12,A Method to Identify p62's UBA Domain Interacting Proteins,2003-12-12,"The UBA domain is a conserved sequence motif among polyubiquitin binding proteins. For the first time, we demonstrate a systematic, high throughput approach to identification of UBA domain-interacting proteins from a proteome-wide perspective. Using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro expression cloning system, we have successfully identified eleven proteins that interact with p62’s UBA domain, and the majority of the eleven proteins are associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, p62 may play a novel regulatory role through its UBA domain. Our approach provides an easy route to the characterization of UBA domain interacting proteins and its application will unfold the important roles that the UBA domain plays.","Pridgeon, Julia W.; Geetha, Thangiah; Wooten, Marie W.",Biol Proced Online,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC302190/,12
69,Multiplexed Genetic Analysis Using an Expanded Genetic Alphabet,2004-11-01,"BACKGROUND: All states require some kind of testing for newborns, but the policies are far from standardized. In some states, newborn screening may include genetic tests for a wide range of targets, but the costs and complexities of the newer genetic tests inhibit expansion of newborn screening. We describe the development and technical evaluation of a multiplex platform that may foster increased newborn genetic screening. METHODS: MultiCode(®) PLx involves three major steps: PCR, target-specific extension, and liquid chip decoding. Each step is performed in the same reaction vessel, and the test is completed in ~3 h. For site-specific labeling and room-temperature decoding, we use an additional base pair constructed from isoguanosine and isocytidine. We used the method to test for mutations within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The developed test was performed manually and by automated liquid handling. Initially, 225 samples with a range of genotypes were tested retrospectively with the method. A prospective study used samples from >400 newborns. RESULTS: In the retrospective study, 99.1% of samples were correctly genotyped with no incorrect calls made. In the perspective study, 95% of the samples were correctly genotyped for all targets, and there were no incorrect calls. CONCLUSIONS: The unique genetic multiplexing platform was successfully able to test for 31 targets within the CFTR gene and provides accurate genotype assignments in a clinical setting.","Johnson, Scott C.; Marshall, David J.; Harms, Gerda; Miller, Christie M.; Sherrill, Christopher B.; Beaty, Edward L.; Lederer, Scott A.; Roesch, Eric B.; Madsen, Gary; Hoffman, Gary L.; Laessig, Ronald H.; Kopish, Greg J.; Baker, Mei Wang; Benner, Steven A.; Farrell, Philip M.; Prudent, James R.",Clinical Chemistry,http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/clinchem/50/11/2019.full.pdf,12
74,Endogenous Cell Repair of Chronic Demyelination,2006-03-01,"In multiple sclerosis lesions, remyelination typically fails with repeated or chronic demyelinating episodes and results in neurologic disability. Acute demyelination models in rodents typically exhibit robust spontaneous remyelination that prevents appropriate evaluation of strategies for improving conditions of insufficient remyelination. In the current study, we used a mouse model of chronic demyelination induced by continuous ingestion of 0.2% cuprizone for 12 weeks. This chronic process depleted the oligodendrocyte progenitor population and impaired oligodendrocyte regeneration. Remyelination remained limited after removal of cuprizone from the diet. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression was persistently increased in the corpus callosum of chronically demyelinated mice as compared with nonlesioned mice. We used FGF2(−/−)mice to determine whether removal of endogenous FGF2 promoted remyelination of chronically demyelinated areas. Wild-type and FGF2(−/−)mice exhibited similar demyelination during chronic cuprizone treatment. Importantly, in contrast to wild-type mice, the FGF2(−/−)mice spontaneously remyelinated completely during the recovery period after chronic demyelination. Increased remyelination in FGF2(−/−)mice correlated with enhanced oligodendroglial regeneration. FGF2 genotype did not alter the density of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells or proliferating cells after chronic demyelination. These findings indicate that attenuating FGF2 created a sufficiently permissive lesion environment for endogenous cells to effectively remyelinate viable axons even after chronic demyelination.","Armstrong, Regina C.; Le, Tuan Q.; Flint, Nicole C.; Vana, Adam C.; Zhou, Yong-Xing",Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology,https://academic.oup.com/jnen/article-pdf/65/3/245/8276837/65-3-245.pdf,12
159,Deletion of human metapneumovirus M2-2 increases mutation frequency and attenuates growth in hamsters,2008-06-03,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection can cause acute lower respiratory tract illness in infants, the immunocompromised, and the elderly. Currently there are no licensed preventative measures for hMPV infections. Using a variant of hMPV/NL/1/00 that does not require trypsin supplementation for growth in tissue culture, we deleted the M2-2 gene and evaluated the replication of rhMPV/ΔM2-2 virus in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that the ablation of M2-2 increased the propensity for insertion of U nucleotides in poly-U tracts of the genomic RNA. In addition, viral transcription was up-regulated although the level of genomic RNA remained comparable to rhMPV. Thus, deletion of M2-2 alters the ratio between hMPV genome copies and transcripts. In vivo, rhMPV/ΔM2-2 was attenuated compared to rhMPV in the lungs and nasal turbinates of hamsters. Hamsters immunized with one dose of rhMPV/ΔM2-2 were protected from challenge with 10(6 )PFU of wild type (wt) hMPV/NL/1/00. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that hMPV M2-2 alters regulation of transcription and influences the fidelity of the polymerase complex during viral genome replication. In the hamster model, rhMPVΔM2-2 is attenuated and protective suggesting that deletion of M2-2 may result in a potential live vaccine candidate. A more thorough knowledge of the hMPV polymerase complex and the role of M2-2 during hMPV replication are being studied as we develop a potential live hMPV vaccine candidate that lacks M2-2 expression.","Schickli, Jeanne H; Kaur, Jasmine; MacPhail, Mia; Guzzetta, Jeanne M; Spaete, Richard R; Tang, Roderick S",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2426676/,12
167,Discovery and Development of Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) Antagonists: A New Paradigm for Treating Sepsis and Other Diseases,2008-05-21,"Sepsis remains the most common cause of death in intensive care units in the USA, with a current estimate of at least 750,000 cases per year, and 215,000 deaths annually. Despite extensive research still we do not quite understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are involved in triggering and propagation of septic injury. Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria, or LPS) has been implicated as a major cause of this syndrome. Inflammatory shock as a consequence of LPS release remains a serious clinical concern. In humans, inflammatory responses to LPS result in the release of cytokines and other cell mediators from monocytes and macrophages, which can cause fever, shock, organ failure and death. A number of different approaches have been investigated to try to treat and/or prevent the septic shock associated with infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, including blockage of one or more of the cytokines induced by LPS. Recently several novel amphipathic compounds have been developed as direct LPS antagonists at the LPS receptor, TLR4. This review article will outline the current knowledge on the TLR4-LPS synthesis and discuss the signaling, in vitro pre-clinical and in vivo clinical evaluation of TLR4 antagonists and their potential use in sepsis and a variety of diseases such as atherosclerosis as well as hepatic and renal malfunction.","Leon, Carlos G.; Tory, Rita; Jia, Jessica; Sivak, Olena; Wasan, Kishor M.",Pharm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2469272/,12
295,Primary biliary cirrhosis,2009-07-15,"Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an immune-mediated chronic cholestatic liver disease with a slowly progressive course. Without treatment, most patients eventually develop fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver and may need liver transplantation in the late stage of disease. PBC primarily affects women (female preponderance 9–10:1) with a prevalence of up to 1 in 1,000 women over 40 years of age. Common symptoms of the disease are fatigue and pruritus, but most patients are asymptomatic at first presentation. The diagnosis is based on sustained elevation of serum markers of cholestasis, i.e., alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, and the presence of serum antimitochondrial antibodies directed against the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Histologically, PBC is characterized by florid bile duct lesions with damage to biliary epithelial cells, an often dense portal inflammatory infiltrate and progressive loss of small intrahepatic bile ducts. Although the insight into pathogenetic aspects of PBC has grown enormously during the recent decade and numerous genetic, environmental, and infectious factors have been disclosed which may contribute to the development of PBC, the precise pathogenesis remains enigmatic. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently the only FDA-approved medical treatment for PBC. When administered at adequate doses of 13–15 mg/kg/day, up to two out of three patients with PBC may have a normal life expectancy without additional therapeutic measures. The mode of action of UDCA is still under discussion, but stimulation of impaired hepatocellular and cholangiocellular secretion, detoxification of bile, and antiapoptotic effects may represent key mechanisms. One out of three patients does not adequately respond to UDCA therapy and may need additional medical therapy and/or liver transplantation. This review summarizes current knowledge on the clinical, diagnostic, pathogenetic, and therapeutic aspects of PBC.","Hohenester, Simon; Oude-Elferink, Ronald P.

351,"Systematic analysis, comparison, and integration of disease based human genetic association data and mouse genetic phenotypic information",2010-01-21,"BACKGROUND: The genetic contributions to human common disorders and mouse genetic models of disease are complex and often overlapping. In common human diseases, unlike classical Mendelian disorders, genetic factors generally have small effect sizes, are multifactorial, and are highly pleiotropic. Likewise, mouse genetic models of disease often have pleiotropic and overlapping phenotypes. Moreover, phenotypic descriptions in the literature in both human and mouse are often poorly characterized and difficult to compare directly. METHODS: In this report, human genetic association results from the literature are summarized with regard to replication, disease phenotype, and gene specific results; and organized in the context of a systematic disease ontology. Similarly summarized mouse genetic disease models are organized within the Mammalian Phenotype ontology. Human and mouse disease and phenotype based gene sets are identified. These disease gene sets are then compared individually and in large groups through dendrogram analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis. RESULTS: Human disease and mouse phenotype gene sets are shown to group into disease and phenotypically relevant groups at both a coarse and fine level based on gene sharing. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides a systematic and global perspective on the genetics of common human disease as compared to itself and in the context of mouse genetic models of disease.","Zhang, Yonqing; De, Supriyo; Garner, John R; Smith, Kirstin; Wang, S Alex; Becker, Kevin G",BMC Med Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2822734/,12

447,Nodeomics: Pathogen Detection in Vertebrate Lymph Nodes Using Meta-Transcriptomics,2010-10-18,"The ongoing emergence of human infections originating from wildlife highlights the need for better knowledge of the microbial community in wildlife species where traditional diagnostic approaches are limited. Here we evaluate the microbial biota in healthy mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) by analyses of lymph node meta-transcriptomes. cDNA libraries from five individuals and two pools of samples were prepared from retropharyngeal lymph node RNA enriched for polyadenylated RNA and sequenced using Roche-454 Life Sciences technology. Protein-coding and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences were taxonomically profiled using protein and rRNA specific databases. Representatives of all bacterial phyla were detected in the seven libraries based on protein-coding transcripts indicating that viable microbiota were present in lymph nodes. Residents of skin and rumen, and those ubiquitous in mule deer habitat dominated classifiable bacterial species. Based on detection of both rRNA and protein-coding transcripts, we identified two new proteobacterial species; a Helicobacter closely related to Helicobacter cetorum in the Helicobacter pylori/Helicobacter acinonychis complex and an Acinetobacter related to Acinetobacter schindleri. Among viruses, a novel gamma retrovirus and other members of the Poxviridae and Retroviridae were identified. We additionally evaluated bacterial diversity by amplicon sequencing the hypervariable V6 region of 16S rRNA and demonstrate that overall taxonomic diversity is higher with the meta-transcriptomic approach. These data provide the most complete picture to date of the microbial diversity within a wildlife host. Our research advances the use of meta-transcriptomics to study microbiota in wildlife tissues, which will facilitate detection of novel organisms with pathogenic potential to human and animals.","Wittekindt, Nicola E.; Padhi, Abinash; Schuster, Stephan C.; Qi, Ji; Zhao, Fangqing; Tomsho, Lynn P.; Kasson, Lindsay R.; Packard, Michael; Cross, Paul; Poss, Mary",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2956653/,12
538,Antibody-Mediated “Universal” Osteoclast Targeting Platform using Calcitonin as a Model Drug,2011-02-08,"PURPOSE: To generate and characterize a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) against recombinant human RANK receptor and to develop an antiresorptive strategy using this mAb as an osteoclast-targeting platform that selectively targets osteoclast cells whilst delivering an attached (i.e. chemically conjugated) active drug cargo. METHODS: Using hybridoma technology, we generated a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) against recombinant human RANK receptor and characterized by SDS PAGE, ELISA, Western Blot and immunocytochemistry, then synthesized osteoclast-targeting bioconjugates of salmon calcitonin (sCT) using this antibody by generating thiol groups on mAb using 2-Iminothiolane and subsequently reacting them with sCT-PEG-MAL synthesised from sCT and NHS-PEG-MAL. To test the efficacy of the conjugate in vitro, osteoclasts were generated from precursor RAW 264.7 cells by dosing with the cytokines macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and RANK Ligand (RANKL) and TRAP activity assay, Resorption Pit Assay, TRAP staining were performed. Cytotoxicity of the mAb-sCT conjugate was also evaluated in RAW 264.7 cells; sCT bioactivity and CTR binding potential were evaluated by in vitro intracellular cAMP stimulation assay in human T47D breast cancer cells. RESULTS: Generation of antibody against human RANK receptor was confirmed by SDS PAGE, ELISA and Western Blot. Immunocytochemistry confirmed the osteoclast targeting potential of the antibody. Successful conjugation of the antibody with sCT was confirmed by SDS PAGE and ELISA.Multinucleated osteoclast formation was confirmed by staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Conjugate functionality was confirmed by TRAP activity and Resorption Pit assay, showing the inhibitory effect on osteoclast differentiation. cAMP assay confirmed the retention of calcitonin bioactivity after conjugation. CONCLUSIONS: Our strategy offers the potential for a “universal” osteoclast-targeting platform—one that targets the RANK receptor on osteoclast cells by simply altering the conjugated cargo in order to affect the specific regulation of osteoclast cells.","Newa, Madhuri; Bhandari, Krishna Hari; Tang, Lili; Kalvapalle, Rohit; Suresh, Mavanur; Doschak, Michael R.",Pharm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3073043/,12
551,Transmission Potential of Chikungunya Virus and Control Measures: The Case of Italy,2011-05-03,"During summer 2007 Italy has experienced an epidemic caused by Chikungunya virus – the first large outbreak documented in a temperate climate country – with approximately 161 laboratory confirmed cases concentrated in two bordering villages in North–Eastern Italy comprising 3,968 inhabitants. The seroprevalence was recently estimated to be 10.2%. In this work we provide estimates of the transmission potential of the virus and we assess the efficacy of the measures undertaken by public health authorities to control the epidemic spread. To such aim, we developed a model describing the temporal dynamics of the competent vector, known as Aedes albopictus, explicitly depending on climatic factors, coupled to an epidemic transmission model describing the spread of the epidemic in both humans and mosquitoes. The cumulative number of notified cases predicted by the model was 185 on average (95% CI 117–278), in good agreement with observed data. The probability of observing a major outbreak after the introduction of an infective human case was estimated to be in the range of 32%–76%. We found that the basic reproduction number was in the range of 1.8–6 but it could have been even larger, depending on the density of mosquitoes, which in turn depends on seasonal meteorological effects, besides other local abiotic factors. These results confirm the increasing risk of tropical vector–borne diseases in temperate climate countries, as a consequence of globalization. However, our results show that an epidemic can be controlled by performing a timely intervention, even if the transmission potential of Chikungunya virus is sensibly high.","Poletti, Piero; Messeri, Gianni; Ajelli, Marco; Vallorani, Roberto; Rizzo, Caterina; Merler, Stefano",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3086881/,12
658,Improved Immunological Tolerance Following Combination Therapy with CTLA-4/Ig and AAV-Mediated PD-L1/2 Muscle Gene Transfer,2011-09-29,"Initially thought as being non-immunogenic, recombinant AAVs have emerged as efficient vector candidates for treating monogenic diseases. It is now clear however that they induce potent immune responses against transgene products which can lead to destruction of transduced cells. Therefore, developing strategies to circumvent these immune responses and facilitate long-term expression of transgenic therapeutic proteins is a main challenge in gene therapy. We evaluated herein a strategy to inhibit the undesirable immune activation that follows muscle gene transfer by administration of CTLA-4/Ig to block the costimulatory signals required early during immune priming and by using gene transfer of PD-1 ligands to inhibit T cell functions at the tissue sites. We provide the proof of principle that this combination immunoregulatory therapy targeting two non-redundant checkpoints of the immune response, i.e., priming and effector functions, can improve persistence of transduced cells in experimental settings where cytotoxic T cells escape initial blockade. Therefore, CTLA-4/Ig plus PD-L1/2 combination therapy represents a candidate approach to circumvent the bottleneck of immune responses directed toward transgene products.","Adriouch, Sahil; Franck, Emilie; Drouot, Laurent; Bonneau, Carole; Jolinon, Nelly; Salvetti, Anna; Boyer, Olivier",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3202221/,12
713,"Molecular mechanisms of inflammation and tissue injury after major trauma-is complement the ""bad guy""?",2011-11-30,"Trauma represents the leading cause of death among young people in industrialized countries. Recent clinical and experimental studies have brought increasing evidence for activation of the innate immune system in contributing to the pathogenesis of trauma-induced sequelae and adverse outcome. As the ""first line of defense"", the complement system represents a potent effector arm of innate immunity, and has been implicated in mediating the early posttraumatic inflammatory response. Despite its generic beneficial functions, including pathogen elimination and immediate response to danger signals, complement activation may exert detrimental effects after trauma, in terms of mounting an ""innocent bystander"" attack on host tissue. Posttraumatic ischemia/reperfusion injuries represent the classic entity of complement-mediated tissue damage, adding to the ""antigenic load"" by exacerbation of local and systemic inflammation and release of toxic mediators. These pathophysiological sequelae have been shown to sustain the systemic inflammatory response syndrome after major trauma, and can ultimately contribute to remote organ injury and death. Numerous experimental models have been designed in recent years with the aim of mimicking the inflammatory reaction after trauma and to allow the testing of new pharmacological approaches, including the emergent concept of site-targeted complement inhibition. The present review provides an overview on the current understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of complement activation after major trauma, with an emphasis of emerging therapeutic concepts which may provide the rationale for a ""bench-to-bedside"" approach in the design of future pharmacological strategies.","Neher, Miriam D; Weckbach, Sebastian; Flierl, Michael A; Huber-Lang, Markus S; Stahel, Philip F",J Biomed Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3247859/,12

1295,Inflammation and Immune System Activation in Aging: A Mathematical Approach,2013-11-19,"Memory and learning declines are consequences of normal aging. Since those functions are associated with the hippocampus, I analyzed the global gene expression data from post-mortem hippocampal tissue of 25 old (age ≥ 60 yrs) and 15 young (age ≤ 45 yrs) cognitively intact human subjects. By employing a rigorous, multi-method bioinformatic approach, I identified 36 genes that were the most significant in terms of differential expression; and by employing mathematical modeling, I demonstrated that 7 of the 36 genes were able to discriminate between the old and young subjects with high accuracy. Remarkably, 90% of the known genes from those 36 most significant genes are associated with either inflammation or immune system activation. This suggests that chronic inflammation and immune system over-activity may underlie the aging process of the human brain, and that potential anti-inflammatory treatments targeting those genes may slow down this process and alleviate its symptoms.","Nikas, Jason B.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3832874/,12
1299,Defining the Range of Pathogens Susceptible to Ifitm3 Restriction Using a Knockout Mouse Model,2013-11-21,"The interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) family of proteins has been shown to restrict a broad range of viruses in vitro and in vivo by halting progress through the late endosomal pathway. Further, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in its sequence have been linked with risk of developing severe influenza virus infections in humans. The number of viruses restricted by this host protein has continued to grow since it was first demonstrated as playing an antiviral role; all of which enter cells via the endosomal pathway. We therefore sought to test the limits of antimicrobial restriction by Ifitm3 using a knockout mouse model. We showed that Ifitm3 does not impact on the restriction or pathogenesis of bacterial (Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter rodentium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or protozoan (Plasmodium berghei) pathogens, despite in vitro evidence. However, Ifitm3 is capable of restricting respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in vivo either through directly restricting RSV cell infection, or by exerting a previously uncharacterised function controlling disease pathogenesis. This represents the first demonstration of a virus that enters directly through the plasma membrane, without the need for the endosomal pathway, being restricted by the IFITM family; therefore further defining the role of these antiviral proteins.","Everitt, Aaron R.; Clare, Simon; McDonald, Jacqueline U.; Kane, Leanne; Harcourt, Katherine; Ahras, Malika; Lall, Amar; Hale, Christine; Rodgers, Angela; Young, Douglas B.; Haque, Ashraful; Billker, Oliver; Tregoning, John S.; Dougan, Gordon; Kellam, Paul",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836756/,12
1319,Effect of hepatocyte growth factor and angiotensin II on rat cardiomyocyte hypertrophy,2012-10-15,"Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays an important role in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The combined effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and Ang II on cardiomyocytes is unknown. The present study was designed to determine the effect of HGF on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and to explore the combined effect of HGF and Ang II on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from neonatal rat hearts and cultured in vitro. Cells were treated with Ang II (1 µM) alone, HGF (10 ng/mL) alone, and Ang II (1 µM) plus HGF (10 ng/mL) for 24, 48, and 72 h. The amount of [(3)H]-leucine incorporation was then measured to evaluate protein synthesis. The mRNA levels of β-myosin heavy chain and atrial natriuretic factor were determined by real-time PCR to evaluate the presence of fetal phenotypes of gene expression. The cell size of cardiomyocytes was also studied. Ang II (1 µM) increased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Similar to Ang II, treatment with 1 µM HGF promoted cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Moreover, the combination of 1 µM Ang II and 10 ng/mL HGF clearly induced a combined pro-hypertrophy effect on cardiomyocytes. The present study demonstrates for the first time a novel, combined effect of HGF and Ang II in promoting cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.","Chen, Ai-Lan; Ou, Cai-Wen; He, Zhao-Chu; Liu, Qi-Cai; Dong, Qi; Chen, Min-Sheng",Braz J Med Biol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3854218/,12
1406,Glioblastoma extracellular vesicles: reservoirs of potential biomarkers,2014-02-13,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent and most devastating of the primary central nervous system tumors, with few patients living beyond 2 years postdiagnosis. The damage caused by the disease and our treatments for the patients often leave them physically and cognitively debilitated. Generally, GBMs appear after very short clinical histories and are discovered by imaging (using magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and the diagnosis is validated by pathology, following surgical resection. The treatment response and diagnosis of tumor recurrence are also tracked by MRI, but there are numerous problems encountered with these monitoring modalities, such as ambiguous interpretation and forms of pseudoprogression. Diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers would be an immense boon in following treatment schemes and in determining recurrence, which often requires an invasive intracranial biopsy to verify imaging data. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are stable, membrane-enclosed, virus-sized particles released from either the cell surface or from endosomal pathways that lead to the systemic release of EVs into accessible biofluids, such as serum/plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva. EVs carry a wide variety of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other metabolites, with many common features but with enough individuality to be able to identify the cell of origin of the vesicles. These components, if properly interrogated, could allow for the identification of tumor-derived EVs in biofluids, indicating tumor progression, relapse, or treatment failure. That knowledge would allow clinicians to continue with treatment regimens that were actually effective or to change course if the therapies were failing. Here, we review the features of GBM EVs, in terms of EV content and activities that may lead to the use of EVs as serially accessible biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment response in neuro-oncology.","Redzic, Jasmina S; Ung, Timothy H; Graner, Michael W",Pharmgenomics Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3952682/,12

In the last few decades, Schiff bases and their complexes have become well known for their extensive biological potential. In the present study, we examined the antiproliferative effect of a copper (II) complex on HT-29 colon cancer cells. The Cu(BrHAP)(2 ) Schiff base compound demonstrated a potent antiproliferative effect in HT-29 cells, with an IC(50 )value of 2.87 μg/ml after 72 h of treatment. HT-29 cells treated with Cu (II) complexes underwent apoptosis death, as exhibited by a progressive elevation in the proportion of the G(1 ) cell population. At a concentration of 6.25 μg/ml, the Cu(BrHAP)(2 ) compound caused significant elevation in ROS production following perturbation of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release, as assessed by the measurement of fluorescence intensity in stained cells. Furthermore, the activation of caspases 3/7 and 9 was part of the Cu (II) complex-induced apoptosis, which confirmed the involvement of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Meanwhile, there was no significant activation of caspase-8.

1614,Identification of Antigenic Proteins of the Nosocomial Pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae,2014-10-21,"The continuous expansion of nosocomial infections around the globe has become a precarious situation. Key challenges include mounting dissemination of multiple resistances to antibiotics, the easy transmission and the growing mortality rates of hospital-acquired bacterial diseases. Thus, new ways to rapidly detect these infections are vital. Consequently, researchers around the globe pursue innovative approaches for point-of-care devices. In many cases the specific interaction of an antigen and a corresponding antibody is pivotal. However, the knowledge about suitable antigens is lacking. The aim of this study was to identify novel antigens as specific diagnostic markers. Additionally, these proteins might be aptly used for the generation of vaccines to improve current treatment options. Hence, a cDNA-based expression library was constructed and screened via microarrays to detect novel antigens of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a prominent agent of nosocomial infections well-known for its extensive antibiotics resistance, especially by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). After screening 1536 clones, 14 previously unknown immunogenic proteins were identified. Subsequently, each protein was expressed in full-length and its immunodominant character examined by ELISA and microarray analyses. Consequently, six proteins were selected for epitope mapping and three thereof possessed linear epitopes. After specificity analysis, homology survey and 3d structural modelling, one epitope sequence GAVVALSTTFA of KPN_00363, an ion channel protein, was identified harboring specificity for K. pneumoniae. The remaining epitopes showed ambiguous results regarding the specificity for K. pneumoniae. The approach adopted herein has been successfully utilized to discover novel antigens of Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica antigens before. Now, we have transferred this knowledge to the key nosocomial agent, K. pneumoniae. By identifying several novel antigens and their linear epitope sites, we have paved the way for crucial future research and applications including the design of point-of-care devices, vaccine development and serological screenings for a highly relevant nosocomial pathogen.","Hoppe, Sebastian; Bier, Frank F.; von Nickisch-Rosenegk, Markus",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4205017/,12
1700,Exploration of diarrhoea seasonality and its drivers in China,2015-02-04,"This study investigated the diarrhoea seasonality and its potential drivers as well as potential opportunities for future diarrhoea control and prevention in China. Data on weekly infectious diarrhoea cases in 31 provinces of China from 2005 to 2012, and data on demographic and geographic characteristics, as well as climatic factors, were complied. A cosinor function combined with a Poisson regression was used to calculate the three seasonal parameters of diarrhoea in different provinces. Regression tree analysis was used to identify the predictors of diarrhoea seasonality. Diarrhoea cases in China showed a bimodal distribution. Diarrhoea in children <5 years was more likely to peak in fall-winter seasons, while diarrhoea in persons > = 5 years peaked in summer. Latitude was significantly associated with spatial pattern of diarrhoea seasonality, with peak and trough times occurring earlier at high latitudes (northern areas), and later at low latitudes (southern areas). The annual amplitudes of diarrhoea in persons > = 5 years increased with latitude (r = 0.62, P<0.001). Latitude 27.8° N and 38.65° N were the latitudinal thresholds for diarrhoea seasonality in China. Regional-specific diarrhoea control and prevention strategies may be optimal for China. More attention should be paid to diarrhoea in children <5 years during fall-winter seasons.","Xu, Zhiwei; Hu, Wenbiao; Zhang, Yewu; Wang, Xiaofeng; Zhou, Maigeng; Su, Hong; Huang, Cunrui; Tong, Shilu; Guo, Qing",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4316158/,12
1777,Age-Related Onset of Obesity Corresponds with Metabolic Dysregulation and Altered Microglia Morphology in Mice Deficient for Ifitm Proteins,2015-04-09,"The IfitmDel mouse lacks all five of the Ifitm genes via LoxP deletion. This animal breeds normally with no obvious defect in development. The IfitmDel animals exhibit a steady and significantly enhanced weight gain relative to wild-type controls beginning about three months of age and under normal feeding conditions. The increased weight corresponds with elevated fat mass, and in tolerance tests they are hyporesponsive to insulin but respond normally to glucose. Both young (4 mo) and older (12 mo) IfitmDel mice have enhanced levels of serum leptin suggesting a defect in leptin/leptin receptor signaling. Analysis of the gene expression profiles in the hypothalamus of IfitmDel animals, compared to WT, demonstrated an altered ratio of Pomc and Npy neuropeptide expression, which likely impairs the satiation response of the IfitmDel animal leading to an increased eating behavior. Also elevated in hypothalamus of IfitmDel mice were pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and reduced IL-10. Anatomical analysis of the hypothalamus using immunohistochemistry revealed that microglia exhibit an abnormal morphology in IfitmDel animals and respond abnormally to Poly:IC challenge. These abnormalities extend the phenotype of the IfitmDel mouse beyond abnormal responses to viral challenge to include a metabolic phenotype and weight gain. Further, this novel phenotype for the IfitmDel mouse could be related to abnormal neuropeptide production, inflammatory status and microglia status in the hypothalamus.","Wee, Yin Shen; Weis, Janis J.; Gahring, Lorise C.; Rogers, Scott W.; Weis, John H.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4391874/,12
1858,DNA transducer-triggered signal switch for visual colorimetric bioanalysis,2015-06-10,"A simple and versatile colorimetric biosensor has been developed for sensitive and specific detection of a wide range of biomolecules, such as oligonucleotides and aptamer-recognized targets. Combining the signal transducer and catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA)-based signal amplification, the target DNA binds with the hairpin DNA to form a new nucleic acid sequence and creates a toehold in the transducer for initiating the recycle amplification reaction of CHA. The catalyzed assembly process produces a large amount of G-rich DNA. In the presence of hemin, the G-rich DNA forms G-quadruplex/hemin complex and mimic horseradish peroxidase activity, which catalyzes a colorimetric reaction. Under optimal conditions, the calibration curve of synthetic target DNA has good linearity from 50 pM to 200 nM with a detection limit of 32 pM. This strategy has been successfully applied to detect S. pneumoniae as low as 156 CFU mL(−1), and shows a good specificity against closely related streptococci and major pathogenic bacteria. In addition, the developed method enables successful visual analysis of S. pneumoniae in clinical samples by the naked eye. Importantly, this method demonstrates excellent assay versatility for sensitively detecting oligonucleotides or aptamer-recognized targets.","Chen, Wenhong; Yan, Yurong; Zhang, Ye; Zhang, Xuemei; Yin, Yibing; Ding, Shijia",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4462091/,12
1894,"Mid-Season Estimates of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness against Influenza A(H3N2) Hospitalization in the Elderly in Quebec, Canada, January 2015",2015-07-22,"BACKGROUND: The 2014/15 influenza season in Canada was characterized by an early epidemic due to vaccine-mismatched influenza A(H3N2) viruses, disproportionately affecting elderly individuals ≥65-years-old. We assessed vaccine effectiveness (VE) against A(H3N2) hospitalization among elderly individuals during the peak weeks of the 2014/15 epidemic in Quebec, Canada. METHODS: Nasal specimens and clinical/epidemiological data were collected within 7 days of illness onset from elderly patients admitted with respiratory symptoms to one of four participating hospitals between November 30, 2014 and January 13, 2015. Cases tested RT-PCR positive for influenza A(H3N2) and controls tested negative for any influenza. VE was assessed by test-negative case-control design. RESULTS: There were 314 participants including 186 cases (62% vaccinated) and 128 controls (59% vaccinated) included in primary VE analysis. Median age was 81.5 years, two-thirds were admitted from the community and 91% had underlying comorbidity. Crude VE against A(H3N2) hospitalization was -17% (95%CI: -86% to 26%), decreasing to -23% (95%CI: -99 to 23%) with adjustment for age and comorbidity, and to -39% (95%CI: -142 to 20%) with additional adjustment for specimen collection interval, calendar time, type of residence and hospital. In sensitivity analyses, VE estimates were improved toward the null with restriction to participants admitted from the community (-2%; 95%CI: -105 to 49%) or with specimen collection ≤4 days since illness onset (- 8%; 95%CI: -104 to 43%) but further from the null with restriction to participants with comorbidity (-51%; 95%CI: -169 to 15%). CONCLUSION: The 2014/15 mismatched influenza vaccine provided elderly patients with no cross-protection against hospitalization with the A(H3N2) epidemic strain, reinforcing the need for adjunct protective measures among high-risk individuals and improved vaccine options.","Gilca, Rodica; Skowronski, Danuta M.; Douville-Fradet, Monique; Amini, Rachid; Boulianne, Nicole; Rouleau, Isabelle; Martineau, Christine; Charest, Hugues; De Serres, Gaston",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4511737/,12

This article provides for the first time a description and a line list for all outbreaks in this country, comprising 996 cases. Compared to patients over 15 years old, the odds of dying were significantly lower in patients aged 5 to 15 and higher in children under five (with 100% mortality in those under 2 years old). The odds of dying increased by 11% per day that a patient was not hospitalised. Outbreaks with an initially high reproduction number, R (>3), were rapidly brought under control, whilst outbreaks with a lower initial R caused longer and generally larger outbreaks. These findings can inform the choice of target age groups for interventions and highlight the importance of both reducing the delay between symptom onset and hospitalisation and rapid national and international response.

2067,Two novel regulators of N‐acetyl‐galactosamine utilization pathway and distinct roles in bacterial infections,2015-11-05,"Bacterial pathogens can exploit metabolic pathways to facilitate their successful infection cycles, but little is known about roles of d‐galactosamine (GalN)/N‐acetyl‐d‐galactosamine (GalNAc) catabolism pathway in bacterial pathogenesis. Here, we report the genomic reconstruction of GalN/GalNAc utilization pathway in Streptococci and the diversified aga regulons. We delineated two new paralogous AgaR regulators for the GalN/GalNAc catabolism pathway. The electrophoretic mobility shift assays experiment demonstrated that AgaR2 (AgaR1) binds the predicted palindromes, and the combined in vivo data from reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and RNA‐seq suggested that AgaR2 (not AgaR1) can effectively repress the transcription of the target genes. Removal of agaR2 (not agaR1) from Streptococcus suis 05ZYH33 augments significantly the abilities of both adherence to Hep‐2 cells and anti‐phagocytosis against RAW264.7 macrophage. As anticipated, the dysfunction in AgaR2‐mediated regulation of S. suis impairs its pathogenicity in experimental models of both mice and piglets. Our finding discovered two novel regulators specific for GalN/GalNAc catabolism and assigned them distinct roles into bacterial infections. To the best of our knowledge, it might represent a first paradigm that links the GalN/GalNAc catabolism pathway to bacterial pathogenesis.","Zhang, Huimin; Ravcheev, Dmitry A.; Hu, Dan; Zhang, Fengyu; Gong, Xiufang; Hao, Lina; Cao, Min; Rodionov, Dmitry A.; Wang, Changjun; Feng, Youjun",Microbiologyopen,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4694137/,12
2103,Domain swapping oligomerization of thermostable c-type cytochrome in E. coli cells,2016-02-03,"Knowledge on domain swapping in vitro is increasing, but domain swapping may not occur regularly in vivo, and its information in cells is limited. Herein, we show that domain-swapped oligomers of a thermostable c-type cytochrome, Hydrogenobacter thermophilus cyt c(552), are formed in E. coli which expresses cyt c(552). The region containing the N-terminal α-helix and heme was domain-swapped between protomers in the dimer formed in E. coli. The amount of cyt c(552) oligomers increased in E. coli as the cyt c(552) concentration was increased, whereas that of high-order oligomers decreased in the order of decrease in protein stability, indicating that domain swapping decreases in cells when the protein stability decreases. Apo cyt c(552) was detected in the cyt c(552) oligomer formed in E. coli, but not in that of the A5F/M11V/Y32F/Y41E/I76V mutant. The cyt c(552) oligomer containing its apo protein may form at the periplasm, since the apo protein detected by mass measurements did not contain the signal peptide. These results show that domain-swapped cyt c(552) oligomers were formed in E. coli, owing to the stability of the transient oligomer containing the apo protein before heme attachment. This is an indication that exceedingly stable proteins may have disadvantages forming domain-swapped oligomers in cells.","Hayashi, Yugo; Yamanaka, Masaru; Nagao, Satoshi; Komori, Hirofumi; Higuchi, Yoshiki; Hirota, Shun",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4738263/,12
2211,“TRP inflammation” relationship in cardiovascular system,2015-10-19,"Despite considerable advances in the research and treatment, the precise relationship between inflammation and cardiovascular (CV) disease remains incompletely understood. Therefore, understanding the immunoinflammatory processes underlying the initiation, progression, and exacerbation of many cardiovascular diseases is of prime importance. The innate immune system has an ancient origin and is well conserved across species. Its activation occurs in response to pathogens or tissue injury. Recent studies suggest that altered ionic balance, and production of noxious gaseous mediators link to immune and inflammatory responses with altered ion channel expression and function. Among plausible candidates for this are transient receptor potential (TRP) channels that function as polymodal sensors and scaffolding proteins involved in many physiological and pathological processes. In this review, we will first focus on the relevance of TRP channel to both exogenous and endogenous factors related to innate immune response and transcription factors related to sustained inflammatory status. The emerging role of inflammasome to regulate innate immunity and its possible connection to TRP channels will also be discussed. Secondly, we will discuss about the linkage of TRP channels to inflammatory CV diseases, from a viewpoint of inflammation in a general sense which is not restricted to the innate immunity. These knowledge may serve to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of various inflammatory CV diseases and their novel therapeutic strategies.","Numata, Tomohiro; Takahashi, Kiriko; Inoue, Ryuji",Semin Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4851701/,12

Host responses to tissue infection elicit acute inflammation in an attempt to control invading pathogens. SPMs are lipid mediators that are part of a larger family of pro-resolving molecules, which includes proteins and gases, that together restrain inflammation and resolve the infection. These immunoresolvents are distinct from immunosuppressive molecules as they not only dampen inflammation but also promote host defence.

Currently, no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutics are available. Several FDA-approved drugs, including selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), possess selective anti-Ebola activities. However, the inhibitory mechanisms of these drugs remain elusive. By analyzing the structures of SERMs and their incidental biological activity (cholesterol accumulation), we hypothesized that this incidental biological activity induced by SERMs could be a plausible mechanism as to their inhibitory effects on Ebola infection. Herein, we demonstrated that the same dosages of SERMs which induced cholesterol accumulation also inhibited Ebola infection. SERMs reduced the cellular sphingosine and subsequently caused endolysosomal calcium accumulation, which in turn led to blocking the Ebola entry. Our study clarified the specific anti-Ebola mechanism of SERMs, even the cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs), this mechanism led to the endolysosomal calcium as a critical target for development of anti-Ebola drugs.","Fan, Hanlu; Du, Xiaohong; Zhang, Jingyuan; Zheng, Han; Lu, Xiaohui; Wu, Qihui; Li, Haifeng; Wang, Han; Shi, Yi; Gao, George; Zhou, Zhuan; Tan, Dun-Xian; Li, Xiangdong",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5259750/,12

Most often these rates must be estimated from longitudinal field data, which are costly and time-consuming to conduct. Consequently, measures to reduce cost like increased sampling intervals or subsampling of the population are implemented. To assess the impact of such measures we implement two different SIS models to simulate disease transmission: A simple closed population model and a realistic dairy herd including population dynamics. We analyze the accuracy of different methods for estimating the transmission rate. We use data from the two simulation models and vary the sampling intervals and the size of the population sampled. We devise two new methods to determine transmission rate, and compare these to the frequently used Poisson regression method in both epidemic and endemic situations. For most tested scenarios these new methods perform similar or better than Poisson regression, especially in the case of long sampling intervals. We conclude that transmission rate estimates are easily biased, which is important to take into account when using these rates in simulation models.","Kirkeby, Carsten; Halasa, Tariq; Gussmann, Maya; Toft, Nils; Græsbøll, Kaare",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5572698/,12
2886,Viscosity is an important factor of resistance to alcohol-based disinfectants by pathogens present in mucus,2017-10-13,"Alcohol-based disinfectants play an important role in the prevention of healthcare-acquired infection (HAI). We investigated whether pathogens present in mucus acquire resistance to alcohol-based disinfectants, and elucidated the underlying mechanism. Both the resistance of influenza A virus and Escherichia coli to alcohol-based disinfectants or ultraviolet irradiation and the diffusion rate of ethanol were determined in artificial mucus or sputum samples obtained from 27 individuals with acute upper respiratory infection. Pathogens in mucus (artificial mucus or sputum samples) were not completely inactivated by alcohol-based disinfectants (survival rate >10%), suggesting that the alcohol-based disinfectants were ineffective. Pathogen survival and mucus viscosity were strongly correlated (correlation coefficient >0.7, P < 0.001). Additionally, the ethanol diffusion rate decreased with increasing mucus viscosity, which contributed to ethanol resistance. Pronase treatment of sputum samples significantly decreased sputum viscosity and increased the disinfectant effect (P < 0.001 for all). In contrast, complete inactivation was achieved by ultraviolet irradiation independently of mucus viscosity. Thus, mucus viscosity contributes to resistance of pathogens to alcohol-based disinfectants by decreasing the alcohol diffusion rate. These findings can provide a basis for developing new strategies, including improved disinfectants, for overcoming HAI.","Hirose, Ryohei; Nakaya, Takaaki; Naito, Yuji; Daidoji, Tomo; Watanabe, Yohei; Yasuda, Hiroaki; Konishi, Hideyuki; Itoh, Yoshito",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5640602/,12

A significant rearrangement of host cell vimentin around Toxoplasma parasitophorous vacuoles is observed during the course of infection. ROP18 (TgROP18) is a serine-threonine kinase secreted by T. gondii rhoptry and a major virulence factor; however, the mechanisms by which this kinase modulates host factors remain poorly understood. Different and dynamic patterns of vimentin solubility, phosphorylation, and expression levels were observed in host cells infected with T. gondii strain RH and RH Δrop18 strains, suggesting that TgROP18 contributes to the regulation of these dynamic patterns. Additionally, host cell vimentin was demonstrated to interact with and be phosphorylated by TgROP18. A significant increase in T. gondii infection rate was observed in vimentin knockout human brain microvessel endothelial cells (HBMEC), while vimentin knockout or knock down in host cells had no impact on parasite proliferation and egress. These results indicate that host cell vimentin can inhibit T. gondii invasion. Interestingly, western blotting of different mouse tissues indicated that the lowest vimentin expression level was present in the brain, which may explain the mechanism underlying the nervous system tropism of T. gondii, and the phenomenon of huge cyst burdens developing in the mouse brain during chronic infection.","He, Cheng; Kong, Ling; Zhou, Lijuan; Xia, Jing; Wei, Haixia; Liu, Min; Peng, Hongjuan",Int J Biol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666328/,12

Much progress has been made investigating the role of ubiquitin ligases at the synapse, however very little is known about the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) which remove ubiquitin from target proteins. Although there are far fewer DUBs than ubiquitin ligases encoded by the human genome, it is becoming clear that DUBs have very specific physiological functions, suggesting that DUB activity is tightly regulated in vivo. Many DUBs function as part of larger protein complexes, and multiple regulatory mechanisms exist to control the expression, localization and catalytic activity of DUBs. In this review article, we focus on the role of the DUB USP46 in the nervous system, and illustrate potential mechanisms of regulating DUBs by describing how USP46 is regulated by two WD40-repeat (WDR) proteins, WDR48/UAF1 and WDR20, based on recent structural studies and genetic analyses in vivo.","Hodul, Molly; Dahlberg, Caroline L.; Juo, Peter",Front Synaptic Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5735123/,12

Despite the fact that the generated proteases are all present together in the blood, under physiological conditions, the activity of the generated proteases is controlled by endogenous protease inhibitors. Consequently, there is remarkable little crosstalk between the different systems in the fluid phase. This concept review article aims at identifying and describing conditions where the strict system-related control is circumvented. These include clinical settings where massive amounts of proteolytic enzymes are released from tissues, e.g., during pancreatitis or post-traumatic tissue damage, resulting in consumption of the natural substrates of the specific proteases and the available protease inhibitor. Another example of cascade system dysregulation is disseminated intravascular coagulation, with canonical activation of all cascade systems of the blood, also leading to specific substrate and protease inhibitor elimination.

3165,New Insights from Elucidating the Role of LMP1 in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,2018-03-21,"Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) oncogenic protein that has no intrinsic enzymatic activity or sequence homology to cellular or viral proteins. The oncogenic potential of LMP1 has been ascribed to pleiotropic signaling properties initiated through protein-protein interactions in cytosolic membrane compartments, but the effects of LMP1 extend to nuclear and extracellular processes. Although LMP1 is one of the latent genes required for EBV-immortalization of B cells, the biology of LMP1 in the pathogenesis of the epithelial cancer nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is more complex. NPC is prevalent in specific regions of the world with high incidence in southeast China. The epidemiology and time interval from seroconversion to NPC onset in adults would suggest the involvement of multiple risk factors that complement the establishment of a latent and persistent EBV infection. The contribution of LMP1 to EBV pathogenesis in polarized epithelia has only recently begun to be elucidated. Furthermore, the LMP1 gene has emerged as one of the most divergent sequences in the EBV genome. This review will discuss the significance of recent advances in NPC research from elucidating LMP1 function in epithelial cells and lessons that could be learned from mining LMP1 sequence diversity.","Shair, Kathy H.

3616,A Novel Supplementation Approach to Enhance Host Response to Sublingual Vaccination,2019-01-24,"Sublingual immunization is emerging as an alternative to nasal immunization and induction of mucosal IgA responses. Using Bacillus anthracis edema toxin (EdTx) as an adjuvant, we previously showed that innate responses triggered after sublingual immunization could limit generation of IgA responses. We tested whether co-administration of a neutrophil elastase inhibitor (NEI) could rescue the ability of EdTx to induce broad antibody responses, including mucosal IgA. NEI supplementation of sublingual vaccines containing EdTx promoted antigen-specific serum IgA responses but also enhanced serum IgG1, and IgG2b responses. This enhancing effect of NEI did not extend to all antibody isotypes and IgG sublclasses, since NEI reduced serum IgE responses and did not affect IgG2a/c and IgG3 responses. NEI supplementation also promoted anti-Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA) neutralizing antibodies and enhanced high affinity IgG1 and IgA antibodies. In addition to serum IgA, NEI supplementation stimulated antigen-specific mucosal IgA responses in the GI tract, and enhanced antigen-specific IgG responses in vaginal washes. Analysis of CD4(+) T helper cell responses revealed that co-administration of NEI broadened the profile of cytokine responses, by stimulating Th1, Th2, Th17, and Tfh cytokines. We also noted that NEI had a higher stimulatory effect on IL-5, IL-10, IL-17 responses.","Rowe, John C.; Attia, Zayed; Kim, Eunsoo; Cormet-Boyaka, Estelle; Boyaka, Prosper N.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6346055/,12

A total of 37 children (62 days-12 years [median 5.5 years]) were included in this study. Pneumocystis was diagnosed by microscopy using Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain in 12 cases and by nested PCR using mtLSUrRNA in 25 cases. Genotyping was performed using three different genes, mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (mtLSUrRNA), dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). mtLSUrRNA genotype 3 and novel mutations at the gene target DHFR (401 T > C) and DHPS 96/98 were frequently observed and clinically associated with severe PCP and treatment failure. Phylogenetic analyses revealed 13 unique sequence types (STs). Two STs (i) 3-DHFR 401 T > C-DHPS 96/98 – PJ1 and (ii) 3-DHFR 401 T > C-DHPS 96- PJ3 were significantly associated with treatment failure and high mortality among PCP-positive patients. In conclusion, the present study strongly suggests the emergence of virulent P. jirovecii strains or genetic polymorphisms, leading to treatment failure and high mortality. Our study is the first of its kind from the Indian subcontinent and has highlighted the genetic diversity of Pneumocystis jirovecii among children and their clinical outcomes. These findings emphasize the need to focus more on genotypes to better understand the epidemiology of Pneumocystis pneumonia.","Singh, Yogita; Mirdha, Bijay Ranjan; Guleria, Randeep; Kabra, Sushil K.; Mohan, Anant; Chaudhry, Rama; Kumar, Lalit; Dwivedi, Sada Nand; Agarwal, Sanjay K.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6361943/,12
3676,Bacillus Calmette-Guérin Induces PD-L1 Expression on Antigen-Presenting Cells via Autocrine and Paracrine Interleukin-STAT3 Circuits,2019-03-06,"Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the only licensed vaccine for tuberculosis (TB), and is also used as an immunotherapy for bladder cancer and other malignancies due to its immunostimulatory properties. Mycobacteria spp., however, are well known for their numerous immune evasion mechanisms that limit the true potential of their therapeutic use. One such major mechanism is the induction of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which mitigates adaptive immune responses. Here, we sought to unravel the molecular pathways behind PD-L1 up-regulation on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by BCG. We found that infection of APCs with BCG induced PD-L1 up-regulation, but that this did not depend on direct infection, suggesting a soluble mediator for this effect. BCG induced potent quantities of IL-6 and IL-10, and the downstream transcription factor STAT3 was hyper-phosphorylated. Intracellular analyses revealed that levels of PD-L1 molecules were associated with the STAT3 phosphorylation state, suggesting a causal link. Neutralisation of the IL-6 or IL-10 cytokine receptors dampened STAT3 phosphorylation and BCG-mediated up-regulation of PD-L1 on APCs. Pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 achieved the same effect, confirming an autocrine-paracrine cytokine loop as a mechanism for BCG-mediated up-regulation of PD-L1. Finally, an in vivo immunisation model showed that BCG vaccination under PD-L1 blockade could enhance antigen-specific memory CD4 T-cell responses. These novel findings could lead to refinement of BCG as both a vaccine for infectious disease and as a cancer immunotherapy.","Copland, Alastair; Sparrow, Adam; Hart, Peter; Diogo, Gil Reynolds; Paul, Mathew; Azuma, Miyuki; Reljic, Rajko",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6403281/,12
3731,"The Role of Microglia in Bacterial Meningitis: Inflammatory Response, Experimental Models and New Neuroprotective Therapeutic Strategies",2019-03-25,"Microglia have a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis. The goal of this review is to provide an overview on how microglia respond to bacterial pathogens targeting the brain, how the interplay between microglia and bacteria can be studied experimentally, and possible ways to use gained knowledge to identify novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. We discuss the dual role of microglia in disease development, the beneficial functions crucial for bacterial clearing, and the destructive properties through triggering neuroinflammation, characterized by cytokine and chemokine release which leads to leukocyte trafficking through the brain vascular endothelium and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier integrity. Due to intrinsic complexity of microglia and up until recently lack of specific markers, the study of microglial response to bacterial pathogens is challenging. New experimental models and techniques open up possibilities to accelerate progress in the field. We review existing models and discuss possibilities and limitations. Finally, we summarize recent findings where bacterial virulence factors are identified to be important for the microglial response, and how manipulation of evoked responses could be used for therapeutic or preventive purposes. Among promising approaches are: modulations of microglia phenotype switching toward anti-inflammatory and phagocytic functions, the use of non-bacterolytic antimicrobials, preventing release of bacterial components into the neural milieu and consequential amplification of immune activation, and protection of the blood-brain barrier integrity.","Thorsdottir, Sigrun; Henriques-Normark, Birgitta; Iovino, Federico",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6442515/,12
3747,An OpenMP-based tool for finding longest common subsequence in bioinformatics,2019-04-11,"OBJECTIVE: Finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) among sequences is NP-hard. This is an important problem in bioinformatics for DNA sequence alignment and pattern discovery. In this research, we propose new CPU-based parallel implementations that can provide significant advantages in terms of execution times, monetary cost, and pervasiveness in finding LCS of DNA sequences in an environment where Graphics Processing Units are not available. For general purpose use, we also make the OpenMP-based tool publicly available to end users. RESULT: In this study, we develop three novel parallel versions of the LCS algorithm on: (i) distributed memory machine using message passing interface (MPI); (ii) shared memory machine using OpenMP, and (iii) hybrid platform that utilizes both distributed and shared memory using MPI-OpenMP. The experimental results with both simulated and real DNA sequence data show that the shared memory OpenMP implementation provides at least two-times absolute speedup than the best sequential version of the algorithm and a relative speedup of almost 7. We provide a detailed comparison of the execution times among the implementations on different platforms with different versions of the algorithm. We also show that removing branch conditions negatively affects the performance of the CPU-based parallel algorithm on OpenMP platform.","Shikder, Rayhan; Thulasiraman, Parimala; Irani, Pourang; Hu, Pingzhao",BMC Res Notes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6458724/,12

In this study, the anti-herpetic and anti-dengue evaluation of 27 terpenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ), 1,4-anthraquinone (AQ) and heterocycle-fused quinone (HetQ) derivatives was done in vitro against Human Herpesvirus (HHV) type 1 and 2, and Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). The cytotoxicity on HeLa and Jurkat tumor cell lines was also tested. Using plaque forming unit assays, cell viability assays and molecular docking, we found that NQ 4 was the best antiviral compound, while AQ 11 was the most active and selective molecule on the tested tumor cells. NQ 4 showed a fair antiviral activity against Herpesviruses (EC(50): <0.4 µg/mL, <1.28 µM) and DENV-2 (1.6 µg/mL, 5.1 µM) on pre-infective stages. Additionally, NQ 4 disrupted the viral attachment of HHV-1 to Vero cells (EC(50): 0.12 µg/mL, 0.38 µM) with a very high selectivity index (SI = 1728). The in silico analysis predicted that this quinone could bind to the prefusion form of the E glycoprotein of DENV-2. These findings demonstrate that NQ 4 is a potent and highly selective antiviral compound, while suggesting its ability to prevent Herpes and Dengue infections. Additionally, AQ 11 can be considered of interest as a leader for the design of new anticancer agents.","Roa-Linares, Vicky C.; Miranda-Brand, Yaneth; Tangarife-Castaño, Verónica; Ochoa, Rodrigo; García, Pablo A.; Castro, Mª Ángeles; Betancur-Galvis, Liliana; San Feliciano, Arturo",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6479402/,12
3856,"Acute Phase Proteins in Marine Mammals: State of Art, Perspectives and Challenges",2019-05-29,"The term “acute phase response” (APR) is referred to a nonspecific and complex reaction of an organism that occurs shortly after any tissue damage, such as infection, trauma, neoplasia, inflammation, and stress. The APR can be identified and monitored with some laboratory tests, such as the concentration of several plasma proteins, the acute phase proteins (APPs). The APPs are components of the non-specific innate immune response, and their plasma concentration is proportional to the severity and/or the extent of tissue damage. The evaluation of health status of marine mammals is difficult because the classical clinical signs of illness used for human and domestic animals are difficult to recognize and understand. For this reason, in the past years, several efforts were done to identify laboratory markers of disease in these animals. The APPs have demonstrated their role as early markers of inflammation in veterinary medicine, thus several APPs were tested in marine mammals, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid-A (SAA), and Haptoglobin (Hp). However, the difficulty to extrapolate the knowledge about APPs in one species to another, the lack of specie-specific reagents, the absence of data about negative APPs have hampered their extent use in marine mammals. Herein, the state of art of APPs in marine mammals is reviewed, with particular attention to pre-analytical and analytical factors that should be taken into account in validation and interpretation of APPs assays. Moreover, the current application, potential utility and the future developments of APPs in marine mammals is highlighted and discussed.","Gelain, Maria Elena; Bonsembiante, Federico",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6549532/,12
3892,Protective effects of the Francisella tularensis ΔpdpC mutant against its virulent parental strain SCHU P9 in Cynomolgus macaques,2019-06-24,"Tularemia is a severe infectious zoonotic disease caused by Francisella tularensis. Although F. tularensis is considered to be a potential biological weapon due to its high infectivity and mortality rate, no vaccine has been currently licensed. Recently, we reported that F. tularensis SCHU P9 derived ΔpdpC strain lacking the pathogenicity determinant protein C gene conferred stable and good protection in a mouse lethal model. In this study, the protective effect of ΔpdpC was evaluated using a monkey lethal model. Two cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) intratracheally challenged with the virulent strain SCHU P9 were euthanized on 7 and 11 days post-challenge after the development of severe clinical signs. The bacterial replication in alveolar macrophages and type II epithelial cells in the lungs would cause severe pneumonia accompanied by necrosis. Conversely, two animals subcutaneously immunized with ΔpdpC survived 3 weeks after SCHU P9 challenge. Though one of the two animals developed mild symptoms of tularemia, bacterial replication was limited in the respiratory organs, which may be due to a high level of humoral and cellular immune responses against F. tularensis. These results suggest that the ΔpdpC mutant would be a safe and promising candidate as a live attenuated tularemia vaccine.","Tian, Deyu; Uda, Akihiko; Ami, Yasushi; Hotta, Akitoyo; Park, Eun-sil; Nagata, Noriyo; Iwata-Yoshikawa, Naoko; Yamada, Akio; Hirayama, Kazuhiro; Miura, Kozue; Koyama, Yuki; Azaki, Mika; Morikawa, Shigeru",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6591246/,12
3937,Current and Novel Approaches in Influenza Management,2019-06-18,"Influenza is a disease that poses a significant health burden worldwide. Vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza virus infections. However, conventional vaccines are only effective for a short period of time due to the propensity of influenza viruses to undergo antigenic drift and antigenic shift. The efficacy of these vaccines is uncertain from year-to-year due to potential mismatch between the circulating viruses and vaccine strains, and mutations arising due to egg adaptation. Subsequently, the inability to store these vaccines long-term and vaccine shortages are challenges that need to be overcome. Conventional vaccines also have variable efficacies for certain populations, including the young, old, and immunocompromised. This warrants for diverse efficacious vaccine developmental approaches, involving both active and passive immunization. As opposed to active immunization platforms (requiring the use of whole or portions of pathogens as vaccines), the rapidly developing passive immunization involves administration of either pathogen-specific or broadly acting antibodies against a kind or class of pathogens as a treatment to corresponding acute infection. Several antibodies with broadly acting capacities have been discovered that may serve as means to suppress influenza viral infection and allow the process of natural immunity to engage opsonized pathogens whilst boosting immune system by antibody-dependent mechanisms that bridge the innate and adaptive arms. By that; passive immunotherapeutics approach assumes a robust tool that could aid control of influenza viruses. In this review, we comment on some improvements in influenza management and promising vaccine development platforms with an emphasis on the protective capacity of passive immunotherapeutics especially when coupled with the use of antivirals in the management of influenza infection.","Kotey, Erasmus; Lukosaityte, Deimante; Quaye, Osbourne; Ampofo, William; Awandare, Gordon; Iqbal, Munir",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6630949/,12
3987,Antioxidant Defence Systems and Oxidative Stress in Poultry Biology: An Update,2019-07-22,"Poultry in commercial settings are exposed to a range of stressors. A growing body of information clearly indicates that excess ROS/RNS production and oxidative stress are major detrimental consequences of the most common commercial stressors in poultry production. During evolution, antioxidant defence systems were developed in poultry to survive in an oxygenated atmosphere. They include a complex network of internally synthesised (e.g., antioxidant enzymes, (glutathione) GSH, (coenzyme Q) CoQ) and externally supplied (vitamin E, carotenoids, etc.) antioxidants. In fact, all antioxidants in the body work cooperatively as a team to maintain optimal redox balance in the cell/body. This balance is a key element in providing the necessary conditions for cell signalling, a vital process for regulation of the expression of various genes, stress adaptation and homeostasis maintenance in the body. Since ROS/RNS are considered to be important signalling molecules, their concentration is strictly regulated by the antioxidant defence network in conjunction with various transcription factors and vitagenes. In fact, activation of vitagenes via such transcription factors as Nrf2 leads to an additional synthesis of an array of protective molecules which can deal with increased ROS/RNS production. Therefore, it is a challenging task to develop a system of optimal antioxidant supplementation to help growing/productive birds maintain effective antioxidant defences and redox balance in the body. On the one hand, antioxidants, such as vitamin E, or minerals (e.g., Se, Mn, Cu and Zn) are a compulsory part of the commercial pre-mixes for poultry, and, in most cases, are adequate to meet the physiological requirements in these elements. On the other hand, due to the aforementioned commercially relevant stressors, there is a need for additional support for the antioxidant system in poultry. This new direction in improving antioxidant defences for poultry in stress conditions is related to an opportunity to activate a range of vitagenes (via Nrf2-related mechanisms: superoxide dismutase, SOD; heme oxygenase-1, HO-1; GSH and thioredoxin, or other mechanisms: Heat shock protein (HSP)/heat shock factor (HSP), sirtuins, etc.) to maximise internal AO protection and redox balance maintenance. Therefore, the development of vitagene-regulating nutritional supplements is on the agenda of many commercial companies worldwide.","Surai, Peter F.; Kochish, Ivan I.; Fisinin, Vladimir I.; Kidd, Michael T.",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6680731/,12
4034,Mannose-Specific Lectins from Marine Algae: Diverse Structural Scaffolds Associated to Common Virucidal and Anti-Cancer Properties,2019-07-26,"To date, a number of mannose-specific lectins have been isolated and characterized from seaweeds, especially from red algae. In fact, man-specific seaweed lectins consist of different structural scaffolds harboring a single or a few carbohydrate-binding sites which specifically recognize mannose-containing glycans. Depending on the structural scaffold, man-specific seaweed lectins belong to five distinct structurally-related lectin families, namely (1) the griffithsin lectin family (β-prism I scaffold); (2) the Oscillatoria agardhii agglutinin homolog (OAAH) lectin family (β-barrel scaffold); (3) the legume lectin-like lectin family (β-sandwich scaffold); (4) the Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA)-like lectin family (β-prism II scaffold); and, (5) the MFP2-like lectin family (MFP2-like scaffold). Another algal lectin from Ulva pertusa, has been inferred to the methanol dehydrogenase related lectin family, because it displays a rather different GlcNAc-specificity. In spite of these structural discrepancies, all members from the five lectin families share a common ability to specifically recognize man-containing glycans and, especially, high-mannose type glycans. Because of their mannose-binding specificity, these lectins have been used as valuable tools for deciphering and characterizing the complex mannose-containing glycans from the glycocalyx covering both normal and transformed cells, and as diagnostic tools and therapeutic drugs that specifically recognize the altered high-mannose N-glycans occurring at the surface of various cancer cells. In addition to these anti-cancer properties, man-specific seaweed lectins have been widely used as potent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)-inactivating proteins, due to their capacity to specifically interact with the envelope glycoprotein gp120 and prevent the virion infectivity of HIV-1 towards the host CD4+ T-lymphocyte cells in vitro.","Barre, Annick; Simplicien, Mathias; Benoist, Hervé; Van Damme, Els J.M.; Rougé, Pierre",Mar Drugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723950/,12
4237,Effect of thermal control of dry fomites on regulating the survival of human pathogenic bacteria responsible for nosocomial infections,2019-12-27,"We monitored the survival of human pathogenic bacteria [Escherichia coli (ATCC), extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing E. coli (Clinical isolate), New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-producing E. coli (clinical isolate), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC)] on dry materials (vinyl chloride, aluminum, plastic, stainless steel) at distinct temperatures (room temperature or 15°C–37°C). These bacteria favored a lower temperature for their prolonged survival on the dry fomites, regardless of the material type. Interestingly, when mixed with S. aureus, E. coli survived for a longer time at a lower temperature. Cardiolipin, which can promote the survival of S. aureus in harsh environments, had no effect on maintaining the survival of E. coli. Although the trends remained unchanged, adjusting the humidity from 40% to 60% affected the survival of bacteria on dry surfaces. Scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed no morphological differences in these bacteria immediately before or after one day of dry conditions. In addition, ATP assessment, a method used to visualize high-touch surfaces in hospitals, was not effective at monitoring bacterial dynamics. A specialized handrail device fitted with a heater, which was maintained at normal human body core temperature, successfully prohibited the prolonged survival of bacteria [Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC), E. coli (ATCC), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC), S. aureus (ATCC), Acinetobacter baumannii (clinical isolate), and Serratia marcescens (clinical isolate)], with the exception of spore-forming Bacillus subtilis (from our laboratory collection) and the yeast-like fungus Candida albicans (from our laboratory collection)] on dry surfaces. Taken together, we concluded that the tested bacteria favor lower temperatures for their survival in dry environments. Therefore, the thermal control of dry fomites has the potential to control bacterial survival on high-touch surfaces in hospitals.","Shimoda, Tomoko; Okubo, Torahiko; Enoeda, Yoshiki; Yano, Rika; Nakamura, Shinji; Thapa, Jeewan; Yamaguchi, Hiroyuki",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6934310/,12

In this study, we demonstrate synchronized biventricular (BiV) pacing in a leadless fashion by implementing miniaturized and wirelessly powered pacemakers. With their flexible form factors, two pacemakers were implanted epicardially on the right and left ventricles of a porcine model and were inductively powered at 13.56 MHz and 40.68 MHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands, respectively. The power consumption of these pacemakers is reduced to µW-level by a novel integrated circuit design, which considerably extends the maximum operating distance. Leadless BiV pacing is demonstrated for the first time in both open-chest and closed-chest porcine settings. The clinical outcomes associated with different interventricular delays are verified through electrophysiologic and hemodynamic responses. The closed-chest pacing only requires the external source power of 0.3 W and 0.8 W at 13.56 MHz and 40.68 MHz, respectively, which leads to specific absorption rates (SARs) 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than the safety regulation limit.

Influenza A group 1 HA stem-nanoparticles have been demonstrated to confer heterosubtypic protection in animals; however, the protection does not extend to group 2 viruses, due in part to differences in glycosylation between group 1 and 2 stems. Here, we show that introducing the group 2 glycan at Asn38(HA1) to a group 1 stem-nanoparticle (gN38 variant) based on A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) broadens antibody responses to cross-react with group 2 HAs. Immunoglobulins elicited by the gN38 variant provide complete protection against group 2 H7N9 virus infection, while the variant loses protection against a group 1 H5N1 virus. The N38(HA1) glycan thus is pivotal in directing antibody responses by controlling access to group-determining stem epitopes.

The consequences on pathogen-specific immune responses are not well known. This study evaluated and compared the humoral responses specific to merozoite stage vaccine candidates of Plasmodium falciparum, in children differentially exposed to Anopheles bites in a natural setting. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was carried out in Bouaké (Côte d’Ivoire) where entomological data and blood samples from children (0–14 years) were collected in two sites with similar malaria prevalence. Antibody (IgG, IgG1, IgG3) responses to PfAMA1 and PfMSP1 were evaluated by ELISA. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to assess the relationship between the immune responses to P. falciparum antigens and exposure to Anopheles bites in the total cohort and in each site, separately. The individual level of exposure to Anopheles bites was evaluated by quantifying specific IgG response to the Anopheles gSG6-P1 salivary peptide, which represents a proxy of Anopheles exposure. RESULTS: The anti-Plasmodium humoral responses were different according to the level of exposure of children, with those highly exposed to Anopheles presenting significantly lower antibody responses to PfMSP1 in total population (IgG and IgG3) and in Petessou village (IgG, IgG1, IgG3). No significant difference was seen for PfAMA1 antigen between children differently exposed to Anopheles. In Dar-es-Salam, a neighbourhood where a high Culex density was reported, children presented very low antibody levels specific to both antigens, and no difference according to the exposure to Anopheles bites was found. CONCLUSION: These findings may suggest that immunomodulatory components of Anopheles saliva, in addition to other factors, may participate to the modulation of the humoral response specific to Plasmodium merozoite stage antigens. This epidemiological observation may form a starting point for additional work to decipher the role of mosquito saliva on the modulation of the anti-Plasmodium acquired immunity and clinical protection in combining both field and ex vivo immunological studies.","Aka, Kakou G.; Traoré, Dipomin F.; Sagna, André B.; Zoh, Dounin D.; Assi, Serge B.; Tchiekoi, Bertin N’cho; Adja, Akré M.; Remoue, Franck; Poinsignon, Anne",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033907/,12

This systematic review and meta-analysis included six randomized controlled trials and a prospective study identified in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science until August 18, 2019. In this meta-analysis including 956 participants, HFNC was noninferior to standard of care during endotracheal intubation regarding incidence of severe hypoxemia, mean lowest oxygen saturation, and in-hospital mortality. HFNC significantly shortened the ICU stay by a mean of 1.8 days. In linear meta-regression interaction analysis, the risk ratio of severe hypoxemia decreased with increasing baseline partial oxygen pressure (PaO(2)) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) ratio. In subgroup analysis, HFNC significantly reduced the incidence of severe hypoxemia during endotracheal intubation in patients with mild hypoxemia (PaO(2)/FiO(2)> 200 mmHg; risk difference, −0.06; 95% confidence interval, −0.12 to −0.01; number needed to treat = 16.7).

4781,A branching model for the spread of infectious animal diseases in varying environments,2004-03-03,"ABSTRACT: Quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) parameters are good indicators for the reactivity of direct-acting antiviral drugs. Since molecular structure is related to molecular function, careful selection of molecular substitutions will result in more drugs that are potent. In this work, QSAR parameters are selected in order to compare the four drugs used as nucleotide inhibitors (NIs) for non-structural 5B (NS5B) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of hepatitis C virus (HCV). These drugs are: ribavirin (widely used over the last 20 years), sofosbuvir (approved on December 2013 by FDA), and finally IDX-184 and R7128 (phase IIb of clinical trial drugs). The nucleotide analogues uracil (U), guanine (G), and cytosine (C) from which these drugs are fabricated are also compared to that group of drugs. QSAR parameters suggested that the drug IDX-184 is the best among all of the studied NIs. It also shows that NIs are always more reactive than their parent nucleotide.

5077,On the role of peripheral macrophages during active experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE),2001,"Many of the most virulent emerging infectious diseases in humans, e.g., AIDS and Ebola, are zoonotic, having shifted from wildlife populations. Critical questions for predicting disease emergence are: (1) what determines when and where a disease will first cross from one species to another, and (2) which factors facilitate emergence after a successful host shift. In wild primates, infectious diseases most often are shared between species that are closely related and inhabit the same geographic region. Therefore, humans may be most vulnerable to diseases from the great apes, which include chimpanzees and gorillas, because these species represent our closest relatives. Geographic overlap may provide the opportunity for cross-species transmission, but successful infection and establishment will be determined by the biology of both the host and pathogen. We extrapolate the evolutionary relationship between pathogen sharing and divergence time between primate species to generate “hotspot” maps, highlighting regions where the risk of disease transfer between wild primates and from wild primates to humans is greatest. We find that central Africa and Amazonia are hotspots for cross-species transmission events between wild primates, due to a high diversity of closely related primate species. Hotspots of host shifts to humans will be most likely in the forests of central and west Africa, where humans come into frequent contact with their wild primate relatives. These areas also are likely to sustain a novel epidemic due to their rapidly growing human populations, close proximity to apes, and population centers with high density and contact rates among individuals.","Pedersen, Amy B.; Davies, T.

5442,On the Role of Asymptomatic Infection in Transmission Dynamics of Infectious Diseases,2007-08-15,"Despite the importance of buffalo farming in Iran, little is known in this country about the abundance and distribution of Eimeria spp. in the animal species. The present study was designed to investigate the prevalence and species characterization of Eimeria oocysts in river buffalo calves of Khuzestan province, southwest of Iran. Of the total 108 fecal samples examined for Eimeria, 108 (100%) were found infected with 11 species of the parasite. Among the identified species of Eimeria, E. bovis was found to be the predominant etiological agent (76.85%), followed in order by E. canadensis (62.96%), E. zuernii (47.2%), E. ellipsoidalis (26.85%), E. subspherica (25.92%), E. brasiliensis (19.4%), E. auburnensis (18.51%), E. alabamensis (14.81%), E. pellita (11.1%), E. illinoisensis (5.5%) and E. bukidnonensis (2.7%). In most calves multiple infections with three species were present. While, 20.7% of calves showed heavy infection, 50.4 and 24.8% of calves showed weak and moderate infection, respectively. There was no significant difference in the OPG values between the calves of different localities. There was also no significant difference between the prevalence rate of infection in males and females. A total of 16.6% of all faecal samples were found to be diarrheic. A highly significant relationship could be identified between the occurrence of diarrhea and the level of E. bovis and E. zuernii oocysts excretion. Considering the pervasive occurrence and negative effects of the infection on the health condition and the growth performance of buffalo calves, infections should receive increased attention by both farmers and veterinarians.","Bahrami, Somayeh; Alborzi, Ali Reza",Acta Parasitol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089378/,12

In the current study, sodium pentaborate pentahydrate and triclosan are applied to cotton fabrics in order to gain antimicrobial and antiviral properties for the first time. The antimicrobial activity of textiles treated with 3 % sodium pentaborate pentahydrate, 0.03 % triclosan, and 7 % Glucapon has been investigated against a broad range of microorganisms including bacteria, yeast, and fungi. Moreover, modified cotton fabrics were tested against adenovirus type 5 and poliovirus type 1. According to the test results, the modified textile goods attained very good antimicrobial and antiviral properties. Thus, the results of the present study clearly suggest that sodium pentaborate pentahydrate and triclosan solution-treated textiles can be considered in the development of antimicrobial and antiviral textile finishes.","Iyigundogdu, Zeynep Ustaoglu; Demir, Okan; Asutay, Ayla Burcin; Sahin, Fikrettin",Appl Biochem Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091037/,12

Prophylactic transfusions for asymptomatic patients should be considered if platelet count is below 20000/μl. However, if bleeding occurs or surgery is inevitable, platelet count should be maintained above 50000/μl. The benefit of platelet transfusions has to be balanced against risks like fever, infections and haemolysis. The effectiveness of platelet transfusions should be examined after 1 and 24 hrs by measuring the corrected count increment (CCI). Not only alloimmunization is a reason for unsatisfactory platelet increments. A poor CCI can also be due to fever, sepsis, hepato-splenomegaly or special drugs, which must be taken into account when assessing the demand for platelet transfusions.","Söhngen, D.; Schneider, W.",Klin Wochenschr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095859/,12

Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition. The model undergoes backward bifurcation if the antiviral drugs are completely efficient. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is presented to identify and study the impact of critical model parameters on the reproduction number. A time dependent optimal treatment strategy is designed using Pontryagin’s maximum principle to minimize the treatment cost and the infected population.

6426,Antimicrobial Agents are Societal Drugs: How Should This Influence Prescribing?,2012-09-17,"Viruses are ubiquitous and cause numerous infections in humans. These may vary from asymptomatic infection to severe debilitating illness. Viruses enter the host cells to replicate, using host synthetic mechanisms, and, thus, are resistant to conventional antibiotics. The human body responds to viral infection by synthesising specific antibody which can be used to aid diagnosis. Infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) commonly affects the 15 to 30 years age group. It may produce severe debility which may last a month or more. Coxsackie virus infection can produce symptoms of the common cold but may also invade heart muscle and produce myocarditis, a potentially serious disease. Other viruses also produce a wide spectrum of disease. Recent evidence has shown that people undergoing severe mental or physical stress may have reduced immunity to viral infections. There are risks associated with strenuous physical activity during the acute phase of viral infection, and there are reports of sudden death and serious complications occurring in previously fit young adults who undertake vigorous exercise when in the acute phase of a viral illness. Abnormalities of skeletal muscle have been demonstrated in patients with viral infection and this may explain the loss of performance experienced by athletes after upper respiratory tract infection. As a general rule, for all but mild common colds, it is advised that the athlete avoids hard training for the first month after infection.","Roberts, J.

RESULTS: Seventy subjects with UC (mean age 13 years, 45 had moderate symptoms, 25 had severe, 69 of 70 had a Mayo endoscopy subscore 2/3) were studied. We detected a wide range of animal viruses that were taxonomically classified into 12 viral families. A virus was present in 50% of fecal samples collected at presentation, 41% of samples collected after remission, and 40% of samples in our control group. The most frequently identified viruses were diet-based gyroviruses. The UC cohort had a significantly higher prevalence of anelloviruses compared with the control cohort.

In this chapter, an in-depth analysis of these similarities and differences is provided to allow researchers to use mouse models of human disease and primary cells derived from these animal models under the most appropriate and meaningful conditions. Although there are considerable differences between mice and humans, particularly regarding genetics, physiology, and immunology, a more thorough understanding of these differences and their effects on the function of the whole organism will provide deeper insights into relevant disease mechanisms and potential drug targets for further clinical investigation. Using specific examples of mouse models of human lung disease, i.e., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary fibrosis, this chapter explores the most salient features of mouse models of human disease and provides a full assessment of the advantages and limitations of these models, focusing on the relevance of disease induction and their ability to replicate critical features of human disease pathophysiology and response to treatment.

In Africa, gorillas and chimpanzees have succumbed for years to simultaneous epizootics (i.e.. “multi-emergence”) of Ebola virus in places where they are in contact with Chiropters, which could be animal reservoirs of these viruses. Human epidemics often follow these major outbreaks. Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) have an ancient history of coevolution and many interspecific exchanges with their natural hosts. Chimpanzee and gorilla SIVs have crossed the species barrier at different times and places, leading to the emergence of HIV-1 and HIV-2. Other retroviruses, such as the Simian T-Lymphotropic Viruses and Foamiviruses, have also a unique ancient or recent history of crossing the species barrier. The identification of gorilla Plasmodium parasites that are genetically close to P. falciparum suggests that gorillas were the source of the deadly human P. falciparum.

In the present chapter, we review how NAbs may interfere with the cytokine network and how NAbs, through formation of complement-activating immune complexes with soluble self-antigens, may promote the uptake and presentation of self-molecules by antigen-presenting cells. Both naturally occurring and disease-associated autoantibodies against a variety of cytokines have been reported, including NAbs against interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, macrophage chemotactic protein-1 and IL-21. NAbs against a variety of other self-antigens have also been reported, and using thyroglobulin as an example we discuss how NAbs are capable of promoting uptake of immune complexes via complement receptors and Fc-receptors on antigen-presenting cells and thereby regulate T-cell activity. Knowledge of the influence of NAbs against cytokines on immune homeostasis is likely to have wide-ranging implications both in understanding pathogenesis and in treatment of many immunoinflammatory disorders, including a number of autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases.","Nielsen, Claus H.; Bendtzen, Klaus",Naturally Occurring Antibodies (NAbs),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123141/,12

9590,Chromosome Mapping of Connective Tissue Protein Genes,2013-11-17,"Modified mRNA (modRNA) is a gene-delivery platform for transiently introducing a single gene or several genes of interest to different cell types and tissues. modRNA is considered to be a safe vector for gene transfer, as it negligibly activates the innate immune system and does not compromise the genome integrity. The use of modRNA in basic and translational science is rising, due to the clinical potential of modRNA. We are currently using modRNA to induce cardiac regeneration post-ischemic injury. Major obstacles in using modRNA for cardiac ischemic disease include the need for the direct and single administration of modRNA to the heart and the inefficient translation of modRNA due to its short half-life. Modulation of the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) to enhance translation efficiency in ischemic cardiac disease has great value, as it can reduce the amount of modRNA needed per delivery and will achieve higher and longer protein production post-single delivery. Here, we identified that 5′ UTR, from the fatty acid metabolism gene carboxylesterase 1D (Ces1d), enhanced the translation of firefly luciferase (Luc) modRNA by 2-fold in the heart post-myocardial infarction (MI). Moreover, we identified, in the Ces1d, a specific RNA element (element D) that is responsible for the improvement of modRNA translation and leads to a 2.5-fold translation increment over Luc modRNA carrying artificial 5′ UTR, post-MI. Importantly, we were able to show that 5′ UTR Ces1d also enhances modRNA translation in the liver, but not in the kidney, post-ischemic injury, indicating that Ces1d 5′ UTR and element D may play a wider role in translation of protein under an ischemic condition.","Sultana, Nishat; Hadas, Yoav; Sharkar, Mohammad Tofael Kabir; Kaur, Keerat; Magadum, Ajit; Kurian, Ann Anu; Hossain, Nadia; Alburquerque, Bremy; Ahmed, Sakib; Chepurko, Elena; Zangi, Lior",Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150433/,12

Here, water‐soluble lipid‐polymer probes are synthesized harboring hydrophilic or hydrophobic far‐red emitting dyes, and exhibiting enhanced brightness. They efficiently label Hepatitis C Virus pseudotyped particles (HCVpp), more stably and reproducibly than commercial probes, and a strong fluorescence signal is observed with a high contrast. Labeling with such probes do not alter virion morphology, integrity, nor infectivity. Finally, it is shown by fluorescence microscopy that these probes enable efficient tracking of labeled HCVpp inside hepatocarcinoma cells used as model hepatocytes, in spite of their autofluorescence up to 700 nm.

Bacteriophages (or phages) are often used to model the behavior of pathogenic human viruses as they are similar in size, structure and behavior. This study investigated the removal of phages MS‐2 (25 nm) and T4 (200 nm) in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) with a membrane pore size of 0.4 µm. RESULTS: The membrane reactor without biomass was assessed and its log removal was 0.7 ± 0.4 log for the MS‐2 phage, and 2.3 ± 0.2 log for the T4. When anaerobic biomass was added to the reactor the log removal for both phages increased, and this was thought to be due to a complex relationship with the biofilm on the membrane. CONCLUSIONS: Overall MS‐2 rejections ranged from 1.75 up to 5.5 log, with the highest rejections observed at the highest sparging rates after extensive fouling had occurred.

The epidemiology of infection with the influenza A and B, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial viruses and adenoviruses and their impact on infants and children and the groups at highest risk for morbid outcomes are discussed.

10624,Vitamin B and Vitamin C Affect DNA Methylation and Amino Acid Metabolism in Mycobacterium bovis BCG,2020-04-22,"In critical illness, homeostatic corrections representing the culmination of hundreds of millions of years of evolution, are modulated by the activated glucocorticoid receptor alpha (GRα) and are associated with an enormous bioenergetic and metabolic cost. Appreciation of how homeostatic corrections work and how they evolved provides a conceptual framework to understand the complex pathobiology of critical illness. Emerging literature place the activated GRα at the center of all phases of disease development and resolution, including activation and re-enforcement of innate immunity, downregulation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors, and restoration of anatomy and function. By the time critically ill patients necessitate vital organ support for survival, they have reached near exhaustion or exhaustion of neuroendocrine homeostatic compensation, cell bio-energetic and adaptation functions, and reserves of vital micronutrients. We review how critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency, mitochondrial dysfunction/damage, and hypovitaminosis collectively interact to accelerate an anti-homeostatic active process of natural selection. Importantly, the allostatic overload imposed by these homeostatic corrections impacts negatively on both acute and long-term morbidity and mortality. Since the bioenergetic and metabolic reserves to support homeostatic corrections are time-limited, early interventions should be directed at increasing GRα and mitochondria number and function. Present understanding of the activated GC-GRα's role in immunomodulation and disease resolution should be taken into account when re-evaluating how to administer glucocorticoid treatment and co-interventions to improve cellular responsiveness. The activated GRα interdependence with functional mitochondria and three vitamin reserves (B1, C, and D) provides a rationale for co-interventions that include prolonged glucocorticoid treatment in association with rapid correction of hypovitaminosis.","Meduri, Gianfranco Umberto; Chrousos, George P.",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189617/,12
11142,Neonatal Organ and Tissue Donation for Research: Options Following Death by Natural Causes,2020-03-13,"Vibrio harveyi, which belongs to family Vibrionaceae of class Gammaproteobacteria, includes the species V. carchariae and V. trachuri as its junior synonyms. The organism is a well-recognized and serious bacterial pathogen of marine fish and invertebrates, including penaeid shrimp, in aquaculture. Diseased fish may exhibit a range of lesions, including eye lesions/blindness, gastro-enteritis, muscle necrosis, skin ulcers, and tail rot disease. In shrimp, V. harveyi is regarded as the etiological agent of luminous vibriosis in which affected animals glow in the dark. There is a second condition of shrimp known as Bolitas negricans where the digestive tract is filled with spheres of sloughed-off tissue. It is recognized that the pathogenicity mechanisms of V. harveyi may be different in fish and penaeid shrimp. In shrimp, the pathogenicity mechanisms involved the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, and extracellular proteases, and interaction with bacteriophages. In fish, the pathogenicity mechanisms involved extracellular hemolysin (encoded by duplicate hemolysin genes), which was identified as a phospholipase B and could inactivate fish cells by apoptosis, via the caspase activation pathway. V. harveyi may enter the so-called viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state, and resuscitation of the VBNC cells may be an important reason for vibriosis outbreaks in aquaculture. Disease control measures center on dietary supplements (including probiotics), nonspecific immunostimulants, and vaccines and to a lesser extent antibiotics and other antimicrobial compounds.","Zhang, Xiao-Hua; He, Xinxin; Austin, Brian",Mar Life Sci Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223180/,12

In recent years, the accelerated pace of genomic data availability has been accompanied by the application of a wide array of highly efficient approaches from other fields to the field of metagenomics. For instance, sketching algorithms such as MinHash have seen a rapid and widespread adoption. These techniques handle increasingly large datasets with minimal sacrifices in quality for tasks such as sequence similarity calculations. Here, we briefly review the fundamentals of the most impactful probabilistic and signal processing algorithms. We also highlight more recent advances to augment previous reviews in these areas that have taken a broader approach. We then explore the application of these techniques to metagenomics, discuss their pros and cons, and speculate on their future directions.","Elworth, R A Leo; Wang, Qi; Kota, Pavan K; Barberan, C J; Coleman, Benjamin; Balaji, Advait; Gupta, Gaurav; Baraniuk, Richard G; Shrivastava, Anshumali; Treangen, Todd J",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7261164/,12

Although this pathogen was only discovered in 2001, an enormous amount of research has been conducted in order to develop safe and effective vaccines to prevent people from contracting the disease. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the most promising experimental B- and T-cell epitopes of human metapneumovirus for the rational design of HMPV vaccines using vector delivery systems, paying special attention to the conservation of these epitopes among different lineages/genotypes of HMPV. The prospects of the successful development of an epitope-based HMPV vaccine are discussed in the context of recent findings regarding HMPV’s ability to modulate host immunity. In particular, we discuss the lack of data on experimental human CD4 T-cell epitopes for HMPV despite the role of CD4 lymphocytes in both the induction of higher neutralizing antibody titers and the establishment of CD8 memory T-cell responses. We conclude that current research should be focused on searching for human CD4 T-cell epitopes of HMPV that can help us to design a safe and cross-protective epitope-based HMPV vaccine.","Stepanova, Ekaterina; Matyushenko, Victoria; Rudenko, Larisa; Isakova-Sivak, Irina",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7350342/,12

However, there is a gap in the knowledge about the mechanisms that regulate the expression of such host factors. Here, we aimed to assess DNA methylation impact on host genome in natural HIV-1 control. To this end, whole DNA methylome in 70 untreated HIV-1 infected individuals with either high (>50,000 HIV-1-RNA copies/ml, n = 29) or low (<10,000 HIV-1-RNA copies/ml, n = 41) plasma viral load (pVL) levels were compared and identified 2,649 differentially methylated positions (DMPs). Of these, a classification random forest model selected 55 DMPs that correlated with virologic (pVL and proviral levels) and HIV-1 specific adaptive immunity parameters (IFNg-T cell responses and neutralizing antibodies capacity). Then, cluster and functional analyses identified two DMP clusters: cluster 1 contained hypo-methylated genes involved in antiviral and interferon response (e.g. PARP9, MX1, and USP18) in individuals with high viral loads while in cluster 2, genes related to T follicular helper cell (Tfh) commitment (e.g. CXCR5 and TCF7) were hyper-methylated in the same group of individuals with uncontrolled infection. For selected genes, mRNA levels negatively correlated with DNA methylation, confirming an epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Further, these gene expression signatures were also confirmed in early and chronic stages of infection, including untreated, cART treated and elite controllers HIV-1 infected individuals (n = 37). These data provide the first evidence that host genes critically involved in immune control of the virus are under methylation regulation in HIV-1 infection. These insights may offer new opportunities to identify novel mechanisms of in vivo virus control and may prove crucial for the development of future therapeutic interventions aimed at HIV-1 cure.","Oriol-Tordera, Bruna; Berdasco, Maria; Llano, Anuska; Mothe, Beatriz; Gálvez, Cristina; Martinez-Picado, Javier; Carrillo, Jorge; Blanco, Julià; Duran-Castells, Clara; Ganoza, Carmela; Sanchez, Jorge; Clotet, Bonaventura; Calle, Maria Luz; Sánchez-Pla, Alex; Esteller, Manel; Brander, Christian; Ruiz-Riol, Marta",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7410168/,12
12616,From subordination to complementarity?,2020-08-12,"BACKGROUND: World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that viral load ([VL) is a primary tool that clinicians and researchers have used to monitor patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), an antiviral drug against retroviruses. Whereas, CD4 cell counts can only be used to monitor clinical response to ART in the absence of VL testing service. Therefore, this study is aimed to assess the level of immunological status and virological suppression, and identify associated factors among human immunodeficiency virus ([HIV)-infected adults who were taking antiretroviral drugs of combination regimen know as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted at the University of Gondar comprehensive specialized referral hospital from February to April 2018. A total of 323 adult participants on HAART were selected using a systematic random sampling technique and enrolled into the study. Blood samples for viral load determination and CD4 cell count were collected. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with immunologic status and virological suppression in HIV patients on HAART. Odds ratio with 95% CI was used to measure the strength of association. RESULTS: Virological suppression (VL level < 1000 copies/ml) was found in 82% (95% CI 77.7, 86.1) of study participants, and it has been associated with CD4 cell count between 350 and 499 cells/mm(3) (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.56; 95% CI 1.14, 5.75) and > 499 cells/mm(3) (AOR = 7.71; 95% CI 3.48, 17.09) at VL testing and current age > 45 years old (AOR = 5.99; 95% CI 2.12, 16.91). Similarly, favorable immunological status (≥ 400 cells/mm(3) for male and ≥ 466 cells/mm(3) for female) was observed in 52.9% (95% CI 47.4, 58.8) of the study participants. Baseline CD4 cell count of > 200 cells/mm(3), age at enrollment of 26 through 40 years old, and urban residence were significantly associated with favorable immunological status. CONCLUSION: Though the majority of HIV-infected adults who were on HAART had shown viral suppression, the rate of suppression was sub-optimal according to the UNAIDS 90-90-90 target to help end the AIDS pandemic by 2020. Nonetheless, the rate of immunological recovery in the study cohort was low. Hence, early initiation of HAART should be strengthened to achieve good virological suppression and immunological recovery.","Melku, Mulugeta; Abebe, Gizachew; Teketel, Amanuel; Asrie, Fikir; Yalew, Aregawi; Biadgo, Belete; Kassa, Eyuel; Damtie, Debasu; Anlay, Degefaye Zelalem",Environ Health Prev Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7444678/,12

OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to investigate the efficacy of oral sildenafil and intravenous milrinone infusion and compare the effects of these drugs in combination versus as monotherapy in neonates with PPHN. METHODS: A double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in which neonates with PPHN were divided into three groups of 20 patients each: group 1 received oral sildenafil starting at 0.5 mg/kg every 6 h to a target maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg every 6 h; group 2 received intravenous milrinone 0.5 μg/kg/min as a continuous infusion; and group 3 received both oral sildenafil and intravenous milrinone. RESULTS: Post-treatment pulmonary artery systolic pressure was significantly lower in group 3 than in groups 1 and 2, which both received monotherapy (p = 0.031). The oxygenation index also decreased significantly in the dual-therapy group (p = 0.002) compared with the monotherapy groups. Combined use of both drugs demonstrated a beneficial synergistic effect with better outcomes and reduced mortality. CONCLUSION: Dual therapy using sildenafil and milrinone was superior to monotherapy with either drug in neonates with severe PPHN and is recommended for use in resource-constrained settings.

These will most likely occur in the fallen stock scheme, with approximately a 25% probability of at least 1 further scrapie positive, with a very low probability (~0.2%) of having up to three additional scrapie positives.

The group included virgin males, virgin females, and mated females, and it was produced by using a four-way cross-breeding system that generates genetic heterogeneity equivalent to a very large sibship. An analysis of covariance showed that four T-cell subsets—CD4, CD4 memory, CD4 naïve, and CD4 cells expressing P-glycoprotein—were significant predictors (p< .003) of longevity when measured at 18 months of age after adjustment for the possible effects of gender and mating. The subset marked by CD4 and P-glycoprotein expression showed a significant interaction effect: this subset predicted longevity only in males. Among subsets measured when the mice were 8 months of age, only the levels of CD8 memory cells predicted longevity (p= .016); the prognostic value of this subset was largely limited to mated females. A cluster analysis that separated mice into two groups based upon similarity of T-cell subset patterns measured at 18 months showed that these two groups differed in life expectancy. Specifically, mice characterized by relatively low levels of CD4 and CD8 memory cells, high levels of CD4 naïve cells, and low levels of CD4 cells with P-glycoprotein (64% of the total) lived significantly longer (50 days = 6%; p< .0007) than mice in the other cluster. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that patterns of T-cell subsets vary among mice in a manner than can predict longevity in middle age, and they suggest that these subsets may prove to be useful for further studies of the genetics of aging and age-sensitive traits.","Miller, Richard A.",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7537444/,12

In this paper we assess the 1918-flu long-term effects not just of in utero exposure but also during infancy and early childhood. A unique set of events that took place in Puerto Rico during 1918–1919 generated conditions of a “double quasi-natural experiment”. We exploit these conditions to empirically identify effects of exposure to the 1918 flu pandemic and those of the devastation left by an earthquake-tsunami that struck the island in 1918. Because the earthquake-tsunami affected mostly the Western coast of the island whereas early (in utero and postnatal) exposure to the flu was restricted to those born in the interval 1917–1920, we use geographic variation to identify the effects of the quake and timing of birth variation to identify those of the flu. We benefit from availability of information on markers of nutritional status in a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 75 and older in 2002. We make two contributions. First, unlike most fetal-origins research that singles out early nutritional status as a determinant of adult health, we hypothesize that the 1918 flu damaged the nutritional status of adult survivors who, at the time of the flu, were in utero or infants. Second, we target markers of nutritional status largely set when the adult survivors were infants and young children. Estimates of effects of the pandemic are quite large mostly among females and those who were exposed to the earthquake-tsunami. Impacts of the flu in areas less affected by the earthquake are smaller but do vary by area flu severity. These findings constitute empirical evidence supporting the conjecture that effects of the 1918 flu and/or the earthquake are associated not just with disruption experienced during the fetal period but also postnatally.","Palloni, Alberto; McEniry, Mary; Huangfu, Yiyue; Beltran-Sanchez, Hiram",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7575088/,12

The intervention was long-term paired associative simulation (PAS). We aimed to provide PAS until full recovery of hand muscle strength occurred, or until improvements ceased. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old man with traumatic C7 AIS B tetraplegia was administered PAS three times per week. After 24 weeks, PAS was combined with concomitant motor training of the remaining weak hand muscles. Outcome measures included the manual muscle test (MMT), motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), F-responses, hand functional tests, and the spinal cord independence measure (SCIM). DISCUSSION: After 47 weeks of PAS the subject had improved self-care and indoor mobility and was able to perform complex motor tasks (SCIM score improved from 40 to 56). His left hand regained maximum MMT score (total 75; increase of score from baseline condition 19); the effect remained stable in the 32-week follow up. In the right-hand muscles, MMT scores of 4–5 were observed in follow up (total 71; increase from baseline 48). Improved values were also observed in other outcomes. This is the first demonstration of long-term PAS restoring muscle strength corresponding to MMT scores of 4–5 in an individual with chronic SCI. The effect persisted for several months, indicating that PAS induces stable plastic changes in the corticospinal pathway.","Rodionov, A.; Savolainen, S.; Kirveskari, E.; Mäkelä, J.

Evidence supports the positive effect of community-based exercise (CEXE) programs on cardiovascular health and quality of life. This research aimed to examine the effects of a 3-month CEXE on health-related quality of life and cardiovascular risk factors in two Brazilian populations. Methods: Adults with an average age of 70.2 ± 5.4 years were recruited to engage in an individually designed group based CEXE program two to three times/week (aerobic exercise, circuit resistance training, and stretching exercises for 1 h each time). Once a week, competitions were held to improve socialization and collaboration capacity among group members. The CEXE group was compared with a sedentary group. Cardiovascular outcomes were blood pressure, triglycerides, body mass index, waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and glycemia. Health-related quality of life was evaluated using the Short Form-36. Results: Of the cardiovascular outcomes studied, the CEXE program significantly reduced systolic blood pressure [5.7 (95% CI 0.2 to 11.3), p < 0.05] and the triglyceride–HDL-C ratio [0.8 (95% CI 0.05 to 1.5), p < 0.05], whereas HDL-C was significantly increased [4.4 (95% CI 0.02 to 8.8), p < 0.05]. A significant improvement in the Short Form-36 subscales occurred in CEXE but not in the control group: physical functioning score [increase of 24.2 (95% CI 11.8 to 36.5) vs. −9.2 (95% CI −21.5 to 3.2), p < 0.001], physical role functioning score [increase of 35.4 (95% CI 12.8 to 58.0) vs. 16.7 (95% CI −6.0 to 39.3), p < 0.01], and general health score [increase of 23.7 (95% CI: 36.9. to 10.4) vs. 2.4 (95% CI −10.9 to 15.7), p < 0.001]. Conclusion: This study shows that in older adults, a 12-week physical activity program can significantly decrease cardiovascular risk and improve health-related quality of life measures. An important transferable sociocultural strategy of our exercise program was to establish social interactions during and outside the CEXE program.","Pereira de Lima, Marcelo; Conopca, Severo; Miyabara, Renata; Romeiro, Geovanna; Campos, Luciana A.; Baltatu, Ovidiu C.",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7606879/,12

In this review, we provide consensus recommendations on behalf of the European Confederation for Medical Mycology (ECMM) for the diagnosis of bIFI caused by invasive yeasts, molds, and endemic mycoses, to guide diagnostic efforts in patients receiving antifungals and support the design of future clinical trials in the field of clinical mycology. The cornerstone of lab-based diagnosis of breakthrough infections for yeast and endemic mycoses remain conventional culture, to accurately identify the causative pathogen and allow for antifungal susceptibility testing. The impact of non-culture-based methods are not well-studied for the definite diagnosis of breakthrough invasive yeast infections. Non-culture-based methods have an important role for the diagnosis of breakthrough invasive mold infections, in particular invasive aspergillosis, and a combination of testing involving conventional culture, antigen-based assays, and PCR-based assays should be considered.

Rapid and informed guidance of epidemic (research) responses to severe infectious disease outbreaks requires quick compilation and integration of existing pathophysiological knowledge. As a case study we chose the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak that started in 2015 to develop a proof-of-concept knowledge repository. To extract data from available sources and build a computationally tractable and comprehensive molecular interaction map we applied generic knowledge management software for literature mining, expert knowledge curation, data integration, reporting and visualization. A multi-disciplinary team of experts, including clinicians, virologists, bioinformaticians and knowledge management specialists, followed a pre-defined workflow for rapid integration and evaluation of available evidence. While conventional approaches usually require months to comb through the existing literature, the initial ZIKV KnowledgeBase (ZIKA KB) was completed within a few weeks. Recently we updated the ZIKA KB with additional curated data from the large amount of literature published since 2016 and made it publicly available through a web interface together with a step-by-step guide to ensure reproducibility of the described use case. In addition, a detailed online user manual is provided to enable the ZIKV research community to generate hypotheses, share knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and interactively explore and interpret data. A workflow for rapid response during outbreaks was generated, validated and refined and is also made available. The process described here can be used for timely structuring of pathophysiological knowledge for future threats.

14777,Characteristics and resolution of hypertension in obese African American bariatric cohort,2021-01-18,"BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of BPD includes inflammation and oxidative stress in the immature lung. Corticosteroids improve respiratory status and outcome, but the optimal treatment regimen for benefit with low systemic effects is uncertain. METHODS: In a pilot dose escalation trial, we administered ≤5 daily doses of budesonide in surfactant to 24 intubated premature infants (Steroid And Surfactant in ELGANs (SASSIE)). Untargeted metabolomics was performed on dried blood spots using UPLC-MS/MS. Tracheal aspirate IL-8 concentration was determined as a measure of lung inflammation. RESULTS: Metabolomics data for 829 biochemicals were obtained on 121 blood samples over 96 h from 23 infants receiving 0.025, 0.05, or 0.1 mg budesonide/kg. Ninety metabolites were increased or decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner at q ≤ 0.1 with overrepresentation in lipid and amino acid super pathways. Different dose response patterns occurred, with negative regulation associated with highest sensitivity to budesonide. Baseline levels of 22 regulated biochemicals correlated with lung inflammation (IL-8), with highest significance for sphingosine and thiamin. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous metabolic pathways are regulated in a dose-dependent manner by glucocorticoids, which apparently act via distinct mechanisms that impact dose sensitivity. The findings identify candidate blood biochemicals as biomarkers of lung inflammation and systemic responses to corticosteroids. IMPACT: Treatment of premature infants in respiratory failure with 0.1 mg/kg intra-tracheal budesonide in surfactant alters levels of ~11% of detected blood biochemicals in discrete time- and dose-dependent patterns. A subset of glucocorticoid-regulated biochemicals is associated with lung inflammatory status as assessed by lung fluid cytokine concentration. Lower doses of budesonide in surfactant than currently used may provide adequate anti-inflammatory responses in the lung with fewer systemic effects, improving the benefit:risk ratio.","Ballard, Philip L.; Torgerson, Dara; Wadhawan, Rajan; Hudak, Mark L.; Weitkamp, Joern-Hendrik; Harris, Julia; Asselin, Jeanette; Chapin, Cheryl; Ballard, Roberta A.; McEvoy, Cindy T.",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7814527/,12

15506,HIV induces airway basal progenitor cells to adopt an inflammatory phenotype,2021-02-17,"BACKGROUND: ECG interpretation requires expertise and is mostly based on physician recognition of specific patterns, which may be challenging in rare cardiac diseases. Deep neural networks (DNNs) can discover complex features in ECGs and may facilitate the detection of novel features which possibly play a pathophysiological role in relatively unknown diseases. Using a cohort of PLN (phospholamban) p.Arg14del mutation carriers, we aimed to investigate whether a novel DNN-based approach can identify established ECG features, but moreover, we aimed to expand our knowledge on novel ECG features in these patients. METHODS: A DNN was developed on 12-lead median beat ECGs of 69 patients and 1380 matched controls and independently evaluated on 17 patients and 340 controls. Differentiating features were visualized using Guided Gradient Class Activation Mapping++. Novel ECG features were tested for their diagnostic value by adding them to a logistic regression model including established ECG features. RESULTS: The DNN showed excellent discriminatory performance with a c-statistic of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91–0.99) and sensitivity and specificity of 0.82 and 0.93, respectively. Visualizations revealed established ECG features (low QRS voltages and T-wave inversions), specified these features (eg, R- and T-wave attenuation in V2/V3) and identified novel PLN-specific ECG features (eg, increased PR-duration). The logistic regression baseline model improved significantly when augmented with the identified features (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A DNN-based feature detection approach was able to discover and visualize disease-specific ECG features in PLN mutation carriers and revealed yet unidentified features. This novel approach may help advance diagnostic capabilities in daily practice.","van de Leur, Rutger R.; Taha, Karim; Bos, Max N.; van der Heijden, Jeroen F.; Gupta, Deepak; Cramer, Maarten J.; Hassink, Rutger J.; van der Harst, Pim; Doevendans, Pieter A.; Asselbergs, Folkert W.; van Es, René",Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7892204/,12

However, presently available tools for predicting RBP–RNA interactions employ RNA sequence and/or predicted RNA structures, and therefore do not capture their condition-dependent nature. Here, after profiling transcriptome-wide in vivo RNA secondary structures in seven cell types, we developed PrismNet, a deep learning tool that integrates experimental in vivo RNA structure data and RBP binding data for matched cells to accurately predict dynamic RBP binding in various cellular conditions. PrismNet results for 168 RBPs support its utility for both understanding CLIP-seq results and largely extending such interaction data to accurately analyze additional cell types. Further, PrismNet employs an “attention” strategy to computationally identify exact RBP-binding nucleotides, and we discovered enrichment among dynamic RBP-binding sites for structure-changing variants (riboSNitches), which can link genetic diseases with dysregulated RBP bindings. Our rich profiling data and deep learning-based prediction tool provide access to a previously inaccessible layer of cell-type-specific RBP–RNA interactions, with clear utility for understanding and treating human diseases.","Sun, Lei; Xu, Kui; Huang, Wenze; Yang, Yucheng T.; Li, Pan; Tang, Lei; Xiong, Tuanlin; Zhang, Qiangfeng Cliff",Cell Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7900654/,12

15857,Differential effect of anesthetics on mucociliary clearance in vivo in mice,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND: Asthma was identified as the most common comorbidity in hospitalized patients during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. We determined using a murine model of allergic asthma whether these mice experienced increased morbidity from pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) viral infection and whether blockade of interleukin-4 receptor α (IL-4Rα), a critical mediator of T(h)2 signalling, improved their outcomes. METHODS: Male BALB/c mice were intranasally sensitized with house dust mite antigen (Der p 1) for 2 weeks; the mice were then inoculated intranasally with a single dose of pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1). The mice were administered intraperitoneally anti-IL-4Rα through either a prophylactic or a therapeutic treatment strategy. RESULTS: Infection with pH1N1 of mice sensitized to house dust mite (HDM) led to a 24% loss in weight by day 7 of infection (versus 14% in non-sensitized mice; p < .05). This was accompanied by increased viral load in the airways and a dampened anti-viral host responses to the infection. Treatment of HDM sensitized mice with a monoclonal antibody against IL-4Rα prior to or following pH1N1 infection prevented the excess weight loss, reduced the viral load in the lungs and ameliorated airway eosinophilia and systemic inflammation related to the pH1N1 infection. CONCLUSION: Together, these data implicate allergic asthma as a significant risk factor for H1N1-related morbidity and reveal a potential therapeutic role for IL-4Rα signalling blockade in reducing the severity of influenza infection in those with allergic airway disease.","Shahangian, Kimia; Ngan, David A.; Chen, H.

15938,"Agreement and reliability of the Feline Grimace Scale among cat owners, veterinarians, veterinary students and nurses",2021-03-04,"Gastrointestinal inflammation is a hallmark of highly prevalent disorders, including cancer treatment–induced mucositis and ulcerative colitis. These disorders cause debilitating symptoms, have a significant impact on quality of life, and are poorly managed. The activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been proposed to have a major influence on the inflammatory signalling pathways of the intestinal tract. Inhibition of TLR4 has been postulated as an effective way to treat intestinal inflammation. However, there are a limited number of studies looking into the potential of TLR4 antagonism as a therapeutic approach for intestinal inflammation. This review surveyed available literature and reported on the in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo effects of TLR4 antagonism on different models of intestinal inflammation. Of the studies reviewed, evidence suggests that there is indeed potential for TLR4 antagonists to treat inflammation, although only a limited number of studies have investigated treating intestinal inflammation with TLR4 antagonists directly. These results warrant further research into the effect of TLR4 antagonists in the intestinal tract.","Tam, Janine S.

The breast cancer-pooling project demonstrated that sustained weight loss of 2 to 4.5 kg is associated with an 18% lower risk of breast cancer, highlighting the importance of small changes in body weight. Our study aimed to assess the effectiveness a volunteer-delivered, community based, weight management programme (ActWELL) for women with a BMI > 25 kg/m(2) attending NHS Scotland Breast Screening clinics. METHODS: A multicentre, 1:1 parallel group, randomised controlled trial was undertaken in 560 women aged 50 to 70 years with BMI > 25 kg/m(2). On completion of baseline measures, all participants received a breast cancer prevention leaflet. Intervention group participants received the ActWELL intervention which focussed on personalised diet advice and pedometer walking plans. The programme was delivered in leisure centres by (the charity) Breast Cancer Now volunteer coaches. Primary outcomes were changes between groups at 12 months in body weight (kg) and physical activity (accelerometer measured step count). RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-nine women were allocated to the intervention group and 281 to the comparison group. Twelve-month data were available from 240 (81%) intervention and 227 (85%) comparison group participants. Coaches delivered 523 coaching sessions and 1915 support calls to 279 intervention participants. Mean weight change was − 2.5 kg (95% CI − 3.1 to − 1.9) in the intervention group and − 1.2 kg (− 1.8 to 0.6) in the comparison group. The adjusted mean difference was − 1.3 kg (95% CI − 2.2 to − 0.4, P = 0.003). The odds ratio for losing 5% weight was 2.20 (95% CI 1.4 to 3.4, p = 0.0005) in favour of the intervention. The adjusted mean difference in step counts between groups was 483 steps/day (95% CI − 635 to 1602) (NS). CONCLUSIONS: A community weight management intervention initiated at breast screening clinics and delivered by volunteer coaches doubled the likelihood of clinically significant weight loss at 12 months (compared with usual care) offering significant potential to decrease breast cancer risk.

15984,PD-1 immunobiology in glomerulonephritis and renal cell carcinoma,2021-03-06,"BACKGROUND: Abolished circadian rhythm is associated with altered cognitive function, delirium, and as a result increased mortality in critically ill patients, especially in those who are mechanically ventilated. The causes are multifactorial, of which changes in circadian rhythmicity may play a role. Melatonin plays a crucial role as part of the circadian and sleep/wake cycle. Whether sedation effects circadian regulation is unknown. Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate the melatonin concentration in critically ill patients randomized to sedation or non-sedation and to investigate the correlation with delirium. METHODS: All patients were included and randomized at the intensive care unit at the hospital of southwest Jutland, Denmark. Seventy-nine patients completed the study (41 sedated and 38 non-sedated). S-melatonin was measured 3 times per day, (03.00, 14.00, and 22.00), for 4 consecutive days in total, starting on the second day upon randomization/intubation. The study was conducted as a sub-study to the NON-SEDA study in which one hundred consecutive patients were randomized to sedation or non-sedation with a daily wake-up call (50 in each arm). Primary outcome: melatonin concentration in sedated vs. non-sedated patients (analyzed using linear regression). Secondary outcome: risk of developing delirium or non-medically induced (NMI) coma in sedated vs. non-sedated patients, assessed by CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit) analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Melatonin concentration was suppressed in sedated patients compared to the non-sedated. All patients experienced an elevated peak melatonin level early on in the course of their critical illness (p = 0.01). The risk of delirium or coma (NMI) was significantly lower in the non-sedated group (OR 0.42 CI 0.27; 0.66 p < 0.0001). No significant relationship between delirium development and suppressed melatonin concentration was established in this study (OR 1.004 p = 0.29 95% CI 0.997; 1.010). CONCLUSION: Melatonin concentration was suppressed in sedated, critically ill patients, when compared to non-sedated controls and the frequency of delirium was elevated in sedated patients.

This study aimed to investigate antifungal property of 19, 20-epoxycytochalasin Q (ECQ), derived from medicinal mushroom Xylaria sp. BCC 1067 of tropical forests. In a model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ECQ is more toxic in the erg6∆ strain, which has previously been shown to allow higher uptake of many hydrophilic toxins. We selected one pathway to study the effects of ECQ at very high levels on transcription: the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, which is unlikely to be the primary target of ECQ. Ergosterol serves many functions that cholesterol does in human cells. ECQ’s transcriptional effects were correlated with altered sterol and triacylglycerol levels. In the ECQ-treated Δerg6 strain, which presumably takes up far more ECQ than the wild-type strain, there was cell rupture. Increased actin aggregation and lipid droplets assembly were also found in the erg6∆ mutant. Thereby, ECQ is suggested to sensitize yeast cells lacking ERG6 through actin-targeting and consequently but not primarily led to disruption of lipid homeostasis. Investigation of cytochalasins may provide valuable insight with potential biopharmaceutical applications in treatments of fungal infection, cancer or metabolic disorder.","Watchaputi, Kwanrutai; Somboon, Pichayada; Phromma-in, Nipatthra; Ratanakhanokchai, Khanok; Soontorngun, Nitnipa",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8032726/,12

To identify new protein signatures of the two infections, we used next-generation proteomics to profile 122 serum samples from 62 Zika and dengue patients. We quantified >500 proteins and identified 13 proteins that were significantly differentially expressed (adjusted p-value < 0.05). These proteins typically function in infection and wound healing, with several also linked to pregnancy and brain function. We successfully validated expression differences with Carbonic Anhydrase 2 in both the original and an independent sample set. Three of the differentially expressed proteins, i.e., Fibrinogen Alpha, Platelet Factor 4 Variant 1, and Pro-Platelet Basic Protein, predicted Zika virus infection at a ∼70% true-positive and 6% false-positive rate. Further, we showed that intraindividual temporal changes in protein signatures can disambiguate diagnoses and serve as indicators for past infections. Taken together, we demonstrate that serum proteomics can provide new resources that serve to distinguish between different viral infections.","Allgoewer, Kristina; Maity, Shuvadeep; Zhao, Alice; Lashua, Lauren; Ramgopal, Moti; Balkaran, Beni N.; Liu, Liyun; Purushwani, Savita; Arévalo, Maria T.; Ross, Ted M.; Choi, Hyungwon; Ghedin, Elodie; Vogel, Christine",Mol Cell Proteomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8042398/,12

17029,Untargeted Metabolomics Insights into Newborns with Congenital Zika Infection,2021-04-13,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The risk posed by traffic likely impacts equestrians’ decisions around road use, potentially limiting or preventing exercise sessions. This study identifies how frequently equestrians use roads and what impacts their ability to do so. Over 6000 UK equestrians completed an online questionnaire about their exercise behaviours, road use and experiences of road-related incidents. Most equestrians use roads regularly. In the previous year, 68% of equestrians experienced a near-miss and 6% an injury-causing incident. Our results found that regional differences in road use and near-miss experiences coincided with off-road route availability. Road use was associated with the proximity of off-road routes, and road-using equestrians covered longer distances. Near-misses were associated with increasing frequency of weekly road use. Younger equestrians were more likely to use roads, but also to experience near-misses. Injury-causing incidents were associated with increasing road-use anxiety or ceasing to use roads (due to strong feelings of danger, compromised safety and conflict with other road users), the proximity of off-road routes, having a near-miss and riding while leading a ridden horse; often a child. Targeted campaigns encouraging responsible road use, better off-road access and inclusion of equestrians in planning and development initiatives would create safer equestrian spaces, particularly for young people. ABSTRACT: Real or perceived traffic risk is a significant barrier to walking and cycling. To understand whether similar barriers influence equestrians, this study obtained exercise behaviours, road use and experiences of road-related incidents from UK equestrians (n = 6390) via an online questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with road use and experiencing a near-miss or injury-causing incident in the previous year. Content analysis identified themes around equestrians’ decisions not to use roads. Our results show that most equestrians (84%) use roads at least once weekly, and in the previous year, 67.7% had a near-miss and 6.1% an injury-causing incident. Road use differs regionally, with exercise type and off-road route availability. Road-using equestrians covered greater daily distances and were younger. However, younger equestrians were at higher risk of near-misses. Respondents’ decisions not to use roads were based on individualised risk assessments arising from: the road itself, perceptions of other road users, the individual horse and the handler’s own emotional management. Roads were perceived as extremely dangerous places with potentially high conflict risk. Injury-causing incidents were associated with increasing road-use anxiety or ceasing to use roads, the proximity of off-road routes, having a near-miss and type of road use. Targeted road-safety campaigns and improved off-road access would create safer equestrian spaces.","Pollard, Danica; Furtado, Tamzin",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8070417/,12
17049,Cancer Nanopharmaceuticals: Physicochemical Characterization and In Vitro/In Vivo Applications,2021-04-15,"We recently reported that the in vitro and in vivo survivals of Rickettsia australis are Atg5-dependent, in association with an inhibited level of anti-rickettsial cytokine, IL-1β. In the present study, we sought to investigate how R. australis interacts with host innate immunity via an Atg5-dependent autophagic response. We found that the serum levels of IFN-γ and G-CSF in R. australis-infected Atg5(flox/flox)Lyz-Cre mice were significantly less compared to Atg5(flox/flox) mice, accompanied by significantly lower rickettsial loads in tissues with inflammatory cellular infiltrations including neutrophils. R. australis infection differentially regulated a significant number of genes in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) in an Atg5-depdent fashion as determined by RNA sequencing and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, including genes in the molecular networks of IL-1 family cytokines and PI3K-Akt-mTOR. The secretion levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α, IL-18, TNF-α, and IL-6, by R. australis-infected Atg5(flox/flox)Lyz-Cre BMMs were significantly greater compared to infected Atg5(flox/flox) BMMs. Interestingly, R. australis significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated mTOR and P70S6K at a time when the autophagic response is induced. Rapamycin treatment nearly abolished the phosphorylated mTOR and P70S6K but did not promote significant autophagic flux during R. australis infection. These results highlight that R. australis modulates an Atg5-dependent autophagic response, which is not sensitive to regulation by mTORC1 signaling in macrophages. Overall, we demonstrate that R. australis counteracts host innate immunity including IL-1β-dependent inflammatory response to support the bacterial survival via an mTORC1-resistant autophagic response in macrophages.","Bechelli, Jeremy; Rumfield, Claire S.; Walker, David H.; Widen, Steven; Khanipov, Kamil; Fang, Rong",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8071864/,12

17215,A computational method for drug sensitivity prediction of cancer cell lines based on various molecular information,2021-04-29,"IMPORTANCE: Accumulating evidence indicates that higher blood pressure (BP) variability from one physician office visit to the next (hereafter referred to as visit-to-visit BP variability) is associated with poor outcomes. Short-term measurement (throughout 1 year) of visit-to-visit BP variability in high-risk older patients may help identify patients at increased risk of death. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether short-term visit-to-visit BP variability is associated with increased long-term mortality risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The US cohort of the International Verapamil SR-Trandolapril Study (INVEST), a randomized clinical trial of 16 688 patients aged 50 years or older with hypertension and coronary artery disease, was conducted between September 2, 1997, and December 15, 2000, with in-trial follow-up through February 14, 2003. The study evaluated a calcium antagonist (sustained-release verapamil plus trandolapril) vs β-blocker (atenolol plus hydrochlorothiazide) treatment strategy. Blood pressure measurement visits were scheduled every 6 weeks for the first 6 months and biannually thereafter. Statistical analysis was performed from September 2, 1997, to May 1, 2014. EXPOSURES: Visit-to-visit systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP variability during the first year of enrollment using 4 different BP variability measures: standard deviation, coefficient of variation, average real variability, and variability independent of the mean. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause death, assessed via the US National Death Index, beginning after the exposure assessment period through May 1, 2014. RESULTS: For the present post hoc analysis, long-term mortality data were available on 16 688 patients (9001 women [54%]; mean [SD] age, 66.5 [9.9] years; 45% White patients, 16% Black patients, and 37% Hispanic patients). During a mean (SD) follow-up of 10.9 (4.2) years, 5058 patients (30%) died. All 4 variability measures for SBP were significantly associated with long-term mortality after adjustment for baseline demographic characteristics and comorbidities. After comparison of lowest vs highest variability measure quintiles, the magnitude of the association with death remained statistically significant even after adjustment for baseline demographic characteristics and comorbidities (average real variability: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.08-1.30; standard deviation: aHR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.24; coefficient of variation: aHR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.26; variability independent of the mean: aHR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.05-1.25). The signal was stronger in women compared with men. Associations of diastolic BP variability measures with death were weaker than for SBP and were not significant after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that, in a large population of older patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease, short-term visit-to-visit SBP variability was associated with excess long-term mortality, especially for women. Efforts to identify and minimize visit-to-visit SBP variability may be important in reducing excess mortality later in life.

We aimed to assess whether plasma levels of mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) and C-terminal pro-endothelin-1 (CT-proET-1) predict respiratory morbidity. METHODS: This was a prospective, two-center, observational cohort study. MR-proANP and CT-proET-1 were measured at day 7 (±2) of life. Associations with duration of supplemental oxygen and the composite outcome of moderate or severe BPD or death (BPD/death) were investigated. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-nine infants <32 weeks were included (median gestational age [GA] 29.6 weeks [interquartile range 29.0–30.7], median birth weight 1150 g [IQR 840–1410]). MR-proANP and CT-proET-1 were associated with the duration of supplemental oxygen in univariable analysis (both p < 0.001) but not after adjusting for co-factors. Infants with BPD/death showed higher plasma levels of MR-proANP (623.50 pmol/L [IQR 458.50–881.38] vs. 308.35 pmol/L [IQR 216.72–538.10]; p < 0.001) and CT-proET-1 (255.40 pmol/L [IQR 202.60–311.15] vs. 198.30 pmol/L [IQR 154.70–297.95]; p = 0.015) compared to infants without BPD/death. Levels of both biomarkers were significantly associated with BPD/death in univariable models but not after adjusting for co-factors. CONCLUSIONS: MR-proANP and CT-proET-1 are associated with the duration of supplemental oxygen and the composite outcome BPD/death, but their prognostic value does not complement that of clinical risk factors. IMPACT: Plasma levels of MR-proANP and CT-proET-1, measured on day 7 of life (±2 days) are associated in univariable analyses with duration of supplemental oxygen and the combined outcome of BPD or death in VLGA infants. Associations between both biomarkers and respiratory morbidity do not persist in multivariable models, in particular when gestational age is included. MR-proANP and CT-proET-1 have limited additional value to predict respiratory morbidity in VLGA infants compared to clinical parameters.","Gerull, Roland; Neumann, Roland P.; Atkinson, Andrew; Bernasconi, Luca; Schulzke, Sven M.; Wellmann, Sven",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8100356/,12

Recently, it was suggested that diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (D(LCO)) should be added to multidimensional tools for assessing COPD. This study aimed to compare the D(LCO) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) to identify better prognostic factors for admitted patients with AECOPD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 342 patients with AECOPD receiving inpatient treatment. We classified 342 severe AECOPD patients by severity of D(LCO) and FEV(1) (≤ vs. > 50% predicted). We tested the association of FEV(1) and D(LCO) with the following outcomes: in-hospital mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, need for intensive care unit (ICU) care. We analyzed the prognostic factors by multivariate analysis using logistic regression. In addition, we conducted a correlation analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, D(LCO) was associated with mortality (odds ratio = 4.408; 95% CI 1.070–18.167; P = 0.040) and need for mechanical ventilation (odds ratio = 2.855; 95% CI 1.216–6.704; P = 0.016) and ICU care (odds ratios = 2.685; 95% CI 1.290–5.590; P = 0.008). However, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality rate when using FEV(1) classification (P = 0.075). In multivariate linear regression analyses, D(LCO) (B = − 0.542 ± 0.121, P < 0.001) and FEV(1) (B = − 0.106 ± 0.106, P = 0.006) were negatively associated with length of hospital stay. In addition, D(LCO) showed better predictive ability than FEV(1) in ROC curve analysis.

17414,Protective effect of recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum against H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress in HUVEC cells,2021-05-13,"Boldenone Undecylenate (BLD) is a synthetic derivative of testosterone and a widely used anabolic androgenic steroid. The health risk of BLD use as a pharmaceutical or dietary supplement is still underestimated and under-reported. Vitamin C (VC) has been recognized as an antioxidant with prominent hepatorenal protective effects. This study investigated the possible preventive activity of VC against BLD-induced hepatorenal damage. Forty adult male Wistar rats were classified into five groups: control, vehicle control, VC (orally given 120 mg/kg b. wt./day), BLD (intramuscularly injected 5 mg/kg b. wt./week), and BLD + VC-treated groups. The experiment continued for eight weeks. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured. Serum contents of total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), globulin, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and very-low-density lipoprotein–cholesterol (VLDL-C) were also assayed. Urea, creatinine, and uric acid levels were determined together with sodium and potassium electrolytes measuring. Moreover, oxidative stress indicators including reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and glutathione reductase (GSR) as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured in both hepatic and renal tissues. Corresponding histological examination of renal and hepatic tissues was conducted. Besides, immunohistochemical evaluations for androgen receptors protein (AR) and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp 90) expressions were performed. BLD caused significant rises in serum ALT, AST, TP, ALB, TC, TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C, urea, creatinine, uric acid, potassium, and MDA levels. Further, BLD-injected rats showed significant declines in the serum levels of HDL-C, sodium, GSH, GPx, GST, and GSR. Besides, distinct histopathological perturbations were detected in renal and hepatic tissues of BLD-injected rats. AR and Hsp 90 immunoexpression were increased in hepatic and renal tissues. In contrast, VC significantly reversed the BLD-induced hepatorenal damage in co-treated rats but not ameliorated AR protein overexpression. VC could be an efficient preventive supplement for mitigating BLD-induced hepatorenal damage, possibly via controlling oxidative stress events.","Behairy, Amany; Mohamed, Wafaa A.

17711,Exposition of respiratory ailments from trace metals concentrations in incenses,2021-05-21,"BACKGROUND: For the safety monitoring of vaccinations postlicensure, reports of adverse events after immunization (AEFIs) are crucial. New technologies such as digital mobile apps can be used as an active approach to capture these events. We therefore conducted a feasibility study among recipients of the influenza vaccination using an app for assessment of the reporting of AEFIs. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to determine factors influencing adherence to and correct use of a newly developed app for individuals to report AEFI for 3 months using regular reminder functions, to identify determinants of AEFI occurrence and define reported AEFI types. METHODS: We developed the app (SafeVac) and offered it to recipients of the influenza vaccination in 3 occupational settings in fall 2018. In this prospective longitudinal feasibility study, data on AEFIs were generated through SafeVac for 3 months. Using logistic and Cox regression, we assessed associations between app adherence, correct app entry, AEFIs, and sociodemographic parameters. RESULTS: Of the individuals who logged into SafeVac, 61.4% (207/337) used the app throughout a 3-month period. App use adherence was negatively associated with female sex (odds ratio [OR] 0.47; CI 0.25-0.91) and correct app entry was negatively associated with older age (OR 0.96; CI 0.93-0.99) and lower education (OR 0.31; CI 0.13-0.76). AEFI occurrence was associated with female sex (hazard ratio 1.41; CI 1.01-1.96) and negatively with older age (hazard ratio 0.98; CI 0.97-0.99). The most common AEFIs reported were injection site pain (106/337), pain in extremity (103/337), and fatigue/asthenia (73/337). CONCLUSIONS: Digital AEFI reporting was feasible with SafeVac and generated plausible results for this observation period and setting. Studies directly comparing SafeVac with conventional passive reporting schemes could determine whether such digital approaches improve completeness, timeliness, and sensitivity of vaccine vigilance. Further studies should evaluate if these results are transferable to other vaccinations and populations and if introduction of such a tool has an influence on vaccination readiness and therefore vaccine safety.","Nguyen, Minh Tam H; Krause, Gérard; Keller-Stanislawski, Brigitte; Glöckner, Stephan; Mentzer, Dirk; Ott, Jördis J",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8140379/,12

The aim of the present study was to determine whether outpatients diagnosed with PFPS obtained improvement in pain and function after treatment by dynamic application of monopolar dielectric diathermy by emission of radiofrequency (MDR). Materials and Methods: An experimental study was conducted with 27 subjects with PFPS. Subjects were treated with 10 sessions of MDR in dynamic application. The visual analogue scale (VAS), the Kujala scale, the DN4 questionnaire, the lower extremity function scale (LEFS), the range of movement (ROM) in knee flexion and extension and the daily drug intake were measured pre- and post-intervention and at the time of the follow-up (six months). Results: Statistically significant differences were found in pain perception (VAS: F(1,26) = 92.43, p < 0.000, ŋ(2) = 0.78 and DN4: F(1.26) = 124.15, p < 0.000, ŋ(2) = 0.82), as well as improvements in functionality (LEFS: F(1.26) = 72.42, p < 0.000, ŋ(2) = 0.74 and Kujala: F(1.26) = 40.37, p < 0.000, ŋ(2) = 0.61]) and in ROM (Flexion: F(1.26) = 63.15, p < 0.000, ŋ(2) = 0.71). No statistically significant changes in drug intake were found. Conclusions: The present study shows that the dynamic application of MDR seems effective in reducing pain and increasing functionality and knee flexion in patients with PFPS, after a follow-up of six months.","Albornoz-Cabello, Manuel; Barrios-Quinta, Cristo Jesús; Escobio-Prieto, Isabel; Sobrino-Sánchez, Raquel; Ibáñez-Vera, Alfonso Javier; Espejo-Antúnez, Luis",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8145052/,12

However, the science of treatment-as-prevention (TasP) may not be widely understood by people with and without HIV who could benefit from this information. We systematically reviewed the global literature on knowledge and attitudes related to TasP and interventions providing TasP or U = U information. We included studies of providers, patients, and communities from all regions of the world, published 2008–2020. We screened 885 papers and abstracts and identified 72 for inclusion. Studies in high-income settings reported high awareness of TasP but gaps in knowledge about the likelihood of transmission with undetectable HIV. Greater knowledge was associated with more positive attitudes towards TasP. Extant literature shows low awareness of TasP in Africa where 2 in 3 people with HIV live.

Infectious diseases of the spleen can be encountered in daily radiology practice, and differential diagnosis may sometimes be challenging. Infectious involvement of the spleen can be primary or secondary to a different source outside the spleen. Despite the fact that different infectious diseases may cause similar imaging findings, we believe that differential diagnosis between different causes may also be possible in certain patients with imaging. Early diagnosis may potentially enhance patients’ treatment and outcome. In this review, we aimed to increase imaging specialists’ awareness of splenic infections by describing the multimodality imaging features of common and atypical infections of the spleen with their differential diagnoses.","Karaosmanoglu, Ali Devrim; Uysal, Aycan; Onder, Omer; Hahn, Peter F.; Akata, Deniz; Ozmen, Mustafa Nasuh; Karcaaltıncaba, Musturay",Abdom Radiol (NY),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8160561/,12

Economic development in Thailand is managed by the community and government with support from the business sector. The economic system of Thailand aims to balance three conceptual pillars that can be described as ‘social, economic, and environmental’ dimensions. However, there is a lack of tools for data analysis and the evaluation of community well-being and economic functioning that can be applied to all relevant situations independent of external factors. In this paper, these authors produced an information analysis and evaluation model of the local economy (IAEM) that is based on the application of the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Data were collected using a questionnaire that was evaluated by experts regarding the project's capacity to meet economic, social, and environmental development goals according to the SEP for SDGs, which demonstrated a reliability of 0.88. For our statistical analysis, Multiple Linear Regression Analysis, Decision Matrix Analysis, K-Means, Percentage, and Average were performed for the analysis of data. The results showed that the SEP has a significant relationship to the SDGs at 89.60% (R(2) = 0.896, p < 0.001). IAEM provides a framework for analysis and evaluation of the local economy in six clusters that consist of water resources (WAT), human capacities and capabilities (HUM), economic stability (ECO), healthy communities (HEA), climate change (CLI), and the agricultural sector (AGR). Our results indicate that the IAEM can be used for the analysis and evaluation of the sustainability of a local economy based on the three pillars. The IAEM can be applied to policies and projects in sustainable development at each level of the local economy based on the SEP in a partnership with SDGs; this observation suggests that more implementation of development projects in accordance with the SEP will lead to increased development towards SDGs based on the three dimensions outlined.","Wongkumchai, Tachakorn; Kiattisin, Supaporn",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239734/,12
18668,Ten years of Scientific Reports,2021-06-30,"BACKGROUND: There is no universally accepted method to assess the pressure-generating capacity of inspiratory muscles in children on mechanical ventilation (MV), and no study describing its evolution over time in this population. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we have assessed the function of the inspiratory muscles in children on various modes of MV. During brief airway occlusion maneuvers, we simultaneously recorded airway pressure depression at the endotracheal tube (ΔPaw, force generation) and electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi, central respiratory drive) over five consecutive inspiratory efforts. The neuro-mechanical efficiency ratio (NME, ΔPaw/EAdi(max)) was also computed. The evolution over time of these indices in a group of children in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was primarily described. As a secondary objective, we compared these values to those measured in a group of children in the operating room (OR). RESULTS: In the PICU group, although median NME(occl) decreased over time during MV (regression coefficient − 0.016, p = 0.03), maximum ΔPaw(max) remained unchanged (regression coefficient 0.109, p = 0.50). Median NME(occl) at the first measurement in the PICU group (after 21 h of MV) was significantly lower than at the only measurement in the OR group (1.8 cmH(2)O/µV, Q(1)–Q(3) 1.3–2.4 vs. 3.7 cmH(2)O/µV, Q(1)–Q(3) 3.5–4.2; p = 0.015). Maximum ΔPaw(max) in the PICU group was, however, not significantly different from the OR group (35.1 cmH(2)O, Q(1)–Q(3) 21–58 vs. 31.3 cmH(2)O, Q(1)–Q(3) 28.5–35.5; p = 0.982). CONCLUSIONS: The function of inspiratory muscles can be monitored at the bedside of children on MV using brief airway occlusions. Inspiratory muscle efficiency was significantly lower in critically ill children than in children undergoing elective surgery, and it decreased over time during MV in critically ill children. This suggests that both critical illness and MV may have an impact on inspiratory muscle efficiency.","Crulli, Benjamin; Kawaguchi, Atsushi; Praud, Jean-Paul; Petrof, Basil J.; Harrington, Karen; Emeriaud, Guillaume",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8243304/,12

This investigation aims to probe the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of Maltoamide F. METHODS: The possible toxicity of Maltoamide F was evaluated by an acute toxicity test. To assess the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects of Maltoamide F on rats, the models of carrageenan-caused paw edema, xylene-induced ear edema, arachidonic-acid- (AA-) induced ear edema, formalin-caused plantar edema, and cotton-pellet-induced granuloma were established. Levels of TNF-α, PGE-2, and IL-6 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Maltoamide F was safe at oral doses of 1–10 mg/kg for rats. Maltoamide F (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) notably reduced carrageenan-induced edema percentage of paws in rats and decreased levels of PGE-2, IL-6, and TNF-α in homogenates of foot tissues. Maltoamide F (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) reduced levels of PGE-2, IL-6, and TNF-α in foot tissues of formalin-induced rats. Maltoamide F (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) repressed AA-induced increase of ear thickness in rats and reduced levels of PGE-2, IL-6, and TNF-α in homogenates of ear tissues. Maltoamide F (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) reduced xylene-induced weight of ear edema in rats and reduced levels of PGE-2, IL-6, and TNF-α in homogenates of ear tissues. Maltoamide F (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) reduced levels of PGE-2, IL-6, and TNF-α in homogenates of cotton ball granuloma of cotton-pellet-induced rats.

To establish a hyperspectral prediction model of soil organic matter (SOM) content, this study investigated a forested Eucalyptus plantation in Huangmian Forest Farm, Guangxi, China. The Ranger and Lasso algorithms were used to screen spectral bands. Subsequently, models were established using four algorithms: partial least squares regression, random forest (RF), a support vector machine, and an artificial neural network (ANN). The optimal model was then selected. The results showed that the modeling accuracy was higher when band selection was based on the Ranger algorithm than when it was based on the Lasso algorithm. ANN modeling had the best goodness of fit, and the model established by RF had the most stable modeling results. Based on the above results, a new method is proposed in this study for band selection in the early phase of soil hyperspectral modeling. The Ranger algorithm can be applied to screen the spectral bands, and ANN or RF can then be selected to construct the prediction model based on different datasets, which is applicable to establish the prediction model of SOM content in red soil plantations. This study provides a reference for the remote sensing of soil fertility in forests of different soil types and a theoretical basis for developing portable equipment for the hyperspectral measurement of SOM content in forest habitats.","Shi, Yuanyuan; Zhao, Junyu; Song, Xianchong; Qin, Zuoyu; Wu, Lichao; Wang, Huili; Tang, Jian",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8238212/,12

Of these AFE events, we identified 95 unannotated transcription start sites in mice using a de novo transcriptome generated by long-read native RNA-sequencing, one of which is in the cytosolic receptor for dsDNA and known inflammatory inducible gene, Aim2. We show that this unannotated AFE isoform of Aim2 is the predominant isoform expressed during inflammation and contains an iron-responsive element in its 5′UTR enabling mRNA translation to be regulated by iron levels.

Here, we hypothesized that women with AFLP exhibit elevated PlGF production in comparison to women with preeclampsia or hemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome. Making use of the well-known mathematical formulas describing drug-receptor interactions, we established that serum total PlGF could be accurately predicted from sFlt-1 and free PlGF levels (n=42; mean calculated K(D) of 50 pmol/L), yielding similar values as the previously published method of thermal dissociation of the sFlt-1-PlGF complexes (r=0.94, P<0.0001). We found that median levels of free PlGF were significantly lower in women with preeclampsia (n=13; 117pg/mL) or hemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome (n=12; 59 pg/mL) compared with women without preeclampsia (n=11; 349pg/mL, P<0.0001). In contrast, median total PlGF did not differ between women with no preeclampsia, preeclampsia, and hemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome (354 versus 435 versus 344pg/mL), whereas it was markedly elevated in AFLP compared with all groups (2054 pg/mL, P<0.0001). Furthermore, in AFLP, both sFlt-1 and total PlGF declined rapidly postdelivery, with significantly higher predelivery total PlGF (n=12; median, 2054 pg/mL) than postpartum levels (n=14; median, 163pg/mL, P<0.0001), suggesting that in AFLP, PlGF is largely placenta-derived. Collectively, our findings indicate that like sFlt-1, PlGF production is significantly upregulated in AFLP, mainly originating from the placenta. Importantly, total PlGF can now be easily calculated from already available free PlGF and sFlt-1 levels, allowing subsequent evaluation of other groups in whom PlGF is altered.","Neuman, Rugina I.; Saleh, Langeza; Verdonk, Koen; van den Meiracker, Anton H.; Russcher, Henk; Metselaar, Herold J.; Visser, Willy; Danser, A.H.

METHODS: We performed an observational cross-sectional study on 520 consecutive patients with essential hypertension taking a stable triple therapy in whom 24-h ambulatory BP was evaluated. Both number of pills and antihypertensive treatment intensity (ATI), as possible pharmacological predictors of ambulatory BP control, were taken into account. RESULTS: A total of 189 (36.3%) patients were taking triple therapy with ACEi and 331 (63.7%) patients were taking triple therapy with ARB. Mean age was 62.7 ± 12.2 years. Patients on triple therapy with ACEi had a significantly lower ATI and took fewer antihypertensive pills than patients on triple therapy with ARB (22.2% of patients took a single-pill triple fixed-dose combination). Patients taking triple therapy with ACEi had higher prevalence of both 24-h (54.8% vs 44.0%; p = 0.019) and daytime BP control (61.8% vs 49.2%; p = 0.006) than patients taking triple therapy with ARB, even after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking habit, type 2 diabetes mellitus, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and ATI [OR 1.5 (95% CI 1.1–2.2) and OR 1.6 (95% CI 1.1–2.4), respectively]. However, these independent associations with ambulatory BP control were lost when the number of antihypertensive pills was included in the model. CONCLUSION: The higher prevalence of ambulatory BP control found in patients taking a triple therapy with ACEi was affected by the lower number of antihypertensive pills taken, which was also the key predictor of ambulatory BP control in our study. This confirms the importance of fixed-dose combinations in the management of essential hypertension.","Sarzani, Riccardo; Giulietti, Federico; Filipponi, Andrea; Marziali, Sonia; Ristori, Letizia; Buscarini, Silvia; Garbuglia, Caterina; Biondini, Simone; Allevi, Massimiliano; Spannella, Francesco",Adv Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8279975/,12

Participants rated their healthcare experiences during their child’s visits to five types of healthcare settings common for inherited metabolic diseases: the metabolic clinic, the emergency department, hospital inpatient units, the blood laboratory, and the pharmacy. Participants provided narrative descriptions of any memorable negative or positive experiences. RESULTS: There were 248 respondents (response rate 49%). Caregivers were generally very or somewhat satisfied with the care provided at each care setting. Appropriate treatment, provider knowledge, provider communication, and care coordination were deemed essential aspects of satisfaction with care by the majority of participants across many settings. Memorable negative experiences were reported by 8–22% of participants, varying by setting. Among participants who reported memorable negative experiences, contributing factors included providers’ demeanor, lack of communication, lack of involvement of the family, and disregard of an emergency protocol letter provided by the family. CONCLUSIONS: While caregivers’ satisfaction with care for children with inherited metabolic diseases was high, we identified gaps in family-centered care and factors contributing to negative experiences that are important to consider in the future development of strategies to improve pediatric care for inherited metabolic diseases.

19405,Seaweed Components as Potential Modulators of the Gut Microbiota,2021-06-23,"The presence of mycotoxins in foodstuffs and feedstuffs is a serious concern for human health. The detection of mycotoxins is therefore necessary as a preventive action to avoid the harmful contamination of foodstuffs and animal feed. In comparison with the considerable expense of treating contaminated foodstuffs, early detection is a cost-effective way to ensure food safety. The high affinity of bio-recognition molecules to mycotoxins has led to the development of affinity columns for sample pre-treatment and the development of biosensors for the quantitative analysis of mycotoxins. Aptamers are a very attractive class of biological receptors that are currently in great demand for the development of new biosensors. In this review, the improvement in the materials and methodology, and the working principles and performance of both conventional and recently developed methods are discussed. The key features and applications of the fundamental recognition elements, such as antibodies and aptamers are addressed. Recent advances in aptasensors that are based on different electrochemical (EC) transducers are reviewed in detail, especially from the perspective of the diagnostic mechanism; in addition, a brief introduction of some commercially available mycotoxin detection kits is provided.","Ong, Jing Yi; Pike, Andrew; Tan, Ling Ling",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8307942/,12

20385,cAMP Compartmentalization in Cerebrovascular Endothelial Cells: New Therapeutic Opportunities in Alzheimer’s Disease,2021-07-31,"Anabolic–androgenic steroids (AASs) are a group of synthetic molecules derived from testosterone and its precursors. AASs are widely used illicitly by adolescents and athletes, especially by bodybuilders; AASs are among the most used drugs for improving physical performance, as well as for aesthetic purposes. The use of AASs by professional and recreational athletes is increasing worldwide. This review focused on deaths related to AAS abuse and to investigation of the autopsy results and histopathological findings using a rigorous methodology protocol covering: a complete autopsy, histological analysis, and a broad toxicological investigation. Moreover, we aimed to define an investigative diagnostic protocol supporting forensic pathologists during the post-mortem investigation of AAS abusers. This review was conducted using PubMed Central and Google Scholar databases to find articles published between 1 January 1968 and 30 June 2021, using the following key terms: “(anabolic-androgenic steroids) AND (autopsy); (anabolic-androgenic steroids) AND (forensic)”. A total of 939 articles were screened and 926 did not meet the inclusion criteria. In conclusion, 14 articles were included in this systematic review, reporting 137 fatal cases of AAS abuse in total. The histopathologic studies showed myocardial damage characterized by myocyte hypertrophy, focal myocyte damage with myofibrillar loss, interstitial fibrosis, mostly subepicardial, and small vessel disease. Indeed, in AAS-related cases, autopsy plays a pivotal role in the study of AAS adverse effects and organ damage related to their use or abuse. This systematic review aimed to define a specific workflow in death cases related to AASs, suggesting important future insights to better clarify sudden deaths related to AASs, such as the use of miRNAs. The forensic community needs a unified approach in cases of suspected death related to the use of AASs. There are several occasions to apply this workflow, for example in cases of death of bodybuilders and of young people who die in gymnasiums or during sports activities.","Esposito, Massimiliano; Licciardello, Gabriele; Privitera, Federico; Iannuzzi, Salvatore; Liberto, Aldo; Sessa, Francesco; Salerno, Monica",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8393338/,12
20416,"HFE Genotype, Ferritin Levels and Transferrin Saturation in Patients with Suspected Hereditary Hemochromatosis",2021-07-28,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Osteosarcoma is a rare type of cancer with poor prognoses. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no mathematical models that study the impact of chemotherapy treatments on the osteosarcoma microenvironment. In this study, we developed a data driven mathematical model to analyze the dynamics of the important players in three groups of osteosarcoma tumors with distinct immune patterns in the presence of the most common chemotherapy drugs. The results indicate that the treatments’ start times and optimal dosages depend on the unique growth rate of the tumor, which implies the necessity of personalized medicine. Furthermore, the developed model can be extended by others to build models that can recommend individual-specific optimal dosages. ABSTRACT: Since all tumors are unique, they may respond differently to the same treatments. Therefore, it is necessary to study their characteristics individually to find their best treatment options. We built a mathematical model for the interactions between the most common chemotherapy drugs and the osteosarcoma microenvironments of three clusters of tumors with unique immune profiles. We then investigated the effects of chemotherapy with different treatment regimens and various treatment start times on the behaviors of immune and cancer cells in each cluster. Saliently, we suggest the optimal drug dosages for the tumors in each cluster. The results show that abundances of dendritic cells and HMGB1 increase when drugs are given and decrease when drugs are absent. Populations of helper T cells, cytotoxic cells, and IFN- [Formula: see text] grow, and populations of cancer cells and other immune cells shrink during treatment. According to the model, the MAP regimen does a good job at killing cancer, and is more effective than doxorubicin and cisplatin combined or methotrexate alone. The results also indicate that it is important to consider the tumor’s unique growth rate when deciding the treatment details, as fast growing tumors need early treatment start times and high dosages.","Le, Trang; Su, Sumeyye; Shahriyari, Leili",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8394778/,12

20474,No Metagenomic Evidence of Causative Viral Pathogens in Postencephalitic Parkinsonism Following Encephalitis Lethargica,2021-08-12,"Survival analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset is a well-known method for discovering gene expression-based prognostic biomarkers of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). A cutoff point is usually used in survival analysis for patient dichotomization when using continuous gene expression values. There is some optimization software for cutoff determination. However, the software’s predetermined cutoffs are usually set at the medians or quantiles of gene expression values. There are also few clinicopathological features available in pre-processed datasets. We applied an in-house workflow, including data retrieving and pre-processing, feature selection, sliding-window cutoff selection, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazard modeling for biomarker discovery. In our approach for the TCGA HNSCC cohort, we scanned human protein-coding genes to find optimal cutoff values. After adjustments with confounders, clinical tumor stage and surgical margin involvement were found to be independent risk factors for prognosis. According to the results tables that show hazard ratios with Bonferroni-adjusted p values under the optimal cutoff, three biomarker candidates, CAMK2N1, CALML5, and FCGBP, are significantly associated with overall survival. We validated this discovery by using the another independent HNSCC dataset (GSE65858). Thus, we suggest that transcriptomic analysis could help with biomarker discovery. Moreover, the robustness of the biomarkers we identified should be ensured through several additional tests with independent datasets.","Chi, Li-Hsing; Wu, Alexander T.

20512,Recent Advances in the Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Plant-Derived Alkaloid Rhynchophylline in Neurological and Cardiovascular Diseases,2021-07-29,"The blood–brain barrier (BBB) plays a vital role in the protection and maintenance of homeostasis in the brain. In this way, it is an interesting target as an interface for various types of drug delivery, specifically in the context of the treatment of several neuropathological conditions where the therapeutic agents cannot cross the BBB. Drug toxicity and on-target specificity are among some of the limitations associated with current neurotherapeutics. In recent years, advances in nanodrug delivery have enabled the carrier system containing the active therapeutic drug to target the signaling pathways and pathophysiology that are closely linked to central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), multiple sclerosis (MS), brain tumor, epilepsy, ischemic stroke, and neurodegeneration. At present, among the nano formulations, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have emerged as a putative drug carrier system that can deliver the active therapeutics (drug-loaded SLNs) across the BBB at the target site of the brain, offering a novel approach with controlled drug delivery, longer circulation time, target specificity, and higher efficacy, and more importantly, reducing toxicity in a biomimetic way. This paper highlights the synthesis and application of SLNs as a novel nontoxic formulation strategy to carry CNS drugs across the BBB to improve the use of therapeutics agents in treating major neurological disorders in future clinics.","Satapathy, Mantosh Kumar; Yen, Ting-Lin; Jan, Jing-Shiun; Tang, Ruei-Dun; Wang, Jia-Yi; Taliyan, Rajeev; Yang, Chih-Hao",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8402065/,12

20652,A quality optimization approach to image Achilles tendon microstructure by phase-contrast enhanced synchrotron micro-tomography,2021-08-27,"BACKGROUND: Stroke results in varying physical, cognitive, emotional and/or social disabilities in the short and long term alike. Motor impairments are important, persistent consequences of stroke and include, among others, decreased respiratory muscle function, decreased ability to expand the thorax and postural dysfunction. These deficits affect the patient’s ability to perform daily activities, produce fatigue and reduce endurance and quality of life. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) aims to improve the strength and endurance of the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles. The objectives of this study are to investigate the effect of 3 weeks of IMT on (i) maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) in adults having suffered a stroke, as well as (ii) functional activities and expiratory measurements. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing IMT with conventional neurorehabilitation (usual practice). The trial will include 80 patients with reduced MIP hospitalised at a specialised neurorehabilitation hospital in Denmark. The intervention group will receive IMT sessions, exercising at 30% of MIP. Patients in the intervention group will perform two daily sessions (one session of IMT with Threshold IMT consisting of two times 15 inspirations at normal breathing rhythm (5–10 min)), 7 days a week for 3 weeks. Training can be with or without physiotherapist supervision. Study outcomes: MIP assessed by the Power Breath, Functional Independence Measurement, The 6-min walk test, the Fatigue Severity Scale and average voice volume. Expiratory function will be assessed using spirometry. All assessments will be conducted at baseline and 3 weeks (at termination of the intervention) and 3 months after the intervention has concluded. DISCUSSION: IMT is a promising and partly self-managed tool for rehabilitation to improve respiratory function. The introduction of IMT in combination with traditional physical therapy may enhance faster recovery after stroke and may at the same time demand little personnel resources to increase training intensity. This trial will provide further evidence of IMT to clinicians, patients and health managers. Hereby, this study accepts the call for further research.

We hypothesized that SLPC could predict fluid responsiveness better than stroke volume variation (SVV) in mechanically ventilated intensive care patients. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, stroke volume index (SVI) and SVV were recorded before SLPC, during SLPC and before and after 500 mL fluid loading. Patients whose SVI increased more than 15% after the fluid loading were defined as fluid responders. Reciever operating characteristics (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the abilities of the methods to predict fluid responsiveness. Fifty-five patients completed the study. Twenty-five (46%) of them were responders. Decrease percentage in SVI during SLPC (SVIΔ%–SLPC) was 11.6 ± 5.2% and 4.3 ± 2.2% in responders and non-responders, respectively (p < 0.001). A good correlation was found between SVIΔ%–SLPC and percentage change in SVI after fluid loading (r = 0.728, P < 0.001). Areas under the ROC curves (ROC–AUC) of SVIΔ%–SLPC and SVV were 0.951 (95% CI 0.857–0.991) and 0.747 (95% CI 0.611–0.854), respectively. The ROC–AUC of SVIΔ%–SLPC was significantly higher than that of SVV (p = 0.0045). The best cut-off value of SVIΔ%–SLPC was 7.5% with 90% sensitivity and 96% specificity. The percentage change in SVI during SLPC predicts fluid responsiveness in intensive care patients who are ventilated with low tidal volumes; the sensitivity and specificity values are higher than those of SVV.","Abdullah, Taner; Ali, Achmet; Saka, Esra; Canbaz, Mert; Gokduman, Ceren; Polat, Ozlem; Esen, Figen; Orhan Sungur, Mukadder",J Clin Monit Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8412862/,12

However, why human thyroid function varies between populations, individuals, and across the lifespan has attracted little research to date. This limits our ability to evaluate the conditions under which patterns of variation in thyroid function are best understood as ‘normal’ or ‘pathological’. In this review, we aim to spark interest in research aimed at understanding the causes of variation in thyroid phenotypes. We start by assessing the biomedical literature on thyroid imbalance to discuss the validity of existing reference intervals for diagnosis and treatment across individuals and populations. We then propose an evolutionary ecological framework for understanding the phylogenetic, genetic, ecological, developmental, and physiological causes of normal variation in thyroid function. We build on this approach to suggest testable predictions for how environmental challenges interact with individual circumstances to influence the onset of thyroid disorders. We propose that dietary changes, ecological disruptions of co-evolutionary processes during pregnancy and with pathogens, emerging infections, and exacerbated stress responses can contribute to explaining the onset of thyroid diseases. For patients to receive the best personalized care, research into the causes of thyroid variation at multiple levels is needed.","Keestra, Sarai; Högqvist Tabor, Vedrana; Alvergne, Alexandra",Evol Med Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8454515/,12

The current work is to investigate the effect and possible mechanism of Uncaria rhynchophylla (UR) on thioacetamide- (TAA-) induced ALI in rats. UR (100 and 200 mg/kg) was orally administrated with TAA (200 mg/kg of bodyweight, intraperitoneal injection) for 3 consecutive days. ALI was confirmed using histological examination and the factors associated with OS and liver function activity measured in serum. Moreover, expressions of inflammation and collagen-related proteins were measured by the Western blot analysis. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), which mediates OS in the ALI control group, was manifested by a significant rise compared with the normal group. UR significantly reduced AST, ALT, and ammonia levels in serum. The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation induced by TAA led to increase both inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Whereas, UR administration remarkably suppressed such an overexpression. UR supplementation improved matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP-1, -2, and -8. In contrast, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases- (TIMP-) 1 level increased significantly by UR treatment. In addition, the histopathological analysis showed that the liver tissue lesions were improved obviously by UR treatment. UR may ameliorate the effects of TAA-induced ALI in rats by suppressing both OS through MPO activation and proinflammatory factors through NF-κB activation. In conclusion, UR exhibited a potent hepatoprotective effect on ALI through the suppression of OS.","Shin, Mi-Rae; Kim, Min Ju; Lee, Jin A; Roh, Seong-Soo",Can J Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8455208/,12

21613,Comparison of the transcriptome in circulating leukocytes in early lactation between primiparous and multiparous cows provides evidence for age-related changes,2021-09-25,"Apathy is a neuropsychiatric symptom observed in different neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although apathy is considered a symptom, it has been recently reconsidered as a syndrome characterised by three dimensions: cognitive symptoms, affective symptoms and behavioural symptoms. Recent studies have shown that apathy can be considered as a prodromal symptom of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but also an indicator of the transition from mild cognitive impairment to AD. According to this scenario, an early detection of apathy in subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Mild AD can be a valid psychometric strategy to improve an early diagnosis and promote a prompt intervention. The Apathy Evaluation Scale is a validated tool composed of 18 items that assess and quantify emotional, behavioural and cognitive aspects of apathy. The aim of this study is to assess the specific reliability and validity of the Italian version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale—Clinician Version (AES-C) to detect apathy both in amnestic MCI and mild AD patients. In the present paper, we therefore examined the psychometric properties and the invariance of the Italian Version of the AES-C conducted on a sample composed of an experimental group of amnestic MCI and AD patients (N = 107) and a control group (N = 107) constituted by Age- and Sex-matched healthy controls. Results confirm the goodness of the scale. Confirmatory factory analysis confirmed that the AES-C Italian Version presents the same stability of one second-order factor and three first-order factors identified in the original version, and all items are predicted by a single general factor. Moreover, the scale was found to be invariant across both populations. Moreover, reliability and discriminant analysis showed good values. We found in the experimental group a negative correlation between the AES-C and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) (rs = −0.21, p < 0.001) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (rs = −0.04, p < 0.001), while a positive correlation was found between the AES-C and Hamilton psychiatric Rating scale for Depression (HAM-D) scores (rs = 0.58, p < 0.001) Overall, our data demonstrated the validity of the Italian version of the AES-C for the assessment of apathy both in MCI and in AD patients.","Furneri, Giovanna; Platania, Silvia; Privitera, Alessandra; Martelli, Federica; Smeriglio, Rossana; Razza, Grazia; Maci, Tiziana; Castellano, Sabrina; Drago, Filippo; Santagati, Mario; Caponnetto, Pasquale; Caraci, Filippo; Di Nuovo, Santo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8467636/,12

Complications of ARF, especially its cardiac complications (cardiorenal syndrome type 3, CRS-3), are the main causes of death in patients with ARF. However, the shortage and limited efficacy of therapeutic drugs make it significant to establish new large-scale drug screening models. Based on the Nitroreductase/Metronidazole (NTR/MTZ) cell ablation system, we constructed a Tg(cdh17:Dendra2-NTR) transgenic zebrafish line, which can specifically ablate renal tubular epithelial cells. The absence of renal tubular epithelial cells can lead to ARF in zebrafish larvae. The ARF symptoms, such as heart enlargement, slow heart rate and blood stasis, are similar to the clinical manifestations of human CRS-3. Furthermore, two therapeutic drugs (digoxin and enalapril) commonly used in the clinical treatment of heart failure were also effective in alleviating the symptoms of CRS-3 in zebrafish, which proved the effectiveness of this model. Drug screening further discovered a potential drug candidate, α-lipoic acid, which can effectively alleviate the symptoms of CRS-3 through its antioxidant function. Accordingly, we established a new ARF model of zebrafish, which laid a foundation for large-scale screening of new therapeutic drugs for its complications.","Liao, Shuyi; Yang, Wenmin; Yu, Ting; Dai, Lu; Liu, Xiaoliang; Zhang, Jiangping; Zhao, Jinghong; Liu, Chi",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8469377/,12
21745,P80 Natural Essence Exerts Efficient Anti-HIV-1- as Well as Adjuvant Effects in DCs,2021-08-31,"The first concepts for reproducing human systemic organismal biology in vitro were developed over 12 years ago. Such concepts, then called human- or body-on-a-chip, claimed that microphysiological systems would become the relevant technology platform emulating the physiology and morphology of human organisms at the smallest biologically acceptable scale in vitro and, therefore, would enable the selection of personalized therapies for any patient at unprecedented precision. Meanwhile, the first human organoids—stem cell-derived complex three-dimensional organ models that expand and self-organize in vitro—have proven that in vitro self-assembly of minute premature human organ-like structures is feasible, once the respective stimuli of ontogenesis are provided to human stem cells. Such premature organoids can precisely reflect a number of distinct physiological and pathophysiological features of their respective counterparts in the human body. We now develop the human-on-a-chip concepts of the past into an organismoid theory. We describe the current concept and principles to create a series of organismoids—minute, mindless and emotion-free physiological in vitro equivalents of an individual's mature human body—by an artificially short process of morphogenetic self-assembly mimicking an individual's ontogenesis from egg cell to sexually mature organism. Subsequently, we provide the concept and principles to maintain such an individual's set of organismoids at a self-sustained functional healthy homeostasis over very long time frames in vitro. Principles how to perturb a subset of healthy organismoids by means of the natural or artificial induction of diseases are enrolled to emulate an individual's disease process. Finally, we discuss using such series of healthy and perturbed organismoids in predictively selecting, scheduling and dosing an individual patient's personalized therapy or medicine precisely. The potential impact of the organismoid theory on our healthcare system generally and the rapid adoption of disruptive personalized T-cell therapies particularly is highlighted.","Marx, Uwe; Accastelli, Enrico; David, Rhiannon; Erfurth, Hendrik; Koenig, Leopold; Lauster, Roland; Ramme, Anja Patricia; Reinke, Petra; Volk, Hans-Dieter; Winter, Annika; Dehne, Eva-Maria",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473633/,12

Technological innovation was of pivotal importance for the extensive clinical and scientific interest in CCTA. Recently, the advent of last generation wide-coverage CT scans paved the way for new clinical applications of this technique beyond coronary arteries anatomy evaluation. More precisely, both biventricular volume and systolic function quantification and myocardial fibrosis identification appeared to be feasible with last generation CT. In the present review we would focus on potential applications of cardiac computed tomography (CCT), beyond CCTA, for a comprehensive assessment patients with newly diagnosed cardiomyopathy, from technical requirements to novel clinical applications.","Conte, Edoardo; Mushtaq, Saima; Muscogiuri, Giuseppe; Formenti, Alberto; Annoni, Andrea; Mancini, Elisabetta; Ricci, Francesca; Melotti, Eleonora; Gigante, Carlo; Lorenza, Zanotto; Guglielmo, Marco; Baggiano, Andrea; Maragna, Riccardo; Giacari, Carlo Maria; Carbucicchio, Corrado; Catto, Valentina; Pepi, Mauro; Andreini, Daniele; Pontone, Gianluca",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8476802/,12

We present KwARG, which implements a parsimony-based greedy heuristic algorithm for finding plausible genealogical histories (ancestral recombination graphs) that are minimal or near-minimal in the number of posited recombination and mutation events. RESULTS: Given an input dataset of aligned sequences, KwARG outputs a list of possible candidate solutions, each comprising a list of mutation and recombination events that could have generated the dataset; the relative proportion of recombinations and recurrent mutations in a solution can be controlled via specifying a set of ‘cost’ parameters. We demonstrate that the algorithm performs well when compared against existing methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software is available at https://github.com/a-ignatieva/kwarg.

As a result, the sensors record large amounts of data, making it very difficult to process in real-/semi-real-time using the conventional processing routines. We present a novel approach, based on deep learning, for handling the large amounts of DAS data in real-/semi-real-time. The proposed neural network was trained on synthetic microseismic data contaminated with real-ambient noise from field data and was validated using field DAS microseismic data obtained from a hydraulic fracturing operation. The results indicate that the trained network is capable of detecting and locating microseismic events from DAS data and simultaneously update the velocity model to a high degree of precision. The mean absolute errors in the event locations and the velocity model parameters are 2.04, 0.72, 2.76, 4.19 and 0.97 percent for distance (x), depth (z), P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity and density, respectively. In addition to automation and computational efficiency, deep learning reduces human expert data handling during processing, thus preserving data integrity leading to more accurate and reproducible results.","Wamriew, Daniel; Pevzner, Roman; Maltsev, Evgenii; Pissarenko, Dimitri",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8512364/,12
22555,All Hands on Deck: Transdisciplinary Approaches to Emerging Infectious Disease,2005-11-10,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory illnesses are the leading cause of death from infectious diseases around the world, and occasional outbreaks of particularly virulent strains are can be public health disasters. Recently, a large outbreak of fatal Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) occurred following a single patient exposure in the emergency department (ED) of the Samsung Medical Center, a tertiary-care hospital in South Korea, which resulted in significant public health and economic burden. After this outbreak, a febrile respiratory infectious disease unit (FRIDU) with a negative pressure ventilation system was constructed outside the emergency department (ED) in 2015, to screen for patients with contagious diseases requiring isolation. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who visited the ED with febrile illness between August 2015 and July 2016. Ultimately, 1562 patients who were hospitalized after FRIDU screening were analyzed. The level of isolation recommended during their screening at the FRIDU was compared with the level deemed appropriate given their final diagnosis. RESULTS: Of the 1562 patients screened at the FRIDU, 198 (13%) were isolated, 194 (12%) were reverse isolated, and 1170 (75%) were not isolated. While hospitalized, 97 patients (6%) were confirmed to have a contagious disease requiring isolation, such as tuberculosis; 207 patients (13%) were confirmed to be immunocompromised and to require reverse isolation, mainly due to neutropenia; and the remaining 1258 patients (81%) did not require isolation. The correlation coefficient for isolation consistency was 0.565 (P < 0.001). No serious nosocomial outbreaks of contagious diseases occurred. During FRIDU screening, 114 patients were admitted to the resuscitation zone due to clinical instability, and three of these patients died. CONCLUSION: The initial isolation levels resulting from FRIDU screening were moderately well correlated with the isolation levels required by the final diagnosis, demonstrating the utility of pre-hospitalization screening units. However, the risks of deterioration during the screening process remain challenges.

Establishment of an efficient and sensitive diagnostic system of SARS-CoV genetic materials is crucial for SARS control. In this study, we quantified SARS-CoV mRNAs in both infected cell culture lysate and in supernatant by using Real-time quantitative revere transcription-PCR based on EvaGreen™ dye and Taqman-MGB probes. For extensive evaluation of sensitivities and specificities, 13 pairs of primers and 4 probes were designed based on different genes of SARS-CoV. Glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was selected as the internal control gene. Results showed that S-gene-specific PCR was the most sensitive for detection, but because of its sequence variability in the different viral strains, primers and a probe based on the N gene were suitable substitutions. Meanwhile, we found the mRNA concentrations in cell culture lysates were much higher than in cell supernatant and facilited more sensitive detection of the SARS-CoV.","Xu, Li-li; Hu, Zhi-hong; Wang, Hua-lin; Han, Xiao; Deng, Fei",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090980/,12

GIS/GPS-assisted methods provide a promising alternative, but these methods need further improvement. We established a stratified 3-stage GIS/GPS-assisted sampling method in which residential areas of a target population are divided into mutually exclusive cells – geographic units (geounits) as the primary sampling frame (PSF). Geounits with residential households were randomly selected from the PSF with a semi-automatic algorithm implemented in R. Novel methods were used to sample households and participants. Simulations and application studies indicated adequate feasibility, efficiency and validity of the method in sampling rural-to-urban migrants from a large city with complex residential arrangements. With this method, researchers can determine sample size and number of geounits, households and participants to be sampled; optimally allocate geounits; determine area size of sampled geounits and estimate sample weights; and complete sampling for field data collection in a short period. Our method adds an integrative approach for GIS/GPS-assisted random sampling with a de facto population assumption.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank are two dominant actors in health and development. Each espouses a different ideal of health as it relates to the process of development. The WHO defines health as a human right, and focuses on health outcomes as inputs to and the result of development. The World Bank’s approach to development focuses largely on macro-economic growth as input to human capabilities. The World Bank became a leading actor in international health policy in the 1990s when it operationalized health as an outcome of financial and health care systems. This chapter looks at programming efforts by the WHO and the World Bank to foster development via investment in health or through macro-economic adjustment. Results are mixed. Efforts to improve primary care were successful in improving health outcomes of children under five, but made little impact on maternal mortality. Structural adjustment programs achieved moderate success with medium- to long-term economic growth but increased health inequities.

The problem of infection is dynamic with continued shifts in pathogenic organisms and microbial susceptibilities, new treatment regimens that further diminish immune function, and patients receiving treatment who are now older and frailer. The classic patterns of immunodeficiency for patients with a hematological malignancy include: periods of profound neutropenia, increased iatrogenic risks (i.e., central vascular catheters), and cellular immune suppression that affects HSCT recipients, patients with lymphoid malignancies, and those receiving treatment with corticosteroids or agents like alemtuzumab [1–4]. Recent advances in antimicrobial drug development, new technology, clinical trial results, and further clinical experience have enhanced the database on which to make infection prophylaxis and treatment decisions.

This chapter attempts to provide an overview of the disease, beginning with the pathogenesis and its protean clinical presentations. It also discusses the recent evolution of molecular methods that have lately provided an impetus to early diagnosis with a clear opportunity to unmask drug resistance before initiating “blind”, potentially ineffective, and sometimes harmful treatment with standard therapy. The chapter also provides insight into tuberculosis in special situations, and discusses briefly the treatments in uncomplicated cases as well as in special situations, and in instances of drug resistance. Preventive methods including current and upcoming vaccines are mentioned.

In bacterial meningitis, abnormal and asymmetrical enhancement of the leptomeninges and the subarachnoid space is typical. Initial neuroimaging has to rule out infectious foci of the skull base such as purulent sinusitis or mastoiditis. In patients with focal deficits or seizures, MRI is the tool of choice to diagnose vascular or septic complications. Neoplastic, viral, or fungal infections of the CNS may present with similar changes of the meninges; however, fungal meningitis normally causes a thicker and more nodular enhancement. In case of basal accentuation of the leptomeningeal contrast enhancement and conspicuous signal changes in the basal cisterns, one has to consider tuberculous meningitis for differential diagnosis, especially in patients with HIV infection.

25647,Heat Shock Proteins in Inflammation,2007,"Evidenze epidemiologiche molecolari indicano che il DNA di almeno uno dei 15 tipi oncogeni di Papillomavirus umano (HPV) viene rilevato virtualmente in tutte le lesioni carcinomatose e che l’infezione persistente da HPV ad alto-rischio è la causa necessaria ma non sufficiente per il processo carcinogenico. Sebbene il rilevamento di DNA di HPV in tutte le lesioni cancerose non sia prova definitiva del suo ruolo causale nella carcinogenesi, è stato valutato che il rischio relativo di cancro associato con i genotipi oncogeni di HPV è addirittura più alto del rischio di carcinoma polmonare associato con il fumo. In natura sono stati identificati più di 120 genotipi di HPV, di cui circa 40 possono infettare il tratto genitale; di questi, 15 sono fortemente associati al cancro della cervice. Il meccanismo biologico di trasformazione maligna è stato ben caratterizzato. In sintesi, il potenziale oncogenico di questi virus è legato ai geni virali E6 e E7. La oncoproteina virale E6 inizia la degradazione della proteina anti-oncogenica (p53), mentre la oncoproteina virale E7 porta all’inattivazione di un’altra proteina di soppressione tumorale (RB). Questi effetti sinergici sono passaggi importanti della carcinogenesi in quanto danno luogo alla perdita del controllo del ciclo cellulare. Sulla base della loro presenza in lesioni benigne o maligne della cervice, questi virus sono stati definiti come HPVs a basso, medio od alto rischio oncogeno. Gli HPV vengono tipicamente trasmessi nelle donne entro pochi anni dall’inizio della loro attività sessuale e, prevalentemente, sono causa di infezioni transitorie e clinicamente irrilevanti che nella maggior parte dei casi si risolvono spontaneamente senza alcuna conseguenza patologica e con cambiamenti citologici temporanei. Fortunatamente, a seguito dell’infezione primaria, soltanto una minoranza di donne mantiene una infezione persistente (circa il 10% dopo 5 anni) ed è questo gruppo più piccolo che ha un sostanziale rischio (più del 50%) di sviluppare lesioni precancerose ad alta malignità (HSIL) o, in assenza di uno screening efficace, il carcinoma della cervice (CC) uterina.",,Carcinoma della cervice uterina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122310/,12

A number of associated events or conditions are strongly associated with the risk for developing BOS; these include acute rejection, gastroesophageal reflux, infections, and autoimmune reactions that can occur in the setting of alloimmune responses to the lung allograft as recipients are given intense immunosuppression to prevent allograft rejection. The term chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is being increasingly used to refer to recipients with late allograft dysfunction that meets the spirometric criteria for the diagnosis of BOS, but clinicians should recognize that such dysfunction can occur for a variety of reasons other than BOS. The recently identified entity of restrictive allograft syndrome, which is now recognized as a relatively distinct phenotype of CLAD, has features that differentiate it from classic obstructive BOS. A number of other entities that can also significantly affect allograft function must also be considered when significant allograft dysfunction is encountered following lung transplantation.","Meyer, Keith C.; Glanville, Allan R.",Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome in Lung Transplantation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122385/,12

The recent emergence, host expansion, and spread of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 subtype in Asia has heightened concerns globally, both in regards to mortality of HPAI H5N1 in humans and the potential of a new pandemic. In response, many agencies and organizations have been working collaboratively to develop early detection systems, preparedness plans, and objectives for further research. As a result, there has been a large influx of published information regarding potential risk, surveillance, prevention and control of highly pathogenic avian influenza, particularly in regards to animal to human and subsequent human to human transmission.

25897,Danger in Paradise,2017-08-25,"The search for effective pain relief has been ever present across human history. The discovery of opium’s ability to relieve pain stimulated the refinement of opium and generation of synthetic analogues to create more effective, potent, and faster-acting analgesics. The social and economic value of opioids has remained high not only due to their demonstrated efficiency in mitigating pain but also their noteworthy ability to reliably produce rewarding psychological effects. Consequently, at various times during the past several hundred years, opioids have sparked wars, fueled black markets and cartel crime, and triggered numerous opioid addiction and overdose death epidemics around the world. The increased therapeutic desire to address pain together with pharmaceutical discoveries in medication design, rapid manufacture, and highly effective opioid marketing and distribution has led more recently to increased availability and accessibility to potent prescription opioids, which has sparked the deadliest overdose crisis in human history. This chapter describes the etiology and epidemiology of the opioid crisis using public health and Health Belief Model frameworks and reviews approaches that have been applied to address supply (e.g., overprescribing) and demand (e.g., medication treatments) sides of the equation. Causes of the growth and spread of the overdose epidemic are analyzed as a way to inform a successful end to the current crisis as well as to prevent future epidemics.","Kelly, John F.; Wakeman, Sarah E.",Treating Opioid Addiction,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122616/,12

With the advent of recombinant DNA technology, it became possible to manufacture bioactive recombinant proteins for medicinal use. Since the approval of recombinant human G-CSF (rHuG-CSF), such as filgrastim in 1991 and pegfilgrastim in 2002, millions of patients at risk for severe myelosuppression have received these products. Overall, filgrastim and pegfilgrastim have a high margin of safety for short-term use; however, rare severe adverse events have emerged and questions remain regarding the long-term safety and consequences of use of these products. This chapter primarily focuses on the safety and adverse event profile of the most widely used commercially available rHuG-CSF, Neupogen (filgrastim) and Neulasta [a modified (pegylated) filgrastim, pegfilgrastim].

For example, we, as opposed to many other mentioned readers, consider a symbiont as an organism living in an association with another regardless of whether it causes a pathologic response or not, but from our title, the reader may incorrectly infer that we consider a parasite to be different from a symbiont. A symbiont is an organism that uses another organism as a habitat. This chapter discusses the primary associations and associated conflicts involving the terminology. It also provides both differentiation between and conflicting views regarding the interpretation of the terms “infect” and “infest,” “infection” and “disease,” and other terms. Many seemingly harmless symbionts of a wide array of taxonomic groups are triggered to become pathogenic or virulent, and we provide several examples of the provoking (stimulating) triggers, with the understanding that in most cases, the conditions for the triggered activities are much more complex and complicated than presented. Examples of triggers follow: environmental ones like temperature, toxic chemicals (dose), chemotherapeutics, dietary changes, and geographic habits; internal ones like host site, host resistance or susceptibility, and host modifications; and combinations of these and other conditions. We provide examples involving multiple triggers for organisms associated with termites, for an endemic virus being affected by multiple factors and having multiple effects on its commercial penaeid shrimp hosts, and for contrasting variables associated with two exotic viruses in wild and cultured commercial penaeid shrimps with an emphasis on hypothesizing how the pathogenicity developed in these two viruses. The chapter ends by trying to answer the question of why would a symbiont become pathogenic in some hosts and not in others from an evolutionary perspective. It uses two hypotheses to explain the increased virulence.","Overstreet, Robin M.; Lotz, Jeffrey M.",The Rasputin Effect: When Commensals and Symbionts Become Parasitic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123458/,12

One of the disturbing hallmarks of the novel A/H1N1 flu virus is that it produces severe lung damage resulting in ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). Normally, patients with ARDS are placed on mechanical ventilation in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and treated with a variety of pharmacological agents to reduce infection and lung inflammation. With A/H1N1 viral pneumonia, mechanical ventilation often does not result in adequate oxygenation so with ECMO the burden of pumping and oxygenating the blood is taken from the heart and lungs, and they are given time to heal. San Matteo Polyclinic Hospital was nominated by the Lombardy Region and the Ministry of Health as national reference for the installation of ECMO to deal severe heart failure and pulmonary caused by novel A/H1N1 flu virus. Clinical Engineering Department of the hospital had a fundamental coordination role in biomedical technology-related issues. It supported high-level management decisions (strategy, management, planning, procurement and maintenance) to answer to Lombardy’s guidelines about the organization of ECMO machines in the region.

We start from the basic concepts and models in an unstructured population and gradually increase the realism by adding the effects of realistic contact structures within a population as well as the effects of human mobility coupling different subpopulations. Building on these concepts we present two realistic data-driven epidemiological models able to forecast the spreading of infectious diseases at different geographical granularities.

26824,Social Dilemma Analysis of the Spread of Infectious Disease,2018-11-28,"Interferon was discovered by Alick Isaacs and Jean Lindenmann in 1957. It was originally thought that interferon could be used as a general anti-viral agent and in anti-cancer therapy. There are many different types of interferons, now known as interferons “alpha,” “beta,” “gamma” and “lambda,” with different cellular receptors and modes of action, and there are possibly 24 different types of alpha interferon. Independently and simultaneously, a group of Japanese scientists found an “interfering factor,” which upon subsequent analysis turned out to be interferon, probably of the alpha type. The interferon alpha gene was the first mammalian gene to be cloned in a bacterial system and became the prototype for gene cloning technology. Until the cloning of the interferons in Escherichia coli, and expression of the interferon genes in mammalian cells in culture, it was impossible to obtain enough material for clinical use. Interferon today is predominantly used in the treatment of hepatitis B and C, leukemia and Kaposi’s sarcoma. As an anti-viral agent, interferon has not lived up to its initial promise, since in vitro most viruses block the activity of interferon and clinical trials have given inconclusive results with severe side effects. Interferon induces hundreds of genes in vivo and in vitro, each interferon producing overlapping and distinct gene profiles. The mechanism of both interferon induction and anti-viral response is complicated and involves the interaction of many regulatory molecules. Interferon is now known to be a component of the large family of cytokines or interleukins.","Taylor, Milton W.",Viruses and Man: A History of Interactions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123835/,12

Developmental issues confer specific risks for medical students and residents, as well as early and late career physicians. Prevention measures which reduce exposure to workplace trauma are optimal. Physicians exposed to traumatic events will benefit from the use of prompt, evidence-based interventions. Many will seek and benefit from self-help interventions and peer support, but some may need formal assessment and treatment through employee assistance programs and traditional psychiatric care.

Nowadays, many people are increasingly utilising online social media platforms to share their feelings and moods. Despite the collective efforts in the community to develop models for identifying potential cases of mental disorders, not much work has been done to provide insights that could be used by a predictive system or a health practitioner in the elaboration of a diagnosis. In this paper, we present our research towards better visualising and understanding the factors that characterise and differentiate social media users who are affected by mental disorders from those who are not. Furthermore, we study to which extent various mental disorders, such as depression and anorexia, differ in terms of language use. We conduct different experiments considering various dimensions of language such as vocabulary, psychometric attributes and emotional indicators. Our findings reveal that positive instances of mental disorders show significant differences from control individuals in the way they write and express emotions in social media. However, there are not quantifiable differences that could be used to distinguish one mental disorder from each other.","Ríssola, Esteban Andrés; Aliannejadi, Mohammad; Crestani, Fabio",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148209/,12

29389,Prenatal Care of the Bitch and Queen,2010-09-02,"Antiviral gene therapy conveniently relies on use of rationally designed nucleic acids to disable replication of the pathogens. Popular targets for this therapy have been sequences encoding viral proteins and cellular host factors on which viruses depend for their replication. Therefore, availability of technologies that inactivate genes specifically, safely and effectively is crucial. Hence, discovery of RNA interference and advances in gene editing methods have been particularly important to the field. Gene transfer to induce prophylactic and therapeutic immunostimulation is also being developed to manage viral infections. Although promising, progress and ultimate success of antiviral gene therapy is dependent on several factors. These include overcoming problems that are generic to the field and influences of elements that are particular to specific viral infections. Viral and nonviral vectors (NVVs) have been used to deliver antiviral sequences, and both have advantages and drawbacks. Viral vectors are suited to delivering DNA-based expression cassettes, including immunostimulatory and virus-targeting sequences, whereas NVVs may be better applied to carrying therapeutic RNAs such as synthetic short interfering RNAs or mRNAs. Nonviral formulations are appealing because they cause limited immunostimulation, obviate mutagenic effects of DNA, and are amenable to easier dose control and large-scale synthesis. To date, encouraging results have been obtained in preclinical and clinical assessments of gene therapy against HIV-1, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and Ebola viruses, among others. In the long term, widespread application of antiviral gene therapy will be dependent on the technology demonstrating good efficacy and advantages over other antiviral strategies. Access to appropriate material and human resources that are required for implementation of the technologies in various settings will also be important.","Arbuthnot, Patrick",Gene Therapy for Viral Infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149688/,12

The following chapters were influenced by theoretical reflections, my life experience and my scientific training on three continents, at the universities of Antananarivo (Madagascar), Paris (France), Zürich (Switzerland) and in Mexico ( CISINAH, UAM and UNAM). The influence of these three cultures with very different historical backgrounds explains my progressively broadened understanding of the global development process. The post-colonial experiences in Africa in the 1960s, the violence left behind by the former colonial powers, and the outcome of civil wars, corruption and destruction of irreplaceable ecosystems and species forced me to understand not only the physical functioning of the human body (medicine), but also its psychological behaviour that supports or obstructs a healthy human life (psychology) and avoids environmental destruction ( ecology). My understanding of the links between the human body, the mind and the environment (anthropology) resulted first in an intuitive and later an interdisciplinary approach to these four interrelated circles (body, mind, environment and human relations). Understanding the importance of these four study subjects triggered in me a commitment to responsible scientific and sustainable behaviour towards other human beings, but also to nature.","Oswald Spring, Úrsula","Earth at Risk in the 21st Century: Rethinking Peace, Environment, Gender, and Human, Water, Health, Food, Energy Security, and Migration",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153461/,12

33657,"Respiratory System, Mediastinum, and Pleurae",2017-02-17,"Nowadays, successful software companies attain enhanced business objectives by opening their platforms to thousands of third-party providers. When developing an open platform many architectural design decisions have to be made, which are driven from the companies’ business objectives. The set of decisions results in an overwhelming design space of architectural variabilities. Until now, there are no architectural guidelines and tools that explicitly capture design variabilities of open platforms and their relation to business objectives. As a result, systematic knowledge is missing; platform providers have to fall back to ad-hoc decision-making; this bears consequences such as risks of failure and extra costs. In this paper, we present a pattern-driven approach called SecoArc to model diverse design decisions of open platforms and to analyze and compare alternative architectures with respect to business objectives. SecoArc consists of a design process, a modeling language, and an automated architectural analysis technique. It is implemented and ready-to-use in a tool. We evaluate the approach by means of a real-world case study. Results show that the approach improves the decision-making. Future platform providers can reduce risks by making informed decisions at design time.","Jazayeri, Bahar; Schwichtenberg, Simon; Küster, Jochen; Zimmermann, Olaf; Engels, Gregor",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266439/,12
33676,Pathology of Pulmonary Infection,2017-07-21,"This paper proposes a mutation testing approach for big data processing programs that follow a data flow model, such as those implemented on top of Apache Spark. Mutation testing is a fault-based technique that relies on fault simulation by modifying programs, to create faulty versions called mutants. Mutant creation is carried on by operators able to simulate specific and well identified faults. A testing process must be able to signal faults within mutants and thereby avoid having ill behaviours within a program. We propose a set of mutation operators designed for Spark programs characterized by a data flow and data processing operations. These operators model changes in the data flow and operations, to simulate faults that take into account Spark program characteristics. We performed manual experiments to evaluate the proposed mutation operators in terms of cost and effectiveness. Thereby, we show that mutation operators can contribute to the testing process, in the construction of reliable Spark programs.","de Souza Neto, João Batista; Martins Moreira, Anamaria; Vargas-Solar, Genoveva; Musicante, Martin Alejandro",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266460/,12

However, its use is still limited due to scaling issues. One way to address this is to exploit the large amounts of symmetry present in many real world designs. In this paper, we adapt partial order reduction for bounded model checking of synchronous hardware and introduce a novel technique that makes partial order reduction practical in this new domain. These approaches are largely automatic, requiring only minimal manual effort. We evaluate our technique on open-source and commercial packet mover circuits – designs containing FIFOs and arbiters.","Mann, Makai; Barrett, Clark",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7439740/,12

We study an iterated temporal and contemporaneous aggregation of N independent copies of a strongly stationary subcritical Galton–Watson branching process with regularly varying immigration having index α ∈ (0, 2). We show that limits of finite-dimensional distributions of appropriately centered and scaled aggregated partial-sum processes exist when first taking the limit as N → ∞and then the time scale n→ ∞. The limit process is an α-stable process if α ∈ (0, 1) ∪ (1, 2) and a deterministic line with slope 1 if α = 1.","Barczy, Mátyás; Nedényi, Fanni K.; Pap, Gyula",Lith Math J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7495407/,12

41082,Differences in maternal gene expression in Cesarean section delivery compared with vaginal delivery,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND: The indications for experienced aggression and violence towards doctors in children’s hospitals are increasing and are the focus of this study. They are reported in contact with parents or relatives in emotionally highly charged situations caused by their child’s illness. This empirical study investigated the extent to which experienced aggressive and violent behavior has been received by pediatricians in their everyday work in hospitals. METHODS: Data from two previously unpublished nationwide surveys in 2009 (n = 160) and 2017 (n = 190) were analyzed. Using the same questionnaire, the forms of aggressive action, such as exerting pressure, insulting, threatening physical violence, attempting to use violence and actually using violence as well as the descriptions of the associated situations were questioned. The wording of the insults and the type of threat could be specified via open questions. RESULTS: Approximately four out of five respondents said they have been the target of an aggressive action by parents or relatives. In 2017 approximately 3 out of 4 respondents (71.0%) considered the problem of aggressive behavior to be relevant to their everyday work compared to only every second respondent (51.9%) in 2009. Individual respondents reported up to 60 situations, in both survey waves at a median of 4.0 times per year. CONCLUSION: Experienced aggression and violence are often and increasingly part of everyday clinical life in the pediatric wards, ranging from insults to physical violence. Prevention strategies, such as preventive training for communication and de-escalation are explicitly desired.","Dresen, Antje; Lee, Susan; Pfaff, Holger; Weiß, Michael; Korsch, Eckhard",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7566583/,12

42649,Cerebral organoids: emerging ex vivo humanoid models of glioblastoma,2020-12-01,"In this perspective, we argue that creating the positive outcomes socio-ecological researchers and practitioners seek for urban areas requires acknowledging and addressing the interactions of race and systemic racism in parks, open and green spaces. Racial experiences are inseparable from physical landscapes and the processes of designing, managing, or studying them. From COVID-19 to the Black Lives Matter movement and protests, the events of 2020 in the United States underscore how considerations of social justice must extend beyond the conventional distributional focus of environmental justice. It must incorporate an understanding of how the built environment is racialized spatially, but not always readily quantified through the proximity-based measurements frequently used in research and practice. The perspective is organized in three main parts. The first part presents a series of vignettes to frame the ways cities and individuals participate, respond, and interact under COVID-19 with racial segregation as the backdrop. The second part suggests a stepwise approach to building an understanding of racial inequities in socio-ecological systems (SES) research and practice including four entry points: (1) racialized spatial distribution of hazards and amenities, (2) racialized qualities of space, (3) racialized people in space, and (4) racialized creation of space. Finally, the third part proposes actions the SES community can take to enhance our commitment to community recovery, improvement, and thrivability. This perspective cautions practitioners and researchers against opportunistic or quick-fix solutions, and instead challenges our colleagues to be inclusive of disenfranchised voices in shaping socio-ecological goals, now more than ever. The goal of this perspective is to spark engagement with power and privilege in parks and open space using the example of COVID-19 and race in the US.","Hoover, Fushcia -Ann; Lim, Theodore C.",Socio Ecol Pract Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7684571/,12

44339,Unveiling pharmacological studies provide new insights on Mangifera longipes and Quercus gomeziana,2020-09-24,"BACKGROUND: We propose a modified lung ultrasound (LUS) score in neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which includes posterior instead of lateral lung fields, and a 5-grade rating scale instead of a 4-grade rating scale. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of the rating scale and its correlation with blood oxygenation and to assess the ability of early post-birth scans to predict the mode of respiratory support on day of life 3 (DOL 3). As a secondary objective, the weight of posterior scans in the overall LUS score was assessed. METHODS: We analyzed 619 serial lung scans performed in 70 preterm infants < 32 weeks gestation and birth weight < 1500 g. Assessments were performed within 24 h of birth (LUS(0)) and on days 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28. LUS scores were correlated with oxygen saturation over fraction of inspired oxygen (S/F) and mode of respiratory support. Interrater agreement was determined with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach’s alpha. Probabilities of the need for various respiratory support modes on DOL 3 were assessed with ordinal logistic regression. Least square (ls) means of the posterior and anterior pulmonary field scores were compared. RESULTS: The LUS score correlated significantly with S/F (Spearman rho = −0.635; p < 0.0001) and had excellent interrater agreement (ICC = 0.94, 95% CI 0.93–0.95; Cronbach’s alpha = 0.99). Significant predictors of ventilation requirements on DOL 3 were LUS(0) (p < 0.016) and birth weight (BW) (p < 0.001). In the ROC analysis, LUS(0) had high reliability in prognosing invasive ventilation on DOL 3 (AUC = 0.845 (95% DeLong CI: 0.738–0.951; p < 0.001)). Invasive ventilation was the most likely mode of respiratory support for LUS(0) scores: ≥7 (in infants with BW 900 g), ≥ 10 (in infants with BW 1050 g) and ≥ 15 (in infants with BW 1280 g). Posterior fields exhibited significantly higher average scores than anterior fields. Respective ls means (confidence levels) were 4.0 (3.8–4.1) vs. 2.2 (2.0–2.4); p < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Post-birth LUS predicts ventilation requirements on DOL 3. Scores of posterior pulmonary fields have a predominant weight in the overall LUS score.","Szymański, Piotr; Kruczek, Piotr; Hożejowski, Roman; Wais, Piotr",BMC Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7785923/,12

METHODS: The precautions, test procedures, and risk factors associated with the practice of audiology were evaluated. The number and diagnoses of the cases between 23 March and 23 May 2020 were also compared with the results of the same 2 months in 2019 in an attempt to evaluate the alterations in the audiology practice. RESULTS: The audiology practice has continued during the pandemic, and numerous audiovestibular tests like newborn hearing screening, pure tone and speech audiometry, auditory brainstem response (ABR) test, bedside vestibular assessment, videomystagmography (VNG), caloric test, vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP), computerized dynamic posturography (CDP), video head impulse test (vHIT), intraoperative cochlear implant measurement, and postop cochlear implant fittings were performed. The number of tests has decreased significantly in the course of the pandemic (p < 0.01). No evidence of Covid-19 disease was detected in the audiology staff and patients. In general, no major risk was seen during testing under protective measures except for vestibular testing which induced vomiting and taking out the mask for lip reading during cochlear implant fitting in the elderly. CONCLUSION: It is possible to perform audiovestibular tests during the Covid-19 pandemic by wearing necessary protective equipment and disinfecting the potential surfaces. Vomiting during vestibular tests, uncovering the nose and mouth for lip reading, and small-sized test cabins are the main risk factors of contamination in the audiology clinics.","Yilmaz, Oğuz; Bayazit, Dilara; Yaman, Handan; Mutlu, Berna Özge",Egypt J Otolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7829635/,12

The platform phenomena also enables co-creation of content, shifting the way services are delivered across diverse boundaries. This is especially apparent in workplaces, where the developments change roles, relationships and conditions for teaching and learning, creating the possibility of a two-sided market. From a socio-technical and socio-cultural learning perspective, this study primarily aims for a better understanding of platforms in higher educational settings. Using a learning platform as an illustrative case, we argue for platform context transactions that are not monetary transactions. The main contribution of the paper is to offer a discussion where we problematize the transactional concept in two-sided markets. The findings shed new light on emerging challenges and tensions in the interplay between the constant change of technology and what it means to work in such change. This has implications for both teaching and learning and offers insights that can be valuable for understanding the shift to online learning during the recent pandemic of covid-19.","Islind, Anna Sigridur; Norström, Livia; Vallo Hult, Helena; Olsson, Suzana Ramadani",Digital Transformation and Human Behavior,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991607/,12

52751,Contents list including Graphcal Abstracts,2021-05-10,"Acromegaly is rarely due to an excess of the GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and pituitary hyperplasia on histology should alert to its presence. Clinical Case: A 35-year-old was referred to surgery with a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic acromegaly. Her GH failed to suppress during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), her IGF-1 and prolactin was high. Her serum calcium was normal and her chromogranin B was high. MRI scan suggested microadenoma. Her surgery was deferred because of Covid 19, and she was treated with somatostatin analog (SSA). She finally had surgery in July. The histology and immunocytochemistry suggested pituitary hyperplasia with diffuse positivity for chromogranin and synaptophysin. GH was positive in the majority of the cells with many cells positive for Prolactin and ACTH. FSH and LH were positive in scattered cells with patchy positivity of TSH. A solitary nodule was noted in her neck during an examination. We arranged to look for conditions associated with pituitary hyperplasia resulting in GHRH production, including the genetic tests for inherited conditions. Her calcitonin level was normal. She had an ultrasound scan guided fine needle aspiration of the thyroid nodule, this showed Thy3f oncocytic nodule with no features of medullary thyroid carcinoma. She had an NMGa68DOTATATE whole body PET CTand the scan showed a large DOTATAE avid mass from the right adrenal gland compatible with Pheochromocytoma. Her 24 hours total urinary metadrenaline and normetadrenalin was high. Her genetic test for MEN1, CDKN1B, and MEN2 are negative. We have requested the GHRH measurement. After a pituitary surgery, her GH suppressed adequately on OGTT. Her IGF-1 and prolactin is low and her hypogonadism is resolved. Conclusion: Excess production GHRH can result from neuroendocrine tumors of the lung, pancreas, thyroid (medullary thyroid cancer), or pheochromocytomas and hypothalamic gangliocytomas. Several familial syndromes, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and 4 (MEN4), familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA), Carney complex, and sporadic germline mosaic disorder McCune-Albright disease predispose to pituitary hyperplasia. GHRH acromegaly should be suspected in a patient with biochemical/clinical features of acromegaly in the presence of co-existing neuroendocrine tumors when there is diffuse pituitary enlargement on imaging or resolution of acromegaly after the surgical resection of the primary neuroendocrine tumour or persistent acromegaly after surgery if there is histological evidence of somatotroph hyperplasia.

We exploit the differential vaccination practices of East Germany and West Germany prior to reunification to test this hypothesis. Using a difference in regression discontinuities (RD-DD) design centred on the end of universal vaccination in the West, we find that differences in COVID-19 severity across cohorts in the East and West are insignificant or have the wrong sign. We document a sharp cross-sectional discontinuity in the severity of the disease, which we attribute to limited mobility across the long-gone border and which disappears when we control for social connectedness. Case and death data after the end of the first lockdown on 26 April does not display a discontinuity at the former border, suggesting that mobility (as opposed to BCG vaccination) played a major role during the initial outbreak.","Bluhm, Richard; Pinkovskiy, Maxim",Econom J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136030/,12
53515,Insights into Nuclear G-Protein-Coupled Receptors as Therapeutic Targets in Non-Communicable Diseases,2021-05-07,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR) was one of the many areas negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. A high number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients had their centre-based program suspended. Physical activity (PA) recommendations for CVD patients are well established and its benefits largely documented. However, few studies have objectively measured the PA of these patients throughout the years and specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE: To objectively measure PA and sedentary time (ST) during COVID-19 pandemic in comparison with the previous 2 years in CVD patients who were attending a phase III centre-based CR program. METHODS: Before COVID-19, eighty-seven CVD patients (mean age 62.9 ± 9.1, 82.8% male) were attending a face-to-face long-term CR program. Of the 87 patients, 78.2% have been on the program for at least 1 year. Every year, PA and ST were objectively assessed by accelerometery. After the CR centre-based program suspension due to COVID-19, efforts were done to create a CR home-based digital model to maintain the continuum of care and avoid losing the previous acquired benefits. After 7 months of suspension, the face-to-face CR centre was reopened and 57.5% (n = 50) patients returned. We completed the assessment of PA and ST of 37 patients (mean age 64.8 ± 8.1, 89.2% male) and compared it as follows: M1) two assessments before COVID-19; M2) last assessment before COVID-19; M3) 7 months after CR program suspension (last trimester of 2020). Patients wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for 7 consecutive days to assess daily and weekly minutes of light PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA and ST. We used repeated-measures ANOVA and Wilcoxon signed rank as a non-parametric alternative. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis showed that in M3 patients decreased their average daily time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA when compared with M2 (M3: 37.90 ± 3.30 min/day vs M2: 45.01 ± 3.14 min/day, p = 0.035), no changes were found between M1 and M2. Average daily time spent in light PA improved significantly from M1 to M2 (M1: 154.81 ± 7.20 min/day vs M2: 169.17 ± 6.44 min/day, p = 0.042) but did not change from M2 to M3. Despite this, in M3, 81.08% of the patients still met the recommendations for moderate-to-vigorous PA (M1: 89.19% and M2: 91.89%). No changes were found in ST. CONCLUSION: Despite a significant decrease on the amount of moderate-to-vigorous PA during the COVID-19 era, most CVD patients, first in the centre-based CR program and after in the home-based CR program, were able to meet PA recommendations throughout the last years. These findings suggest that CVD patients who attend supervised long-term CR programs might be aware of the importance of reaching PA guidelines. Reducing ST by replacing it by PA of any intensity could be an important and reachable target for long-term CR programs.","Lemos Pires, M; Borges, M; Pinto, R; Ricardo, I; Cunha, N; Alves Da Silva, P; Linan Pinto, M; Sousa Guerreiro, C; Pinto, FJ; Santa-Clara, H; Abreu, A",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136049/,12

Hence, new studies play an essential role to improve Fintech investments. This study evaluates Fintech-based investments of European banking services with an application of an original methodology that considers interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory and IT2 fuzzy TOPSIS models. Empirical findings are controlled for consistency by applying the VIKOR method. Moreover, we conduct a sensitivity analysis by considering six distinct cases. This study contributes to the existing literature by identifying the most important Fintech-based investment alternatives to improve the financial performance of European banks. Our empirical findings illustrate that results are coherent, reliable, and identify “competitive advantage” as the most important factor among Fintech-based determinants. Moreover, “payment and money transferring systems” are the most important Fintech-based investment alternatives. It is recommended that, among Fintech-based investments, European banks should mainly focus on payment and money transferring alternatives to attract the attention of customers and satisfy their expectations. This is also believed to have a positive impact on the ease of bank’ receivable collection. Another important point is that Fintech-based investments in money transferring systems could help to decrease costs.","Kou, Gang; Olgu Akdeniz, Özlem; Dinçer, Hasan; Yüksel, Serhat",Financ Innov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8138114/,12

The main compound, limonene, was also tested in biological assays. Eighty-four compounds, accounting for a relative peak area of 99.23%, 98.58% and 99.64%, were identified by GC/MS. Limonene (59–60%), γ-terpinene (10–11%) and β-pinene (7–15%) were the main compounds. All lemon oils inhibited specific biofilm production and bacterial metabolic activities into biofilm in a dose-dependent manner (20–65%, in the range of 0.1–4 mg mL(−1)) of both strains. Besides, all samples inhibited about 50% of the elastase activity at 0.1 mg mL(−1). Pyocyanin biosynthesis decreases until 64% (0.1–4 mg mL(−1)) for both strains. Swarming motility of P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 was completely inhibited by 2 mg mL(−1) of lemon oils. Furthermore, a decrease (29–55%, 0.1–4 mg mL(−1)) in the synthesis of Quorum sensing (QS) signals was observed. The oils showed higher biological activities than limonene. Hence, their ability to control the biofilm of P. aeruginosa and reduce the production of virulence factors regulated by QS makes lemon oils good candidates to be applied as preservatives in the food processing industry.","Luciardi, María Constanza; Blázquez, María Amparo; Alberto, María Rosa; Cartagena, Elena; Arena, Mario Eduardo",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8151035/,12

Those challenges in their dynamic complexity require new cross-scale, cross-domain and action-oriented approaches at the universities. I argue that universities need to go beyond their traditional missions and to take an active role in a transformative change by working with their communities and creating real social impact. The fourth mission concept is particularly relevant as it puts emphasis on the universities roles in sustainable development. I propose to reflect on those new roles of universities in the context of quadruple/quintuple helix model that is seen as playing an important role in fostering the shift from technical to social innovations. Social innovation is an element of a regional innovation system, in which the importance of knowledge is not determined exclusively by competitiveness and productivity, but by taking into account the creation of social well-being, the impact on the quality of life and co-creation of knowledge as part of public–private partnerships. By addressing social innovation practices from a perspective of Polish public universities, it fills the gap of relatively few studies on institutional change and incentive structures that influences the ability of universities to engage in social innovation by proposing. I propose to adapt the socially engaged university model that could be a tool for stimulating and strengthening their functions within a modern regional innovation system allowing for an active role of civil society organisations.","Morawska-Jancelewicz, Joanna",J Knowl Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8214917/,12

However, our understanding of how WTO affects firm behavior is limited. Taking advantage of the variations in entry dates to the World Trade Organization, we perform difference-in-differences estimation to examine whether a country’s accession to the WTO significantly increases firms’ export intensity. In addition, we apply insights from the threat-rigidity hypothesis to argue that firms’ reactions to supranational institutions vary depending on how managers perceive the institutional environment. We find that firms from countries that enter the WTO experience significantly higher growth in export intensity when their managers have positive perceptions about domestic institutions. In contrast, accession to the WTO does not significantly increase firms’ export intensity whose managers perceive domestic institutions as obstacles. Our findings suggest that supranational institutions, such as the WTO, play an important role in the strategic decisions that firms make. However, the full value of such institutions can only be realized if the managers are aware and positively disposed to engage with these institutions.","Nuruzzaman, N.; Gaur, Ajai; Sambharya, Rakesh B.",J Int Bus Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8220881/,12

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection is known to cause vascular endothelial dysfunction. However, the long‐term effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 in resistance vessels remains unknown. This study is designed to test whether endothelium‐dependent vasodilation in human arterioles remains impaired after clearance of SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. Fresh human adipose tissues were obtained as discarded surgical specimens from control subjects (n=15, no SARS‐CoV‐2 exposure, 46.7±4 years) and previously SARS‐CoV‐2 positive subjects (PSPSs: n=8, 35.8±3.8 years). Among PSPSs, the time between positive and negative SARS‐CoV‐2 test results was ≤3 months (n=6) or 8 months (n=2). Isolated arterioles (100‐200 µm) were cannulated under 60 mmHg and examined for diameter changes to acetylcholine (ACh; 10(−9) to 10(−5) M) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP: 10(−9) to 10(−4) M) using videomicroscopy. Flow‐mediated dilation (FMD) was recorded at steady‐state during graded increases in intraluminal pressure gradients (5‐100 cm H(2)O). Dilation to ACh and FMD in arterioles from PSPSs was significantly reduced (ACh max. dilation at 10(−5) M: 60±6% vs. 92.8±3.9% in control, n=7‐8, P<0.001; FMD max. dilation at 100 cm H(2)O: 39.9±5.7% vs. 85.8±1.8% in control, n=6‐8, P<0.001, Fig.1) while endothelial‐independent dilation in response to SNP was not different between groups (max. dilation at 10(‐4) M: 86.6±2.7% vs. 92.3±2.1% in control, n=5). To compare time‐dependent effects of previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, we compared max. dilator capacity vs. time after exposure (Fig. 2). At ≤3 months post exposure, FMD was significantly impaired (% max. dilation: 26.7±7.4, n=5) whereas at 8 months endothelial function began to normalize (% max. dilation: 41.8±17.6, n=2). In conclusion, we observed significantly reduced endothelial‐dependent dilation months after exposed to SARS‐CoV‐2. Our data suggests SARS‐CoV‐2 may cause long‐term endothelial dysfunction in human arterioles.","Nishijima, Yoshinori; Hader, Shelby; Zhang, David; Gutterman, David; Beyer, Andreas",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239810/,12

This dynamic plays out across the 35 countries in our sample, with notable departures in China, South Korea and Taiwan.

In the case of two waves only, the model parameters vary as a function of time according to a logistic function, whose two extreme values, i.e., for early and late times, characterize the first and second waves, respectively. For the multiple-wave model, the time-dependency of the parameters is likewise described by a multi-step logistic function with N intermediate plateaus, representing the N waves of the epidemic. We show that the theoretical curves are in excellent agreement with the empirical data for all countries considered here, namely: Brazil, Canada, Germany, Iran, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Sweden, and the USA. The model also allows for predictions about the time of occurrence and severity of the subsequent waves.

59530,A neck compression injury criterion incorporating lateral eccentricity.,2020-04-28,"UNLABELLED Under physiological conditions, the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) mediate hepatic immune tolerance toward self or foreign antigens through constitutive expression of anti-inflammatory mediators. However, upon viral infection or Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) activation, LSECs can achieve proinflammatory functions, but their role in hepatic inflammation during acute viral hepatitis is unknown. Using the highly virulent mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) and the attenuated variants 51.6-MHV3 and YAC-MHV3, exhibiting lower tropism for LSECs, we investigated in vivo and in vitro the consequence of LSEC infection on their proinflammatory profiles and the aggravation of acute hepatitis process. In vivo infection with virulent MHV3, in comparison to attenuated strains, resulted in fulminant hepatitis associated with higher hepatic viral load, tissue necrosis, and levels of inflammatory mediators and earlier recruitment of inflammatory cells. Such hepatic inflammatory disorders correlated with disturbed production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and vascular factors by LSECs. We next showed in vitro that infection of LSECs by the virulent MHV3 strain altered their production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and promoted higher release of proinflammatory and procoagulant factors and earlier cell damage than infection by attenuated strains. This higher replication and proinflammatory activation in LSECs by the virulent MHV3 strain was associated with a specific activation of TLR2 signaling by the virus. We provide evidence that TLR2 activation of LSCEs by MHV3 is an aggravating factor of hepatic inflammation and correlates with the severity of hepatitis. Taken together, these results indicate that preservation of the immunotolerant properties of LSECs during acute viral hepatitis is imperative in order to limit hepatic inflammation and damage. IMPORTANCE Viral hepatitis B and C infections are serious health problems affecting over 350 million and 170 million people worldwide, respectively. It has been suggested that a balance between protection and liver damage mediated by the host's immune response during the acute phase of infection would be determinant in hepatitis outcome. Thus, it appears crucial to identify the factors that predispose in exacerbating liver inflammation to limit hepatocyte injury. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) can express both anti- and proinflammatory functions, but their role in acute viral hepatitis has never been investigated. Using mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infections as animal models of viral hepatitis, we report for the first time that in vitro and in vivo infection of LSECs by the pathogenic MHV3 serotype leads to a reversion of their intrinsic anti-inflammatory phenotype toward a proinflammatory profile as well to as disorders in vascular factors, correlating with the severity of hepatitis. These results highlight a new virus-promoted mechanism of exacerbation of liver inflammatory response during acute hepatitis.","Bleau, Christian; Filliol, Aveline; Samson, Michel; Lamontagne, Lucie",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01069-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27489277/,12

The latest political crises and war have led to an upsurge in refugee movements into European countries, giving rise to a re-evaluation of the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders and mental health problems among young refugees and asylum seekers. We systematically searched five electronic databases and reference lists of pertinent review articles. We then screened the results of forward citation tracking of key articles for relevant studies in the field for the period from January 1990 to October 2017. We dually reviewed citations and assessed risk of bias. We reported the results narratively, as meta-analyses were impeded due to high heterogeneity. We included 47 studies covered in 53 articles. Overall, the point prevalence of the investigated psychiatric disorders and mental health problems varied widely among studies (presenting interquartile ranges): for posttraumatic stress disorder between 19.0 and 52.7%, for depression between 10.3 and 32.8%, for anxiety disorders between 8.7 and 31.6%, and for emotional and behavioural problems between 19.8 and 35.0%.

STUDY DESIGN We conducted a prospective single pediatric tertiary care center cohort study of inpatients aged 0-18 months with a first episode of acute bronchiolitis from November 1st 2014 to April 30th 2017. Disease severity was determined by the length of hospitalization and supplemental hospital data. Qualitative measurements included serum 25(OH)D and nasal secretion LL-37 and β-defensin-2 levels. Correlations were examined with the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis criteria for qualitative and the correlation coefficient Spearman's rho for quantitative factors. Multiple linear and logarithmic regression were performed in order to adjust for confounding factors. RESULTS The study population consisted of 153 infants and toddlers with median age 3.1 months (IQR:1.6-4.9). No association was found between serum 25(OH)D and AMPs nasal secretions levels. Serum 25(OH)D and nasal secretion β-defensin-2 levels were not associated with the severity of bronchiolitis. In contrast, LL-37 levels were inversely associated with the length of hospitalization (rho=-0.340, p=0.001), the need for medication use (p=0.001), as well as the duration of oxygen supplementation (rho =-0.339, p=0.001) and intravenous fluid administration (rho=-0.323, p=0.001). This association remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSION A significant association between LL-37 nasal secretions levels with the severity of acute bronchiolitis was found in hospitalized infants and toddlers. The role of LL-37 in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis merits further investigation. This article is protected by copyright.

The control of helminths relies heavily on routine use of chemotherapeutics, but this approach is unsustainable as resistance to anthelmintic drugs is widespread and increasing. At the same time, infection patterns are being altered by changes in climate, land-use and farming practices. Future farms will need to adopt more efficient, robust and sustainable control methods, integrating ongoing scientific advances. Here, we present a vision of helminth control in farmed ruminants by 2030, bringing to bear progress in: (1) diagnostic tools, (2) innovative control approaches based on vaccines and selective breeding, (3) anthelmintics, by sustainable use of existing products and potentially new compounds, and (4) rational integration of future control practices. In this review, we identify the technical advances that we believe will place new tools in the hands of animal health decision makers in 2030, to enhance their options for control and allow them to achieve a more integrated and sustainable approach to helminth control in support of animal welfare and production.","Vercruysse, Jozef; Charlier, Johannes; Van Dijk, Jan; Morgan, Eric R; Geary, Tim; von Samson-Himmelstjerna, Georg; Claerebout, Edwin",Parasitology,https://doi.org/10.1017/s003118201700227x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29415781/,12

The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes with non-TF TAVR access techniques including transapical (TA), transaortic (TAo), and transcarotid (TC) TAVR with a balloon-expandable valve. METHODS A retrospective review was performed of all patients undergoing TA, TAo, and TC TAVR from 2007 to 2013 at Emory University. Preoperative risk factors and postoperative outcomes were evaluated using Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 definitions. RESULTS Of 469 patients undergoing TAVR during that period at our institution, 139 underwent TA TAVR, 35 had Tao TAVR, and 11 had TC TAVR. Patients undergoing TC TAVR were younger than those undergoing TA TAVR and TAo TAVR (mean ages: TC, 68.9 ± 23.6 years; TA, 81.3 ± 7.7 years; Tao, 83.8 ± 8.3 years; p = 0.017). Most patients undergoing TAo TAVR were women (82.9%), whereas patients undergoing TA TAVR were more likely to be men (62.6%). Slightly more than half of patients undergoing TA TAVR (54.7%) and TC (54.6%) TAVR had undergone previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), whereas no patients underwent TAo TAVR (0%). There was no preoperative difference in ejection fraction, New York Heart Association classification, significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality between TA TAVR, Tao TAVR, and TC TAVR, respectively. Average postoperative length of stay was 9 to 11 days and was similar among groups (p = 0.22). There were 13 (9.4%) TA TAVR operative deaths and 4 (11.4%) operative deaths in the TAo TAVR group. There were no deaths in the TC TAVR group. CONCLUSIONS In high-risk and inoperable patients who are not candidates for TF TAVR, careful selection of alternative access options can lead to excellent and comparable postoperative outcomes.","Thourani, Vinod H; Li, Chun; Devireddy, Chandan; Jensen, Hanna A; Kilgo, Patrick; Leshnower, Bradley G; Mavromatis, Kreton; Sarin, Eric L; Nguyen, Tom C; Kanitkar, Mihir; Guyton, Robert A; Block, Peter C; Maas, Amanda L; Simone, Amy; Keegan, Patricia; Merlino, John; Stewart, James P; Lerakis, Stamatios; Babaliaros, Vasilis",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2014.10.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25596868/,12

However, whether adding a proximal jejunal bypass (PJB) to this procedure might increase the efficacy is unknown. METHODS Outcomes of 74 (43 women and 31male) obese patients who had undergone PJB-GC (41) or GC (33) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) with 1 year follow-up were assessed. GC consists of creating a transverse gastric partition with a metallic clip. PJB consists of a jejuno-ileostomy between 20 and 320 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. Postoperative body mass index (BMI) reduction, total weight loss (TWL), and remission rates of T2D were evaluated. RESULTS The preoperative clinical characters in both groups were similar. The mean operative time was significantly longer in the PJB-GC group than in the GC group. At 24 months after surgery, the BMI was lower (32.5 ± 6.2 vs. 37.0 ± 5.9 kg/m2, p = 0.002) and weight loss higher in PJB-GC than GC (TWL 31.3 ± 14.8 vs. 23.5 ± 10.4%, p = 0.011). Remission of T2D was greater in the PJB-GC group (90.2 vs. 57.2%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In this study, PJB-GC was superior to GC in weight loss and T2D remission at 1 and 2 years after surgery. Adding PJB to GC increased the effect of weight loss and diabetic control.","Chao, Seh-Huang; Lin, Chia-Lin; Lee, Wei-Jei; Chen, Jung-Chien; Chou, Ju Jun",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-018-3607-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30697678/,12

The American Heart Association (AHA) Life's Simple 7 (LS7) framework outlines goals for attaining ideal cardiovascular health. Yet, there is a lack of evidence summarizing best practices to maximize LS7 attainment. The objective of the present study was to systematically review the extant peer-reviewed literature on community-engaged and community-based participatory research (CBPR) aimed at improving one or more LS7 metrics among AA. METHODS PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases were searched. We included articles that reported quantitative results for one or more of the following LS7 metrics: physical activity, diet, cholesterol, blood pressure, body mass index, smoking, and glycemia. We included analyses with a greater than 50% AA study population focused on adults (≥18 years of age). RESULTS Of the 1008 unique studies identified, 54 met inclusion criteria; 27 of which were randomized controlled trials. 50% of studies assessed more than one LS7 metric but only two studies evaluated all seven of the LS7 metrics. No studies had a high proportion of AA males. 40 studies improved at least one LS7 metric at the study end-point. Formative research was used in many studies to guide intervention design. Studies were of varying quality, but overall rated ""fair"" using a modified approach to the National Institute of Health quality assessment tool. CONCLUSION There is insufficient data to recommend a specific community-engaged or CBPR intervention to improve attainment of LS7 metrics among AA. Future studies using rigorous methodology with increased gender diversity and utilizing the AHA LS7 framework are required to establish a validated program to improve LS7 in AAs.","Elgazzar, Rana; Nolan, Timiya S; Joseph, Joshua J; Aboagye-Mensah, Emmanuela B; Azap, Rosevine A; Gray, Darrell M",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32870944/,12

We demonstrate the application of one such simple automated machine learning algorithm to a dataset obtained about COVID-19 spread in South Korea to better understand the disease dynamics. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data from 20th January 2020 (when the first case of COVID-19 was detected in South Korea) to 4th March 2020 was accessed from Korea's centre for disease control (KCDC). A future time-series of specified length (taken as 7 days in our study) starting from 5th March 2020 to 11th March 2020 was generated and fed to the model to generate predictions with upper and lower trend bounds of 95% confidence intervals. The model was assessed for its ability to reliably forecast using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as the metric. RESULTS As on 4th March 2020, 145,541 patients were tested for COVID-19 (in 45 days) in South Korea of which 5166 patients tested positive. The predicted values approximated well with the actual numbers. The difference between predicted and observed values ranged from 4.08% to 12.77% . On average, our predictions differed from actual values by 7.42% (MAPE) over the same period.

63687,Giant Second-Harmonic Generation Response and Large Band Gap in the Partially Fluorinated Mid-Infrared Oxide RbTeMo2O8F.,2021-08-09,"In bovine mammary glands, the ABCG2 transporter actively secretes xenobiotics into dairy milk. This can have significant implications when cattle are exposed to pesticide residues in feed. Recent studies indicate that the fungicide prochloraz activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway, increasing bovine ABCG2 (bABCG2) gene expression and efflux activity. This could enhance the accumulation of bABCG2 substrates in dairy milk, impacting pesticide risk assessment. We therefore investigated whether 13 commonly used pesticides in Europe are inducers of AhR and bABCG2 activity. MDCKII cells expressing mammary bABCG2 were incubated with pesticides for up to 72 h. To reflect an in vivo situation, applied pesticide concentrations corresponded to the maximum residue levels (MRLs) permitted in bovine fat or muscle. AhR activation was ascertained through CYP1A mRNA expression and enzyme activity, measured by qPCR and 7-ethoxyresorufin-Ο-deethylase (EROD) assay, respectively. Pesticide-mediated increase of bABCG2 efflux activity was assessed using the Hoechst 33342 accumulation assay. For all assays, the known AhR-activating pesticide prochloraz served as a positive control, while the non-activating tolclofos-methyl provided the negative control. At 10-fold MRL concentrations, chlorpyrifos-methyl, diflufenican, ioxynil, rimsulfuron, and tebuconazole significantly increased CYP1A1 mRNA levels, CYP1A activity, and bABCG2 efflux activity compared to the vehicle control. In contrast, dimethoate, dimethomorph, glyphosate, iprodione, methiocarb and thiacloprid had no impact on AhR-mediated CYP1A1 mRNA levels, CYP1A activity or bABCG2 efflux. In conclusion, the MDCKII-bABCG2 cell model proved an appropriate tool for identifying AhR- and bABCG2-inducing pesticides. This provides an in vitro approach that could reduce the number of animals required in pesticide approval studies.","Kuhnert, Lydia; Giantin, Mery; Dacasto, Mauro; Halwachs, Sandra; Honscha, Walther",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764792/,12

In this commentary, we discuss the opportunities and challenges that may affect ongoing public health programming in Australia within the current context of epidemiology. COVID-19 within Australia has to date been effectively suppressed through the implementation of nationally coordinated, in which the state delivered public policy, guidelines and practice, and successful establishment of a comprehensive testing, contact tracing, patient isolation and contact quarantine regime combined with national and state social distancing, hygiene etiquette and movement restrictions. However, despite its success to date great challenges lay ahead for future public health policy with the threat of a second wave, or more likely, multiple smaller outbreaks across various population centres. Therefore, policies that aim to balance the twin socioeconomic and health impacts are crucial.

Small studies suggest that CCM could be used to assess patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). AIM To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the diagnostic utility of CCM for sub-clinical DPN (DPN- ) and established DPN (DPN+ ). DATA SOURCES Databases (PubMed, Embase, Central, ProQuest) were searched for studies using CCM in patients with diabetes up to April 2020. STUDY SELECTION Studies were included if they reported on at least one CCM parameter in patients with diabetes. DATA EXTRACTION Corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), corneal nerve branch density (CNBD), corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL) and inferior whorl length (IWL) were compared between patients with diabetes with and without DPN and controls. Meta-analysis was undertaken using RevMan V.5.3. DATA SYNTHESIS Thirty-eight studies including ~4000 participants were included in this meta-analysis. There were significant reductions in CNFD, CNBD, CNFL and IWL in DPN- vs. controls (P<0.00001), DPN+ vs. controls (P<0.00001) and DPN+ vs. DPN- (P<0.00001).

To describe a health equity curriculum created for pharmacy students and evaluate students' perceptions and structural competency after completion of the curriculum.Methods. A health equity curriculum (HEC) based on transformative learning and structural competency frameworks was implemented as a 10-week mandatory component of the pass-no pass neuropsychiatric theme for second-year pharmacy students. Each week, students reviewed materials around a neuropsychiatric-related health equity topic and responded to discussion prompts through asynchronous forums or synchronous Zoom discussions. The HEC was evaluated through assessment of structural competency through a validated instrument (SCI), an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), and a questionnaire.Results. All enrolled second-year pharmacy students (n=124) participated in the HEC. Of the 75 (68%) students who completed the SCI, 46 (61%) were able to identify structural determinants of health, explain how structures contribute to health disparities, or design structural interventions. Ninety-six (77%) students were able to address their OSCE standardized patient's mistrust in the healthcare system. Thematic analysis of student comments elucidated three themes-allyship, peer connection, and self-awareness. Students rated asynchronous discussion forums as significantly less effective than Zoom discussions and patient cases for achieving curricular objectives.Conclusion. A remote, mandatory, blended health equity curriculum demonstrated an effective model for social justice-oriented education. From our experience, a curriculum spread throughout the didactic curriculum with a blended approach is an effective way to incorporate health equity conversations into existing programs and could be an important step in training student pharmacists to be advocates for social justice.","Hsia, Stephanie L; Landsfeld, Aubrey; Lam, Kelly; Tuan, Rupa Lalchandani",American journal of pharmaceutical education,https://doi.org/10.5688/ajpe8579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34301552/,12

Macrolides are recommended for the treatment of M. pneumoniae respiratory tract infection, but macrolide resistance has been reported at low levels in Europe. The aim of the study was to examine the clinical impact of the recent M. pneumoniae epidemic in a hospital setting in Scotland and to determine whether macrolide-resistant strains are present. Data were analysed retrospectively for 307 patients with M. pneumoniae respiratory infection diagnosed in 2010 and 2011 in Edinburgh, UK. Genotypic macrolide resistance testing was also carried out in 32 patients in whom resistance was considered most likely, based on their clinical picture. We found that 175 patients (59 %) were admitted to hospital, 20 (7 %) were admitted to critical care and 97 (38 %) required oxygen. All 48 adult patients (100 %) were admitted to hospital, compared with 127 children (51 %). Adults were also more likely to require oxygen [odds ratio (OR) 4.964, P<0.001, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2.129-11.803] and to be admitted to critical care (OR 4.909, P = 0.001, 95 % CI 1.735-13.829), compared with children. Macrolide resistance conferred by the 23S rRNA gene mutation was found in samples from 6 out of 32 patients (19 %) in the subset tested. The results suggest that the recent M. pneumoniae epidemic was associated with a significant burden of hospital admission locally. The study also describes the first case series of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae in the UK, indicating that macrolide resistance surveillance is warranted in preparation for the next epidemic.","Ferguson, Graeme D; Gadsby, Naomi J; Henderson, Sarah S; Hardie, Alison; Kalima, Pota; Morris, Andrew Conway; Hill, Adam T; Cunningham, Steve; Templeton, Kate E",Journal of medical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.066191-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24008501/,12

65986,"Breath analysis for detection of viral infection, the current position of the field.",2020-06-12,"In utero, fetal lung epithelial cells actively secrete Cl(-) ions into the lung air spaces while Na(+) ions follow passively to maintain electroneutrality. This process, driven by an electrochemical gradient generated by the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, is responsible for the secretion of fetal fluid that is essential for normal lung development. Shortly before birth, a significant upregulation of amiloride-sensitive epithelial channels (ENaCs) on the apical side of the lung epithelial cells results in upregulation of active Na(+) transport. This process is critical for the reabsorption of fetal lung fluid and the establishment of optimum gas exchange. In the adult lung, active Na(+) reabsorption across distal lung epithelial cells limits the degree of alveolar edema in patients with acute lung injury and cardiogenic edema. Cl(-) ions are transported either paracellularly or transcellularly to preserve electroneutrality. An increase in Cl(-) secretion across the distal lung epithelium has been reported following an acute increase in left atrial pressure and may result in pulmonary edema. In contrast, airway epithelial cells secrete Cl(-) through apical cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels and absorb Na(+). Thus the coordinated action of Cl(-) secretion and Na(+) absorption is essential for maintenance of the volume of epithelial lining fluid that, in turn, maximizes mucociliary clearance and facilitates clearance of bacteria and debris from the lungs. Any factor that interferes with Na(+) or Cl(-) transport or dramatically upregulates ENaC activity in airway epithelial cells has been associated with lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive lung disease. In this review we focus on the role of the ENaC, the mechanisms involved in ENaC regulation, and how ENaC dysregulation can lead to lung pathology.","Matalon, Sadis; Bartoszewski, Rafal; Collawn, James F",American journal of physiology.

66231,Is the third interferon a charm?,2015,"Rapid diagnostics of adventitious agents in biopharmaceutical/cell manufacturing release testing and the fight against viral infection have become critical. Quantitative real-time PCR and CRISPR-based methods rapidly detect DNA/RNA in 1 h but suffer from inter-site variability. Absolute quantification of DNA/RNA by methods such as digital PCR reduce this variability but are currently too slow for wider application. Here, we report a RApid DIgital Crispr Approach (RADICA) for absolute quantification of nucleic acids in 40-60 min. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a proof-of-concept target, RADICA allows for absolute quantification with a linear dynamic range of 0.6-2027 copies/μL (R2 value > 0.99), high accuracy and low variability, no cross-reactivity to similar targets, and high tolerance to human background DNA. RADICA's versatility is validated against other targets such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from human B cells and patients' serum. RADICA can accurately detect and absolutely quantify EBV DNA with similar dynamic range of 0.5-2100 copies/μL (R2 value > 0.98) in 1 h without thermal cycling, providing a 4-fold faster alternative to digital PCR-based detection. RADICA therefore enables rapid and sensitive absolute quantification of nucleic acids which can be widely applied across clinical, research, and biomanufacturing areas.","Wu, Xiaolin; Tay, Joshua K; Goh, Chuan Keng; Chan, Cheryl; Lee, Yie Hou; Springs, Stacy L; Wang, De Yun; Loh, Kwok Seng; Lu, Timothy K; Yu, Hanry",Biomaterials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.120876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34034027/,12

OBJECTIVES To construct a comprehensive model to predict perioperative RBC transfusion in patients undergoing isolated CABG using adjusted preoperative variables. METHODS Perioperative data of 1253 patients who underwent isolated CABG by the same surgical team were collected from April 2018 to March 2019. Logistic regression analyses were used to establish equations to construct two models for predicting intraoperative and postoperative RBC transfusions, respectively. All significant variables included in the two models were combined to form a comprehensive model to predict perioperative RBC transfusion. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the discriminatory power of the models. RESULTS The total RBC transfusion rate for CABG patients during hospitalization was 29.05%. The rate of intraoperative and postoperative RBC transfusions was 6.9% and 26.7%, respectively. Eight variables in a total of 30 risk factors constituted the intraoperative prediction model, 12 variables constituted the postoperative prediction model, and 13 variables for the combined model. The AUC of the three models were 0.87, 0.82, and 0.83, respectively, demonstrating moderate discriminatory power for RBC transfusion during the intraoperative, postoperative, and perioperative periods. CONCLUSION The comprehensive model combined with all variables of predicting intraoperative and postoperative RBC transfusion is feasible for predicting perioperative RBC transfusion.","Lu, Liangyuan; Che, Ji; Xie, Wuxiang; Cheng, Weiping; Yang, Zhanmin; Dong, Ran; Huang, Jiapeng; Lu, Jiakai",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11748-020-01386-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418192/,12

Over the past 2.8 million years, humans and tools have co-evolved. However, in the last century, technology is introduced at a rate that exceeds human evolution. The proliferation of computers and, more recently, robots, introduces new cognitive demands, as the human is required to be a monitor rather than a direct controller. The usage of robots and artificial intelligence is only expected to increase, and the present COVID-19 pandemic may prove to be catalytic in this regard. One way to improve overall system performance is to 'adapt the human to the machine' via task procedures, operator training, operator selection, a Procrustean mandate. Using classic research examples, we demonstrate that Procrustean methods can improve performance only to a limited extent. For a viable future, therefore, technology must adapt to the human, which underwrites the necessity of human factors science.Practioner summary: Various research articles have reported that the science of Human Factors is of vital importance in improving human-machine systems.

As we respond to the SARS-COV2 pandemic with quarantine and social distancing, social isolation and feelings of loneliness are increasing among people of all ages. This presents as an opportune time to recognize the public health impact of these important psychosocial determinants. Loneliness and social isolation are associated with higher incidence of CVD, higher healthcare utilization and worse outcomes even after controlling for conventional risk factors of CVD. In this review, we discuss loneliness and social isolation as determinants of cardiovascular outcomes, the pathophysiology of this association, and its implications in clinical practice. We discuss some of the shortcomings in assessment of loneliness and social isolation while identifying most commonly used rating scales for the same. Finally, we suggest modifications to interventions for loneliness and social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sharma, Tanya; Padala, Prasad R; Mehta, Jawahar L",Current cardiology reviews,https://doi.org/10.2174/1573403x17666210129101845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33511946/,12

However, their effects on oesophageal motility in particular are often not as widely known or may be underestimated. AIM To review the effect of existing medication use on high-resolution oesophageal manometry (HRM) in a 'real-world' setting. METHODS Adult patients with upper gut symptoms and normal endoscopy or imaging who had HRM over a 22-month period were analysed. Achalasia and major disorders of peristalsis were excluded. All medications taken within 24 hours of the procedure were prospectively recorded and compared with HRM results, controlling for age, gender and proton pump inhibitor use. RESULTS A total of 502 patients (323 female, mean age 51) were recruited. Of these, 41.2% had normal oesophageal HRM, while 41.4% had ineffective oesophageal motility (IOM) and 7.6% had oesophagogastric junction outflow obstruction (OGJOO). Serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) and opioids were associated with significantly higher resting lower oesophageal sphincter pressure. Benzodiazepines and opioids were associated with elevated integrated relaxation pressure. SNRI and inhaled beta-agonists were associated with increased distal contractile index, whereas calcium channel blockers were associated with a lower distal contractile index. Odds ratio of being on anticholinergics was higher in IOM patients vs normal (3.6, CI 1.2-10.8). Odds ratio for anticholinergics, inhaled beta-agonists, anticonvulsants, SNRIs and opioids (trend) were all > 3 for OGJOO patients vs normal. CONCLUSION Many medication classes are associated with abnormal HRM variables and diagnoses such as OGJOO and IOM; some of these associations are probably causal. These possible links should be taken into consideration during manometry interpretation.","Moosavi, Sarvee; Woo, Matthew; Jacob, Deepti A; Pradhan, Sarah; Wilsack, Lynn; Buresi, Michelle; Gupta, Milli; Al-Awadh, Yacoub; Li, Dorothy; Andrews, Christopher N",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.15758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32383253/,12

Laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphies, such as the transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) and the totally extraperitoneal approaches, usually employ a method of fixation involving staples, titanium spiral tacks, or sutures to secure the mesh over the myopectineal orifice. The TAPP approach also requires closure of the peritoneal flap to exclude the mesh from the intraabdominal contents. Overall complication rates with TAPP are low, with small bowel obstruction incidence of 0.2% to 0.5%. This is usually attributed to inadequate peritoneal closure, trocar site herniation, or adhesions. We report a case of small bowel obstruction caused by a displaced spiral tack used for the peritoneal closure during TAPP hernia repair.","Fitzgerald, Heidi L; Orenstein, Sean B; Novitsky, Yuri W","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e3181dfbc05; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20551794/,12

Globally coordinated strategies to combat pandemics, similar to current strategies that address climate change, are largely adaptive, in that they attempt to reduce the impact of a pathogen after it has emerged. However, like climate change, mitigation strategies have been developed that include programs to reduce the underlying drivers of pandemics, particularly animal-to-human disease transmission. Here, we use real options economic modeling of current globally coordinated adaptation strategies for pandemic prevention. We show that they would be optimally implemented within 27 y to reduce the annual rise of emerging infectious disease events by 50% at an estimated one-time cost of approximately $343.7 billion. We then analyze World Bank data on multilateral ""One Health"" pandemic mitigation programs. We find that, because most pandemics have animal origins, mitigation is a more cost-effective policy than business-as-usual adaptation programs, saving between $344.0.7 billion and $360.3 billion over the next 100 y if implemented today. We conclude that globally coordinated pandemic prevention policies need to be enacted urgently to be optimally effective and that strategies to mitigate pandemics by reducing the impact of their underlying drivers are likely to be more effective than business as usual.","Pike, Jamison; Bogich, Tiffany; Elwood, Sarah; Finnoff, David C; Daszak, Peter",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1412661112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25512538/,12

Conflicting data have yet to elucidate optimal thromboprophylaxis dosing. HEP-COVID (NCT04401293) is a Phase 3, multicenter, pragmatic, prospective, randomized, pseudo-blinded, active control trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of therapeutic-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) versus prophylactic-/intermediate-dose LMWH or unfractionated heparin (UFH) for prevention of a primary efficacy composite outcome of VTE, ATE, and all-cause mortality (ACM) 30 ± 2 days post-enrollment. Eligible patients have COVID-19 diagnosis by nasal swab or serologic testing, requirement for supplemental oxygen per investigator judgment, and Dd >4x upper limit of normal (ULN) or sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score ≥4. Subjects are randomized to enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SQ/BID (CrCl ≥ 30 ml/min) or 0.5 mg/kg (CrCl 15-30 ml/min) vs local institutional prophylactic regimens including: a) UFH up to 22,500 IU daily (divided BID or TID), b) enoxaparin 30mg and 40mg SQ QD or BID, or c) dalteparin 2500IU or 5000 IU QD.

The optimal investigation of NVH is unclear, given the incidence of cancer and the public health implications of testing all individuals with this finding. OBJECTIVE We review contemporary literature to determine the association of NVH with the diagnosis of bladder cancer (BC), upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), and kidney cancer (KC). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION A systematic review of original articles in English was completed in May 2019. Meta-analyses for the diagnostic accuracy of NVH and urine cytology were performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS We screened 1529 articles and selected 78 manuscripts that fulfilled our inclusion criteria for narrative synthesis. Forty manuscripts were eligible for a meta-analysis (reporting 19 193 persons). The likelihood of a urological cancer in patients with NVH increased with age (<1% in those aged <40yr), male sex, and cigarette smoking. Less than 1% of patients are found to have a urological cancer after a negative NVH evaluation. Cancer detection rates in individuals evaluated for NVH ranged from 0% to 16% for BC in 37 studies, 0% to 3.5% for UTUC in 30 studies, and 0% to 9.7% for KC in 29 studies. Substantial statistical heterogeneity was present for the meta-analysis of detection rates. CONCLUSIONS We present an up-to-date review of the association of NVH with the diagnosis of BC, UTUC, and KC. Individuals with dipstick positive haematuria aged ≥40yr, who have had potential precipitating causes excluded, should undergo an evaluation. Re-evaluation of patients with unremarkable initial investigations should be performed in high-risk patients or if new symptoms occur.

Consequently, health care professionals from minority groups and lower socio-economic backgrounds are under-represented in the workforce. APPROACH The Socioeconomic Equity (EQ) support programme aims to increase the participation, retention and academic success of students from low socio-economic communities studying in health professional programmes at the University of Otago. At the start of the academic year, students who had attended a secondary school from a low socio-economic community were invited to take part in the EQ Programme. This includes group workshops on study skills, guidance from peer mentors, subject specific academic support, one-on-one course advice and pastoral support and activities to enhance self-esteem and self-efficacy. EVALUATION Comparing the first two years of the EQ project with the previous year, there was an increase in the percentage of students from schools in low socio-economic communities that passed HSFY. It was also found that more EQ students were offered places in health professional programmes than in the previous year. IMPLICATIONS The percentage of students passing HSFY has increased, and importantly, the percentage of students from low socio-economic backgrounds entering professional health programmes has doubled. This is a small start to building a health workforce that fairly reflects people from all communities.","Thomson, Rob; Baxter, Joanne; Bristowe, Zoë; Crampton, Peter; Rangi, Ana; Spears, Angela",The clinical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1111/tct.13409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34448538/,12

In creating these new formulations, the paradigm of drug development target should be introduced. Biological targets relating to the nature of addiction may pose insurmountable hurdles based on our current knowledge and technology, but products that use behavioral targets seem logical and feasible. The population of opioid abusers is large and diverse so behavioral targets are more challenging than they appear at first glance. Furthermore, we need to find ways to correlate behavioral observations of drug liking to actual use and abuse patterns. This may involve revisiting some pharmacodynamic concepts in light of drug effect rather than peak concentration. In this paper we present several new opioid analgesic agents designed to resist or deter abuse using physical barriers, the inclusion of an opioid agonist or antagonist, an aversive agent, and a prodrug formulation. Further, this paper also provides insight into the challenges facing drug discovery in this field. Designing and screening for opioids intended to resist or deter abuse is an important step to meet the public health challenge of burgeoning prescription opioid abuse.","Raffa, Robert B; Pergolizzi, Joseph V; Muñiz, Edmundo; Taylor, Robert; Pergolizzi, Jason",Pain research and treatment,https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/282981; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23213510/,12

All components were designed to measure the skills and knowledge required to perform safe flexible endoscopy. The purpose of this multicenter study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the hands-on component of the FES examination, and to establish the pass score. METHODS Expert endoscopists identified the critical skill set required for flexible endoscopy. They were then modeled in a virtual reality simulator (GI Mentor™ II, Simbionix™ Ltd., Airport City, Israel) to create five tasks and metrics. Scores were designed to measure both speed and precision. Validity evidence was assessed by correlating performance with self-reported endoscopic experience (surgeons and gastroenterologists [GIs]). Internal consistency of each test task was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Test-retest reliability was determined by having the same participant perform the test a second time and comparing their scores. Passing scores were determined by a contrasting groups methodology and use of receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS A total of 160 participants (17 % GIs) performed the simulator test. Scores on the five tasks showed good internal consistency reliability and all had significant correlations with endoscopic experience. Total FES scores correlated 0.73, with participants' level of endoscopic experience providing evidence of their validity, and their internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) was 0.82. Test-retest reliability was assessed in 11 participants, and the intraclass correlation was 0.85. The passing score was determined and is estimated to have a sensitivity (true positive rate) of 0.81 and a 1-specificity (false positive rate) of 0.21. CONCLUSIONS The FES hands-on skills test examines the basic procedural components required to perform safe flexible endoscopy. It meets rigorous standards of reliability and validity required for high-stakes examinations, and, together with the knowledge component, may help contribute to the definition and determination of competence in endoscopy.","Vassiliou, Melina C; Dunkin, Brian J; Fried, Gerald M; Mellinger, John D; Trus, Thadeus; Kaneva, Pepa; Lyons, Calvin; Korndorffer, James R; Ujiki, Michael; Velanovich, Vic; Kochman, Michael L; Tsuda, Shawn; Martinez, Jose; Scott, Daniel J; Korus, Gary; Park, Adrian; Marks, Jeffrey M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3298-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24253562/,12

Spacers of different lengths (ethyl and butyl) were introduced between the chelators and thymidine. The derivatives were labeled with the [Re(CO)(2)(NO)](2+) and [Re(CO)(3)](+) cores to give isostructural complexes with different overall charges. All complexes were analyzed by NMR, MS, and IR, and in addition, the X-ray structure of a [Re(CO)(2)(NO)](2+) labeled thymidine derivative functionalized at the N3 position was solved. The ligands incorporating the potentially tetradentate mercaptoethyliminodiacetic acid chelating system coordinated tridentately through iminodiacetic acid to both the [Re(CO)(2)(NO)](2+) core and the [Re(CO)(3)](+) core. This was surprising given that the reaction of [NEt(4)][Re(CO)(2)(NO)Br(3)] with the model ligand ethylmercaptoethyliminodiacetic acid led to dissociation of a carbonyl ligand and formation of a monocarbonyl-mononitrosyl complex, as confirmed by X-ray structure analysis. All of the organometallic thymidine derivatives were substrates for human thymidine kinase 1, a key enzyme in (cancer) cell proliferation. Neutral [Re(CO)(2)(NO)](2+) labeled thymidine derivatives revealed substrate activity ranging from 24 to 40%, and the structurally analogous anionic [Re(CO)(3)](+) labeled thymidine derivatives from 20 to 38% compared with the natural substrate thymidine.","Struthers, Harriet; Hagenbach, Adelheid; Abram, Ulrich; Schibli, Roger",Inorganic chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/ic9000126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19400575/,12

Intravenous administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator given within 4.5 hours is now standard treatment for this condition. Percutaneous vascular interventions use an intra-arterial, mechanical approach for thrombus disruption or removal (thrombectomy). Recent randomised trials indicate that percutaneous vascular interventions are superior to usual care (usual care usually included intravenous thrombolysis). However, intravenous thrombolysis was usually given in both arms of the trial and there was a lack of direct comparison of percutaneous vascular interventions with intravenous thrombolysis. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous vascular interventions compared with intravenous thrombolytic treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last search: August 2018). In addition, in September 2017, we searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Science Citation Index; and Stroke Trials Registry, and US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that directly compared a percutaneous vascular intervention with intravenous thrombolytic treatment in people with acute ischaemic stroke. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We obtained both published and unpublished data. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We included four trials with 450 participants. Data on functional outcome and death at end of follow-up were available for 443 participants from three trials. Compared with intravenous thrombolytic therapy, percutaneous vascular intervention did not improve the proportion of participants with good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2, risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.25, P = 0.92). The quality of evidence was low (outcome assessment was blinded, but not the treating physician or participants). At the end of follow-up, there was a non-significant increase in the proportion of participants who died in the percutaneous vascular intervention group (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.14, P = 0.21). The quality of evidence was low (wide confidence interval). There was no difference in the proportion of participants with symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages between the intervention and control groups (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.95, P = 0.97). The quality of evidence was low (wide confidence interval). Data on vascular status (recanalisation rate) were only available for seven participants from one trial; we considered this inadequate for statistical analyses. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The present review directly compared intravenous thrombolytic treatment with percutaneous vascular interventions for ischaemic stroke. We found no evidence from RCTs that percutaneous vascular interventions are superior to intravenous thrombolytic treatment with respect to functional outcome. Quality of evidence was low (outcome assessment was blinded, but not the treating physician or participants). New trials with adequate sample sizes are warranted because of the rapid development of new techniques and devices for such interventions.","Lindekleiv, Haakon; Berge, Eivind; Bruins Slot, Karsten Mh; Wardlaw, Joanna M",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd009292.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30365156/,12

74372,Characterization of a model of systemic inflammation in humans in vivo elicited by continuous infusion of endotoxin.,2017,"BACKGROUND Systematic information retrieval generally requires a two-step selection process for studies, which is conducted by two persons independently of one another (double-screening approach). To increase efficiency, two methods seem promising, which will be tested in the planned study: the use of text mining to prioritize search results as well as the involvement of only one person in the study selection process (single-screening approach). The aim of the present study is to examine the following questions related to the process of study selection: Can the use of the Rayyan or EPPI Reviewer tools to prioritize the results of study selection increase efficiency? How accurately does a single-screening approach identify relevant studies? Which advantages or disadvantages (e.g., shortened screening time or increase in the number of full texts ordered) does a single-screening versus a double-screening approach have? METHODS Our study is a prospective analysis of study selection processes based on benefit assessments of drug and non-drug interventions. It consists of two parts: firstly, the evaluation of a single-screening approach based on a sample size calculation (11 study selection processes, including 33 single screenings) and involving different screening tools and, secondly, the evaluation of the conventional double-screening approach based on five conventional study selection processes. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of the single-screening versus the double-screening approach with regard to the outcomes ""number of full texts ordered"" and ""time required for study selection"" are analyzed. The previous work experience of the screeners is considered as a potential effect modifier. DISCUSSION No study comparing the features of prioritization tools is currently available. Our study can thus contribute to filling this evidence gap. This study is also the first to investigate a range of questions surrounding the screening process and to include an a priori sample size calculation, thus enabling statistical conclusions. In addition, the impact of missing studies on the conclusion of a benefit assessment is calculated.

In this short analysis, we combine publicly available cumulative case data from the ongoing outbreak with phenomenological modeling methods to conduct an early transmissibility assessment. Our model suggests that the basic reproduction number associated with the outbreak (at time of writing) may range from 2.0 to 3.1. Though these estimates are preliminary and subject to change, they are consistent with previous findings regarding the transmissibility of the related SARS-Coronavirus and indicate the possibility of epidemic potential.","Majumder, Maimuna S; Mandl, Kenneth D",SSRN,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3524675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32714102/,12

In the present study, we established a rat model of acute spinal cord injury by cerclage. The cerclage suture was released 8 or 72 hours later, to simulate decompression surgery. Neurological function was evaluated behaviorally for 3 weeks after surgery, and tumor necrosis factor α immunoreactivity and apoptosis were quantified in the region of injury. Rats that underwent decompression surgery had significantly weaker immunoreactivity of tumor necrosis factor α and significantly fewer apoptotic cells, and showed faster improvement of locomotor function than animals in which decompression surgery was not performed. Decompression at 8 hours resulted in significantly faster recovery than that at 72 hours. These data indicate that early decompression may improve neurological function after spinal cord injury by inhibiting the expression of tumor necrosis factor α.","Xie, Jia-Bing; Zhang, Xin; Li, Quan-Hui; Xu, Zhu-Jun",Neural regeneration research,https://doi.org/10.4103/1673-5374.152374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25883619/,12
74683,Cellular self-cannibalism helps immune cells fight the flu.,2021-01-07,"Nucleic acid detection techniques are always critical to diagnosis, especially in the background of the present coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Simple and rapid detection techniques with high sensitivity and specificity are always urgently needed. However, current nucleic acid detection techniques are still limited by traditional amplification and hybridization. To overcome this limitation, here we developed CRISPR-Cas9-assisted DNA detection (CADD). In this detection, a DNA sample is incubated with a pair of capture single guide RNAs (sgRNAs; sgRNAa and sgRNAb) specific to a target DNA, dCas9, a signal readout-related probe, and an oligo-coated solid support beads or microplate at room temperature (RT) for 15 min. During this incubation, the dCas9-sgRNA-DNA complex is formed and captured on solid support by the capture sequence of sgRNAa, and the signal readout-related probe is captured by the capture sequence of sgRNAb. Finally, the detection result is reported by a fluorescent or colorimetric signal readout. This detection was verified by detecting DNA of bacteria, cancer cells, and viruses. In particular, by designing a set of sgRNAs specific to 15 high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), the HPV infection in 64 clinical cervical samples was successfully detected by the method. All detections can be finished in 30 min at RT. This detection holds promise for rapid on-the-spot detection or point-of-care testing.","Xu, Xinhui; Luo, Tao; Gao, Jinliang; Lin, Na; Li, Weiwei; Xia, Xinyi; Wang, Jinke",The CRISPR journal,https://doi.org/10.1089/crispr.2020.0041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33346711/,12
75494,Lab-on-Chip Devices: Gaining Ground Losing Size.,2017,"Introduction Following the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, the Italian government adopted strict rules of lockdown and social distancing. The aim of our study was to assess admission rate for syncope leading to cardiac rhythm management (CRM) procedures in Campania, the third-most-populous region of Italy, during COVID-19 lockdown. Methods Data were sourced from 14 referral hospitals in Campania from 10th March to 4th May 2020 (lockdown period) and during the same period in 2019. Among consecutive patients hospitalized for CRM procedures during the two observational periods, we retrospectively evaluated those admitted for arrhythmogenic syncope. Admission rate and the type of hospital admission between the two observational periods were compared. Results Among 951 consecutive patients hospitalized for CRM procedures, 204 were admitted for arrhythmogenic syncope leading to CRM procedures. A significant increase in admission was shown in 2020 compared to 2019 (26.4% vs. 18.3%; P=0.003). Moreover, regarding the type of admission to hospitals, attendance at the emergency department (ED) significantly increased (83.5% vs. 56.1%; P<0.001); conversely, a significant decrease in urgent unplanned hospitalizations (6.2% vs. 35.5%; P<0.001) was observed during COVID-19 lockdown.

Evidence is scarce regarding disparities in telehealth utilization in the United States. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with telehealth utilization among US adults. Our data came from the Health, Ethnicity, and Pandemic Study, a nationally representative survey conducted in October 2020, with 2554 adults ≥ 18 and an oversample of racial/ethnic minorities. Telehealth utilization was measured as self-reported teleconsultation with providers via email, text message, phone, video, and remote patient monitoring during the pandemic. Logistic regressions were performed to examine the association between telehealth use and factors at the individual, household, and community levels. Overall, 43% of the sample reported having used telehealth, representing 114.5 million adults in the nation. East and Southeast Asians used telehealth less than non-Hispanic Whites (OR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8). Being uninsured (compared with private insurance: OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.8), and those with limited broadband coverage in the community (OR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8) were less likely to use telehealth.

Although safety and feasibility have been recently published, not data are available describing the significant challenges of establishing NMP programs outside clinical studies. We herein present our experience and propose a multidisciplinary approach for liver NMP in the clinical routine. METHODS AND RESULTS In February 2018, liver NMP was introduced for routine use in marginal organs, logistical challenges and complex recipients at our institution. In a multidisciplinary effort between transplant coordinators, perfusionists, transplant surgeons, anesthesia, nurses, blood bank as well as laboratory staff, a clinical routine was established and 34 NMP cases were performed without critical incidents or organ loss. Nine livers were discarded due to poor organ quality and function observed during NMP. Twenty-five livers were successfully transplanted after preservation of up to 38 hours. The ECD rate was 100% and 92% in discarded and transplanted livers. Nighttime procedures and parallel transplantations were eventually omitted. Graft and patient survival was 88% at 20 months. No cholangiopathy was observed despite the use of extended criteria donor organs in 92% of cases. CONCLUSION NMP in a multidisciplinary approach enables a safe prolongation of liver preservation and overnight organ care. A first field test of NMP indicates safety and benefit of this approach.","Cardini, Benno; Oberhuber, Rupert; Fodor, Margot; Hautz, Theresa; Margreiter, Christian; Resch, Thomas; Scheidl, Stefan; Maglione, Manuel; Bösmüller, Claudia; Mair, Harald; Frank, Marion; Augustin, Florian; Griesmacher, Andrea; Schennach, Harald; Martini, Judith; Breitkopf, Robert; Eschertzhuber, Stephan; Pajk, Werner; Obwegeser, Alois; Tilg, Herbert; Watson, Christopher; Öfner, Dietmar; Weissenbacher, Annemarie; Schneeberger, Stefan",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32371845/,12
76267,Endovascular treatment of carotid-cavernous fistulas.,2014,"INTRODUCTION Physical inactivity is known as a leading cause of mortality and tracks from childhood to adulthood. Many types of school-based single-component and multicomponent interventions to promote physical activity (PA) have been undertaken and evaluated, with mixed findings overall. Enlarging the intervention areas beyond the school setting is a promising approach. WHO's Health Promoting School (WHO HPS) framework is a holistic, setting-based approach where health is promoted through the whole school environment with links to other settings such as the home environment and wider community. In this paper, we outline our scoping review protocol to systematically review the published literature from the last 10 years to identify existing school-based interventions to promote PA and cardiorespiratory fitness among children aged 6-10 years old and to map intervention components according to the features of this framework. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review methodology framework will guide the conduct of this review. We will search Medline, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Sports Medicine & Education Index, Education Resources Information Centre and CENTRAL and hand search the reference lists of key studies to identify studies appropriate for inclusion. Any empirical study that evaluated the effectiveness of a school-based intervention promoting PA and/or cardiorespiratory fitness in children aged 6-10 years old will be included. Two reviewers will independently screen all abstracts and full texts for inclusion. One reviewer will extract general information, study characteristics and intervention contents to classify them according to the features of the WHO HPS framework. Results will be synthesised narratively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Findings will be disseminated in conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications. A condensed version of the results will be made available for the public. Stakeholder meetings will be arranged to discuss and disseminate the findings.","Brandes, Berit; Busse, Heide; Sell, Louisa; Christianson, Lara; Brandes, Mirko",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-037848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33028552/,12

76490,Experimental Evaluation of the Heat Sink Effect in Hepatic Microwave Ablation.,2015,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) blocks host mRNA nuclear export to the cytoplasm, and nonstructural protein (nsp) 1-beta of PRRSV has been identified as the protein disintegrating the nuclear pore complex. In the present study, the molecular basis for the inhibition of host mRNA nuclear export was investigated. Nucleoporin 62 (Nup62) was found to bind to nsp1-beta, and the region representing the C-terminal 328-522 residues of Nup62 was determined as the binding domain to nsp1-beta. The nsp1-beta L126A mutant in the SAP domain did not bind to Nup62, and in L126A-expressing cells, the host mRNA nuclear export occurred normally. The vL126A mutant PRRSV generated by reverse genetics replicated at a slower rate, and the titer was lower than wild-type virus. In nsp1-beta overexpressing cells or siRNA-mediated Nup62 knock-down cells, the viral protein synthesis increased. Notably, the production of type I interferons (IFNs-α/β), IFN-stimulated genes (PKR, OAS, Mx1, ISG15), IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) 1 and 2, and IFN regulatory factor 3 decreased in these cells. As consequence, the growth of vL126A mutant PRRSV was rescued to the level of wild-type PRRSV. These findings are attributed to the NPC disintegration by nsp1-beta, resulting in increased viral protein production and decreased host protein production including antiviral proteins in the cytoplasm. Our study reveals a new strategy of PRRSV for immune evasion and enhanced replication during infection.IMPORTANCEPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes PRRS and is known to effectively suppress host innate immunity. The PRRSV nsp1-beta protein blocks host mRNA nuclear export, which has been shown as one of the viral mechanisms for inhibition of antiviral protein production. The nsp1-beta binds to the cellular protein nucleoporin 62 (Nup62), and as consequence, the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is disintegrated and the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of host mRNAs and host proteins are blocked. We show the dual benefits of Nup62 and nsp1-beta binding for PRRSV replication; the inhibition of host antiviral protein expression and the exclusive usage of host translation machinery by the virus. Our study unveils a novel strategy of PRRSV for immune evasion and enhanced replication during infection.","Ke, Hanzhong; Han, Mingyuan; Kim, Jineui; Gustin, Kurt E; Yoo, Dongwan",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00469-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31043527/,12
76600,Autoimmune Hepatitis: Tolerogenic Immunological State During Pregnancy and Immune Escape in Post-partum.,2020,"Cortisol is involved in a broad range of physiological processes and enables animals to adapt to new situations and challenges. Diurnal fluctuations in circulating cortisol concentrations in elephants have been demonstrated based on samples from urine and saliva. The aims of this study were to demonstrate diurnal cortisol fluctuations based on blood samples and compare concentrations between seasons, species, and changes in reproductive hormone concentrations. Nine African (Loxodonta africana) and three Asian (Elephas maximus) elephants at two facilities in the United States were included in this study. Blood samples were collected every 2-3 h at one location and every 1-6 h at another. Peak serum concentrations of cortisol averaged 28 ng/ml for both African and Asian elephants, and diurnal cycles included a fivefold decrease from morning peak to evening nadir concentrations. Diurnal cortisol profiles varied uniquely among individual elephants. During the winter, nadir concentrations of cortisol were slightly higher, and the timing of peak concentrations was less predictable. There was no correlation between diurnal serum concentrations of progesterone and cortisol; however, a significant correlation (p = .02) was identified between serum concentrations of testosterone and cortisol when a time lag of ~2-3 h was considered. The physiological significance of the positive correlations between diurnal serum concentrations of cortisol and testosterone in male elephants remains to be determined. If cortisol concentrations are being used to evaluate elephant health or welfare, samples should be obtained at the same time each day to minimize variation due to diurnal fluctuations, and ideally seasonal variations and individuality in diurnal profiles should also be considered.","Bechert, Ursula; Hixon, Sean; Schmitt, Dennis",Zoo biology,https://doi.org/10.1002/zoo.21619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151451/,12

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing carfilzomib-based with non-carfilzomib-based regimens in MM to investigate the risk of kidney toxicity. Point estimates were pooled in the form of risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random-effects model. We identified four RCTs with 2954 patients. The median duration of treatment ranged from 16.3 to 88 weeks in carfilzomib arms. The cumulative rate of kidney toxicities in the carfilzomib arms was 21.3% for all grades and 8.3% for grades 3-5 toxicities, with acute kidney injury being the predominantly reported event. Patients receiving a carfilzomib-based regimen had a significantly higher risk of total kidney toxicity compared with those in the control arms, with pooled RR of 1.79 (95% CI, 1.43-2.23, p < 0.001) and 2.29 (95% CI, 1.59-3.30; p < 0.001), for all grades and grades 3-5 toxicities, respectively. Despite adjustment for the duration of exposure in treatment arms, pooled incidence rate ratios (IRR) for kidney toxicity was significantly increased in the carfilzomib arm compared with control (pooled IRR of 1.28 for all grades and 1.66 for grades 3-5 toxicity). Subgroup analysis based on carfilzomib dose, infusion length, and treatment setting did not identify any significant subgroup effect. Kidney toxicity is an important adverse effect of carfilzomib-based regimens. Prospective studies should investigate patient-, disease-, and treatment-related risk factors for severe kidney toxicities and impact on long-term outcome.","Ball, Somedeb; Behera, Tapas Ranjan; Anwer, Faiz; Chakraborty, Rajshekhar",Annals of hematology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00277-020-04062-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32382772/,12

Fine particles are, in fact, those most capable of penetrating in depth into the respiratory system. People spend most of their time indoors where concentrations of some pollutants are sometimes higher than outdoors. Therefore, there is the need to ensure a healthy indoor environment and for this purpose the use of an air purifier can be a valuable aid especially now since it was demonstrated that indoor air quality has a high impact on spreading of viral infections such as that due to SARS-COVID19. In this study, we tested a commercial system that can be used as an air purifier. In particular it was verified its efficiency in reducing concentrations of PM10 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm), PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm), PM1 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 1 μm), and particle number in the range 0.3 μm -10 μm. Furthermore, its capacity in reducing VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) concentration was also checked. PM measurements were carried out by means of a portable optical particle counter (OPC) instrument simulating the working conditions typical of a household environment. In particular we showed that the tested air purifier significantly reduced both PM10 and PM2.5 by 16.8 and 7.25 times respectively that corresponds to a reduction of over 90% and 80%. A clear reduction of VOCs concentrations was also observed since a decrease of over 50% of these gaseous substances was achieved.","Fermo, Paola; Artíñano, Begoña; De Gennaro, Gianluigi; Pantaleo, Antonio Marco; Parente, Alessandro; Battaglia, Fiorella; Colicino, Elena; Di Tanna, Gianluca; Goncalves da Silva Junior, Andouglas; Pereira, Igor Gadelha; Garcia, Gabriel Santos; Garcia Goncalves, Luiz Marcos; Comite, Valeria; Miani, Alessandro",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33865819/,12
77777,The challenge of discovering beneficial viruses.,2009,"People are assumed to represent themselves in terms of body ownership and agency. Studies using the rubber- or virtual-hand illusion have assessed ownership and agency by means of explicit ownership and agency ratings and implicit measures, like proprioceptive drift in the case of ownership. These measures often show similar effects but also some discrepancies, suggesting that they rely on data sources that overlap, but not completely. To systematically assess commonalities and discrepancies, we adopted an immersed virtual hand illusion (VHI) design, in which three independent factors were manipulated: the synchrony between the movement of real and virtual effector, the type of effector, which was a virtual hand or triangle, and the spatial congruency between the real and virtual effector. Commonalities and discrepancies in the effects of these factors were assessed by crossing explicit and implicit measures for ownership and agency. While standard ratings were used as explicit measures, implicit ownership was assessed by means of proprioceptive drift and implicit agency by means of intentional binding. Results showed similar effect patterns for the two agency measures, which, however, were not correlated, different effect patterns for the two ownership measures, and a strong correlation between the two explicit measures. Taken altogether, our findings suggest that explicit and implicit measures of ownership and agency partly rely on shared informational sources, but seem to differ with respect to other sources that are integrated or with respect to the processed dimension (shape vs. time). The findings also suggest that some findings obtained with RHI designs might reflect more the unnatural situation that that design puts individuals into rather than generalizable mechanisms of computing perceived ownership and agency.","Ma, Ke; Qu, Jue; Yang, Liping; Zhao, Wenwen; Hommel, Bernhard",Experimental brain research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-021-06125-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974114/,12

Three months later, it became a severe pandemic. OBJECTIVE To identify scientific evidence on the use of face shields by health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic period. METHOD An integrative literature review of articles obtained from PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science databases was undertaken. For the search, controlled, non-controlled descriptors and specific keywords: ""face shield,"" ""fluid resistance procedure,"" ""respiratory infections,"" ""healthcare workers,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""aerosols,"" and ""personal protection infection"" were used. RESULTS The sample comprised seven studies. The available evidence has shown that face shields do not have a defined standard for their production-their effectiveness depends on the quality of the visor, structure, and fixation system. They must be used as adjuvants to other personal protective equipment (PPE), and their isolated use is not recommended due to the fragilities of peripheral face sealing, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic period. CONCLUSION Due to the shortage of this equipment, domestic face shields can be indicated if they meet production requirements, based on scientific evidence for their efficient use.","de Oliveira E Silva, Ana Cristina; Nogueira, Wynne Pereira; Gir, Elucir; de Almeida, Sandra Aparecida; de Lima Barroso, Bárbara Iansã; Freire, Maria Eliane Moreira",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-210542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34633340/,12

METHODS In 43 cases of suspected fetal growth restriction (FGR), serial Doppler measurements of umbilical artery (UA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) pulsatility index (PI) were performed. The last measurement, closest to delivery (< 1 week before birth), was used for analysis. Neonatal circulation was assessed for 2 h/day on Days 1-5, 8 and 15 by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) of the cerebral, renal and splanchnic regions. We calculated fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) as: (arterial oxygen saturation - NIRS value)/arterial oxygen saturation. The following ratios were calculated: cerebroplacental ratio (CPR; MCA-PI/UA-PI), cerebrorenal ratio (CRR; cerebral/renal FTOE) and cerebrosplanchnic ratio (CSR; cerebral/splanchnic FTOE). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (ρ) was calculated between prenatal Doppler parameters and neonatal NIRS variables. These analyses were carried out for the entire group, and separately for cases of early FGR (delivered < 34 weeks) and late FGR (≥ 34 weeks). RESULTS Fetal Doppler parameters correlated with neonatal NIRS variables on Days 1-3: UA-PI correlated with renal FTOE (Day 1: ρ = 0.454, P < 0.01) and CRR (Day 1: ρ = -0.517, P < 0.001). MCA-PI correlated with cerebral FTOE on Day 2 (ρ = 0.469, P < 0.01), approached statistical significance on Day 3 but was not correlated on Day 1. CPR correlated with CRR (Day 1: ρ = 0.474, P < 0.01). Most associations lost their statistical significance when early and late FGR subgroups were considered separately. CONCLUSION Low MCA-PI and low CPR, indicating brain sparing before birth, are associated with low CRR after birth, indicating relatively greater blood flow to the cerebrum than to the renal region. Based on the results of this study, it could be speculated that if brain sparing is present in the fetal circulation, it persists during the first 3 days after birth. Copyright © 2015 ISUOG.

New imaging technologies can help us find out.,2020-07-27,"SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on binding its spike (S) protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein expresses an RGD motif, suggesting that integrins may be co-receptors. Here, we UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and fluorescently labeled the envelope membrane with octadecyl rhodamine B (R18) to explore the role of integrin activation in mediating cell entry and productive infection. We used flow cytometry and confocal microscopy to show that SARS-CoV-2R18 particles engage basal-state integrins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Mn2+, which induces integrin extension, enhances cell entry of SARS-CoV-2R18. We also show that one class of integrin antagonist, which binds to the αI MIDAS site and stabilizes the inactive, closed conformation, selectively inhibits the engagement of SARS-CoV-2R18 with basal state integrins, but is ineffective against Mn2+-activated integrins. RGD-integrin antagonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2R18 binding regardless of integrin activation status. Integrins transmit signals bidirectionally: 'inside-out' signaling primes the ligand-binding function of integrins via a talin-dependent mechanism, and 'outside-in' signaling occurs downstream of integrin binding to macromolecular ligands. Outside-in signaling is mediated by Gα13. Using cell-permeable peptide inhibitors of talin and Gα13 binding to the cytoplasmic tail of an integrin's β subunit, we demonstrate that talin-mediated signaling is essential for productive infection.","Simons, Peter; Rinaldi, Derek A; Bondu, Virginie; Kell, Alison M; Bradfute, Steven; Lidke, Diane S; Buranda, Tione",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99893-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34650161/,12

First, private property and the notion of ""ownership"" embedded in ""self-ownership,"" rely on and replicate historical injustices related to the initial acquisition of property. Second, not all individuals are recognized as selves with equal access to self-ownership. Third, self-ownership only justifies negative liberties. To fully protect healthcare access and reproductive care in specific, we must also be able to make claims on others to respect, protect, and fulfill our positive rights. As much as nondomination remains an urgent demand for reproductive rights, it does not go far enough to ensure reproductive justice.","Lanphier, Elizabeth",Cambridge quarterly of healthcare ethics : CQ : the international journal of healthcare ethics committees,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0963180120000869; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33764292/,12

This powerful technique does not only provide valuable insights into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, i.e., the etiopathogenesis of CNS related diseases, it also facilitates the development of new translational, i.e., therapeutic approaches. Whereas competing techniques that make use of recorder systems used in jackets or tethered systems suffer from their unphysiological restraining to semi-restraining character, radiotelemetric EEG recordings overcome these disadvantages. Technically, implantable EEG radiotelemetry allows for precise and highly sensitive measurement of epidural and deep, intracerebral EEGs under various physiological and pathophysiological conditions. First, we present a detailed protocol of a straight forward, successful, quick and efficient technique for epidural (surface) EEG recordings resulting in high-quality electrocorticograms. Second, we demonstrate how to implant deep, intracerebral EEG electrodes, e.g., in the hippocampus (electrohippocampogram). For both approaches, a computerized 3D stereotaxic electrode implantation system is used. The radiofrequency transmitter itself is implanted into a subcutaneous pouch in both mice and rats. Special attention also has to be paid to pre-, peri- and postoperative treatment of the experimental animals. Preoperative preparation of mice and rats, suitable anesthesia as well as postoperative treatment and pain management are described in detail.","Papazoglou, Anna; Lundt, Andreas; Wormuth, Carola; Ehninger, Dan; Henseler, Christina; Soós, Julien; Broich, Karl; Weiergräber, Marco",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/54216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27404845/,12

Recent studies prove that the new technique can be a safe alternative to multiport laparoscopy; therefore it is becoming more and more popular. AIM We present our preliminary experience with single incision laparoscopy of the spleen. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyse a group of 9 patients (7 women and 2 men) in whom we attempted single incision laparoscopic surgery of the spleen. RESULTS Single incision laparoscopy was successful in all patients - in 7 of them we performed splenectomy and in 2 unroofing of the splenic cyst. Additionally, in 3 patients we performed concomitant cholecystectomy. The operative technique was identical to multiport procedures. One patient required reoperation due to intra-abdominal bleeding from the wound on the first postoperative day. In one patient due to superficial injury of the stomach wall continuous suture was used to prevent perforation. In our opinion these complications are not the result of the new technique. CONCLUSIONS The described technique can become a safe alternative to multiport laparoscopy. It is a reasonable alternative in young patients to whom an excellent cosmetic effect is particularly important because until now it is the only documented advantage of this surgical technique.","Pędziwiatr, Michał; Matłok, Maciej; Major, Piotr; Kuliś, Daria; Budzyński, Andrzej",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2011.30826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23630548/,12

METHODS We evaluated 175 consecutive patients with HCC (single nodule, tumor diameter ≤ 30 mm) who underwent surgical resection (146 received partial resection) and 313 patients who received RFA; 277 patients received touch ablation using a monopolar or bipolar RFA device, and 36 received no-touch ablation using a bipolar RFA device. Pretreatment arterial and portal phase dynamic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images were classified into four enhancement patterns: Type 1 and Type 2 are homogeneous enhancement patterns without or with increased arterial blood flow, respectively; Type 3 is a heterogeneous enhancement pattern with a septum-like structure; and Type 4 is an irregularly shaped ring structure enhancement pattern. RESULTS Cumulative recurrence rates significantly differed between procedures (surgical resection, 7.5%; no-touch ablation, 2.9%; and touch ablation, 17.7% at the third year; P = 0.005). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that enhancement pattern type (Type 3: hazard ratio [HR], 2.95; P = 0.002; and Type 4: HR, 3.88, P = 0.002), treatment procedure (touch ablation: HR, 3.36; P < 0.001), and serum α-fetoprotein level (≥30 μg/L: HR, 1.87; P = 0.009) were significant predictors of intrasubsegmental recurrence. No significant differences between no-touch ablation and surgical resection were observed. CONCLUSION The no-touch pincer ablation procedure has the potential to prevent intrasubsegmental recurrence after RFA for patients with HCC to the same degree as partial resection.","Kawamura, Yusuke; Ikeda, Kenji; Shindoh, Junichi; Kobayashi, Yuta; Kasuya, Kayoko; Fujiyama, Shunichiro; Hosaka, Tetsuya; Kobayashi, Masahiro; Saitoh, Satoshi; Sezaki, Hitomi; Akuta, Norio; Suzuki, Fumitaka; Suzuki, Yoshiyuki; Arase, Yasuji; Hashimoto, Masaji; Kumada, Hiromitsu",Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/hepr.13254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30277295/,12

METHODS In a retrospective study of a prospectively developed and maintained database, all patients diagnosed with FS before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were studied at the outpatient epilepsy clinic at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, from December 2008 until February 2021. RESULTS Three hundred and eighty-eight patients were studied. Three hundred and sixty-four patients (94%) were diagnosed before and 24 persons (6%) during the pandemic. Patients diagnosed during the COVID-19 pandemic less frequently had generalized motor seizures [odds ratio (OR): 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.12-0.77; p = 0.012] and had higher seizure frequencies (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 1.00-1.01; p = 0.044).

Although survival-related traits often trade off with reproduction, survival-related traits themselves may trade off with each other under energy limitation. Whole-organism performance and the immune system both enhance survival, yet are costly, but it is unclear how the two might trade off with each other under energy-limited conditions. Resources may be allocated to very different types of performance (e.g., aerobic endurance versus anaerobic sprinting) just as they may be allocated to different components of the immune system (e.g., innate versus acquired) to maximize survival. We forced allocation to different performance traits in green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis), using specialized exercise training, to determine how different components of the immune system would be impacted by shifts in energy use. We measured immunocompetence in endurance trained, sprint trained, and untrained control lizards with the swelling response to phytohemagglutinin (cell-mediated), antibody response to sheep red blood cells (acquired humoral), and wound healing (integrated). Endurance-trained lizards had reduced cell-mediated immunity, whereas sprint-trained lizards had reduced rates of wound healing. The acquired immune response was not affected by either type of training. Because each immune measure responded differently to the different types of training, our results do not support the hypothesis that simple energy limitation determines overall investment in immunity. Instead, different components of the immune system appear to be affected in ways specific to how energy is invested in performance.","Wang, Andrew Z; Husak, Jerry F",The Journal of experimental biology,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.232132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917817/,12

This article examines how community psychology has discussed equity thus far to identify strengths and gaps for future research and practice. The results showed the prominence of community-based participatory research and the diversity of settings researchers work in.

83731,Therapy with CTLA4-Ig and an antiviral monoclonal antibody controls chikungunya virus arthritis.,2017,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Post hoc analyses of randomized controlled clinical trials evaluating mechanical thrombectomy have suggested that admission-to-groin-puncture (ATG) delays are associated with reduced reperfusion rates. Purpose of this analysis was to validate this association in a real-world cohort and to find associated factors and confounders for prolonged ATG intervals. METHODS Patients included into the BEYOND-SWIFT cohort (Bernese-European Registry for Ischemic Stroke Patients Treated Outside Current Guidelines With Neurothrombectomy Devices Using the Solitaire FR With the Intention for Thrombectomy; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03496064) were analyzed (n=2386). Association between baseline characteristics and ATG was evaluated using mixed linear regression analysis. The effect of increasing symptom-onset-to-admission and ATG intervals on successful reperfusion (defined as Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [TICI] 2b-3) was evaluated using logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS Median ATG was 73 minutes. Prolonged ATG intervals were associated with the use of magnetic resonance imaging (+19.1 [95% CI, +9.1 to +29.1] minutes), general anesthesia (+12.1 [95% CI, +3.7 to +20.4] minutes), and borderline indication criteria, such as lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, late presentations, or not meeting top-tier early time window eligibility criteria (+13.8 [95% CI, +6.1 to +21.6] minutes). There was a 13% relative odds reduction for TICI 2b-3 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.87 [95% CI, 0.79-0.96]) and TICI 2c/3 (aOR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.79-0.95]) per hour ATG delay, while the reduction of TICI 2b-3 per hour increase symptom-onset-to-admission was minor (aOR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.94-0.99]) and inconsistent regarding TICI 2c/3 (aOR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.97-1.02]). After adjusting for identified factors associated with prolonged ATG intervals, the association of ATG delay and lower rates of TICI 2b-3 remained tangible (aOR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.76-0.99]). CONCLUSIONS There is a great potential to reduce ATG, and potential targets for improvement can be deduced from observational data. The association between in-hospital delay and reduced reperfusion rates is evident in real-world clinical data, underscoring the need to optimize in-hospital workflows. Given the only minor association between symptom-onset-to-admission intervals and reperfusion rates, the causal relationship of this association warrants further research.

84151,Cellular inflammatory response to flaviviruses in the central nervous system of a primate host.,2009,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The present review aims to propose pharmacological strategies to enhance current clinical practices for analgesia in ambulatory surgical settings and in the context of the opioid epidemic. RECENT FINDINGS Each year, a high volume of patients undergoes ambulatory surgery worldwide. The multimodal analgesia proposed to ambulatory patients must provide the best analgesic effect and patient satisfaction while respecting the rules of safety for ambulatory surgery. The role of nurses, anesthesiologists, and surgeons around said surgery is to relieve suffering, achieve early mobilization and patient satisfaction, and reduce duration of stay in hospital. Currently, and particularly in North America, overprescription of opioids has reached a critical level constituting a 'crisis'. Thus, we see the need to offer more optimal multimodal analgesia strategies to ambulatory patients. SUMMARY These strategies must combine three key components when not contraindicated: regional/local analgesia, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Adjuvants such as gabapentinoids, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulators, glucocorticoids, α2-adrenergic receptor agonists, intravenous lidocaine might be added to the initial multimodal strategy, however, caution must be used regarding their side effects and risks of delaying recovery after ambulatory surgery. Weaker opioids (e.g. oxycodone, hydrocodone, tramadol) could be used rather than more powerful ones (e.g. morphine, hydromorphone, inhaled fentanyl, sufentanil). This, combined with education about postoperative weaning of opioids after surgery must be done in order to avoid long-term reliance of these drugs.","Richebé, Philippe; Brulotte, Véronique; Raft, Julien",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567512/,12

Purpose To assess the comparative efficacy and safety of basal insulin analogues for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Data Sources Several databases from inception to April 2018 without language restrictions, ClinicalTrials.gov to April 2018, references of reviews, and meeting abstract books. Study Selection Randomized trials lasting at least 12 weeks that compared efficacy (change in hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] level from baseline [primary outcome]; percentage of patients with HbA1c level <7% at end of study and change in body weight [secondary outcomes]) and safety (hypoglycemia) of basal insulin analogues. Data Extraction Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for each outcome. All authors evaluated overall confidence in the evidence. Data Synthesis Thirty-nine trials (26 195 patients) assessed 10 basal insulin analogues. Low- to very-low-quality evidence indicated that thrice-weekly degludec (Deg-3TW) was inferior to most other regimens for reducing HbA1c level, with mean differences ranging from 0.21% (vs. degludec, 100 U/mL [Deg-100]) to 0.32% (vs. glargine, 300 U/mL [Glar-300]). High- to moderate-quality evidence suggested that detemir had a favorable weight profile versus all comparators, and Glar-300 was associated with less weight gain than glargine, 100 U/mL (Glar-100); Deg-100; degludec, 200 U/mL (Deg-200); Deg-3TW; and LY2963016. Low- and very-low-quality evidence suggested that Deg-100, Deg-200, and Glar-300 were associated with lower incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia than detemir, Glar-100, LY2963016, and neutral protamine lispro (NPL). Incidence of severe hypoglycemia did not differ among regimens, except NPL, which was associated with increased risk versus Deg-100, detemir, Glar-100, and Glar-300. Limitations Results are based mostly on indirect comparisons. Confidence in summary estimates is low or very low due to individual-study limitations, imprecision, or inconsistency. Conclusion Low-quality evidence suggests that basal insulin analogues for T2DM do not substantially differ in their glucose-lowering effect. Low- and very-low-quality evidence suggests some regimens may be associated with lower risk for nocturnal hypoglycemia (Deg-100, Deg-200, and Glar-300) or less weight gain (detemir and Glar-300).

Methods We searched online databases (CINAHL, Embase®, ERIC, MEDLINE®, ProQuest, PubMed® and Web of ScienceTM) for articles published between January 2000 and May 2018. Eligible studies evaluated the delivery of school-based eye-care programmes, reporting results in terms of spectacle compliance rates, quality of screening or attitude changes. We considered studies to be ineligible if no follow-up data were reported. Two authors screened titles, abstracts and full-text articles, and we extracted data from eligible full-text articles using the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality rights-based conceptual framework. Findings Of 24 559 publications screened, 48 articles from 13 countries met the inclusion criteria. Factors involved in the successful provision of school-based eye-care interventions included communication between health services and schools, the willingness of schools to schedule sufficient time, and the support of principals, staff and parents. Several studies found that where the numbers of eye-care specialists are insufficient, training teachers in vision screening enables the provision of a good-quality and cost-effective service. As well as the cost of spectacles, barriers to seeking eye-care included poor literacy, misconceptions and lack of eye health knowledge among parents. Conclusion The provision of school-based eye-care programmes has great potential to reduce ocular morbidity and developmental delays caused by childhood vision impairment and blindness. Policy-based support, while also attempting to reduce misconceptions and stigma among children and their parents, is crucial for continued access.","Burnett, Anthea M; Yashadhana, Aryati; Lee, Ling; Serova, Nina; Brain, Daveena; Naidoo, Kovin",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.18.212332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30455516/,12
85735,Measles-vectored vaccine approaches against viral infections: a focus on Chikungunya.,2019,"Overexpression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in several cancers is associated with resistance to therapy. Radionuclide molecular imaging of IGF-1R expression in tumors may help in selecting the patients that will potentially respond to IGF-1R-targeted therapy. Affibody molecules are small (7 kDa) non-immunoglobulin-based scaffold proteins that are well-suited probes for radionuclide imaging. The aim of this study was the evaluation of an anti-IGF-1R affibody molecule labeled with technetium-99m using cysteine-containing peptide-based chelator GGGC at C-terminus. ZIGF1R:4551-GGGC was efficiently and stably labeled with technetium-99m (radiochemical yield 97 ± 3%). (99m)Tc-ZIGF1R:4551-GGGC demonstrated specific binding to IGF-1R-expressing DU-145 (prostate cancer) and MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell lines and slow internalization in vitro. The tumor-targeting properties were studied in BALB/c nu/nu mice bearing DU-145 and MCF-7 xenografts. [(99m)Tc(CO)3](+)-(HE)3-ZIGF1R:4551 was used for comparison. The biodistribution study demonstrated high tumor-to-blood ratios (6.2 ± 0.9 and 6.9 ± 1.0, for DU-145 and MCF-7, respectively, at 4 h after injection). Renal radioactivity concentration was 16-fold lower for (99m)Tc-ZIGF1R:4551-GGGC than for [(99m)Tc(CO)3](+)-(HE)3-ZIGF1R:4551 at 4 h after injection. However, the liver uptake of (99m)Tc-ZIGF1R:4551-GGGC was 1.2- to 2-fold higher in comparison with [(99m)Tc(CO)3](+)-(HE)3-ZIGF1R:4551. A possible reason for the elevated hepatic uptake of (99m)Tc-ZIGF1R:4551-GGGC is a high lipophilicity of amino acids in the binding site of ZIGF1R:4551, which is not compensated in (99m)Tc-ZIGF1R:4551-GGGC. In conclusion, (99m)Tc-ZIGF1R:4551-GGGC can visualize the IGF-1R expression in human tumor xenografts and provides low retention of radioactivity in kidneys. Further development of this imaging agent should include molecular design aimed at reducing the hepatic uptake.","Mitran, Bogdan; Altai, Mohamed; Hofström, Camilla; Honarvar, Hadis; Sandström, Mattias; Orlova, Anna; Tolmachev, Vladimir; Gräslund, Torbjörn",Amino acids,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00726-014-1859-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25425114/,12

Ylanthia comprises 36 fixed immunoglobulin (Ig) variable heavy (VH)/variable light (VL) chain pairs, which cover a broad range of canonical complementarity-determining region (CDR) structures. The variable Ig heavy and Ig light (VH/VL) chain pairs were selected for biophysical characteristics favorable to manufacturing and development. The selection process included multiple parameters, e.g., assessment of protein expression yield, thermal stability and aggregation propensity in fragment antigen binding (Fab) and IgG1 formats, and relative Fab display rate on phage. The framework regions are fixed and the diversified CDRs were designed based on a systematic analysis of a large set of rearranged human antibody sequences. Care was taken to minimize the occurrence of potential posttranslational modification sites within the CDRs. Phage selection was performed against various antigens and unique antibodies with excellent biophysical properties were isolated.

86843,PGE2 displays immunosuppressive effects during human active tuberculosis.,2021-06-30,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW This article reviews infections of the brain parenchyma and includes an overview of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic approach, and management of infectious encephalitis and brain abscess. RECENT FINDINGS The epidemiology of infectious encephalitis and brain abscess has changed in recent years. Vaccination has reduced the incidence of certain viruses associated with encephalitis, while a decrease in fulminant otogenic infections has led to fewer brain abscesses associated with otitis media. However, changes in climate and human population density and distribution have enabled the emergence of newer pathogens and expanded the geographic range of others, and greater adoption of intensive immunosuppressive regimens for autoimmune conditions has increased the risk of opportunistic infections of the brain. The widespread use of early neuroimaging, along with improved diagnostic methodologies for pathogen detection, newer antimicrobial therapies with better brain penetration, and less invasive neurosurgical techniques, has resulted in better outcomes for patients with infectious encephalitis and brain abscess. Novel technologies including metagenomic next-generation sequencing are increasingly being applied to these conditions in an effort to improve diagnosis. Nevertheless, both infectious encephalitis and brain abscess continue to be associated with substantial mortality. SUMMARY Infectious encephalitis and brain abscess can present as neurologic emergencies and require rapid assessment, thorough and appropriate diagnostic testing, and early initiation of empiric therapies directed against infectious agents. Close clinical follow-up, proper interpretation of diagnostic results, and appropriate tailoring of therapeutic agents are essential to optimizing outcomes. Diagnosis and management of parenchymal brain infections are complex and often best achieved with a multidisciplinary care team involving neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, infectious disease physicians, and pathologists.","Venkatesan, Arun",Continuum,https://doi.org/10.1212/con.0000000000001006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34623096/,12

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to assess self-reported frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders in non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Poland. PATIENTS AND METHODS This cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 17 and 18, 2020, among 4,516 non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Poland. The questionnaire included eight questions related to the health status, symptoms of COVID-19, comorbidities, and smoking status. RESULTS Completed questionnaires were obtained from 1,942 patients with COVID-19, a response rate of 43%. The median age of the respondents was 50 years; 60.2% were women. Among non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 21.3% had hypertension, 4.5% had diabetes, and 3.1% of COVID-19 cases had chronic respiratory disease. Regular tobacco use was declared by 11.2% of patients with COVID-19. At least one gastrointestinal symptom was reported by 53.6% of patients. Almost half of patients (47%) with COVID-19 reported lack of appetite and 24.2% reported diarrhea. Among 1,942 interviewed patients, 54.2% reported at least one olfactory or taste disorder and 42.5% reported both alterations. Self-reported olfactory and taste disorders were 49.2% and 47.5%, respectively. Self-reported frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders during COVID-19 course was significantly higher (p<0.001) among women than men. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, this study demonstrated that olfactory and taste disorders are frequent symptoms in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients. Moreover, our study indicates gender differences in the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders among non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Sierpiński, Radosław; Pinkas, Jarosław; Jankowski, Mateusz; Zgliczyński, Wojciech S; Wierzba, Waldemar; Gujski, Mariusz; Szumowski, Łukasz",Polish archives of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.20452/pamw.15414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32491298/,12
87658,Experts' Perceptions on China's Capacity to Manage Emerging and Re-emerging Zoonotic Diseases in an Era of Climate Change.,2017,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Acute BAO is a devastating neurological condition associated with a poor clinical outcome and a high mortality rate. Recanalization has been identified as a major prognostic factor for good outcome in BAO. Mechanical thrombectomy using retrievable stents is an emerging treatment option for acute stroke. First clinical trials using stent retrievers have shown promising high recanalization rates. However, these studies mainly included large artery occlusions in the anterior circulation with only a few or single cases of BAO. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate technical feasibility, safety, and efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy using retrievable stent in the treatment of acute BAO. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fourteen consecutive patients with BAO undergoing endovascular therapy using retrievable stents (Solitaire FR Revascularization Device) were included. Additional multimodal treatment approaches included thromboaspiration, intravenous and/or intra-arterial thrombolysis, and PTA/ permanent stent placement. Recanalization rates after multimodal therapy and stent retrieval were determined. Clinical outcome and mortality were assessed 3 months after treatment. RESULTS Median patient age was 64.5 years (range 55-85). Median NIHSS score at presentation was 21 (range 5-36). Overall, successful recanalization (TICI 3 or 2b) was achieved in all patients (TICI 3 in 78.6%, 11/14). In 4 patients (28.6%), insufficient recanalization after stent retrieval was due to an underlying atherosclerotic stenosis. Additional deployment of a permanent intracranial stent was performed in 3 patients (21.4%) and PTA alone in 1 patient (7.1%), resulting in final TICI 3 in 1 patient and TICI 2b in 3 patients. Stent retrieval alone was performed in 4 patients (28.6%). Average number of device passes was 1.3 (range 1-3). Median procedure time to maximal recanalization was 47 minutes (range 10-252). No device-related complications or thromboembolic occlusion of a previously unaffected artery occurred. There was no symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. At 3 months, good functional outcome (mRS 0-2) was observed in 28.6% (4/14); overall mortality was 35.7% (5/14). CONCLUSIONS A multimodal endovascular approach using retrievable stents in BAO has high recanalization rates, with very low complication rates. Underlying atherothrombotic stenotic lesions of the basilar artery may still necessitate additional permanent stent placement to achieve complete recanalization.","Mordasini, P; Brekenfeld, C; Byrne, J V; Fischer, U; Arnold, M; Heldner, M R; Lüdi, R; Mattle, H P; Schroth, G; Gralla, J",AJNR.

This study presents an economic model to evaluate cost effectiveness of coronary stents. METHODS Markov modeling was developed comparing total costs (Medicare payer perspective) between TAXUS Liberté and TAXUS Express based on 3-year clinical outcomes from the TAXUS ATLAS Small Vessel and Long Lesion trials. RESULTS The TAXUS Liberté 2.25-mm stent provided cost savings relative to TAXUS Express from a payer perspective ($17,605 vs. $20,281), driven by reduced target vessel revascularization (0.16 events/patient vs. 0.33 events/patient). In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, TAXUS Liberté was less costly with fewer major adverse cardiac events in over 99% of parameter sets. The TAXUS Liberté Long (38 mm) stent was cost neutral relative to TAXUS Express from a payer perspective ($18,545 vs. $18,551) with fewer myocardial infarctions and cardiac deaths. Accounting for angiography-driven revascularizations, TAXUS Liberté 2.25 mm still provided cost savings relative to TAXUS Express ($16,822 vs. $19,139), although TAXUS Liberté Long was more expensive than TAXUS Express ($17,886 vs. $17,652). From a hospital perspective, TAXUS Liberté Long provided cost savings up to a price premium of $671/stent, driven by fewer stents employed per patient. CONCLUSIONS This analysis confirms the utility of economic modeling in assessing new stent platforms. TAXUS Liberté 2.25 mm is economically dominant relative to TAXUS Express when treating small vessels. TAXUS Liberté Long is cost neutral to modestly more costly than TAXUS Express 2.25 mm from a payer perspective.","Turco, Mark A; Kansal, Anuraag R; Stern, Sean; Amorosi, Stacey L; Underwood, Paul L; Lissovoy, Greg D E; Dawkins, Keith D",Journal of interventional cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-8183.2012.00737.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22612261/,12
88038,The Prognostic Relevance of Subcarinal Lymph Node Dissection in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,2016,"Dating back to the late 1980s, bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) are relatively new materials that exhibit exceptional mechanical properties (strength, hardness, fracture toughness, stored elastic energy ...), compared to those of most crystalline metallic alloys. Their apparent brittleness under uniaxial loading, however, is still a major obstacle to their industrialization. Moreover, BMGs often contain crystalline defects developed, intentionally or not, during their complex and delicate elaboration. These flaws are known to affect their fracture toughness and their plastic behaviour. This paper reviews twenty years of works about this subject on Zr-based bulk metallic glasses that may contain a low volume fraction of crystalline defects of different natures, e.g. dendrites or spherulites, depending on the synthesis method. Dedicated experimental set-ups, mainly bending tests on notched beams, were developed to create in the specimen a proper pre-crack by fatigue and then load it monotonically up to fracture. The measured fracture toughness and the fractographic observations allow to conclude that these crystalline defects facilitate pre-cracking, but result in an embrittlement that is more or less significant depending on their type. The loading mode of the crack -- mode I, II or mixed -- as well as the temperature were shown to play a key role in crack initiation and propagation, whether steadily or catastrophically, in the BMG. By means of finite element computations analyses, explanations on how the crystalline flaws presence can affect fracture toughness and perturbate crack growth, under mode I and mode II, were proposed.Finally, the relevance of these experimental techniques as well as the link between crystalline defects, fracture toughness and their consequences on the ductility of a structural component are discussed.","Bernard, Cédric; Keryvin, Vincent",Journal of physics.

Recently, pharmacogenetic biomarkers entered in prescribing guidelines, giving clinicians the possibility to use this additional tool to guide prescription and improve therapeutic outcomes. This marked an important step towards precision psychiatry, which aim is to integrate biological and environmental information to personalise treatments. Only genetic variants in cytochrome enzymes are endorsed by prescribing guidelines, but in the future polygenic predictors of treatment outcomes may be translated into the clinic. The integration of genetics with other relevant information (e.g., concomitant diseases and treatments, drug plasma levels) could be managed in a standardised way through ad hoc software. The overcoming of the current obstacles (e.g., staff training, genotyping and informatics facilities) can lead to a broad implementation of precision psychiatry and represent a revolution for psychiatric care. Key points Precision psychiatry aims to integrate biological and environmental information to personalise treatments and complement clinical judgement Pharmacogenetic biomarkers in cytochrome genes were included in prescribing guidelines and represented an important step towards precision psychiatry Therapeutic drug monitoring is an important and cost-effective tool which should be integrated with genetic testing and clinical evaluation in order to optimise pharmacotherapy Other individual factors relevant to pharmacotherapy response (e.g., individual's symptom profile, concomitant diseases) can be integrated with genetic information through artificial intelligence to provide treatment recommendations The creation of pharmacogenetic services within healthcare systems is a challenging and multi-step process, education of health professionals, promotion by institutions and regulatory bodies, economic and ethical barriers are the main issues.","Zanardi, Raffaella; Prestifilippo, Dario; Fabbri, Chiara; Colombo, Cristina; Maron, Eduard; Serretti, Alessandro",International journal of psychiatry in clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1080/13651501.2020.1809680; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32852246/,12

89445,ACE2 as therapeutic agent.,2020-10-16,"Given the devastating consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on all of us, the question arises as to whether manipulating the cellular degradation (recycling, waste disposal) mechanism known as macroautophagy/autophagy (in particular, the selective degradation of virus particles, termed virophagy) might be a beneficial approach to fight the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Knowing that ""autophagy can reprocess everything"", it seems almost inevitable that, sooner rather than later, a further hypothesis-driven work will detail the role of virophagy as a fundamental ""disposal strategy"" against COVID-19, yielding most needed therapeutic interventions.

89521,Principles of clinical ethics and their application to practice.,2020-06-04,"INTRODUCTION Those with metastatic urothelial carcinoma generally respond more poorly to chemotherapy after they have progression on a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI). There is interest in combining CPIs with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies as a strategy to exploit the efficacy and immunomodulatory effects of chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a single institution, retrospective analysis including all patients treated between May 2018 and May 2020 with carboplatin and paclitaxel, concurrently or sequential with pembrolizumab, after having progression on a CPI alone. Clinical characteristics, response by RECIST 1.1, progression-free survival, and safety/tolerance of the treatment are reported. RESULTS Median age was 80 years (64-85). Five patients (100%) had visceral metastases when starting carboplatin and paclitaxel. Chemotherapy was given with concurrent pembrolizumab (four patients) or following pembrolizumab (one patient) and continued until maximum response, significant toxicity, or progression. Two patients subsequently remained on maintenance pembrolizumab. There were four partial responses and one patient with stable disease. All patients on follow-up have progressed with median time to progression of 47 weeks (18-75). Two patients died from disease progression. CONCLUSIONS This case series suggests that the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab leads to durable freedom from progression in some with metastatic urothelial cancer, who have progressed on a CPI alone. Larger studies of chemoimmunotherapy for metastatic urothelial carcinoma are warranted.","Childs, Daniel S; Quevedo, J Fernando; Costello, Brian A; Pagliaro, Lance C",Anti-cancer drugs,https://doi.org/10.1097/cad.0000000000001096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34232950/,12

Empowering patients and their care-partners, including family members or friends involved in their care, may help minimize the burden and consequences of CKD-related symptoms to enable life participation. There is a need to broaden the focus on living well with kidney disease and re-engagement in life, including an emphasis on patients being in control. The World Kidney Day (WKD) Joint Steering Committee has declared 2021 the year of ""Living Well with Kidney Disease"" in an effort to increase education and awareness on the important goal of patient empowerment and life participation. This calls for the development and implementation of validated patient-reported outcome measures to assess and address areas of life participation in routine care. It could be supported by regulatory agencies as a metric for quality care or to support labelling claims for medicines and devices. Funding agencies could establish targeted calls for research that address the priorities of patients. Patients with kidney disease and their care-partners should feel supported to live well through concerted efforts by kidney care communities, including during pandemics. In the overall wellness program for kidney disease patients, the need for prevention should be reiterated. Early detection with a prolonged course of wellness despite kidney disease, after effective secondary and tertiary prevention programs, should be promoted. WKD 2021 continues to call for increased awareness of the importance of preventive measures throughout populations, professionals, and policy makers, applicable to both developed and developing countries.","Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar; Li, Philip Kam-Tao; Tantisattamo, Ekamol; Kumaraswami, Latha; Liakopoulos, Vassilios; Lui, Siu-Fai; Ulasi, Ifeoma; Andreoli, Sharon; Balducci, Alessandro; Dupuis, Sophie; Harris, Tess; Hradsky, Anne; Knight, Richard; Kumar, Sajay; Ng, Maggie; Poidevin, Alice; Saadi, Gamal; Tong, Allison",Kidney diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000516604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34395540/,12

Medicare innovations have been adopted or adapted in Medicaid and by private payers, while Medicare Advantage plans successfully compete with TM only because their payment rates are tied by regulation to those in the traditional Medicare program. However, Medicare has not succeeded in implementing new, value-based payment approaches that also would serve as models for other payers, nor has Medicare succeeded in improving quality by relying on public reporting of measured performance. It is increasingly clear that burdensome attention to measurement and reporting distracts from what could be successful efforts to actually improve care through quality improvement programs, with Medicare leading in partnership with providers, other payers, and patients. Although Congress is unlikely to adopt candidate Biden's proposals to decrease the eligibility age for Medicare or adopt a public option based on Medicare prices and payment methods in the marketplaces, the incoming Biden administration has an opportunity to provide overdue, strategic direction to the pursuit of value-based payments and to replace failed pay-for-performance with provider-managed projects to improve quality and reduce health disparities.","Berenson, Robert","Journal of health politics, policy and law",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-8970838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33493320/,12

METHODOLOGY All COVID-19 patients' clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics, as well as treatment outcome data, were obtained through medical record extraction. Group A had 50 patients (22 men and 28 women) without SPM, and Group B had 20 patients (10 men and 10 women) with SPM. RESULTS Considering the accompanying comorbidities, the frequencies of asthma and inhaler-use was significantly higher in Group B than in Group A (p <0.05). In the CT evaluation at presentation, the rate of involvement of all five lobes of the lung in Group B was significantly higher than in Group A. Rates of tube thoracostomy, mechanical ventilator requirement, length of stay in hospital, and exitus were significantly higher in Group B than in Group A (p <0.05).

Here, we studied the immune cell landscape, with emphasis on MAIT cells, in cohorts totaling 208 patients with various stages of disease. MAIT cell frequency is strongly reduced in blood. They display a strong activated and cytotoxic phenotype that is more pronounced in lungs. Blood MAIT cell alterations positively correlate with the activation of other innate cells, proinflammatory cytokines, notably interleukin (IL)-18, and with the severity and mortality of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. We also identified a monocyte/macrophage interferon (IFN)-α-IL-18 cytokine shift and the ability of infected macrophages to induce the cytotoxicity of MAIT cells in an MR1-dependent manner. Together, our results suggest that altered MAIT cell functions due to IFN-α-IL-18 imbalance contribute to disease severity, and their therapeutic manipulation may prevent deleterious inflammation in COVID-19 aggravation.","Flament, Héloïse; Rouland, Matthieu; Beaudoin, Lucie; Toubal, Amine; Bertrand, Léo; Lebourgeois, Samuel; Rousseau, Camille; Soulard, Pauline; Gouda, Zouriatou; Cagninacci, Lucie; Monteiro, Antoine C; Hurtado-Nedelec, Margarita; Luce, Sandrine; Bailly, Karine; Andrieu, Muriel; Saintpierre, Benjamin; Letourneur, Franck; Jouan, Youenn; Si-Tahar, Mustapha; Baranek, Thomas; Paget, Christophe; Boitard, Christian; Vallet-Pichard, Anaïs; Gautier, Jean-François; Ajzenberg, Nadine; Terrier, Benjamin; Pène, Frédéric; Ghosn, Jade; Lescure, Xavier; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Visseaux, Benoit; Descamps, Diane; Timsit, Jean-François; Monteiro, Renato C; Lehuen, Agnès",Nature immunology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-021-00870-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33531712/,12

The model is fitted to a pediatric SP carriage prevalence data from Atlanta, GA. The model, which is rigorously analysed to investigate the existence and asymptotic stability properties of the associated equilibria (in addition to exploring conditions for competitive exclusion), is simulated to assess the impact of vaccination under different levels of serotype-specific competition and illustrate the phenomenon of serotype replacement.

We used virtual reality as a tool to understand the role of global stereopsis in the visual perception of self-motion and spatial presence using virtual environments experienced through head-mounted displays (HMDs). Participants viewed radially expanding optic flow simulating different speeds of self-motion in depth, which generated the illusion of self-motion in depth (i.e., linear vection). Displays were viewed with the head either stationary (passive radial flow) or laterally swaying to the beat of a metronome (active conditions). Multisensory conflict was imposed in active conditions by presenting displays that either: (i) compensated for head movement (active compensation condition), or (ii) presented pure radial flow with no compensation during head movement (active no compensation condition). In Experiment 1, impairing stereopsis by anisometropic suppression in healthy participants generated declines in reported vection strength, spatial presence and severity of cybersickness. In Experiment 2, vection and presence ratings were compared between participants with and without clinically-defined global stereopsis. Participants without global stereopsis generated impaired vection and presence similarly to those found in Experiment 1 by subjects with induced stereopsis impairment. We find that reducing global stereopsis can have benefits of reducing cybersickness, but has adverse effects on aspects of self-motion perception in HMD VR.","Luu, Wilson; Zangerl, Barbara; Kalloniatis, Michael; Kim, Juno",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-89751-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117273/,12

94169,"Low-density lipoprotein nanomedicines: mechanisms of targeting, biology, and theranostic potential.",2021-12-01,"BACKGROUND Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems exist to reduce death and disability from life-threatening medical emergencies. Less than 9% of the African population is serviced by an emergency medical services transportation system, and nearly two-thirds of African countries do not have any known EMS system in place. One of the leading reasons for EMS utilization in Africa is for obstetric emergencies. The purpose of this systematic review is to provide a qualitative description and summation of previously described interventions to improve access to care for patients with maternal obstetric emergencies in Africa with the intent of identifying interventions that can innovatively be translated to a broader emergency context. METHODS The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) under the number CRD42018105371. We searched the following electronic databases for all abstracts up to 10/19/2020 in accordance to PRISMA guidelines: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus and African Index Medicus. Articles were included if they were focused on a specific mode of transportation or an access-to-care solution for hospital or outpatient clinic care in Africa for maternal or traumatic emergency conditions. Exclusion criteria included in-hospital solutions intended to address a lack of access. Reference and citation analyses were performed, and a data quality assessment was conducted. Data analysis was performed using a qualitative metasynthesis approach. FINDINGS A total of 6,457 references were imported for screening and 1,757 duplicates were removed. Of the 4,700 studies that were screened against title and abstract, 4,485 studies were excluded. Finally, 215 studies were assessed for full-text eligibility and 152 studies were excluded. A final count of 63 studies were included in the systematic review. In the 63 studies that were included, there was representation from 20 countries in Africa. The three most common interventions included specific transportation solutions (n = 39), community engagement (n = 28) and education or training initiatives (n = 27). Over half of the studies included more than one category of intervention. INTERPRETATION Emergency care systems across Africa are understudied and interventions to improve access to care for obstetric emergencies provides important insight into existing solutions for other types of emergency conditions. Physical access to means of transportation, efforts to increase layperson knowledge and recognition of emergent conditions, and community engagement hold the most promise for future efforts at improving emergency access to care.","Joiner, Anjni; Lee, Austin; Chowa, Phindile; Kharel, Ramu; Kumar, Lekshmi; Caruzzo, Nayara Malheiros; Ramirez, Thais; Reynolds, Lindy; Sakita, Francis; Van Vleet, Lee; von Isenburg, Megan; Yaffee, Anna Quay; Staton, Catherine; Vissoci, Joao Ricardo Nickenig",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34086753/,12
94708,Truly emerging--a new disease caused by a novel virus.,2011,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of the MVP™ microvascular plug(Covidien) for closure of vascular anomalies in patients with congenital heart diseases (CHD). BACKGROUND The MVP™ is a novel device with PTFE integrated. The device has been recently introduced in the radiological field and reported exclusively for neurological anomalies. METHODS All CHD patients receiving the device from April 2015 until July 2015 were included in the study and followed up clinically as well as by transthoracic echocardiography. Standard safety and follow-up such as vascular complications, embolization rate, and residual shunting were assessed. RESULTS Twelve patients with a median age of 2.6-years (0.03-12.6 years) and a mean weight of 13 kg (2.8-34.2 kg) were included. Devices were delivered from the femoral artery in 10 and from the femoral vein in 2 patients. Devices were used for closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure (n = 5), aorto-pulmonary collaterals or Blalock-Taussig shunt (n = 5), veno-venous fistula (n = 1), and coronary fistula (n = 1). One device was retrieved before release due to inappropriate size estimation (PDA spasm). The PDA was successfully closed using a PDA device (Lifetech, Medtronic). Immediate angiographic evaluation showed minimal or no shunt in 90% (10/11 patients) and 100% occlusion rate after a mean follow-up of 3.2-months. There was no device embolization, hemolysis, or any other complication following closure. CONCLUSIONS The delivery of new MVP™ micro vascular plug system (Covidien) is safe and effective in patients with CHD for closure of a variety of vascular abnormalities. The low profile of the device and the sheathless nature of the procedure make it particularly interesting for PDA closure in premature babies. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Boudjemline, Younes",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.26622; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27392516/,12

A total of 360 chicken flocks suspected of being infected by IBV were screened for the IBV N gene using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Flocks were classified into four groups according to their IBV vaccination programme. Group 1 contained unvaccinated birds. Group 2 received a single application of live H120 vaccine. Groups 3 and 4 birds received one or two booster vaccination(s), respectively, mostly using the H120 vaccine. The real-time RT-PCR results showed that 51.7% of the flocks were positive for the IBV genome with geographical disparities. Molecular characterization of IBV was performed on 50 RT-PCR positive samples by partially sequencing the S1 gene, including the hypervariable regions (nucleotides 705-1097). Two predominant genotypes were detected, with the Massachusetts type dominating (66%), among which 25% of the samples were identical to the H120 vaccine. The second most common genotype (present in 32% of the flocks) was surprisingly Italy 02, revealing the first detection of this genotype in Morocco and also in Africa. 793B, the predominant genotype in the late 1990s in Morocco, was only detected on one occasion and was identical to the 4/91 vaccine strain.

95741,Consequences of CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated CFTR Knockout in Human Macrophages.,2020,"BACKGROUND Animal models of endotoxemia are frequently used to understand the pathophysiology of sepsis and test new therapies. However, important differences exist between commonly used experimental models of endotoxemia and clinical sepsis. Animal models of endotoxemia frequently produce hypodynamic shock in contrast to clinical hyperdynamic shock. This difference may exaggerate the importance of hypoperfusion as a causative factor in organ dysfunction. This study sought to develop an ovine model of hyperdynamic endotoxemia and assess if there is evidence of impaired oxidative metabolism in the vital organs. METHODS Eight sheep had microdialysis catheters implanted into the brain, heart, liver, kidney, and arterial circulation. Shock was induced with a 4 h escalating dose infusion of endotoxin. After 3 h vasopressor support was initiated with noradrenaline and vasopressin. Animals were monitored for 12 h after endotoxemia. Blood samples were recovered for hemoglobin, white blood cell count, creatinine, and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1Beta, IL-6, and IL-8). RESULTS The endotoxin infusion was successful in producing distributive shock with the mean arterial pressure decreasing from 84.5 ± 12.8 mm Hg to 49 ± 8.03 mm Hg (P < 0.001). Cardiac index remained within the normal range decreasing from 3.33 ± 0.56 L/min/m to 2.89l ± 0.36 L/min/m (P = 0.0845). Lactate/pyruvate ratios were not significantly abnormal in the heart, brain, kidney, or arterial circulation. Liver microdialysis samples demonstrated persistently high lactate/pyruvate ratios (mean 37.9 ± 3.3). CONCLUSIONS An escalating dose endotoxin infusion was successful in producing hyperdynamic shock. There was evidence of impaired oxidative metabolism in the liver suggesting impaired splanchnic perfusion.

97294,"Vaccines for healthcare-associated infections: present, future, and expectations.",2018,"OBJECTIVE Fentanyl sublingual spray offers rapid pain relief in opioid-tolerant cancer patients, and may be useful in acute or post-operative pain. Both opioid-naïve and non-tolerant patients are likely to receive opioids in these settings. Understanding the relationship between systemic exposure of fentanyl sublingual spray and effects on respiratory function in opioid-naïve or non-tolerant populations is important to ensure patient safety. This study evaluated single-dose fentanyl sublingual spray in opioid-naïve participants. RESEARCH DESIGN Participants were randomized to receive single-dose fentanyl sublingual spray (100, 200, 400, 600, 800 mcg) or fentanyl citrate IV in one of five cohorts. Dosing occurred following a 10-h fast, with fasting continuing for 4 h post-dose. Dose proportionality was assessed using analysis of variance and linear regression techniques. PK assessments and safety monitoring were performed through 24 h post-dose. Safety assessments, including adverse event (AE) monitoring, occurred from dosing through Day 7. RESULTS Fifty participants (19-53 years) received fentanyl sublingual spray or fentanyl citrate IV. Mean maximum plasma concentrations were reached between 0.27-0.60 h post-dose for fentanyl sublingual spray. Peak (Cmax) and total (AUC0-t, AUC0-∞) fentanyl exposures increased in a linear, but more than dose-proportional manner, with higher doses. The most common AEs were somnolence, nausea, and vomiting. All AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Doses at 400, 600, and 800 mcg were associated with nausea and vomiting, requiring pharmacologic intervention. Hypoxia episodes requiring nasal cannula oxygenation were observed with 600mcg and 800mcg doses. CONCLUSIONS Overall, single-dose fentanyl sublingual spray (100-800 mcg) was generally well tolerated, with greater incidences of AEs (e.g. nausea, vomiting, hypoxia) at higher doses. Doses up to 200 mcg may be safely administered to healthy opioid-naïve individuals with routine monitoring; doses between 400-800 mcg may be administered in settings with nasal cannula oxygenation.","Rauck, Richard; Oh, D Alexander; Parikh, Neha; Koch, Christian; Singla, Neil; Yu, Jin; Nalamachu, Srinivas; Vetticaden, Santosh",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2017.1352496; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28681626/,12

Most of us become accidental leaders as we never receive training in leadership skills. This not only undermines the effectiveness of PHP but also undermines the credibility of public health as a specialty. Jim Collin's five levels of leadership are useful to understand the various levels of leadership for a PHP. Technical excellence which denotes first level of leadership is necessary but not sufficient to become a leader. One needs team work, emotional competencies, prioritization ( first things first), listening skills, advocacy, negotiation, networking skills, along with conviction, commitment, and courage to do what one thinks is right. Leadership is a life-long journey, not a destination.

97791,Corrigendum.,2016,"OBJECTIVES Only a few studies have applied high-resolution manometry (HRM) to the study of colonic motility in adults and none of them have concurrently evaluated colonic and anal motor activity. The aim of the study was to evaluate colonic and anal motor activity by means of HRM in healthy subjects. As the present study revealed the presence of a new colonic motor pattern (pan-colonic pressurizations) in healthy subjects, three additional studies were conducted: the first and the second to exclude that this motor event results from an artifact due to abdominal wall contraction and to confirm its modulation by cholinergic stimulation, and the third, as pilot study, to test the hypothesis that this colonic pattern is defective in patients with chronic constipation refractory to current pharmacological treatments. METHODS In both volunteers and patients the HRM catheter was advanced proximally during colonoscopy. RESULTS In all subjects, pressure increases of 15±3 mm Hg and 24±4 s simultaneously occurring in all colonic sensors (pan-colonic pressurizations) and associated with anal sphincter relaxation were identified. Subjects had 85±38 pan-colonic pressurizations, which increased significantly during meal (P=0.007) and decreased afterward (P=0.01), and were correlated with feelings of and desire to evacuate gas. The mean number of propagating sequences was 47±39, and only retrograde increased significantly postprandially (P=0.01). Pan-colonic pressurizations differed from strain artifacts and significantly increased after prostigmine. In patients pan-colonic pressurizations were significantly reduced as compared with volunteers. CONCLUSIONS Pan-colonic pressurizations associated with relaxations of the anal sphincter represent a new colonic motor pattern that seems to be defective in patients with treatment-refractory chronic constipation and may have a role in the transport of colonic gas and in the facilitation of the propagating sequence-induced colonic transport.","Corsetti, Maura; Pagliaro, Giuseppe; Demedts, Ingrid; Deloose, Eveline; Gevers, Annemie; Scheerens, Charlotte; Rommel, Nathalie; Tack, Jan",The American journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2016.341; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27596695/,12
97973,Recent advances in liposome formulations for breast cancer therapeutics.,2021-05-11,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common tumors worldwide with high prevalence and lethality. The oncogenic phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway is a classic dysregulated pathway involved in the pathogenesis of HCC. However, the underlying mechanism for how PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway aberrantly activates HCC has not been entirely elucidated. The recognition of the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis sheds light on a new dimension to our understanding of hepatocarcinogenesis. In this review, we comprehensively summarize 67 dysregulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-related lncRNAs in HCC. Many studies have indicated that the 67 dysregulated lncRNAs show oncogenic or anti-oncogenic effects in HCC by regulation on epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and they play pivotal roles in the initiation of HCC in diverse biological processes like proliferation, metastasis, drug resistance, radio-resistance, energy metabolism, autophagy and so on. Besides, many of these lncRNAs are associated with clinicopathological features and clinical prognosis in HCC, which may provide a potential future application in the diagnosis and therapy of HCC.","Wu, Yuting; Zhang, Yingshi; Qin, Xiaochun; Geng, Haobin; Zuo, Daiying; Zhao, Qingchun",Pharmacological research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105195; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916254/,12

The early clinical phase, during viremia, may manifest as pericarditis, acute myocarditis, and sepsis-related cardiomyopathy. Delayed presentations, such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, coronary artery dilation/aneurysms, and late myocarditis, may occur in the weeks after the acute infection. These delayed presentations commonly test negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 via polymerase chain reaction testing and are thought to be primarily postviral hyperinflammatory sequelae. The long-term consequences of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 are unknown. Most recommendations for cardiac management are based on known conditions that are similar. For example, coronary aneurysms can be managed under Kawasaki disease guidelines. Similarly, for patients with COVID-19 myocarditis, they can be cleared for sports under protocols for other types of myocarditis. There is concern for cardiac involvement as a subclinical entity even in more minor presentations. Several expert algorithms have been developed for clearing competition athletes to return to exercise. Sports clearance should be individualized considering the severity of disease, age of patient, and performance level of the sport.

Our study aim was to gather detailed information about services experienced as helpful by those with YOD and family carers. The objective was to identify the core features of these services to inform service design, delivery and improvements. A qualitative approach based on appreciative inquiry was used, posing open-ended questions about services experienced as helpful, as part of a national UK survey of people with YOD and carers. We used inductive thematic analysis to analyse the free-text responses. The resulting template was used as a basis for analysis of in-depth follow-up interviews, conducted to acquire greater in-depth understanding. Two hundred and thirty-three survey respondents provided 856 examples of helpful support. Twenty-four follow-up interviews were conducted (two with dyads, so 26 participants in total: 8 with people with YOD, 14 with carers, 2 with dyads). Twelve themes capturing the features of helpful services were clustered into three super-ordinate themes. 'Person-centredness' reflects micro levels of person-professional interaction (positive attitude, flexibility, collaborative, user-friendly materials, and in-person). 'Functional consistency' captures the meso level, demonstrating that services were helpful when organised consistently with needs (age-appropriate, holistic, responsive, and accessible). 'Organisational coherence', at the macro level, emphasises the need for service integration, specialist services and service continuity. Key conclusions are that the needs for flexibility and a collaborative stance may be particularly important for those under 65 years with dementia, who have full lives and are used to being in control; to be age-appropriate, helpful services need to provide activities and opportunities suitable for active middle-aged people; and to be holistic, services need to provide for needs associated with rare dementias and be family-centred. Specialist services need to be commissioned and arrangements need to be stable over time to enable continuity.","Stamou, Vasileios; La Fontaine, Jenny; O'Malley, Mary; Jones, Bridget; Parkes, Jacqueline; Carter, Janet; Oyebode, Jan R",Health & social care in the community,https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33951252/,12

HCoV-NL63, which was first isolated from a seven-month-old child in 2004, has led to infections worldwide and accounts for 10% of all respiratory illnesses caused by etiological agents. However, effective antivirals against HCoV-NL63 infection are currently unavailable. The HCoV-NL63 main protease (Mpro), also called 3C-like protease (3CLpro), plays a vital role in mediating viral replication and transcription by catalyzing the cleavage of replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) into functional subunits. Moreover, Mpro is highly conserved among all coronaviruses, thus making it a prominent drug target for antiviral therapy. Here, four crystal structures of HCoV-NL63 Mpro in the apo form at different pH values are reported at resolutions of up to 1.78 Å. Comparison with Mpro from other human betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV reveals common and distinct structural features in different genera and extends knowledge of the diversity, function and evolution of coronaviruses.","Gao, Hongxia; Zhang, Yuting; Jiang, Haihai; Hu, Xiaohui; Zhou, Xuelan; Zhong, Fanglin; Lin, Cheng; Li, Jian; Luo, Jun; Zhang, Jin","Acta crystallographica.

In general terms, the geochemical composition of the clastic sediments was consistent with the geochemistry inferred from the mineralogical study. However, sediments with a smaller grain size showed higher concentrations than the bigger grain size counterparts for elements such as Fe, S, Cu and As. This behavior was particularly evident in the Yerba Loca basin and it was attributed to the seasonal appearance of Fe- and Al-rich precipitates as constituents of the finer sediments. Different methodologies for the calculation of geochemical backgrounds (Tukey's inner fence, TIF; Median + 2*Median Absolute Deviation, MAD; and 95th percentile) were tested. Results suggest that the 95th percentile-method was the most appropriate for this type of mountainous systems. Using the selected methodology, three different geochemical backgrounds were calculated: 1) Yerba Loca basin, 2) Molina basin, and 3) Mapocho Upper basin. When the generated background levels were compared with the Consensus-Based (CB) Sediment Quality Guidelines; Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb, Cu, Cr, Ni and As showed background values that were consistently higher than the values set by the CB Threshold Effect Concentration and, even higher than the CB Probable Effect Concentration for Fe (MUBBackground: 6.78 wt% vs CB PEC: 4.00 wt%; and Cu (MUBBacground: 3387 mg kg-1 vs CB PEC: 149 mg kg-1). The present study clearly states the paramount importance of having a solid geochemical background before any attempt of a sediment risk assessment is made at HMHA regions.","Correa-Burrows, José P; Navarrete-Calvo, Álvaro; Valenzuela-Díaz, Martín J; Zapata-Aguiló, Valeria A; Montserrat, Santiago; Navarro-Valdivia, Leonardo; McPhee, James; Caraballo, Manuel A",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932681/,12

METHODS All prerandomization and follow-up (24-48 hours) CT brain scans in IST-3 were assessed for HAS presence, location, and extent by masked raters. We assessed whether HAS grew, persisted, shrank, or disappeared at follow-up, the association with 6-month functional outcome, and effect of alteplase. IST-3 is registered (ISRCTN25765518). RESULTS HAS presence (vs absence) independently predicted poor 6-month outcome (increased Oxford Handicap Scale [OHS]) on adjusted ordinal regression analysis (odds ratio [OR] 0.66, p < 0.001). Outcome was worse in patients with more (vs less) extensive HAS (OR 0.61, p = 0.027) but not in proximal (vs distal) HAS (p = 0.420). Increasing age was associated with more HAS growth at follow-up (OR 1.01, p = 0.013). Treatment with alteplase increased HAS shrinkage/disappearance at follow-up (OR 0.77, p = 0.006). There was no significant difference in HAS shrinkage with alteplase in proximal (vs distal) or more (vs less) extensive HAS (p = 0.516 and p = 0.580, respectively). There was no interaction between presence vs absence of HAS and benefit of alteplase on 6-month OHS (p = 0.167). CONCLUSIONS IV alteplase promotes measurable reduction in HAS regardless of HAS location or extent. Alteplase increased independence at 6 months in patients with and without HAS.

The objective of the study is to compare the two approaches (extraoral and intraoral) of GNB in patients of carcinoma of the tongue in terms of efficacy, duration, and complications. Materials and Methods This was a prospective comparative randomized study over a period of 1 year. Fifty patients of either sex of ASA physical status and 2, between 21 and 70 years of age, suffering from carcinoma of the tongue, were selected. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group I received 4 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine combined with 40 mg, of triamcinolonacetonide by extraoral approach of GNB, and Group II received the same amount of drug by intraoral approach of GNB. Hemodynamic parameters, degree of pain relief using visual analog scale (VAS), number of attempts, effect on quality of life (QOL), and complication were noted during the performance of GNB. Results Demographic profile in both groups was comparable. Rate of complication and number of attempts to complete intervention were higher in Group I, which was found to be statistically significant. However, mean VAS scores in Group I were significantly higher as compared to those in Group II during most of the study period starting from the 1st follow-up at 30 min to the 2nd month postintervention (P < 0.05).

METHODS Patients undergoing secondary bariatric surgery between 2009 and 2017 were retrospectively identified from a prospective database. Primary outcomes were weight loss and improvement in comorbidities. For weight loss, percent of total body weight loss (%TWL) and percentage of excess BMI loss (%EBMIL) were included. Comorbidities included were hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), cardiovascular risk (CV) and hypertension. RESULTS 266 Secondary bariatric procedures were analyzed. There were four Grade IIIb complications within 30 days. There was greater %EBMIL at 12 and 24 months in the AGB to RYGB group, and in %TWL at 24 months compared to AGB to SG group (p < 0.05). Only AGB to RYGB had significantly continued improvement in these two parameters at 24 months compared to at 6 months post-operatively-%EBMIL and %TWL tapered off in the other procedures. There was significantly lower CV risk in dyslipidemic patients at 24 months in the AGB to RYGB compared to the AGB to SG group. In the SG to RYGB patients, there was significant improvement in CV risk in dyslipidemic patients at 24 months compared to baseline. There was significant improvement in HbA1C in diabetics in AGB to RYGB patients at 6 and 12 months, in AGB to SG patients at 12 months, and in SG to RYGB patients at 12 and 24 months compared to baseline. In RYGB revision and SG to RYGB patients, there was a relative increase in the number of patients being normotensive at 24 months compared to baseline.

The cecal appendix may influence the homeostasis of the colonic microbiota. In this large population-based study, we investigated whether early removal of the appendix is associated with an increased risk of mental disorders later in life. MATERIALS AND METHODS All Swedish individuals born between 1973 and 1992 (N = 1,937,488) were included and followed prospectively until December 31, 2016 for any psychiatric International Classification of Disease diagnosis from age 14 or later in life. The main exposure was defined as having a history of appendectomy before age 14 (N = 44,259); the second exposure, appendicitis before age 14 but without appendectomy (N = 1,542), and the third exposure studied was a history of hernia surgery before age 14 (N = 35,523). Control groups for each respective exposure were all unexposed individuals in the study population. RESULTS Individuals exposed to appendectomy before age 14 had a 19% increased risk of depressive disorder (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.19; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.15-1.23), 27% increased risk of bipolar affective disorder (aHR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.17-1.37), and a 20% increased risk of an anxiety disorder (aHR = 1.20; 95% CI: 1.16-1.23) compared to individuals unexposed to childhood appendectomy. We found no association between appendectomy and increased risk of obsessive-compulsive disorder and schizophrenia and there was no association between appendicitis without appendectomy and mental disorders. The association between childhood hernia surgery and mental disorders later in life was small but significant. CONCLUSION Childhood appendectomy, but not appendicitis without appendectomy, was associated with a significantly increased risk of mood and anxiety disorders in adulthood.","Ekström, Lucas D; Ekström, Hampus; Dal, Henrik; Kosidou, Kyriaki; Gustafsson, Ulf O",Depression and anxiety,https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668089/,12

The pandemic influenza A H1N1 2009 virus (A/2009/H1N1) finally arrived, causing the first pandemic influenza of the new millennium, which has affected over 214 countries and caused over 18,449 deaths. Because of the persistent threat from the A/H5N1 virus since 1997 and the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, medical and scientific communities have been more prepared in mindset and infrastructure. This preparedness has allowed for rapid and effective research on the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, immunological, virological, and other basic scientific aspects of the disease, with impacts on its control. A PubMed search using the keywords ""pandemic influenza virus H1N1 2009"" yielded over 2,500 publications, which markedly exceeded the number published on previous pandemics. Only representative works with relevance to clinical microbiology and infectious diseases are reviewed in this article. A significant increase in the understanding of this virus and the disease within such a short amount of time has allowed for the timely development of diagnostic tests, treatments, and preventive measures. These findings could prove useful for future randomized controlled clinical trials and the epidemiological control of future pandemics.","Cheng, Vincent C C; To, Kelvin K W; Tse, Herman; Hung, Ivan F N; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.05012-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22491771/,12

VP8 subunit of rotavirus is the major determinant of the viral infectivity and neutralization. Spike glycoprotein of coronavirus is responsible for induction of neutralizing antibody response. Studies showed that immunoglobulin of egg yolk (IgY) from immunized hens has been identified to be a convenient source for specific antibodies for using in immunotherapy and immunodiagnostic to limit the infections. In this study, chimeric VP8-S2 gene was designed using by computational techniques. The chimeric VP8-S2 gene was cloned and sub-cloned into pGH and pET32a (+) vectors. Then, recombinant pET32a-VP8-S2 vector was transferred into E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3). The expressed protein was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography column. Hens were immunized with the purified VP8-S2 protein three times. IgY was purified from egg yolks using polyethylene glycol precipitation method. Activity and specificity of anti-VP8-S2 IgY were detected by dot-blotting, Western-blotting and indirect ELISA. We obtained anti-VP8-S2 IgY by immunizing hens with the recombinant VP8-S2 protein. The anti-VP8-S2 IgY was showed to bind specifically to the chimeric VP8-S2 protein by dot-blotting, Western-blotting analyses and indirect ELISA. The result of this study indicated that such construction can be useful to investigate as candidates for development of detection methods for simultaneous diagnosis of both infections.

OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate current studies and present an evidence-based assessment of the outcomes for the techniques available for SC. DATA SOURCES A literature search of the PubMed/MEDLINE (1954 to November 2013) and EMBASE (1974 to November 2013) databases was conducted. Search criteria included the words subtotal, partial, insufficient or incomplete, and cholecystectomy. STUDY SELECTION Inclusion criteria were all randomized, nonrandomized, and retrospective studies with data on SC techniques and outcomes. Exclusion criteria were studies that reported data on SC along with other interventions (eg, cholecystostomy) without the possibility to discriminate results specific to SC. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS This systematic review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome of the study was the occurrence of common bild duct injury. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of other SC-related morbidities, such as hemorrhage, subhepatic collection, bile leak, retained stones, postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, wound infection, reoperation, and mortality. RESULTS Thirty articles were included. Subtotal cholecystectomy was typically performed using the laparoscopic technique (72.9%), followed by the open (19.0%) and laparoscopic converted to open (8.0%) techniques. The most common indications were severe cholecystitis (72.1%), followed by cholelithiasis in liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension (18.2%) and empyema or perforated gallbladder (6.1%). Morbidity rates were relatively low (postoperative hemorrhage, 0.3%; subhepatic collections, 2.9%; bile duct injury, 0.08%; and retained stones, 3.1%); the rate for bile leaks was higher (18.0%). Reoperations were necessary in 1.8% of the cases; the 30-day mortality rate was 0.4%. The laparoscopic approach produced less risk of subhepatic collection (odds ratio [OR], 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9), retained stones (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9), wound infection (OR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.04-0.2), reoperation (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9), and mortality (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.05-0.9) but more bile leaks (OR, 5.3; 95% CI, 3.9-7.2) compared with the open approach. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Subtotal cholecystectomy is an important tool for use in difficult gallbladders and achieves morbidity rates comparable to those reported for total cholecystectomy in simple cases. The various technical differences appear to influence outcomes only for the laparoscopic approach.","Elshaer, Mohamed; Gravante, Gianpiero; Thomas, Katie; Sorge, Roberto; Al-Hamali, Salem; Ebdewi, Hamdi",JAMA surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamasurg.2014.1219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25548894/,12
103412,Middle cerebral artery aneurysm endovascular and surgical therapies: comprehensive literature review and local experience.,2014,"PURPOSE To assess suspected acute stroke, the computed tomography (CT) protocol contains a non-contrast CT (NCCT), a CT angiography (CTA), and a CT perfusion (CTP). Due to assumably high radiation doses of the complete protocol, the aim of this study is to examine radiation exposure and to establish diagnostic reference levels (DRLs). METHODS In this retrospective study, dose data of 921 patients with initial CT imaging for suspected acute stroke and dose monitoring with a DICOM header-based tracking and monitoring software were analyzed. Between June 2017 and January 2020, 1655 CT scans were included, which were performed on three different modern multi-slice CT scanners, including 921 NCCT, 465 CTA, and 269 CTP scans. Radiation exposure was reported for CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose-length product (DLP). DRLs were set at the 75th percentile of dose distribution. RESULTS DRLs were assessed for each step (CTDIvol/DLP): NCCT 33.9 mGy/527.8 mGy cm and CTA 13.7 mGy/478.3 mGy cm. Radiation exposure of CTP was invariable and depended on CT device and its protocol settings with CTDIvol 124.9-258.2 mGy and DLP 1852.6-3044.3 mGy cm. CONCLUSION Performing complementary CT techniques such as CTA and CTP for the assessment of acute stroke increases total radiation exposure. Hence, the revised DRLs for the complete protocol are required, where our local DRLs may help as benchmarks.","Zensen, Sebastian; Guberina, Nika; Opitz, Marcel; Köhrmann, Martin; Deuschl, Cornelius; Forsting, Michael; Wetter, Axel; Bos, Denise",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-020-02548-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901338/,12

IL-27 functions through IL-27R and has been shown to have potent antitumor activity via activation of a variety of cellular components, including antitumor CD8(+) T-cell responses. However, the exact mechanisms of how IL-27 enhances antitumor CD8(+) T-cell responses remain unclear. Here we show that IL-27 significantly enhances the survival of activated tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in vitro and in vivo, and programs tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells into memory precursor-like effector cells, characterized by upregulation of Bcl-6, SOCS3, Sca-1, and IL-10. While STAT3 activation and the CTL survival-enhancing effects can be independent of CTL IL-10 production, we show here that IL-27-induced CTL IL-10 production contributes to memory precursor cell phenotype induction, CTL memory, and tumor rejection. Thus, IL-27 enhances antitumor CTL responses via programming tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells into a unique memory precursor type of effector cells characterized by a greater survival advantage. Our results have important implications for designing immunotherapy against human cancer.","Liu, Zhenzhen; Liu, Jin-Qing; Talebian, Fatemeh; Wu, Lai-Chu; Li, Shulin; Bai, Xue-Feng",European journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.201242930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23225163/,12

The present report describes long-term follow-up at 5 years. METHODS The 5-year follow-up of this multicentre European study included assessment of the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), and GSV occlusion and reflux on duplex imaging. RESULTS A total of 225 patients had 295 GSVs treated by RFA, achieving an initial vein occlusion rate of 100 per cent. With 80·0 per cent compliance, Kaplan-Meier analyses showed a GSV occlusion rate of 91·9 per cent and a reflux-free rate of 94·9 per cent at 5 years. Among the 15 GSVs noted with reflux during follow-up, only three showed full recanalization of the GSV at 1 week, 6 months and 3 years. Of the 12 legs with partial recanalization, reflux originated at the saphenofemoral junction in ten, with a mean length of the patent segment of 5·8 (range 3·2-10) cm; only six patients were symptomatic.

Health workers (HWs) are major players in the fight against this infection and are occupationally exposed to the virus in the course of their work. In this context, this study presents surveillance data on 1714 workers in a hospital center in the south of France for the period from March 17 to April 20, 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS Symptomatic HWs, contact cases and those with high anxiety were tested. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was performed by RT-PCR after nasopharyngeal sampling. RESULTS During this period, 30.4% of hospital staff received 3028 nasal swabs. Of these, 8.0% were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Among the SARS-CoV-2 positive HWs, 24.3% were asymptomatic. Among COVID unit and non COVID unit, the positive HWs for SARS-CoV-2 were, respectively, 5.8% and 8.2% (p = 0.2). HWs over 50 years of age were less likely to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 (3.8%) than other younger HWs (9.1%) (p < 0.001). No serious cases of COVID-19 were reported in our population during this period. DISCUSSION Our study suggests that HWs who tested positive for COVID-19 are often asymptomatic. Therefore, PPE is pivotal to prevent HWs to patients and HWs to HWs transmission during workshifts. Contact tracing and screening is essential to limit the spread of the virus within the hospital. On the other hand, HWs working in COVID-19 units are not more often infected probably because they have a higher risk awareness than other HWs.","Noel, Ludovic; Marion, Elise; Boufercha, Rafika; Martin, Françoise; Zandotti, Christine; Charrel, Remi; Bouhadfane, Mouloud; Lehucher-Michel, Marie Pascale; Villa, Antoine",International archives of occupational and environmental health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-021-01789-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34654945/,12

This is the first study to report on SctO2 in a wide range of patients undergoing lengthy TP and robotic surgery. We measured SctO2 during robotic surgery in patients in the TP with C-INSF, as well as a control robotic thyroid surgery group who were supine with no C-INSF. We recorded relevant variables and periods of cerebral desaturation (CD). We studied 42 patients in 25°-45° of TP for ≥125 min. Management was at the providers' discretion. The INVOS(®) 5100C Cerebral Oximeter (Covidien, Boulder, CO) recorded SctO2. CD was defined as a >20 % decrease from baseline SctO2 or a value ≤55 % for ≥10 min. Patients were assessed for adverse outcome. The sample consisted of 13 males and 29 females aged 22-73, BMI 22-36 had general (N = 3), urological (N = 14) and gynecological (N = 25) surgery; two patients had CD lasting 150 and 190 min and two had episodic CD lasting 10-35 min. The four were female aged 22-60 in 38°-45° of TP. Eleven cases had multiple episodic CD for ≤15 min, 27 TP cases had no CD. Other observations included a consistent fall in SctO2 with phenylephrine; an increased SctO2 with ephedrine; and FiO2 and EtCO2 being generally strong, direct modifiers of SctO2. High MAP was inconsistently associated with high SctO2. BMI had no observed effect on SctO2. Pulse oximetry was ≥97 % in all cases. We observed no adverse cerebral events on follow-up.

105167,Targeting Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC).,2021-01-29,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) is a pivotal component of the renin-angiotensin system, promoting the conversion of angiotensin II (Ang-II) to Ang-(1-7). We previously reported that decreased ACE2 expression and activity contributes to the development of Ang-II-mediated hypertension in mice. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms involved in ACE2 downregulation during neurogenic hypertension. In ACE2-transfected Neuro-2A cells, Ang-II treatment resulted in a significant attenuation of ACE2 enzymatic activity. Examination of the subcellular localization of ACE2 revealed that Ang-II treatment leads to ACE2 internalization and degradation into lysosomes. These effects were prevented by both the Ang-II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker losartan and the lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin. In contrast, in HEK293T cells, which lack endogenous AT1R, Ang-II failed to promote ACE2 internalization. Moreover, this effect could be induced after AT1R transfection. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that AT1R and ACE2 form complexes, and these interactions were decreased by Ang-II treatment, which also enhanced ACE2 ubiquitination. In contrast, ACE2 activity was not changed by transfection of AT2 or Mas receptors. In vivo, Ang-II-mediated hypertension was blunted by chronic infusion of leupeptin in wildtype C57Bl/6, but not in ACE2 knockout mice. Overall, this is the first demonstration that elevated Ang-II levels reduce ACE2 expression and activity by stimulation of lysosomal degradation through an AT1R-dependent mechanism.","Deshotels, Matthew R; Xia, Huijing; Sriramula, Srinivas; Lazartigues, Eric; Filipeanu, Catalin M",Hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.114.03743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25225202/,12
105405,Perivascular stromal cells: Directors of tissue immune niches.,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND The staple line leakage is a dangerous complication of sleeve gastrectomy. Various strategies have been tried to reduce the leakage risk. The amniotic membrane (AmM) is the inner layer of the placental membranes and has anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrosis, and anti-scarring effects, and it also has lower immune characteristics which are another essential characteristic of AmM concerning its utility for grafting. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of AmM on the staple line healing process of sleeve gastrectomy model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS We used twenty-eight Long-Evans rats in this study. Sleeve gastrectomy was performed with tristapler. Fourteen rats served as controls, AmM was applied staple line of the other fourteen. Fourteen animals were sacrificed (seven from the AmM applied group and the other seven from the control group) on the third postoperative day. And, the other fourteen animals were sacrificed (seven from the AmM applied group and seven from the control group) on the seventh postoperative day. The tissue around the staple line was evaluated microscopically and macroscopically, bursting pressures and hydroxyproline levels were also measured. RESULTS The bursting pressure and hydroxyproline measurements of the AmM applied group was significantly higher on the seventh postoperative day (p = 0.015, p = 0.012) Fibroblast activity and neoangiogenesis of the AmM applied group was also significantly higher on the seventh postoperative day (p = 0.004, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION This study showed that covering of staple line of sleeve gastrectomy model in rats significantly provided higher bursting pressures and increased hydroxyproline levels, fibroblast activity, and neoangiogenesis which may potentially lead a better staple line healing. We think further investigations are needed on this issue.","Ferhatoglu, Murat Ferhat; Kıvılcım, Taner; Senol, Kazım; Vural, Gurcan; Kartal, Abdulcabbar; İncir, Said; Filiz, Ali İlker; Kebudi, Abut",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-019-04027-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187460/,12
106301,In vivo evaluation of a novel format of a bivalent HER3-targeting and albumin-binding therapeutic affibody construct.,2017,"BACKGROUND During nephron induction, morphogenetic molecules are reciprocally exchanged between epithelial and mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells within the renal stem/progenitor cell niche. That these molecules remain concentrated, it is assumed that both cell populations stand in close contact to each other. However, recently published data illustrate that epithelial and mesenchymal cells are separated by an astonishingly wide interstitial interface. METHODS To gain deeper morphological insights into the spatial distribution of mesenchymal and epithelial stem/progenitor cells, the embryonic zone of neonatal rabbit kidney was fixed either with glutaraldehyde (GA) or in a combination with cupromeronic blue, ruthenium red or tannic acid. Transmission electron microscopy was then performed on exactly orientated sections. RESULTS Conventional fixation with GA illustrates that epithelial and mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells are separated by a bright but inconspicuously looking interstitial interface. In contrast, fixation of specimens in GA containing cupromeronic blue, ruthenium red or tannic acid elucidates that part of the interstitial interface exhibits a special extracellular matrix extending like woven strands between mesenchymal and epithelial stem/progenitor cells. In parallel, filigree projections from mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells cross the interstitial interface to penetrate the basal lamina of epithelial cells. Fusion of the plasma membranes cannot be observed. Instead, touching mesenchymal cell projections form a cone at the contact site with tunneling nanotubes.

106654,Unconventional role of lysosomes in phagocytosis.,2020-08-17,"Objective. To conduct a scoping review of the existing literature to identify published studies on innovative teaching and assessment practices for antimicrobial stewardship in the Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum and to provide a foundation for future scholarly research in this important area.Findings. Seven studies were found that met the inclusion criteria. Two of the studies explored the extent, content, and methods of delivery of antimicrobial stewardship, four studies described elective courses in antimicrobial stewardship, and one study described an interprofessional module. Most studies were conducted in the United States. Several pharmacy schools in the UK and the US incorporated antimicrobial stewardship teaching into their curriculum. Learning objectives for the elective courses focused on guidelines issued by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), antimicrobial stewardship literature appraisal and principal application. The most used teaching strategy was didactic lectures, followed by case studies. Active-learning approaches like simulators, problem-based learning, and presentations were also used but to a lesser extent.Summary. Antimicrobial stewardship curricular reform may be influenced by the timing of the course, teaching approaches, and performance assessment of students. Antimicrobial stewardship learning should be a required of all pharmacy students. The scarcity of scholarly activity in the teaching of and assessment of learning in antimicrobial stewardship suggests that curricular planning should be guided by national or international organizations to ensure pharmacy students learn such important material.","Nasr, Ziad G; Abbara, Duha M; Wilby, Kyle J",American journal of pharmaceutical education,https://doi.org/10.5688/ajpe8415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34315706/,12

107056,Erratum.,2021,"PURPOSE We previously reported the safety and efficacy in animal experiments of transcutaneous immunization (TCI) using a self-dissolving microneedle patch (MicroHyala; MH) made of hyaluronic acid and collagen. However, this MH was an unsuitable TCI device for the human skin, as collagen is suspected to induce inflammation. In this study, we developed an improved collagen-free MH (new-MH) and conducted clinical study to evaluate the fundamental properties and safety in human. METHODS Microneedle dissolution, skin irritation, and antigen-specific antibody production about new-MH were measured in mice and/or rats. On the basis of the results, the clinical study was conducted in healthy volunteers to evaluate local and systemic adverse events caused by new-MH application. RESULTS We confirmed that the microneedles of new-MH, as well as those on our old-MH that contained collagen, could easily pierce stratum corneum without severe skin irritation, and that TCI using new-MH efficiently increased antibody titer with comparable to TCI using old-MH. Application of new-MH caused no severe adverse reactions in 20 healthy volunteers enrolled in a clinical study. CONCLUSIONS These results verified that new-MH is a safe TCI device in human, and greatly encouraged us to advance PI/PII clinical studies of antigen-loaded new-MH.","Hirobe, Sachiko; Azukizawa, Hiroaki; Matsuo, Kazuhiko; Zhai, You; Quan, Ying-Shu; Kamiyama, Fumio; Suzuki, Hiroshi; Katayama, Ichiro; Okada, Naoki; Nakagawa, Shinsaku",Pharmaceutical research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-013-1092-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23775442/,12

The absence of a standardized definition for PE-related death hampers study outcome evaluation and between-study comparisons. OBJECTIVES To summarize definitions for PE-related death used in recent VTE studies and to assess the PE-related death rate. PATIENTS/METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted on April 26th , 2018 from January 1st , 2014 up to the search date in MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL. Cohort studies and randomized trials in which PE-related death was included in the primary outcome were eligible. Screening of titles, abstracts, and full-text articles, and data extraction were independently performed in duplicate by two authors. Study outcomes included the definition for PE-related death, VTE case-fatality rate, and death due to PE rate. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. RESULTS Of the 6,807 identified citations, 83 studies were included of which 27% were randomized trials, 31% were prospective and 42% retrospective cohort studies. Thirty-five studies (42%) had a central adjudication committee. Thirty-eight (46%) reported a definition for PE-related death of which the most frequently used components were 'autopsy-confirmed PE' (50%), 'objectively confirmed PE before death' (55%), and 'unexplained death' (58%). Median VTE case-fatality rate was 1.8% (interquartile range, 0.0 to 13). CONCLUSIONS Only half of the included studies reported definitions for PE-related death, which were very heterogeneous. Case-fatality rate of VTE events varied widely across studies. Standardization of the definition and guidance on adjudication and reporting of PE-related death is needed.

It plays an important role in physiological and pathological processes in the human body and its level may be clinically relevant in new onset atrial fibrillation. The aim of this study was to determine whether elevated MR-proANP level is a predictor of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with acute myocardial infarction.Methods and results: The study included 96 patients with their first diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction hospitalized in the Department of Interventional Cardiology within one year. The plasma levels of MR-proANP were determined on admission, and on the first and fifth day of hospitalization by BRAHMS MRproANP KRYPTOR. New onset AF was diagnosed in 9.4% of patients during hospitalization; the level of MR proANP was also found to be significantly higher in this group of patients compared to those without arrhythmia (p = 0.017). ROC curve analysis indicates that the concentration of MR-proANP is a good predictor of AF diagnosed during the hospitalization in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AUC =0.738, p = 0.0011).Conclusions: MR-proANP might be a good predictor of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with acute myocardial infarction.","Idzikowska, Karolina; Kacprzak, Michał; Zielińska, Marzenna","Biomarkers : biochemical indicators of exposure, response, and susceptibility to chemicals",https://doi.org/10.1080/1354750x.2020.1814414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32972251/,12

GOAL The aim of this study was to assess the management practices and experience of coeliac disease patients with their follow-up appointments in Central Europe. STUDY Gastroenterologists and coeliac disease patients in five Central European countries were asked to complete the web-based questionnaire focusing on coeliac disease management practices. RESULTS Answers from 147 gastroenterologists and 2041 coeliac disease patients were available for the analysis. More than half of the gastroenterologists (58.5%) schedule the first follow-up visit within 3 months after the diagnosis. At follow-up, tissue transglutaminase antibodies are checked in almost all patients (95.9%). Approximately two-thirds (60.7%) of gastroenterologists refer all of their patients to the dietitian at diagnosis. Similarly, 42.8% of coeliac disease patients reported that they had not been appointed to a dietitian. Almost one-third of coeliac disease patients (30.8%) reported that they had no follow-up appointments with gastroenterologist at all.

Understand the anatomy of the cranium. Understand the importance of the preoperative workup in the cranial reconstruction decision-making process. Describe the options available for calvarial reconstruction including autologous and alloplastic materials. Describe the basic differences between available alloplastic materials. Understand the intraoperative and postoperative complications that may arise during cranioplasty. SUMMARY Cranial defects can arise from a variety of causes, yielding a diverse group of patients who require cranioplasty. The goals of calvarial reconstruction are to protect the underlying brain, to restore the aesthetic contour of the calvarium, and/or to treat postcraniectomy cerebrospinal fluid circulation abnormalities that may be symptomatic. Options for calvarial reconstruction include the autogenous bone flap that was removed for access, autologous bone grafting, and a variety of alloplastic materials such as titanium, hydroxyapatite, polymethylmethacrylate, polyether ether ketone, and high-density porous polyethylene. A detailed preoperative workup and discussion with the patient is important to choosing the appropriate reconstructive path.","Pasick, Christina Marie; Margetis, Konstantinos; Santiago, Gabriel F; Gordon, Chad; Taub, Peter J",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0000000000005659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31478955/,12

METHODS Between January 2007 and January 2011, 28 consecutive patients (85.7% male, mean age 67.1 ± 9.1 years) with LAF underwent video-assisted bilateral RF ablation. Fourteen patients (50%) had paroxysmal, five (17.8%) persistent, and nine (32.2%) long-persistent LAF. All patients were followed-up according to the Heart Rhythm Society/ European Heart Rhythm Association/European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society (HRS/EHRA/ECA) and success/failure was reported as suggested by Society of Thoracic Surgeon (STS) guidelines. Mean follow-up was 27.8 ± 8.6 months. RESULTS Time-related prevalence of postoperative AF was 4.5% at 36 months. Success was much more likely in subjects with paroxysmal (3-year prevalence, 0%) or persistent (3-year prevalence, 0%) than long-standing persistent LAF (3-year prevalence, 8.3%). At 36 months the estimated prevalence of antiarrhythmic drugs was 11.3% (8.8 to 13.7). No major thromboembolic events were detected during the follow-up period and 36-month prevalence of Warfarin use was 15.2% (11.5 to 18.1). Finally, no patient underwent electrical cardioversion.

METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted from inception to December 2017 using MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL. Studies were included if they specifically concerned older people (≥65 years) with limited life expectancy, including those residing in any type of aged care facility, or were based on representative patient profiles. Results were analyzed inspired by the Joanna Briggs Institute's method for synthesis of qualitative data. Studies were characterized using a checklist for reporting of qualitative research. RESULTS Eight studies were included. Six studies explored health care professionals' views on deprescribing in general, and two studies focused specifically on psychotropic agents. All eight studies explored the views of physicians, mostly general practitioners, while three studies also considered other health care professionals. Four themes related to health care professionals' attitudes towards deprescribing were identified: (i) patient and relative involvement; (ii) the importance of teamwork; (iii) health care professionals' self-assurance and skills; and (iv) the impact of organizational factors. Within each of these themes, 3-4 subthemes were identified and analysed. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that health care professionals' decisions to engage in deprescribing activities with older people with limited life expectancy depend on multiple factors which are highly interdependent. Consequently, there is an urgent need for more research on how to approach deprescribing in clinical practice within this population.","Lundby, Carina; Graabaek, Trine; Ryg, Jesper; Søndergaard, Jens; Pottegård, Anton; Nielsen, Dorthe Susanne",British journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.13861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30630219/,12

The effect of the pandemic on emergency general surgery patients remains unknown. OBJECTIVE To reveal the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality and morbidity among emergency general surgery cases. DESIGN AND SETTING Data on patients who were admitted to the emergency department of a tertiary hospital in Samsun, Turkey, and had consultations at the general surgery clinic were analyzed retrospectively. METHODS Our study included comparative analysis on two groups of patients who received emergency general surgery consultations in our hospital: during the COVID-19 pandemic period (Group 2); and on the same dates one year previously (Group 1). RESULTS There were 195 patients in Group 1 and 132 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). While 113 (58%) of the patients in Group 1 were women, only 58 (44%) were women in Group 2 (P = 0.013). Considering all types of diagnosis, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.261). The rates of abscess and delayed abdominal emergency diseases were higher in Group 2: one case (0.5%) versus ten cases (8%); P < 0.001. The morbidity rate was higher in Group 2 than in Group 1: three cases (1.5%) versus nine cases (7%); P = 0.016.

Stereotactic, magnetic resonance (MR)-guided online-adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) may improve SBRT's therapeutic ratio. This prospective Phase I trial assessed feasibility and potential advantages of SMART to treat abdominal malignancies. MATERIALS/METHODS Twenty patients with oligometastatic or unresectable primary liver (n = 10) and non-liver (n = 10) abdominal malignancies underwent SMART. Initial plans prescribed 50 Gy/5 fractions (BED 100 Gy) with goal 95% PTV coverage by 95% of prescription, subject to hard OAR constraints. Daily real-time online-adaptive plans were created as needed, based on daily setup MR-image-set tumor/OAR ""anatomy-of-the-day"" to preserve hard OAR constraints, escalate PTV dose, or both. Treatment times, patient outcomes, and dosimetric comparisons between initial and adaptive plans were prospectively recorded. RESULTS Online adaptive plans were created at time of treatment for 81/97 fractions, due to initial plan violation of OAR constraints (61/97) or observed opportunity for PTV dose escalation (20/97). Plan adaptation increased PTV coverage in 64/97 fractions. Zero Grade ≥ 3 acute (<6 months) treatment-related toxicities were observed. DISCUSSION SMART is clinically deliverable and safe, allowing PTV dose escalation and/or simultaneous OAR sparing compared to non-adaptive abdominal SBRT.","Henke, Lauren; Kashani, Rojano; Robinson, Clifford; Curcuru, Austen; DeWees, Todd; Bradley, Jeffrey; Green, Olga; Michalski, Jeff; Mutic, Sasa; Parikh, Parag; Olsen, Jeffrey",Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2017.11.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29277446/,12

RP v1.7 was designed for detection of species B, C, and E but may show variable detection of species A, D, and F. We sought to evaluate the clinical and analytical performance of RP v1.7 for detection of HAdV in a large pediatric cohort. Respiratory specimens obtained from a tertiary care children's hospital between February 2014 and February 2015 were tested for HAdV by RP v1.7. If the RP v1.7 results were negative for HAdV, then the specimens were reflexed to a HAdV-specific laboratory-developed PCR (LD-PCR) assay for confirmation. A subset of specimens underwent secondary confirmatory testing using another commercially available HAdV PCR assay and a molecular typing assay for species identification. Among 4,750 specimens, a total of 146 specimens (3.1%) were HAdV positive by RP v1.7. HAdV was detected by LD-PCR in an additional 220 specimens that were negative by RP v1.7. Overall, a nearly 5% increase in HAdV detection was observed when RP v1.7-negative specimens were reflexed to LD-PCR testing. RP v1.7 did not detect HAdV with either low viral burden (threshold cycle values of >30) or nonrespiratory species (species A, D, and F), as shown in both clinical and analytic data. While the level of sensitivity of RP v1.7 may be adequate for testing among otherwise healthy children, the decreased sensitivity may be problematic for immunocompromised patients, in whom low levels of HAdV in the respiratory tract may precede systemic infection and require early intervention.","Song, Eunkyung; Wang, Huanyu; Salamon, Doug; Jaggi, Preeti; Leber, Amy",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00143-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27008875/,12

Effective management of pain has an impact on clinical course and often depends on achieving an acceptable balance between opioid efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Common opioid-related adverse events such as nausea and vomiting are associated with an overall lower achievement of effective pain management and patient satisfaction. However, in practice, clinicians employ various strategies to maximize efficacy, minimize these adverse effects, and ensure the careful, judicious, and evidence-based use of opioids for patients who require them. Typical strategies for management and minimization of these types of adverse events include dose reduction, dose titration, opioid rotation, prescription for an antiemetic, and recommending the patient take opioids with food. Overall, the most straightforward approach that clinicians tend to employ that does not require additional visits or adjustment of prescriptions, is to recommend patients take opioids with food. However, given the current climate with opioids, it is critical and imperative that decisions for use of opioids be grounded in a solid and thorough evidence-base. In fact, several opioids are recommended to be taken explicitly with or without food because of interactions with abuse-deterrent technologies that can cause increased adverse events or inadequate analgesia. Therefore, we sought to review, synthesize, and summarize the literature for randomized, controlled trials and other studies to support the hypothesis that taking opioids with food reduces opioid-related events such as nausea and vomiting. Based on the current evidence we surveyed, the recommendation to take opioids with food does not appear to consistently and unequivocally reduce nausea and vomiting and, in many cases, increases the frequency of these adverse events in the studies we examined.","Raffa, Robert B; Colucci, Robert; Pergolizzi, Joseph V",Postgraduate medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2017.1345282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28635354/,12

Previously, the prevalence of burnout among Dutch intensivists was found to be low. Engagement and resilience among intensivists have not previously been studied quantitatively, however, both are related to burnout and provide a possible way to mitigate burnout. Our objective was to study burnout and its association with work engagement and resilience among Dutch intensivists in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS An online questionnaire was sent to all Dutch intensivists. The questionnaire consisted of questions on personal and work-related characteristics and validated questionnaires: the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, and the Resilience Evaluation Scale. RESULTS The response rate was 27.2% with 162 evaluable responses. Thirteen respondents (8.0%) were classified as having burnout, 63 (38.9%) respondents were reporting high work engagement. Burnout was found to be negatively associated with both work engagement and resilience. CONCLUSION In the aftermath of the 2020 COVID-19 crisis, we found a raised prevalence of burnout among intensivists, however this is still low in international comparisons. Intensivists with burnout scored low on resilience and low on work engagement.","Meynaar, Iwan A; Ottens, Thomas; Zegers, Marieke; van Mol, Margo M C; van der Horst, Iwan C C",Journal of critical care,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2020.11.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33232847/,12

Brain imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis of stroke and identification of the mechanism of stroke, which is relevant to acute treatment, prognosis, and secondary prevention. The chief potential modalities are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Currently, most imaging occurs in hospital but mobile stroke units have expanded CT brain imaging into the prehospital field. The proven therapies for ischemic stroke are based on achieving reperfusion and the DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials have now firmly established a need for imaging selection based on estimated ischemic core volume to guide reperfusion decisions in patients beyond 6 h of stroke onset. However, data also indicate that estimated ischemic core volume, in conjunction with patient factors and expected time delay to reperfusion, forms one of the most useful prognostic assessments that could alter decision-making for patients within 6 h. Current trials are also investigating agents that aim to achieve neuroprotection, reduction in edema or prevention of hemorrhagic transformation. Imaging may play a role in identifying patients likely to benefit from this next generation of interventions for stroke patients.","Campbell, Bruce Cv; Parsons, Mark W",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1747493018765235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29543140/,12
113543,Protective role of Astragaloside IV in chronic glomerulonephritis by activating autophagy through PI3K/AKT/AS160 pathway.,2020-07-29,"INTRODUCTION Single port laparoscopic access could reduce morbidity associated with additional trocar placement and, through the development of a hybrid intermediate, facilitate the clinical adoption of evolving techniques such as natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. Advanced trocar technology, as much as adapted surgical technique, seems necessary to best facilitate this, however. METHODS A novel port (Airseal, Surgiquest) that uses vortex technology to create an air-curtain seal to maintain the pneumoperitoneum while facilitating the simultaneous passage of multiple working instruments was trialed. For this, 6 pigs (30 kg each) underwent sigmoid resection and reanastomosis using the port as the sole laparoscopic access for conventional instrumentation. All animals were thereafter survived for observation during a 2-week convalescence before undergoing repeat general anesthesia, sigmoidoscopy for anastomotic assessment, and forensic laparotomy for determination of intraperitoneal healing and complications. RESULTS The operation was technically feasible via a single port within a short time in every animal (mean duration 12.3 minutes). One anastomosis had to redone because of staple misfire but this too was accomplishable without additional port placement. All animals survived and convalesced normally without evincing clinical complication. At follow-up, all anastomoses were patent at sigmoidoscopy and only 1 animal had evidence of complicated anastomotic healing (the same animal that had needed anastomotic refashioning). CONCLUSIONS Single port colonic resection and reanastomosis is readily achievable in this animal model. As an operative approach, it may both advance in its own right as much as facilitate the evolution and clinical incorporation of other developmental access routes.","Leroy, Joel; Cahill, Ronan A; Peretta, Silvana; Marescaux, Jacques",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350608324509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18805867/,12

This study describes a surgeon's experience with single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy and delineates a learning curve for this technically demanding procedure utilizing improvements in operative time as a proxy for technical facility. METHODS Through a 2-cm vertical transumbilical incision, three 5-mm ports or SILS™ Ports were placed using the Veress technique. One extracorporeal stay suture was utilized to provide cephalad retraction of the gallbladder fundus, and a roticulating instrument was used at the infundibulum for lateral retraction. The hilum was dissected and the cystic duct and artery were clipped and divided. One 5-mm port was removed and another upgraded to one 10-mm port to allow the introduction of a retrieval bag to facilitate the removal of the gallbladder from the abdomen. Patient demographic data, operative time, length of stay, surgical pathology, and complications were recorded. RESULTS Fifty-two of 54 patients successfully underwent single-port cholecystectomies. Two patients required conversion to either a conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy or open cholecystectomy. The average age was 41 years and average BMI was 30.2 kg/m(2). Mean operative time was 80 min. Length of stay was 0.3 days. The complication rate was 3/54 (5.5%). When patients were divided into sequential quintiles (n = 10), operative times decreased significantly after the first 10 patients (p = 0.0001) and then remained flat (p = 0.233). Operative times for obese patients (BMI >30) were greater than those for nonobese patients, but these results failed to reach statistical significance (85.3 vs. 69.7 min, p = 0.07). CONCLUSION The significant improvement in operative times after the first quintile followed by consistent results without subsequent variability suggests that the learning curve for the single-port cholecystectomy, in the hands of a fellowship-trained laparoscopic surgeon, is approximately ten cases.","Solomon, Daniel; Bell, Robert L; Duffy, Andrew J; Roberts, Kurt E",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1070-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20401494/,12
114183,Role of thermal ablation in the management of colorectal liver metastasis.,2020-02-01,"BACKGROUND Single-incision thoracoscopic surgery (SITS) is postulated to cause less incisional pain, less paresthesia, and less wound scarring than the conventional three-port approach. The difficulties performing the technique have prevented it from being widely accepted. This study shows how the authors overcame the difficulties by using the SILS port and proved it to be a safe and useful procedure for the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). METHODS The same surgeon operated on all the patients using the three-port technique (n = 13) and SITS (n = 27) under the same procedural and management policy. The two groups were retrospectively compared in terms of operation time, postoperative complications, hospital stay, pain score, residual paresthesia, satisfaction regarding the wound scar, and surgical material cost. RESULTS The mean age, sex ratio, and previous pneumothorax episodes were similar between the two groups. The uniport and three-port groups did not differ statistically in terms of mean operation time (74.6 ± 22.8 vs 72.4 ± 20.2 min; p = 0.77), hospital stay (2.3 ± 0.7 vs 2.5 ± 0.8 days; p = 0.72), visual analog pain scale (on the day of surgery: 4.1 ± 1.7 vs 4.8 ± 2.2, p = 0.26; on day 1: 3.2 ± 1.4 vs 2.8 ± 1.4, p = 0.33; on day 2: 2.7 ± 1.0 vs 2.6 ± 1.1, p = 0.61), or total surgical material cost (US$1,810 ± $320 vs $1,741 ± $329; p = 0.58). However, the uniport group had a lower incidence of paresthesia than the three-port group (33.3 vs 76.9%; p = 0.01) and showed a higher satisfaction rate regarding wound scarring (70.4 vs 30.7%; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Compared with the three-port approach, SITS using the SILS port in PSP patients proved to be a safe and feasible procedure that can be clinically implemented without additional economic burden or operation time. Additionally, SITS showed better cosmesis with minimized neurologic sequelae, which contributed to higher satisfaction among patients. Progress in uniport instruments and surgical experience will lead to wider applications of SITS.","Yang, Hee Chul; Cho, Sukki; Jheon, Sanghoon",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2381-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22692464/,12

114427,Editorial: Advances in Gastrointestinal Immunology.,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The use of stents in the setting of SAH is controversial because of concerns about the efficacy and risk of dual antiplatelet therapy. We compare complications of stent-assisted coil embolization in patients with acutely ruptured aneurysms with complications in patients with unruptured aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between February 2007 and March 2015, 45 acutely ruptured aneurysms and 47 unruptured aneurysms were treated with stent-assisted coiling. Patients with ruptured aneurysms were not pretreated with antiplatelet medication but received intravenous aspirin during the procedure. Thromboembolic events and early rebleeds were recorded. RESULTS In ruptured aneurysms, 9 of 45 patients had thromboembolic complications. Four patients remained asymptomatic, 4 developed infarctions, and 1 patient died. The permanent complication rate in ruptured aneurysms was 11% (95% CI, 4%-24%). Five of 45 patients (11%; 95% CI, 4%-24%) had an early rebleed from the treated aneurysm after 3-45 days, and in 4, this rebleed was fatal. In 46 patients with 47 unruptured aneurysms, thromboembolic complications occurred in 2. One patient remained asymptomatic; the other had a thalamus infarction. The complication rate in unruptured aneurysms was 2.2% (1 of 46; 95% CI, 0.01%-12%). No first-time hemorrhages occurred in 46 patients with 47 aneurysms during 6 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The complication rate of stent-assisted coiling with early adverse events in ruptured aneurysms was 10 times higher than that in unruptured aneurysms. Early rebleed accounted for most mortality. In ruptured aneurysms, stent-assisted coil embolization is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and should only be considered when less risky options have been excluded.","Bechan, R S; Sprengers, M E; Majoie, C B; Peluso, J P; Sluzewski, M; van Rooij, W J",AJNR.

Materials and Methods This was a single center, retrospective, descriptive and observational study using cross-sectional data, which were collected from confirmed COVID-19 patients at a tertiary education hospital. Patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, mortality rates, and the factors associated with hospitalization were analyzed. Result By May 15, 2020, 480 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 in our hospital where 49 (10.2%) of whom were HCWs. The mean age was 40.0 ± 8.45 (75.5% female). The most common symptoms were cough (32.7%), fever (30.6%), and myalgia (14.3%). Comorbidities were present in 32.7% of the patients. Most of the HCWs were nurses (53.1%) and physicians (18.4%), and the remaining 14 (28.6%) were cleaning and administrative staff. The severity of the disease was mild in 65.3% and severe in 34.7% HCWs. Leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet values were statistically lower in hospitalized patients. There was a statistically significant relationship between the presence of infiltration on the chest X-ray, and the patient's symptoms with the severity of the disease (respectively p= 0.002 and 0.009). Conclusions In conclusion, the frequency of COVID-19 in healthcare workers is high.

However, the lithium morphological instabilities accompanied by continuous side reactions with electrolytes inevitably leads to dissatisfactory performances and even safety issues, where the unstable interface between lithium metal anode and electrolytes has been regarded as the root cause. Artificial solid electrolyte interphase engineering has attracted a large amount of attention to stabilize lithium metal anodes. Here, a novel method with universality is reported to produce the organic-inorganic artificial solid electrolyte interphase. Using polypropylene carbonate as sacrificial matrix, nanoparticles are dispersed on lithium metal anodes surface uniformly to prepare artificial solid electrolyte interphase, where polypropylene carbonate turns into liquid propylene carbonate upon contact with lithium metal anode. Silicon, Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 or Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 nanoparticles are coated to suppress lithium morphological instabilities and demonstrated ~4 times longer cycle life. Preparing various organic/inorganic artificial solid electrolyte interphase is feasible by introducing various components in the fabrication process of polypropylene carbonate membrane, endowing this approach with huge potential in the research of artificial solid electrolyte interphase.","Yu, Qipeng; Mai, Weicong; Xue, Weijiang; Xu, Guiyin; Liu, Qi; Zeng, Kun; Liu, Yuanming; Kang, Feiyu; Li, Baohua; Li, Ju",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c04205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32432462/,12
114833,Genetically Engineered Mouse Model of Brainstem High-Grade Glioma.,2020-12-18,"Diagnostic tests for respiratory viral infections have traditionally been performed on nasopharyngeal swabs or washings. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is rapid, sensitive, and specific for viral infection diagnosis but is rarely applied to sputum samples. Thus, we evaluated the diagnostic yield of RT-PCR for detection of nine virus types by the use of nose and throat swabs (NTS) and sputum samples from patients admitted to the hospital with acute respiratory tract illnesses. Adults hospitalized with acute respiratory tract illnesses were recruited during the winters of 2008 and 2009. At enrollment, combined nose and throat swabs and sputum samples were collected for RT-PCR for detection of nine common respiratory virus types. A total of 532 subjects admitted for 556 respiratory illnesses were enrolled. A total of 189 virus strains were identified. The diagnostic yields for detection of any virus were 23% (126/556) for NTS RT-PCR and 36% (146/404) for sputum RT-PCR. A total of 83 (44%) of 189 viral detections were positive by both methods, 43 (23%) were positive by NTS alone, and 63 (33%) were positive only with sputum samples. The inclusion of RT-PCR performed with sputum samples significantly increased the diagnostic yield for respiratory viral infections in adults.

Whilst significant efforts have been made to examine and enhance patient experience, to date little has progressed in relation to provider experience. This review aims to explore this knowledge gap by capturing evidence of clinician experience, and how this experience is defined and measured in the context of health system change and innovation. METHODS A rapid review of published and grey literature review was conducted utilising a rapid evidence assessment methodology. Seventy-nine studies retrieved from the literature were included in the review. Fourteen articles were identified from the grey literature search and one article obtained via hand searching. In total, 94 articles were included in the review. This study was commissioned by and co-designed with the New South Wales, Ministry of Health. RESULTS Clinician experience of delivering health care is inconsistently defined in the literature, with identified articles lacking clarity regarding distinctions between experience, engagement and work-related outcomes such as job satisfaction. Clinician experience was commonly explored using qualitative research that focused on experiences of discrete health care activities or events in which a change was occurring. Such research enabled exploration of complex experiences. In these contexts, clinician experience was captured in terms of self-reported information that clinicians provided about the health care activity or event, their perceptions of its value, the lived impacts they experienced, and the specific behaviours they displayed in relation to the activity or event. Moreover, clinician's experience has been identified to have a paucity of measurement tools. CONCLUSION Literature to date has not examined clinician experience in a holistic sense. In order to achieve the goals identified in relation to value-based care, further work is needed to conceptualise clinician experience and understand the nature of measurement tools required to assess this. In health system application, a broader 'clinician pulse' style assessment may be valuable to understand the experience of clinical work on a continuum rather than in the context of episodes of change/care.","Pervaz Iqbal, Maha; Manias, Elizabeth; Mimmo, Laurel; Mears, Stephen; Jack, Briony; Hay, Liz; Harrison, Reema",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05812-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33059673/,12

In this study, we evaluated clinical utility of 3D high-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (HR-VWI) in patients with diffuse nonaneurysmal SAH. METHODS A total of 17 patients with diffuse nonaneurysmal SAH were included in this retrospective study. We characterized demographics and HR-VWI findings and reviewed the clinical management and outcomes. RESULTS Of the patients 14 (14/17; 82.4%,) showed abnormal findings on HR-VWI, including 5 with intracranial dissections (29.4%), 3 with blood blister-like aneurysm (17.6%), 1 with ruptured fusiform aneurysm (5.9%), and 5 with focal nodular wall enhancement without unclassified pathology (29.4%). Of these patients were treated with endovascular management. Most patients (16/17) had a favorable modified Rankin scale scores of 0-2 on discharge. CONCLUSION The 3D HR-VWI revealed various hidden pathologies, such as intracranial arterial dissection, blood blister-like aneurysm, and fusiform aneurysm in patients with diffuse nonaneurysmal SAH. In addition, 3D HR-VWI had an impact on the management of SAH.

Only small studies reported the results. Our aim was to provide an overview of the outcomes of double and triple femoral neck lengthening. Methods After an extensive search of different online databases, we included studies reporting the results of double and triple femoral neck osteotomies. Clinical and radiological outcomes, and reported complications were extracted. The review process was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results After evaluating 456 articles, we included 11 articles reporting 149 osteotomies in 143 patients (31% male, 64% female, 5% unspecified). Mean age of the patients was 20 years (range 7 years to 52 years). Indications were developmental hip dysplasia (51%), Perthes disease (27%), infection (6%), post-trauma (4%), congenital disorders (2%), slipped capital femoral epiphysis (1%), idiopathic (3%) and unknown (6%). The mean limb length discrepancy reduced by 12 mm (0 mm to 40 mm). In total, 65% of 101 positive Trendelenburg sign hips experienced improvement of abductor muscle strength. An 18% (9% to 36%) increase could be found in functional hip scores. Mean increase in articulo-trochanteric distance was 24 mm (10 mm to 34 mm). Five patients older than 30 years at the time of osteotomy and two younger patients with prior hip incongruency had disappointing results and required arthroplasty. In all, 12 complications occurred in 128 osteotomies, in which complications were reported.

115556,Flexible electrochemical uric acid and glucose biosensor.,2021-06-06,"Apolipoproteins (apo) are constituents of lipoproteins crucial for lipid homeostasis. Aberrant expression of apolipoproteins is associated with metabolic abnormalities. Here we characterized apolipoprotein D (apoD) in triglyceride metabolism. Unlike canonical apolipoproteins that are mainly produced in the liver, apoD is an atypical apolipoprotein with broad tissue distribution. We show that circulating apoD is present mainly in HDL and, to a lesser extent, in LDL and VLDL and that its plasma levels were reduced in db/db mice with visceral obesity and altered lipid metabolism. Elevated apoD production, derived from adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, resulted in significant reduction in plasma triglyceride levels in mice. This effect was attributable to en-hanced LPL activity and improved catabolism of triglyceride-rich particles. In contrast, VLDL triglyceride production remained unchanged in response to elevated apoD production. These findings were recapitulated in high-fat-induced obese mice. Obese mice with elevated apoD production exhibited significantly improved triglyceride profiles, correlating with increased plasma LPL activity and enhanced postprandial fat tolerance. ApoD was shown to promote LPL-mediated hydrolysis of VLDL in vitro, correlating with its TG-lowering action in vivo. Apolipoprotein D plays a significant role in lipid metabolism. These data provide important clues to clinical observations that genetic variants of apoD are associated with abnormal lipid metabolism and increased risk of metabolic syndrome.","Perdomo, German; Kim, Dae Hyun; Zhang, Ting; Qu, Shen; Thomas, Elizabeth A; Toledo, Frederico G S; Slusher, Sandra; Fan, Yong; Kelley, David E; Dong, H Henry",Journal of lipid research,https://doi.org/10.1194/jlr.m001206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20124557/,12

There is some controversy about whether RA is associated with infection and complications after spinal surgery. This study aims to determine the effect of RA on spinal surgery infection and complications. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. All studies that compared patients who underwent spinal operation with and without RA were included in the analysis. RESULTS There were statistically significant higher rates of complications (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.20-1.70, p < 0.05) and infections (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.46-1.95, p <0.05) in RA than in non-RA patients undergoing spinal surgery. When registry data were excluded, the study suggested that complications and infections were still higher in the patients with RA than in the non-RA patient groups, (OR 2.24, 95% CI 0.92-5.44, p = 0.08) and (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.50-2.07,p < 0.05) respectively. CONCLUSION When undergoing spinal surgery, patients with RA are at higher risks of operative complications and infection.

Current UK national guidance recommends VGCs for patients with ocular hypertension, glaucoma suspects or early glaucoma. This study evaluates whether expanded eligibility criteria, including other glaucoma phenotypes and disease stages, can deliver safe and effective care with a positive patient experience. METHODS Records of over 8000 patients were reviewed in order to determine suitability for VGC attendance using expanded eligibility criteria. Patients with three prior consecutive visits within the glaucoma service were included. Follow-up interval, clinic type, visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure (IOP) and visual field performance were recorded. Patient satisfaction was recorded for a sample of 118 patients. RESULTS 2017 patients over 31 months were included. Two-thirds of eyes had ocular comorbidities, a fifth of eyes had undergone prior cataract surgery and 10% of eyes had undergone a prior laser treatment for glaucoma. After three visits, 32% of patients remained in the VGC, 42% were seen in face-to-face clinics and 25% were discharged. There were no clinically significant changes in VA, IOP and visual field performance during follow-up. 72% of patients expressed a preference to continue their care within VGCs. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that VGCs with expanded patient eligibility criteria can deliver high-quality glaucoma care that is safe, effective and with high levels of patient satisfaction.

Although there is an association between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19, the majority of patients who need cardiovascular care for the management of ischemic heart disease may not be infected with COVID-19. The objective of this document is to provide recommendations for a systematic approach for the care of patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a recognition of two major challenges in providing recommendations for AMI care in the COVID-19 era. Cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are complex with patients presenting with AMI, myocarditis simulating a ST-elevation MI presentation, stress cardiomyopathy, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary spasm, or nonspecific myocardial injury and the prevalence of COVID-19 disease in the US population remains unknown with risk of asymptomatic spread. This document addresses the care of these patients focusing on 1) the varied clinical presentations; 2) appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) for health care workers; 3) role of the Emergency Department, Emergency Medical System and the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory; and 4) Regional STEMI systems of care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, primary PCI remains the standard of care for STEMI patients at PCI capable hospitals when it can be provided in a timely fashion, with an expert team outfitted with PPE in a dedicated CCL room. A fibrinolysis-based strategy may be entertained at non-PCI capable referral hospitals or in specific situations where primary PCI cannot be executed or is not deemed the best option.

116238,"Targeting HIV-1 RNase H: N'-(2-Hydroxy-benzylidene)-3,4,5-Trihydroxybenzoylhydrazone as Selective Inhibitor Active against NNRTIs-Resistant Variants.",2020-07-06,"BACKGROUND Planning for mass critical care in resource-poor and constrained settings has been largely ignored, despite large, densely crowded populations who are prone to suffer disproportionately from natural disasters. As a result, disaster response has been suboptimal and in many instances hampered by lack of planning, education and training, information, and communication. METHODS The Resource-Poor Settings panel developed five key question domains; defining the term resource poor and using the traditional phases of the disaster cycle (mitigation/preparedness/response/recovery). Literature searches were conducted to identify evidence to answer the key questions in these areas. Given a lack of data on which to develop evidence-based recommendations, expert-opinion suggestions were developed, and consensus was achieved using a modified Delphi process. RESULTS The five key questions were as follows: definition, capacity building and mitigation, what resources can we bring to bear to assist/surge, response, and reconstitution and recovery of host nation critical care capabilities. Addressing these led the panel to offer 33 suggestions. Because of the large number of suggestions, the results have been separated into two sections: part I, Infrastructure/Capacity in the accompanying article, and part II, Response/Recovery/Research in this article. CONCLUSIONS A lack of rudimentary ICU resources and capacity to enhance services plagues resource-poor or constrained settings. Capacity building therefore entails preventative strategies and strengthening of primary health services. Assistance from other countries and organizations is often needed to mount a surge response. Moreover, the disengagement of these responding groups and host country recovery require active planning. Future improvements in all phases require active research activities.","Geiling, James; Burkle, Frederick M; West, T Eoin; Uyeki, Timothy M; Amundson, Dennis; Dominguez-Cherit, Guillermo; Gomersall, Charles D; Lim, Matthew L; Luyckx, Valerie; Sarani, Babak; Christian, Michael D; Devereaux, Asha V; Dichter, Jeffrey R; Kissoon, Niranjan",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.14-0745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25144410/,12

METHODS This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among patients admitted from March to August 2020 in a referral hospital, Tehran, Iran. All patients aged 18-65 who had not any comorbidity participated in the study. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was established using the rRT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Then the incidence of lung involvement and biochemical markers including vitamin D level, c-reactive protein, D-dimer, lymphocyte count, platelet count, white blood cell count, and lactic acid dehydrogenase, were extracted through medical records. RESULTS Altogether, 84 patients met our study criteria, and the information of 68 (80.9%) participants were collected. Among all 68 patients, 45 (66.2%) were male. The mean (SD) age of all participants was 52.4 (10.4) years old. Among 24 (35.2%) clients who died due to SARS-CoV-2, 20 (83.3%) patients were male (p=0.02). The mean (SD) of vitamin D level was 24.1 (13.6) ng/dL. No association between vitamin D level and prognostic factors, including CRP, lymphocyte count, D-dimer, LDH, and HRCT scan score, was observed. Also, the vitamin D level of the dead patients was not significantly different from that of the treated patients. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicated no significant relationship between vitamin D level and prognostic factors or outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Haghighi, Mehrdad; Ebadi, Seyed Shayan; Soleimantabar, Hussein; Shadkam, Atefe; Ebadi, Seyed Alireza; Afzali, Hasan",Hormone molecular biology and clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1515/hmbci-2021-0008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34005841/,12

This Review summarizes and comments on the opportunities for broad-spectrum agents that are active against multiple flaviviruses. Broad-spectrum activity is particularly desirable to prepare for the next flaviviral epidemic, which could emerge from as-yet unknown or neglected viruses. Potential molecular targets for broad-spectrum antiflaviviral compounds include viral proteins, such as the viral protease or polymerase, and host targets that are exploited by these viruses during entry and replication, including α-glucosidase and proteins involved in nucleoside biosynthesis. Numerous compounds with broad-spectrum antiviral activity have already been identified by target-specific or phenotypic assays. For other compounds, broad-spectrum activity can be anticipated because of their mode of action and molecular targets.","Boldescu, Veaceslav; Behnam, Mira A M; Vasilakis, Nikos; Klein, Christian D",Nature reviews.

117620,TLR3 controls constitutive IFN-β antiviral immunity in human fibroblasts and cortical neurons.,2021-01-04,"INTRODUCTION Although appendectomies are frequently performed and new procedural techniques have emerged, no nationwide analysis exists after the cessation of the German quality control in 2004. METHODS One thousand eight hundred seventy surgical hospitals in Germany were asked to answer questions anonymously concerning the size of the department, applied procedural techniques, various technical details, as well as the approach to the intraoperative finding of an inconspicuous appendix. RESULTS We received 643 questionnaires (34.4 %) for evaluation. Almost all hospitals (95.5 %) offer laparoscopic appendectomy (LA), 15.4 % offer single-port (SPA), and 2.2 % (hybrid-) NOTES technique (NA). LA is the standard procedure in 85.2 % of male and in 89.1 % for female patients. In an open procedure (OA), the appendix and mesoappendix are mostly ligated (93.8 and 91.5 %). A Veress needle and open access are employed equally for LA. In 66.6 % of LA, the appendix is divided using an Endo-GIA, the mesoappendix in 45.5 % with bipolar coagulation. Almost half of the hospitals routinely flush the site in OA and LA. In open surgery with an inconspicuous appendix but a pathological finding elsewhere in the abdomen, it is resected ""en principe"" in 64.7 % and in the absence of any pathological finding in 91.2 %. For laparoscopic procedures, the numbers are 54.8 and 88.4 %. CONCLUSIONS Most German hospitals perform appendectomies laparoscopically regardless of patients' gender. Usage of an Endo-GIA is widely established. SPA has not gained much acceptance, nor is NA widely used yet. In the absence of any pathological findings in particular, the macroscopically inconspicuous appendix results in an appendectomy ""en principe"" in most German hospitals.","Bulian, Dirk Rolf; Knuth, Jürgen; Sauerwald, Axel; Ströhlein, Michael Alfred; Lefering, Rolf; Ansorg, Jörg; Heiss, Markus Maria",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-012-1573-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22932909/,12
117625,Maladaptation of U.S. corn and soybeans to a changing climate.,2021-06-11,"Deep emotional traumas in societies overwhelmed by large-scale human disasters, like, global pandemic diseases, natural disasters, man-made tragedies, war conflicts, social crises, etc., can cause massive stress-related disorders. Motivated by the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic, the article provides an overview of scientific evidence regarding adverse impact of diverse human disasters on mental health in afflicted groups and societies. Following this broader context, psychosocial impact of COVID-19 as a specific global human disaster is presented, with an emphasis on disturbing mental health aspects of the ongoing pandemic. Limited resources of mental health services in a number of countries around the world are illustrated, which will be further stretched by the forthcoming increase in demand for mental health services due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health challenges are particularly important for the Republic of Croatia in the current situation, due to disturbing stress of the 2020 Zagreb earthquake and the high pre-pandemic prevalence of chronic Homeland-War-related posttraumatic stress disorders. Comprehensive approach based on digital psychiatry is proposed to address the lack of access to psychiatric services, which includes artificial intelligence, telepsychiatry and an array of new technologies, like internet-based computer-aided mental health tools and services. These tools and means should be utilized as an important part of the whole package of measures to mitigate negative mental health effects of the global coronavirus pandemic. Our scientific and engineering experiences in the design and development of digital tools and means in mitigation of stress-related disorders and assessment of stress resilience are presented. Croatian initiative on enhancement of interdisciplinary research of psychiatrists, psychologists and computer scientists on the national and EU level is important in addressing pressing mental health concerns related to the ongoing pandemic and similar human disasters.","Ćosić, Krešimir; Popović, Siniša; Šarlija, Marko; Kesedžić, Ivan",Psychiatria Danubina,https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.25; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303026/,12

PURPOSE To evaluate the technical and clinical success of percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy in restoring patency of acutely and chronically thrombosed covered TIPS using the Aspirex®S and Rotarex®S system. MATERIAL AND METHODS We evaluated mechanical thrombectomy-assisted revisions in five patients between January 2012 and April 2021. Two patients had to be revised twice due to recurrent occlusion. We designated thrombosis within 10 days after shunt creation or revision as acute. Insidious deterioration of portal hypertension related symptoms for at least 6-8 weeks was recorded in chronic cases. We treated four acute and three chronic occlusions. After transjugular lesion crossing, we performed two mechanical thrombectomy device passages. If indicated, balloon dilatation, covered stent placement, or variceal embolization were added. RESULTS The technical success rate was 100%. No procedure-related complications occurred. In one patient with acute decompensation of Budd-Chiari syndrome and acute-on-chronic liver failure, early re-thrombosis occurred twice with patency intervals of up to eight days. In contrast, stable patency was achieved in the other four patients with documented patency intervals of at least five months and improvement of portal hypertension-related symptoms, resulting in a patient based clinical success rate of 80%. CONCLUSION In five patients, percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy assisted TIPS recanalization of four acute and three chronic occlusions proved to be technically feasible and safe with a high clinical success rate.","Thurner, Annette; Augustin, Anne Marie; Götze, Oliver; Bley, Thorsten A; Kickuth, Ralph",Acta radiologica,https://doi.org/10.1177/02841851211034041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323588/,12

SAMPLE 97 E coli isolates from diarrheic neonatal calves. PROCEDURES E coli isolates were tested via PCR assay for 6 virulence genes and susceptibility to 17 drugs belonging to 9 classes. A 2-sample test of proportions was used to make comparisons between proportions of virulent and avirulent MDR isolates. RESULTS 23 of 97 (23.7%) isolates were virulent, and 74 (76.3%) were avirulent. Of the 23 virulent isolates, 15 (65.2%) were positive for K99, 14 (60.9%) for F41, 12 (52.2%) for STa, 9 (39.1%) for Stx1, 6 (26.1%) for intimin, and 0 (0%) for Stx2. Twenty of 23 (87.0%) virulent isolates expressed ≥ 2 virulence genes, and 3 of 23 (13.0%) were positive for 1 virulence factor. Eight of 23 (34.8%) virulent isolates expressed STa, K99, and F41, whereas 1 of 23 (4.4%) was positive for STa, F41, intimin, and Stx1. The second most frequent gene pattern was Stx1 and intimin. Twenty of 23 (87.0%) virulent isolates were MDR; the highest prevalence of resistance was recorded for the macrolide-lincosides, followed by the tetracyclines and penicillins. Also, 17 of 23 (74.0%) virulent isolates were resistant to sulfadimethoxine, and 10 of 23 (43.5%) were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Additionally, 60 of 74 (81.0%) avirulent isolates were MDR. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The prevalence of multidrug resistance was comparable for virulent and avirulent E coli isolated from diarrheic neonatal calves.

119732,"Clinical, endoscopic, and histologic characteristics of lymphocytic esophagitis: a systematic review.",2019,"BACKGROUND Current techniques in rotator cuff repair often lack structural integrity. P2 porous titanium-coated constructs (DJO Surgical, Austin, TX, USA) promote osseointegration and soft tissue ingrowth. This study examined the ability of this material to improve the structural integrity of supraspinatus tendon repair in a rat model. We hypothesized that P2 implants placed at the tendon-to-bone interface would improve mechanical and histologic measures of supraspinatus healing. METHODS Forty rats underwent supraspinatus repairs with P2 implants in 1 shoulder and standard repair in the other. Rats were humanely killed at time 0 (n = 3), 2 weeks (n = 8), 4 weeks (n = 15), and 12 weeks (n = 14). Tendon-to-bone composite specimens were harvested and evaluated mechanically and histologically. RESULTS Tendon cross-sectional area was decreased in the P2 implant group at 4 weeks, percentage of relaxation was increased at 2 weeks, elastic modulus was increased at 4 weeks, and maximum load and maximum stress were both increased at 2 and 4 weeks. Histologic analysis revealed no foreign body reactions within or around the P2 implant, and healthy viable bone was visible within the P2 implant. CONCLUSION The results support our hypothesis, specifically in early healing, in this randomized controlled animal study. These data support the use of P2 porous titanium implants to improve tendon-to-bone healing.","Tucker, Jennica J; Gordon, Joshua A; Zanes, Robert C; Zuskov, Andrey; Vinciguerra, John D; Bloebaum, Roy D; Soslowsky, Louis J",Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jse.2016.09.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27751717/,12

The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has made the world aware of the scale of the threat. The surfaces of various materials can be a source of viruses that remain temporarily contagious in the environment. Few polymers have antiviral effects that reduce infectivity or the presence of a virus in the human environment. Some of the effects are due to certain physical properties, e.g., high hydrophobicity. Other materials owe their antiviral activity to a modified physicochemical structure favoring the action on specific virus receptors or on their biochemistry. Current research areas include: gluten, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyimide, polylactic acid, graphene oxide, and polyurethane bound to copper oxide. The future belongs to multi-component mixtures or very thin multilayer systems.

Labetalol is frequently used to lower maternal blood pressure and prolong pregnancy. Conflicting evidence exists for specific neonatal side effects described after maternal labetalol treatment. Our aim was to investigate neonatal effects of foetal exposure to labetalol on cerebral oxygenation and extraction. METHODS In a prospective observational study, clinical characteristics, vital parameters and cerebral oxygen delivery and extraction were collected during the first 24 h of life in labetalol-exposed preterm neonates and compared with two control groups. RESULTS Twenty-two infants with a mean gestational age of 28.9 weeks, born from labetalol-treated mothers with HDP were included and matched with 22 infants with non-labetalol-treated mothers with HDP and 22 infants without maternal HDP. No significant differences between groups were found neither in heart rate, blood pressure and inotropic support, nor in mean regional cerebral oxygen saturation and fractional tissue oxygen extraction. CONCLUSION Foetal labetalol exposure associated effects on preterm heart rate, blood pressure, cerebral oxygenation and extraction are not demonstrated. Maternal disease severity seems to play a more important role in neonatal cerebral haemodynamics. Maternal labetalol treatment has no clinically important short term side effects in the preterm neonate.","Thewissen, Liesbeth; Pistorius, Lou; Baerts, Wim; Naulaers, Gunnar; Van Bel, Frank; Lemmers, Petra","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2016.1193145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27294851/,12

Methods: Data of COVID-19 cases reported in Guangzhou and Wenzhou as of 29 February, 2020 were collected. The incidence curves of COVID-19 in two cities were constructed. The real time reproduction number (R(t)) of COVID-19 in two cities was calculated respectively. Results: A total of 346 and 465 confirmed COVID-19 cases were analysed in Guangzhou and Wenzhou, respectively. In two cities, most cases were aged 30-59 years (Guangzhou: 54.9%; Wenzhou: 70.3%). The incidence curve peaked on 27 January, 2020 in Guangzhou and on 26 January, 2020 in Wenzhou, then began to decline in both cities. The peaks of imported COVID-19 cases from Hubei occurred earlier than the peak of COVID-19 incidences in two cities, and the peak of imported cases from Hubei occurred earlier in Wenzhou than in Guangzhou. In early epidemic phase, imported cases were predominant in both cities, then the number of local cases increased and gradually took the dominance in Wenzhou. In Guangzhou, the imported cases was still predominant. Despite the different epidemic pattern, the R(t) and the number of COVID-19 cases declined after strict prevention and control measures were taken in Guangzhou and in Wenzhou. Conclusion: The time and scale specific differences of imported COVID-19 resulted in different epidemic patterns in two cities, but the spread of the disease were effectively controlled after taking strict prevention and control measures.","He, G H; Rong, Z H; Hu, J X; Liu, T; Xiao, J P; Guo, L C; Zeng, W L; Zhu, Z H; Gong, D X; Yin, L H; Wan, D H; Wu, J L; Kang, M; Song, T; He, J F; Ma, W J",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200303-00242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32244261/,12

METHODS This study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial conducted by a provincial hospital in China. According to different feeding intervals, 78 eligible participants were randomly divided into Group A (2-h interval, n = 39) and Group B (3-h interval, n = 39). The basic clinical data, total feeding time, incidence of feeding intolerance, and nurse job satisfaction scores of the two groups were collected. RESULTS The total feeding time in Group A was significantly longer than that in Group B (142.5 ± 15.4 vs. 132.0 ± 16.1 min/d, p = .020). The nurse job satisfaction scores in Group A were significantly lower than those in Group B (101.7 ± 9.8 vs. 108.8 ± 10.1, p = .005). There were no significant differences in the duration of mechanical ventilation (3.7 ± 1.1 vs. 3.9 ± 1.0 d, p = .272), length of ICU stay (4.5 ± 1.1 d vs. 4.7 ± 0.9 d, p = .451), or length of hospital stay (13.2 ± 1.4 vs. 13.3 ± 1.0 d, p = .642) between the two groups. Although the incidence of feeding intolerance in Group A was slightly lower than that in Group B, the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION Feeding at an interval of 2 or 3 h has no significant effect on the feeding outcomes of infants, and feeding at intervals of 3 h can reduce nurses' workload and improve nursing job satisfaction.","Liu, Jian-Feng; Xie, Wen-Peng; Lei, Yu-Qing; Cao, Hua; Yu, Xian-Rong; Chen, Qiang",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.15933; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34423474/,12

The purpose of this study was to estimate the effective concentration of remifentanil in 95% of patients (EC95) for the prevention of emergence cough after LMS under propofol anesthesia using the biased coin design (BCD) up-down method.A total of 40 adult patients scheduled to undergo elective LMS were enrolled. Anesthesia induction and maintenance were performed with target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. Effective effect-site concentration (Ce) of remifentanil in 95% of patients for preventing emergence cough was estimated using a BCD method (starting from 1 ng/mL with a step size of 0.4 ng/mL). Hemodynamic and recovery profiles were observed after anesthesia.According to the study protocol, 20 patients were allocated to receive remifentanil Ce of 3.0 ng/mL, and 20 patients were assigned to receive lower concentrations of remifentanil, from 1.0 to 2.6 ng/mL. Based on isotonic regression with a bootstrapping method, EC95 (95% CI) of remifentanil Ce for the prevention of emergence cough from LMS was found to be 2.92 ng/mL (2.72-2.97 ng/mL). Compared with patients receiving lower concentrations of remifentanil, the incidence of hypoventilation before extubation and extubation time were significantly higher in those receiving remifentanil Ce of 3.0 ng/mL. However, hypoventilation incidence after extubation and staying time in the recovery room were comparable between the 2 groups.Using a BCD method, the EC95 of remifentanil Ce for the prevention of emergence cough was estimated to be 2.92 ng/mL (95% CI: 2.72-2.97 ng/mL) after LMS under propofol anesthesia.","Kim, Ha Yeon; Kim, Jong Yeop; Ahn, Soo Hwan; Lee, Sook Young; Park, Hee Yeon; Kwak, Hyun Jeong",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000011258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29952995/,12
121621,Fluorescent light energy modulates healing in skin grafted mouse model.,2021,"We previously reported that transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), were highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, which resulted in the development of disease of various severity and even death in some lineages. In this study, we further characterized and compared the pathogeneses of SARS-CoV infection in two of the most stable Tg lineages, AC70 and AC22, representing those susceptible and resistant to the lethal SARS-CoV infection, respectively. The kinetics of virus replication and the inflammatory responses within the lungs and brains, as well as the clinical and pathological outcomes, were assessed in each lineage. In addition, we generated information on lymphocyte subsets and mitogen-mediated proliferation of splenocytes. We found that while both lineages were permissive to SARS-CoV infection, causing elevated secretion of many inflammatory mediators within the lungs and brains, viral infection appeared to be more intense in AC70 than in AC22 mice, especially in the brain. Moreover, such infection was accompanied by a more profound immune suppression in the former, as evidenced by the extensive loss of T cells, compromised responses to concanavalin A stimulation, and absence of inflammatory infiltrates within the brain. We also found that CD8(+) T cells were partially effective in attenuating the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection in lethality-resistant AC22 mice. Collectively, our data revealed a more intense viral infection and immunosuppression in AC70 mice than in AC22 mice, thereby providing us with an immunopathogenic basis for the fatal outcome of SARS-CoV infection in the AC70 mice.","Yoshikawa, Naoko; Yoshikawa, Tomoki; Hill, Terence; Huang, Cheng; Watts, Douglas M; Makino, Shinji; Milligan, Gregg; Chan, Tehsheng; Peters, Clarence J; Tseng, Chien-Te K",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02272-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19297479/,12

121921,Protein signatures of seminal plasma from bulls with contrasting frozen-thawed sperm viability.,2020-09-04,"BACKGROUND The reported high mortality of COVID-19 patients in intensive care has given rise to a debate over whether patients with this disease are being intubated too soon and might instead benefit from more non-invasive ventilation. METHODS This review is based on articles published up to 12 June 2020 that were retrieved by a selective literature search on the topic of invasive and non-invasive ventilation for respiratory failure in COVID-19. Guideline recommendations and study data on patients with respiratory failure in settings other than COVID-19 are also considered, as are the current figures of the intensive care registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (Deutsche Interdisziplinäre Vereinigung für Intensiv- und Notfallmedizin). RESULTS The high mortality figures among patients receiving invasive ventilation that have been reported in studies from abroad cannot be uncritically applied to the current situation in Germany. Study data on ventilation specifically in COVID-19 patients would be needed to do justice to the special pathophysiology of this disease, but such data are lacking. Being intubated too early is evidently associated with risks for the patient, but being intubated too late is as well. A particularly im - portant consideration is the potential harm associated with prolonged spontaneous breathing, with or without non-invasive assistance, as any increase in respiratory work can seriously worsen respiratory failure. On the other hand, it is clearly unacceptable to intubate patients too early merely out of concern that the medical staff might become infected with COVID-19 if they were ventilated non-invasively. CONCLUSION Nasal high flow, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive ventilation with intubation should be carried out in a stepwise treatment strategy, under appropriate intensive-care monitoring and with the observance of all relevant anti-infectious precautions. Germany is better prepared that other countries to provide COVID-19 patients with appropriate respiratory care, in view of the high per capita density of intensive-care beds and the availability of a nationwide, interdisciplinary intensive care registry for the guidance and coordination of intensive care in patients who need it.","Windisch, Wolfram; Weber-Carstens, Steffen; Kluge, Stefan; Rossaint, Rolf; Welte, Tobias; Karagiannidis, Christian",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.2020.0528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32900426/,12
121964,Comparative transcriptome analysis during developmental stages of direct somatic embryogenesis in Tilia amurensis Rupr.,2021-03-18,"BACKGROUND The transcription factor YY1 is an important regulator for metabolic homeostasis. Activating mutations in YY1 lead to tumorigenesis of pancreatic β-cells, however, the physiological functions of YY1 in β-cells are still unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of YY1 ablation on insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. METHODS We established two models of β-cell-specific YY1 knockout mice. The glucose metabolic phenotypes, β-cell mass and β-cell functions were analyzed in the mouse models. Transmission electron microscopy was used to detect the ultrastructure of β-cells. The flow cytometry analysis, measurement of OCR and ROS were performed to investigate the mitochondrial function. Histological analysis, quantitative PCR and ChIP were performed to analyze the target genes of YY1 in β-cells. RESULTS Our results showed that loss of YY1 resulted in reduction of insulin production, β-cell mass and glucose tolerance in mice. Ablation of YY1 led to defective ATP production and mitochondrial ROS accumulation in pancreatic β-cells. The inactivation of YY1 impaired the activity of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, induced mitochondrial dysfunction and diabetes in mouse models. CONCLUSION Our findings demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of YY1 is essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial functions and insulin secretion in β-cells.","Song, Dalong; Yang, Qi; Jiang, Xiuli; Shan, Aijing; Nan, Jingminjie; Lei, Ying; Ji, He; Di, Wei; Yang, Tianxiao; Wang, Tiange; Wang, Weiqing; Ning, Guang; Cao, Yanan",Metabolism: clinical and experimental,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916152/,12

METHODS A literature review was conducted using Pubmed, Medline and Ovid for ""hydronephrosis"" and associated terms and we included all studies with at least 2 groups being compared. FI was calculated by populating study results into a two-by-two contingency table and generating a p-value using Fisher's exact test. Next, events were manually added to the group with the fewest events, while removing a non-event from the same group and Fisher's exact test repeated until the p-value was >0.05. FQ was calculated by dividing FI by the total sample size. RESULTS The 130 included articles were published between 1986-2018 in 32 journals. Median citation count was 14(0-252), 30% were RCTs and most papers originated in the United States(28%), Turkey(10%) and Canada(9%). Median FI was 2(1-112], FQ was0.023 (0.0010-0.55) and 60 papers(46%) had a fragility index of 1, indicating extremely fragile results. There was a significant difference in the FI between observational studies and RCTs(10±17 vs. 4±5; p=0.02); however, there was no difference in FQ(0.032± 0.030 vs. 0.053±0.080; p=0.09) between them. CONCLUSION Nearly half of studies in HN literature reporting significant results are extremely fragile, requiring addition of only a couple of events in one treatment arm to significantly modify the results. As such, objective reporting of robustness of results should include FI and FQ which may help diminish over-reliance on p-values as the main indicator of clinical significance in comparative studies.","Rickard, Mandy; Lorenzo, Armando J; Hannick, Jessica H; Blais, Anne-Sophie; Koyle, Martin A; Bägli, Darius J",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2019.03.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374290/,12
123276,In This Issue.,2016,"Objective: We sought to determine if Emergency Medical Services (EMS) identified Persons Under Investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 are associated with hospitalizations for COVID-19 disease for the purposes of serving as a potential early indicator of hospital surge. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the Maryland statewide EMS electronic medical records and daily COVID-19 hospitalizations from March 13, 2020 through July 31, 2020. All unique EMS patients who were identified as COVID-19 PUIs during the study period were included. Descriptive analysis was performed. The Box-Jenkins approach was used to evaluate the relationship between EMS transports and daily new hospitalizations. Separate Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were constructed to transform the data into a series of independent, identically distributed random variables. Fit was measured using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The Box-Ljung white noise test was utilized to ensure there was no autocorrelation in the residuals. Results: EMS units in Maryland identified a total of 26,855 COVID-19 PUIs during the 141-day study period. The median patient age was 62 years old, and 19,111 (71.3%) were 50 years and older. 6,886 (25.6%) patients had an abnormal initial pulse oximetry (<92%). A strong degree of correlation was observed between EMS PUI transports and new hospitalizations. The correlation was strongest and significant at a 9-day lag from time of EMS PUI transports to new COVID-19 hospitalizations, with a cross correlation coefficient of 0.26 (P < .01). Conclusions: A strong correlation between EMS PUIs and COVID-19 hospitalizations was noted in this state-wide analysis. These findings demonstrate the potential value of incorporating EMS clinical information into the development of a robust syndromic surveillance system for COVID-19. This correlation has important utility in the development of predictive tools and models that seek to provide indicators of an impending surge on the healthcare system at large.","Levy, Matthew J; Klein, Eili; Chizmar, Timothy P; Pinet Peralta, Luis M; Alemayehu, Teferra; Sidik, Mustafa M; Delbridge, Theodore R",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,https://doi.org/10.1080/10903127.2020.1864074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33320720/,12
123592,CD40-targeted adenoviral cancer vaccines: the long and winding road to the clinic.,2012,"Background - In December 2019 following an outbreak of Novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, it spread rapidly overwhelming the healthcare systems globally. With little knowledge of COVID-19 virus, very few published reports on surgical outcomes; hospitals stopped elective surgery, whilst emergency surgery was offered only after exhausting all conservative treatment modalities. This study presents our experience of outcomes of emergency appendectomies performed during the pandemic. Methods - Prospectively we collected data on 132 patients in peak pandemic period from 1st March to 5th June 2020 and data compared with 206 patients operated in similar period in 2019. Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, pre-operative events, investigations, surgical management, postoperative outcomes and complications were analysed. Results - Demographics and ASA grades of both cohorts were comparable. In study cohort 84.4% and 96.7% in control cohort had laparoscopic appendicectomy. Whilst the study cohort had 13.6% primary open operations, control cohort had 5.3%. Mean length of stay and early post-operative complications (<30 days) were similar in both cohorts apart from surgical site infections (p = 0.02) and one mortality in study cohort. Conclusion - In these overwhelming pandemic times, although conservative treatment of acute appendicitis is an option, a proportion of patients will need surgery. Our study shows that with careful planning and strict theatre protocols, emergency appendicectomy can be safely offered with minimal risk of spreading COVID-19 infection. These observations warrant further prospective randomised studies.

123838,Point of Care Sensors for Infectious Pathogens.,2020-11-20,"BACKGROUND On March 23, 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea. On August 8, the WHO declared the epidemic to be a ""public health emergency of international concern."" METHODS By September 14, 2014, a total of 4507 probable and confirmed cases, including 2296 deaths from EVD (Zaire species) had been reported from five countries in West Africa--Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. We analyzed a detailed subset of data on 3343 confirmed and 667 probable Ebola cases collected in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone as of September 14. RESULTS The majority of patients are 15 to 44 years of age (49.9% male), and we estimate that the case fatality rate is 70.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69 to 73) among persons with known clinical outcome of infection. The course of infection, including signs and symptoms, incubation period (11.4 days), and serial interval (15.3 days), is similar to that reported in previous outbreaks of EVD. On the basis of the initial periods of exponential growth, the estimated basic reproduction numbers (R0 ) are 1.71 (95% CI, 1.44 to 2.01) for Guinea, 1.83 (95% CI, 1.72 to 1.94) for Liberia, and 2.02 (95% CI, 1.79 to 2.26) for Sierra Leone. The estimated current reproduction numbers (R) are 1.81 (95% CI, 1.60 to 2.03) for Guinea, 1.51 (95% CI, 1.41 to 1.60) for Liberia, and 1.38 (95% CI, 1.27 to 1.51) for Sierra Leone; the corresponding doubling times are 15.7 days (95% CI, 12.9 to 20.3) for Guinea, 23.6 days (95% CI, 20.2 to 28.2) for Liberia, and 30.2 days (95% CI, 23.6 to 42.3) for Sierra Leone. Assuming no change in the control measures for this epidemic, by November 2, 2014, the cumulative reported numbers of confirmed and probable cases are predicted to be 5740 in Guinea, 9890 in Liberia, and 5000 in Sierra Leone, exceeding 20,000 in total. CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that without drastic improvements in control measures, the numbers of cases of and deaths from EVD are expected to continue increasing from hundreds to thousands per week in the coming months.","Aylward, Bruce; Barboza, Philippe; Bawo, Luke; Bertherat, Eric; Bilivogui, Pepe; Blake, Isobel; Brennan, Rick; Briand, Sylvie; Chakauya, Jethro Magwati; Chitala, Kennedy; Conteh, Roland M; Cori, Anne; Croisier, Alice; Dangou, Jean-Marie; Diallo, Boubacar; Donnelly, Christl A; Dye, Christopher; Eckmanns, Tim; Ferguson, Neil M; Formenty, Pierre; Fuhrer, Caroline; Fukuda, Keiji; Garske, Tini; Gasasira, Alex; Gbanyan, Stephen; Graaff, Peter; Heleze, Emmanuel; Jambai, Amara; Jombart, Thibaut; Kasolo, Francis; Kadiobo, Albert Mbule; Keita, Sakoba; Kertesz, Daniel; Koné, Moussa; Lane, Chris; Markoff, Jered; Massaquoi, Moses; Mills, Harriet; Mulba, John Mike; Musa, Emmanuel; Myhre, Joel; Nasidi, Abdusalam; Nilles, Eric; Nouvellet, Pierre; Nshimirimana, Deo; Nuttall, Isabelle; Nyenswah, Tolbert; Olu, Olushayo; Pendergast, Scott; Perea, William; Polonsky, Jonathan; Riley, Steven; Ronveaux, Olivier; Sakoba, Keita; Santhana Gopala Krishnan, Ravi; Senga, Mikiko; Shuaib, Faisal; Van Kerkhove, Maria D; Vaz, Rui; Wijekoon Kannangarage, Niluka; Yoti, Zabulon",The New England journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa1411100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25244186/,12

A total of 105 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to three groups: 68% hepatectomy (the PH group), portal arterialization after 68% hepatectomy (the PVA group), and right nephrectomy only (the control group). Liver regeneration rate (LRR), 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling index, and liver functions were assessed on postoperative day 2, 7, 14 and 28. The 28-day survival rates were compared among the three groups. The 28-day survival rates were similar in all groups (P = 0.331), and the anastomotic patency was 100%. The LRR in the PVA group was significantly higher than that of the PH group within postoperative 14 days (P < 0.05). The PVA and PH group had increased serum alanine aminotransferase levels (232 ± 61 U/L and 212 ± 53 U/L, respectively) compared with the control group (101 ± 13 U/L) on postoperative day 2, whereas from postoperative day 7 to day 28 there were no differences among the three groups. Serum albumin values were higher after the PVA procedure within postoperative day 14, which gradually became comparable on postoperative day 28 among the three groups. The peaks of BrdU labeling index appeared on postoperative day 2 in all rats, and the PVA procedure was associated with increased BrdU labeling index from postoperative day 7 to 28. The 28-day survival of the PVA rats was comparable. Our findings demonstrate that the PVA procedure utilizing portal vein trunk-renal artery microvascular reconstruction promotes remnant liver regeneration and confers beneficial effects on maintaining and even optimizing liver function after extended partial hepatectomy in rats.","Li, Jian; Cai, Chaonong; Guo, Hui; Guan, Xiaodong; Yang, Lukun; Li, Yuechan; Zhu, Yanhua; Li, Peiping; Liu, Xialei; Zhang, Baimeng",Journal of biomedical research,https://doi.org/10.7555/jbr.29.20140054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25745478/,12

Influential neurodevelopmental theories suggest that alterations in the function of limbic and frontal regions render youth susceptible to these deficits. However, whether depression and substance use in youth are associated with similar alterations in emotion regulation neural circuitry is unknown. In this systematic review we synthesized the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating the neural correlates of emotion regulation in youth depression and substance use. Resting-state fMRI studies focusing on limbic connectivity were also reviewed. While findings were largely inconsistent within and between studies of depression and substance use, some patterns emerged. First, youth depression appears to be associated with exaggerated amygdala activity in response to negative stimuli; second, both depression and substance use appear to be associated with lower functional connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex during rest. Findings are discussed in relation to support for existing neurodevelopmental models, and avenues for future work are suggested, including studying neurodevelopmental trajectories from a network perspective.","Rakesh, Divyangana; Allen, Nicholas B; Whittle, Sarah",Developmental cognitive neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2020.100775; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32452461/,12

Prior health economic analyses estimated incremental net benefits of the GPEI of 40-50 billion in 2008 U.S. dollars (US$2008, equivalent to 48-59 billion US$2019), assuming the achievement of polio eradication by 2012. Given the delays in achieving polio eradication and increased costs, we performed an updated economic analysis of the GPEI using an updated integrated global model, and considering the GPEI trajectory as of the beginning of 2020. Applying similar methods and assuming eradication achievement in 2023, we estimate incremental net benefits of the GPEI of 28 billion US$2019, which falls below the prior estimate. Delays in achieving polio eradication combined with the widescale introduction of relatively expensive inactivated poliovirus vaccine significantly increased the costs of the GPEI and make it less cost-effective, although the GPEI continues to yield expected incremental net benefits at the global level when considered over the time horizon of 1988-2029. The overall health and financial benefits of the GPEI will depend on whether and when the GPEI can achieve its goals, when eradication occurs, the valuation method applied, and the path dependence of the actions taken. Reduced expected incremental net benefits of the GPEI and the substantial economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic pose large financial risks for the GPEI.","Thompson, Kimberly M; Kalkowska, Dominika A",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.13665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33590521/,12

This project sought to systematically compare outcomes of EEA management with conventional transcranial approach (TCA) for the treatment of OGMs. A systematic review was performed to identify studies that compared outcomes following EEA and TCA for OGMs. Data extracted from each study included gross total resection (GTR), incidence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, and post-operative complications including anosmia. The results of the search yielded 5 studies which met the criteria for inclusion and analysis. All studies compared TCA (n = 922) with EEA (n = 141) outcomes for OGMs. Overall, the rate of gross total resection (GTR) was lower among the endoscopic group (70.9%) relative to the transcranial group (91.5%). The rate of post-operative CSF leak was 6.3% vs. 25.5% for the transcranial and endoscopic groups, respectively. Post-operative anosmia was higher for patients undergoing EEA (95.9%) compared with patients in the transcranial group (37.4%). In this analysis, EEA was associated with a lower rate of GTR and higher incidences of CSF leaks and post-operative anosmia. However, with increasing surgeon familiarity of the endoscopic anatomy and technique for managing ASB pathologies, a nuanced approach may be used to minimize patient morbidity and widen the spectrum of skull base surgery.","Purohit, Aarti; Jha, Roshani; Khalafallah, Adham M; Price, Carrie; Rowan, Nicholas R; Mukherjee, Debraj",Neurosurgical review,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10143-019-01193-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31709465/,12

Around the globe, a total of 71429 were infected up to February 17, 2020, with 98.9% of cases in China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the COVID-19 as 'pandemic'. Rapid positive worldwide incidence was the motivation behind this study to investigate the incidence and mortality globally. METHODS We used the data published by the WHO until March 9, 2020. Non-parametric tests and change point analysis were used for inferences. RESULTS Change point analysis for Iran and China and the world excluding China for the first 20 days revealed around 78, 195 and 2 further new cases per day, respectively. Italy had a big jump in incidence on the 36th day. Similarly, a sharp rise of positive cases was reported for the world on the 35th day. China successfully controlled the ascending reports of incidence on the 23rd day. Mortality in China and the world were almost similar for the first 20 days. There was an ascending incidence trend with two change points in Italy (30th and 36th days) and one change point in Iran on the 17th day. Mortality in the world jumped remarkably after day 42 with an estimation of almost more than 25 deaths per day. CONCLUSION The incidence of COVID-19 varied by regions; however, after March 11, it became 'pandemic'. It was observed that after about 6 days with an emergence of sharp increase in incidences, there would be a mutation in mortality rate. On the other hand, the importance of 'on-time' quarantine programs in controlling this virus was confirmed.","Chaibakhsh, Samira; Pourhoseingholi, Asma; Vahedi, Mohsen",Archives of Iranian medicine,https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2020.42; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32657596/,12
126380,Effect of different dental articulating papers on SEMG activity during maximum clenching.,2015,"Background: Indole tryptophan metabolites (ITMs), mainly produced at the gastrointestinal level, participate in bidirectional gut-brain communication and have been implicated in neuropsychiatric pathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method: A total of 179 children, 5-14 years of age, including a healthy control group (CG, n = 49), and 107 patients with ADHD participated in the study. The ADHD group was further subdivided into predominantly attention deficit (PAD) and predominantly hyperactive impulsive (PHI) subgroups. Blood samples were drawn at 20:00 and 09:00 hours, and urine was collected between blood draws, at baseline and after 4.63 ± 2.3 months of methylphenidate treatment in the ADHD group. Levels and daily fluctuations of ITM were measured by tandem mass spectrometer, and S100B (as a glial inflammatory marker) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Factorial analysis of variance (Stata 12.0) was performed with groups/subgroups, time (baseline/after treatment), hour of day (morning/evening), and presence of depressive symptoms (DS; no/yes) as factors. Results: Tryptamine and indoleacetic acid (IAA) showed no differences between the CG and ADHD groups. Tryptamine exhibited higher evening values (p < 0.0001) in both groups. No changes were associated with methylphenidate or DS. At baseline, in comparison with the rest of study sample, PHI with DS+ group showed among them much greater morning than evening IAA (p < 0.0001), with treatment causing a 50% decrease (p = 0.002). Concerning indolepropionic acid (IPA) MPH was associated with a morning IPA decrease and restored the daily profile observed in the CG. S100B protein showed greater morning than evening concentrations (p = 0.001) in both groups. Conclusion: Variations in ITM may reflect changes associated with the presence of DS, including improvement, among ADHD patients.","Fernández-López, Luisa; Molina-Carballo, Antonio; Cubero-Millán, Isabel; Checa-Ros, Ana; Machado-Casas, Irene; Blanca-Jover, Enrique; Jerez-Calero, Antonio; Madrid-Fernández, Yolanda; Uberos, José; Muñoz-Hoyos, Antonio",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1089/cap.2019.0072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32048862/,12

Inefficient clearance of respiratory secretions provokes NPPV failure in patients with hypercapnic encephalopathy (HE). This study compared CMV and NPPV combined with a noninvasive strategy for clearing secretions in HE and AECOPD patients.The present study is a prospective cohort study of AECOPD and HE patients enrolled between October 2013 and August 2015 in a critical care unit of a major university teaching hospital in China.A total of 74 patients received NPPV and 90 patients received CMV. Inclusion criteria included the following: physician-diagnosed AECOPD, spontaneous airway clearance of excessive secretions, arterial blood gas analysis requiring intensive care, moderate-to-severe dyspnea, and a Kelly-Matthay scale score of 3 to 5. Exclusion criteria included the following: preexisting psychiatric/neurological disorders unrelated to HE, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, upper airway obstruction, acute coronary syndromes, preadmission tracheostomy or endotracheal intubation, and urgent endotracheal intubation for cardiovascular, psychomotor agitation, or severe hemodynamic conditions.Intensive care unit participants were managed by NPPV. Participants received standard treatment consisting of controlled oxygen therapy during NPPV-free periods; antibiotics, intravenous doxofylline, corticosteroids (e.g., salbutamol and ambroxol), and subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin; and therapy for comorbidities if necessary. Nasogastric tubes were inserted only in participants who developed gastric distension. No pharmacological sedation was administered.The primary and secondary outcome measures included comparative complication rates, durations of ventilation and hospitalization, number of invasive devices/patient, and in-hospital and 1-year mortality rates.Arterial blood gases and sensorium levels improved significantly within 2 hours in the NPPV group with lower hospital mortality, fewer complications and invasive devices/patient, and superior weaning off mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation duration, hospital stay, or 1-year mortality was similar between groups.NPPV combined with a noninvasive strategy to clear secretions during the first 2 hours may offer advantages over CMV in treating AECOPD patients complicated by HE.","Wang, Jinrong; Cui, Zhaobo; Liu, Shuhong; Gao, Xiuling; Gao, Pan; Shi, Yi; Guo, Shufen; Li, Peipei",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000006371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28328824/,12
126747,The Amyloid-beta rich CNS environment alters myeloid cell functionality independent of their origin.,2020-04-28,"INTRODUCTION The use of a system for continuous control of endotracheal tube cuff pressure reduced the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in one randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 112 patients but not in another RCT with 142 patients. In several guidelines on the prevention of VAP, the use of a system for continuous or intermittent control of endotracheal cuff pressure is not reviewed. The objective of this study was to compare the incidence of VAP in a large sample of patients (n = 284) treated with either continuous or intermittent control of endotracheal tube cuff pressure. METHODS We performed a prospective observational study of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation during more than 48 hours in an intensive care unit (ICU) using either continuous or intermittent endotracheal tube cuff pressure control. Multivariate logistic regression analysis (MLRA) and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis were used to predict VAP. The magnitude of the effect was expressed as odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR), respectively, and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS We found a lower incidence of VAP with the continuous (n = 150) than with the intermittent (n = 134) pressure control system (22.0% versus 11.2%; p = 0.02). MLRA showed that the continuous pressure control system (OR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.22-0.89; p = 0.02) and the use of an endotracheal tube incorporating a lumen for subglottic secretion drainage (SSD) (OR = 0.39; 95% CI = 0.19-0.84; p = 0.02) were protective factors against VAP. Cox regression analysis showed that the continuous pressure control system (HR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.24-0.84; p = 0.01) and the use of an endotracheal tube incorporating a lumen for SSD (HR = 0.29; 95% CI = 0.15-0.56; p < 0.001) were protective factors against VAP. However, the interaction between type of endotracheal cuff pressure control system (continuous or intermittent) and endotracheal tube (with or without SSD) was not statistically significant in MLRA (OR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.07-2.37; p = 0.32) or in Cox analysis (HR = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.06-1.84; p = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS The use of a continuous endotracheal cuff pressure control system and/or an endotracheal tube with a lumen for SSD could help to prevent VAP in patients requiring more than 48 hours of mechanical ventilation.","Lorente, Leonardo; Lecuona, María; Jiménez, Alejandro; Lorenzo, Lisset; Roca, Isabel; Cabrera, Judith; Llanos, Celina; Mora, María L",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/cc13837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751286/,12
127648,Sestrin2 regulates microglia polarization through mTOR-mediated autophagic flux to attenuate inflammation during experimental brain ischemia.,2020-11-05,"Sepsis is a serious medical condition in which immune dysfunction plays a key role. Previous treatments focused on chemotherapy to control immune function; however, a recognized effective compound or treatment has yet to be developed. Recent advances indicate that a neuromodulation approach with nerve stimulation allows developing a therapeutic strategy to control inflammation and improve organ functions in sepsis. As a quick, non-invasive technique of peripheral nerve stimulation, acupuncture has emerged as a promising therapy to provide significant advantages for immunomodulation in acute inflammation. Acupuncture obtains its regulatory effect by activating the somatic-autonomic-immune reflexes, including the somatic-sympathetic-splenic reflex, the somatic-sympathetic-adrenal reflex, the somatic-vagal-splenic reflex and the somatic-vagal-adrenal reflex, which produces a systemic effect. The peripheral nerve stimulation also induces local reflexes such as the somatic-sympathetic-lung-reflex, which then produces local effects. These mechanisms offer scientific guidance to design acupuncture protocols for immunomodulation and inflammation control, leading to an evidence-based comprehensive therapy recommendation.","Pan, Wei-Xing; Fan, Arthur Yin; Chen, Shaozong; Alemi, Sarah Faggert",Autonomic neuroscience : basic & clinical,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autneu.2021.102793; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33684727/,12

128925,Beyond the VA Crisis--Becoming a High-Performance Network.,2016,"OBJECTIVE To inform the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, we conducted a systematic literature review of case reports of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, during pregnancy and summarized clinical presentation, course of illness, and pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. DATA SOURCES We searched MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to April 23, 2020. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION We included articles reporting case-level data on MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women. Course of illness, indicators of severe illness, maternal health outcomes, and pregnancy outcomes were abstracted from included articles. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS We identified 1,328 unique articles, and 1,253 articles were excluded by title and abstract review. We completed full-text review on 75, and 29 articles were excluded by full-text review. Among 46 publications reporting case-level data, eight described 12 cases of MERS-CoV infection, seven described 17 cases of SARS-CoV infection, and 31 described 98 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical presentation and course of illness ranged from asymptomatic to severe fatal disease, similar to the general population of patients. Severe morbidity and mortality among women with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, or SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, and laboratory evidence of vertical transmission, were reported. CONCLUSION Understanding whether pregnant women may be at risk for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes from severe coronavirus infections is imperative. Data from case reports of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SAR-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy are limited, but they may guide early public health actions and clinical decision-making for COVID-19 until more rigorous and systematically collected data are available. The capture of critical data is needed to better define how this infection affects pregnant women and neonates.

Implementation of lockdown and limited outdoor activities resulted in changes in routines of children with diabetes. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of lockdown on glycemic control, weight and body mass index (BMI) patterns of children with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) from different socio-economic (SE) classes. Methods This observational study included 77 children and youth (5-20 years) with T1DM having disease duration of ≥6 months. Demographic data and investigations were recorded at two time points (post lockdown when the children came for follow up, pre lockdown data from medical records). Results Glycemic control improved (pre lockdown HbA1C 79.4±19.2 vs. post lockdown Hba1C 74.5±16.9 mmol/mol, p<0.05) and there was weight gain post lockdown (pre lockdown weight z-score -0.4±0.8 vs. post lockdown weight z-score -0.2±0.8, p<0.05) without any significant change in BMI and insulin requirements. Improved glycemic was seen in the lower SE group control post lockdown (p<0.05), whereas in higher SE group, it remained unchanged. Children whose parents were at home during lockdown showed an improved glycemic control (p<0.05) as compared to children whose parents continued to work during lockdown (p>0.01) Conclusions During coronavirus lockdown, glycemic control was adequately maintained in children with T1DM, highlighting importance of stronger family support system leading to more steady daily routine.","Shah, Nikhil; Karguppikar, Madhura; Bhor, Shital; Ladkat, Dipali; Khadilkar, Vaman; Khadilkar, Anuradha",Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,https://doi.org/10.1515/jpem-2020-0460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33185578/,12
130799,"Probiotic effects on sperm parameters, oxidative stress index, inflammatory factors and sex hormones in infertile men.",2020-09-27,"BACKGROUND Lymph node dissection is often performed as a part of surgical treatment for breast cancer and malignant melanoma to prevent malignant cells from traveling via the lymphatic system. Currently little is known about postoperative lymphatic drainage pattern alterations. This knowledge may be useful for management of recurrent cancer and prevention of breast cancer related lymphedema. We mapped the complete superficial lymphatic system of a dog and used this canine model to perform preliminary studies of lymphatic architectural changes in postoperative condition. METHODS Lymphatic territories (lymphosomes) were mapped with 4 female mongrel carcasses using an indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent lymphography and a radiographic microinjection technique. Two live dogs were then subjected to unilateral lymph node dissection of lymph basins of the forelimb, and ICG lymphography and lymphangiogram were performed 6 months after the surgery to investigate lymphatic changes. Lymphatic patterns in the carcass were then compared with postoperative lymphatic patterns in the live dogs. RESULTS Ten lymphosomes were identified, corresponding with ten lymphatic basins. Postoperative fluorescent lymphographic images and lymphangiograms in the live dogs revealed small caliber lymphatic network fulfilling gaps in the surgical area and collateral lymphatic vessels arising from the network connecting to lymph nodes in the contralateral and ipsilateral neck in one dog and the ipsilateral subclavicular vein in another dog. CONCLUSION Our canine lymphosome map allowed us to observe lymphatic collateral formations after lymph node dissection in live dogs. This canine model may help clarify our understanding of postoperative lymphatic changes in humans in future studies.","Suami, Hiroo; Yamashita, Shuji; Soto-Miranda, Miguel A; Chang, David W",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23894435/,12

However, data substantiating its effectiveness and safety are limited. This study evaluated effectiveness and safety of the Veterans Affairs (VA) national HBCR program. METHODS Veterans completed a 12-wk HBCR program over 18 mo at 25 geographically dispersed VA hospitals. Pre- to post-changes were compared using paired t tests. Patient satisfaction and adverse events were also summarized descriptively. RESULTS Of the 923 Veterans with a mean age of 67.3 ± 10.6 yr enrolled in the HBCR program, 572 (62%) completed it. Findings included significant improvements in exercise capacity (6-min walk test distance: 355 vs 398 m; P < .05; Duke Activity Status Index: 27.1 vs 33.5; P < .05; self-reported steps/d: 3150 vs 4166; P < .05); depression measured by Patient Health Questionnaire (6.4 vs 4.9; P < .0001); cardiac self-efficacy (33.1 vs 39.2; P < .0001); body mass index (31.5 vs 31.1 kg/m2; P = .0001); and eating habits measured by Rate Your Plate, Heart (47.2 vs 51.1; P < .05). No safety issues were related to HBCR participation. Participants were highly satisfied. CONCLUSIONS The VA HBCR program demonstrates strong evidence of effectiveness and safety to a wide range of patients, including those with high clinical complexity and risk. HBCR provides an adjunct to site-based programs and access to cardiac rehabilitation. Additional research is needed to assess long-term effects, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of the model.","Drwal, Kariann R; Wakefield, Bonnie J; Forman, Daniel E; Wu, Wen-Chih; Haraldsson, Bjarni; El Accaoui, Ramzi N",Journal of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation and prevention,https://doi.org/10.1097/hcr.0000000000000594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33647921/,12

METHODS This was a prospective, observational, randomized, clinical study carried out at a university teaching hospital. Twenty healthy, client-owned cats were used. Each cat had blood collected via direct venipuncture from both jugular veins. Sampling of the right and left jugular vein was randomized to be collected with either a 22 G or a 25 G needle, respectively, and routine coagulation variables and platelet count were performed on all samples. Values were analyzed for differences in needle size, and site of sample collection. RESULTS There was no difference between the two needle gauges in activated partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, fibrinogen degradation products, or fibrinogen, or between sampling from the left and right jugular vein. Prothrombin time (PT) was significantly higher when drawn from a 25 G needle (11.7 s) compared with a 22 G needle (11.4 s) ( P = 0.01), but not different in left vs right jugular vein samples. Bland-Altman analysis of PT comparing for 25 G minus 22 G needle vs the average, calculated a mean bias (95% limits of agreement) of 0.49 s (-1.4 s to 2.4 s). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study of 20 healthy cats found that the use of either a 25 G or 22 G needle for jugular venipuncture did not introduce any clinically meaningful difference in routine coagulation variables or platelet count.","Solbak, Susanna; Epstein, Steven E; Hopper, Kate",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x18766154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29741463/,12
131565,Self-replicating alphavirus RNA vaccines.,2015,"GOAL To evaluate a novel kind of textile electrodes based on woven fabrics treated with PEDOT PSS, through an easy fabrication process, testing these electrodes for biopotential recordings. METHODS Fabrication is based on raw fabric soaking in PEDOT PSS using a second dopant, squeezing and annealing. The electrodes have been tested on human volunteers, in terms of both skin contact impedance and quality of the ECG signals recorded at rest and during physical activity (power spectral density, baseline wandering, QRS detectability, and broadband noise). RESULTS The electrodes are able to operate in both wet and dry conditions. Dry electrodes are more prone to noise artifacts, especially during physical exercise and mainly due to the unstable contact between the electrode and the skin. Wet (saline) electrodes present a stable and reproducible behavior, which is comparable or better than that of traditional disposable gelled Ag/AgCl electrodes. CONCLUSION The achieved results reveal the capability of this kind of electrodes to work without the electrolyte, providing a valuable interface with the skin, due to mixed electronic and ionic conductivity of PEDOT PSS. These electrodes can be effectively used for acquiring ECG signals. SIGNIFICANCE Textile electrodes based on PEDOT PSS represent an important milestone in wearable monitoring, as they present an easy and reproducible fabrication process, very good performance in wet and dry (at rest) conditions and a superior level of comfort with respect to textile electrodes proposed so far. This paves the way to their integration into smart garments.","Pani, Danilo; Dessi, Alessia; Saenz-Cogollo, Jose F; Barabino, Gianluca; Fraboni, Beatrice; Bonfiglio, Annalisa",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2015.2465936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26259215/,12

We report our experience of RFA in the treatment of metastases in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with osteosarcoma. PROCEDURE Sixteen patients treated for osteosarcoma in French Society of Childhood Cancer centers had undergone an RFA procedure between 2006 and 2012. RESULTS Thirteen sessions were performed in 10 patients to treat 22 lung metastases. Seven patients were in complete remission at last follow up (range 19-51 months; median, 24 months after RFA). None had a recurrence at RFA sites. We report three cases each of hemoptysis and pneumothorax. Eight sessions were performed in seven patients to treat bone lesions. PROCEDURE was intended as: curative for a small metastatic lesion (n = 3, all in remission more than 3 years after); local control of small bone lesions in multi-metastatic diseases (n = 3); analgesia (n = 1). Complications included one first-degree burn, one fracture, and one soft tissue infection. CONCLUSIONS RFA is feasible in AYA with osteosarcoma. It efficiently achieved local control of small peripheral lung metastases.

The goal of this study was to present the largest series, with the longest follow-up, of patients with Zenker's diverticulum receiving outpatient treatment with flexible endoscopy using a diverticuloscope and Ligasure (Covidien, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States), a device that allows tissue sealing and coagulation of vessels before cutting the septum between the diverticulum and esophagus. Patients and methods We performed 79 diverticulotomies in 69 patients (65.2 % male, mean age 73.4 years). The mean diverticulum size was 2.8 cm. In three cases with a diverticulum ≤ 1.5 cm, the diverticuloscope could not be placed. Results The technical success was 95.83 % and the clinical success 96.7 %: 84 % of the 56 patients followed for a mean of 34.6 months (24 - 64 months) had no dysphagia. The recurrence rate was 10.4 %, with a good response to a second diverticulotomy at 12 months (IQR: 11.5 - 17) in most cases.

Conclusions Diverticulotomy of the esophageal-diverticular septum with Ligasure is an outpatient endoscopic technique that is simple, effective in the long term and very safe for the treatment of patients with Zenker's diverticulum. In symptomatic recurrences, a second procedure was equally safe and effective in most patients.","Diez Redondo, Pilar; Núñez Rodríguez, Henar; de Benito Sanz, Marina; Torres Yuste, Raúl; Pérez-Miranda, Manuel",Endoscopy international open,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-0809-4875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705954/,12

A review of Freud's writings beginning with the Project indicates that from the perspective of the impact upon psychic processes, Freud held a more consistent view of the concept that, if recognized, can help avoid the often fruitless etiological debates of internal vs. external cause, intrinsic (drive) vs. extrinsic (reality) factors, etc. What is more helpful from a clinical perspective, is to view the various challenges that a given set of potentially trauma-inducing circumstances might pose for an individual, consider each individual's highly subjective mode of experiencing and responding to those challenges and take into account the supports offered in any instance by the specific familial, social or cultural surround. Each set of experiences that will be qualified as 'trauma' that any of us undergoes will to some extent be understood and integrated into our particular subjectivities according to our unique, subjective organizations of self, understandings of and position in the world.","Levine, Howard B",The International journal of psycho-analysis,https://doi.org/10.1080/00207578.2020.1841923; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34357847/,12

A recent case report in this journal found that a COVID-19 diagnosis has been made from the serological results despite first CT scan and RT-PCR negative results. We have included 311 consecutive patients with COVID-19-like symptoms who underwent a RT-PCR test on nasopharyngeal swab samples and a chest CT scan. Patients with a positive chest scan and a negative RT-PCR were screened for serum total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 2 months after the onset of symptoms using the Wantai test in order to arbitrate between RT-PCR and CT scans discordant results. Most of the RT-PCR and chest CT results agreed but the serological tests indicate that most CT positive/NAT negative patients are not infected by SARS-CoV-2 and alternative diagnoses should be seriously considered.

132348,Robotic approaches to prolapse surgery.,2012,"OBJECTIVE Design, develop and trial an intravaginal device able to remain within the bovine vagina for up to 6 months, accommodating various technologies, while not adversely affecting the cow, or pregnancy. METHODS Device scoping required minimal interference with vaginal drainage, no constant pressure on any single point of the vaginal mucosa and minimal footprint on the vaginal floor. A polycarbonate prototype was developed consisting of a central cargo space to house sensors and battery, with a separate retention module. Mathematical modelling informed the required length and flexibility of the arms on the retention module to reduce pressure necrosis and inflammation within the vagina. The prototype was initially trialled, with a loaded cargo pod, for 4 weeks in five non-pregnant cows. Cows were monitored for signs of systemic infection and inflammation by collecting blood samples for haematology and acute phase inflammatory proteins. Cows were also assessed for general demeanour, signs of discomfort and positioning of the device. Later, the device was inserted into 20 early pregnant cows, with 20 contemporary, untreated controls. Cows were monitored, as in the initial trial, every 4 weeks for the next 5 to 6 months until calving. RESULTS In Trial 1, there was 100% retention with no adverse effects. In Trial 2, device retention was 75% until calving with no adverse effects on cow health or pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS We describe the longest successful deployment of an intravaginal device in pregnant and non-pregnant cattle, with long-term retention, no adverse effects and 28 cm3 of cargo space.","Stephen, C P; Norman, S T",Australian veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/avj.13076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954984/,12
132378,"Substrate-Dependent Modulation of SIRT2 by a Fluorescent Probe, 1-Aminoanthracene.",2020-09-17,"Public health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic are leading many residency and fellowship programs to transition from in-person to videoconference interviews (VCIs). The magnitude and speed of the shift to VCIs, the lack of existing research around bias and VCIs, and the underlying stress on all involved related to the pandemic put programs at risk of implementing virtual interviews without fully exploring their implications for diversity and equity. VCIs can promote diversity efforts by reducing the need for travel, making interviews more convenient and cost-effective for applicants. However, VCIs may also introduce new biases and amplify existing biases in recruitment. VCIs introduce a dependence on technology to conduct the interview process, which may amplify systemic inequities in access to broadband internet and high-quality hardware. Communication delays due to technology challenges may negatively affect interview scores. Additionally, users experience increased cognitive load when participating in videoconferences, which can activate implicit biases. Exposure to cues in the interviewee's personal living situation previously unavailable to interviewers may lead to unconscious assumptions by interviewers, which may also influence scoring. Graduate medical education programs committed to maintaining equitable recruitment processes must be able to recognize potential biases in VCIs and implement strategies to mitigate them. This article identifies some of the biases VCIs can introduce to the recruitment process and offers strategies for programs to mitigate them. These include making interviewers aware of potential technology-based inequities, encouraging interviewers to minimize multi-tasking, and offering guidance on use of standardized backgrounds. The authors also recognize the limitations of offering behavioral strategies to mitigate systemic inequities and suggest that structural changes are needed to ensure equitable access to technology.","Marbin, Jyothi; Hutchinson, Y-Vonne; Schaeffer, Sarah",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33464743/,12

It is an important enzyme in medicine and industry. Some pathogen bacteria use this exoenzyme to disrupt the extracellular matrix of host organisms. Pseudomonas uses various extracellular enzymes such as lipase to invade its host. In this report, for the first time, bromhexine was introduced as an inhibitor of lipase. Bromhexine is a mucolytic drug which is used in the treatment of respiratory tract disorders. The results showed that bromhexine inhibited the enzyme by competitive inhibition. IC50 and Ki values of the drug were 0.049 mM and 0.02 mM, respectively. Arrhenius plot showed that the drug reduced the activation energy. The enzyme was purified and SDS-PAGE showed that its molecular weight is 13 kDa. Fluorescence measurement revealed that binding of the drug to lipase could make structural changes in the enzyme. Inhibition of lipase by bromhexine could be applicable in medicine.","Gholami, Asma; Minai-Tehrani, Dariush; Eftekhar, Fereshteh",Archives of physiology and biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1080/13813455.2020.1788606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633559/,12

METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of 225 patients who had received intravenous-rt-PA for anterior circulation strokes. The occlusion-site was prospectively determined on the admission computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and divided into: large vessel occlusion (LVO) including patients with an internal carotid artery terminus or middle cerebral artery (M1/proximal M2) occlusions and no large vessel occlusion (No-LVO; distal M2/M3/ACA) including patients with either distal or no occlusions. The primary outcome was the modified Rankin score (mRS) at 90-days with a good outcome defined by mRS of 0-2.000. RESULTS There were 114 (50.7%) patients in the LVO and 111 (49.3%) in the No-LVO group. A good outcome was seen in 28 (24.6%) patients in the LVO and 77 (69.4%) patients in the No-LVO group (OR .14; 95% CI: .08-.26; P < .0001). Mortality was observed in 13 (11.7%) patients in the No-LVO group and 48 (42.1%) patients in the LVO group (OR .18; 95% CI: .09-.36; P < .0001). Significant hemorrhage was seen in 14 (12.5%) patients in the LVO and 0 (0%) patients in the No-LVO group (P < .0001).

Cytological evaluation of otic exudate is a useful diagnostic test to direct and monitor treatment for otitis externa. One method of collecting ear cytological specimens utilizes a cotton-tipped swab inserted into the vertical ear canal. A proposed alternative method is to aspirate exudate from the deep horizontal canal using a rubber tube. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES To compare cytological findings between two different collection techniques by evaluating the numbers of bacteria, Malassezia yeast and inflammatory cells. ANIMALS Thirty client-owned dogs with otitis externa. METHODS AND MATERIALS A prospective, randomized, blinded comparison study. Ear canals from each dog were sampled using cotton swab and rubber tube. Ear cytological preparations were evaluated independently by two investigators for polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN), monocytes/lymphocytes, macrophages, yeast, intracellular (IC) cocci, extracellular (EC) cocci, IC bacilli and EC bacilli. RESULTS A paired Student's t-test was used to compare the two techniques. The inter-investigator reliability for PMN, EC bacilli and yeast was good, and for EC cocci was moderate. There were significantly higher numbers of PMNs obtained by the tube method (P = 0.0024) than by the cotton swab method. There were no statistically significant differences between cotton swab and rubber tube methods for monocytes/lymphocytes (P = 0.7780), macrophages (P = 0.1751), EC cocci (P = 0.1262), EC bacilli (P = 0.1162), yeast (P = 0.5371), IC cocci (P = 0.6606) or IC bacilli (P = 0.6761). The technique was well tolerated. CONCLUSION An alternative ear cytological collection technique was identified which enables sampling of the deep horizontal canal.","Choi, Nellie; Edginton, Heather D; Griffin, Craig E; Angus, John C",Veterinary dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/vde.12664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30109742/,12

DESIGN The study used a cross-sectional survey design for audiologists across the globe (n = 337) using an online survey (June-August 2020) focussing on changes to the workplace during the pandemic. RESULTS Participants represented varied work settings and audiology services. Only a third (31.5%) provided psychosocial support, which may be important during the pandemic, as part of their services. Almost all (97%) audiologists reported changes to their workplace, with 76.4% reporting reduced caseloads during the COVID-19 pandemic. When rating their current and anticipated work conditions, 38.7% reported reduced working hours although only 13.8% anticipated reduced working hours in 6-months' time. Audiologists ranked services such as access to hearing assessment, hearing device adjustment and maintenance, and general audiological support as being more important during the pandemic than services such as psychosocial, emotional and tinnitus support. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruptions to audiological practice that highlights the need to adapt and incorporate new audiological practices including telehealth, to ensure patients have continued access to care and clinics remain sustainable during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recovery phase.","Manchaiah, Vinaya; Eikelboom, Robert H; Bennett, Rebecca J; Swanepoel, De Wet",International journal of audiology,https://doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2021.1937348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34137644/,12

The risk of liver disease from the combination of these factors is unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to address this important gap in evidence. Protocol registered with PROSPERO(CRD42016046508). METHODS We performed electronic searches of Ovid Medline, Embase Classic + Embase, until 17th June 2020 for cohort studies of adults without pre-existing liver disease. Primary outcome was morbidity/mortality from chronic liver disease. Exposures were alcohol consumption categorised as within or above UK recommended limits (14 units/112g per week) and BMI categorised as normal, overweight or obese. Non-drinkers were excluded. A Poisson regression log-linear model was used to test for statistical interaction between alcohol and BMI and to conduct a one-stage meta-analysis. RESULTS Searches identified 3,129 studies - 16 were eligible. Of these, nine cohorts (1,121,514 participants) had data available and were included in the analysis. The Poisson model showed no significant statistical interaction between alcohol consumption and BMI on risk of chronic liver disease. Compared to normal weight participants drinking alcohol within UK recommended limits, relative risk of chronic liver disease in overweight participants drinking above limits was 3.32 (95%CI 2.88 to 3.83) and relative risk in obese participants drinking above limits was 5·39 (95%CI 4.62 to 6·29). CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis found the combination of alcohol consumption above recommended limits and overweight/obesity was associated with a significantly increased risk of chronic liver disease.

Stay at home orders and social distancing guidelines were in place, which has had a direct effect on American lives: forcing the cancellation of events, ending in-person school or childcare, forcing remote work environments, and leading to drastic changes to recreational activities. All these life changes can be experienced as losses that lead to real grief. However, grieving in the time of COVID-19 is fraught with unique challenges. This study recruited 257 participants from across North America to participate in an online survey investigating the types of losses experienced due to COVID-19, feelings of guilt and delegitimization, communal coping, and general coping behaviors. Results indicate that people experienced various losses during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which were compounded and varying in degrees of intensity (e.g., loss of a loved one, loss of a job, loss of physical activity routine). Because of these differences in intensity, people felt guilty for grieving over their losses, and subsequently were less likely to appraise the losses as communal and more likely to utilize avoidant coping mechanisms on their own. The theoretical and public health implications of the study are discussed.","Scheinfeld, Emily; Gangi, Katlyn; Nelson, Erin C; Sinardi, Catherine C",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2021.1886413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33586557/,12

This review summarizes the latest mechanistic insights on RBC clearance in different contexts; during homeostatic removal, immune-mediated destruction, and systemic inflammation. RECENT FINDINGS Besides the recognition of a variety of potential 'eat me' signals on RBCs, recent evidence suggests that normal RBC degradation is driven by the increase of the adhesive properties of RBCs, mediating the retention in the spleen and leading to RBC hemolysis. Furthermore, immune-mediated degradation of RBCs seems to be fine-tuned by the balance between the density of the antigens expressed on RBCs and the presence of 'don't eat me' signals. Moreover, besides RBC clearance by macrophages, neutrophils seem to play a much more prominent role in immune-mediated RBC removal than anticipated. Lastly, RBC clearance during systemic inflammation appears to be driven by a combination of extreme macrophage activity in response to proinflammatory cytokines as well as direct damage of RBC by the inflammation or inflammatory agent.

While similarities exist, evidence suggests that the prehospital environment is distinctly different in many aspects. The prevention of errors requires attention to factors from the organisational and regulatory level down to specific tasks and patient characteristics. The evidence available suggests errors may occur in up to 12.76% of medication administrations in some prehospital settings. With multiple sources stating that the errors are under-reported, this represents significant potential for patient harm. This review will seek to identify the factors influencing the occurrence of medication errors by paramedics in the prehospital environment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The review will include qualitative and quantitative studies involving interventions or phenomena regarding medication errors or medication safety relating to paramedics (including emergency medical technicians and other prehospital care providers) within the prehospital environment. A search will be conducted using MEDLINE (Ovid), EBSCOhost Megafile Search, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors trial registry, Google Scholar and the OpenGrey database to identify studies meeting this inclusion criteria, with initial searches commencing 30 September 2019. Studies selected will undergo assessment of methodological quality, with data to be extracted from all studies irrespective of quality. Each stage of study selection, appraisal and data extraction will be conducted by two reviewers, with a third reviewer deciding any unresolved conflicts. The review will follow a convergent integrated approach, conducting a single qualitative synthesis of qualitative and 'qualitised' quantitative data.

We aimed to test discipline (speed and technical) and performance (event-specific world standing) effects on lower-limb force-production qualities. National-level skiers (N=31) performed loaded squat jumps and isometric mid-thigh pulls to detect dynamic force output at extremely low and high velocities and maximum isometric force and rate of force development, respectively. Discipline differences were assessed via a general linear model including performance and allowing for interaction effects, with performance associations further characterized via distinct Pearson's correlations. Jump height did not differentiate disciplines, with absolute power slightly higher in speed athletes (F(1,27 )=4.42, p=.045, ω2 =0.10), and neither variables were related to performance. Speed athletes possessed greater dynamic force at low velocities (F0 ; F(1,27 )=13.8, p<.001, ω2 =0.17), and greater relative and absolute maximum isometric force (F(1,25 )=11.19-20.70, ω2 =0.16-0.22, p<.003). Overall, higher ranked athletes possessed more force dominant profiles (F(1,27 )=16.28, ω2 =0.34; r=-0.60 to -0.67, p<.001) and increased rate of force development characteristics (average and maximum, r=-0.50 to -0.82, p<.048). Very robust associations existed between maximum isometric force and speed performance (r=-0.88, p<.001), but only a trend for higher absolute isometric force in technical athletes (r=-0.49, p=.052). Alpine skiers display a preponderance for dynamic force output at low velocities, and isometric force for speed athletes, which highlights the interest in specific assessment and conditioning practices for ski athletes.","Cross, Matthew R; Rivière, Jean Romain; Coulmy, Nicolas; Morin, Jean-Benoit; Samozino, Pierre",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.13897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33259106/,12

PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a retrospective single institution study. We defined palliative radiotherapy (PRT) initiated before Saturday, March 14th as pre-COVID and PRT initiated later as during-COVID (through June 30th). RESULTS National COVID-19 recommendations led to a significant decrease in PRT with 10 or more fractions, while re-irradiation and radiotherapy during the final 30 days of life were equally common before and after these recommendations had been issued in March 2020. CONCLUSION Rapid adoption of modified PRT regimens was feasible. However, the challenge of overtreatment in the final phase of the disease, due to inaccurate survival prediction, persisted.","Nieder, Carsten; Haukland, Ellinor C; Mannsaker, Bard; Yobuta, Rosalba",In vivo,https://doi.org/10.21873/invivo.12304; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33402522/,12

In this series of 200 consecutive endovascular procedures for unruptured intracranial aneurysms, 65% of patients were triaged to routine (non-intensive care unit) floor care based on intraoperative findings, aneurysm morphology, and absence of major co-morbidities. Only 1 patient (0.5%) required subsequent transfer to the intensive care unit for management of a perioperative complication. The authors conclude that patients without major co-morbidities, intraoperative complications, or complex aneurysm morphology can be safely observed in a regular ward rather than being admitted to the intensive care unit.","Burrows, A M; Rabinstein, A A; Cloft, H J; Kallmes, D F; Lanzino, G",AJNR.

A hospice volunteer, I instigated an online day therapy programme for patients previously attending face-to-face day therapy. Participant feedback revealed the importance of providing a space for ongoing peer support for participants' changing sense of identity, an issue for time-limited day therapy programmes. An exploration of key concepts associated with palliative care established the multiple connections between such changing identity and arts-based approaches to living well. This article charts how I used this understanding to develop an alternative, online arts-based support programme, Live well, die well. It explores the links between ongoing mutual support, arts-based activity and the reactions to a shifting identity in patients with a life-limiting illness.","Roberts, Amanda",Omega,https://doi.org/10.1177/00302228211009753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33840273/,12

Patients who are poor candidates for arteriovenous access creation require long-term catheter placement. Problems such as dialysate recirculation, thrombosis, catheter-related infections, and malfunction can occur with HD catheters. Different tip designs (step, split, and symmetrical) have been developed to ameliorate the catheter-related problems. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of split-tip, step-tip, and symmetrical-tip HD catheters. METHODS The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry were searched for studies published before November 2017. Studies comparing the clinical and rheologic outcomes of step-, split-, or symmetrical-tip catheters in patients undergoing HD were included in this meta-analysis. We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models. The primary outcomes were catheter survival time and incidence of functioning catheters. The secondary outcomes were delivered blood flow rate, blood recirculation rate, and incidence of catheter-related complications. RESULTS Seven randomized controlled trials and one retrospective study with a total of 988 patients were included. No significant differences were observed in the delivered blood flow rate (weighted mean difference, -5.37 mL/min; 95% confidence interval [CI], -23.75 to 13.02), incidence of catheter-related infections (risk ratio [RR], 1.18; 95% CI, 0.63-2.22), or incidence of catheter-related thrombosis (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.64-2.59) between step-tip catheters and advanced (both split-tip and symmetrical-tip) catheters. Moreover, a meta-analysis of the incidence of functioning catheters at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months revealed that the outcome of step-tip catheter use was better than that of split-tip catheter use, but with a significant difference only at 6 months (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02-1.46). CONCLUSIONS None of the catheter types exhibited unique features that can enhance their suitability for application. Hence, catheters can be selected by also considering different factors, including costs, ease of procedures, expertise of the clinician, and education and preference of the patient.","Ling, Xiao-Chun; Lu, Hsi-Peng; Loh, El-Wui; Lin, Yen-Kuang; Li, Yi-Shiuan; Lin, Cheng-Hsin; Ko, Yu-Chen; Wu, Mei-Yi; Lin, Yuh-Feng; Tam, Ka-Wai",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2018.09.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905366/,12

In contrast, little is known about how these areas integrate memory information to lead to similar decisions. Using serial order learning, we explore how fragments of information, learned and stored independently (e.g., A > B and B > C), are linked in an abstract representation according to their reciprocal relations (such as A > B > C) and how this representation can be accessed and manipulated to make decisions. We show that manipulating information after learning occurs with increased difficulty as logical relationships get closer in the mental map and that the activity of neurons in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) encodes the difficulty level during target selection for motor decision making at the single-neuron and population levels.","Mione, Valentina; Brunamonti, Emiliano; Pani, Pierpaolo; Genovesio, Aldo; Ferraina, Stefano",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726625/,12

We investigate the uptake of (1) video and telephone telehealth consultations in April-May 2020, and (2) the overall changing rates of consultation, i.e. total telehealth and in-person consultations across the larger states of Australia. METHOD MBS item service data were extracted for COVID-19 psychiatrist video- and telephone-telehealth item numbers and compared with a baseline of the 2018-2019-financial-year monthly average of in-person consultations for New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia. RESULTS Total psychiatry consultations (telehealth and in-person) rose during the first wave of the pandemic by 10%-20% compared to the previous year. The majority of private practice was conducted by telehealth in April but was lower in May as new COVID-19 case rates fell. Most telehealth provision was by telephone for short consultations of ⩽15-30 min. Video consultations increased from April into May. CONCLUSIONS For large states, there has been a rapid adoption of the MBS telehealth psychiatrist items, followed by a trend back to face-to-face as COVID-19 new case rates reduced. There was an overall increased consultation rate (in-person plus telehealth) for April-May 2020.","Looi, Jeffrey Cl; Allison, Stephen; Bastiampillai, Tarun; Pring, William",Australasian psychiatry : bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856220961906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32997521/,12

Many studies have found continued expression of E6 and E7 proteins in the majority of cervical cancer cases, but not in normal tissues. These results indicated that the E6 and E7 proteins could be ideal candidate therapeutic vaccines against HPV-16 infection and cervical cancer. Using the Immune Epitope Database Analysis Resource, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes of the HPV-16 E6 and E7 proteins were predicted according to worldwide frequency distributions of HLA-A alleles (HLA-A*01:01, -A*02:01, -A*02:06, -A*03:01, -A*11:01, -A*24:02, -A*26:01, -A*31:01 and -A*33:03). Our results predicted a total of 81 epitopes of HPV-16 E6 (n=59) and E7 (n=22). Epitope cluster analysis showed that among the 20 clusters of HPV-16 E6, cluster 3 contained the most epitopes (10 epitopes), which was represented by HLA-A*31:01 and -A*33:03. Of the 10 clusters of HPV-16 E7, cluster 3 contained the most epitopes (5 epitopes), which was represented by HLA-A*01:01 and -A*26:01.

We aim to determine the correlation between ASPECTS and CTP ischemic core, evaluate the variability of core volumes within ASPECTS strata, and assess the strength of their association with clinical outcomes. METHODS Review of a prospective, single-center database of consecutive thrombectomies of middle cerebral or intracranial internal carotid artery occlusions with pretreatment CTP between September 2010 and September 2015. CTP was processed with RAPID software to identify ischemic core (relative cerebral blood flow<30% of normal tissue). RESULTS Three hundred and thirty-two patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Median age was 66 years (55-75), median ASPECTS was 8 (7-9), whereas median CTP ischemic core was 11 cc (2-27). Median time from last normal to groin puncture was 5.8 hours (3.9-8.8), and 90-day modified Rankin scale score 0 to 2 was observed in 54%. The correlation between CTP ischemic core and ASPECTS was fair (R=-0.36; P<0.01). Twenty-six patients (8%) had ASPECTS <6 and CTP core ≤50 cc (37% had modified Rankin scale score 0-2, whereas 29% were deceased at 90 days). Conversely, 27 patients (8%) had CTP core >50 cc and ASPECTS ≥6 (29% had modified Rankin scale 0-2, whereas 21% were deceased at 90 days). Moderate correlations between ASPECTS and final infarct volume (R=-0.42; P<0.01) and between CTP ischemic core and final infarct volume (R=0.50; P<0.01) were observed; coefficients were not significantly influenced by the time from stroke onset to presentation. Multivariable regression indicated ASPECTS ≥6 (odds ratio 4.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.47-11.46; P=0.01) and CTP core ≤50 cc (odds ratio 3.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-12.15; P=0.02) independently and comparably predictive of good outcome. CONCLUSIONS There is wide variability of CTP-derived core volumes within ASPECTS strata.

In the midst of the discussion on how to overcome these barriers, the question of whether the use of guidelines leads to improved patient outcomes threatens to be overlooked. This study examined the effectiveness of evidence-based guidelines for all psychiatric disorders on patient health outcomes in specialist mental health care. All types of evidence-based guidelines, such as psychological- and medication-focused guidelines, were eligible for inclusion. Provider performance was measured as a secondary outcome. Time to remission when treated with the guidelines was also examined. METHOD Six databases were searched until 10 August 2020. Studies were selected and data was extracted independently according to the PRISMA guidelines. Random effects meta-analyses were used to pool estimates across studies. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Review Group criteria. PROSPERO CRD42020171311. RESULTS The meta-analysis included 18 studies (N=5380). Guidelines showed a positive significant effect size on the severity of psychopathological symptoms at the patient level when compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU) (d=0.29,95%-CI=(0.19,0.40),p<0.001). Removal of a potential outlier gave globally the same results with Cohen's d=0.26. Time to remission was shorter in the guideline treatment compared with TAU (HR=1.54, 95%-CI=(1.29, 1.84),p=0.001,n=3). CONCLUSIONS Patients cared for with guideline-adherent treatments improve to a greater degree and more quickly than patients treated with TAU. Knowledge on the mechanisms of change during guideline-adherent treatment needs to be developed further such that we can provide the best possible treatment to patients in routine care.","Setkowski, Kim; Boogert, Kelly; Hoogendoorn, Adriaan W; Gilissen, Renske; van Balkom, Anton J L M",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/acps.13332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34033121/,12

METHODS Cross-sectional, community-based, nationally representative data from the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) were analyzed. Self-reported past 12-month food insecurity was assessed with two questions on frequency of eating less and hunger due to lack of food. Questions based on the World Mental Health Survey version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were used for the endorsement of past 12-month DSM-IV depression. Multivariable logistic regression analysis and meta-analysis were conducted to assess associations. RESULTS In total, 34,129 individuals aged ≥50 years [mean (SD) age, 62.4 (16.0) years; 52.1% females] were included in the analysis. Overall, the prevalence of moderate and severe food insecurity was 6.7% and 5.1%, respectively, while the prevalence of depression was 6.0%. Meta-analyses based on countrywise estimates showed that overall, moderate food insecurity (vs. no food insecurity) is associated with a nonsignificant 1.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.82-3.48) times higher odds for depression, while severe food insecurity is significantly associated with 2.43 (95% CI = 1.65-3.57) times higher odds for depression. CONCLUSIONS In this large representative sample of older adults from six LMICs, those with severe food insecurity were over two times more likely to suffer from depression (compared with no food insecurity). Utilizing lay health counselors and psychological interventions may be effective mechanisms to reduce depression among food-insecure populations. Interventions to address food insecurity (e.g., supplemental nutrition programs) may reduce depression at the population level but future longitudinal studies are warranted.","Smith, Lee; Il Shin, Jae; McDermott, Daragh; Jacob, Louis; Barnett, Yvonne; López-Sánchez, Guillermo F; Veronese, Nicola; Yang, Lin; Soysal, Pinar; Oh, Hans; Grabovac, Igor; Koyanagi, Ai",Depression and anxiety,https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33687122/,12

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of mesh fixation in terms of postsurgical chronic pain and recurrence. METHODS Sixty patients with primary inguinal hernias were treated between March 2007 and December 2008. Thirty patients underwent conventional Lichtenstein repair while a self-adhesive mesh was used for the second group. The primary outcome parameters were the rate of recurrence and chronic pain. The operating time, postoperative pain, complications, and time when patients returned to work were recorded. RESULTS Fifty-one patients completed the survey. Early pain scores were lower in the self-adhesive mesh group. The main advantage of the self-adhesive mesh was the shorter operating time (23.70 ± 5.57 vs 36.90 ± 11.36, P = 0.006). Both techniques were almost identical in terms of long-term chronic pain (P = 0.294), and the rates of recurrence at the end of a median of 31 months' follow-up were identical. CONCLUSION Self-adhesive mesh repair of inguinal hernias is superior to the conventional Lichtenstein method in terms of shorter operative time and less pain in the early postoperative period. The rates of chronic pain and recurrence are similar with the suture-fixed repairs.","Anadol, A Ziya; Akin, Murat; Kurukahvecioglu, Osman; Tezel, Ekmel; Ersoy, Emin",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-011-4545-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21969152/,12

OBJECTIVE To describe our endovascular experience in a consecutive series of patients with COVID-19 who presented with large vessel occlusions, and to describe unique findings in this population. METHODS Mechanical thrombectomy was performed on five consecutive patients with COVID-19 with large vessel occlusions. A retrospective study of these patients was performed. Patient demographics, laboratory values, mechanical thrombectomy technique, and clinical and angiographic outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Four patients with COVID-19 presented with anterior circulation occlusions and one patient with COVID-19 presented with both anterior and posterior circulation occlusions. All patients had coagulation abnormalities. Mean patient age was 52.8 years. Three patients presented with an intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion. Two patients presented with an intracranial occlusion and a tandem thrombus in the carotid bulb. One patient presented with an occlusion in both the internal carotid and basilar arteries. Clot fragmentation and distal emboli to a new vascular territory were seen in two of five (40%) patients, and downstream emboli were seen in all five (100%) patients. Patient clinical outcome was generally poor in this series of patients with COVID-19 large vessel occlusion. CONCLUSION Our series of patients with COVID-19 demonstrated coagulation abnormalities, and compared with our previous experience with mechanical thrombectomy in large vessel occlusion, this group of patients were younger, had tandem or multiple territory occlusions, a large clot burden, and a propensity for clot fragmentation. These patients present unique challenges that make successful revascularization difficult.","Wang, Arthur; Mandigo, Grace K; Yim, Peter D; Meyers, Philip M; Lavine, Sean D",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2020-016220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32451359/,12

The symptoms vary widely, from the absence of any symptoms to death. The severity of COVID-19 relates to hyperinflammatory conditions with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which leads to multiple-organ failure and death. Innate immunity plays an important role in the early response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and regulates the pathogenesis and its clinical outcomes. The most severe cases of COVID-19 present with increased innate immune cell infiltration in the lung, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood serum that are associated with disease severity. Here we review the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the recent reports and discuss the potential roles of innate immune cells and their mediators in pathogenesis that dictate the outcome of the disease. Understanding the roles of innate immune responses at the initial stages of infection may provide early windows into treatment and clues for vaccine development.","Ruenjaiman, Vichaya; Hirankarn, Nattiya; Palaga, Tanapat",Asian Pacific journal of allergy and immunology,https://doi.org/10.12932/ap-130121-1037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34174806/,12

At present, the management and risk assessment of asymptomatic infected cases has become an urgent problem to be addressed. Asymptomatic case is mainly detected by close contact screening, cluster epidemic investigation, infection source tracking investigation, and active detection of target population. Currently, research on the spread risk from asymptomatic cases was limited, and lacking the data relates to the distribution of asymptomatic cases in large community population. Pathogen detection using PCR is suitable for screening in close contacts of confirmed cases and should be started as early as possible. The antibody test is more suitable for screening in general population where the source of infection is unclear. The management of asymptomatic cases now in China focuses on isolation and medical observation according to the guideline of ""early detection, early report, early isolation and early treatment"" .","Gao, W J; Zheng, K; Ke, J; Li, L M",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200404-00514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32741160/,12

It is necessary to fully understand the occupational risks of health workers to protect them and reduce their risk of infection. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to obtain comprehensive and detailed information on occupational risk factors of infectious diseases for HWs in different dimensions and to propose control strategies for three risk dimensions to protect HWs who are at high risk of infection during the pandemic. METHODS A total number of 619 articles published from 2010 to 2021 were searched to conduct bibliometric analysis, which were retrieved in the Web of Science database with defined search terms. There were 26 articles met the criteria, and they were screened to identify occupational risk factors. RESULTS We conducted an analysis of cited institutions, co-citation network analysis of journals, and references from bibliometric analysis. Nine risk factors were extracted, and they were classified and sorted into three dimensions. Infection control strategies for each dimension were proposed. CONCLUSIONS The risk of infection faced by HWs is unprecedented. Medical institutions should pay more attention to the nine risk factors that we identified and use the three risk dimensions to carry out risk identification and infection control to reduce the infection risk of HWs and protect them better.","Jin, Haizhe; Chen, Yuxiao; Fu, Quanwei; Qu, Qingxing",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-210477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180449/,12

The purpose of the study was to dissect whether CagY might be the H. pylori antigen able to drive B cell proliferation. METHODS the B cells and the clonal progeny of T cells from the gastric mucosa of five patients with MALT lymphoma were compared with those of T cell clones obtained from five H. pylori-infected patients with chronic gastritis. The T cell clones were assessed for their specificity to H. pylori CagY, cytokine profile and helper function for B cell proliferation. RESULTS 22 of 158 CD4+ (13.9%) gastric clones from MALT lymphoma and three of 179 CD4+ (1.7%) clones from chronic gastritis recognized CagY. CagY predominantly drives Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Interleukin-17 (IL-17) secretion by gastric CD4+ T cells from H. pylori-infected patients with low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma. All MALT lymphoma-derived clones dose dependently increased their B cell help, whereas clones from chronic gastritis lost helper activity at T-to-B-cell ratios greater than 1. CONCLUSION the results obtained indicate that CagY drives both B cell proliferation and T cell activation in gastric MALT lymphomas.","Della Bella, Chiara; Soluri, Maria Felicia; Puccio, Simone; Benagiano, Marisa; Grassi, Alessia; Bitetti, Jacopo; Cianchi, Fabio; Sblattero, Daniele; Peano, Clelia; D'Elios, Mario Milco",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22179459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502367/,12

Several techniques exist for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography (OCTA) is a recently developed technique that provides a quantitative assessment of the microcirculation of the retina and choroid in a fast, noninvasive way. Despite it being a novel technique, several publications have already been done in the glaucoma field. However, a summary of findings is currently lacking. AIMS To perform a literature review to assess the role of OCTA in glaucoma diagnosis and follow-up. METHODS A database search was carried out using MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science, including all original works registered until July 23, 2017. RESULTS OCTA (1) has a high repeatability and reproducibility, (2) has good discriminatory power to differentiate normal eyes from glaucoma eyes, (3) is more strongly correlated with visual function than conventional OCT, (4) has good discriminatory power to differentiate early-glaucoma eyes from normal eyes (i.e., at least equal to that of OCT), (5) reaches a floor effect at a more advanced disease stage than OCT, and (6) is able to detect progression in glaucoma eyes.

The IBV 793/B strain has identified to circulate in Iran; therefore, the development of a specific vaccine to protect against the virulent virus has received attention. In this regard, the live IB 793/B vaccine (793/B.08IR) was developed in the Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute. In this study, the immunogenicity of 793/B.08IR vaccine via different routes of vaccination and efficacy of the vaccine were determined in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. Three treatment groups of 10 SPF chickens received the vaccine via eye drops, spray, and drinking water. The sera were collected from the chicks at 3 and 6 weeks after the vaccination, and IBV specific antibody was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and serum neutralization (SN) test. To evaluate 793/B.08IR vaccine efficacy, 10 SPF chickens were vaccinated using eye drops. Moreover, 10 unvaccinated chickens were separately retained as negative controls. The birds were challenged with the virulent virus 3 weeks following the vaccination. Five days after the challenge, the tracheal swab was taken for virus reisolation. In the immunogenicity test, the ELISA titers of three vaccinated groups were significantly higher than the background values obtained in the control group (p<0.0001). The mean value of ELISA titer in the spray vaccinated group was higher than the spray and drinking water vaccinated groups 3 weeks following the vaccination; however, the difference was not statistically significant. No differences were observed in antibody titers among the three vaccinated groups 6 weeks after the vaccination. The results of the SN test confirmed the data obtained from the ELISA. The results of antibody titer and its increasing trend in chickens showed that 793/B.08IR vaccine induce proper immunity against the virus. In the efficacy test, IBV was isolated from 90% of the unvaccinated controls and 10% of vaccinated groups. The results of the recovery of the virus after the challenge showed that 793/B.08IR vaccine can provide a significantly improved protection against the pathogen in SPF vaccinated chickens.","Masoudi, S; Pishraft Sabet, L; Shahsavadi, Sh",Archives of Razi Institute,https://doi.org/10.22092/ari.2019.124720.1286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32291999/,12

The aryl 1,2,3-triazole motifs within these azanucleosides showed coplanar features, suggesting they could act as surrogates for large planar aromatic systems or nucleobases. Moreover, several aryltriazole acyclic C-azanucleosides bearing long alkyl chains exhibited potent antiproliferative activity against various cancer cell lines via induction of apoptosis. Most interestingly, the lead compound significantly down-regulated the key proteins involved in the heat shock response pathway, representing the first anticancer acyclic azanucleoside with such a mode of action. These novel aryl 1,2,3-triazole cyclic C-azanucleosides therefore serve as promising paradigms for further exploring anticancer drug candidates.","Zhang, Yanhua; Lin, Yun; Hou, Qianqian; Liu, Xi; Pricl, Sabrina; Peng, Ling; Xia, Yi",Organic & biomolecular chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0ob02164d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33232421/,12

147165,Innate lymphoid cell and adaptive immune cell cross-talk: A talk meant not to forget.,2020-06-18,"BACKGROUND Anastomotic failure causes morbidity and mortality even in technically correct anastomoses. Initial leaks must be prevented by mucosal reapproximation across the anastomosis. Healing is a concerted effort between intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), immune cells, and commensal bacteria. IEC TLR4 activation and signaling is required for mucosal healing, leading to inflammatory factor release that recruits immune cells to limit bacteria invasion. TLR4 absence leads to mucosal damage from loss in epithelial proliferation, attenuated inflammatory response, and bacteria translocation. We hypothesize after anastomosis, an imbalance in microbiota will occur due to a decrease in TLR4 expression and will lead to changes in the immune milieu. RESULTS We isolated fecal content and small intestinal leukocytes from murine, Roux-en-Y and end-to-end anastomoses, to identify microbiome changes and subsequent alterations in the regulatory and pro-inflammatory immune cells 3 days post-operative. TLR4+ IECs were impaired after anastomosis. Microbiome diversity was reduced, with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Saccharibacteria decreased and Proteobacteria increased. A distinct TCRβhi CD4+ T cells subset after anastomosis was 10-20-fold greater than in control mice. 84% were Th17 IL-17A/F+ IL-22+ and/or TNFα+. iNKT cells were increased and TCRβhi. 75% were iNKT IL-10+ and 13% iNKTh17 IL-22+. Additionally, Treg IL-10+ and IL-22+ cells were increased. A novel dendritic cell subset was identified in anastomotic regions that was CD11bhi CD103mid and was 93% IL-10+. CONCLUSIONS This anastomotic study demonstrated a decrease in IEC TLR4 expression and microbiome diversity which then coincided with increased expansion of regulatory and pro-inflammatory immune cells and cytokines. Defining the anastomotic mucosal environment could help inform innovative therapeutics to target excessive pro-inflammatory invasion and microbiome imbalance.","Vomhof-DeKrey, Emilie E; Stover, Allie; Basson, Marc D",Gut pathogens,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13099-021-00447-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34376235/,12

We used multivariable logistic regression analyses with 3-level hierarchical adjustments to identify the association of pre-operative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with PPCs in laparoscopic surgeries. Among 452,213 patients between 2005 and 2013 in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) Database, a total of 3,727 patients (0.9%) experienced PPCs. We found a gradient association between lower eGFR and higher likelihood of PPCs in the unadjusted model. In the case-mix adjusted model, a reverse-J-shaped association was observed; a small albeit significant association with the highest eGFR category emerged. Further adjustment slightly attenuated these associations, but the PPCs risk in the eGFR groups of <30, 30-60, and ≥120 mL/min/1.73 m2 remained significant: odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 1.82 (1.54-2.16), 1.38 (1.24-1.54), and 1.28 (1.07-1.53), respectively (reference: 90-120 mL/min/1.73 m2).

In this setting, medical students in particular have limited opportunities for experiential learning. We report on a student-faculty collaboration that has successfully operated an annual, short-term surgical intervention in Haiti for the last three years. Medical students were responsible for logistics and were overseen by faculty members for patient care. Substantial planning with local partners ensured that trip activities supplemented existing surgical services. A case review was performed hypothesizing that such trips could provide effective surgical care while also providing a suitable educational experience. FINDINGS Over three week-long trips, 64 cases were performed without any reported complications, and no immediate perioperative morbidity or mortality. A plurality of cases were complex urological procedures that required surgical skills that were locally unavailable (43%). Surgical productivity was twice that of comparable peer institutions in the region. Student roles in patient care were greatly expanded in comparison to those at U.S. academic medical centers and appropriate supervision was maintained. DISCUSSION This demonstration project suggests that a properly designed surgical trip model can effectively balance the surgical needs of the community with an opportunity to expose young trainees to a clinical and cross-cultural experience rarely provided at this early stage of medical education. Few formalized programs currently exist although the experience above suggests the rewarding potential for broad-based adoption.","Leeds, Ira L; Creighton, Francis X; Wheatley, Matthew A; Macleod, Jana B; Srinivasan, Jahnavi; Chery, Marie P; Master, Viraj A",BMC research notes,https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-4-317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21884604/,12

This study aimed at investigating the nature and related factors of the psychological responses of MERS victims during the acute phase of disaster. METHODS The MERS Psychological Support Team under the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare provided counseling services to MERS survivors and bereaved families for 4 weeks, based on crisis intervention. In this study, we reviewed the counseling records of 109 survivors and 80 bereaved family members, and analyzed their epidemiological and MERS-related information along with psychological responses. RESULTS Somatic symptoms and anxiety related to social stigmatization or disease transmission were common in MERS survivors, whereas grief reactions such as sadness, and anger were frequently observed in bereaved families. Bereaved MERS survivors showed more avoidance/isolation than non-bereaved MERS survivors. Females, those with an underlying physical or psychiatric health condition, and those having experienced longer duration of hospitalization and non-healthcare workers were more at risk of suffering from psychological problems. CONCLUSIONS Survivors and bereaved families of epidemics can experience various psychological distresses depending on individual characteristics and the inherent features of the epidemic. Therefore, mental health in epidemics should be approached and considered more seriously.","Lee, Dayoung; Lee, Junghyun H; Jeon, Kyoungsun; Lee, Nabin; Sim, Minyoung",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.32; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33977892/,12

151287,Closure of a persistent esophagopleural fistula by use of an atrial septal occluder device.,2016,"We report an option for delta-shaped gastroduodenostomy in totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) for gastric cancer. We detail a single-layer suturing technique for the endoscopic linear stapler entry hole using knotless barbed sutures combined with the application of additional knotted sutures. From June 2013 to February 2017, we performed TLDG with delta-shaped gastroduodenostomy in 20 patients with gastric cancer. The linear stapler was closed and fired to attach the posterior walls of the remnant stomach and the duodenum together. After creating a good view of the greater curvature side of the entry hole for the stapler by retracting the knotted suture on the lesser curvature side toward the ventral side, we performed single-layer entire-thickness continuous suturing of this hole using a 15-cm-long barbed suture running from the greater curvature side to the lesser curvature side. We placed the second and third stitches between the seromuscular layer of the remnant stomach and the entire-thickness layer of the duodenum while suturing the duodenal mucosa as minutely as possible. In addition, we routinely added one or two entire-thickness knotted sutures at the site near the greater curvature side. We placed similar additional knotted sutures at the site with a broad pitch. TLDG with this reconstruction technique was successfully performed in all patients with no occurrences of anastomotic leakage or intraabdominal abscess around the anastomosis. It is suggested that this method can be one option for delta-shaped gastroduodenostomy in TLDG due to its cost-effectiveness and feasibility.","Tokuhara, Takaya; Nakata, Eiji; Tenjo, Toshiyuki; Kawai, Isao; Kondo, Keisaku; Ueda, Hirofumi; Tomioka, Atsushi",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2017.7306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29375711/,12

Objectives Evaluation of cytological physiognomies in relation to possible age influence and the genotype distribution of human papillomaviruses among HPV/HIV co-infected and HPV monoinfected women in Kisii, Kenya. Methods The case-control study enrolled 42 HPV/HIV co-infected and 42 HPV monoinfected women. Cervical swabs were collected in ThinPrep vials for HPV tying and cytological analysis. HPV subtypes were assayed by Xpert® HPV system (GXHPV-CE-10). Results Mono-infected women aged 30-39 years had the highest proportion of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) at 14 (16.67%) while the co-infected aged 50-59 years had the highest proportion of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) at 9 (10.71%). HPV-16 genotype was the most predominant and it increased with age rise. Older coinfected and mono-infected women (>40 years) had HSIL and LSIL as the most predominant cytological grade respectively. Conclusion The predominance of HPV-16 and HPV-18/45 genotypes in the study setting is a consideration that would benefit targeted prophylactic vaccination programs.

151925,Ag5IO6: novel antibiofilm activity of a silver compound with application to medical devices.,2015,"INTRODUCTION Flow diverters (FDs) are increasingly used in the treatment of wide-necked aneurysms. OBJECTIVE To examine the hypothesis that intentional FD compaction might improve aneurysm occlusion rates. METHODS Bilateral wide-necked carotid aneurysms were created in 12 dogs. Endovascular treatment was performed 1 month later, using Pipeline embolization devices deployed with compaction across the aneurysm neck (n=12). Group 1a consisted of aneurysms treated with a single compacted FD (n=8), while group 1b aneurysms required two compacted FDs (n=4). Control aneurysms were treated with a single non-compacted FD (group 3; n=6), or not treated (group 4; n=4). Angiographic results were compared at 3 months. Pathology specimens were photographed and the neointimal coverage of devices scored using an ordinal grading system. RESULTS Twenty-two of 24 aneurysms were patent at 1 month. Deployment with compaction was successful in eight cases (group 1a aneurysms). The compaction maneuver led to immediate FD prolapse into the aneurysm in four cases, rescued by deploying a second, telescoping FD (forming group 1b aneurysms). One compacted device later migrated distally, leaving the aneurysm untreated. Angiographic results differed significantly between groups (p=0.0002). At 3 months, aneurysms successfully treated with a single compacted FD were more often occluded at 3 months (7/7) than aneurysms flow-diverted without compaction (2/6; p=0.021). All aneurysms treated with two compacted FDs were occluded, while all untreated aneurysms remained patent. There were no parent vessel stenoses. CONCLUSIONS Compaction of FDs can improve angiographic occlusion of experimental wide-necked aneurysms.","Gentric, Jean-Christophe; Salazkin, Igor; Gevry, Guylaine; Raymond, Jean; Darsaut, Tim",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26453605/,12

Recently, divergent filoviruses (FiVs) have been identified in bats within this region, which pose a potential risk to public health, but their true infection situation in bats remains largely unclear. Here, 689 archived bat serum samples were analyzed by ELISA, western blot and neutralization assay to investigate the seroprevalence and cross-reactivity of four divergent FiVs and two other viruses (Rabies virus and Tuhoko pararubulavirus 1) of different families within the order Mononegavirales Results showed no cross-antigenicity between FiVs and other mononegaviruses, but different cross-reactivity among the FiVs themselves. The total FiV seroreactive rate was 36.3% (250/689), with infection by the indigenous Chinese FiV DH04 or antigenically-related one being the most widely and the most highly prevalent. Further viral metagenomic analysis of fruit bat tissues also identified the gene sequence of a novel FiV. These results indicate the likely prevalence of other so far unidentified FiVs within Chinese bat population, with frugivorous Rousettus leschenaulti and Eonycteris spelaea bats and insectivorous Myotis horsfieldii and M. schreibersi bats being their major reservoirs.IMPORTANCE Bats are natural hosts of many FiVs, from which diverse FiVs were serologically or virologically detected in Africa, Europe and East Asia. Recently, very divergent FiVs were identified in Chinese bat population, but their antigenic relationship with other known FiVs remains unknown. Here we conducted serological characterization and investigation of Chinese indigenous FiVs and prototypes of other viruses in bats. Results indicated that Chinese indigenous FiVs are antigenically distant to other FiVs and infection of novel or multiple FiVs occurred in Chinese bats with FiV DH04 or antigenically-related one being the most widely and the most highly prevalent. Additionally, besides Rousettus leschenaulti and Eonycteris spelaea bats, the insectivorous Myotis horsfieldii and M. schreibersi bats are highly preferential hosts of FiVs. Seroreactive and viral metagenomic results indicated that more as yet unknown bat-borne FiVs circulate in the Southern China, and to uncover them further investigation and timely surveillance is needed.","Zhang, Chang; Wang, Zhongyi; Cai, Jianqiu; Yan, Xiaomin; Zhang, Fuqiang; Wu, Jianmin; Xu, Lin; Zhao, Zongzheng; Hu, Tingsong; Tu, Changchun; He, Biao",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02042-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31941778/,12

After an uneventful procedure and initial periprocedural period, the patient experienced an unexpected fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage 1 week later. Autopsy demonstrated extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage and aneurysm rupture (linear whole wall rupture). The patent Pipeline Embolization Device was in its intended location, as was the persistent coil occlusion of the distal left vertebral artery. The aneurysm appeared to rupture in a linear manner and contained a thick large expansile clot that seemed to disrupt or rupture the thin aneurysm wall directly opposite the basilar artery/Pipeline Embolization Device. We feel the pattern of aneurysm rupture in our patient supports the idea that the combination of flow diversion and the resulting growing intra-aneurysmal thrombus can create a mechanical force with the potential to cause aneurysm rupture.","Fox, Benjamin; Humphries, William Edward; Doss, Vinodh T; Hoit, Daniel; Elijovich, Lucas; Arthur, Adam S",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011325.rep; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25361560/,12

153320,A Consensus Definitive Classification of Scavenger Receptors and Their Roles in Health and Disease.,2017,"BACKGROUND Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disorder of the pancreas that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Chaiqin chengqi decoction (CQCQD) has been proven clinically to be an effective treatment for AP for decades in West China Hospital. Quality control for CQCQD containing many hundreds of characteristic phytochemicals poses a challenge for developing robust quality assessment metrics. PURPOSE To evaluate quality consistency of CQCQD with a multi-strategy based analytical method, identify potential quality-markers (Q-markers) based on drug properties and effect characteristics, and endeavor to establish CQCQD as a globally-accepted medicine. METHODS A typical analysis of constitutive medicinal plant materials was performed following the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. The extraction process was optimized through an orthogonal array (L9(34)) to evaluate three levels of liquid to solid ratio, soaking time, duration of extraction, and the number of extractions. An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) fingerprinting combined with absolute quantitation of multi chemical marker compounds, coupled with similarity, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), and principal component analyses (PCA) were performed to evaluate 10 batches of CQCQD. On the basis of systematic analysis of fundamental features of CQCQD in treating AP, the potential Q-marker screen was proposed through detection of quality transfer and efficacy for chemical markers. UHPLC coupled with quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry were used to determine compounds in medicinal materials, decoctions and plasma. Network pharmacology and taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate induced pancreatic acinar cell death were used to evaluate the correlation between chemical markers and anti-pancreatitis activity. A cerulein induced AP murine model was used to validate quality assessed CQCQD batches at clinically-equivalent dose. The effective content of chemical markers was predicted using linear regression analysis on quantitative information between validated batches and the other batches. RESULTS The chemical markers and other physical and chemical indices in the original materials met Chinese Pharmacopoeia standards. A total of 22 co-existing fingerprint peaks were selected and the similarity varied between 0.946 and 0.990. Batch D10 possessed the highest similarity index. HCA classified the 10 batches into 2 main groups: 7 batches represented by D10 and 3 batches represented by D1. During the initial Q-marker screen stage, 22 compounds were detected in both plant materials and decoctions, while 13 compounds were identified in plasma. Network pharmacology predicted the potential targets and pathway of AP related to the 22 compounds. All 10 batches showed reduced necrosis below 60% with the best effect achieved by D10 (~40%). The spectrum-efficacy relationship analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis indicated that emodin, rhein, aloe emodin, geniposide, hesperridin, chrysin, syringin, synephrine, geniposidic acid, magnolol, physcion, sinensetin, and baicalein showed positive correlation with pancreatic acinar cell death protection. Similar to the in vitro evaluation, batch D10 significantly reduced total histopathological scores and biochemical severity indices at a clinically-equivalent dose but batch D1 did not. The content of naringin, narirutin and baicalin in batches D1, D5 and D9 consistently exceeds the upper limit of the predicted value. Eight markers whose lower limit is predicted to be close to 0 contributed less to the material basis for AP protection. CONCLUSION Despite qualified materials used for CQCQD preparation, the clinical effect depends on appropriate content range of Q-markers. Emodin, rhein, aloe emodin, magnolol, hesperidin, synephrine, baicalein, and geniposide are considered as vital Q-markers in the primary screen. This study proposed a feasible platform for producing highly consistent batches of CQCQD in future study.","Liang, Ge; Yang, Jingyu; Liu, Tingting; Wang, Shisheng; Wen, Yongjian; Han, Chenxia; Huang, Yan; Wang, Rui; Wang, Yiqin; Hu, Liqiang; Wang, Guangzhi; Li, Fei; Tyndall, Joel D A; Deng, Lihui; Du, Dan; Xia, Qing",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153525; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740732/,12

METHOD This is a case report describing the novel use of VAC (Vacuum-Assisted Closure Device) in the successful closure of a wound defect with cochlear implant hardware exposure post soft tissue infection during the Covid-19 pandemic. RESULTS While the VAC system was initiated for temporary wound coverage, it was observed at each dressing change to be successfully decreasing the soft tissue defect for our patient. This resulted in complete epithelisation of the soft tissue defect at Day 35 and avoidance of a surgical procedure. The patient was able to restart wearing her device on Day 50 and Cochlear MAPping performed on Day 58 showed minimal changes in patient's current requirements compared to her settings pre-infection.

TCS usually sinks in the activated sludge. However, the effects of TCS in activated sludge remain largely unknown. The changes in nitrogen cycles and the abundances of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) caused by TCS were investigated in this study. The addition of 1000 μg/L TCS significantly inhibited nitrification since the ammonia conversion rate and the abundance of nitrification functional genes decreased by 12.14%. The other nitrogen cycle genes involved in nitrogen fixation and denitrification were also suppressed. The microbial community shifted towards tolerance and degradation of phenols. The addition of 100 μg/L TCS remarkably increased the total abundance of ARGs and mobile genetic elements by 33.1%, and notably, the tetracycline and multidrug resistance genes increased by 54.75% and 103.42%, respectively. The co-occurrence network revealed that Flavobacterium might have played a key role in the spread of ARGs. The abundance of this genus increased 92-fold under the addition of 1000 μg/L TCS, indicating that Flavobacterium is potent in the tolerance and degradation of TCS. This work would help to better understand the effects of TCS in activated sludge and provide comprehensive insight into TCS management during the pandemic era.","Tan, Qiyang; Chen, Jinmei; Chu, Yifan; Liu, Wei; Yang, Lingli; Ma, Lin; Zhang, Yi; Qiu, Dongru; Wu, Zhenbin; He, Feng",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34492900/,12

154769,STINGel: Controlled release of a cyclic dinucleotide for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.,2018,"OBJECTIVES Previous studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and major depression involves an altered peripheral immune system. It is not clear, however, whether such changes are associated with corresponding neuroinflammatory responses and disturbances of neurotransmission. METHODS This paper reviews the current state of knowledge about the involvement of immune alterations in schizophrenia and major depression and a possible link to disturbances of glutamatergic transmission. RESULTS Inflammatory endogenous modulators of the NMDA receptor, the kynurenine pathway metabolites, are potential candidates for such a link. Studies of the blood and cerebrospinal fluid have suggested a schizophrenia-related upregulation of the NMDA receptor antagonist kynurenic acid in astrocytes, analogous to the ketamine psychosis model. Conversely, it has been proposed that there is depression-related microglial synthesis of the NMDA receptor agonist quinolinic acid, which is consistent with the observation that ketamine has therapeutic effects in major depression. Few publications have studied NMDA receptor modulating kynurenines in the brain, however. CONCLUSIONS Future research on the cerebral cell-type specific distribution of kynurenine metabolites and their brain-regional concentration imbalances will be required to connect peripheral immune changes, the hypotheses of blood-brain barrier dysfunction and glial pathology with concepts of altered neurotransmission in schizophrenia and major depression.","Steiner, Johann; Bogerts, Bernhard; Sarnyai, Zoltán; Walter, Martin; Gos, Tomasz; Bernstein, Hans-Gert; Myint, Aye-Mu",The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3109/15622975.2011.583941; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21707463/,12

Controversy exists, however, regarding its cost-effectiveness and its effect on postoperative outcomes. OBJECTIVES To examine the use of epidural analgesia in laparoscopic colorectal surgery at the national level and to compare its outcomes with those of conventional analgesia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is a retrospective review of laparoscopic colorectal cases performed with or without epidural analgesia for cancer, diverticular disease, and benign polyps. Patient demographic characteristics, disease and procedure types, and hospital settings were listed for patients in the epidural and conventional analgesia groups. A 1 to 4 case-matched analysis was performed, matching for patient demographic characteristics, hospital setting, indications, and procedure type. Data were obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Total hospital charge, length of stay, mortality, pneumonia, respiratory failure, urinary tract infection, urinary retention, anastomotic leak, and postoperative ileus. RESULTS A total of 191576 laparoscopic colorectal cases were identified during the study period. Epidural analgesia was used in 4102 cases (2.14%). Epidurals were more likely to be used in large teaching hospitals, cancer cases, and rectal operations. On case-matched analysis, epidural analgesia was associated with a longer hospital stay by 0.60 day (P=.003), higher hospital charges by $3732.71 (P=.02), and higher rate of urinary tract infection (odds ratio=1.81; P=.05). Epidural analgesia did not affect the incidence of respiratory failure, pneumonia, anastomotic leak, ileus, or urinary retention. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The perioperative use of epidural analgesia in laparoscopic colorectal surgery is limited in the United States. While epidural analgesia appears to be safe, it comes with higher hospital charges, longer hospital stay, and a higher incidence of urinary tract infections.","Halabi, Wissam J; Kang, Celeste Y; Nguyen, Vinh Q; Carmichael, Joseph C; Mills, Steven; Stamos, Michael J; Pigazzi, Alessio",JAMA surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamasurg.2013.3186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24336894/,12

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients were identified retrospectively from a prospectively maintained pouch database. Parameters analyzed included presenting symptoms, indications for pouch surgery, type of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, treatment modalities, and outcomes. RESULTS Of 3,176 patients who underwent ileal pouch surgery, 11 were diagnosed with pouch prolapse (0.3%). Seven had full-thickness prolapse and four mucosal prolapse. Six were male, and five were female. Indication for index surgery was ulcerative colitis (nine patients), familial adenomatous polyposis (one patient), and colonic inertia (one patient). Median age at pouch prolapse was 34 years. Median time from index surgery to prolapse diagnosis was 2 years. Two patients with mucosal prolapse responded to conservative management; two required mucosal excisions. An abdominal approach was successful in four out of seven patients with full thickness prolapse. The three failures subsequently underwent continent ileostomy formation and prompted us to add biological mesh to future pouchpexy repairs. CONCLUSIONS Pouch prolapse is rare, and there are no obvious predisposing factors. Mucosal prolapse may be treated by stool bulking or a local perineal procedure. Full thickness prolapse requires definitive surgery and is associated with risk of pouch loss.","Joyce, Myles R; Fazio, Victor W; Hull, Tracy T; Church, James; Kiran, Ravi P; Mor, Isabella; Lian, Lei; Shen, Bo; Remzi, Feza H",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-010-1194-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20393806/,12

The subgroup of external experts scored the highest (93.13-95.63), and the first subgroup, which carried out real cases, gave the lowest score (90.00-94.38). The ""think aloud"" technique found an improvement in including more diagnoses and being able to carry out several plans for one person at the same time. The usability obtained was ""excellent"" in all subgroups and questionnaires, although the application showed limitations related to its characteristics imposed in the requirements specification.","González Aguña, Alexandra; Fernández Batalla, Marta; Arias Baelo, Cristina; Monsalvo San Macario, Enrique; Gonzalo de Diego, Blanca; Santamaría García, José María","Computers, informatics, nursing : CIN",https://doi.org/10.1097/cin.0000000000000830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34570005/,12
158074,Drug Repurposing Approaches: Existing Leads For Novel Threats And Drug Targets.,2020-09-21,"OBJECTIVE Acute ischemic stroke due to proximal intracranial vessel occlusion is associated with poor prognosis and neurologic outcomes. Outcomes specifically in patients with stroke due to these occlusions and lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (0-7 range) have not been described previously. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed discharge outcomes (reported in our 'Get With the Guidelines-Stroke' database) in patients with an admission NIHSS score of 0-7 due to proximal intracranial large vessel occlusion (based on CT angiography results) who were excluded from receiving intravenous (IV) thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and endovascular intra-arterial (IA) stroke interventions. RESULTS Among the 204 patients included in our analysis, younger age and lower admission NIHSS score (0-4 range) were strong predictors of good outcome (defined as ability to ambulate independently) at discharge whereas female sex was a predictor of poor outcome. There was no significant difference between cerebrovascular risk factors, specific sites of occlusion, or presenting symptoms and outcomes at discharge. There was great variability in functional outcomes at discharge and discharge disposition (home versus acute or subacute facility or nursing home versus death/hospice) with a trend toward worse outcomes in patients with higher (5-7 range) NIHSS scores on admission. CONCLUSIONS Patients with acute stroke due to large vessel occlusion and low admission NIHSS scores (0-7 range) may have poor functional outcomes at discharge. These patients, if not eligible for IV thrombolysis, might benefit from IA revascularization therapies.","Mokin, Maxim; Masud, Muhammad W; Dumont, Travis M; Ahmad, Ghasan; Kass-Hout, Tareq; Snyder, Kenneth V; Hopkins, L Nelson; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23843443/,12

We evaluated the safety of withholding anticoagulation from pregnant women with suspected deep vein thrombosis following negative serial compression ultrasonography and iliac vein imaging. METHODS Consecutive pregnant women who presented with suspected deep vein thrombosis underwent compression ultrasonography and Doppler imaging of the iliac vein of the symptomatic leg(s). Women whose initial test results were negative underwent serial testing on 2 occasions over the next 7 days. Women not diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis were followed for a minimum of 3 months for the development of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. RESULTS In total, 221 pregnant women presented with suspected deep vein thrombosis. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 16 (7.2%) women by initial compression ultrasonography and Doppler studies; none were identified as having deep vein thrombosis on serial testing. One patient with normal serial testing had a pulmonary embolism diagnosed 7 weeks later. The overall prevalence of deep vein thrombosis was 7.7% (17/221); of these, 65% (11/17) of cases were isolated to the iliofemoral veins and 12% (2/17) were isolated iliac deep vein thromboses. The incidence of venous thromboembolism during follow-up was 0.49% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09%-2.71%). The sensitivity of serial compression ultrasonography with Doppler imaging was 94.1% (95% CI 69.2%-99.7%), the negative predictive value was 99.5% (95% CI 96.9%-100%), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.068 (95% CI 0.01-0.39). INTERPRETATION Serial compression ultrasonography with Doppler imaging of the iliac vein performed over a 7-day period excludes deep-vein thrombosis in symptomatic pregnant women.","Chan, Wee-Shian; Spencer, Frederick A; Lee, Agnes Y Y; Chunilal, Sanjeev; Douketis, James D; Rodger, Marc; Ginsberg, Jeffrey S",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.120895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23318405/,12
158985,An iron oxide nanocarrier for dsRNA to target lymph nodes and strongly activate cells of the immune system.,2014,"Mast cell (MC)-associated diseases, including allergy/anaphylaxis and neuroinflammatory pain disorders, exhibit a sex bias, with females at increase risk. While much attention has been directed toward adult sex hormones as drivers of sex differences, that female sex bias in MC-associated diseases is evident in prepubertal children, suggesting early-life origins of sex differences which have yet to be explored. Utilizing rodent models of MC-mediated anaphylaxis, our data here reveal that, 1) compared with females, males exhibit significantly reduced severity of MC-mediated anaphylactic responses that emerge prior to puberty and persist into adulthood, 2) reduced severity of MC-mediated anaphylaxis in males is linked with the naturally high level of perinatal androgens and can be recapitulated in females by perinatal exposure to testosterone proprionate, 3) perinatal androgen exposure guides bone marrow MC progenitors toward a masculinized tissue MC phenotype characterized by decreased concentration of prestored MC granule mediators (e.g., histamine, serotonin, and proteases) and reduced mediator release upon degranulation, and 4) engraftment of MC-deficient Kit W-sh/W-sh mice with adult male, female, or perinatally androgenized female MCs results in MC-mediated anaphylaxis response that reflects the MC sex and not host sex. Together, these data present evidence that sex differences in MC phenotype and resulting disease severity are established in early life by perinatal androgens. Thus, factors affecting levels of perinatal androgens could have a significant impact on MC development and MC-associated disease risk across the life span.","Mackey, Emily; Thelen, Kyan M; Bali, Vedrana; Fardisi, Mahsa; Trowbridge, Madalyn; Jordan, Cynthia L; Moeser, Adam J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1915075117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917815/,12

159598,"From Hexaphenylbenzene to 1,2,3,4,5,6-Hexacyclohexylcyclohexane.",2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND Previous narrative reviews have concluded that dietary nitrate (NO3-) improves maximal neuromuscular power in humans. This conclusion, however, was based on a limited number of studies, and no attempt has been made to quantify the exact magnitude of this beneficial effect. Such information would help ensure adequate statistical power in future studies and could help place the effects of dietary NO3- on various aspects of exercise performance (i.e., endurance vs. strength vs. power) in better context. We therefore undertook a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis to quantify the effects of NO3- supplementation on human muscle power. METHODS The literature was searched using a strategy developed by a health sciences librarian. Data sources included Medline Ovid, Embase, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov , and Google Scholar. Studies were included if they used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover experimental design to measure the effects of dietary NO3- on maximal power during exercise in the non-fatigued state and the within-subject correlation could be determined from data in the published manuscript or obtained from the authors. RESULTS Nineteen studies of a total of 268 participants (218 men, 50 women) met the criteria for inclusion. The overall effect size (ES; Hedge's g) calculated using a fixed effects model was 0.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29, 0.56; p = 6.310 × 10- 11). There was limited heterogeneity between studies (i.e., I2 = 22.79%, H2 = 1.30, p = 0.3460). The ES estimated using a random effects model was therefore similar (i.e., 0.45, 95% CI 0.30, 0.61; p = 1.064 × 10- 9). Sub-group analyses revealed no significant differences due to subject age, sex, or test modality (i.e., small vs. large muscle mass exercise). However, the ES in studies using an acute dose (i.e., 0.54, 95% CI 0.37, 0.71; p = 6.774 × 10- 12) was greater (p = 0.0211) than in studies using a multiple dose regimen (i.e., 0.22, 95% CI 0.01, 0.43; p = 0.003630). CONCLUSIONS Acute or chronic dietary NO3- intake significantly increases maximal muscle power in humans. The magnitude of this effect-on average, ~ 5%-is likely to be of considerable practical and clinical importance.","Coggan, Andrew R; Baranauskas, Marissa N; Hinrichs, Rachel J; Liu, Ziyue; Carter, Stephen J",Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-021-00463-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34625064/,12

For these jobs, centrosomes must be dynamic enough to grow, yet stable enough to resist microtubule-mediated forces. How do centrosomes achieve such seemingly contradictory features? While much is understood about the molecular parts of centrosomes, very little is known about their functional material properties. Two prevalent hypotheses pose that the centrosome is either a liquid droplet or a solid lattice. However, many material states exist between a pure Newtonian liquid and a crystalline solid, and it is not clear where centrosomes lie along this spectrum. Furthermore, broad terms like ""liquid"" or ""solid"" do not reveal functional properties like strength, ductility, elasticity, and toughness, which are more relevant to understand how centrosomes resist forces. This review covers recent findings and new rheology techniques that reveal the material characteristics of centrosomes and how they are regulated.","Woodruff, Jeffrey B",Current opinion in structural biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2020.10.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33248427/,12

METHODS Between January 2008 and December 2013, 65 consecutive patients underwent RRH during the learning period, and 60 consecutive patients underwent LRH during the experienced period. RESULTS Both groups were similar with respect to clinicopathologic characteristics. The mean operative time in the RRH group was significantly longer than that in the LRH group (277.8 ± 57.3 vs 199.6 ± 45.0 minutes; P < 0.0001). Postoperative complication rates were significantly higher in the RRH group than in the LRH group (47.7% vs 27.1%; P = 0.0188). No difference in the estimated disease-free survival rates was observed between the 2 groups (P = 0.3152); however, the estimated overall survival of RRH was lower than that of LRH with marginal significance (P = 0.0762). There was no significant difference in terms of recurrence pattern between the 2 groups (P = 0.7041). However, peritoneal recurrences occurred only in the RRH group. CONCLUSIONS Despite RRH being performed by an experienced laparoscopic oncologist, RRH showed inferior long-term oncological outcomes and postoperative complication rates compared with those of LRH during the learning period.","Chong, Gun Oh; Lee, Yoon Hee; Lee, Hyun Jung; Hong, Dae Gy; Lee, Yoon Soon",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0000000000001172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29303929/,12

However, previous studies have not explored the heterogeneous impacts of high-tech industry on CO2 emissions in regions with different levels of high-tech industry development, and not distinguished the direct and indirect impacts. Based on STIRPAT model, this study investigates the impacts of high-tech industry development on CO2 emissions in China between 2005 and 2016. Adopting the K-medians cluster method, effects in regions with high, middle, and low levels of high-tech industry development are considered. Indirect effects of high-tech industry development on CO2 emissions by affecting industry structure upgrades and economic growth are explored. Empirical results illustrate a positive U-shaped nonlinear link between the level of high-tech industry development and CO2 emissions at the national level and regional (high, middle, and low) level. In terms of indirect impacts, high-tech industry development attenuates the reduction of CO2 emissions due to industry structure upgrades, and promotes economic growth to increase CO2 emissions slightly. The indirect impact intensity gradually decreases as the level of high-tech industry development decreases across three regions. Reasonable implications of our findings are proposed.","Gu, Wei; Liu, Di; Wang, Chen; Dai, Shufen; Zhang, Donghui",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09071-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388753/,12

Objectives To determine the rate and indications for caesarean deliveries with a view to improving on the service delivery in the study area. Methods A retrospective review of all caesarean deliveries over a five-year period, January 1st, 2012 to December 31st, 2016. Results A total of 2321 deliveries were recorded during the study duration and 481 of them were through caesarean section (CS) giving a caesarean section rate of 20.4%. The rate was higher in the multigravida 255 (53.1%). The commonest indication for caesarean section was previous caesarean section 131 (27.2%). Emergency caesarean delivery accounted for 278 (57.8%). Only 16 (3.3%) stayed more than five days postoperatively while the rest, 465 (96.7%), stayed less than five days. There was a gradual yearly increase in rate from 12.1% in 2012 to 19.5% in 2016. Conclusion The rate of CS in this study has shown a gradual yearly increase with emergency CS having a higher percentage. Early diagnosis and referral of high-risk pregnancies from peripheral hospitals could reduce emergency CS among the study population.","Ismail, Waheed O; Bello, Ibrahim S; Olowookere, Samuel A; Ibrahim, Azeez O; Agbesanwa, Tosin A; Adekunle, Wulaimat A",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v21i1.41; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394313/,12

Despite this, the initial step of recipient hepatectomy has not been the focus of clinical research thus far. Due to advanced coagulopathy in liver transplant recipients, this part of the operation still carries the risk of severe hemorrhage. This trial is designed to compare an electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing device (LigaSure™) and an ultrasound dissector (HARMONIC ACE®+7) with standard surgical techniques during the recipients' hepatectomy in liver transplantation. METHODS/DESIGN In a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel, three-armed, confirmatory, open trial, LigaSure™ and HARMONIC ACE®+7 will be compared with standard surgical techniques that use titanium clips and conventional knot-tying ligations during recipient hepatectomy in liver transplantation. Intraoperative total blood loss is the primary endpoint of the trial. Secondary endpoints include blood loss during hepatectomy, the duration of both the hepatectomy and the entire surgical procedure, and blood transfusion requirements of the procedure. To generate reliable data, intraoperative blood loss will be recorded with respect to all rinse fluids during surgery, ascites, and by weighing used swabs. At 80% power and an alpha of 0.025 for both of the experimental groups, 23 subjects will be analyzed per protocol in each study arm in order to detect clinically relevant reduction of intraoperative blood loss. The intention-to-treat analysis will include 69 patients. The follow-up period for each patient will be 90 days for safety reasons, whereas all clinical outcomes will be measured within the first 10 postoperative days. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this is the first prospective, randomized trial comparing two innovative technical methods of vessel sealing and dissection with standard techniques for recipient hepatectomy. This will be done to detect relevant reduction of intraoperative blood loss during liver transplant. The results of the trial are expected to improve patient outcome and safety after liver transplant and to increase the general safety of this procedure.

An increasing number of reports describe some of these characteristics in this age range. A non-systematic review was undertaken using MEDLINE (PubMed), LILACS (VHL), Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane and CAPES Portal databases from 1 January until 30 September 2020 [103] with the search terms SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, child, children, youth, adolescent and newborn to identify the more recent clinical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. In general, SARS-CoV-2 infection in children tends to be asymptomatic or to have mild or moderate signs, and most young ones are infected by family members. Recent reports offer new insights into the disease. Current evidence on SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents is presented, especially concerning the clinical presentation, imaging and uncommon severe forms of the disease, particularly the COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome.

It spread very rapidly, and on March 11th of 2020, the outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Currently, effective treatment options remain limited. SARS-CoV-2 enzyme main protease (MPRO) plays a pivotal role in the viral life cycle, making it a putative drug target. In order to identify suitable hits to develop inhibitors with adequate antiviral properties, we explored the LASSBio Chemical Library employing multiple strategies of virtual screening. A fragment-based pharmacophore model enabled the identification of key interactions involved in the molecular recognition at the catalytic site of MPRO, namely, with amino acid residues His41, His163 and Glu166. Docking-based virtual screening was performed, leading to the identification of LASSBio-1945 (9), a new hit of MPRO, presenting an IC50 = 15.97 μM. This compound, an 1,3-benzodioxolyl sulfonamide, represents an interesting starting point for subsequent hit-to-lead optimization steps and, to the best of our knowledge, a new distinct chemotype for MPRO inhibition.","Franco, Lucas S; Maia, Rodolfo C; Barreiro, Eliezer J",RSC medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0md00282h; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046603/,12

IU has been reliably associated with disrupted threat extinction. However, it remains unclear whether IU would be related to disrupted extinction to other arousing stimuli that are not threatening (i.e., rewarding). We addressed this question by conducting a Pavlovian reward conditioning task with acquisition and extinction training phases (n = 58). In the Pavlovian reward conditioning task, we recorded liking ratings, skin conductance response (SCR), and corrugator supercilii activity (i.e. brow muscle indicative or negative and positive affect) to learned reward (CS+) and neutral (CS-) cues. Typical patterns of reward acquisition and extinction training were observed for liking ratings. There was evidence for conditioning in SCR during the extinction training phase but not the acquisition training phase. However, no evidence of conditioning in either the acquisition or extinction training phase was observed for the corrugator supercilii. IU was not related to any measures during the acquisition or extinction training phases. Taken together, these results suggest that the current Pavlovian reward conditioning task was not sufficient for eliciting a reliable conditioned reward response, and therefore further research with optimised reward conditioning designs are required to test whether IU-related deficits occur during the extinction of reward.","Morriss, Jayne; Biagi, Nicolo; Lonsdorf, Tina B; Andreatta, Marta",The European journal of neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.15173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33675550/,12

METHODS Studies that compared neurocognitive outcomes of paediatric patients with TBI and controls were searched using Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, between January 1988 and August 2019. We presented a random-effects model, stratified by TBI severity, time of assessment post injury and age. RESULTS Of 5919 studies, 41 (patients=3717) and 33 (patients=3118) studies were included for the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. Studies mostly measured mild TBI (n=26, patients=2888) at 0-3 months postinjury (n=17, patients=2502). At 0-3 months postinjury, standardised mean differences between TBI and controls for executive function were -0.04 (95% CI -0.14 to 0.07; I2=0.00%), -0.18 (95% CI -0.29 to -0.06; I2=26.1%) and -0.95 (95% CI -1.12 to -0.77; I2=10.1%) for mild, moderate and severe TBI, respectively; a similar effect was demonstrated for learning and memory. Severe TBI had the worst outcomes across all domains and persisted >24 months postinjury. Commonly used domains differed largely from workgroup recommendations. Risk of bias was acceptable for all included studies. CONCLUSION A dose-dependent relationship between TBI severity and neurocognitive outcomes was evident in executive function and in learning and memory. Cognitive deficits were present for TBIs of all severity but persisted among children with severe TBI. The heterogeneity of neurocognitive scales makes direct comparison between studies difficult. Future research into lesser explored domains and a more detailed assessment of neurocognitive deficits in young children are required to better understand the true burden of paediatric TBI.","Goh, Mark Sen Liang; Looi, Dawn Shu Hui; Goh, Jia Ling; Sultana, Rehena; Goh, Sharon Si Min; Lee, Jan Hau; Chong, Shu-Ling","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2020-325066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789922/,12
161810,ABO blood group is a predictor of survival in patients undergoing surgery for renal cell carcinoma.,2012,"BACKGROUND The efficacy of flow diverters is dependent upon robust wall apposition in the parent artery. Usage in large caliber cerebral vessels has therefore been limited as few implants with diameters > 5 mm exist. We present our initial experience in treating cerebral aneurysms using the 5.5 mm and 6 mm diameter implants of the Derivo embolization device (DED). METHODS Our prospectively maintained institutional database was reviewed to identify patients in whom a > 5 mm DED was implanted between November 2016 and February 2021. The primary efficacy outcome was complete or near-complete aneurysm occlusion at 6 months (O'Kelly-Marotta, OKM, C-D, adapted for magnetic resonance angiography). Safety outcomes included 30-day major morbidity defined as modified Rankin Score (mRS) 3-5, mortality, serious adverse events and procedural complications. RESULTS A total of 21 large diameter DEDs were deployed in 18 patients (age 59.5 ± 14.1 years), harboring 19 unruptured aneurysms. Of the aneurysms 14 (73.7%) were saccular in morphology (sac diameter 10.9 ± 5.5 mm, neck diameter 6.8 ± 3.1 mm), 3 (15.8%) aneurysms were dissecting, 1 (5.3%) iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm and 1 (5.3%) fusiform. Aneurysm locations were: ICA (internal carotid artery) (n = 17); (7 cavernous, 4 paraophthalmic, 2 paraclinoid, 1 petrous, 2 communicating, 1 cervical); vertebrobasilar (n = 2). Adjunct stenting to optimize proximal wall apposition was undertaken in 5 (27.8%) patients. At 6 months 75% of patients followed-up met the primary efficacy endpoint (OKM C-D). There were no serious adverse events, 30-day major morbidity (mRS 3-5) or mortality. CONCLUSION Implantation of large diameter (5.5 mm and 6 mm) DEDs into capacious cerebral vessels to treat a range of complex aneurysms is safe and technically feasible but may require adjunct stenting to optimize proximal wall apposition. Short-term efficacy of this device subset is comparable to previous DED and other flow diverter studies. Long-term follow-up and comparative studies are required for further assessment.","Butt, Waleed; Kim, Cha-Ney; Ramaswamy, Rajesh; Smith, Aubrey; Maliakal, Paul",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-021-01086-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34498094/,12

Due to increasing availability of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) equipment in the operating room, there is a widespread interest in its usefulness for intraoperative diagnosis of hypotension as an alternative to transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the utility of intraoperative FoCUS to assess patients experiencing unexplained hypotension while undergoing noncardiac surgery. We performed a systematic literature search of multiple publication databases for studies that evaluated the utility of intraoperative FoCUS for assessment and management of unexplained hypotension in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, including retro- and prospective clinical studies. A summary of the study findings, study quality, and assessment of level of evidence is presented. We identified 2227 unique articles from the literature search, of which 27 were potentially relevant, and 9 were included in this review. The number of patients pooled from these studies was 255, of whom 228 had intraoperative diagnoses with the aid of intraoperative FoCUS. The level of evidence of all studies included was very low according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines. This systematic review has demonstrated that FoCUS may be a useful, noninvasive method to differentiate causes of intraoperative hypotension and guide correcting interventions, although the quality of evidence is very low. Further prospective high-quality studies are needed to investigate whether intraoperative FoCUS has a diagnostic utility that is associated with improved outcomes.","Navas-Blanco, Jose R; Louro, Jack; Reynolds, John; Epstein, Richard H; Dudaryk, Roman",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000005336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33346986/,12
162117,Quantitative Modeling Extends the Antibacterial Activity of Nitric Oxide.,2020,"The trend of regenerative therapy for diabetes in human and veterinary practices has conceptually been proven according to the Edmonton protocol and animal models. Establishing an alternative insulin-producing cell (IPC) resource for further clinical application is a challenging task. This study investigated IPC generation from two practical canine mesenchymal stem cells (cMSCs), canine bone marrow-derived MSCs (cBM-MSCs) and canine adipose-derived MSCs (cAD-MSCs). The results illustrated that cBM-MSCs and cAD-MSCs contain distinct pancreatic differentiation potential and require the tailor-made induction protocols. The effective generation of cBM-MSC-derived IPCs needs the integration of genetic and microenvironment manipulation using a hanging-drop culture of PDX1-transfected cBM-MSCs under a three-step pancreatic induction protocol. However, this protocol is resource- and time-consuming. Another study on cAD-MSC-derived IPC generation found that IPC colonies could be obtained by a low attachment culture under the three-step induction protocol. Further, Notch signaling inhibition during pancreatic endoderm/progenitor induction yielded IPC colonies through the trend of glucose-responsive C-peptide secretion. Thus, this study showed that IPCs could be obtained from cBM-MSCs and cAD-MSCs through different induction techniques. Also, further signaling manipulation studies should be conducted to maximize the protocol's efficiency.","Rodprasert, Watchareewan; Nantavisai, Sirirat; Pathanachai, Koranis; Pavasant, Prasit; Osathanon, Thanaphum; Sawangmake, Chenphop",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91774-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117315/,12

However, because the household is generally considered a private sphere, violence between family members remains neglected. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify predictors of household violence in humanitarian emergencies. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from January 1, 1998, to February 16, 2016. A predictor was defined as any individual, household, or community-level exposure that increases or decreases the risk associated with physical, sexual, or emotional interpersonal violence between two or more people living together. All studies reporting on quantitative research were eligible for inclusion. Results were analyzed using qualitative synthesis. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed as applicable. The search strategy resulted in 2,587 original records, of which 33 studies met inclusion criteria. Thirty-two of the 33 studies used a cross-sectional design. This was the first known systematic review of predictors of household violence in humanitarian settings. The household framework drew attention to several factors that are associated with violence against both women and children, including conflict exposure, alcohol and drug use, income/economic status, mental health/coping strategies, and limited social support. There is a need for longitudinal research and experimental designs that can better establish temporality between exposures and household violence outcomes, control for confounding, and inform practice. In the interim, programmers and policy makers should try to leverage the predictors identified by this review for integrated violence prevention and response strategies, with the important caveat that ongoing evaluation of such strategies is needed.","Rubenstein, Beth L; Lu, Lily Zhi Ning; MacFarlane, Matthew; Stark, Lindsay","Trauma, violence & abuse",https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838017738724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29334000/,12

Given the burden of cancer and other chronic disease diseases along with demographic changes, the need for palliative care is growing in Turkey. This study aimed to review of the available scientific literature on palliative cancer care needs, models and outcomes Turkey. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted with English and Turkish keywords in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Google Scholar, The Turkish Academic Network and Information Centre databases, Turkish Ministry of Health documents, Turkish Council of Higher Education's doctoral thesis, and renowned national and international palliative care as well as cancer conferences 01/ 2000 to 07/ 2020. Results: Out of 27489 papers identified, 320 met the criteria for inclusion. The main focus of these studies was;historical development in palliative care, legislative regulation, professional training, use of opioids, symptom management, care for patients, palliative care centers, public awareness, psychosocial support, and end of life ethics. The majority of this literature used descriptive design, although a few case-control, cohort, and randomized control trials were also found. Our analysis showed that the development of PC in Turkey can be divided into three period. The first (early initiatives, before 2000), the second (dissemination phase, 2000- 2010), and the third stage (government & societial engagement, after 2010). Several studies also analyzed the barriers such as low public & professional awareness, disconnection from cancer care, the opioidfobia and the lack of trained palliative care providers. The lack of integration of palliative care to cancer care is a major challenge for palliative care implementation. Conclusions: This review presents the evidence of the significant progress in PC during the last 20 years and the opportunities for further progress. Bringing research into practice is needed for shaping the integration of palliative care to cancer care in Turkey. The stakeholders and policy makers should not neglect the need for PC under the current pressure of COVID-19 pandemic on health and economy.","Kutluk, M.

164641,Elevated levels of interleukin-27 in early life compromise protective immunity during neonatal sepsis,2019-09-20,"Background: Despite the considerable research efforts being made to learn more about COVID-19, little is known about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in biological fluids other than respiratory droplets, blood, and feces 1,2. In particular, little is known about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the joints either post mortem 3 or in vivo 4. To the best of our knowledge, only Lopéz-Gonzalez et al.5 have published a description of acute arthritides occurring during hospitalisation due to COVID-19, and they did not find any SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in the patients' synovial fluid samples. Objectives: The aim of this post mortem study was to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the knee synovial fluid, synovial tissue, and bone tissue of COVID-19 patients in order to discover whether the joint is a possible route of transmission during orthopaedic surgical procedures, and clarify the possible role of SARS-CoV-2 as a directly arthritogenic virus. Methods: Post mortem synovial fluid, synovial tissue and bone tissue samples were collected from the knees of five patients who died of COVID-19 in our hospital between September and October 2020, and analysed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using a commercial real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) panel. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to test post mortem nasopharyngeal swabs of all of the patients. Results: No SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in any of the knee samples, despite the positivity of the throat swab. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in knee synovial fluid, synovial membrane or bone. Therefore, our results suggest that all healthcare professionals performing surgical procedures on the joints of COVID-19 patients are exposed to a risk of contagion due to exposure to respiratory droplets, blood and body fluids, but not to direct exposure to joint-or bone-related tissues. Furthermore, given that some case reports of arthritis in COVID-19 patients 5-8 show that it is possible that COVID-19 patients display viral-mediated arthralgias and arthritis, the absence of the virus in the knee highlighted by our study suggests that it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 has a direct inflammatory action on the joint, but it could induce an inflammation-related reaction, manifesting as a reactive arthritis 9.","Grassi, M.; Giorgi, V.; Nebuloni, M.; Zerbi, P.; Gismondo, M.

It was suggested that COVID-19 will lead to an increased delirium burden in its acute phase, with variable effect on mental health in the longer term. Despite this, there are limited data on the direct effects of the pandemic on psychiatric care.Objectives1) describe the mental health presentations of a diverse acute inpatient population, 2) compare findings with the same period in 2019, 3) characterise the SARS-CoV-2 positive cohort of patients.MethodsWe present a descriptive summary of the referrals to a UK psychiatric liaison department during the exponential phase of the pandemic, and compare this to the same period in 2019.Resultsshow a 40.3% reduction in the number of referrals in 2020, with an increase in the proportion of referrals for delirium and psychosis. One third (28%) of referred patients tested positive for COVID-19 during their admission, with 39.7% of these presenting with delirium as a consequence of their COVID-19 illness. Our data indicate decreased clinical activity for our service during the pandemic’s peak. There was a marked increase in delirium, though in no other psychiatric presentations.ConclusionsIn preparation for further exponential rises in COVID-19 cases, we would expect seamless integration of liaison psychiatry teams in general hospital wards to optimise delirium management in patients with COVID-19. Further consideration should be given to adequate staffing of community and crisis mental health teams to safely manage the potentially increasing number of people reluctant to visit the emergency department.","Butler, M.; Delvi, A.; Mujic, F.; Broad, S.; Pauli, L.; Pollak, T.; Gibbs, S.; Lam, C.

This study focused on two viral proteases namely main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-2) to identify which of these are essential for viral replication. We screened 102 secondary metabolites against SARS-CoV-2 isolated from 36 terrestrial plants and 36 marine organisms from Indonesian biodiversity. These organisms are typically presumed to have antiviral effects, and some of them have been used as an immunomodulatory activity in traditional medicine. For the molecular docking procedure to obtain Gibbs free energy value (AG), toxicity, ADME and Lipinski, AutoDock Vina was used. In this study, five secondary metabolites, namely co-rilagin, dieckol, phlorofucofuroeckol A, proanthocyanidins, and isovitexin, were found to inhibit ACE-2, Mpro, and PLpro receptors in SARS-CoV-2, with a high affinity to the same sites of ptilidepsin, remdesivir, and chloroquine as the control molecules. This study was delimited to molecular docking without any validation by simulations concerned with molecular dynamics. The interactions with two viral proteases and human ACE-2 may play a key role in developing antiviral drugs for five active compounds. In future, we intend to investigate antiviral drugs and the mechanisms of action by in vitro study.","Syahputra, G.; Gustini, N.; Bustanussalam, B.; Hapsari, Y.; Sari, M.; Ardiansyah, A.; Bayu, A.; Putra, M.

One of the changes is the work and family dynamics. Based on boundary theory we examine the mediated role of work and family balance and boundary segmentation behavior in the relationship between boundary violations and teleworkers’ stress and well-being. However, because women and men live their work and family differently, gender may condition the way teleworkers lead with boundary violations and boundary segmentation. Hypotheses were tested through moderated mediation modeling using data collected of 456 teleworkers during lockdown. In line with our expectations, teleworkers who have suffered most boundary violations were those with least boundary segmentation behaviors and with least work-family balance which, in turn was related to higher burnout and lower flourishing. Furthermore, gender was found to moderate the relationship between boundary violations from work-to-family and segmentation behavior in the same direction and this relationship was stronger for females than for males. We discuss implications for future research and for managing teleworkers, creating sustainability, both during a crise and stable days.","Santos, Alda Ribeiro Maria Teresa",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137339,12

We sought to study the delays faced by the cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of measures carried out to reduce the delays. METHODS: We carried out a review of inpatient and outpatient oncology services from March 15 to June 15, 2020, at our institution. We obtained data on delays in referrals, diagnosis, chemotherapy, and treatment delivery for cancer patients. To examine the delays, patients were assessed in the inpatient and outpatient settings and according to cancer types. RESULTS: A total of 505 patients' events were included in the study, with 136 referral delays, 167 diagnostic delays, 121 chemotherapy delays, and 81 treatment delays. In the outpatient settings, maximum referral delays were faced by breast cancer patients (9.5 ± 3.3 days, range 7-14), followed by hematologic malignancy (hematology) patients (8.4 ± 4.5 days, range 0-14). Maximum diagnosis delay was faced by hematology patients (11.75 ± 5 days, range 0-14), followed by breast cancer patients (11.2 ± 3.4 days, range 7-14). Breast and colorectal cancer patients faced maximum chemotherapy delays (9.5 ± 6.6 days, range 0-14), followed by hematology patients (7.3 ± 6.6 days, range 0-14). In the inpatient setting, maximum diagnosis delays were faced by hematology patients (11 ± 2 days, range 10-14), followed by gastrointestinal cancers (8 ± 2.4 days, range 5-10). Maximum chemotherapy delays were faced by hematology patients (8.5 ± 5.9 days, range 0-14) and breast cancer patients (8 ± 2.4 days, range 5-10). Hematology patients were most affected by treatment-delays (6.75 ± 4.7 days, range 0-10). Comparison of delays during the earlier part of the study with the later part showed that referral delays improved by 3.5 days (P = 0.02), diagnosis delays improved by 6.1 days (P < 0.001), chemotherapy delays improved by 7.7 days (P < 0.001), and treatment delays improved by 8 days (P < 0.001).

171930,Functional interaction between Drosophila olfactory sensory neurons and their support cells,2021-10-04,"Emotion processing has been a focus of research in psychology and neuroscience for some decades. While the evoked neural markers in human brain activations in response to different emotions have been reported, the temporal dynamics of emotion processing has received less attention. Differences in processing speeds, that depend on emotion type, have not been determined. Furthermore, behavioral studies have found that the right side of the human face expresses emotions more accurately than the left side. Therefore, accounting for both the content of the emotion and the visual angle of presentation from the perspective of the viewer, here we have investigated variability in the discrimination of happy and sad faces when the visual angle of presentation was Positive (right side of the face) compared to Negative (left side of the face). Furthermore, the temporal dynamics involved in processing happy and sad emotions have been compared. Regardless of visual angle, happy emotions were processed faster than sad emotions. However, the evoked response to sad emotions significantly increased in amplitude compared to that for happy emotions, when faces were presented at Positive visual angles only. Source reconstruction from sensor-level ERFs show localized activities in ventral and dorsal stream, including fusiform gyrus, lingual gyrus, putamen and Pre and Post central gyrus. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) confirmed these findings – demonstrating successful decoding of happy and sad emotions only occurred when the facial expression was viewed from a positive visual angle, and that happy emotions were processed faster than sad emotions.","Nara, Sanjeev; Rathee, Dheeraj; Molinaro, Nicola; Bois, Naomi Du; Bhushan, Braj; Prasad, Girijesh",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.443280,12

Other objectives included study on effects of free and encapsulated forms of probiotics when incorporated in fruit juices on their survivability, storage stability and physiological and functional characteristics in host cells under gastric and intestinal conditions. Results and Conclusion: Studies have shown that lactobacilli strains are verified strains for producing probiotic supplements, including juices. Various methods have been suggested to improve survivability of probiotics. Encapsulation can protect probiotics against physical characteristics of juices and hence bacterial physiological damages under anaerobic conditions. Several methods have been used to encapsulate probiotics, each of them has shown distinct characteristics.

The aim of the article is to understand the role patronage plays in Africa from the perspective of a relevant African hermeneutic. Like many studies undertaken in an African setting, it uses a comparative methodology to create a dialogue between a socio-historical textual analysis of the biblical text and the socio-economic and religio-cultural realities of African contexts. It specifically uses an analogical paradigm that compares the reception of the biblical tradition in a specific historical critical context to its reception in modern-day African contexts. The result of the comparison is that the misuse of patronage is engaged from the perspective of the response of early Christian writers to patronage in the 1st century. This initial exploration has indicated that an analogous comparative approach has the potential to provide deeper insights in understanding the relationship established by patronage in African contexts. The conclusion is that in its engagement with patronage in Africa, the church must encourage its members to ask if it establishes parasitic or exploitative relations, if it is beneficial to the whole society over an extended period of time and if a clear distinction is made between public (offices) and personal resources. Ultimately, it needs to be asked if benefaction reflects the will of God and enhances the reputation of the congregation of God. Contribution: The contribution of the article is in clarifying the potential analogical comparisons for studying the Bible in Africa and for the formulation of a critical African ethic.","Nel, M.

176401,An operationally implementable model for predicting the effects of an infectious disease on a comprehensive regional healthcare system,2021-07-22,"Risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia are associated with higher rates of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Little is known about clinical outcomes in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) hospitalized with COVID-19. We sought to investigate the clinical predictors and hospital outcomes. Data were collected from 321 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at two affiliate hospitals between Jan 1 and July 31, 2020. Patients were identified as having MetS by meeting three of the five standard criteria on hospital admission. Among 321 patients (median age 67 years), 50.3% were female, and 48% had MetS. MetS patients had a higher prevalence of diabetes (64 vs. 9%), hypertension (64 vs. 30%), hyperlipidemia (57 vs. 22%), CAD (26 vs. 13%) and CKD (32 vs. 16%), P<0.001. MetS patients also had higher systolic blood pressure (131 vs. 124 mmHg), TGs (147 vs. 91 mg/dl) and lower HDL (41 vs. 64 mg/dl), p<0.05. MetS was significantly associated with multiple adverse clinical outcomes (Fig1). Cardiac arrest was higher in MetS patients (OR 2.12 [CI 0.871-5.141]) but was not statistically significant. We observed that MetS in hospitalized COVID-19 patients increased the odds of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, ARDS diagnosis and hospital readmission at 30 days. Higher mortality was thus more common in MetS compared to patients without MetS.","Pereira, Leanne Namdarizandi Vahid Kasan Shalemar Ann Fatuyi Michael Tappuni Bassman Kaseer Belal Brandt Dominique M.; Shemisa, Kamal Elabidin Awfa Zain Sharma Vivek",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-296-or,12
176971,The evolution of knowledge on genes associated with human diseases,2021-06-21,"The study aimed to assess the clinical course and risk factors for adverse outcomes, as well as the treatment options for COVID-19 in renal transplant recipient (RTR). Patients and methods: a retrospective study included 279 RTRs (M 60.9%, age 49.9±10.9 years), infected with SARS-CoV-2 from 01.04.2020 to 30.11.2020. After confirmation of COVID-19 by PCR and chest CT, MMF/Aza were canceled. In severe cases, the CNI dose was minimized while that of CS was increased. Observation endpoints: hospital discharge/recovery or death. Results: SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 84.2% of RTRs. In almost 90% of patients, the COVID-19 was confirmed by CT data. Duration after transplantation at the time of infection was 54.0 (14.0;108.0) months, in 17.6% of cases it was 6 months or less. 223/79.9% RTRs were treated in the hospital. The period from the onset of the disease to the hospitalization was 6.8±4.5 days. Severe lung damage (&gt;50%) occurred in 43.1% RTRs;45.3% of patients required respiratory support. Hospital mortality was 13.9%, overall mortality was 11.1%. The most common cause of death (93.5%) was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The risk factors associated with an unfavorable outcome were a high comorbidity index, the severity of the pulmonary lesion, the degree of graft dysfunction at the onset of the disease, decreased SpO2 and the use of mechanical ventilation, as well as anemia, leukocytosis, lymphocytopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, increased levels of creatinine, AST, CRP, LDH, and D-dimer, interleukin-6 and procalcitonin. Scr during the course of the disease increased from 171.6±78.0 μM to 221.5±121.3 μM (p&lt;0.01) with no signs of acute rejection. In 2 recipients with severe graft failure at the time of infection with SARS-CoV-2, HD was resumed from the moment of hospitalization. We were unable to identify the effect of hydroxychloroquine on the outcome of COVID-19. At the same time, mortality in patients with hydroxychloroquine use was higher than in recipients treated with immunobiological drugs: 25.6% and 11.4%, respectively, p&lt;0.02. When immunomodulators were combined with dexamethasone, mortality decreased to 4.8%. The independent factors of adverse outcome were high levels of procalcitonin (p&lt;0.019) and mechanical ventilation (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: COVID-19 in RTRs is characterized by a severe course and high mortality, which necessitates hospitalization of the majority of infected patients. An increase in procalcitonin levels and the need for mechanical ventilation were independent predictors of an unfavorable outcome of COVID-19. © 2021 JSC Vidal Rus. All rights reserved.","Kim, I.

177491,Is innate immunity our best weapon for flattening the curve?,2020,"Following a successful vaccination campaign at the beginning of 2021 in Israel, where approximately 60% of the population were vaccinated with an mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, it seemed that Israel had crossed the herd immunity threshold (HIT). Nonetheless, Israel has seen a steady rise in COVID-19 morbidity since June 2021, reaching over 1,000 cases per million by August. This outbreak is attributed to several events that came together: the temporal decline of the vaccine's efficacy (VE); lower efficacy of the vaccine against the current Delta (B.1.617.2) variant; highly infectiousness of Delta; and temporary halt of mandated NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions) or any combination of the above. Using a novel spatial-dynamic model and recent aggregate data from Israel, we examine the extent of the impact of the Delta variant on morbidity and whether it can solely explain the outbreak. We conclude that both Delta infectiousness and waning immunity could have been able to push Israel above the HIT independently, and thus, to mitigate the outbreak effective NPIs are required. Our analysis cautions countries that once vaccines' will wane a highly infectious spread is expected, and therefore, the expected decline in the vaccine's effectiveness in those countries should be accompanied by another vaccination campaign and effective NPIs","De-Leon, H.; Aran, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.12.21263451v1?rss=1,12

Country reports are compiled by national governments, but civil society plays an important role to expose discrepancies in country reports through shadow reports. Women's organisations and other stakeholders in the struggle for gender justice therefore act as a corrective to official views of the state of gender equality/justice in countries. Ilitha Labantu, a South African women's rights organisation, organised a South African consultative forum in 2020 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Beijing conference and reflect on what progress has still to be made, particularly foregrounding the younger generation of feminist leadership in 2020. An objective of the gathering was to provide a forum for women to share their experiences of the struggle for gender equality across generations and to make recommendations on the six action coalitions identified by the Beijing +25 UN Generation Equality campaign to catalyse and drive action and new commitment to gender equality. The consultative meeting was held in preparation for the sixty fourth session of the United Nation's Convention on the Status of Women (UN CSW64), where civil society feedback and discussion were derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The reportback focusses on the meeting's deliberations on youth recommendations on the action coalition themes: gender-based violence;economic justice and rights;bodily autonomy and sexual and reproductive health and rights;feminist action for climate change;technology and innovation for gender equality;and feminist movements and leadership, that will include handing over of the reins to a younger generation of feminists. Recommendations included a greater space for the inclusion of a younger generation of feminists in the Beijing +25 processes through the use of modern digital technologies, a focus on intersectionality and tackling patriarchal attitudes that impede progress toward gender equality.","Labantu, I.",Agenda-Empowering Women for Gender Equity,https://doi.org/10.1080/10130950.2021.1930884,12

This study aims to draw on the role theory to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women's work–family balance during the lockdown.Design/methodology/approachThe current COVID-19 pandemic, which has altered the ways in which we live and work, requires specific methodological tools to be understood. The authors, therefore, opted for an interpretive–constructivist and constructivist–phenomenologist approach. The dataset, thus, comprises of semi-structured interviews with 26 working women in the UK.FindingsThe findings illustrate how the COVID-19 lockdown has intensified British women's domestic workload and has, thus, caused unbridled role conflict, which has further been exacerbated by structural and interactional roles undertaken by women, especially during the lockdown. Remote working has contributed to women's role congestion and role conflict and poses severe challenges to role differentiation. Furthermore, we found that the lockdown has facilitated the rediscovery of family values and closeness, which is connected to the decline in juvenile delinquency and low crime rate that has resulted from the lockdown.Originality/valueThrough the lens of the role theory, this study concludes that the cohabitation of work and family duties within the domestic space undermines the ability to achieve work–family balance and role differentiation due to the occurrence of inter-role conflicts. This study enriches our understanding of the effect of remote working on female employees' work–family balance during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.","Toyin Ajibade, Adisa Aiyenitaju Opeoluwa Olatunji David Adekoya",Journal of Work-Applied Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/jwam-07-2020-0036,12

Within the framework of this article, the authors developed an interdisciplinary concept of the concept of stress resistance, which is most fully manifested during periods of global crises such as the economic transition to Industry 4.0 and the COVID-19 pandemic, and also made an attempt to form indicators for assessing the stress resistance of regions in the new economic and socio-political realities. The problem of stress resistance is becoming especially relevant for the resource regions of Russia. The concept of stress resistance is studied from the standpoint of economic and socio-political approaches. Within the framework of this article, under the concept of resistance to stress, the authors consider the state of stability of all levels of government in relation to stressful situations in the economic, social and political spheres of society, as well as the ability to develop adaptive mechanisms based on forms of strategic partnership between the state and society, in particular civil society institutions. The aim of the study was to develop the main risk factors and factors-stabilizers of stress resistance at the regional level in the context of the global crisis, influencing the system of interaction between government institutions and society. The factors-stabilizers of stress resistance at the regional level are distinguished. Taking into account Industry 4.0 and COVID-19 in the Russian Federation, such “points of growth” may be changes in the modernization of medicine, support from the state for business and non-governmental organizations. Measures to provide stabilization measures to support various categories of the population were taken as a “point”, but quite justified measure to support the economic level of development of regional economies and stabilize the situation in the social sphere.","Goosen, E.

In Japan, states of emergency have been declared in specific prefectures to reduce public movement and control COVID-19 transmission. We investigated how familiarity with the COVID-19 infection affected self-restraint related to outing behaviors during state of emergency declarations in Japan. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted among workers aged 20-65 years using data from an internet survey. The baseline survey was conducted on December 22-25, 2020, and a follow-up survey was on February 18-19, 2021. There were 19,941 participants who completed both surveys and were included in the final analysis. We set self-restraint regarding outing behaviors after the second state of emergency was declared in January 2021 as the dependent variable, and levels of familiarity with COVID-19 infection as independent variables. Odds ratios were estimated using multilevel logistic analyses. Results: Significant differences by familiarity with COVID-19 infection were identified: compared with people without a history of COVID-19 or close contact with cases of confirmed COVID-19, and those whose acquaintances had not been diagnosed with COVID-19, people with a history of COVID-19 did not refrain from most outing behaviors. People with an acquaintance diagnosed with COVID-19 were significantly more likely to refrain from most outing behaviors. There was no significant difference in any outing behavior for people with a history of close contact only. Conclusions: To maximize the effect of emergency declarations, health authorities should disseminate information for each person in the target population, taking into account potential differences related to the familiarity with the infection.","MORI, T.; Nagata, T.; Ikegami, K.; Hino, A.; Tateishi, S.; Tsuji, M.; Matsuda, S.; Fujino, Y.; Mori, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.20.21262364v1?rss=1,12

However, given the dynamic landscape of tRNA pools among tissues, it is unclear whether different viruses infecting different tissues have adapted their codon usage toward their tropism. Here, we collect the coding sequences of over 500 human-infecting viruses and determine that tropism explains changes in codon usage. Using an in silico model of translational efficiency, we validate the correspondence of the viral codon usage with the translational machinery of their tropism. In particular, we propose that the improved translational adaptation to the upper respiratory airways of the pandemic agent SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus could enhance its transmissibility. Furthermore, this correspondence is specifically defined in early viral proteins, as upon infection cells undergo reprogramming of tRNA pools that favors the translation of late counterparts.","Hernandez-Alias, Xavier; Schaefer, Martin H.; Serrano, Luis",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.027557,12

182816,An evolutionary change in diagnostic virology.,1989,"A brief history of the human coronaviruses (HCoVs) tells us that they are inherently zoonotic in origin. The molecular analysis of these HCoVs revealed a large genome of approximately 30 kb that encodes for a fixed subset of structural proteins, non-structural proteins, and varied accessory proteins. Additionally, the HCoV genomes have a prerequisite ability to undergo mutation and recombination that fosters advantageous gene gain and gene losses. A culmination of all these factors has led to the evolution of HCoVs that can cause mild infections as well as the global pandemic COVID-19. Using simplified phylogenetic trees, we elucidate the probable primary zoonotic origin and the animal reservoirs for the HCoV family. This chapter aims to highlight the evolution of the common cold triggering HCoV cluster (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1), as well as the severe epidemic and pandemic causing HCoV cluster (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV). The final section of this chapter is dedicated to exploring clinical therapies against the above CoVs. As such the CoV replication pathways are exploited, and a select few repurposed drug candidates, novel agents, and their combination are organized based on the steps they inhibit in this pathway.","Kaka, N.; Pal, A.; Abdul-Fattah, S.; Kakodkar, P.",Methods Pharmacol.

182852,Triterpene Constituents of Euphorbia Erythradenia Bioss. and their Anti-HIV Activity,2016,"Introduction As of 3rd June 2021, Malaysia is experiencing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. In response, the federal government has implemented various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) under a series of Movement Control Orders and, more recently, a vaccination campaign to regain epidemic control. In this study, we assessed the potential for the vaccination campaign to control the epidemic in Malaysia and four high-burden regions of interest, under various public health response scenarios. Methods A modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered compartmental model was developed that included two sequential incubation and infectious periods, with stratification by clinical state. The model was further stratified by age and incorporated population mobility to capture NPIs and micro-distancing (behaviour changes not captured through population mobility). Emerging variants of concern (VoC) were included as an additional strain competing with the existing wild-type strain. Several scenarios that included different vaccination strategies (i.e. vaccines that reduce disease severity and/or prevent infection, vaccination coverage) and mobility restrictions were implemented. Results The national model and the regional models all fit well to notification data but underestimated ICU occupancy and deaths in recent weeks, which may be attributable to increased severity of VoC or saturation of case detection. However, the true case detection proportion showed wide credible intervals, highlighting incomplete understanding of the true epidemic size. The scenario projections suggested that under current vaccination rates complete relaxation of all NPIs would trigger a major epidemic. The results emphasise the importance of micro-distancing, maintaining mobility restrictions during vaccination roll-out and accelerating the pace of vaccination for future control. Malaysia is particularly susceptible to a major COVID-19 resurgence resulting from its limited population immunity due to the historical success of the country in maintaining control throughout much of 2020.","Jayasundara, P.; Peariasamy, K.

We show that if the private party does not have negotiating power over the project’s surplus, then no inefficient delays are attributable to the moral hazard issue. However, if the private party has negotiating power, then the first-best timing is not guaranteed. The time discrepancy is shown to be costly in terms of overall project efficiency. The explicit consideration of the private party’s negotiating power can explain empirical evidence that private parties in PPPs tend to reap excess returns. These results are discussed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications for PPPs.","Buso, Marco Moretto Michele Zormpas Dimitrios",Economic Modelling,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2021.105586,12

Proof of the Concept in a Gastric Lymph Node Metastasis Model.,2016,"Purpose: This paper proposes a management accounting framework for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) operating in developing countries. The development of the framework was motivated by the existing low uptake of management accounting and inconsistent use of Management Accounting Practices (MAPs) by SMEs, especially in emerging economies. The model framework advanced in this paper is meant to regularise and systematise the use of MAPs by SMEs. Methodology: The study adopted a qualitative research approach using semi-structured interviews. A total of thirteen focus group meetings, nineteen face-to-face in-depth interviews and twenty-one key informant interviews were conducted in five provinces in Zimbabwe. Data was analysed following a reflexive thematic analysis through content analysis using Atlas. ti. Findings: The paper proposed a six staged systematic implementation method that makes the application of MAPs less cumbersome and easy to implement. The framework can be applied to other similar contexts in the Global South. It is highly recommended that SMEs should apply management accounting as it use promotes competitive advantage and success for an entity. Originality/Value: The framework is envisaged to increase the usage of management accounting among SMEs as well as reducing inconsistencies in the application of MAPs among SMEs.","Dlamini, Banele Schutte Daniel","Journal of Accounting, Finance and Auditing Studies",https://doi.org/10.32602/jafas.2021.023,12
184271,Clinical and biological distinctions between type I and type II acquired angioedema.,2003,"To meet the assessments requirements during the COVID-19 epidemic, many schools adopted the large-scale blended online examination, in which teachers invigilate through online video and students answer questions with pen and paper. Exploring the factors that influence students’ acceptance of the blended online examination will help the exam service understand the characteristics of students’ adoption and provide better support for staffs. It will help teachers and parents to assist students to take the blended examination and maintain the traditional exam atmosphere that will facilitate students’ learning performance and effectiveness. In this study, a questionnaire survey and structural equation method were adopted to explore the influence of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, social presence, place presence, and social influence on learners’ acceptance of blended online examination. Data analysis of 760 college students who underwent a blended online examination showed that perceived ease of use had a significant negative direct impact on exam acceptability and overall had a significant negative impact. Perceived usefulness, social presence, and social influence have significant positive effects on exam acceptability and social presence and social influence also have significant positive effects indirectly by influencing perceived usefulness. Finally, the limitations of this study are discussed, and the implications and future direction are put forward. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Jiang, X.

184348,Prospects for a vaccine against otitis media.,2006,"Telomere length and shortening rate are increasingly used as biomarkers for long-term costs in ecological and evolutionary studies because of their relationships with survival and fitness. Both early-life conditions and growth, and later-life stressors can create variation in telomere shortening rate. Studies on between-population telomere length and dynamics are scarce, despite the expectation that populations exposed to varying environmental constraints would present divergent telomere length patterns. The pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) is a passerine bird breeding across Eurasia (from Spain to western Siberia) and migrating through the Iberian Peninsula to spend the non-breeding period in sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, different populations show marked differences in migration distance. We studied the large-scale variation of telomere length and early-life dynamics in the pied flycatcher by comparing six European populations across a north-south gradient (Finland, Estonia, England, and Spain) and considered the effects of migration distance and nestling growth. There were clear population differences in telomere length, with English birds having the longest telomeres, followed by Spanish and lastly by Estonian and Finnish birds. Telomere length did not thus show consistent latitudinal variation and was not linearly linked to differences in migration distance. Early-life telomere shortening rate tended to vary between populations. Fast growth was associated with shorter telomeres in the early life, but faster nestling growth affected telomeres more negatively in northern than southern populations. While the sources of between-population differences in telomere-related biology remain to be more intensively studied, our study illustrates the need to expand telomere studies at the between-population level.","Kärkkäinen, Tiia; Laaksonen, Toni; Burgess, Malcolm; Cantarero, Alejandro; Martínez-Padilla, Jesús; Potti, Jaime; Moreno, Juan; Thomson, Robert L.; Tilgar, Vallo; Stier, Antoine",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.16.435615,12

After analysis of the scientific literature, eight groups of risks associated with agricultural products import were determined: supply risks, demand risks, production risks, management plus operational risks, logistical plus infrastructural risks, political risks, policy plus regulatory risks and financial risks. In order to assess the importance of all import risk groups, three Multicriteria decision support methods (MCDM)-SAW, TOPSIS and Geometric means-for expert evaluation are used. The article introduces a new import risks assessment framework CIRA (Country's Imports Risk Assessment) contributing to the systematic approach of a country's international trade risks management. The results order risk groups according to their importance in the following order: production (the most crucial risk group), logistical plus infrastructural, financial, management plus operational, political, supply, policy plus regulatory and demand risks.","Baranauskaite, L.; Jureviciene, D.",Economies,https://doi.org/10.3390/economies9030102,12

These organizations are also legally required to protect the privacy of individuals from whom they collect data. Differential Privacy (DP) provides a solution to release useful summary data while preserving privacy. Most DP mechanisms are designed to answer a single set of queries. In reality, there are often multiple stakeholders that use a given data release and have overlapping but not-identical queries. This introduces a novel joint optimization problem in DP where the privacy budget must be shared among different analysts. We initiate study into the problem of DP query answering across multiple analysts. To capture the competing goals and priorities of multiple analysts, we formulate three desiderata that any mechanism should satisfy in this setting -- The Sharing Incentive, Non-Interference, and Adaptivity -- while still optimizing for overall error. We demonstrate how existing DP query answering mechanisms in the multi-analyst settings fail to satisfy at least one of the desiderata. We present novel DP algorithms that provably satisfy all our desiderata and empirically show that they incur low error on realistic tasks.","Pujol, David; Wu, Yikai; Fain, Brandon; Machanavajjhala, Ashwin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01192v4.pdf,12

ANIMALS 103 feedlot calves from New Mexico and 100 from Arkansas. PROCEDURES Calves were studied from before shipping to 35 days after arrival at the feedlot. Nasal swab specimens, fecal samples, and serum samples were obtained before shipping, at arrival, and periodically thereafter. Bovine coronavirus antigen and antibodies were detected by use of an ELISA. RESULTS NM calves had a high geometric mean titer for BCV antibody at arrival (GMT, 1,928); only 2% shed BCV in nasal secretions and 1% in feces. In contrast, AR calves had low antibody titers against BCV at arrival (GMT, 102) and 64% shed BCV in nasal secretions and 65% in feces. Detection of BCV in nasal secretions preceded detection in feces before shipping AR calves, but at arrival, 73% of AR calves were shedding BCV in nasal secretions and feces. Bovine coronavirus infection was significantly associated with respiratory tract disease and decreased growth performance in AR calves. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Replication and shedding of BCV may start in the upper respiratory tract and spread to the gastrointestinal tract. Vaccination of calves against BCV before shipping to feedlots may provide protection against BCV infection and its effects with other pathogens in the induction of respiratory tract disease.","Thomas, Christopher J; Hoet, Armando E; Sreevatsan, Srinand; Wittum, Thomas E; Briggs, Robert E; Duff, Glenn C; Saif, Linda J",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16881855/,12

Evaluation of the present algorithm for prehospital ECG transmission is important to ensure correct and expeditious patient care. The purpose of this study was to evaluate ECGs transmitted from the prehospital setting to a non-invasive department of cardiology. METHODS At Lillebaelt Hospital, the cardiologist on-call evaluated and entered the transmitted ECGs and the associated transmission criteria into the Clinical Measurement System database (KMS). Furthermore, data from the KMS and the diagnoses at discharge were obtained from 2012 to 2015. RESULTS A total of 9,751 ECGs were included in the study. ECG transmission increased by 35% from year one to year three (p less-than 0.05). A total of 362 patients (3.7%) had STEMI. 25% of all ECGs were transmitted without any obvious cardiac symptom but produced a diagnosis of other cardiac illnesses than acute coronary syndrome in 28% of these patients. The number of ECGs sent per adult inhabitant in the area per year was 1:85. CONCLUSIONS A large number of ECGs are transmitted annually and at an increasing rate, and STEMI only comprises a very limited proportion of all transmitted ECGs to a non-invasive centre in Denmark. The high number of ECGs challenge the available resources, which are limited and should be used effectively, particularly in a period characterised by increased healthcare demands. FUNDING none.

Eight trained, male cyclists/triathletes (45 ± 4 y, VO2peak: 65 ± 10 ml·kg-1·min-1, peak aerobic power: 397 ± 71 W) completed 3 15-min time-trials (∼75% VO2peak) pre-loaded with 45 min of steady-state (∼55% VO2peak) cycling following > 24 h standardization of training and diet. Measures of work completed, rectal and mean skin temperatures, heart rate, expiratory gases and venous blood samples were taken. Compared to Control, Pre-Sago resulted in a smaller rise in rectal temperature (0.3 ± 0.5°C) while heart rate increased to a greater extent (6 ± 13 beats·min-1) during exercise (both P < 0.05), however, compared to Control time-trial performance remained unaffected (Pre-Sago: -0.5 ± 4.0%, P > 0.05). During exercise, plasma glucose concentrations were maintained higher for Dur-Sago than Control (P < 0.05), however substrate oxidation rates remained similar (P > 0.05). Dur-Sago also resulted in a higher plasma sodium concentration (2 ± 2 mmol·l1) and lower whole-body sweat loss (544 ± 636 g) and, therefore, reduced plasma volume contraction (all P < 0.05). Heart rate increased to a greater extent (5 ± 13 beats·min-1) during Dur-Sago, yet compared to Control time-trial performance remained unaffected (+0.9 ± 2.3%, P > 0.05). Uniquely, these results indicate that during exercise heat stress feeding sago can result in some 'beneficial' physiological responses, however these do not translate to changes in exercise performance when performed in a post-prandial state.","Che Jusoh, Mohd Rahimi; Stannard, Stephen R; Mündel, Toby",Temperature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27857961/,12

CASE REPORTS The authors present clinical data of 19 hospitalized patients (12 males), aged 20-73 years, with marked (less than 45/min during daily hours) self-limiting SB. None of them had SB at admission or earlier, none had used cardiovascular medications potentially decreasing the heart rate. Pulmonary involvement was severe in 4, moderate in 13 and mild in 2 patients; 14 needed oxygen therapy (4 using high flow oxygen equipment), none required treatment in the intensive care unit. All patients were given low molecular weight heparin in a prophylactic dose, 13 intravenous ceftriaxone, 12 dexamethasone, 8 convalescent plasma. Before SB appearance, 12 patients were treated with remdesivir (3 patients did not receive a full planned dose) and 2 with tocilizumab. SB appeared suddenly on day 5-14 from the onset of the disease, with a minimal heart rate of 32-44/min and in 3 cases it was mildly symptomatic; 2 of those received ad-hoc atropine, one orciprenaline. Interleukin-6 (Il-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations at SB onset were significantly lower than at admission (9.3 vs 70.0 pg/ml and 16.8 vs 98.5 mg/l, respectively). Cardiac troponin I was slightly elevated in 2 patients. ECG morphology abnormalities (transient negative T waves or ST depression) were found in 4 males. All subjects had normal left ventricular ejection fraction; in 5 echocardiography revealed small pericardial effusion; in 10 patients, longitudinal strain was also studied: reginal abnormalities were found in all of them, particularly in basal segments. SB lasted 3-11 days and was reversible in all patients; none required temporary stimulation. The COVID-19 course was favorable in all patients; they were stable at discharge.

The mortality rate for piglets under 3 weeks old is 100%, but they are usually protected by maternal antibodies. Recently, the risk of an HEV outbreak has increased in the pig industry, because of widely using specific pathogen-free pigs that have no antibodies to HEV. We developed reverse transcription (RT) PCR and nested PCR to detect HEV. Primer sets of polymerase, non-structural protein, and spike protein were designed for RT-PCR and nested PCR based on the nucleotide sequences of the HEV 67N strain. The PCR designated primer sets of spike protein detected only HEV viral RNA among other related nidoviruses. Detection of HEV viral RNA by nested PCR was more sensitive than virus isolation in cell cultures. Nested PCR detected HEV viral RNA from experimentally infected samples of mice and field samples of piglets. The RT-PCR and nested PCR methods to detect HEV is considered a good way to show the HEV etiology on pig farms.","Sekiguchi, Yoshiko; Shirai, Junsuke; Taniguchi, Takahide; Honda, Eiichi",The Journal of veterinary medical science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15133265/,12

In this case, infection control and environmental contamination were the culprits, particularly, a drop of blood containing 5 million IU HCV. From a broader perspective, there has been a revolution in HCV therapy with the recent rapid evolution of short-term (12 weeks) safe, all oral directly- acting antiviral (DAA) therapy leading to cure rates of 90% to 100%, even in previously difficult to treat patients with liver cirrhosis, previous treatment failure and those on immunosuppression. Consequently, treating HCV in risk groups such as renal dialysis and haemophiliacs can eliminate a pool of infected patients to prevent future outbreaks. A seroprevalence study is needed to identify a possible ""birth cohort"" effect that could aid screening. For HBV, vaccination has reduced prevalence to 3.8%, but these patients are prone to complications such as HBV flares. Since 2014, 13 patients developed liver failure and were listed for liver transplantation at National University Hospital (NUH) but 6 died beforehand. This avoidable catastrophe is due to undiagnosed HBV infection or patients who did not return for follow-up. Good antiviral therapy is available, but the issues are similar to HCV, identification of patients and linkage to care. A cure seems likely in the future as pharmaceutical companies are developing new agents. Singapore has joined in this initiative with a recent award of a national research translational grant to better understand the pathophysiology and the processes needed for a cure of HBV.","Lim, Seng Gee","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27118226/,12

Surveillance also provides for the preparation against potential influenza pandemics with the identification of the genetic properties of viruses and the mutant strains that could pose a threat. In this study, data in the scope of national influenza surveillance carried out by National Influenza Center, Turkey for five consecutive influenza seasons between 2010-2015, following the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus pandemic, have been presented and evaluated. A total of 15.149 respiratory samples, including 8.894 sentinel and 6.255 non-sentinel specimens, during 2010-2015 influenza seasons, within the periods between September and May, were evaluated in our center. All samples were tested using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) for the presence of influenza virus types and subtypes. Within the sentinel influenza surveillance, the samples that were detected negative for influenza viruses, have also been tested for the other respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses) using the same technique. Further analysis, including virus isolation by cell culture inoculation and antigenic characterization by hemagglutination inhibiton test were performed for the samples found positive for influenza A and B viruses. Selected representative virus isolates have been sent to WHO reference laboratory for the sequence analysis. In the study, influenza virus positivity rates detected for all of the samples (sentinel+non-sentinel) were as follows; 34% (779/2316) in 2010-11 season; 25% (388/1554) in 2011-12; 20% (696/3541) in 2012-13; 23% (615/2678) in 2013-14; and 26% (1332/5060) in 2014-15. When all the samples were considered for influenza A and B viruses, the positivity rates for the seasons of 2010-11; 2011-12; 2012-13; 2013-14; 2014-15 were determined as follows; 49.9% and 50.1%, 71.6% and 28.4%; 98.3% and 1.7%; 73.6% and 26.4%; 48.1% and 51.9%, respectively. The frequency of respiratory viruses detected only in sentinel samples other than influenza, were found as follows; 10% (148/1435) in 2010-11; 18% (175/963) in 2011-12; 23% (415/1768) in 2012-13; 22% (468/2108) in 2013-14; and 21% (546/2620) in 2014-15 seasons. When the distribution of influenza virus subtypes were considered, the detection rates of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses in all of the samples were 55% and 45%; 0% and 100%; 95% and 5%; 2% and 98%; and 79% and 21% in the seasons of 2010-11; 2011-12; 2012-13; 2013-14; and 2014-15, respectively. For B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages, those rates in the same order of seasons were found as 15% and 85%; 98% and 2%; 0% and 100%; 16% and 84%; and 2% and 98%, respectively. When the data were evaluated, for 2010-2011 and 2014-2015 seasons, cocirculation of influenza A and B were observed within the same periods and similar proportions, but the peak activity occurred 7-8 weeks later for 2014-2015 season. For both seasons, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were predominant for non-sentinel, while A(H3N2) viruses were predominant for sentinel detections. During 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 seasons, influenza activity presented similar profile; predominance of A(H3N2) and B viruses observed while A(H1N1)pdm09 virus detections remained low. In contrast, for the 2012-2013 season, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were predominant and the detection of A(H3N2) and B viruses remained low. For the seasons in which A(H3N2) was predominant, the peak activity seen earlier than the other seasons. For all seasons, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in circulation were antigenically compatible with the vaccine virus, while A(H3N2) viruses were compatible for three seasons (2010-11, 2012-13, 2013-14) and incompatible in two seasons (2011-12, 2014-15). Influenza B viruses were determined as antigenically compatible with the vaccine viruses in all except 2010-2011 season. Predominance of B/Victoria lineage were observed during 2011-2012 season while the rest of the majority were B/Yamagata. The positivity rates of other respiratory viruses which were also analyzed in the scope of sentinel influenza surveillance were similar to influenza positivity for all seasons except 2010-2011. This fact has emphasized that, those viruses were also responsible for influenza-like illness especially during the early and late phases of the season. In conclusion, monitoring of the antigenic and genetic characteristics of influenza viruses by surveillance studies is essential for the early detection of potential pandemic variants as well as to ensure similarities among the circulating strains and the corresponding vaccine strains.","Altaş, Ayşe Başak; Bayrakdar, Fatma; Korukluoğlu, Gülay",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27525396/,12

However, age and sex disaggregated data of COVID-19 cases and deaths are rarely reported. Such data are very crucial for public to make truly informed choices about their own diseases risk and also for governments for public policy response. Objective To assess age and gender difference among COVID-19 cases and deaths in Nepal. Method This is a retrospective study which uses public data on COVID-19 cases and deaths released by Ministry of Health and Population, Government of Nepal from January to November, 2020. The data analysis was carried out using SPPS software version 26. Result Nepal reported 233,452 confirmed cases and 1,566 deaths of COVID-19 from 23 January 2020 to 30 November 2020. We found statistically significant differences on COVID-19 cases by age and gender in Nepal with higher number of cases among males of economically active age groups (20-60 years). Similarly, we found significant difference in COVID-19 mortality with more death occurred among male group compared to female group and with highest number of deaths among the people of above 60 years. Furthermore, we found differences in cases and deaths among provinces. Conclusion The age and gender differences in COVID cases and deaths in Nepal indicates needs of considering age and sex groups seriously while planning for testing, case management and vaccination against COVID-19 infections in Nepal.","Dhimal, M L; Rana, N; Aryal, B; Adhikari, S K; Shrestha, R; Gyanwali, P; Dhimal, M",Kathmandu University medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34165086/,12

193875,Clinical pathology and assessment of pathogen exposure in southern and Alaskan sea otters.,2003,"A 2-yr-old male gyrfalcon ( Falco rusticolus ) was presented for severe and generalized muscle spasticity and pododermatitis. The falcon had been treated for pododermatitis over the previous 4 mo. Muscle rigidity and spasms involved the entire bird but were more severe on the right leg. The bird was also tachypneic and hyperthermic at 45 C. While the plantar pododermatitis lesions had healed, there was still a small abscess on the lateral aspect of the right foot. Clinical signs were consistent with tetanus. Several bacteria were isolated from the abscess including Clostridium tetani . The isolate was confirmed to be toxigenic by PCR. Attempts to detect tetanus toxin in the bird's plasma were unsuccessful. The abscess was debrided. The gyrfalcon received equine tetanus antitoxin, intravenous metronidazole, methocarbamol, midazolam, a constant-rate infusion of Fentanyl, active cooling, and supportive care. Inhalant anesthesia with isoflurane was the only treatment that would lower the body temperature and reduce the clinical signs. The gyrfalcon died a few hours after admission. The characteristic clinical signs and isolation of toxigenic C. tetani from a wound were strong supportive evidence for a diagnosis of tetanus. This case constitutes the first reported natural occurrence of tetanus in an avian species. Further information is needed to determine whether gyrfalcons are more susceptible to tetanus than are other avian species and whether pododermatitis lesions may be risk factors.","Beaufrère, Hugues; Laniesse, Delphine; Stickings, Paul; Tierney, Robert; Sesardic, Thea; Slavic, Durda; Compo, Nicole; Smith, Dale A",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27902906/,12
194166,Astroviruses.,1995,"Formation of the coronavirus replication-transcription complex involves the synthesis of large polyprotein precursors that are extensively processed by virus-encoded cysteine proteases. In this study, the coding sequence of the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) main protease, 3CL(pro), was determined. Comparative sequence analyses revealed that FIPV 3CL(pro) and other coronavirus main proteases are related most closely to the 3C-like proteases of potyviruses. The predicted active centre of the coronavirus enzymes has accepted unique replacements that were probed by extensive mutational analysis. The wild-type FIPV 3CL(pro) domain and 25 mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and tested for proteolytic activity in a peptide-based assay. The data strongly suggest that, first, the FIPV 3CL(pro) catalytic system employs His(41) and Cys(144) as the principal catalytic residues. Second, the amino acids Tyr(160) and His(162), which are part of the conserved sequence signature Tyr(160)-Met(161)-His(162) and are believed to be involved in substrate recognition, were found to be indispensable for proteolytic activity. Third, replacements of Gly(83) and Asn(64), which were candidates to occupy the position spatially equivalent to that of the catalytic Asp residue of chymotrypsin-like proteases, resulted in proteolytically active proteins. Surprisingly, some of the Asn(64) mutants even exhibited strongly increased activities. Similar results were obtained for human coronavirus (HCoV) 3CL(pro) mutants in which the equivalent Asn residue (HCoV 3CL(pro) Asn(64)) was substituted. These data lead us to conclude that both the catalytic systems and substrate-binding pockets of coronavirus main proteases differ from those of other RNA virus 3C and 3C-like proteases.","Hegyi, Annette; Friebe, Agnes; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Ziebuhr, John",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11842253/,12

METHODS One hundred and three stool samples from 46 SARS patients were collected on May 16th, 20th, and 23rd, 2003. For each sample, RNA was extracted using commercial kit and 7 Nest RT-PCR using a 14-pair different SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) special primers were carried out simultaneously. RESULTS Among these 46 SARS patients, 17 cases (37.0%) were stool SARS-CoV RT-PCR negative, and 29 cases (63.0%) were SARS-CoV RT-PCR positive. The duration of positive cases lasted (31.76 +/- 10.78) d (12-64 d). The longest stool shedding case in this study lasted 64 days. Two serial stool samples and for each sample 2 RT-PCR tests using different primers were positive in this case. CONCLUSIONS Our study observed longest stool shedding of SARS patients to be 64 days after initial onset of SARS. The average stool shedding was 32 days. Hence it is important to think highly of SARS convalescent patient stool sterilization.","Ren, Yi; Ding, Hui-guo; Wu, Qing-fa; Chen, Wei-jun; Chen, Dong; Bao, Zhi-ying; Yang, Ling; Zhao, Chun-hui; Wang, Jian",Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

The local efficacy of radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of lung cancer depends on tumor size and the type of electrode used, but not on tumor type. An important factor for the prevention of local failure may be the acquisition of an adequate ablative margin. The combination of embolization and radiation therapy enhances the local efficacy. Local failure may be salvaged by repeating the radiofrequency ablation, particularly in small tumors. Survival rates after radiofrequency ablation are quite promising for patients with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer and pulmonary metastasis from colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. The complications caused by radiofrequency ablation can be treated conservatively in the majority of cases. However, attention should be paid to rare but serious complications. This review shows that radiofrequency ablation is a promising treatment for patients with lung cancer.","Hiraki, Takao; Gobara, Hideo; Mimura, Hidefumi; Toyooka, Shinichi; Fujiwara, Hiroyasu; Yasui, Kotaro; Sano, Yoshifumi; Iguchi, Toshihiro; Sakurai, Jun; Tajiri, Nobuhisa; Mukai, Takashi; Matsui, Yusuke; Kanazawa, Susumu",Acta medica Okayama,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22037265/,12

All percutaneous infrapopliteal interventions among patients with DM from 2006 to 2013 were reviewed and pre-procedure fasting blood glucose (FBG) was recorded. The primary endpoint was primary patency at 1 year as determined by duplex ultrasound. A total of 309 infrapopliteal lesions in 149 patients with DM were treated with balloon angioplasty during the study period. The median FBG was 144 mg/dL. At 1 year, the rate of primary patency was 16% for patients with FBG above the median, compared to 46% for patients with FBG below the median (hazard ratio (HR) 1.82 for FBG ≥144, p=0.005). Amputation rates at 1 year trended higher among patients with high versus low FBG (24% vs 15%, p=0.1). One year major adverse limb event rates were also higher for patients with high versus low FBG (35% vs 23%, p=0.05). Although patients with high FBG were more likely to have insulin-requiring DM (73% vs 50%, p=0.003) the association of high FBG with loss of primary patency remained significant even after adjusting for insulin use as well as other lesion-specific characteristics (adjusted HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.8). In conclusion, high fasting blood glucose at the time of infrapopliteal balloon angioplasty is associated with significantly decreased primary patency and may also be a risk factor for major adverse limb events among patients with a threatened limb.","Singh, Satinder; Armstrong, Ehrin J; Sherif, Walid; Alvandi, Bejan; Westin, Gregory G; Singh, Gagan D; Amsterdam, Ezra A; Laird, John R",Vascular medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24939930/,12

This report describes the clinical features of H1N1 and their prevalence from non-confirmed subjects according to seroprevalence status in México. The objective was to determine the prevalence of these clinical features from non-confirmed cases of pandemic H1N1 and to compare them according to seroprevalence status in northern Monterrey, México, during 2009, and to identify the predictive signs and symptoms; there have been no prior serologic studies in México. METHODS During November-December 2009, 2,222 volunteers, ages 6-99 years, were categorized into 3 symptomatic groups: influenza-like illness, respiratory illness, and non-respiratory illness. Antibodies against influenza A/H1N1/2009 were determined by a virus-free enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Demographics and clinical presentation were assessed through face-to-face questionnaire, and the association with seroprevalence status was determined and compared. RESULTS Overall seroprevalence was 39%. Of the seropositive subjects, 67% were symptomatic and 33% were asymptomatic. Seventy-one percent of seropositive symptomatic subjects reported respiratory illness, 17% reported non-respiratory symptoms, and 12% reported influenza-like illness. The most common symptoms were rhinorrhea/nasal congestion (93%) and headache (83%). No significant difference was found between the symptom profiles of the seropositive group, compared to the seronegative one, nor of the median duration of symptoms. The seropositive group had a significantly elevated proportion of influenza-like illness (12%), compared to the seronegative group (8%). The proportion of subjects who took days off and who sought medical attention was significantly higher in the seropositive group. No single symptom was associated as a predictor of seropositiveness. CONCLUSIONS One third of the seropositive subjects were asymptomatic, and few had an influenza-like illness. No difference was found in the symptom profiles of the seropositive and seronegative groups. No single symptom predicted seropositiveness. Large scale population studies are needed, especially in México, to characterize clinical syndromes.","Elizondo-Montemayor, Leticia; Hernández-Torre, Martín; Ugalde-Casas, Patricia A; Santos-Guzmán, Jesús; Serrano-González, Mónica; Gutiérrez, Norma G; Lam-Franco, Lorena; Tamargo-Barrera, Daniela; Martínez, Ubaldo; Bustamante-Careaga, Humberto; Alvarez, Mario M; Schultz-Cherry, Stacey",Respiratory care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22418453/,12

Two HMPV subgroups, A and B, and four genotypes, A1, A2, B1 and B2, have been identified. Concurrent circulation of the different genotypes in yearly epidemics has been recorded globally, but not in Saudi Arabia. The current report was designed to study HMPV epidemiology in Saudi children and to analyze the genetic diversity and circulation patterns. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (n = 174) were collected from hospitalized children in Riyadh (2008-2009). The screening of samples using real-time RT-PCR identified 19 HMPV strains. The majority of the strains belonged to subgroup B, while all strains of subgroup A were members of genotype A2. In 2008, only subgroup B was recognized, whereas in 2009 both subgroups were identified to be cocirculating at similar rates. The full-length attachment (G) gene and a partial sequence of the fusion (F) gene of positive samples were sequenced. The G gene showed a high degree of genetic diversity and exhibited a variable number of positively selected sites in different lineages. In contrast, the F gene demonstrated an extensive genetic stability with a higher tendency toward purifying selection. This is the first report on HMPV genotype circulation in Saudi Arabia; however, the exact circulation kinetics requires further retrospective and prospective study.","Amer, Haitham Mohamed",Journal of molecular microbiology and biotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27694746/,12

Although transfusion-free (TF) operation is thought to be beneficial, results supporting its beneficial effects are lacking. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the impact on PD patients of a TF program. From December 2003 to April 2013, 80 consecutive patients with periampullary lesions underwent PD performed. These patients were divided into two groups as follows: 39 PD patients in the ""before TF program"" (Group 1) and 41 PD patients in the ""after TF program"" (Group 2). Among patients in Group 2, patients who agreed with the TF program were enrolled and proceed with the TF program prospectively. Participants in the TF program had perioperative blood augmentation and intraoperative acute normovolemic hemodilution. The perioperative data were compared with the two groups. The mean preoperative hemoglobin, operative times, and operative blood loss showed no significance between two groups. The mean postoperative hemoglobin was lower in Group 2 (11.7 g/dL vs 10.9 g/dL, P = 0.038). The mean amount of blood transfusion was significantly lower in Group 2. (950.8 mL vs 124.9 mL, P = 0.009). The TF program considerably decreases the amount of perioperative blood transfusion. The overall perioperative course and complication rate in the TF group were not inferior to those in the non-TF group.

In the United States alone, mortality attributed to annual epidemics of influenza is estimated at 36,000 deaths per year. Influenza viruses also cause pandemics, during which the rates of illness and death can be expected to be much higher.

This article summarizes relevant features of influenza and the surveillance activities carried out at each of these levels to monitor influenza activity. Particular emphasis is given to the state's laboratory-based surveillance network, developed and coordinated by the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, that features strong and productive partnerships with private sector clinicians and laboratories and that provides a solid foundation for surveillance directed at other public health threats such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and bioterrorism.","Shult, Peter A; Kirk, Carol",WMJ : official publication of the State Medical Society of Wisconsin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14658564/,12

Viral shedding in COVID-19, as measured by isolation of infectious virus, is most prominent around symptom onset. Sars-cov-2 PCR, however, may stay positive for months and thereby does not reflect infectiousness. PCR tests are both specific and sensitive but the performance in clinical diagnostics depends on sampling technique, sample material and disease stage. Self-sampling in individuals with mild symptoms aims rather to assess infectiousness and a lower sensitivity of the test can be accepted. False positive tests are a global problem and may have serious consequences for both the tested individuals and society. Awareness of contamination risks and continuous quality assurance is vital in all laboratories to ensure test reliability. Rapid, less sensitive sars-cov-2 antigen tests are potential new tools in infection control.","Andersson, Emmi; Sönnerborg, Anders",Lakartidningen,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242336/,12

In this research a very simple novel and robust deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) model with less number of trainable-parameters is proposed to assist the radiologists and physicians in the early detection of COVID-19 patients. It also helps to classify patients into COVID-19, pneumonia and normal on the bases of analysis of augmented X-ray images. This augmented dataset contains 4803 COVID-19 from 686 publicly available chest X-ray images along with 5000 normal and 5000 pneumonia samples. These images are divided into 80% training and 20 % validation. The proposed CNN model is trained on training dataset and then tested on validation dataset. This model has a promising performance with a mean accuracy of 92.29%, precision of 99.96%, Specificity of 99.85% along with Sensitivity value of 85.92%.

We examined the independent association between d-dimer and death in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Multicenter cohort study. SETTING: ICUs at 68 hospitals across the United States. PATIENTS: Critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to ICUs between March 4, 2020, and May 25, 2020, with a measured d-dimer concentration on ICU day 1 or 2. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary exposure was the highest normalized d-dimer level (assessed in four categories: < 2×, 2-3.9×, 4-7.9×, and &#8805; 8× the upper limit of normal) on ICU day 1 or 2. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for confounders. Among 3,418 patients (63.1% male; median age 62 yr [interquartile range, 52-71 yr]), 3,352 (93.6%) had a d-dimer concentration above the upper limit of normal. A total of 1,180 patients (34.5%) died within 28 days. Patients in the highest compared with lowest d-dimer category had a 3.11-fold higher odds of death (95% CI, 2.56-3.77) in univariate analyses, decreasing to a 1.81-fold increased odds of death (95% CI, 1.43-2.28) after multivariable adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and illness severity. Further adjustment for therapeutic anticoagulation did not meaningfully attenuate this relationship (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.36-2.19). CONCLUSIONS: In a large multicenter cohort study of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019, higher d-dimer levels were independently associated with a greater risk of death.","Short, Samuel A P; Gupta, Shruti; Brenner, Samantha K; Hayek, Salim S; Srivastava, Anand; Shaefi, Shahzad; Singh, Harkarandeep; Wu, Benjamin; Bagchi, Aranya; Al-Samkari, Hanny; Dy, Rajany; Wilkinson, Katherine; Zakai, Neil A; Leaf, David E",Crit Care Med,,12

While some, but not all, laboratory findings appear similar to sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), COVID-19- induced coagulopathy (CIC) appears to be more prothrombotic than hemorrhagic. It has been postulated that CIC may be an uncontrolled immunothrombotic response to COVID-19, and there is growing evidence of venous and arterial thromboembolic events in these critically ill patients. Clinicians around the globe are challenged with rapidly identifying reasonable diagnostic, monitoring and anticoagulant strategies to safely and effectively manage these patients. Thoughtful use of proven, evidence-based approaches must be carefully balanced with integration of rapidly emerging evidence and growing experience. The goal of this document is to provide guidance from the Anticoagulation Forum, a North American organization of anticoagulation providers, regarding use of anticoagulant therapies in patients with COVID-19.

Using a qualitative, inductive approach based on grounded theory, we conducted in-depth interviews with fifteen professional couples in Israel about their experiences with working from home and the division of labor and space between spouses. Our analysis revealed three key issues related to these experiences: the division of physical workspace between the spouses, the division of work time (compared to home time), and bodily-spatial aspects of the infiltration of workspace into home through the Zoom camera. The patterns described here suggest that the gendered power relations between spouses working from home are reproduced through an unequal negotiation of space and time in the home, so that in practice, men’s work was prioritized in spatio-temporal terms, whereas women’s workspace and time was more fragmented and dispersed throughout the home and day. These findings illuminate women’s right to workspace in the home as an issue of gender equality that has been amplified by the current global pandemic, and how gendered divisions of space and time serve to reproduce the gender order.","Waismel-Manor, Ronit Wasserman Varda Shamir-Balderman Orit",Sex roles,,12

211309,Live and Wet Markets: Food Access versus the Risk of Disease Emergence,2021,"BACKGROUND: One of the groups that is most vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic is pregnant women. They cannot choose to refrain from care; they and their children are at risk of severe complications related to the virus; and they lose comfort and support as clinics prohibit their partners and as societal restrictions demand isolation from friends and relatives. It is urgent to study how this group is faring during the pandemic and we focus here on their health-related worries. METHODS: A longitudinal survey at a Swedish hospital starting six months before (16 September 2019) and continuing during the COVID-19 outbreak (until 25 August 2020). 6,941 pregnant women and partners of diverse social backgrounds were recruited. 96 percent of birth-giving women in the city take early ultrasounds where recruitment took place. 62 percent of the women with an appointment and 51 percent of their partners gave consent to participate. RESULTS: Pregnant women experienced dramatically increased worries for their own health, as well as for their partner's and their child's health in the beginning of the pandemic. The worries remained at higher than usual levels throughout the pandemic. Similar, but less dramatic changes, were seen among partners. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for heightened awareness of pregnant women's and partners' health-related worries as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Related feelings such as anxiety have been linked to adverse pregnancy outcome and might have long-term effects. The health care system needs to prepare for follow-up visits with these families.","Naurin, Elin; Markstedt, Elias; Stolle, Dietlind; Enström, Daniel; Wallin, Anton; Andreasson, Ingrid; Attebo, Birgitta; Eriksson, Ottilia; Martinsson, Klara; Elden, Helen; Linden, Karolina; Sengpiel, Verena",Eur. j. public health,,12

METHODS: A total of 9 COVID-19 infected pediatric patients were included in this study. Clinical history, laboratory examination, and detailed CT imaging features were analyzed. All patients underwent the first CT scanning on the same day of being diagnosed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). A low-dose CT scan was performed during follow-up. RESULTS: All the child patients had positive results. Four patients had cough and one patient had fever. One patient presented both cough and fever. Two children presented other symptoms like sore throat and stuffy nose. One child showed no clinical symptom. Five patients had positive initial CT findings with subtle lesions like ground-glass opacity (GGO) or spot-like mixed consolidation. Three patients were reported with negative results in the initial and follow-up CT examination. One patient was reported with initial negative CT findings but turning positive during the first follow-up. All patients had absorbed lesions on follow-up CT images after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric COVID-19 patients have certain imaging and clinical features as well as disease prognosis.

The purpose of this article was to evaluate MRI features of uterine leiomyomas that predict volumetric response after uterine artery embolization (UAE). MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included 75 patients with 212 uterine leiomyomas who were successfully treated between August 2013 and December 2018. To predict uterine volumetric response, age, number of lesions, and baseline uterine volume were assessed. To predict leiomyoma volumetric response, a multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate six predictive factors: location, baseline leiomyoma volume, signal intensity on T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI, heterogeneity of signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI, and vascularity on subtraction imaging (SI). A five-variable predictive ROC model was developed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the signal intensity ratio on T2-weighted MRI, enhancement ratio, heterogeneity ratio on T2-weighted MRI, location, and baseline leiomyoma volume in predicting at least 40% leiomyoma volumetric response. RESULTS. Age, number of leiomyomas, and baseline uterine volume were not predictive of uterine volumetric response. A submucosal location was the best predictive factor of leiomyoma volumetric response, and it showed 32.2% more leiomyoma volumetric response compared with a nonsubmucosal location (p < .001). Hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI was the second best predictive factor of leiomyoma volumetric response, and it showed 16.9% more volumetric response compared with hypointense leiomyomas (p = .013). A small baseline leiomyoma volume (< 58 cm3) was associated with 10.2% more leiomyoma volumetric response compared with larger leiomyomas (p = .01). Leiomyomas that were hyperintense on SI showed 7.9% more leiomyoma volumetric response compared with those that were hypointense (p = .014). The five-variable ROC model showed high diagnostic accuracy with an AUC of 0.85, sensitivity of 82%, and specificity of 71%. CONCLUSION. A submucosal location, hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI, small baseline leiomyoma volume (< 58 cm3), and hyperintense leiomyoma on subtraction imaging are the main independent favorable predictors of leiomyoma volumetric response after UAE. An accurate predictive ROC model was developed that may help in selecting patients suitable for UAE. Quantitative assessment of heterogeneity on T2-weighted MRI showed promising results as a predictor of volumetric response, and further research in this area using texture analysis and radiomics is suggested.","Kurban, Lutfi Ali S; Metwally, Hesham; Abdullah, Mudar; Kerban, Abdurzag; Oulhaj, Abderrahim; Alkoteesh, Jamal Aldeen",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,12

The suspension of clinical placements and cancellation of objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE) is likely to have an influence on students' performance. Methods Using a questionnaire, a retrospective observational study was conducted. Our primary focus was 3rd year medical students following their examinations in May 2020. Results Out of 46 responses obtained, the results demonstrated over 2/3 felt they perform better in clinical OSCE compared to written examinations and the majority performed worse this year during the pandemic. On a Likert scale, a mean result of 3/5 was obtained for confidence upon returning to placement and to address this, most stated they would benefit from extra optional teaching. Additionally, a further average of 3.82 was derived to represent how greatly students believed the absence of third year clinical OSCE would negatively impact their performance in the OSCE for the following academic year. Conclusion The results of our study highlight that the cancellation of clinical placements and OSCE due to coronavirus has negatively impacted on medical education and if we are to be faced with future pandemics, we must be better prepared to train future doctors.","Harky, Amer; Karimaghaei, Donia; Katmeh, Hannah; Hewage, Savini",Acta Biomed,,12
214183,Increased Stress Resistance and Lifespan in Chaenorhabditis elegans Wildtype and Knockout Mutants-Implications for Depression Treatment by Medicinal Herbs,2021,"The coated porous section of stem surface is initially filled with callus that undergoes osseointegration process, which develops a bond between stem and bone, lessens the micromotions and transfers stresses to the bone, proximally. This phenomenon attributes to primary and secondary stabilities of the stems that exhibit trade-off the stem stiffness. This study attempts to ascertain the influence of stem stiffness on peri-prosthetic bone formation and stress shielding when in silico models of solid CoCr alloy and Ti alloy stems, and porous Ti stems (53.8 GPa and 31.5 GPa Young's moduli) were implanted. A tissue differentiation predictive mechanoregulation algorithm was employed to estimate the evolutionary bond between bone and stem interfaces with 0.5-mm- and 1-mm-thick calluses. The results revealed that the high stiffness stems yielded higher stress shielding and lower micromotions than that of low stiffness stems. Contrarily, bone formation around solid Ti alloy stem and porous Ti 53.8 GPa stem was augmented in 0.5-mm- and 1-mm-thick calluses, respectively. All designs of stems exhibited different rates of bone formation, diverse initial micromotions and stress shielding; however, long-term bone formation was coherent with different stress shielding. Therefore, contemplating the secondary stability of the stems, low stiffness stem (Ti 53.8 GPa) gave superior biomechanical performance than that of high stiffness stems.","Mehboob, Hassan; Ahmad, Furqan; Tarlochan, Faris; Mehboob, Ali; Chang, Seung Hwan",,,12

215810,The first 12 months of COVID-19: a timeline of immunological insights,2021,"BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to severe viral infections was reported to be associated with genetic variants in immune response genes using case reports and GWAS studies. SARS-CoV-2 is an emergent viral disease that caused millions of COVID-19 cases all over the world. Around 15 % of cases are severe and some of them are accompanied by dysregulated immune system and cytokine storm. There is increasing evidence that severe manifestations of COVID-19 might be attributed to human genetic variants in genes related to immune deficiency and or inflammasome activation (cytokine storm). OBJECTIVE: Identify the candidate genes that are likely to aid in explaining severe COVID-19 and provide insights to understand the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. METHODS: In this article, we systematically reviewed genes related to viral susceptibility that were reported in human genetic studies (Case-reports and GWAS) to understand the role of host viral interactions and to provide insights into the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. RESULTS: We found 40 genes associated with viral susceptibility and 21 of them were associated with severe SARS-CoV disease and severe COVID-19. Some of those genes were implicated in TLR pathways, others in C-lectin pathways, and others were related to inflammasome activation (cytokine storm). CONCLUSION: This compilation represents a list of candidate genes that are likely to aid in explaining severe COVID-19 which are worthy of inclusion in gene panels and during meta-analysis of different variants in host genetics studies of COVID-19. In addition, we provide several hypotheses for severe COVID-19 and possible therapeutic targets.","Elhabyan, Abdelazeem; Elyaacoub, Saja; Sanad, Ehab; Abukhadra, Abdelwahab; Elhabyan, Asmaa; Dinu, Valentin",Virus Res,,12

Methods: Observational study using MHDs' administrative data and individual data on suspected and positive cases of Sars-Cov-2. Adherence to recommentations was assessed using 21 indicators. Changes in rates were calculated by Poisson regression analysis, while the Fisher exact test was used for assessing differences between suspected and positive cases. Results: The decrease in voluntary admission rates on 100,000 inhabitants in hospital services was significantly larger from January to April 2020, compared to the same period of 2019 (P<0.001), while no other data showed a significant decrease. Among the 82 cases tested for Sars-Cov-2, five were positive, and they significantly differ from suspected cases only in that they were at home or in supported housing facilities prior to the test. The MHDs mostly complied with the indicators in the month after the publication of recommendations. Conclusions: Outpatient services continued to work normally during the emergency, while hospital services decreased their activities. A low number of positive cases was found among MHDs' users, which might be linked to a rapid reconversion of services, with an extensive use of home visits and telepsychiatry. These preliminary data should be interpreted with caution, due to the small size and the limited period of observation.","Castelpietra, Giulio; Colli, Chiara; Tossut, Davide; Furlan, Morena; Balestrieri, Matteo; Starace, Fabrizio; Beghi, Massimiliano; Barbone, Fabio; Perulli, Alfredo; Salvador-Carulla, Luis",,,12

Out of 442 cases which had travel history available, only one (0.2%) had a travel history to China. These findings underline the result of the model. However, the fact that there were numbers of imported cases from other regions shows the limits of the model. The limits could be attributed to the characteristics of the COVID-19 which is infectious even when the patients do not express any symptoms. Therefore, there is a profound need for all modelling researchers to take asymptomatic cases into account when they establish modelling studies.","Miyachi, T; Tanimoto, T; Kami, M",Epidemiol Infect,,12

219761,Targeting the SphK-S1P-SIPR Pathway as a Potential Therapeutic Approach for COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: School closures and other public health responses have decreased the extent that children interact with mandated reporters and other professionals trained to detect child maltreatment. OBJECTIVE: To assess associations between the pandemic public health response and the number of allegations of child abuse or neglect. METHODS: This study analyzed monthly data from New York City of the number of child maltreatment allegations, stratified by reporter type (e.g., mandated reporter, education personnel, healthcare personnel), as well as the number of Child Protective Services (CPS) investigations warranting child welfare preventative services. SARIMA models were trained using data from January 2015 to February 2020 to predict expected values for March, April, and May 2020. Observed values were compared against predicted values at an alpha of .05. RESULTS: Substantially fewer allegations of child maltreatment were reported than expected in March (-28.8 %, deviation: 1848, 95 % CI: [1272, 2423]), April (-51.5 %, deviation: 2976, 95 % CI: [2382, 3570]), and May 2020 (-46.0 %, deviation: 2959, 95 % CI: [2347, 3571]). Significant decreases in child maltreatment reporting were also noted for all reporter subtypes examined for March, April, and May 2020. Fewer CPS investigations warranted preventative services than expected in March 2020 (-43.5 %, deviation: 303, 95 % CI: [132, 475]). CONCLUSIONS: Precipitous drops in child maltreatment reporting and child welfare interventions coincided with social distancing policies designed to mitigate COVID-19 transmission. In light of these findings, educators and healthcare providers must be especially vigilant when engaging online with children and their families for signs of child abuse and/or neglect.","Rapoport, Eli; Reisert, Hailey; Schoeman, Emily; Adesman, Andrew",Child Abuse Negl,,12
221266,We Need a Vaccine,2020,"Purpose: The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which spread across the globe in a very short period of time, revealed that the transmission control of disease is a crucial step to prevent an outbreak and effective screening for viral infectious diseases is necessary. Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, infrared thermography (IRT) has been considered a gold standard method for screening febrile individuals at the time of pandemics. The objective of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of IRT for screening infectious diseases with specific applications to COVID-19. Approach: A literature review was performed in Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect to search for studies evaluating IRT screening from 2002 to present using relevant keywords. Additional literature searches were done to evaluate IRT in comparison to traditional core body temperature measurements and assess the benefits of measuring additional vital signs for infectious disease screening. Results: Studies have reported on the unreliability of IRT due to poor sensitivity and specificity in detecting true core body temperature and its inability to identify asymptomatic carriers. Airport mass screening using IRT was conducted during occurrences of SARS, Dengue, Swine Flu, and Ebola with reported sensitivities as low as zero. Other studies reported that screening other vital signs such as heart and respiratory rates can lead to more robust methods for early infection detection. Conclusions: Studies evaluating IRT showed varied results in its efficacy for screening infectious diseases. This suggests the need to assess additional physiological parameters to increase the sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive biosensors.","Khaksari, Kosar; Nguyen, Thien; Hill, Brian; Quang, Timothy; Perreault, John; Gorti, Viswanath; Malpani, Ravi; Blick, Emily; González Cano, Tomás; Shadgan, Babak; Gandjbakhche, Amir H",J Med Imaging (Bellingham),,12

223616,Recent advances in therapeutic modalities and vaccines to counter COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to unravel the professional and social consequences of COVID-19 as compared with the AIDS pandemic according to oral health care providers, staff, and administrators. METHODS: An exploratory qualitative inquiry via at-a-distance, semistructured interviews engaged a purposefully recruited sample of oral health care team workers in British Columbia. Interviews took place between April 20 and May 15, 2020; they were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and deidentified for interactive thematic analysis. An inductive process of coding was used to identify themes, subthemes, and categories of information. RESULTS: Forty-five interviews were conducted with 18 dentists, 12 dental hygienists, 6 certified dental assistants, and 9 administrators; 22 were females. Interviews each lasted an average of 48 min. After the transcripts were coded, 3 subthemes emerged: 1) personal protective equipment and universal precautions as commonsense approaches to care during both pandemics; 2) an (un)collapsed world in terms of global lockdowns; and 3) social unrest in terms of the potential for stigma and discrimination caused by both pandemics. These subthemes made up the COVID-19-AIDS parallel theme. CONCLUSION: This study explored the extent to which the current COVID-19 pandemic is leading to professional and social consequences when a parallel is drawn with the AIDS pandemic. This is the first qualitative study that identifies the potential social unrest of the pandemic from the perspective of oral health care providers and administrators. Future studies should include other providers across Canada, as well the patients receiving oral health care during this pandemic. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The COVID-19 pandemic has unraveled potential societal implications in a parallel to the HIV/AIDS era from the perspectives of oral health care providers and their staff. Such implications are changing the way that oral health care is delivered; it may also be leading to social unrest in the form of stigma and discrimination. This study discusses some of these implications from the perspective of oral health care providers and administrators.","Brondani, M; Donnelly, L",JDR Clin Trans Res,,12

225570,Numerical investigation on the origin of virus-laden droplets in the respiratory tract,2021,"Objective: To explore the characteristics and short-term changes of high resolution CT (HRCT) in subclinical stage of COVID-19. Methods: The HRCT images of 17 COVID-19 patients in subclinical stage were analyzed retrospectively in Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from January 15 to 31, 2020. There were 4 males and 13 females, age ranged from 25.0 to 51.0 (39.8±7.5) years, who were closely contacted with other COVID-19 patients. The follow-up CT examination was performed within 3 to 6 days after the initial CT examination in all patients. Six patients were treated using anti-virus, anti-inflammation and symptomatic therapy, while the other 11 patients were untreated. The subclinical CT findings and short-term follow-up were analyzed, and the CT changes of short-term follow-up were summarized. Results: The lesions of 17 COVID-19 patients were mainly located at the lower lobes of bilateral lungs (at the left lower lobe in 9 cases and at the right lower lobe in 10 cases in the subclinical stage, at the left lower lobe in 9 cases and at the right lower lobe in 11 cases in the short-term follow-up). The number of involved lung segments increased from 46 in the subclinical stage to 90 in the short-term follow-up. In the subclinical stage, the multiple lesions were found in 13 cases, while in the short-term follow-up, the number of cases with multiple lesions decreased by 7, however the cases with focal lesions increased by 6 and diffuse lesions by 4. The lesions were mainly distributed under the pleura (13 cases) or along the bronchovascular bundle(10 cases). In the short-term follow-up, the lesion in 1 case expanded from the subpleural area to neighbouring bronchovascular bundle. There were 3 main types of the lesions, including ground glass nodule, ground glass opacity and crazy-paving pattern. In the subclinical stage and short-term follow-up, the ground glass opacities were seen in all the 17 cases. In the short-term follow-up, the number of cases with ground glass nodules decreased by 4 and crazy-paving pattern increased by 4. In 6 patients after treatment, the multiple ground glass nodules became single one in 3 cases, and in other 3 cases the multiple ground glass opacities were getting smaller. However, the scope of lesions in 11 patients without treatment enlarged. Conclusion: The HRCT features of the COVID-19 in subcilincal stage have some charicteristics, such as small ground glass nodule, ground glass opacity along the subpleural area or along the bronchovascular bundle, and the great changes can be seen in the short-term follow-up.","Jiang, Nanchuan; Zheng, Chuansheng; Fan, Yanqing; Han, Xiaoyu; Chen, Yan; Cheng, Qiguang; Liang, Bo; Han, Ping; Shi, Heshui",Chin.

225660,Atomic-Level Characterization of the Methadone-Stabilized Active Conformation of µ-Opioid Receptor,2020,"COVID-19 has emerged as a global crisis with unprecedented socio-economic challenges, jeopardizing our lives and livelihoods for years to come. The unavailability of vaccines for COVID-19 has rendered rapid testing of the population instrumental in order to contain the exponential rise in cases of infection. Shortage of RT-PCR test kits and delays in obtaining test results calls for alternative methods of rapid and reliable diagnosis. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based solution using chest X-rays which can help in rapid triaging of COVID-19 patients. The proposed solution uses image enhancement, image segmentation, and employs a modified stacked ensemble model consisting of four CNN base-learners along with Naive Bayes as meta-learner to classify chest X-rays into three classes viz. COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal. An effective pruning strategy as introduced in the proposed framework results in increased model performance, generalizability, and decreased model complexity. We incorporate explainability in our article by using Grad-CAM visualization in order to establish trust in the medical AI system. Furthermore, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art GAN architectures and their ability to generate realistic synthetic samples of COVID-19 chest X-rays to deal with limited numbers of training samples. The proposed solution significantly outperforms existing methods, with 98.67% accuracy, 0.98 Kappa score, and F-1 scores of 100, 98, and 98 for COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia classes, respectively, on standard datasets. The proposed solution can be used as one element of patient evaluation along with gold-standard clinical and laboratory testing.","Singh, Rajeev Kumar; Pandey, Rohan; Babu, Rishie Nandhan",Neural Comput Appl,,12

227308,The influence of male dominance in female Anastrepha curvicauda mate selection,2021,"Mentorship is a critical component of career development, particularly in academic medicine. Peer mentorship, which does not adhere to traditional hierarchies, is perhaps more accessible for underrepresented groups, including women and minorities. In this article, we review various models of peer mentorship, highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages. Structured peer mentorship groups exist in different settings, such as those created under the auspices of formal career development programs, part of training grant programs, or through professional societies. Social media has further enabled the establishment of informal peer mentorship through participatory online groups, blogs, and forums that provide platforms for peer-to-peer advice and support. Such groups can evolve rapidly to address changing conditions, as demonstrated by physician listserv and Facebook groups related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Peer mentorship can also be found among colleagues brought together through a common location, interest, or goal, and typically these relationships are informal and fluid. Finally, we highlight here our experience with intentional formation of a small peer mentoring group that provides structure and a safe space for professional and social-emotional growth and support. In order to maximize impact and functionality, this model of peer mentorship requires commitment among peers and a more formalized process than many other peer mentoring models, accounting for group dynamics and the unique needs of members. When done successfully, the depth of these mentoring relationships can produce myriad benefits for individuals with careers in academic medicine including, but not limited to, those from underrepresented backgrounds.","Cree-Green, Melanie; Carreau, Anne-Marie; Davis, Shanlee M; Frohnert, Brigitte I; Kaar, Jill L; Ma, Nina S; Nokoff, Natalie J; Reusch, Jane E B; Simon, Stacey L; Nadeau, Kristen J",J Investig Med,,12
228303,mRNA vaccine: a potential therapeutic strategy,2021,"The increase in the world population, the advent of new infections and health issues, and the scarcity of natural biological products have spotlighted the importance of recombinant protein technology and its large-scale production in a cost-effective manner. Microalgae have become a significant promising platform with the potential to meet the increasing demand for recombinant proteins and other biologicals. Microalgae are safe organisms that can grow rapidly and are easily cultivated with basic nutrient requirements. Although continuous efforts have led to considerable progress in the algae genetic engineering field, there are still many hurdles to overcome before these microorganisms emerge as a mature expression system. Hence, there is a need to develop efficient expression approaches to exploit microalgae for the production of recombinant proteins at convenient yields. This study aimed to test the ability of the DNA geminiviral vector with Rep-mediated replication to transiently express recombinant proteins in the freshwater microalgal species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlorella vulgaris using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are representative antigen proteins and growth factor proteins, respectively, that were subcloned in a geminiviral vector and were used for nuclear transformation to transiently express these proteins in C. reinhardtii and C. vulgaris. The results showed that the geminiviral vector allowed the expression of both recombinant proteins in both algal species, with yields at 48 h posttransformation of up to 1.14 μg/g RBD and 1.61 ng/g FGF in C. vulgaris and 1.61 μg/g RBD and 1.025 ng/g FGF in C. reinhardtii. Thus, this study provides a proof of concept for the use of DNA viral vectors for the simple, rapid, and efficient production of recombinant proteins that repress the difficulties faced in the genetic transformation of these unicellular green microalgae. This concept opens an avenue to explore and optimize green microalgae as an ideal economically valuable platform for the production of therapeutic and industrially relevant recombinant proteins in shorter time periods with significant yields.","Malla, A.; Rosales-Mendoza, S.; Phoolcharoen, W.; Vimolmangkang, S.",Front Plant Sci,,12

Unknown is how the device's training parameters can be used to optimize movement variability and regularity. This study examined the effect of motor-assisted elliptical training speed as well as body weight support (BWS) on center of pressure (CoP) movement variability and regularity during training. METHODS: CoP was recorded using in-shoe pressure insoles as participants motor-assisted elliptical trained at three speeds (20, 40 and 60 cycles per minute) each performed at four BWS levels (0 %, 20 %, 40 %, and 60 %). Separate two-way repeated measures ANOVAs (3â¯×â¯4) evaluated impact of training speed and BWS on linear variability (standard deviation) and non-linear regularity (sample entropy) of CoP excursion (anterior-posterior, medial-lateral) for 10 dominant limb strides. FINDINGS: Training speed and BWS did not significantly affect the linear variability of CoP in the anterior-posterior or medial-lateral directions. However, sample entropy in both directions revealed the main effect of training speed (pâ¯<â¯0.0001), and a main effect of BWS was observed in the medial-lateral direction (pâ¯=â¯0.004). Faster training speeds and greater levels of BWS resulted in more irregular CoP patterns. INTERPRETATION: The finding that speed and BWS can be used to manipulate CoP movement variability when using a motor-assisted elliptical has significant clinical implications for promoting/restoring walking capacity. Further research is required to determine the impact of motor-assisted elliptical speed and BWS manipulations on functional recovery of walking in individuals who have experienced a neurologic injury or illness.","Fallahtafti, Farahnaz; Pfeifer, Chase M; Buster, Thad W; Burnfield, Judith M",Gait Posture,,12

With the exponential increase in the number of COVID-19 patients, there is a high possibility that the physicians and health care workers will not be able to cover all of these cases. Thus, computer scientists should contribute in this struggle against COVID-19 by introducing more intelligent solutions to achieve a rapid control of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to provide analysis for the current literature along with discussing the possible applicability for the available ideas that utilize AI to prevent and control COVID-19 showing how the current systems may be of use in a particular area to build a comprehensive view. This can be of great help to many healthcare administrators, computer scientists, and policy makers around the world. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of articles that utilize MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Embase and Web of Knowledge databases to formulate a comprehensive view that summarize different ideas about the most recent approaches to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 using AI. RESULTS: Our search identified the 10 most recent artificial intelligence approaches, which were suggested to be able to give the best solutions for maximizing safety and preventing the spread of COVID-19. The approaches included detection of suspected cases, large scale screening, monitoring, interactions with experimental therapies, screening pneumonia, internet of intelligent things for data and information, resources allocation, predictions, modeling and simulation, and robotics for medical quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that the most approaches which almost have none or very few studies are the usage of AI for COVID-19 interactions with experimental therapies, usage of AI for resources allocation to COVID-19 patients, and usage of AI and internet of intelligent things for COVID-19 data and information. However, other approaches including usage of AI for COVID-19 predictions, usage of AI for COVID-19 modeling and simulation, and usage of AI robotics for medical quarantine should be furtherly emphasized to be adopted by researchers since these important approaches lack sufficient number of studies. Therefore, our recommendation for computer scientists is to focus on these approaches that are still not being adequately covered.","Adly, Aya Sedky; Adly, Afnan Sedky; Adly, Mahmoud Sedky",J. med. internet res,,12
230942,Transcriptional Regulation of Thrombin-Induced Endothelial VEGF Induction and Proangiogenic Response,2021,"Caused by a novel type of virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) constitutes a global public health emergency. Pregnant women are considered to have a higher risk of severe morbidity and even mortality due to their susceptibility to respiratory pathogens and their particular immunologic state. Several studies assessing SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy reported adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with severe conditions, including spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, fetal distress, cesarean section, preterm birth, neonatal asphyxia, neonatal pneumonia, stillbirth, and neonatal death. However, whether these complications are causally related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not clear. Here, we reviewed the scientific evidence supporting the contributing role of Treg/Th17 cell imbalance in the uncontrolled systemic inflammation characterizing severe cases of COVID-19. Based on the recognized harmful effects of these CD4+ T-cell subset imbalances in pregnancy, we speculated that SARS-CoV-2 infection might lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes through the deregulation of otherwise tightly regulated Treg/Th17 ratios, and to subsequent uncontrolled systemic inflammation. Moreover, we discuss the possibility of vertical transmission of COVID-19 from infected mothers to their infants, which could also explain adverse perinatal outcomes. Rigorous monitoring of pregnancies and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent and treat early eventual maternal and perinatal complications.","Muyayalo, Kahinho P; Huang, Dong-Hui; Zhao, Si-Jia; Xie, Ting; Mor, Gil; Liao, Ai-Hua",Am J Reprod Immunol,,12

231324,Viral Infections and the Development of Disinfection: 100 Years of Progress at I&ECR,2020,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide. Most of the initial infection cases manifest as acute epithelial keratitis. Reactivation of herpesviruses is common in critically ill patients, including patients with severe Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, the data on COVID-19-related ocular infections is sparse, despite recent observations that more than 30% of COVID-19-infected patients had ocular manifestations. We report five cases of HSV-1 keratitis in COVID-19 patients. In total, five COVID-19 patients underwent ophthalmic examination, showing similar symptoms, including photophobia, tearing, decreased vision, eye redness, and pain. After initial assessment, tests of visual acuity and corneal sensitivity, a fluorescein staining test, and complete anterior and posterior segment examinations were performed. A diagnosis of HSV-1 keratitis was confirmed in all cases. Therapy was initiated using a local and systemic antiviral approach together with local antibiotic and mydriatic therapy. The complete reduction of keratitis symptoms and a clear cornea was achieved in all patients within 2 weeks. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a risk factor for developing HSV-1 keratitis, or it may act as a potential activator of this ocular disease.","Majtanova, Nora; Kriskova, Petra; Keri, Petra; Fellner, Zlatica; Majtan, Juraj; Kolar, Petr",Medicina (Kaunas),,12

The World Stroke Organization (WSO) has raised concerns due to the lack of available care and compromised acute stroke services globally. The numbers of thrombolysis and thrombectomy therapies are declining. As well as, the rates and door-to treatment times for thrombolysis and thrombectomy therapies are increasing. The stroke units are being reallocated to serve COVID-19 patients, and stroke teams are being redeployed to COVID-19 centers. Covid 19 confirmed cases and deaths are rising day by day. This pandemic clearly threatened and threatening all stroke care achievements regionally. Managing stroke patients during this pandemic is even more challenging at our region. The Middle East and North Africa Stroke and Interventional Neurotherapies Organization (MENA-SINO) is the main stroke organization regionally. MENA-SINO urges the need to developing new strategies and recommendations for stroke care during this pandemic. This will require multiple channels of interventions and create a protective code stroke with fast triaging path. Developing and expanding the tele-stroke programs are urgently required. There is an urgent need for enhancing collaboration and cooperation between stroke expertise regionally and internationally. Integrating such measures will inevitably lead to an improvement and upgrading of the services to a satisfactory level.","Al Hashmi, Amal M; Ozdemir, Atilla Ozcan; Shuaib, Ashfaq; Al-Jehani, Hosam; Mansour, Ossama Yassin; Alhazzani, Adel; Aladhem, Farid; Farhoudi, Mehdi; John, Seby; Saqqur, Maher",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,12
232786,Genetic-Code-Expansion Strategies for Vaccine Development,2020,"Background & objectives: An outbreak of respiratory illness of unknown aetiology was reported from Hubei province of Wuhan, People's Republic of China, in December 2019. The outbreak was attributed to a novel coronavirus (CoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and the disease as COVID-19. Within one month, cases were reported from 25 countries. In view of the novel viral strain with reported high morbidity, establishing early countrywide diagnosis to detect imported cases became critical. Here we describe the role of a countrywide network of VRDLs in early diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, established screening as well as confirmatory assays for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 13 VRDLs were provided with the E gene screening real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. VRDLs were selected on the basis of their presence near an international airport/seaport and their past performance. The case definition for testing included all individuals with travel history to Wuhan and symptomatic individuals with travel history to other parts of China. This was later expanded to include symptomatic individuals returning from Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and South Korea. Results: Within a week of standardization of the test at NIV, all VRDLs could initiate testing for SARS-CoV-2. Till February 29, 2020, a total of 2,913 samples were tested. This included both 654 individuals quarantined in the two camps and others fitting within the case definition. The quarantined individuals were tested twice - at days 0 and 14. All tested negative on both occasions. Only three individuals belonging to different districts in Kerala were found to be positive. Interpretation & conclusions: Sudden emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential to cause a pandemic posed an unsurmountable challenge to the public health system of India. However, concerted efforts of various arms of the Government of India resulted in a well-coordinated action at each level. India has successfully demonstrated its ability to establish quick diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 at NIV, Pune, and the testing VRDLs.","Gupta, Nivedita; Potdar, Varsha; Praharaj, Ira; Giri, Sidhartha; Sapkal, Gajanan; Yadav, Pragya; Choudhary, Manohar Lal; Dar, Lalit; Sugunan, A P; Kaur, Harmanmeet; Munivenkatappa, Ashok; Shastri, Jayanthi; Kaveri, Krishnasamy; Dutta, Shanta; Malhotra, Bharti; Jain, Amita; Nagamani, Kammilli; Shantala, G B; Raut, Sharmila; Vegad, M M; Sharma, Ajanta; Choudhary, Aashish; Brijwal, Megha; Balakrishnan, Anukumar; Manjunatha, Jayaswamy; Pathak, Manish; Srinivasan, Sivasubramanian; Banu, Hasina; Sharma, Himanshu; Jain, Parul; Sunita, Pakalpati; Ambica, R; Fageria, Babita; Patel, Disha; Rajbongshi, Gitika; Vijay, Neetu; Narayan, Jitendra; Aggarwal, Neeraj; Nagar, Anu; Gangakhedkar, Raman R; Abraham, Priya",Indian J Med Res,,12

Traditional modes of knowledge dissemination have not been feasible. A rapid solution was needed to share guidance and implementation examples among the global Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) community. We designed the IPC Global Webinar Series to bring together subject matter experts and IPC professionals in the fight against COVID-19. METHODS: The Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) model was adapted to create an interactive global knowledge network. Speakers and panelists provided presentations and answers to questions from participants. The webinars were simultaneously interpreted to five languages and recorded for later access. RESULTS: Thirteen webinar sessions were completed from May 14 through August 6, 2020. On average, 634 participants attended each session (range: 393 - 1,181). Each session was represented by participants from an average of over 100 countries; sessions 1-3 had participation from approximate 120 countries, and sessions 6 and 12 had participation from approximately 80 countries. DISCUSSION: The IPC Global Webinar Series shared critical information and promoted peer-to-peer learning during the COVID-19 pandemic response. The webinar sessions reached a broader audience than many in-person events. The webinar series was rapidly scaled and can be rapidly re-activated as needed. Our lessons learned in designing and implementing the series can inform design of other global health virtual knowledge networks. The continued and expanded use of adapted virtual communities of practice and other learning networks for the IPC community can serve as a valuable tool for addressing COVID-19 and other infectious disease threats.","Wilson, Kathryn; Dennison, Cori; Struminger, Bruce; Armistad, Amy; Osuka, Hanako; Montoya, Eva; Padoveze, Maria Clara; Arora, Sanjeev; Park, Benjamin; Lessa, Fernanda C",Clin. infect. dis,,12
233292,Natural product emerging as potential sars spike glycoproteins-ace2 inhibitors to combat COVID-19 attributed by in-silico investigations,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Children admitted with stridor and respiratory distress comprise a complex patient group that requires the otolaryngologist to decide when to assess and intervene with direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (DLB). Historically, the diagnosis of viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) can lead to postponement of surgery due to concerns of perioperative complications related to acute illness. Respiratory viral panels (RVP) are often used to confirm the presence of recent or active viral infection and can affect the differential diagnosis of upper airway obstruction. This study examined whether positive RVP testing is associated with perioperative complications and operative findings in pediatric patients undergoing inpatient DLB. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 132 pediatric patient encounters was performed. Viral testing results, DLB indication, DLB findings, and perioperative complications were compared. RESULTS: Sixty encounters (45.5%) involved a positive RVP, and 72 (54.5%) involved a negative RVP. Those with positive RVP were less likely to have a preoperative structural airway diagnosis (P =.0250) and more likely to have a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections (P =.0464). The most common reason for DLB was the need to assess the airway due to concern for structural pathology. Anatomic abnormalities were seen in a majority of encounters (77.3%) Laryngospasm occurred in 1 (1.7%) RVP positive and 1 (1.4%) RVP negative encounter, and 2 (2.8%) RVP negative encounters required reintubation. No other major complications were observed. No association was noted between RVP results and incidence of major or minor complication. CONCLUSIONS: Major perioperative complications after surgical intervention with DLB for the management of complex, inpatient children with stridor and respiratory distress are rare. RVP positivity, specific pathogens identified on RVP, and presence of URI symptoms were not associated with perioperative complications.","Niermeyer, Weston L; Ball, Jessica; Worobetz, Noah; Bourgeois, Tran; Onwuka, Amanda; Burrier, Candice; Chiang, Tendy",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,,12

236221,High Contrast Probe Cleavage Detection,2020-07-15,"Outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) plays a pivotal role in the strategy to build a high-level and open economy. This research used spatial panel models and data from 30 provinces in China from 2004 to 2017 to empirically analyse the relationship between OFDI and air pollution. The results revealed that, first, China's air pollution showed two spatial clustering areas: the eastern coastal area (e.g. Zhejiang) and the north-western area (e.g. Xinjiang). Second, with the increase in OFDI, the direct effect on the concentration of respirable suspended particulate matter (PM10) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) was negative, and the direct effect on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was positive; however, the total effect was negative. An increase of 1% in OFDI would directly decrease the concentrations of PM10 and SO2 by 0.024% and 0.096%, respectively, while NO2 would directly increase by 0.061%, but the total effect of OFDI on the three air pollutants was negative. Third, the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis existed between economic growth and SO2 and NO2 but not between economic growth and PM10. The spatial panel model results revealed that the spatial spillover effects of air pollutants (i.e. PM10, SO2, and NO2) were 0.494, 0.447 and 0.314, respectively. Moreover, the impact of OFDI on air pollution had significant temporal heterogeneity. To make the results robust, this research conducted a robustness test by replacing the spatial weight matrix and dependent variables. Finally, the conclusion of this article demonstrates the importance of OFDI in improving air pollution, and we could benefit from OFDI. Our research conclusions provide an important reference for policymakers in implementing trade policies and improving air pollution.","Zhou, Anhua; Li, Jun",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

METHODS: Four Super League matches in which SARS-CoV-2 positive players were subsequently found to have participated were analysed. Players were identified as increased-risk contacts, and player interactions and proximities were analysed by video footage and global positioning system (GPS) data. The primary outcome was new positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 within 14 days of the match in increased-risk contacts and other players participating in the matches. RESULTS: Out of 136 total players, there were 8 SARS-CoV-2 positive players, 28 players identified as increased-risk contacts and 100 other players in the matches. Increased-risk contacts and other players were involved in 11.4±9.0 (maximum 32) and 4.0±5.2 (maximum 23) tackles, respectively. From GPS data, increased-risk contacts and other players were within 2 m of SARS-CoV-2 positive players on 10.4±18.0 (maximum 88) and 12.5±20.7 (maximum 121) occasions, totalling 65.7±137.7 (maximum 689) and 89.5±169.4 (maximum 1003) s, respectively. Within 14 days of the match, one increased-risk contact and five players returned positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) tests, and 27 increased-risk contacts and 95 other participants returned negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests. Positive cases were most likely traced to social interactions, car sharing and wider community transmission and not linked to in-match transmission. CONCLUSION: Despite tackle involvements and close proximity interactions with SARS-CoV-2 positive players, in-match SARS-CoV-2 transmission was not confirmed. While larger datasets are needed, these findings suggest rugby presents a lower risk of viral transmission than previously predicted.","Jones, Ben; Phillips, Gemma; Kemp, Simon; Payne, Brendan; Hart, Brian; Cross, Matthew; Stokes, Keith A",Br. j. sports med,,12

Unfortunately, this practice may put black people at elevated risk for being seen as potential threats by some Americans. In this study, we evaluate whether and how different types of masks affect perceptions of black and white male models. We find that non-black respondents perceive a black male model as more threatening and less trustworthy when he is wearing a bandana or a cloth mask than when he is not wearing his face covering-especially those respondents who score above average in racial resentment, a common measure of racial bias. When he is wearing a surgical mask, however, they do not perceive him as more threatening or less trustworthy. Further, it is not that non-black respondents find bandana and cloth masks problematic in general. In fact, the white model in our study is perceived more positively when he is wearing all types of face coverings.

Yet, older adults may be uniquely able to cope given their life experiences and coping mechanisms. This study explores older adults' coping experiences and strategies during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Midwestern sample of 76 older adults aged 70-97 completed a phone interview about their experiences with social distancing due to COVID-19. Interviews were conducted during early weeks of regional social distancing (March 28-April 20, 2020). Participants rated their level of perceived coping and responded to open-ended questions about their daily life and coping. RESULTS: Mean perceived coping level (on a scale from 1-10) was 7.9, with 87% of participants rating their coping positively. Primary themes that emerged included: 1) staying busy, 2) seeking social support, and 3) having a positive mindset. These emotion-focused coping strategies appeared adaptive in the early weeks of the pandemic for most older adults. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Contrary to predominant messaging about the vulnerability of older adults, these findings highlight the resilient nature of older adults in terms of their psychological coping and adaptability during COVID-19. Future research should build upon these findings to better understand and promote late-life coping during crises. Practitioners should seek to support older adults' engagement in such proactive coping, and social policies should be developed to acknowledge the variable needs of older adults.","Fuller, Heather R; Huseth-Zosel, Andrea",GerontologistGerontologist,,12

Infected individuals with suspected (clinical diagnosis) or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited. Patients completed a survey-based questionnaire with the aim of assessing their epidemiological and clinical characteristics, general otorhinolaryngological symptoms, and smell and taste disorders. A total of 294 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 completed the survey (147 females). The most prevalent general symptoms included fever, myalgia, cough, and headache. A total of 70.4% and 59.2% of patients reported smell and taste disorders, respectively. A significant association between the two above-mentioned disorders was found (rs: 0.412; P < .001). Smell disorders occurred before the other symptoms in 11.6% of patients and was not significantly associated with nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea. Interestingly, our statistical analysis did not show any significant difference, either for general symptoms or otorhinolaryngological features, between the clinical diagnosis group and the laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (polymerase chain reaction) group. The structural equation model confirmed significant standardized paths (P < .05) between general symptoms, comorbidities, and general otorhinolaryngological complaints in the absence of a significant correlation between these elements and smell and taste alterations. The prevalence of smell and taste disorders in mild-to-moderate Italian COVID-19 patients is significant both in suspected and laboratory-confirmed cases and reveals a strong correlation between these clinical signs regardless of the presence of general or otorhinolaryngological symptoms, such as nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea.","Barillari, Maria Rosaria; Bastiani, Luca; Lechien, Jerome R; Mannelli, Giuditta; Molteni, Gabriele; Cantarella, Giovanna; Coppola, Nicola; Costa, Giuseppe; Trecca, Eleonora M C; Grillo, Calogero; La Mantia, Ignazio; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M; Vicini, Claudio; Saussez, Sven; Nacci, Andrea; Cammaroto, Giovanni",J. med. virol,,12

Although there are a number of issues to be considered, the following points are most urgent: The potential for domesticated (companion) animals to serve as a reservoir of infection contributing to continued human-to-human disease, infectivity, and community spread. The ramifications to food security, economy, and trade issues should coronavirus establish itself within livestock and poultry. The disruption to national security if SARS-CoV-2 and its fairly well-established effects on smell (hyposmia/anosmia) to critical military service animals including explosive detector dog, narcotics detector dog, specialized search dog, combat tracker dog, mine detection dog, tactical explosive detector dog, improvised explosive device detector dog, patrol explosive detector dog, and patrol narcotics detector dog, as well as multipurpose canines used by special operations such as used by the U.S. customs and border protection agency (e.g., Beagle Brigade). This article presents in chronological order data that both individually (as received independently from multiple countries) and collectively urge studies that elucidate the following questions. 1.What animal species can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the likely sources of infection, the period of infectivity, and transmissibility between these animals and to other animal species and humans? 2.What are the best diagnostic tests currently available for companion animals and livestock? 3.What expressions of illness in companion and other animal species can serve as disease markers? Although it is recognized that robust funding and methodology need to be identified to apply the best scientific investigation into these issues, there may be easily identifiable opportunities to capture information that can guide decision and study. First, it may be possible to quickly initiate a data collection strategy using in-place animal gatekeepers, such as zookeepers, veterinarians, kennel owners, feed lots, and military animal handlers. If provided a simple surveillance form, their detection of symptoms (lethargy, hyposmia, anosmia, and others) might be quickly reported to a central data collection site if one were created. Second, although current human COVID-19 disease is aligning around areas of population density and cluster events, it might be possible to overlay animal species density or veterinary reports that could signal some disease association in animals with COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, although companion animals and zoo species have repeatedly served as sentinels for emerging infectious diseases, they do not currently fall under the jurisdiction of any federal agency and are not under surveillance.","McNamara, Tracey; Richt, Juergen A; Glickman, Larry",Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,,12

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted on pregnant women with COVID-19. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of a nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimen was used for the diagnosis. Initial Ct values for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR tests were recorded. 22.9 was the 50th percentile Ct value of the study population. The study population was divided into two groups based on their Ct values: (1) Cases with Higher Ct values (Ct > 22.9)(n = 50) and (2) Cases with lower Ct values (Ct &#8804; 22.9)(n = 55). Demographic features, clinical characteristics, disease progression, laboratory test results and pregnancy outcomes were compared between the groups. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the performance of Ct values in predicting obstetric complications. RESULTS: Obstetric complication rate was significantly higher in cases with lower Ct values (p < .001). A significantly lower lymphocyte count together with higher ESR, procalcitonin and IL-6 values were observed in the cases with lower Ct values (p > .05). Additionally, a significantly higher NICU admission rate and longer hospital stays were present in the cases with lower Ct values (p > .05). The value in ROC curves with the best balance of sensitivity/specificity was 22.5 (85.7% sensitivity, 63.6% specificity). CONCLUSION: Lower Ct values may be associated with an increased rate of obstetric complications in pregnant women with COVID-19. Physicians should be cautious in the management of cases with Ct levels below 22.5.","Tanacan, Atakan; Anuk, Ali Taner; Erol, Seyit Ahmet; Keskin, Huseyin Levent; Altinboga, Orhan; Yakistiran, Betul; Aydogan, Sibel; Unlu, Serpil; Eyi, Elif Gul Yapar; Tayman, Cuneyt; Dinc, Bedia; Sahin, Dilek; Moraloglu Tekin, Ozlem",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,12

Viral antigens and damage-associated molecular patterns released from injured and infected cells activate MSCs, which elicit strong antiviral immune response. MSC-sourced interferons and inflammatory cytokines modulate the cytotoxicity of NK cells and CTLs, enhance the antigen-presentation properties of DCs and macrophages, regulate cytokine synthesis in CD4+ T helper cells and promote antibody production in B cells. After the elimination of viral pathogens, MSCs produce immunoregulatory cytokines and trophic factors, prevent the over-activation of immune cells and promote tissue repair and regeneration. In this review article, we summarize the current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the MSC-dependent elimination of virus-infected cells, and we emphasize the therapeutic potential of MSCs and their secretomes in the treatment of viral diseases.","Harrell, Carl Randall Biljana Popovska Jovicic Djonov Valentin Volarevic Vladislav",Pathogens,,12

While the risk factors of COVID-19 are still under investigation, environmental factors, such as urban air pollution, may play an important role in increasing population susceptibility to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional nationwide study using zero-inflated negative binomial models to estimate the association between long-term (2010-2016) county-level exposures to NO2, PM2.5 and O3 and county-level COVID-19 case-fatality and mortality rates in the US. We used both single and multipollutant models and controlled for spatial trends and a comprehensive set of potential confounders, including state-level test positive rate, county-level healthcare capacity, phase-of-epidemic, population mobility, population density, sociodemographics, socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity, behavioral risk factors, and meteorology. Results: 3,659,828 COVID-19 cases and 138,552 deaths were reported in 3,076 US counties from January 22, 2020 to July 17, 2020, with an overall observed case-fatality rate of 3.8%. County-level average NO2 concentrations were positively associated with both COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate in single-, bi-, and tri-pollutant models. When adjusted for co-pollutants, per inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in NO2 (4.6 ppb), COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate were associated with an increase of 11.3% (95% CI 4.9% to 18.2%) and 16.2% (95% CI 8.7% to 24.0%), respectively. We did not observe significant associations between COVID-19 case-fatality rate and long-term exposure to PM2.5 or O3, although per IQR increase in PM2.5 (2.6 ug/m3) was marginally associated with 14.9% (95% CI: 0.0% to 31.9%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate when adjusted for co-pollutants. Discussion: Long-term exposure to NO2, which largely arises from urban combustion sources such as traffic, may enhance susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes, independent of long-term PM2.5 and O3 exposure. The results support targeted public health actions to protect residents from COVID-19 in heavily polluted regions with historically high NO2 levels. Continuation of current efforts to lower traffic emissions and ambient air pollution may be an important component of reducing population-level risk of COVID-19 case-fatality and mortality.","Liang, Donghai; Shi, Liuhua; Zhao, Jingxuan; Liu, Pengfei; Sarnat, Jeremy A; Gao, Song; Schwartz, Joel; Liu, Yang; Ebelt, Stefanie T; Scovronick, Noah; Chang, Howard H",Innovation (N Y),,12
251861,Identification of corona virus infection in people infected with SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Although 1st and 2nd generation supraglottic airway devices (SADs) have many desirable features, they are nevertheless inserted in a similar 'blind' way as their 1st generation predecessors. Clinicians mostly still rely entirely on subjective indirect assessments to estimate correct placement which supposedly ensures a tight seal. Malpositioning and potential airway compromise occurs in more than half of placements. Vision-guided insertion can improve placement. In this article we propose the development of a 3rd generation supraglottic airway device, equipped with cameras and fiberoptic illumination, to visualise insertion of the device, enable immediate manoeuvres to optimise SAD position, verify whether correct 1st and 2nd seals are achieved and check whether size selected is appropriate. We do not provide technical details of such a '3rd generation' device, but rather present a theoretical analysis of its desirable properties, which are essential to overcome the remaining limitations of current 1st and 2nd generation devices. We also recommend that this further milestone improvement, i.e. ability to place the SAD accurately under direct vision, be eligible for the moniker '3rd generation'. Blind insertion of SADs should become the exception and we anticipate, as in other domains such as central venous cannulation and nerve block insertions, vision-guided placement becoming the gold standard.","Van Zundert, André A J; Kumar, Chandra M; Van Zundert, Tom C R V; Gatt, Stephen P; Pandit, Jaideep J",J. clin. monit. comput,,12
252199,Integrated multi-omics analysis of ovarian cancer using variational autoencoders,2021,"Untoward effector CD4+ T cell responses are kept in check by immune regulatory mechanisms mediated by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. CD4+ T helper 17 (Th17) cells, characterized by IL-17 production, play important roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases (such as arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, among others) and in the host response to infection and cancer. Here, we demonstrate that human CD4+ T cells cells exposed to a Th17-differentiating milieu are significantly more resistant to immune suppression by CD8+ T cells compared to control Th0 cells. This resistance is mediated, in part, through the action of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17AF heterodimer through their receptors (IL-17RA and IL-17RC) on CD4+ T cells themselves, but not through their action on CD8+ T cells or APC. We further show that IL-17 can directly act on non-Th17 effector CD4+ T cells to induce suppressive resistance, and this resistance can be reversed by blockade of IL-1ß, IL-6, or STAT3. These studies reveal a role for IL-17 cytokines in mediating CD4-intrinsic immune resistance. The pathways induced in this process may serve as a critical target for future investigation and immunotherapeutic intervention.","Crawford, Michael P; Sinha, Sushmita; Renavikar, Pranav S; Borcherding, Nicholas; Karandikar, Nitin J",Proc.

Vectors corresponding to amino acid substitutions are classified based on whether they are accessible via a single-nucleotide mutation. It is shown that the standard genetic code establishes a ""choice architecture"" that permits nearly independent tuning of the properties related with size and those related with hydrophobicity. This work sheds light on the metarules of evolvability that may have shaped the standard genetic code to increase the probability that adaptive point mutations will be generated. Illustrations of the usefulness of visualizing amino acid substitutions in a 3D physicochemical space are shown using recent datasets collected regarding the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain. First, the substitutions most responsible for antibody escape are almost always inaccessible via single nucleotide mutation, and also change multiple properties concurrently. Second, it is shown that assays of ACE2 binding by sarbecovirus variants, including the viruses responsible for SARS and COVID-19, are more easily understood when plotted with this method. The results of this research can extend our understanding of certain hereditary disorders caused by point mutations, as well as guide the development of rational protein and vaccine design.

This study aimed to provide epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia and to determine whether characteristic profiles differ between patients who are symptomatic vs. asymptomatic for the disease. The first 492 consecutive patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Saudi Arabia between March and September 2020 were included in this study. An electronic case report form developed using REDCap was used to collect data for each patient, including demographic characteristics, virus exposure (travel history, and human and animal contact), vaccination history, comorbidities, signs and symptoms, laboratory and radiographic reports, cardiac workup, medications, treatment regimens, and patient outcome. This patient cohort was 54% male, with 20.4% aged more than 60 years, 19.9% aged 31 to 40 years, and 17% aged 41 to 50 years. Most patients (79.2%) were symptomatic. Variables that significantly differed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were age, blood oxygen saturation percentage, hemoglobin level, lymphocyte count, neutrophil to lymphocyte (NTL) ratio, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level. Asymptomatic patients were mostly younger, with lower body mass index and ALT and AST levels but higher lymphocyte counts, NTL ratio, and CD4, CD8, natural killer cell, IgG, and IgM levels. The median incubation period reported for this cohort was 16 day, with upper and lower 95% quartiles of 27 and 10 days, respectively. Factors associated with increased risk of mortality were age (older than 42 years) and comorbidities, including specifically diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Patients who were not given an antiviral regimen were associated with better prognosis than patients who received an antiviral regimen (HR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.011-0.25). Similar to countries worldwide, Saudi Arabia has explored treatment options to save the lives of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Several studies have established that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible than pre-existing variants, but have not identified whether it leads to any change in disease severity2. Here we analyse a dataset that links 2,245,263 positive SARS-CoV-2 community tests and 17,452 deaths associated with COVID-19 in England from 1 November 2020 to 14 February 2021. For 1,146,534 (51%) of these tests, the presence or absence of B.1.1.7 can be identified because mutations in this lineage prevent PCR amplification of the spike (S) gene target (known as S gene target failure (SGTF)1). On the basis of 4,945 deaths with known SGTF status, we estimate that the hazard of death associated with SGTF is 55% (95% confidence interval, 39-72%) higher than in cases without SGTF after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, residence in a care home, the local authority of residence and test date. This corresponds to the absolute risk of death for a 55-69-year-old man increasing from 0.6% to 0.9% (95% confidence interval, 0.8-1.0%) within 28 days of a positive test in the community. Correcting for misclassification of SGTF and missingness in SGTF status, we estimate that the hazard of death associated with B.1.1.7 is 61% (42-82%) higher than with pre-existing variants. Our analysis suggests that B.1.1.7 is not only more transmissible than pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 variants, but may also cause more severe illness.","Davies, Nicholas G; Jarvis, Christopher I; Edmunds, W John; Jewell, Nicholas P; Diaz-Ordaz, Karla; Keogh, Ruth H",Nature,,12

There is a paucity of information on glycemic control among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes and acute hyperglycemia. METHODS: This retrospective observational study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 adults evaluated glycemic and clinical outcomes in patients with and without diabetes and/or acutely uncontrolled hyperglycemia hospitalized March 1 to April 6, 2020. Diabetes was defined as A1C &#8805;6.5%. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia was defined as &#8805;2 blood glucoses (BGs) > 180 mg/dL within any 24-hour period. Data were abstracted from Glytec's data warehouse. RESULTS: Among 1122 patients in 88 U.S. hospitals, 451 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia spent 37.8% of patient days having a mean BG > 180 mg/dL. Among 570 patients who died or were discharged, the mortality rate was 28.8% in 184 diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia patients, compared with 6.2% of 386 patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia (P < .001). Among the 184 patients with diabetes and/or hyperglycemia who died or were discharged, 40 of 96 uncontrolled hyperglycemia patients (41.7%) died compared with 13 of 88 patients with diabetes (14.8%, P < .001). Among 493 discharged survivors, median length of stay (LOS) was longer in 184 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia compared with 386 patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia (5.7 vs 4.3 days, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia occurred frequently. These COVID-19 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia had a longer LOS and markedly higher mortality than patients without diabetes or uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Patients with uncontrolled hyperglycemia had a particularly high mortality rate.

METHODOLOGY: All patients confirmed as having COVID-19 between 23 January and 25 March 2020 by RT-PCR assay in the clinical lab of Shantou CDC were included and divided into three groups based on the source of identification: hospital diagnosis, contact tracing, and community screening. Collected data was analyzed and compared among these three groups. RESULTS: A total of 25 COVID-19 cases were identified in Shantou. The first case was identified on 14 January 2020 at one of two COVID-19 dedicated hospitals in Shantou. The majority of the cases were either imported from Wuhan or linked to Wuhan/Hubei. The median lag time for diagnosis (i.e., the time between symptom onset and case confirmation) was 2 days (IQR, 2.0-4.0) for all cases, 9 days (IQR, 7.0-10.0) for the cases diagnosed in hospitals, 2 days (IQR, 1.5-2.0) for the cases in contact tracing, and 4 days (IQR, 2.5-4.5) for cases in community screening, with a significantly longer diagnosis lag time in hospitals (p = 0.003). Multivariate linear regression models showed larger family size and severe cases as the significant predictor for increasing number of close contacts. CONCLUSIONS: The current pandemic appears to exist for an uncertain period. The early containment measures applied in Shantou, a city with insufficient healthcare resources for COVID-19, seems to be appropriate for cities or areas with similar profiles.","Zhang, Xubin; Zhang, Dangui; Zhang, Chi; Yao, Lijun; Xu, Lu; Chen, Gengna; Liao, Zhaohui; Zhu, Xunyi; Yang, Wenda; Li, Weinan",J Infect Dev Ctries,,12

However, patients who continued ACEi/ARBs in the hospital had a markedly lower ICU admission rate (12% vs 26%; Pâ =â .001; odds ratio [OR]â =â 0.347; 95% confidence interval [CI], .187-.643) and mortality rate (6% vs 28%; Pâ =â .001; ORâ =â 0.215; 95% CI, .101-.455) compared to patients who discontinued ACEi/ARB. The odds ratio for mortality remained significantly lower after accounting for development of hypotension or AKI. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that continued ACEi/ARB use in hypertensive COVID-19 patients yields better clinical outcomes.","Lam, Katherine W; Chow, Kenneth W; Vo, Jonathan; Hou, Wei; Li, Haifang; Richman, Paul S; Mallipattu, Sandeep K; Skopicki, Hal A; Singer, Adam J; Duong, Tim Q",J Infect Dis,,12

264822,The accuracy of auditory spatial judgments in the visually impaired is dependent on sound source distance,2020,"Background: Abortion is an essential service, the need for which has increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Because of the lockdowns at several periods, these services were hampered. This study analyzed the pattern of Safe Abortion Services (SAS) at a tertiary healthcare center during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal. Methods: This is a cross-sectional analytical study. We compared the pattern of safe abortion services between the first three months of the pandemic when a lockdown was implemented and the second three months when the lockdown was eased. Demographic and obstetric profile of women, their abortion choices, method of termination, difficulty in accessibility, and level of psychological distress were studied. Results: A total of 52 women were provided SAS during the study period. The number of women coming for SAS during lockdown was 47.1% less than that after easing of the lockdown. During the lockdown, women came at a later period of gestation with a mean of 9.5 weeks compared to 7.5 weeks in the later three months. Because of fear of COVID-19, 19.2% (n=10) women opted for termination of pregnancy. Increased need of contraception was felt but 40% (n=12) had problems of accessibility. More women had probable serious mental illness during the lockdown period (p=0.008). Conclusion:Lockdown during the pandemic decreased the number of women coming for SAS due to barriers in accessibility. Contraceptive needs are also increased but access is difficult. The need for safe abortion services and contraception has increased during the pandemic but the lockdown caused inaccessibility. Psychological distress is prevalent, and fear of COVID-19 has become a common reason for termination of pregnancy. This pandemic can be taken as an opportunity to provide and improve contraception and abortion accessibility, and quality with integration of mental health support.","Aryal, Shreyashi Nepal Samata Ballav Pant Sagun",,,12
266554,Preparing for the next infectious disease pandemic,2020,"Genioplasty is the main way to treat diseases such as chin asymmetry, dysplasia and overdevelopment, which involve the three-dimensional direction abnormalities of the chin. Since this kind of surgery mainly uses intraoral incisions, the narrow surgical field of intraoral incisions and the surrounding important neurovascular tissues make it easy for complications, to occur during the osteotomy process, which results in greater surgical risks. The first craniofacial-plastic surgical robot (CPSR-I) system is developed to complete the precise positioning and improve the surgeon's force perception ability. The Kalman filtering method is adopted to reduce the interference of sensor signal noise. An adaptive fuzzy control system, which has strong robustness and adaptability to the environment, is designed to improve the stability of robot-assisted surgical operations. To solve the problem of the depth perception, we propose an automatic bone drilling control strategy that combines position and force conditions to ensure that the robot can automatically stop when the bone is penetrated. On the basis of model surgery and animal experiments, preliminary experiments were carried out clinically. Based on the early results of 6 patients, the robot-assisted approach appears to be a safe and effective strategy for genioplasty.","Lin, Li; Xu, Cheng; Shi, Yunyong; Zhou, Chaozheng; Zhu, Ming; Chai, Gang; Xie, Le",Sci Rep,,12

272948,Dysregulation of COVID-19 related gene expression in the COPD lung,2021,"Background: Little is known about electronic consultation (e-consult) utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic when health systems rapidly implemented and scaled telehealth alternatives to in-person care. It is also unknown if e-consult utilization during the pandemic replaced or merely deferred the need for a specialty appointment. We evaluated if primary care providers' (PCPs) e-consult utilization and specialists' recommendations for specialty appointments changed after the transition to telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cohort study used an interrupted time series analysis of e-consult utilization in a large, urban academic health care system between December 1, 2019, and June 27, 2020; the post-telemedicine time period began March 15, 2020. The primary outcome measure was the odds of an e-consult ordered during a PCP appointment; the secondary outcome measure was the odds of a specialist recommending a specialty appointment in an e-consult. Results: During 193,263 PCP appointments, 1,318 e-consults were placed to internal medicine subspecialties. Compared to the pre-telemedicine time period, the odds of a PCP ordering an e-consult increased (OR 1.04, 95% CI [1.02-1.07]) and the odds of specialists recommending specialty appointments increased (OR 1.11, 95% CI [1.06-1.15]). Conclusions: E-consult use increased following the transition to telemedicine in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that PCPs consider the e-consult a valuable tool for patient care when there is limited availability of specialty appointments. However, recommendations for specialty appointments following an e-consult also increased, suggesting that the e-consult may not replace the need for a specialty appointment.","Leyton, Christopher; Zhang, Chenshu; Rikin, Sharon",Telemed. j. e. health,,12

The prevalence of bacterial infection in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood. AIMS: To determine the prevalence of bacterial co-infection (at presentation) and secondary infection (after presentation) in patients with COVID-19. SOURCES: We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, OVID Epub and EMBASE databases for English language literature from 2019 to April 16, 2020. Studies were included if they (a) evaluated patients with confirmed COVID-19 and (b) reported the prevalence of acute bacterial infection. CONTENT: Data were extracted by a single reviewer and cross-checked by a second reviewer. The main outcome was the proportion of COVID-19 patients with an acute bacterial infection. Any bacteria detected from non-respiratory-tract or non-bloodstream sources were excluded. Of 1308 studies screened, 24 were eligible and included in the rapid review representing 3338 patients with COVID-19 evaluated for acute bacterial infection. In the meta-analysis, bacterial co-infection (estimated on presentation) was identified in 3.5% of patients (95%CI 0.4-6.7%) and secondary bacterial infection in 14.3% of patients (95%CI 9.6-18.9%). The overall proportion of COVID-19 patients with bacterial infection was 6.9% (95%CI 4.3-9.5%). Bacterial infection was more common in critically ill patients (8.1%, 95%CI 2.3-13.8%). The majority of patients with COVID-19 received antibiotics (71.9%, 95%CI 56.1 to 87.7%). IMPLICATIONS: Bacterial co-infection is relatively infrequent in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The majority of these patients may not require empirical antibacterial treatment.","Langford, Bradley J; So, Miranda; Raybardhan, Sumit; Leung, Valerie; Westwood, Duncan; MacFadden, Derek R; Soucy, Jean-Paul R; Daneman, Nick",Clin. microbiol. infect,,12

Additionally, cancer follow-up or imaging appointments have been delayed in many clinics around the world. Postponement of routine screening exams will result in delays in new cancer diagnoses. Clinics are continuing to monitor and adapt their appointment schedules based on local outbreaks of COVID-19. Studies on COVID-19 in patients with cancer are limited, but consistently indicate that this population is at risk for more severe COVID-19 illness. Data from recent studies also suggest that pediatric patients with cancer have a lower risk of severe COVID-19 illness compared to adults. Certain features of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection detected by lung, brain, and gastrointestinal imaging may confound radiologists' interpretation of cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment response. Lastly, as clinics begin to re-open for routine appointments, protocols have been put in place to reduce SARS-CoV-2 exposure to patients during their visits.

We aimed to provide COVID-19-specific protocol optimization recommendations limiting US technologist exposure while optimizing patient selection. METHODS: A novel two-pronged algorithm was implemented to limit the DVT US studies on patients with COVID-19 prospectively, which included direct physician communication with the care team and a COVID-19-specific imaging protocol was instated to reduce US technologist exposure. To assess the pretest risk of DVT, the sensitivity and specificity of serum d-dimer in 500-unit increments from 500 to 8000 ng/mL and a receiver operating characteristic curve to assess performance of serum d-dimer in predicting DVT was generated. Rates of DVT, pulmonary embolism, and scan times were compared using t-test and Fisher's exact test (before and after implementation of the protocol). RESULTS: Direct physician communication resulted in cancellation or deferral of 72% of requested examinations in COVID-19-positive patients. A serum d-dimer of >4000 ng/mL yielded a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 70% (95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.86) for venous thromboembolism. Using the COVID-19-specific protocol, there was a significant (50%) decrease in the scan time (P < .0001) in comparison with the conventional protocol. CONCLUSIONS: A direct physician communication policy between imaging physician and referring physician resulted in deferral or cancellation of a majority of requested DVT US examinations. An abbreviated COVID-19-specific imaging protocol significantly decreased exposure time to the US technologist.","Dua, Anahita; Thondapu, Vikas; Rosovsky, Rachel; Hunt, David; Latz, Christopher; Waller, H David; Manchester, Scott; Patell, Rushad; Romero, Javier; Ghoshhajra, Brian; Eagleton, Matthew; Brink, James; Hedgire, Sandeep",J.

After a brief introduction, the article proceeds in six steps. In Part One, I describe the origins of the novel coronavirus in China, the actions taken there, and the fact that while the ban on domestic travel from Wuhan limited the degree of spread within China to cities like Beijing and Shanghai, it failed to prevent the virus's spread across the world and its march across the United States in the midst of denial, obfuscation, refusals to act, and delay. In Part Two, I explicate the various ways in which the United States was unprepared for the pandemic, focusing particularly on the lack of public health infrastructure, including the ability to mobilize supply lines, but also the breakdowns in hospitals and nursing homes, and importantly, the manner in which our continuing lack of a national health care system is part of our lack of preparedness. In Part Three, I describe how some other nations have had much greater success in staunching the outbreak, focusing particularly on Germany, as a liberal democracy in which civil liberty is respected. In Part Four, I take note of some of the complicated social, political, and cultural features that steer a pandemic, which is as much a biological as a social and cultural phenomenon: leadership;disparate interests, regional rivalries, and political structures;globalization;the role of the 24 / 7 news cycle;and finally, the importance of communal embrace of public health to minimize the need for coercive measures. In Part Five, I turn to the institutionalization and embodiment in the culture of selfishness in our system for financing and delivering health care, giving rise to a fragmented system of payment and delivery, along with massive concentration of economic power and separate, siloed networks, all reflected in and created by legal doctrine that itself is fragmented.

We included 102 unselected individuals with a diagnosis of TSC and/or LAM assessed between January 1, 2020 and April 24, 2020 (29% children, 71% adults). Twenty-six patients were on mTOR inhibitors. Demographic data, TSC manifestations, presence, and outcomes in individuals with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated. Health status and outcomes of all patients on mTOR inhibitors were assessed. One patient with severe TSC had polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, was admitted to ICU, and died. Nine additional patients either met the definition of suspect case or presented with at least two of the most common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All recovered fully. None of the patients treated with mTOR inhibitors for their underlying comorbidities was diagnosed with COVID-19, and those who showed suspicious respiratory symptoms recovered fully.

Unfortunately, no vaccine or antiviral drug that completely eliminates the transmissible disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been developed to date. Given that coronavirus nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) is a good target for attenuated vaccines, it is of great significance to explore the detailed characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1. Here, we first confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 had a conserved function similar to that of SARS-CoV nsp1 in inhibiting host-protein synthesis and showed greater inhibition efficiency, as revealed by ribopuromycylation and Renilla luciferase (Rluc) reporter assays. Specifically, bioinformatics and biochemical experiments showed that by interacting with 40S ribosomal subunit, the lysine located at amino acid 164 (K164) was the key residue that enabled SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 to suppress host gene expression. Furthermore, as an inhibitor of host-protein expression, SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 contributed to cell-cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, which might provide a favourable environment for virus production. Taken together, this research uncovered the detailed mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 K164 inhibited host gene expression, laying the foundation for the development of attenuated vaccines based on nsp1 modification.","Shen, Zhou; Zhang, Guangxu; Yang, Yilin; Li, Mengxia; Yang, Siqi; Peng, Guiqing",J. gen. virol,,12

Exploratory factor analysis was used to establish the construct validity of the scale, producing a 15-item scale with a one-dimensional structure that explained 34.36% of the variance. Confirmatory factor analysis using a different study group revealed that all items have significant t-values, and the model established according to model fit indexes has meaningful and acceptable fit values. The internal consistency of the scale results was calculated using the Cronbach Alpha coefficient, and a reliability of 0.85 in terms of internal consistency was obtained. Test-retest reliability results as another indicator of reliability were found to be 0.85. Scores on the Altruism Scale were compared with those on the SPS to evaluate the scale's criterion validity, and a significant relationship was found between the two scale scores.

The sea of scientific literature published over a short time-span to understand and mitigate this global phenomenon necessitates concerted efforts to organize our findings and focus on the unexplored facets of the disease. In this work, we applied natural language processing (NLP) based approaches on scientific literature published on COVID-19 to infer significant keywords that have contributed to our social, economic, demographic, psychological, epidemiological, clinical, and medical understanding of this pandemic. We identify key terms appearing in COVID literature that vary in representation when compared to other virus-borne diseases such as MERS, Ebola, and Influenza. We also identify countries, topics, and research articles that demonstrate that the scientific community is still reacting to the short-term threats such as transmissibility, health risks, treatment plans, and public policies, underpinning the need for collective international efforts towards long-term immunization and drug-related challenges.

280559,On iteratively regularized predictor-corrector algorithm for parameter identification,2020,"When discussing possible consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems certain that the effects of the pandemic will most likely magnify existing educational disparities in Europe and around the world. However, so far, little is known about how the conditions and consequences of distance learning intensify existing dynamics of educational inequalities. This paper aims at answering the question of how educational disadvantages in socially deprived settings are exacerbated through the pandemic. On this basis, it reflects on potential educational practices that can help countering these dynamics. For this study, interviews with teachers in socio-economically disadvantaged (n = 12) and in privileged settings (n = 4) were conducted, transcribed and investigated through qualitative data analysis. The data were categorized with reference to Pierre Bourdieu?s theory of capital to analyze and systematize the empirical results. Finally, a case study from the interview material offers options for action that can counteract a possible worsening of educational disadvantages and help (re-)think school and teaching based on the experiences gained during the lockdown.","Frohn, Julia",European Educational Research Journal,,12

By combining emerging knowledge of the pathological processes involved in COVID-19 with insights into the mechanisms underlying the adverse health consequences of obesity, we present some hypotheses regarding the deleterious impact of obesity on the course of COVID-19. These hypotheses are testable and could guide therapeutic and preventive interventions. As obesity is now almost ubiquitous and no vaccine for COVID-19 is currently available, even a modest reduction in the impact of obesity on mortality and morbidity from this viral infection could have profound consequences for public health.","Lockhart, Sam M; O039,; Rahilly, Stephen",,,12

One hundred ninety-four stool samples from calves with diarrhoea less than one-month old were collected from five different geographical regions of country in order to detect coronavirus and characterize it if coronavirus was found. Samples were screened for the presence of BCoV by using a commercially available ELISA kit. Furthermore, RT-PCR was carried out on positive samples for confirmation of the presence of N and S specific genes. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was carried out following RT-PCR tests. 7.2% of samples, were positive for BCoV and all stool samples from the South-West, Northeast and West regions of Iran were negative. The results showed that all the strains of coronavirus identified in Iran were completely in independent clusters and that they did not stand in the same cluster as any of the strains identified in other parts of the world. The strains from Iran were quite different from strains in other parts of the world but from the point of similarity these viruses showed some similarities to the European strains, such as those found in France, Croatia, Denmark and Sweden.","Lotfollahzadeh, Samad; Madadgar, Omid; Reza Mohebbi, Mohammad; Reza Mokhber Dezfouli, Mohammad; George Watson, David",Vet. med. sci,,12

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was carried out on 1991 semen samples collected between November 23, 2019 and July 23, 2020 (a period covering COVID-19 lock-down in China) from 781 sperm donor candidates at University-affiliated Sichuan Provincial Human Sperm Bank. Multivariate mixed-effects regression models were constructed to investigate the relationship between pollution exposure, windows of susceptibility, and semen quality, while controlling for biographic and meteorologic confounders. RESULT(S): The results indicated multiple windows of susceptibility for semen quality, especially sperm motility, due to ambient pollution exposure. Exposure to particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10), O3 and NO2 during late stages of spermatogenesis appeared to have weak but positive association with semen quality. Exposure to CO late in sperm development appeared to have inverse relationship with sperm movement parameters. Exposure to SO2 appeared to influence semen quality throughout spermatogenesis. CONCLUSION(S): Potential windows of susceptibility for semen quality varied depending on air pollutants. Sperm motility was sensitive to pollution exposure. Findings from current study further elucidate the importance of sensitive periods during spermatogenesis and provide new evidence for the determinants of male fertility.","Yang, Tingting; Deng, Li; Sun, Boyu; Zhang, Shifu; Xian, Yang; Xiao, Xiao; Zhan, Yu; Xu, Kehui; Buonocore, Johnathan J; Tang, Ya; Li, Fuping; Qiu, Yang",Environ Res,,12

Acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal emergency worldwide. Therefore, it is highly essential to assess the influence the pandemic has on acute appendicitis. AIM: To assess the efficacy of the management of acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 90 patients who presented with acute appendicitis during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Jiaxing, China. Clinical data regarding appendectomies patients were also collected for the corresponding time frame from 2019. Preoperative management, intraoperative protective measures, and postoperative management were conducted. RESULTS: After screening, six patients were identified as unqualified due to fever and were then referred to the COVID-19 expert group. The results of the nucleic acid test were negative. Of the 76 patients enrolled in the simple group, nine patients received medication therapy, and all others underwent surgery. From this same group, 66 patients were diagnosed with suppurative appendicitis, and one patient was diagnosed with perforated appendicitis after surgery. There were 14 patients in the complex group, for which the postoperative diagnosis indicated perforated appendicitis. The proportion of men with perforated appendicitis was higher than that in 2019 (P < 0.05). The chief complaint duration for perforated appendicitis patients in 2020 was longer than that in 2019 (P < 0.05). The routine blood test showed that white blood cell counts and neutrophil ratios were higher in perforated appendicitis patients in 2020 than in 2019 (P < 0.05). The ratio of open appendectomies to the amount of mean blood loss during surgery was greater in 2020 than in 2019 (P < 0.05). Online consultation after discharge was selected in 59 cases (65.6%). No perioperative infection with COVID-19 or long-term postoperative complications were found. CONCLUSION: The management of acute appendicitis from Jiaxing effectively reduced the influence of the pandemic and minimized the risk of nosocomial infection.","Zhou, Yuan; Cen, Lu-Sha",World J Clin Cases,,12
289933,"Benefits of tunnel handling persist after repeated restraint, injection and anaesthesia",2020,"Machine learning creates new opportunities to design digital health interventions for youth at risk for acquiring HIV (YARH), capitalizing on YARH's health information seeking on the internet. To date, researchers have focused on descriptive analyses that associate individual factors with health-seeking behaviors, without estimating of the strength of these predictive models. We developed predictive models by applying machine learning methods (i.e., elastic net and lasso regression models) to YARH's self-reports of internet use. The YARH were aged 14-24 years old (N = 1287) from Los Angeles and New Orleans. Models were fit to three binary indicators of YARH's lifetime internet searches for general health, sexual and reproductive health (SRH), and social service information. YARH responses regarding internet health information seeking were fed into machine learning models with potential predictor variables based on findings from previous research, including sociodemographic characteristics, sexual and gender minority identity, healthcare access and engagement, sexual behavior, substance use, and mental health. About half of the YARH reported seeking general health and SRH information and 26% sought social service information. Areas under the ROC curve (&#8805; .75) indicated strong predictive models and results were consistent with the existing literature. For example, higher education and sexual minority identification was associated with seeking general health, SRH, and social service information. New findings also emerged. Cisgender identity versus transgender and non-binary identities was associated with lower odds of general health, SRH, and social service information seeking. Experiencing intimate partner violence was associated with higher odds of seeking general health, SRH, and social service information. Findings demonstrate the ability to develop predictive models to inform targeted health information dissemination strategies but underscore the need to better understand health disparities that can be operationalized as predictors in machine learning algorithms.","Comulada, W Scott; Goldbeck, Cameron; Almirol, Ellen; Gunn, Heather J; Ocasio, Manuel A; Fernández, M Isabel; Arnold, Elizabeth Mayfield; Romero-Espinoza, Adriana; Urauchi, Stacey; Ramos, Wilson; Rotheram-Borus, Mary Jane; Klausner, Jeffrey D; Swendeman, Dallas",Prev. sci,,12

291845,A Selective Sulfide Oxidation catalyzed by Heterogeneous Artificial Enzymes Iron@NikA,2020,"Uncontrolled diabetes results in several metabolic alterations including hyperglycemia. Indeed, several preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that this condition may induce susceptibility and the development of more aggressive infectious diseases, especially those caused by some bacteria (including Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, among others) and viruses [such as coronavirus 2 (CoV2), Influenza A virus, Hepatitis B, etc.]. Although the precise mechanisms that link glycemia to the exacerbated infections remain elusive, hyperglycemia is known to induce a wide array of changes in the immune system activity, including alterations in: (i) the microenvironment of immune cells (e.g., pH, blood viscosity and other biochemical parameters); (ii) the supply of energy to infectious bacteria; (iii) the inflammatory response; and (iv) oxidative stress as a result of bacterial proliferative metabolism. Consistent with this evidence, some bacterial infections are typical (and/or have a worse prognosis) in patients with hypercaloric diets and a stressful lifestyle (conditions that promote hyperglycemic episodes). On this basis, the present review is particularly focused on: (i) the role of diabetes in the development of some bacterial and viral infections by analyzing preclinical and clinical findings; (ii) discussing the possible mechanisms by which hyperglycemia may increase the susceptibility for developing infections; and (iii) further understanding the impact of hyperglycemia on the immune system.","Chávez-Reyes, Jesús; Escárcega-González, Carlos E; Chavira-Suárez, Erika; León-Buitimea, Angel; Vázquez-León, Priscila; Morones-Ramírez, José R; Villalón, Carlos M; Quintanar-Stephano, Andrés; Marichal-Cancino, Bruno A",Front Public Health,,12

Homemade remedies7,8 and falsehoods are being shared widely on the Internet, as well as dismissals of expert advice9-11. There is a lack of understanding about how this distrust evolves at the system level13,14.

Its core reveals a multi-sided landscape of unprecedented intricacy that involves nearly 100 million individuals partitioned into highly dynamic, interconnected clusters across cities, countries, continents and languages. Although smaller in overall size, anti-vaccination clusters manage to become highly entangled with undecided clusters in the main online network, whereas pro-vaccination clusters are more peripheral. Our theoretical framework reproduces the recent explosive growth in anti-vaccination views, and predicts that these views will dominate in a decade. Insights provided by this framework can inform new policies and approaches to interrupt this shift to negative views. Our results challenge the conventional thinking about undecided individuals in issues of contention surrounding health, shed light on other issues of contention such as climate change11, and highlight the key role of network cluster dynamics in multi-species ecologies15.","Johnson, Neil F; Velásquez, Nicolas; Restrepo, Nicholas Johnson; Leahy, Rhys; Gabriel, Nicholas; El Oud, Sara; Zheng, Minzhang; Manrique, Pedro; Wuchty, Stefan; Lupu, Yonatan",Nature,,12

Our purpose was to more precisely evaluate these impacts on radiologists through a nationwide survey. METHODS: A 43-item anonymous questionnaire was adapted from the AO Spine Foundation's survey and distributed to 1521 unique email addresses using REDCap&#8482; (Research Electronic Data Capture). Additional invitations were sent out to American Society of Emergency Radiology (ASER) and Association of University Radiologists (AUR) members. Responses were collected over a period of 8 days. Descriptive analyses and multivariate modeling were performed using SAS v9.4 software. RESULTS: A total of 689 responses from radiologists across 44 different states met the criteria for inclusion in the analysis. As many as 61% of respondents rated their level of anxiety with regard to COVID-19 to be a 7 out of 10 or greater, and higher scores were positively correlated the standardized number of COVID-19 cases in a respondent's state (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02-1.21, p = 0.01). Citing the stressor of ""personal health"" was a strong predictor of higher anxiety scores (RR 1.23; 95% CI: 1.13-1.34, p < 0.01). By contrast, participants who reported needing no coping methods were more likely to self-report lower anxiety scores (RR 0.4; 95% CI: 0.3-0.53, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had a significant impact on radiologists across the nation. As these unique stressors continue to evolve, further attention must be paid to the ways in which we may continue to support radiologists working in drastically altered practice environments and in remote settings.","Demirjian, Natalie L; Fields, Brandon K K; Song, Catherine; Reddy, Sravanthi; Desai, Bhushan; Cen, Steven Y; Salehi, Sana; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",Clin Imaging,,12

COVID-19 infection leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome in a subset of patients and is a primary driver of acute morbidity in infected persons. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that SARS-CoV-2 infection drives dysfunction and pathology outside the lungs, including reports of renal, cardiac, and neurological complications. In this study, we summarize the known incidence and evidence of neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and other pathogenic coronaviruses. These studies describe a poorly understood spectrum of COVID-19 central nervous system symptoms, ranging from common and subclinical issues such as anosmia and headache to more concerning reports of stroke and encephalopathy. We discuss potential mechanisms of pathogenesis, including a discussion of how the understanding of neurological complications known to occur in HIV-1 patients may provide insight into SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological manifestations. Specifically, three hypotheses are discussed that are informed by decades of knowledge about HIV pathogenesis in the brain, which include a potential direct viral effect, an indirect viral effect, and/or a neuroimmune axis effect. Individually or in combination these potential effects may contribute to COVID-19 neurological complications.","Al-Harthi, Lena; Campbell, Edward; Schneider, Julie A; Bennett, David A",AIDS res. hum. retroviruses,,12

301509,A rotationally focused flow (RFF) microfluidic biosensor by density difference for early-stage detectable diagnosis,2021,"In order to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), till now no such specific treatment is available. Various coronaviruses (CoV) such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), SARS-CoV-2 can infect human and the name was implicated due to their crown shape. SARS-CoV-2 is also called COVID-19 which was found to be a novel strain of coronavirus and is transmitted primarily through small droplets of viral particles that targets human body through the open pathways. Researchers have observed that microbes can survive for a longer duration they get adhered to any object or surface. Nanoparticles have giant capability to disable these pathogens even before they enter the body. To eradicate conventional time consuming steps like quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction for detection of COVID-19, nanoparticles mediated sensing approaches is providing a great advances in rapid diagnosis. Nano particles based biosensors are comparatively beneficial which offer tremendous potential for rapid medical diagnosis. Nanotechnology can be refined and optimized to attack a wide variety of pathogens. As compared to other large molecular structures, nanoparticles being small in size have huge sensitivity for bio-sensing and can move throughout the body without providing any disruption in the immune functioning.","Chauhan, Pallavi Singh; Yadav, Dhananjay; Dubey, Anuj; Jin, Jun-O",Curr. pharm. des,,12
303364,COVID-19 and hypertension: Is there a role for dsRNA and activation of Toll-like receptor 3?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has become an integral part of modern intensive therapy. The choice of support mode depends largely on the indication. Patients with respiratory failure are predominantly treated with a venovenous (VV) approach. We hypothesized that mortality in Germany in ECLS therapy did not differ from previously reported literature METHODS: Inpatient data from Germany from 2007 to 2018 provided by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany were analysed. The international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems codes (ICD) and process keys (OPS) for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) types, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hospital mortality were used. RESULTS: In total, 45,647 hospitalized patients treated with ECLS were analysed. In Germany, 231 hospitals provided ECLS therapy, with a median of 4 VV-ECMO and 9 VA-ECMO in 2018. Overall hospital mortality remained higher than predicted in comparison to the values reported in the literature. The number of VV-ECMO cases increased by 236% from 825 in 2007 to 2768 in 2018. ARDS was the main indication for VV-ECMO in only 33% of the patients in the past, but that proportion increased to 60% in 2018. VA-ECMO support is of minor importance in the treatment of ARDS in Germany. The age distribution of patients undergoing ECLS has shifted towards an older population. In 2018, the hospital mortality decreased in VV-ECMO patients and VV-ECMO patients with ARDS to 53.9% (n = 1493) and 54.4% (n = 926), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ARDS is a severe disease with a high mortality rate despite ECLS therapy. Although endpoints and timing of the evaluations differed from those of the CESAR and EOLIA studies and the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry, the reported mortality in these studies was lower than in the present analysis. Further prospective analyses are necessary to evaluate outcomes in ECMO therapy at the centre volume level.","Friedrichson, Benjamin; Mutlak, Haitham; Zacharowski, Kai; Piekarski, Florian",Crit Care,,12
303682,Chemical Probes for Blocking of Influenza A M2 Wild-type and S31N Channels,2020,"BACKGROUND: Prurigo nodularis (PN) is associated with a variety of systemic comorbidities, including infectious diseases such as HIV and viral hepatitis. There are limited data on other infectious disease comorbidities in patients with PN. OBJECTIVE: To characterize infectious disease hospitalizations among patients with PN and the associated cost burden. METHODS: We searched the 2016-2017 National Inpatient Sample, a cross-sectional sample of 20% of all U.S. hospitalizations, for infectious disease hospitalizations among patients with PN. Associations of PN with infections and related costs were determined using multivariable logistic and linear regression adjusting for age, race, sex, and insurance type. RESULTS: PN was associated with any infection overall (OR 2.98, 95% CI: 2.49 - 3.56), as well as sepsis, HIV, cutaneous, hepatobiliary, CNS, bacterial, viral, and fungal/parasitic infections. PN patients had a higher mean cost of care ($11,667 vs. $8,893, P<0.001) and length of stay (5.5 days vs. 4.2 days, P<0.001) for any infection overall and 7 of 13 other infections. Adjusting for age, race, sex, and insurance coverage, PN was associated with higher cost (+30%, 95% CI: +17% - +44%) and higher length of stay (+30%, 95% CI: +18% - +44%) for any infection overall, as well as several other infections. These associations remained with alternate regression models adjusting for severity of illness. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high infectious disease burden among PN patients, corresponding to higher healthcare utilization and spending. Clinicians must be aware of these associations when treating PN patients with immunomodulatory drugs.","Sutaria, N; Choi, J; Roh, Y S; Alphonse, M P; Adawi, W; Lai, J; Pollock, J R; Fontecilla Biles, N; Gabriel, S; Chavda, R; Kwatra, S G",Clin. exp. dermatol,,12

305534,Therapeutic Potential of Glycosyl Flavonoids as Anti-Coronaviral Agents,2021,"The current outbreak of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus, 2019_nCoV (now named SARS-CoV-2), illustrated difficulties in identifying a novel coronavirus and its natural host, as the coding sequences of various Betacoronavirus species can be highly diverse. By means of whole-genome sequence comparisons, we demonstrate that the noncoding flanks of the viral genome can be used to correctly separate the recognized four betacoronavirus subspecies. The conservation would be sufficient to define target sequences that could, in theory, classify novel virus species into their subspecies. Only 253 upstream noncoding sequences of Sarbecovirus are sufficient to identify genetic similarities between species of this subgenus. Furthermore, it was investigated which bat species have commercial value in China, and would thus likely be handled for trading purposes. A number of coronavirus genomes have been published that were obtained from such bat species. These bats are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and their handling poses a potential risk to cause zoonotic coronavirus epidemics. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The noncoding upstream and downstream flanks of coronavirus genomes allow for rapid classification of novel Betacoronavirus species and correct identification of genetic relationships. Although bats are the likely natural host of 2019_nCoV, the exact bat species that serves as the natural host of the virus remains as yet unknown. Chinese bat species with commercial value were identified as natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Since their trading provides a potential risk for spreading zoonoses, a change in these practices is highly recommended.","Wassenaar, T M; Zou, Y",Lett Appl Microbiol,,12

Successive monitoring of these pollutants has noteworthy significance for drinking water safety. Accordingly, this study conducted successive monitoring of antibiotics and ARGs from 2015 to 2017 in a drinking water source in East China. The total antibiotic concentration ranged from 19.68 ng/L to 497.00 ng/L, and decreased slightly from 2015 to 2017. Eighteen out of forty-one ARG subtypes showing resistance to six antibiotic classes and one class I integrase gene intI1, were detected in the drinking water source at concentrations ranging from 6.5 × 104 copies/mL to 1.6 × 106 copies/mL. Importantly, the total ARG concentration increased on an annual basis from 2015 to 2017 with an average annual increment of 0.25 orders of magnitude, which was mainly attributed to the increase in specific ARG subtypes, such as sul1, sul2, sul3, tetA, qnrB, and ermB. Most ARGs was positively correlated with the intI1 genes (r = 0.47-0.55, P < 0.01). Furthermore, the variation of antibiotics and ARGs appeared to be related to the water indices, particularly of the values of COD, BOD5, NO2-N (P < 0.05). This study provides basic data on antibiotic and ARG pollution in the studied drinking water source. Importantly, the findings expound that although the residual antibiotics in this drinking water source decreased slightly from 2015 to 2017, while its biological effect, the antibiotic resistance, increased annually, which give a warning of the antibiotic resistance pollution in the drinking water source.","Hu, Yaru; Jin, Lei; Zhao, Yi; Jiang, Lei; Yao, Shijie; Zhou, Wang; Lin, Kuangfei; Cui, Changzheng",Sci Total Environ,,12

Over the counter antipyretics such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen are often taken by individuals to reduce the discomfort of fever. Recently, the safety of ibuprofen in COVID-19 patients has been questioned due to anecdotal reports of worsening symptoms in previously healthy young adults. Studies show that ibuprofen demonstrates superior efficacy in fever reduction compared to acetaminophen. As fever may have benefit in shortening the duration of viral illness, it is plausible to hypothesize that the antipyretic efficacy of ibuprofen may be hindering the benefits of a fever response when taken during the early stages of COVID-19 illness.","Jamerson, Brenda D; Haryadi, T Ho",Med Hypotheses,,12

The technique is highly relevant in imaging the dynamic gut environment where different cell types interact during homeostasis and disease states. This method optimized for the mouse gut is described here, which helps to trace cell types like epithelia, enteroendocrine, neurons, glia, and the neuronal projections into the epithelia or enteroendocrine cells that mediate microbial sensing or nutrient chemo sensing respectively. The gut tissue (1-1.5 cm) is fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C overnight on day 1. On day 2, PFA is discarded, and the tissue is washed thrice with PBS. The tissue is hydrogel embedded to preserve its integrity by incubation in 4% hydrogel (acrylamide) solution in PBS (diluted from 30% ProtoGel) overnight at 4 °C. On day 3, the tissue-hydrogel solution is incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to allow hydrogel polymerization. Tissue is then washed thrice gently with PBS to remove excess hydrogel. The subsequent step of delipidation (clearing) involves tissue incubation in sodium dodecyl sulfate (8% SDS in PBS) at 37 °C for 2 days (days 4 & 5) on a shaker at room temperature (RT). On day 6, the cleared tissue is thoroughly washed with PBS to remove SDS. Tissue can be immunostained by incubation in primary antibodies (diluted in 0.5% normal donkey serum in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100), overnight at 4°C, and subsequent incubation in appropriate secondary Alexa Fluor antibodies for 1.5 h at RT, and nuclear staining with DAPI (1: 10000).

AIM: This present study was conducted to identify the potential target and molecular mechanism of the major compound on Alpinia galanga extract and Citrus sinensis (L.) extract in circumventing COVID-19 using a bioinformatics approach and in silico molecular docking. RESULTS: Direct protein target of all secondary metabolite and the gene list from PubMed “Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” generated 2 genes (CCL2 and VEGFA) as potential therapeutics target genes (PTTG). The molecular docking was conducted by the Protein-Ligand Ant System (PLANTS) software. The results show that hesperidin, naringenin, and galangin have lower docking score for all five-protein target receptor compared with chloroquine and remdesivir. The lower docking score suggests a high affinity to bind the protein. Moreover, these compounds have a strong affinity in their inhibitory capacity for viral infection.

Preeclampsia and HCQ-related side effects were not detected in the groups. There were also no significant differences between the groups in terms of FGR, gestational day at birth, birthweight and the presence of ""APGAR score <7"" at 10th minute (P = 0.462, P = 0.064, P = 0.273 and P = 0.627, respectively). CONCLUSION: Low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin, low-dose salicylic acid and low-dose corticosteroid prophylaxis together with HCQ seem to be promising in pregnancies with immune system disorders. HCQ seems to be a safe and effective drug in low dosages.","Beksac, Mehmet Sinan; Donmez, Hanife Guler",J Obstet Gynaecol Res,,12

METHODS: We included all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had completed hospitalization between March 10, 2020 and April 10, 2020 with follow-up through April 20, 2020. Patients who received TCB in addition to standard of care within 48 h of admission were matched in a 1:2 fashion to a similar cohort who received standard of care alone. Clinical outcomes were compared between matched groups. The primary outcome was de-escalation in oxygen therapy. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital death, septic shock, and acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring hemodialysis. RESULTS: Out of 77 patients who received TCB in addition to standard of care, 34% (n = 26) received TCB within 48 h of admission. One-to-two propensity matching identified 20 versus 40 patients in the TCB and no-TCB treatment arms. In the TCB group, an improvement in oxygenation was observed in 80% (n = 16) of the patients by 7 days post TCB administration. After matching, there was no difference in clinical outcomes between TCB and no-TCB patients. In-hospital death: 10% versus 8%; p = .823, septic shock: 10% versus 11%, p = .912, AKI requiring hemodialysis (10% vs. 13%; p = .734). CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment with TCB in patients admitted for COVID-19 led to an improvement in their oxygen status during hospitalization. This change however did not translate into improved survival when compared to a matched cohort with a similar clinical profile.","Okoh, Alexis K; Bishburg, Eliahu; Grinberg, Sagy; Nagarakanti, Sandhya",J Med Virol,,12

320476,Synthetic Biology-derived triterpenes as efficacious immunomodulating adjuvants,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has created challenges for provider teams working in intensive care units, including rapidly changing patient care regulations, staffing considerations, and preservation of personal protective equipment. The need for enhanced respiratory precautions for infected patients and patients under investigation has necessitated a new process for interventions and resuscitation. LOCAL PROBLEM: Along with changing regulations and equipment, significant staff anxiety surrounded caring for infected patients and preparing for emergency situations. METHODS: A huddle process was implemented in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit for acutely ill patients who required enhanced respiratory precautions and were at risk of imminent decompensation, or who required a bedside procedure. During a huddle, the multidisciplinary team used process maps displayed in patient rooms; the huddle process created a situational awareness of events among these teams. INTERVENTION: After implementation of huddles, a survey was distributed to cardiac intensive care unit staff in order to understand their satisfaction with the huddle process. RESULTS: A total of 36 staff responded to the survey. They thought the huddles helped them to prepare for resuscitation scenarios, helped limit the number of personnel responding to an emergency, and reduced their anxiety surrounding caring for these patients. Staff suggested generalizing this huddle process to all patients at acute risk for decompensation in the cardiac intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: A novel huddle process created situational awareness among staff caring for patients requiring enhanced respiratory isolation because of COVID-19. Multidisciplinary huddles allowed staff from various disciplines to apply a process map for interventions and resuscitations among critically ill children with heart disease.","Christensen, Kristen; Colman, Nora; Van Voorhis, Kay; Daniels, Katherine; Culpepper, Haley; Hebbar, Kiran; Wolf, Michael",Crit Care Nurse,,12
321767,Edem1 activity in the fat body regulates insulin signalling and metabolic homeostasis in Drosophila,2021,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) ssp. indica is the most cultivated species in the South of Brazil. However, these plants face low temperature stress from September to November, which is the period of early sowing, affecting plant development during the initial stages of growth, and reducing rice productivity. This study aimed to characterize the root response to low temperature stress during the early vegetative stage of two rice genotypes contrasting in their cold tolerance (CT, cold-tolerant; and CS, cold-sensitive). Root dry weight and length, as well as the number of root hairs, were higher in CT than CS when exposed to cold treatment. Histochemical analyses indicated that roots of CS genotype present higher levels of lipid peroxidation and H2O2 accumulation, along with lower levels of plasma membrane integrity than CT under low temperature stress. RNAseq analyses revealed that the contrasting genotypes present completely different molecular responses to cold stress. The number of over-represented functional categories was lower in CT than CS under cold condition, suggesting that CS genotype is more impacted by low temperature stress than CT. Several genes might contribute to rice cold tolerance, including the ones related with cell wall remodeling, cytoskeleton and growth, signaling, antioxidant system, lipid metabolism, and stress response. On the other hand, high expression of the genes SRC2 (defense), root architecture associated 1 (growth), ACC oxidase, ethylene-responsive transcription factor, and cytokinin-O-glucosyltransferase 2 (hormone-related) seems to be related with cold sensibility. Since these two genotypes have a similar genetic background (sister lines), the differentially expressed genes found here can be considered candidate genes for cold tolerance and could be used in future biotechnological approaches aiming to increase rice tolerance to low temperature.","Rativa, Angie Geraldine Sierra; Junior, Artur Teixeira de Araújo; Friedrich, Daniele da Silva; Gastmann, Rodrigo; Lamb, Thainá Inês; Silva, Alexsander Dos Santos; Adamski, Janete Mariza; Fett, Janette Palma; Ricachenevsky, Felipe Klein; Sperotto, Raul Antonio",J Plant Physiol,,12

METHODS: In the world of pediatric oncology, we have found ourselves up against new challenges. In this article, we discuss the difficulties found in conducting psychological support sessions while complying with physical distancing rules, as well as wearing protective face masks, and even gloves; or while using modern remote communication telecommunications. RESULTS: The classic reasons behind requests for psychological support have been compounded by other, novel problems, such as: fewer relational resources for families at home, less chance to socialize, hospital stays with only one parent, the suspension of all teaching and group activities on the ward, economic difficulties caused by the pandemic, the rising levels of family conflictuality and generalized anxiety.

323608,Coronavirus infections in childhood and vaccine studies,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, is highly infectious and its ongoing outbreak has been declared a global pandemic by the WHO. Pregnant women are susceptible to respiratory pathogens and the development of severe pneumonia, suggesting the urgent need to assess the potential maternal and infant outcome of pregnancy with COVID-19. The intrauterine vertical transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 also remains controversial. Herein, we discuss the potential effect of COVID-19 on maternal and infant outcomes based on current studies, including those published in Chinese, in a total of 80 mothers with COVID-19 and 80 infants. We also comprehensively explored the mother-to-child transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2, in particular the route of intrauterine vertical transmission. Given SARS-CoV-2 is a sister to SARS-CoV, of the SARS-related coronavirus species, we made a comprehensive comparison between them to learn from experiences with SARS. Although there is no evidence supporting the intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, our comprehensive analysis suggests that the adverse maternal and infant outcomes caused by COVID-19 cannot be underestimated. Further, we speculated that the inconsistency between nucleic acids and serological characteristics IgM to SARS-CoV-2 of infants' specimens may be caused by the disruption of the amniotic barrier by the inflammatory factors induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our review is beneficial to understand the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on maternal and infant outcomes.","Wang, Yun; Wang, Yiliang; Han, Xiaoxue; Ye, Jiazhuo; Li, Ruiman",Front. Pediatr.,,12

Although there is an extensive, growing body of PsyCap academic research in all levels of analysis and domains, there is still a void in PsyCap's applications within psychiatry. The purpose of this article is to review PsyCap applications and its implications for the practice of psychiatry, especially within the context of 4IR and the second wave of Positive Psychology (PP 2.0).

During this crisis, it was demonstrated that a better understanding of the pathogenicity, virulence, and contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2, all of which were initially underestimated, was urgently needed. The development of diagnostic tests to identify SARS-CoV-2 or to detect anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies in blood, of vaccines, and of preventive and curative treatments has been relying on intense activity of scientists in academia and industry. It is noteworthy that these scientists depend on the use of high-quality biological samples taken from positive COVID-19 patients in a manner that preserves their integrity. Given this unique and emergent situation, it was necessary to urgently establish biological collections clinically annotated for immediate development of clinical and translational research projects focusing on COVID-19 biological aspects. It is in this very specific context that biobanks must rapidly adapt their infrastructure and/or operational capacity to fulfill new critical needs.

329799,Sex differences in immune responses in COVID-19,2020,"COVID-19 has had a calamitous effect on the global community. Despite intense study, the immunologic response to the infection is only partially understood. In addition to older age and ethnicity, patients with comorbidities including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, malignancy, renal, and pulmonary disease may experience severe outcomes. Some patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) and secondary immunodeficiency also appear to be at increased risk from COVID-19. In addition to vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2, patients with PIDs often have chronic pulmonary disease and may not respond to vaccines, which exacerbates their long-term risk. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders, the most frequent symptomatic PID in adults and children, have a spectrum of B- and T-cell defects. It may be possible to stratify their risk for severe COVID-19 based on age, ethnicity, the severity of the T-cell defect, and the presence of other comorbidities. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders and other immunodeficiencies are at risk for Chronic COVID-19, a dangerous stalemate between a suboptimal immune response and SARS-CoV-2. Intra-host viral evolution could result in the rapid emergence of vaccine-resistant mutants and variants of high consequence; it is a public health emergency. Vaccination and prevention of Chronic COVID-19 in immunodeficient patients is therefore of the utmost priority. Having a reliable diagnostic assay for T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for evaluating responses to vaccines in these patients. New treatments for SARS-CoV-2 such as NZACE2-Patari are likely to be particularly beneficial for immunodeficient patients, especially those who fail to mount a robust T-cell response to COVID-19 vaccines.","Ameratunga, Rohan; Longhurst, Hilary; Steele, Richard; Lehnert, Klaus; Leung, Euphemia; Brooks, Anna E S; Woon, See-Tarn",J.

Among frontline healthcare workers, physician trainees represent a unique group-functioning simultaneously as both learners and caregivers and experiencing considerable challenges during the pandemic. However, we have a limited understanding regarding the emotional effects and vulnerability experienced by trainees during the pandemic. We investigated the effects of trainee exposure to patients being tested for COVID-19 on their depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment. All physician trainees at an academic medical center (n = 1375) were invited to participate in an online survey. We compared the measures of depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment among trainees who were exposed to patients being tested for COVID-19 and those that were not, using univariable and multivariable models. We also evaluated perceived life stressors such as childcare, home schooling, personal finances and work-family balance among both groups. 393 trainees completed the survey (29% response rate). Compared to the non-exposed group, the exposed group had a higher prevalence of stress (29.4% vs. 18.9%), and burnout (46.3% vs. 33.7%). The exposed group also experienced moderate to extremely high perceived stress regarding childcare and had a lower work-family balance. Multivariable models indicated that trainees who were exposed to COVID-19 patients reported significantly higher stress (10.96 [95% CI, 9.65 to 12.46] vs 8.44 [95% CI, 7.3 to 9.76]; P = 0.043) and were more likely to be burned out (1.31 [95% CI, 1.21 to1.41] vs 1.07 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.19]; P = 0.002]. We also found that female trainees were more likely to be stressed (P = 0.043); while unmarried trainees were more likely to be depressed (P = 0.009), and marginally more likely to have anxiety (P = 0.051). To address these challenges, wellness programs should focus on sustaining current programs, develop new and targeted mental health resources that are widely accessible and devise strategies for creating awareness regarding these resources.","Kannampallil, Thomas G; Goss, Charles W; Evanoff, Bradley A; Strickland, Jaime R; McAlister, Rebecca P; Duncan, Jennifer",PLoS One,,12

A major result indicates an existing infections estimate at about 10-50 times the daily confirmed new cases, with the stringent social distancing policy tipping to the upper end of this range. It clarifies the relationship between the infection rate and the test rate to put the epidemic under control, which says that the test rate shall keep up at the same pace as infection rate to prevent an outbreak. This relationship is meaningful in the wake of business re-opening in the U.S. and the world. The report also reveals the connections of all the measures taken to the epidemic spread. A stratified sampling method is proposed to add to the current tool kits of epidemic control. Again, this report is a summary of some straight observations and thoughts, not through a thorough study backed with field data. The results appear obvious and suitable for general education to interested policymakers and the public.","Wang, Xiubin Bruce; Ma, Chaolun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09769v1.pdf,12

METHODS: Fifty-one patients were diagnosed with CRKP bloodstream infection between January 2015 and December 2020, among which 42 isolates were available for further study. Species identification and antibiotic susceptibilities were tested with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and VITEK 2 systems. Carbapenemase genes, virulence genes and MLST genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, the string test and serum killing assay were performed to evaluate the virulence of the CRKP isolates. RESULTS: During the six-year period, the detection rate of CRKP in bloodstream infection showed an increasing trend, with the intensive care unit, hematology and respiratory medicine wards mainly affected. Molecular epidemiology analyses showed that KPC-2 was the dominant carbapenemase gene. In addition, the dominant sequence type (ST) of CRKP shifted from ST11 to ST15 strains, which were all sensitive to amikacin in contrast to the ST11 stains. Furthermore, ST15 CRKP strains were positive for the KfuB virulence gene and more resistant to serum killing compared to the ST11 CRKP strains. Nonetheless, the mortality rate of patients infected with ST11 and ST15 CRKP did not show any significant differences. CONCLUSION: A shift in the dominant sequence type of CRKP bloodstream infections from ST11 to ST15 was observed during the years 2015-2020. Compared to ST11, the ST15 CRKP strains showed amikacin sensitivity, positivity for KfuB gene, and serum resistance, which may indicate stronger virulence.","Chen, J.; Hu, C.; Wang, R.; Li, F.; Sun, G.; Yang, M.; Chu, Y.",Infect Drug Resist,,12
336015,Stochastic Modeling of an Infectious Disease Part II: Simulation Experiments and Verification of the Analysis,2021-01-26,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that first emerged in late 2019 is responsible for a pandemic of severe respiratory illness. People infected with this highly contagious virus can present with clinically inapparent, mild, or severe disease. Currently, the virus infection in individuals and at the population level is being monitored by PCR testing of symptomatic patients for the presence of viral RNA. There is an urgent need for SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests to identify all infected individuals, irrespective of clinical symptoms, to conduct surveillance and implement strategies to contain spread. As the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is poorly conserved between SARS-CoVs and other pathogenic human coronaviruses, the RBD represents a promising antigen for detecting CoV-specific antibodies in people. Here we use a large panel of human sera (63 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 71 control subjects) and hyperimmune sera from animals exposed to zoonotic CoVs to evaluate RBD's performance as an antigen for reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. By day 9 after the onset of symptoms, the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen was highly sensitive (98%) and specific (100%) for antibodies induced by SARS-CoVs. We observed a strong correlation between levels of RBD binding antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in patients. Our results, which reveal the early kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, support using the RBD antigen in serological diagnostic assays and RBD-specific antibody levels as a correlate of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in people.","Premkumar, Lakshmanane; Segovia-Chumbez, Bruno; Jadi, Ramesh; Martinez, David R; Raut, Rajendra; Markmann, Alena; Cornaby, Caleb; Bartelt, Luther; Weiss, Susan; Park, Yara; Edwards, Caitlin E; Weimer, Eric; Scherer, Erin M; Rouphael, Nadine; Edupuganti, Srilatha; Weiskopf, Daniela; Tse, Longping V; Hou, Yixuan J; Margolis, David; Sette, Alessandro; Collins, Matthew H; Schmitz, John; Baric, Ralph S; de Silva, Aravinda M",Sci. immunol,,12

Three major structural proteins, the spike, envelope and membrane proteins, are amongst several SARS-CoV-2 components synthesised at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of infected human cells prior to the assembly of new viral particles. Hence, the inhibition of membrane protein synthesis at the ER is an attractive strategy for reducing the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and other obligate viral pathogens. Using an in vitro system, we demonstrate that the small molecule inhibitor ipomoeassin F (Ipom-F) potently blocks the Sec61-mediated ER membrane translocation/insertion of three therapeutic protein targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection; the viral spike and ORF8 proteins together with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the host cell plasma membrane receptor. Our findings highlight the potential for using ER protein translocation inhibitors such as Ipom-F as host-targeting, broad-spectrum, antiviral agents.","O039,; Keefe, Sarah; Roboti, Peristera; Duah, Kwabena B; Zong, Guanghui; Schneider, Hayden; Shi, Wei Q; High, Stephen",,,12

Design and methods: This single-center study was retrospective and consisted in evaluating thyroid function tests and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) values in 287 consecutive patients (193 males, median age: 66 years, range: 27-92) hospitalized for COVID-19 in non-intensive care units. Results: Fifty-eight patients (20.2%) were found with thyrotoxicosis (overt in 31 cases), 15 (5.2%) with hypothyroidism (overt in only 2 cases), and 214 (74.6%) with normal thyroid function. Serum thyrotropin (TSH) values were inversely correlated with age of patients (rho -0.27; P < 0.001) and IL-6 (rho -0.41; P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, thyrotoxicosis resulted to be significantly associated with higher IL-6 (odds ratio: 3.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.97-5.36; P < 0.001), whereas the association with age of patients was lost (P = 0.09). Conclusions: This study provides first evidence that COVID-19 may be associated with high risk of thyrotoxicosis in relationship with systemic immune activation induced by the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lania, Andrea; Sandri, Maria Teresa; Cellini, Miriam; Mirani, Marco; Lavezzi, Elisabetta; Mazziotti, Gherardo",Eur J Endocrinol,,12

METHODS: A prospective, observational, non-randomized cohort trial was performed comparing 25 consecutive patients who underwent PUG placement between April 2020 and August 2020 with 25 consecutive patients who underwent PRG placement between February 2020 and March 2020. Procedure time, sedation, analgesia requirements, and complications were compared between the two groups in non-inferiority analysis. RESULTS: Technical success rates were 96% in both groups (24/25) of procedures. Ninety-two percent of patients in the PUG cohort were admitted to the ICU at the time of G-tube request. Aside from significantly more COVID-19 patients in the PUG group (P < .001), there was no other statistically significant difference in patient demographics. Intra-procedure pain medication requirements were the same for both groups, 50 micrograms of IV fentanyl (P = 1.0). Intra-procedure sedation with IV midazolam was insignificantly higher in the PUG group 1.12 mg vs 0.8 mg (P = .355). Procedure time trended toward statistical significance (P = .076), with PRG being shorter than PUG (30.5 ± 14.1 minutes vs 39.7 ± 17.9 minutes). There were 2 non-device related major complications in the PUG group and 1 major and 1 minor complication in the PRG group. CONCLUSION: PUG is similar in terms of complications to PRG gastrostomy tube placement and a safe method for gastrostomy tube placement in the critically ill with the added benefits of bedside placement, elimination of radiation exposure, and expanded and improved access to care.","Reis, Stephen P; Brejt, Sidney Z; Weintraub, Joseph R; Ahmad, Noor; Susman, Jonathan; Mobley, David G",J Intensive Care Med,,12

347947,Compendium solar spectrum formation,2021-03-03,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, manifests as a respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) and is the cause of an ongoing pandemic. The response to COVID-19 in the United States has been hampered by an overall lack of diagnostic testing capacity. To address uncertainty about ongoing levels of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission early in the pandemic, we aimed to develop a surveillance tool using readily available emergency department (ED) operations data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR). This involved optimizing the identification of acute respiratory infection (ARI)-related encounters and then comparing metrics for these encounters before and after the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. METHODS: We performed an observational study using operational EHR data from two Midwest EDs with a combined annual census of over 80,000. Data were collected three weeks before and after the first confirmed case of local SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. To optimize capture of ARI cases, we compared various metrics including chief complaint, discharge diagnoses, and ARI-related orders. Operational metrics for ARI cases, including volume, pathogen identification, and illness severity, were compared between the preand post-community transmission timeframes using chi-square tests of independence. RESULTS: Compared to our combined definition of ARI, chief complaint, discharge diagnoses, and isolation orders individually identified less than half of the cases. Respiratory pathogen testing was the top performing individual ARI definition but still only identified 72.2% of cases. From the pre to post periods, we observed significant increases in ED volumes due to ARI and ARI cases without identified pathogen. CONCLUSION: Certain methods for identifying ARI cases in the ED may be inadequate and multiple criteria should be used to optimize capture. In the absence of widely available SARS-CoV-2 testing, operational metrics for ARI-related encounters, especially the proportion of cases involving negative pathogen testing, are useful indicators for active surveillance of potential COVID-19 related ED visits.","Pulia, Michael S; Hekman, Daniel J; Glazer, Joshua M; Barclay-Buchanan, Ciara; Kuehnel, Nicholas; Ross, Joshua; Sharp, Brian; Batt, Robert; Patterson, Brian W",West J Emerg Med,,12

The proposed method uses a developed breath device composed of a nanomaterial-based hybrid sensor array with multiplexed detection capabilities that can detect disease-specific biomarkers from exhaled breath, thus enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis. An exploratory clinical study with this approach was examined in Wuhan, China, during March 2020. The study cohort included 49 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 58 healthy controls, and 33 non-COVID lung infection controls. When applicable, positive COVID-19 patients were sampled twice: during the active disease and after recovery. Discriminant analysis of the obtained signals from the nanomaterial-based sensors achieved very good test discriminations between the different groups. The training and test set data exhibited respectively 94% and 76% accuracy in differentiating patients from controls as well as 90% and 95% accuracy in differentiating between patients with COVID-19 and patients with other lung infections. While further validation studies are needed, the results may serve as a base for technology that would lead to a reduction in the number of unneeded confirmatory tests and lower the burden on hospitals, while allowing individuals a screening solution that can be performed in PoC facilities. The proposed method can be considered as a platform that could be applied for any other disease infection with proper modifications to the artificial intelligence and would therefore be available to serve as a diagnostic tool in case of a new disease outbreak.","Shan, Benjie; Broza, Yoav Y; Li, Wenjuan; Wang, Yong; Wu, Sihan; Liu, Zhengzheng; Wang, Jiong; Gui, Shuyu; Wang, Lin; Zhang, Zhihong; Liu, Wei; Zhou, Shoubing; Jin, Wei; Zhang, Qianyu; Hu, Dandan; Lin, Lin; Zhang, Qiujun; Li, Wenyu; Wang, Jinquan; Liu, Hu; Pan, Yueyin; Haick, Hossam",ACS nano,,12

357826,The interplay between immunosenescence and age-related diseases,2020,"PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: To evaluate recent studies related to the paradox of high HDL-C with mortality and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. RECENT FINDINGS: Two observational studies (Cardiovascular Health in Ambulatory Care Research Team [CANHEART] and Copenhagen City Heart Study and the Copenhagen General Population Study [Copenhagen Heart Studies]) of adults without pre-existing ASCVD have shown a significant U-shaped association of HDL-C with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Both studies showed that low HDL-C levels consistently increased hazard risk (HR) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality. In the CANHEART study, high HDL-C levels, HDL-C > 90 mg/dL, were associated with increased HR for non-CVD/non-cancer mortality. In the Copenhagen Heart Studies, women with HDL-C &#8805; 135 mg/dL showed increased HR for all-cause and CVD mortality, while men with HDL-C > 97 mg/dL showed increased HR for all-cause and CVD mortality. Genetic association studies failed to show that genetic etiologies of high HDL-C significantly reduced risk for myocardial infarction (MI), while hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF4A) was significantly associated with high HDL-C and increased MI risk. Candidate gene studies have identified scavenger receptor B class I (SCARB1) and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG3) as genes significantly associated with high HDL-C and increased MI risk. Low HDL-C remains as a significant factor for increased disease risk while high HDL-C levels are not associated with cardioprotection. Clinical CVD risk calculators need revision.","Rodriguez, Annabelle",Curr Atheroscler Rep,,12
357827,The interplay between immunosenescence and age-related diseases,2020,"Epidemiological studies based on statistical methods indicate inverse correlations between virus lifetime and both (i) daily mean temperature and (ii) diurnal temperature range (DTR) While thermodynamic models have been used to predict the effect of constant-temperature surroundings on virus inactivation rate, the relationship between virus lifetime and DTR has not been explained using first principles Here, we model the inactivation of viruses based on temperature-dependent chemical kinetics with a time-varying temperature profile to account for the daily mean temperature and DTR simultaneously The exponential Arrhenius relationship governing the rate of virus inactivation causes fluctuations above the daily mean temperature during daytime to increase the instantaneous rate of inactivation by a much greater magnitude than the corresponding decrease in inactivation rate during nighttime This asymmetric behavior results in shorter predicted virus lifetimes when considering DTR and consequently reveals a potential physical mechanism for the inverse correlation with DTR reported in statistical epidemiological studies In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a case study on the effect of daily mean temperature and DTR on the lifetime of SARS-CoV-2 was performed for the five most populous cities in the United States In Los Angeles, where mean monthly temperature fluctuations are low (DTR ≈ 7 °C), accounting for DTR decreases predicted SARS-CoV-2 lifetimes by only 10%;conversely, accounting for DTR for a similar mean temperature but larger mean monthly temperature fluctuations in Phoenix (DTR ≈ 15 °C) decreases predicted lifetimes by 50% The modeling framework presented here provides insight into the independent effects of mean temperature and DTR on virus lifetime, and a significant impact on transmission rate is expected, especially for viruses that pose a high risk of fomite-mediated transmission","Yap, Te Faye Decker Colter J.; Preston, Daniel J.",Science of The Total Environment,,12

This decrease has been so high that, in most countries, the influenza and RSV epidemic has not occurred. Far from being a beneficial fact, this can be problematic, since the absence of circulation of certain pathogens can lead to a decrease in herd immunity against them. This can promote the rise of more serious, longer-lasting epidemics that start sooner. To alleviate the collateral effects that may occur due to the decrease in circulation of viruses such as influenza, it is necessary to increase the production of influenza vaccines, carry out mass vaccination campaigns and focus on vaccinating the main drivers of this virus, children.","Sanz-Muñoz, Ivan Tamames-Gómez Sonia Castrodeza-Sanz Javier Eiros-Bouza José María Raul Ortiz de Lejarazu-Leonardo",Vaccines,,12

METHOD: Randomized, controlled and blinded clinical trial to analyze parent-child interaction videos. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 18 children being followed up at the Autism Outpatient Clinic of a Neuropediatric Center in southern Brazil diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, between 29 and 42 months of age, randomly allocated to two groups: the Study Group (SG; nâ¯=â¯9), which received Parental Coaching performed by a professional certified by the ESDM (Early Start Denver Model); and the Control Group (CG; nâ¯=â¯9), which was in a routine follow-up, without treatment and training of parents by a trained professional. The parents of the SG were willing to attend weekly meetings and to apply the instructional techniques at home with their children. It took 12 weeks and an average of 2â¯h per meeting. CONCLUSIONS: The learning rate for comprehensive development skills in the ESDM checklist, such as receptive communication, expressive communication, social capacity, imitation, cognition, games, fine motor skills, gross motor skills, behavior, and personal independence was significantly higher in the SG, as well as the strategies and the quality of interaction between parents and children.

360197,Comparative Analysis and Design of a Solar-Based Parabolic Trough–ORC Cogeneration Plant for a Commercial Center,2020,"AIM: The presence of portal venous thrombosis (PVT) has previously been considered a contraindication to the insertion of transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunts (TIPSS). However, patients with PVT may be symptomatic with complications of portal hypertension, and may thus benefit from TIPSS to reduce portal venous pressure. There is increasing literature discussing the techniques and outcomes of TIPSS in PVT. This review summarises the techniques, indications and outcomes of TIPSS in PVT across published case reports, case series and comparative trials, especially regarding the reduction in portal hypertensive complications such as variceal bleeding. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using databases MEDLINE and PubMed. Manuscripts published in English between 1st January 1990 and 1st March 2021 were used. Abstracts were screened and data from potentially relevant articles analysed. RESULTS: TIPSS in PVT has been reported with high levels of technical success, short-term portal vein recanalisation and long-term PV patency and TIPSS patency outcomes. Several comparative studies, including randomised controlled trials, have shown favourable outcomes compared to non-TIPSS treatment of PVT complications. Outcomes of TIPSS with PVT appear similar to those in TIPSS without PVT. However TIPSS may be more technically difficult in the presence of PVT, and such procedures should be performed in high-volume expert centres to mitigate the risk of procedural complications. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of PVT should no longer be considered a contraindication to TIPSS. TIPSS for PVT has been acknowledged as a therapeutic strategy in recent international guidelines, although further studies are needed before recommendations can be strengthened.

363467,"The virus, the disease and the inequality",2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unparalleled changes to patient care, including the suspension of cancer surgery. Concerns regarding COVID-19-related risks to patients and healthcare workers with the re-introduction of major complex minimally invasive and open surgery have been raised. This study examines the COVID-19 related risks to patients and healthcare workers following the re-introduction of major oesophago-gastric (EG) surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an international, multi-centre, observational study of consecutive patients treated by open and minimally invasive oesophagectomy and gastrectomy for malignant or benign disease. Patients were recruited from nine European centres serving regions with a high population incidence of COVID-19 between 1 May and 1 July 2020. The primary endpoint was 30-day COVID-19-related mortality. All staff involved in the operative care of patients were invited to complete a health-related survey to assess the incidence of COVID-19 in this group. RESULTS: In total, 158 patients were included in the study (71 oesophagectomy, 82 gastrectomy). Overall, 87 patients (57%) underwent MIS (59 oesophagectomy, 28 gastrectomy). A total of 403 staff were eligible for inclusion, of whom 313 (78%) completed the health survey. Approaches to mitigate against the risks of COVID-19 for patients and staff varied amongst centres. No patients developed COVID-19 in the post-operative period. Two healthcare workers developed self-limiting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Precautions to minimise the risk of COVID-19 infection have enabled the safe re-introduction of minimally invasive and open EG surgery for both patients and staff. Further studies are necessary to determine the minimum requirements for mitigations against COVID-19.","Alasmar, Mohamed; Kausar, Afsana; Borgstein, Alexander Berend-Jan; Moons, Johnny; Doran, Sophie; de Pascale, Stefano; Restrepo, Rafael; Verrengia, Apollonia; Alloggio, Mariella; Delgado, Ana Moro; Kumar, Sacheen; Del Val, Ismael Díez; Giocapuzzi, Simone; Baiocchi, Gian Luca; de Vega Irañeta, Marta; Salcedo, Gabriel; Vorwald, Peter; Fumagalli Romario, Uberto; Nafteux, Philippe; Gisbertz, Suzanne; Chaudry, Mohammed Asif; Alkhaffaf, Bilal",Ann. surg. oncol,,12

367211,Research progress on coronavirus and its therapeutic drugs,2020,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, schools across North America closed to in person learning in March 2020. Since then, it has becoming increasingly clear that physical distancing will need to be prolonged in the 2020/2021 school year and possibly resumed in the future. In response, education ministries shifted teaching and learning online. Research is urgently needed to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on teaching and learning, particularly in the foundational early primary years. This research directly responds to this concern by examining the unique challenges associated with remote teaching and learning in early primary contexts. Given that learning in kindergarten and early primary grades is largely play- and inquiry- based, there is a particular need to investigate the impacts of this move for teachers, parents, and children in K-2. As such, the purpose of this research is twofold: (1) to capture the unique challenges and unanticipated successes associated with remote teaching and learning, and (2) to utilize findings to provide recommendations for remote learning as well as strategies for supporting in-person learning in the COVID-19 era (and post COVID-19 era). Data collection included 45-min semi-structured interviews with K-2 teachers (n = 25) and parents (n =11). All participants were from Ontario Canada. Data were collected from April-June 2020. The sample size was chosen to ensure saturation while uncovering a variety of perspectives. Data were analyzed in NVivo using an emergent thematic approach (Patton, 2016). The emergent thematic approach to analysis revealed five themes: equity considerations, synchronous versus asynchronous teaching and learning, social and emotional effects on students, academic impacts, and effects on parents/families.","Timmons, Kristy; Cooper, Amanda; Bozek, Emma; Braund, Heather",Early Child Educ J,,12

Stress responses are particularly important in stem cells that provide lifetime support for tissue formation and repair, but how these protective systems are integrated into developmental programs is poorly understood. Here we used myoblast differentiation to identify the E3 ligase CUL2FEM1B and its substrate FNIP1 as core components of the reductive stress response. Reductive stress, as caused by prolonged antioxidant signaling or mitochondrial inactivity, reverts the oxidation of invariant Cys residues in FNIP1 and allows CUL2FEM1B to recognize its target. The ensuing proteasomal degradation of FNIP1 restores mitochondrial activity to preserve redox homeostasis and stem cell integrity. The reductive stress response is therefore built around a ubiquitin-dependent rheostat that tunes mitochondrial activity to redox needs and implicates metabolic control in coordination of stress and developmental signaling.","Manford, Andrew G; Rodríguez-Pérez, Fernando; Shih, Karen Y; Shi, Zhuo; Berdan, Charles A; Choe, Mangyu; Titov, Denis V; Nomura, Daniel K; Rape, Michael",Cell,,12

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities among COVID-19 patients and their mortality risks with each category of pre-existing comorbidity. Methods: To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched using pre-specified search strategies. Further searches were conducted using the reference list of the selected studies, renowned preprint servers (eg, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN), and relevant journals' websites. Studies written in the English language included if those were conducted among COVID-19 patients with and without comorbidities and presented survivor vs non-survivor counts or hazard/odds of deaths or survivors with types of pre-existing comorbidities. Comorbidities reported in the selected studies were grouped into eight categories. The pooled likelihoods of deaths in each category were estimated using a fixed or random-effect model, based on the heterogeneity assessment. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot asymmetry and Egger's regression test. Trim and Fill method was used if there any publication bias was found. Results: A total of 41 studies included in this study comprised of 27 670 samples. The most common pre-existing comorbidities in COVID-19 patients were hypertension (39.5%), cardiovascular disease (12.4%), and diabetes (25.2%). The higher likelihood of deaths was found among COVID-19 patients who had pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (odds ratio (OR) = 3.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.86-4.09), immune and metabolic disorders (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 2.03-2.85), respiratory diseases (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.72-2.19), cerebrovascular diseases (OR = 4.12, 95% CI = 3.04-5.58), any types of cancers (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.63-3.03), renal (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 2.60-3.51), and liver diseases (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.50-3.69). Conclusions: This study provides evidence that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing comorbidities had a higher likelihood of death. These findings could potentially help health care providers to sort out the most susceptible COVID-19 patients by comorbidities, take precautionary measures during hospitalization, assess susceptibility to death, and prioritize their treatment, which could potentially reduce the number of fatalities in COVID-19.","Khan, Md Mostaured Ali; Khan, Md Nuruzzaman; Mustagir, Md Golam; Rana, Juwel; Islam, Md Saiful; Kabir, Md Iqbal",J Glob Health,,12

Although, most of the regions around the globe have been affected by COVID-19 infections; some regions are more badly affected in terms of infections and fatality rates than others. The exact reasons for such variations are not clear yet. This review discussed the possible effects of air pollution on COVID-19 infections and mortality based on some recent evidence. The findings of most studies reviewed here demonstrate that both short-term and long-term exposure to air pollution especially PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) may contribute significantly to higher rates of COVID-19 infections and mortalities with a lesser extent also PM10. A significant correlation has been found between air pollution and COVID-19 infections and mortality in some countries in the world. The available data also indicate that exposure to air pollution may influence COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, exposure to air pollution may increase vulnerability and have harmful effects on the prognosis of patients affected by COVID-19 infections. Further research should be conducted considering some potential confounders such as age and pre-existing medical conditions along with exposure to NO2, PM2.5 and other air pollutants to confirm their detrimental effects on mortalities from COVID-19.","Ali, Nurshad; Islam, Farjana",Front Public Health,,12

378882,The Main Sources and Potential Effects of COVID-19-Related Discrimination,2021,"Bats are known to be potential reservoirs of numerous human-pathogenic viruses. They have been identified as natural hosts for coronaviruses, causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in humans. Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 interest in the prevalence of coronaviruses in bats was newly raised. In this study we investigated different bat species living in a sympatric colony in the Wavul Galge cave (Koslanda, Sri Lanka). In three field sessions (in 2018 and 2019), 395 bats were captured (Miniopterus, Rousettus, Hipposideros and Rhinolophus spp.) and either rectal swabs or fecal samples were collected. From these overall 396 rectal swab and fecal samples, the screening for coronaviruses with nested PCR resulted in 33 positive samples, 31 of which originated from Miniopterus fuliginosus and two from Rousettus leschenaultii. Sanger sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the obtained 384-nt fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase revealed that the examined M. fuliginosus bats excrete alphacoronaviruses and the examined R. leschenaultii bats excrete betacoronaviruses. Despite the sympatric roosting habitat, the coronaviruses showed host specificity and seemed to be limited to one species. Our results represent an important basis to better understand the prevalence of coronaviruses in Sri Lankan bats and may provide a basis for pursuing studies on particular bat species of interest.","Muzeniek, Therese Perera Thejanee Siriwardana Sahan Dilara Bas Kaplan Fatimanur Öruc Mizgin Becker-Ziaja Beate Schwarz Franziska Premawansa Gayani Premawansa Sunil Perera Inoka Yapa Wipula Nitsche Andreas Kohl Claudia",Vaccines,,12

In recent decades, biotechnological advances have led to the development of numerous innovative therapeutic molecules and vaccine immunogens. However, we still lack effective treatments and vaccines against many respiratory pathogens. More than ever, there is a need for a fast, predictive, preclinical pipeline, to keep pace with emerging diseases. Animal models are key for the preclinical development of disease management strategies. The predictive value of these models depends on their ability to reproduce the features of the human disease, the mode of transmission of the infectious agent and the availability of technologies for monitoring infection. This review focuses on the use of non-human primates as relevant preclinical models for the development of prevention and treatment for human respiratory infections.","Lemaitre, Julien; Naninck, Thibaut; Delache, Benoît; Creppy, Justina; Huber, Philippe; Holzapfel, Marion; Bouillier, Camille; Contreras, Vanessa; Martinon, Frédéric; Kahlaoui, Nidhal; Pascal, Quentin; Tricot, Sabine; Ducancel, Frédéric; Vecellio, Laurent; Le Grand, Roger; Maisonnasse, Pauline",Mol Immunol,,12

Preclinical trials showed the effectiveness of domestic inactivated vaccine candidates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it is necessary to evaluate the willingness of the public to receive future domestic vaccines and to understand factors associated with willingness at the early stages of vaccine development. What is added by this report? Through May 25, 2020, 70.48% were willing to receive future domestic COVID-19 vaccines. Confidence in vaccines had the largest impact on public willingness, while age and presence of underlying chronic disease did not significantly increase public willingness. What are the implications for public health practice? It is necessary to increase awareness of COVID-19 vaccines among people with high risk of severe infection and to build public confidence in vaccines. Releasing accurate, timely, and reliable data to the public can help increase willingness to get vaccinated.","Rui, Ma Luodan Suo Li Lu Xinghuo Pang",China CDC Weekly,,12
383093,Oxidative Stress in Vascular Pathophysiology: Still Much to Learn,2021,"BACKGROUND: More than 79.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1.7 million deaths were caused by SARS-CoV-2; the disease was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Control of the COVID-19 epidemic has become a crucial issue around the globe, but there are limited studies that investigate the global trend of the COVID-19 pandemic together with each country's policy measures. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop an online artificial intelligence (AI) system to analyze the dynamic trend of the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitate forecasting and predictive modeling, and produce a heat map visualization of policy measures in 171 countries. METHODS: The COVID-19 Pandemic AI System (CPAIS) integrated two data sets: the data set from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker from the Blavatnik School of Government, which is maintained by the University of Oxford, and the data set from the COVID-19 Data Repository, which was established by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. This study utilized four statistical and deep learning techniques for forecasting: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), feedforward neural network (FNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and long short-term memory (LSTM). With regard to 1-year records (ie, whole time series data), records from the last 14 days served as the validation set to evaluate the performance of the forecast, whereas earlier records served as the training set. RESULTS: A total of 171 countries that featured in both databases were included in the online system. The CPAIS was developed to explore variations, trends, and forecasts related to the COVID-19 pandemic across several counties. For instance, the number of confirmed monthly cases in the United States reached a local peak in July 2020 and another peak of 6,368,591 in December 2020. A dynamic heat map with policy measures depicts changes in COVID-19 measures for each country. A total of 19 measures were embedded within the three sections presented on the website, and only 4 of the 19 measures were continuous measures related to financial support or investment. Deep learning models were used to enable COVID-19 forecasting; the performances of ARIMA, FNN, and the MLP neural network were not stable because their forecast accuracy was only better than LSTM for a few countries. LSTM demonstrated the best forecast accuracy for Canada, as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were 2272.551, 1501.248, and 0.2723075, respectively. ARIMA (RMSE=317.53169; MAPE=0.4641688) and FNN (RMSE=181.29894; MAPE=0.2708482) demonstrated better performance for South Korea. CONCLUSIONS: The CPAIS collects and summarizes information about the COVID-19 pandemic and offers data visualization and deep learning-based prediction. It might be a useful reference for predicting a serious outbreak or epidemic. Moreover, the system undergoes daily updates and includes the latest information on vaccination, which may change the dynamics of the pandemic.","Yu, Cheng-Sheng; Chang, Shy-Shin; Chang, Tzu-Hao; Wu, Jenny L; Lin, Yu-Jiun; Chien, Hsiung-Fei; Chen, Ray-Jade",J Med Internet Res,,12

383803,Coronavirus: Scientometrics of 50 Years of Global Scientific Productions,2020,"PURPOSE: To test the association between death and both qualitative and quantitative CT parameters obtained visually and by software in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) early outbreak. METHODS: The study analyzed retrospectively patients underwent chest CT at hospital admission for COVID-19 pneumonia suspicion, between February 21 and March 6, 2020. CT was performed in case of hypoxemia or moderate-to-severe dyspnea. CT scans were analyzed for quantitative and qualitative features obtained visually and by software. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis examined the association between variables and overall survival (OS). Three models were built for stratification of mortality risk: clinical, clinical/visual CT evaluation, and clinical/software-based CT assessment. AUC for each model was used to assess performance in predicting death. RESULTS: The study included 248 patients (70% males, median age 68 years). Death occurred in 78/248 (32%) patients. Visual pneumonia extent > 40% (HR 2.15, 95% CI 1.2-3.85, P = 0.01), %high attenuation area - 700 HU > 35% (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.2-3.94, P = 0.01), exudative consolidations (HR 2.85-2.93, 95% CI 1.61-5.05/1.66-5.16, P < 0.001), visual CAC score > 1 (HR 2.76-3.32, 95% CI 1.4-5.45/1.71-6.46, P < 0.01/P < 0.001), and CT classified as COVID-19 and other disease (HR 1.92-2.03, 95% CI 1.01-3.67/1.06-3.9, P = 0.04/P = 0.03) were significantly associated with shorter OS. Models including CT parameters (AUC 0.911-0.913, 95% CI 0.873-0.95/0.875-0.952) were better predictors of death as compared to clinical model (AUC 0.869, 95% CI 0.816-0.922; P = 0.04 for both models).

Vaccination, an appropriate tool for the prevention of infection, should be guaranteed by means of proportionate interventions to defeat such inequality in populations and communities affected by a higher risk of infection. Equitable criteria of justice should be identified and applied with respect to access to vaccination and to the order in which it should be administered. This article analyzes, as regards the worldwide distribution of anti-COVID-19 vaccines, the various ways the principle of equity has been construed and applied or even overlooked. The main obstacle to equal access to vaccines is vaccine nationalism. The perception of equity varies with the differing reference values adopted. Adequate response to needs appears to be the principal rule for achieving the criterion of equity in line with distributive justice. Priorities must be set equitably based on rational parameters in accordance with current needs. The entire process must be governed by transparency, from parameter identification to implementation. The issue of equal access to vaccination affects the entire world population, necessitating specific protective interventions. In light of this, the World Health Organization (WHO) has devised the COVAX plan to ensure that even the poorest nations of the world receive the vaccine;certain initiatives are also supported by the European Union (EU). This pandemic has brought to the fore the need to build a culture of equitable relationships both in each country’s own domain and with the rest of the world.","Bolcato, Matteo Rodriguez Daniele Feola Alessandro Di Mizio Giulio Bonsignore Alessandro Ciliberti Rosagemma Tettamanti Camilla Trabucco Aurilio Marco Aprile Anna",Vaccines,,12
384600,Electrofluidic control of bioactive molecule delivery into soft tissue models based on gelatin methacryloyl hydrogels using threads and surgical sutures,2020,"Niemann Pick type C2 (NPC2) is a small sterol binding protein in the lumen of late endosomes and lysosomes. We showed recently that the yeast homologue of NPC2 together with its binding partner NCR1 mediates integration of ergosterol, the main sterol in yeast, into the vacuolar membrane. Here, we study the binding specificity and the molecular details of lipid binding to yeast NPC2. We find that NPC2 binds fluorescence- and spin-labeled analogues of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol (PI), and sphingomyelin. Spectroscopic experiments show that NPC2 binds lipid monomers in solution but can also interact with lipid analogues in membranes. We further identify ergosterol, PC, and PI as endogenous NPC2 ligands. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that NPC2's binding pocket can adapt to the ligand shape and closes around bound ergosterol. Hydrophobic interactions stabilize the binding of ergosterol, but binding of phospholipids is additionally stabilized by electrostatic interactions at the mouth of the binding site. Our work identifies key residues that are important in stabilizing the binding of a phospholipid to yeast NPC2, thereby rationalizing future mutagenesis studies. Our results suggest that yeast NPC2 functions as a general ""lipid solubilizer"" and binds a variety of amphiphilic lipid ligands, possibly to prevent lipid micelle formation inside the vacuole.","Moesgaard, Laust; Petersen, Daniel; Szomek, Maria; Reinholdt, Peter; Winkler, Mikael B L; Frain, Kelly May; Müller, Peter; Pedersen, Bjørn Panyella; Kongsted, Jacob; Wüstner, Daniel",Biochemistry,,12

Thoracic computed tomography could not be obtained due to pregnancy. PCR testing was positive. The patient was treated with supportive care and anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agents; however, general health status deteriorated and patient was admitted to intensive care unit on day 3. After admission to COVID-19 ICU, clinical picture was rapidly worsened with development of respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, ""extracorporeal cytokine hemoadsorption"" (CytoSorb®, Cytosorbents Corporation, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) was planned and performed with regular intervals in order to remove inflammatory cytokines from circulation and to relieve systemic inflammatory response. The fever response and CRP elevation were controlled by hemoadsorption and cytokine filter performed in alternate days. On day 7 of ICU admission, it was decided to terminate pregnancy due to worsening hypoxemia and a healthy, premature infant was born. On day 2 after cesarean section, the patient was intubated and mechanical ventilation support was initiated. However, the patient showed an increasingly complicated clinical course and died on day 22 after ICU admission. It is seen that COVID-19 positivity carries an important risk for both mother and fetus, particularly in those at advanced stages of gestation, by physiological changes in the mother during pregnancy. We believe that, in the treatment of COVID-19 and its complications during pregnancy, cytokine filter treatment can give time to patient for hemodynamic and metabolic stabilization.","Karabulut Keklik, Esra Sultan; Dal, Hakan; Bozok, Sahin",SN Compr Clin Med,,12

At present, it is believed that the etiology of TMD is multifactor. The occlusal factors and the occurrence of TMD are weakly related, but there are some common malocclusions such as occlusal interference on non-working side, excessive sliding between maximum intercuspid position (MIP) and retruded contact position (RCP), unstable MIP and so on, may be risk factors that promote the disease. The occurrence of TMD symptoms is promoted under the combined action of behavior, biology, environment, social cognition, mentality and other comprehensive factors. In student education and clinical work, the risk of iatrogenic occlusal trauma in promoting the occurrence of TMD cannot be ignored. The impact of the patient's social and psychological environment on the TMD should be paid attention, and comprehensive treatment strategies is advocated.","Jiang, T",Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi,,12

Our aim was to describe RM daily temporal trends for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) recipients during COVID-19 infection. A 65-year-old woman with a CRT-D had a sudden increase of approximately 15 bpm and 10 bpm in nocturnal and mean heart rate, respectively, 11 days before hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia. At the same time physical activity decreased progressively and continuously. A 78-year-old woman with an ICD showed significant changes in RM trends starting from the COVID-19-related symptoms: strong decrease in physical activity, progressive increase in mean and nocturnal heart rate, irregular trend of heart rate variability, and rapid drop in thoracic impedance. Two months later, on hospitalization, computed tomography showed a ""crazy-paving"" pattern of the lungs, which is a clinical picture of COVID-19 pneumonia with concomitant pleural effusion. Learning objective Patients with complications related to the COVID-19 infection appeared to show variations in the remote monitoring (RM) temporal trends of clinical variables daily transmitted from implanted cardiac devices. These changes may not be specific to COVID-19, but owing to the severity of the pandemic, the use of RM to capture patient's condition makes intuitive sense for early diagnosis, intervention, and additional follow-up in this high-risk population.","Mascioli, Giosuè; Lucca, Elena; Annunziata, Lucia; Giacopelli, Daniele",,,12

The paper explains why property market forecasts fail, in a non-trivial sense, and why this problem is irredeemable.Design/methodology/approachThis was a conceptual paper and was based on original thought and literature review.FindingsThis paper attributes the failure of property market forecasts to the inappropriate application of the methodology of the natural sciences to the social sciences by mainstream economics. Specifically, the problem is located in the positivist philosophy and the assumptions of methodological individualism and rational choice theory underlying neoclassical economic theory.Originality/valueThe paper makes an original contribution by clearly showing why and how the methodology of the natural sciences, especially physics, has been applied to economics and property market analysis, why this is inappropriate and why it leads to failure.

Up to date, the dispersal pattern of airborne ARGs remains unclear despite their critical role in multiregional transmission. In this study, airborne ARGs loaded on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and source tracking based on the airflow trajectories were performed by the potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) model. The results show that the absolute abundance of ARG subtypes were generally twice times higher in the winter season than that in the summer season, which could be attributable to winter haze events with high particulate matter concentrations in Handan. Exogenous input from serious haze events and local release of ARGs loaded on PM2.5 of air masses may cause higher levels of ARGs in the winter. Moreover, based on the positive correlation between the abundance of ARGs and PM2.5 concentration, a source tracing model of airborne ARGs was proposed to the estimate of ARGs release and dissemination.

397084,Lymphocyte cell population as a potential hematological index for early diagnosis of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Up to 75% of hip fracture patients never recover to their pre-fracture functional status. Supervised exercise that includes strength training can improve functional recovery after hip fracture. The role of testosterone replacement for augmenting the effects of exercise in older women after hip fracture is unknown. METHODS: The Starting Testosterone and Exercise after Hip Injury (STEP-HI) Study is a 6-month Phase 3 multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to compare supervised exercise (EX) plus 1% testosterone topical gel, with EX plus placebo gel, and with enhanced usual care (EUC). Female hip fracture patients age &#8805; 65 years are being recruited from clinical centers across the United States. Participants are community dwelling and enrolled within 24 weeks after surgical repair of the fracture. The EX intervention is a center-based program of progressive resistance training. The EUC group receives a home exercise program and health education. Participants receive dietary counseling, calcium and vitamin D. The primary outcome is the Six Minute Walk Distance. Secondary outcomes include physical performance measures, self-reported function and quality of life, and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry measures of body composition and bone mineral density. RESULTS: Enrollment, interventions, and follow-up are ongoing. We describe the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the trial, including modifications made to allow continuation of the interventions and outcome data collection using remote video and audio technology. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the STEP-HI study are expected to have important clinical and public health implications for management of the growing population of hip fracture patients.","Binder, Ellen F; Christensen, Jesse C; Stevens-Lapsley, Jennifer; Bartley, Jenna; Berry, Sarah D; Dobs, Adrian S; Fortinsky, Richard H; Hildreth, Kerry L; Kiel, Douglas P; Kuchel, George A; Marcus, Robin L; McDonough, Christine M; Orwig, Denise; Sinacore, David R; Schwartz, Robert S; Volpi, Elena; Magaziner, Jay; Schechtman, Kenneth B",Contemp Clin Trials,,12

PURPOSE: In this study, a deep learning algorithm-based AI model using ResUNet network was developed to evaluate the performance of radiologists with and without AI assistance in distinguishing COVID-19 infected pneumonia patients from other pulmonary infections on CT scans. METHODS: For model development and validation, a total number of 694 cases with 111,066 CT slides were retrospectively collected as training data and independent test data in the study. Among them, 118 are confirmed COVID-19 infected pneumonia cases and 576 are other pulmonary infections cases (e.g. tuberculosis cases, common pneumonia cases and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia cases). The cases were divided into training and testing datasets. The independent test was performed by evaluating and comparing the performance of three radiologists with different years of practice experience in distinguishing COVID-19 infected pneumonia cases with and without the AI assistance. RESULTS: Our final model achieved an overall test accuracy of 0.914 with an area of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.903 in which the sensitivity and specificity are 0.918 and 0.909, respectively. The deep learning-based model then achieved a comparable performance by improving the radiologists' performance in distinguish COVOD-19 from other pulmonary infections, yielding better average accuracy and sensitivity, from 0.941 to 0.951 and from 0.895 to 0.942, respectively, when compared to radiologists without using AI assistance. CONCLUSION: A deep learning algorithm-based AI model developed in this study successfully improved radiologists' performance in distinguishing COVID-19 from other pulmonary infections using chest CT images.","Yang, Yanhong; Lure, Fleming Y M; Miao, Hengyuan; Zhang, Ziqi; Jaeger, Stefan; Liu, Jinxin; Guo, Lin",,,12

We aim to discover sensitive and reliable early-warning biomarkers for optimizing management and improving the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 2954 consecutive COVID-19 patients who were receiving treatment from the Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital in China from February 4 to April 10 were included in this retrospective cohort. Serum levels of cardiac markers were collected after admission. Coronary artery disease diagnosis and survival status were recorded. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and bulk RNA-sequencing from different cohorts of non-COVID-19 were performed to analyze SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression. RESULTS: Among 2954 COVID-19 patients in the analysis, the median age was 60 years (50-68 years), 1461 (49.5%) were female, and 1515 (51.3%) were severe/critical. Compared to mild/moderate (1439, 48.7%) patients, severe/critical patients showed significantly higher levels of cardiac markers within the first week after admission. In severe/critical COVID-19 patients, those with abnormal serum levels of BNP (42 [24.6%] vs 7 [1.1%]), hs-TNI (38 [48.1%] vs 6 [1.0%]), &#945;- HBDH (55 [10.4%] vs 2 [0.2%]), CK-MB (45 [36.3%] vs 12 [0.9%]), and LDH (56 [12.5%] vs 1 [0.1%]) had a significantly higher mortality rate compared to patients with normal levels. The same trend was observed in the ICU admission rate. Severe/critical COVID-19 patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease (165/1,155 [10.9%]) had more cases of BNP (52 [46.5%] vs 119 [16.5%]), hs-TNI (24 [26.7%] vs 9.6 [%], &#945;- HBDH (86 [55.5%] vs 443 [34.4%]), CK-MB (27 [17.4%] vs 97 [7.5%]), and LDH (65 [41.9%] vs 382 [29.7%]), when compared with those without coronary artery disease. There was enhanced SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression in coronary artery disease compared with healthy controls. From regression analysis, patients with five elevated cardiac markers were at a higher risk of death (hazards ratio 3.4 [95% CI 2.4-4.8]). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease represented a higher abnormal percentage of cardiac markers, accompanied by high mortality and ICU admission rate. BNP together with hs-TNI, &#945;- HBDH, CK-MB and LDH act as a prognostic biomarker in COVID-19 patients with or without pre-existing coronary artery disease.","Li, Pengping; Wu, Wei; Zhang, Tingting; Wang, Ziyu; Li, Jie; Zhu, Mengyan; Liang, Yuan; You, Wenhua; Li, Kening; Ding, Rong; Huang, Bin; Wu, Lingxiang; Duan, Weiwei; Han, Yi; Li, Xuesong; Tang, Xin; Wang, Xin; Shen, Han; Wang, Qianghu; Yan, Hong; Xia, Xinyi; Ji, Yong; Chen, Hongshan",Crit Care,,12

The order is split into two suborders with a total of 24 families, 282 genera and ca. 2,100 species. Here, we present an expanded phylogeny of characiform fishes, including data for 520 species and three genes (12S, 16S and RAG1), and the recently described family Tarumaniidae, which has not been examined by previous molecular analysis. Although our genetic coverage is limited to three gene fragments, the tree inferred based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference supports the monophyly of all characiform families and is largely congruent with results from recent studies that sampled less taxa but more genes. Also in agreement with a morphological hypothesis, our results strongly support the sister-group relationships between the family Tarumaniidae and Erythrinidae. Based on our results and that of the other molecular analyses, we propose a revised circumscription of the superfamily Erythrinoidea to include the families Tarumaniidae and Erythrinidae only.(AU)","Arcila, Dahiana; Petry, Paulo; Ortí, Guillermo",Neotrop. ichthyol,,12

Therefore, the objective of this review is to summarize emerging evidence on the vertical transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and CENTRAL. Likewise, a search for preprint publications was conducted using MedRxiv and Research Square. Studies that addressed vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (concept) among pregnant women infected by Covid-19 (population) in any setting (community, hospital, or home) in any country or context were considered for inclusion. Any types of studies or reports published between December 2019 and September 2020 addressing the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnant women and their newborn babies were included. Studies were screened for eligibility against the inclusion criteria for the review by two reviewers. RESULTS: We identified 51 studies reporting 336 newborns screened for COVID-19. From the 336 newborns screened for COVID-19, only 15 (4.4%) were positive for throat swab RT-PCR. All neonates with positive throat swab RT-PCR were delivered by cesarean section. Among neonates with throat swab SARS-CoV-2 positive only five (33.3%) had concomitant placenta, amniotic fluid, and cord blood samples tested, of which only one amniotic fluid sample is positive for RT PCR. Five neonates had elevated IgG and IgM but without intrauterine tissue tested. Four neonates had chest imaging suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Currently there is not enough evidence on vertical virologic transmission of COVID-19 infection during the third trimester of pregnancy. Additionally, there is no evidence to support cesarean delivery, abstaining from breast feeding nor mother and infant separation. Further research involving an adequate sample size of breast milk, placenta, amniotic fluid, and cord blood to ascertain the possibility of vertical transmission and breast milk transfer is needed.","Tolu, Lemi Belay; Ezeh, Alex; Feyissa, Garumma Tolu",PLoS One,,12

Desde entonces fue necesario internar pacientes pediátricos en el Hospital Nacional Edgardo Rebagliati Martins, en el área de hospitalización adaptada para dicho propósito. Al inicio, la demanda de hospitalización era baja y se fue incrementando progresivamente. Coincidiendo con los reportes internacionales, la mayoría presentó cuadros leves o moderados, pero también hubo casos graves e incluso mortales. Objetivos Describir las características y el desenlace clínico de los pacientes pediátricos con COVID-19 hospitalizados en un hospital de referencia en Lima, Perú, entre marzo y agosto de 2020. Métodos Se realizó un estudio transversal descriptivo e inferencial. La población incluyó a todos los pacientes que se hospitalizaron en el Departamento de Pediatría Clínica, con diagnósticos clínicos y quirúrgicos asociados a COVID-19. Resultados Incluimos 100 pacientes, con edad promedio de 83,4 ± 54 meses, con predominio de varones (55%). Los pacientes hospitalizados fueron agrupados en cinco categorías: insuficiencia respiratoria (17%), síndrome inflamatorio multisistémico (31%), presentación neurológica (19%), abdomen agudo (20%) y pacientes con problemas oncológicos (13%). La mayoría de los pacientes (74%) tenían comorbilidades. Respecto a los síntomas de presentación, el dolor intestinal predominó en el grupo de apendicitis (90%, p < 0,001), la fiebre estuvo presente en la mayoría de los pacientes con falla respiratoria (64,7%), el síndrome inflamatorio multisistémico se registró en 90,3%, la sintomatología neurológica en 15,8%, el abdomen agudo 50% y oncológicos en 61,5% de los pacientes. Los síntomas de Kawasaki estuvieron presentes en 38,7% de los pacientes con síndrome inflamatorio multisistémico. La mortalidad fue de 4%. En 29,4% de problemas respiratorios y en 22,6% de síndrome inflamatorio multisistémico, se requirió de admisión en cuidados intensivos, lo que fue más frecuente que las otras presentaciones (p = 0,008). Conclusiones Se concluye que la población pediátrica vulnerable es aquella con comorbilidades preexistentes.

Recent investigations from Sweden and the US have indicated that pregnant and postpartum women are at increased risk of severe complications associated with COVID‐19. This study aims to find out the prevalence of maternal mortality and the clinical course of maternal mortality cases due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 1st, 2020, to April 30th, 2021, at Postgraduate Institute and YCM Hospital Pimpri Pune (Maharashtra), a dedicated COVID hospital during COVID pandemic. During study period, all pregnant women who were diagnosed to have COVID-19 infection by RT PCR/Rapid Antigen Test were admitted and were enrolled for the study. Aim To audit the maternal mortality due to COVID-19 infection. Primary To estimate the prevalence of maternal mortality due to COVID-19 infection in obstetric patients. Secondary To systematically study and analyze the clinical course of infection in mothers who had mortality due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Data collected in standard format regarding Demography, clinical presentation, need for ICU/HDU, CXR findings, laboratory parameters and cases with maternal mortality were studied in detail to fulfill the study objectives. Results Among 871 COVID-19 cases diagnosed during pregnancy, nine patients had maternal mortality due to covid pneumonia. There was no obvious obstetric cause for mortality in these cases. The prevalence of maternal mortality was 0.01 (1.03%). Cases with maternal mortality were mostly in 3rd Trimester (5 of 9 cases) and presented with moderate to severe illness with breathlessness and myalgia in all 9 cases, cough and fever in 7 out of 9 cases, Tachypneoa was noted in all patients. Saturation below 90 in 6 cases and below 94 in 3 cases. Chest X-ray showed bilateral lung affection in all 9 cases. Leukocytosis with raised N:L ratio was predominantly seen, thrombocytopenia noted in 5 cases and elevated levels of acute phase reactants and inflammatory markers such as CRP, S. ferritin, ESR, LDH, D-dimer and S. fibrinogen was observed. None of the study participants received vaccine for COVID-19. Conclusions COVID-19 pneumonia is an additional toll for maternal mortality. Obstetric patients in 2nd and 3rd trimester having COVID-19 infection with late presentation to hospital, moderate to severe disease (RR > 30 min), with raised inflammatory markers (N:L ratio, CRP, Ferritin, d-Dimer, etc.) at presentation, having bilateral lung affection are at risk of poor maternal outcome.","Asalkar, Mahesh Thakkarwad Smita Rumani Ilaaf Sharma Nitika",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology of India,,12

Amid current circumstances, the UDS, which had evolved to signal a ""successful"" recovery, no longer seems feasible, safe, or necessary. Even prior to the pandemic, the UDS had notable drawbacks, including sending a message of mistrust and hierarchy, potentially causing psychological trauma, and incentivizing falsification. Nonetheless, certain patients may state that they depend on the UDS for motivation or structure while some providers may rely on it to discover which patients are struggling. While a combination of self-report and UDS is generally regarded as the strongest measure of substance use among patients, our experiences caring for patients without the results of the UDS during the COVID-19 pandemic have forced us to examine the use of other measures to define a successful recovery. Complete abstinence may not be the goal for all patients and those who achieve abstinence may have additional goals worth supporting. While the UDS will likely be incorporated back into our treatment plans, we suggest unseating it as the centerpiece of substance use care and discovering additional methods of measuring our patients' outcomes in less traumatizing and more patient-centered ways.","Khatri, Utsha G; Aronowitz, Shoshana V",J Subst Abuse Treat,,12

This review discusses racial-ethnic differences in COVID-19 related outcomes with an emphasis on the social determinants of health that are responsible for these disparities. RECENT FINDINGS: Higher hospitalizations and deaths have been reported amongst minority individuals after a COVID-19 infection. Cardiovascular disease and its risk factors are also more common in minority populations and negatively impact clinical outcomes after a COVID-19 illness. The racial disparities seen after COVID-19 infections appear to be driven by multiple preexisting comorbidities, adverse socioeconomic conditions, and lack of access to healthcare. These disadvantages were present before the COVID-19 pandemic. To effectively reduce disparities in outcomes of COVID-19 and the impact of the virus on minority communities, a multifaceted approach will be needed. SUMMARY: Government-backed policies that foster health equity and promote easily accessible testing and fair distribution of COVID-19 therapies and vaccines are necessary to successfully combat racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes.","Aleligne, Yeabsra Kefyalew; Appiah, Duke; Ebong, Imo A",Curr Opin Cardiol,,12

411223,Nanoemulsions: the rising star of antiviral therapeutics and nano-delivery system - current status and prospects,2021,"Resolution level and reconstruction quality in nano-computed tomography (nano-CT) are in part limited by the stability of microscopes, because the magnitude of mechanical vibrations during scanning becomes comparable to the imaging resolution, and the ability of the samples to resist beam damage during data acquisition. In such cases, there is no incentive in recovering the sample state at different time steps like in time-resolved reconstruction methods, but instead the goal is to retrieve a single reconstruction at the highest possible spatial resolution and without any imaging artifacts. Here we propose a joint solver for imaging samples at the nanoscale with projection alignment, unwarping and regularization. Projection data consistency is regulated by dense optical flow estimated by Farneback's algorithm, leading to sharp sample reconstructions with less artifacts. Synthetic data tests show robustness of the method to Poisson and low-frequency background noise. Applicability of the method is demonstrated on two large-scale nano-imaging experimental data sets.","Nikitin, Viktor; Andrade, Vincent De; Slyamov, Azat; Gould, Benjamin J.; Zhang, Yuepeng; Sampathkumar, Vandana; Kasthuri, Narayanan; Gursoy, Doga; Carlo, Francesco De",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03375v1.pdf,12

413880,Activated sludge microbiome in a membrane bioreactor for treating Ramen noodle-soup wastewater,2020,"Photolithography has been a major enabling tool for miniaturisation of silicon devices that underpinned the electronics revolution. Rapid, high-resolution patterning of key material characteristics would, similarly, accelerate the advent of molecular electronics and photonics. Here we advance a versatile approach employing local diffusion of functional small-molecular compounds through a solution-processed 'molecular gate' interlayer. Diffusion is activated using laser light or solvent vapour jets-a process that can be finely modulated down to molecule-on-demand deposition precision with almost photolithographic resolution (<5 µm) and speeds (3 mm s-1). Examples of principal pattern types are presented including molecular conformation for integrated photonics; chain orientation for polarised security features and micro-engineered electronics; and doping with local conductivity values >3 S cm-1 for improved electronic devices. Finally, we demonstrate the unique capability for one-step patterning of multiple functionalities by spatially modulating composition in ternary blends, leading to locally tunable photoluminescence from blue to red.","Perevedentsev, Aleksandr; Campoy-Quiles, Mariano",Nat Commun,,12

414219,On‐Chip Mercury‐Free Deep‐UV Light‐Emitting Sources with Ultrahigh Germicidal Efficiency,2021,"Background: Quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection requires medical personnel and is time consuming, and thus is poorly suited to mass screening. In June, 2020, a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA; Lumipulse G SARS-CoV-2 Ag kit, Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan) was developed that can detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleoproteins in NPS or saliva samples within 35 min. In this study, we assessed the utility of CLEIA in mass SARS-CoV-2 screening. Methods: We did a diagnostic accuracy study to develop a mass-screening strategy for salivary detection of SARS-CoV-2 by CLEIA, enrolling hospitalised patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, close contacts identified at community health centres, and asymptomatic international arrivals at two airports, all based in Japan. All test participants were enrolled consecutively. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of CLEIA compared with RT-qPCR, estimated according to concordance (Kendall's coefficient of concordance, W), and sensitivity (probability of CLEIA positivity given RT-qPCR positivity) and specificity (probability of CLEIA negativity given RT-qPCR negativity) for different antigen concentration cutoffs (0·19 pg/mL, 0·67 pg/mL, and 4·00 pg/mL; with samples considered positive if the antigen concentration was equal to or more than the cutoff and negative if it was less than the cutoff). We also assessed a two-step testing strategy post hoc with CLEIA as an initial test, using separate antigen cutoff values for test negativity and positivity from the predefined cutoff values. The proportion of intermediate results requiring secondary RT-qPCR was then quantified assuming prevalence values of RT-qPCR positivity in the overall tested population of 10%, 30%, and 50%. Findings: Self-collected saliva was obtained from 2056 participants between June 12 and Aug 6, 2020. Results of CLEIA and RT-qPCR were concordant in 2020 (98·2%) samples (Kendall's W=0·99). Test sensitivity was 85·4% (76 of 89 positive samples; 90% credible interval [CrI] 78·0-90·3) at the cutoff of 0·19 pg/mL; 76·4% (68 of 89; 68·2-82·8) at the cutoff of 0·67 pg/mL; and 52·8% (47 of 89; 44·1-61·3) at the cutoff of 4·0 pg/mL. Test specificity was 91·3% (1796 of 1967 negative samples; 90% CrI 90·2-92·3) at the cutoff of 0·19 pg/mL, 99·2% (1952 of 1967; 98·8-99·5) at the cutoff of 0·67 pg/mL, and 100·0% (1967 of 1967; 99·8-100·0) at the cutoff of 4·00 pg/mL. Using a two-step testing strategy with a CLEIA negativity cutoff of 0·19 pg/mL (to maximise sensitivity) and a CLEIA positivity cutoff of 4·00 pg/mL (to maximise specificity), the proportions of indeterminate results (ie, samples requiring secondary RT-qPCR) would be approximately 11% assuming a prevalence of RT-qPCR positivity of 10%, 16% assuming a prevalence of RT-qPCR positivity of 30%, and 21% assuming a prevalence of RT-qPCR positivity of 50%. Interpretation: CLEIA testing of self-collected saliva is simple and provides results quickly, and is thus suitable for mass testing. To improve accuracy, we propose a two-step screening strategy with an initial CLEIA test followed by confirmatory RT-qPCR for intermediate concentrations, varying positive and negative thresholds depending on local prevalence. Implementation of this strategy has expedited sample processing at Japanese airports since July, 2020, and might apply to other large-scale mass screening initiatives.

414627,IL-18-dependent MAIT cell activation in COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients with acne vulgaris continue to present increasingly in dermatology outpatient clinics and seek treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. As far as we know, the effect of isotretinoin on COVID-19 has not been studied before. AIM: We aimed to evaluate whether patients receiving oral isotretinoin are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection by comparing them with patients on topical treatment for acne vulgaris. METHODS: The data were collected retrospectively from a cohort of 267 acne vulgaris patients, who were under follow-up for acne vulgaris treatment during the pandemic period. RESULTS: Total of 227 patients (141 receiving isotretinoin treatment and 86 receiving topical treatment) were included of whom 29 patients had COVID-19 infection during acne vulgaris treatment. Fifteen (10.6%) patients were receiving oral isotretinoin and 14 (16.3%) were receiving topical acne treatment at the time of COVID-19 infection. The mean cumulative dose was 2340 ± 1988 mg at the time of COVID-19 infection. The mean elapsed time between the onset of isotretinoin treatment and positive PCR result for COVID-19 was 13.3 ± 10.3 weeks. Nine patients (64.3%) receiving isotretinoin treatment and 9 patients (60%) under topical treatment had loss of taste and smell during COVID-19 infection. Isotretinoin treatment was not found to be associated with a significant increased risk of getting COVID-19 (odds ratio, 0.671; 95% confidence interval, 0.247-1.823; P = 0.434). CONCLUSION: As a conclusion, the results of this study encourage dermatologists and acne vulgaris patients to initiate oral isotretinoin treatment safely during the pandemic period.","Demirel Ögüt, Neslihan; Kutlu, Ömer; Erbagci, Ece",J. cosmet. dermatol,,12

419636,Human pathogen coronaviruses - An overview,2020,"Background: Schools and outdoor public spaces play a substantial role in children's physical activity. Yet, the COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates bound many children to their available home spaces for learning, movement, and development. The exact effect this mandate had on children's physical activity may vary among families. Objective: To understand, from the perspective of parents, how the COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates affected children's physical activity, while also considering families' socioeconomic status. Design: Open-ended survey. Setting: Online. Method: Data were collected from 321 parents living in the United States of America. Parents answered an open-ended prompt to describe their children's physical activity during COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates. Following data collection, inductive and deductive content analysis examined patterns in the data. Results: Analyses indicated that shelter-in-place mandates restricted children's opportunities for physical activity. However, if families had access to outdoor spaces or equipment, they could encourage and support more physical activity opportunities than those without. Families in the lower-income bracket had less access to outdoor space and subsequently those children had fewer opportunities to be physically active. Parents supported their children's physical activity through their involvement and encouragement. Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of access to outdoor spaces and equipment for increasing children's physical activity. Findings can be used by educators and policymakers to equitably support families of lower socioeconomic status who reported less access to outdoor spaces.","Perez, Deanna; Thalken, Janelle K; Ughelu, Nzubechukwu E; Knight, Camilla J; Massey, William V",Front Public Health,,12

424727,Redox Role of ROS and Inflammation in Pulmonary Diseases,2021,"Abstract The global shortage of reagents and kits for nucleic acid extraction and molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 requires new cost-effective strategies for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 cases, especially in countries that need to increase detection capacity. Pooled nucleic acid testing has been extensively used as a cost-effective strategy for HIV, HepB, HepC and influenza. Also, protocols dispensing of RNA extraction appears as an attractive option for detection of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we found that pooling of 5 samples showed that CT variations were in the range of 1.0-4,5 units, with less likelihood of a false negative result. Results of the sample without nucleic acid ex-traction, was unsatisfactory, with a significant increase in CT values, and thus for risk of a false negative result. In conclusion, pooling nasopharyngeal samples with both automated and manual extraction proved reliable, and thus a potential efficient alternative for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 in developing countries.","Farfan, Mauricio J; Torres, Juan P; ORyan, Miguel; Olivares, Mauricio; Gallardo, Pablo; Lastra, Jorge; Salas, Carolina",Rev. chil. infectol,,12
424728,Redox Role of ROS and Inflammation in Pulmonary Diseases,2021,"The immobilization of patients with a bite block (BB) carries the risk of interpersonal infection, particularly in the context of pandemics such as COVID-19. Here, we compared the intra-fractional patient setup error (intra-SE) with and without a BB during fractionated intracranial stereotactic irradiation (STI). Fifteen patients with brain metastases were immobilized using a BB without a medical mask, while 15 patients were immobilized without using a BB and with a medical mask. The intra-SEs in six directions (anterior-posterior (AP), superior-inferior (SI), left-right (LR), pitch, roll, and yaw) were calculated by using cone-beam computed tomography images acquired before and after the treatments. We analyzed a total of 53 and 67 treatment sessions for the with- and without-BB groups, respectively. A comparable absolute mean translational and rotational intra-SE was observed (P > 0.05) in the AP (0.19 vs 0.23 mm with- and without-BB, respectively), SI (0.30 vs 0.29 mm), LR (0.20 vs 0.29 mm), pitch (0.18 vs 0.27°), roll (0.23 vs 0.23°) and yaw (0.27 vs 22°) directions. The resultant planning target volume (PTV) margin to compensate for intra-SE was <1 mm. No statistically significant correlation was observed between the intra-SE and treatment times. A PTV margin of <1 mm was achieved even when patients were immobilized without a BB during STI dose delivery.","Ohira, Shingo; Kanayama, Naoyuki; Komiyama, Riho; Ikawa, Toshiki; Toratani, Masayasu; Ueda, Yoshihiro; Washio, Hayate; Miyazaki, Masayoshi; Koizumi, Masahiko; Teshima, Teruki",J Radiat Res,,12

As a result, the Swedish COVID-19 measures, largely devised by its expert agency on health, garnered widespread international attention. Despite the global interest in the corona strategy of the Public Health Agency of Sweden (PHAS), there are currently no systematic studies on their COVID-19 policy. The present investigation focuses on the controversies that have characterized PHAS' work with reference to risk assessments, facemasks, voluntarism, testing, and the protection of the elderly during the pandemic. Overall, this inquiry demonstrates that PHAS' risk assessments were initially overly optimistic and their facemask recommendations in conflict with large segments of the scientific community for an extensive period. Yet, their voluntary measures worked moderately well. In their testing, PHAS did not manage to deliver on their promises in time, whereas several measures implemented to protect the elderly were deemed inadequate and late.","Pashakhanlou, Arash Heydarian",,,12

425739,CD26/Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV and Its Multiple Biological Functions,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) results in a tremendous disease burden worldwide. Available research on active surveillance among hospitalized adult patients suffering from SARI in China is limited. This pilot study aimed to identify associated etiologies and describe the demographic, epidemiological and clinical profiles of hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years in Jinshan, Shanghai. METHODS: Active surveillance was conducted at 1 sentinel hospital in Jinshan district, Shanghai, from April 2017 to March 2018. Hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years old were enrolled, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected within 24 hours of admission and tested for multiple respiratory viruses (including 18 common viruses) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical information was obtained from case report forms. RESULTS: In total, 397 SARI patients were enrolled; the median age was 68 years, and 194 (48.9%) patients were male. A total of 278 (70.0%) patients had at least one underlying chronic medical condition. The most frequent symptoms were cough (99.2%) and sputum production (88.4%). The median duration of hospitalization was 10 days. A total of 250 infection patients (63.0%) were positive for at least one pathogen, of whom 198 (49.9%) were positive for a single pathogen and 52 (13.1%) were positive for multiple pathogens. The pathogens identified most frequently were M. pneumoniae (23.9%, 95/397), followed by adenovirus (AdV) (11.6%, 46/397), influenza virus A/H3N2 (Flu A/H3N2) (11.1%, 44/397), human rhinovirus (HRhV) (8.1%, 32/397), influenza virus B/Yamagata (Flu B/Yamagata) (6.3%, 25/397), pandemic influenza virus A/H1N1 (Flu A/pH1N1) (4.0%, 16/397), parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1 (2.0%, 8/397), human coronavirus (HCoV) type NL63 (2.0%, 8/397), HCoV 229E (1.5%, 6/397), HCoV HKU1 (1.5%, 6/397), PIV 3 (1.5%, 6/397), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (1.5%, 6/397), PIV 4 (1.3%, 5/397), HCoV OC43 (1.0%, 4/397), influenza virus B/Victoria (Flu B/Victoria) (0.5%, 2/397), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type B (0.5%, 2/397), and human bocavirus (HBoV) (0.3%, 1/397). The seasonality of pathogen-confirmed SARI patients had a bimodal distribution, with the first peak in the summer and the second peak in the winter. Statistically significant differences were observed with respect to the rates of dyspnea, radiographically diagnosed pneumonia and the presence of at least one comorbidity in patients who were infected with only M. pneumoniae, AdV, HRhV, Flu A/H3N2, Flu A /pH1N1 or Flu B/Yamagata. The differences in the positivity rates of the above 6 pathogens among the different age groups were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: M. pneumoniae, AdV and Flu A/H3N2 were the main pathogens detected in hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years old in Jinshan district, Shanghai. Our findings highlight the importance of sustained multipathogen surveillance among SARI patients in sentinel hospitals, which can provide useful information on SARI etiologies, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics.","Li, Jian; Song, Can-Lei; Wang, Tang; Ye, Yu-Long; Du, Jian-Ru; Li, Shu-Hua; Zhu, Jian-Min",PLoS One,,12

The World Health Organization recommends the Charité-Berlin protocol for COVID-19 diagnosis, which requires triple PCR, limiting the process capability of laboratories and delaying the results. In order to reduce these limitations, a duplex PCR is validated for the detection of the E and RNase P genes. METHODS: We compared the limit of detection, sensitivity and specificity of the duplex PCR technique (E gene and RNase P) against the monoplex standard (E gene) in RNA samples from a SARS-CoV-2 isolate and 88 clinical specimens with previously known results. The repeatability and reproducibility of the threshold cycle values (Ct) were determined in two independent laboratories of the Faculty of Medicine of the Universidad de Antioquia, using different reagents and real time instruments. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the Ct results between both techniques (p = 0.84). Using the monoplex PCR of E gene as a reference, the interrater reliability analysis showed similarity between the two techniques, with a kappa coefficient of 0.89, the sensitivity and the specificity of duplex PCR were 90% and 87%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Duplex PCR does not affect the sensitivity and specificity reported by the Charité, Berlin protocol, being a useful tool for SARS-CoV-2 screening in clinical samples.","Palacio Rua, Katherine; García Correa, Juan Felipe; Aguilar-Jiménez, Wbeimar; Afanador Ayala, Carlos; Rugeles, María Teresa; Zuluaga, Andrés F",Enferm. infecc. microbiol. clin.

434165,Modeling the spread of infectious disease in urban areas with travel contagion,2020-05-10,"BACKGROUND: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) practice is not well known. PURPOSE: This study aimed to describe state practice barriers and explore the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on APRN practice. METHODS: A descriptive study design used a 20-item web-based survey open from June 1 through September 23, 2020. FINDINGS: A total of 7,467 APRNs responded from all 50 states, including nurse practitioners (n = 6,478, 86.8%), certified registered nurse anesthetists (n = 592, 7.9%), certified nurse-midwives (n = 278, 3.7%), and clinical nurse specialists (n = 242, 3.2%). A number of barriers to practice prior to the pandemic were identified. Most respondents (n = 6334, 84.8%) identified that practice barriers limited the ability of APRNs to provide care during the pandemic. DISCUSSION: Barriers to APRN practice continue to restrict aspects of patient care and patient access to care, even in states with Full Practice Authority (FPA), during the COVID-19 pandemic and with state executive orders waiving practice restrictions. The study findings can be used to advocate for policy changes to support APRN practice authority.","Kleinpell, Ruth; Myers, Carole R; Schorn, Mavis N; Likes, Wendy",Nurs. outlook,,12

434994,Repurposing of Miltefosine as an Adjuvant for Influenza Vaccine,2020,"Background: Altered molecular signaling pathways in ameloblastoma have been identified to play a pivotal role in the mechanism of oncogenesis, differentiation, and tumor progression. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway is one of the signaling pathways that are associated with the pathogenesis of ameloblastoma. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) controls cell migration and proliferation. It monitors the level of the Akt and maintains cellular integrity. The present study was aimed to study the immunoexpression of PTEN in ameloblastoma to understand its role in the pathogenesis of ameloblastoma. Materials and Methods: Twenty cases of ameloblastoma and ten cases of normal tooth germ were subjected to immunohistochemical staining against PTEN. Results: Strong PTEN immunopositivity was seen in the tooth germs, while weak positivity was seen in the ameloblastoma. The immunoscore for PTEN was calculated by adding the percentage score and the intensity score. Seventeen cases showed the reduced PTEN expression in the epithelial component of ameloblastoma. The unpaired t-test showed a statistically significant difference in the mean PTEN immunoscore in tooth germ and ameloblastoma. Conclusion: The study showed reduced PTEN immunoreactivity, which plays a role in the pathogenesis of ameloblastoma, through Akt pathway.","Narayan, Bhaskar; Urs, Aadithya B; Augustine, Jeyaseelan; Singh, Hanspal",J Cancer Res Ther,,12

However, there are several psychosocial variables that can enhance resilient outcomes in adverse situations. The aim would be to establish the level of resilience of the general Spanish population exposed to a traumatic situation by the COVID-19 in order to identify which protective factors predict resilient outcomes. 1227 homebound people (863-70.3% women), aged 18-73 years (M = 28.10; SD = 12.88) reported on sociodemographic and psychological variables such as optimism, hope, self-efficacy and post-traumatic growth. Having a higher academic level (ß = .47; CI (95%) = .11-.34; p < .01), being autonomous (ß = .29; CI (95%) = 0.1-.09; p < .01), along with self-efficacy (ß = .42; CI (95%) = .71-92; p < .01) and to a lesser extent optimism (ß = .31; CI (95%) = .63-.84; p < .01) would be the predictive variables of a resilient outcome. A high level of statistical power (1-ß = 1) and effect size (f2 = 19.2) is observed. The Spanish population exposed to confinement presents high levels of resilience, but no relevant post-traumatic growth has taken place.

This paper uses HSR as a quasi-natural experiment to study the effect of HSR openings on green productivity in Chinese cities. The empirical results show that, first, the opening of HSR is conducive to the sustained improvement of green productivity in Chinese cities. Second, the opening of HSR makes a significant contribution to the improvement of green productivity in large-scale cities as well as cities in the east and central regions. Third, the opening of HSR can positively impact urban green productivity through the mechanism of green finance development. However, this positive impact tends to first increase and then decrease over time. As the relationship between “finance” and “environment,” green finance has an important impact on the green development of cities. These findings will provide positive and useful references for cities to formulate reasonable green development plans in the post-COVID-19 era.","Kong, Qunxi Shen Chenrong Peng Dan Wong Zoey",Global Finance Journal,,12

Dental professionals in resource poor countries, as opposed to those in developed countries, face additional challenges due to the lack of personal protective equipment, and chronic infrastructural impediments extant in such jurisdictions, such as regular and chronic interruptions to electricity and water supplies. OBJECTIVES: To address this new 'normal' which dictates that dentistry has to 'adapt and adopt' in order to deliver care to the needy, particularly in resource poor nations, whilst care deliverers take appropriate precautionary measures to obviate cross infection. METHODS: A review was preformed of the challenges to delivery of infection control measures in dentistry in resource meagre settings, and practical interventional measures proposed to mitigate these challenges, taking South Africa as a case study. RESULTS: In reality, optimal infection control measures cannot be implemented in delivering dental care in resource poor settings, a challenge that has been ill addressed by the relevant authoritative bodies. A re-adaptation of infection control guidelines that could be simply implemented in such settings has been formulated. CONCLUSION: We present practical infection control guidelines to lessen the burden of dental professionals in resource poor countries who dispense treatment under trying circumstance. The strategic infection control measures, including engineering and administrative controls outlined could be applicable in jurisdictions with a diminished capacity to respond to local, regional or national infection control guide-lines, due to financial, regulatory, or other infrastructural resource deficiencies.","Blignaut, Elaine; Nemutandani, Simon; Samaranayake, Lakshman",Acta Odontol Scand,,12

Yet, anthropologists have not typically sought study‐participant drawings. Using a protocol in which a request for a drawing was embedded, this study captures the internal dynamics of three successful university‐based teams. Our questions followed a specific Describe–Draw–Explain sequence. All interviewees offered some novel element in their drawings (Draw step) beyond what they conveyed in their verbal descriptions (Describe step), while 85 percent of them again offered additional detail in the Explain step. The data also revealed stark and surprising cultural contrasts across teams, including one that was understood best as a network that could be activated upon demand. Gathering drawings is a fast yet valid and reliable method when the prescribed sequence of questions is followed. Another virtue of this approach is that the interviews can be conducted virtually, essential during the COVID‐19 era.","Briody, Elizabeth K.; Fredy, Rodríguez‐Mejía King Julia Berger Edward",Annals of Anthropological Practice,,12

It is therefore necessary to explore biomarkers to determine the extent of lung lesions and disease severity. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the usefulness of CRP levels in the early stage of COVID-19 and to correlate them with lung lesions and severe presentation. METHODS: Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were selected at the Fever Unit in two regions of Guizhou, China. On admission CRP levels were collected, and the diameter of the largest lung lesion was measured in the most severe lung lesion by lung CT scan. Differences in the diameter and CRP levels were compared in the following groups of patients: mild group, moderate group, severe group, and critical group. RESULT: CRP levels and the diameter of the largest lung lesion in the moderate group were higher than those in the mild group (Mann-Whitney test=-2.647, -2.171, PË0.05), those in the severe group were higher than those in the moderate group (Mann-Whitney test=0.693, -2.177, PË0.05), and those in the critical group were higher than those in the severe group (Mann-Whitney test=-0.068, -1.549, PË0.05). The difference was statistically significant. CRP levels were positively correlated with the diameter of lung lesion and severe presentation (correlation coefficient=0.873, 0.734, PË0.001). CONCLUSION: In the early stage of COVID-19 CRP levels were positively correlated with lung lesions and could reflect disease severity.","Wang, L",Med Mal Infect,,12

444027,Wedelolactone Mitigates Parkinsonism Via Alleviating Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction Through NRF2/SKN-1,2020,"Working with data in table form is usually considered a preparatory and tedious step in the sensemaking pipeline; a way of getting the data ready for more sophisticated visualization and analytical tools. But for many people, spreadsheets -- the quintessential table tool -- remain a critical part of their information ecosystem, allowing them to interact with their data in ways that are hidden or abstracted in more complex tools. This is particularly true for data workers: people who work with data as part of their job but do not identify as professional analysts or data scientists. We report on a qualitative study of how these workers interact with and reason about their data. Our findings show that data tables serve a broader purpose beyond data cleanup at the initial stage of a linear analytic flow: users want to see and""get their hands on""the underlying data throughout the analytics process, reshaping and augmenting it to support sensemaking. They reorganize, mark up, layer on levels of detail, and spawn alternatives within the context of the base data. These direct interactions and human-readable table representations form a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what the data mean and what they can do with it. We argue that interactive tables are an important visualization idiom in their own right; that the direct data interaction they afford offers a fertile design space for visual analytics; and that sense making can be enriched by more flexible human-data interaction than is currently supported in visual analytics tools.","Bartram, Lyn; Correll, Michael; Tory, Melanie",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15005v1.pdf,12

It causes many changes in hemogram parameters. Low albumin levels are associated with mortality risk in hospitalized patients. The aim of the present study is to reveal the place of neutrophil count to albumin ratio in predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: 144 patients, 65 females and 79 males, were included in the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 was the non-severe group (n:85), and Group 2 was severe (n:59). Demographic data, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts, albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were recorded. Neutrophil count to albumin ratio (NAR) was calculated by dividing the absolute neutrophil counts by the albumin levels. The NAR and levels of the two groups were then compared. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in gender and platelet count (201 vs. 211 K/mL) between the groups (p>0,05). Ages (62.0 ± 14.3 vs 68.6 ± 12.2 years), albumin (33.1 vs 29.9 gr/L), CRP (33 vs 113 mg/l), neutrophil count (4 vs 7.24 K/mL), WBC counts (6.70 vs 8.50 K/mL), NAR values (113.5 vs 267.2) and number of Death (5 vs 33) were found to be statistically higher (p <0.001) in Group 2 than in Group 1. The NAR value of 201.5 showed mortality in all patients with COVID-19 to have 71.1% sensitivity and 71.7% specificity (AUC:0.736, 95% CI: 0.641-0.832, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The present study showed that NAR levels can be a cheap and simple marker for predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Varim, Ceyhun; Yaylaci, Selcuk; Demirci, Taner; Kaya, Tezcan; Nalbant, Ahmet; Dheir, Hamad; Senocak, Didar; Kurt, Rumeysa; Cengiz, Hasret; Karacaer, Cengiz",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),,12

As we begin to emerge from the crisis, we will need to manage the backlog of nonemergency neurosurgical patients whose treatment has been delayed and remain responsive to further possible surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections. METHODS: In the present study, we aimed to identify the core themes and challenges that will limit resumption of a normal neurosurgical service after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to provide pragmatic advice and solutions that could be of utility to clinicians seeking to resume nonemergency neurosurgical care. We reviewed the relevant international policies, a wide range of journalistic and media sources, and expert opinion documents to address the stated aims. RESULTS: We have presented and discussed a range of factors that could become potential barriers to resuming full elective neurosurgical provision and important steps that must be completed to achieve pre-SARS-CoV-2 surgical capacity. We also explored how these challenges can be overcome and outlined the key requirements for a successful neurosurgical exit strategy from the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The performance of nonemergency neurosurgery can start once minimum criteria have been fulfilled: 1) a structured prioritization of surgical cases; 2) virus infection incidence decreased sufficiently to release previously diverted healthcare resources; 3) adequate safety criteria met for patients and staff, including sufficient personal protective equipment and robust testing availability; and 4) maintenance of systems for rapid communication at organizational and individual levels.","Hill, Ciaran S; Muirhead, William R; Vakharia, Vejay N; Marcus, Hani J; Choi, David",World Neurosurg,,12
452745,Effects of Interregional Travels and Vaccination in Infection Spreads Simulated by Lattice of SEIRS Circuits,2021-04-20,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus termed SARS-CoV-2, has spread quickly worldwide. Convalescent plasma (CP) obtained from patients following recovery from COVID-19 infection and development of antibodies against the virus is an attractive option for either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment, since antibodies may have direct or indirect antiviral activities and immunotherapy has proven effective in principle and in many clinical reports. OBJECTIVE: We seek to characterize the latest advances and evidence in the use of CP for COVID-19 through a systematic review and quantitative analysis, identify knowledge gaps in this setting, and offer recommendations and directives for future research. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were continuously searched for studies assessing the use of CP for COVID-19, including clinical studies, commentaries, reviews, guidelines or protocols, and in vitro testing of CP antibodies. The screening process and data extraction were performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Quality appraisal of all clinical studies was conducted using a universal tool independent of study designs. A meta-analysis of case-control and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Substantial literature has been published covering various aspects of CP therapy for COVID-19. Of the references included in this review, a total of 243 eligible studies including 64 clinical studies, 79 commentary articles, 46 reviews, 19 guidance and protocols, and 35 in vitro testing of CP antibodies matched the criteria. Positive results have been mostly observed so far when using CP for the treatment of COVID-19. There were remarkable heterogeneities in the CP therapy with respect to patient demographics, donor antibody titers, and time and dose of CP administration. The studies assessing the safety of CP treatment reported low incidence of adverse events. Most clinical studies, in particular case reports and case series, had poor quality. Only 1 RCT was of high quality. Randomized and nonrandomized data were found in 2 and 11 studies, respectively, and were included for meta-analysis, suggesting that CP could reduce mortality and increase viral clearance. Despite promising pilot studies, the benefits of CP treatment can only be clearly established through carefully designed RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: There is developing support for CP therapy, particularly for patients who are critically ill or mechanically ventilated and resistant to antivirals and supportive care. These studies provide important lessons that should inform the planning of well-designed RCTs to generate more robust knowledge for the efficacy of CP in patients with COVID-19. Future research is necessary to fill the knowledge gap regarding prevention and treatment for patients with COVID-19 with CP while other therapeutics are being developed.","Peng, Henry T; Rhind, Shawn G; Beckett, Andrew",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,12

Utilizing mRNA display, we identified a set of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins and characterized the structures of nAbs that recognized epitopes in the S1 subunit of the S glycoprotein. These structural studies revealed distinct binding modes for several antibodies, including targeting of rare cryptic epitopes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S that interacts with angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate infection, as well as the S1 subdomain 1. A potent ACE2-blocking nAb was further engineered to sustain binding to S RBD with the E484K and L452R substitutions found in multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. We demonstrate that mRNA display is a promising approach for the rapid identification of nAbs that can be used in combination to combat emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Tanaka, Shiho; Olson, C.

459047,Broad phenotypic alterations and potential dysfunction of lymphocytes in individuals clinically recovered from COVID-19,2021,"Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a mechanism by which the pathogenesis of certain viral infections is enhanced in the presence of sub-neutralizing or cross-reactive non-neutralizing antiviral antibodies. In vitro modelling of ADE has attributed enhanced pathogenesis to FcÎ³ receptor (FcÎ³R)-mediated viral entry, rather than canonical viral receptor-mediated entry. However, the putative FcÎ³R-dependent mechanisms of ADE overlap with the role of these receptors in mediating antiviral protection in various viral infections, necessitating a detailed understanding of how this diverse family of receptors functions in protection and pathogenesis. Here, we discuss the diversity of immune responses mediated upon FcÎ³R engagement and review the available experimental evidence supporting the role of FcÎ³Rs in antiviral protection and pathogenesis through ADE. We explore FcÎ³R engagement in the context of a range of different viral infections, including dengue virus and SARS-CoV, and consider ADE in the context of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Bournazos, Stylianos; Gupta, Aaron; Ravetch, Jeffrey V",Nat Rev Immunol,,12
459313,Antimicrobial surfaces: A need for stewardship?,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The evolution and clinical significance of abnormal liver chemistries and the impact of hepatitis B infection on outcome in patients with COVID-19 is not well characterized. This study aimed to explore these issues. METHODS: This large retrospective cohort study included 2073 patients with COVID-19 having definite outcomes in Wuhan, China. Longitudinal liver function tests were conducted and determined their associated factors and death risk by multivariate regression analyses. A prognostic nomogram was formulated to predict the survival of patients with COVID-19. The characteristics of liver abnormalities and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 with and without hepatitis B were compared after 1:3 propensity score matching. RESULTS: Of the 2073 patients, 1282 (61.8%) had abnormal liver chemistries during hospitalization, and 297 (14.3%) had a liver injury. The mean levels of AST and D-Bil increased early after symptom onset in deceased patients and showed disparity compared with that in discharged patients throughout the clinical course of the disease. Abnormal admission AST (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.39, 95%CI: 1.04-1.86, P=0.027) and D-Bil (adjusted HR: 1.66, 95%CI: 1.22-2.26, P=0.001) levels were independent risk factors for mortality due to COVID-19. A nomogram was established based on the results of multivariate analysis and showed sufficient discriminatory power and good consistency between the prediction and the observation. HBV infection in patients did not increase the risk of COVID-19-associated poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal AST and D-Bil levels at admission were independent predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Therefore, monitoring liver chemistries, especially AST and D-Bil levels, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, is necessary.","Ding, Ze-Yang; Li, Gan-Xun; Chen, Lin; Shu, Chang; Song, Jia; Wang, Wei; Wang, Yu-Wei; Chen, Qian; Jin, Guan-Nan; Liu, Tong-Tong; Liang, Jun-Nan; Zhu, Peng; Zhu, Wei; Li, Yong; Zhang, Bin-Hao; Feng, Huan; Zhang, Wan-Guang; Yin, Zhen-Yu; Yu, Wen-Kui; Yang, Yang; Zhang, Hua-Qiu; Tang, Zhou-Ping; Wang, Hui; Hu, Jun-Bo; Liu, Ji-Hong; Yin, Ping; Chen, Xiao-Ping; Zhang, Bixiang",J. hepatol,,12

The SSDC outreach program is split into two parts: one theoretical, in which relevant topic are presented and explained, and one practical, consisting of hands-on activities aimed to replicate scientific analysis of real space data. The impact of the program on students' attitude is then evaluated by means of questionnaires specifically designed to gather information on the students' educational background, the level of engagement triggered by the proposed activities, their relevance to school-based activities, and the perceived ease of understanding of the covered topics. As reported in this paper, the analysis of the answers clearly shows that students greatly appreciated this outreach project, supporting its possible expansion and development, even articulated in a more complex pedagogical plan, as already done for one school in a pilot case. Therefore, we plan to expand these activities in the next future both by including new topics (e.g., cosmology, stellar physics), and by proposing new more articulated teaching pathways inclusive of on-site activities in the classroom.","Zinzi, Angelo; Pittori, Carlotta; Tagliamonte, Rosa; Nichelli, Elisa",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15976v1.pdf,12

461056,Dysregulation of type I interferon responses in COVID-19,2020,"Digital health and telehealth connectivity have become important aspects of clinical care. Connected devices, including continuous glucose monitors and automated insulin delivery systems for diabetes, are being used increasingly to support personalized clinical decisions based on automatically collected data. Furthermore, the development, demand, and coverage for telehealth have all recently expanded, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical care, and especially diabetes care, are therefore becoming more digital through the use of both connected digital health devices and telehealth communication. It has therefore become necessary to integrate digital data into the electronic health record and maintain personal data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Connected digital monitoring combined with telehealth communication is known as virtual health. For this virtual care paradigm to be successful, patients must have proper skills, training, and equipment. We propose that along with the five current vital signs of blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, temperature, and pain, at this time, digital connectivity should be considered as the sixth vital sign. In this article, we present a scale to assess digital connectivity.","Klonoff, David C; Shang, Trisha; Zhang, Jennifer Y; Cengiz, Eda; Mehta, Chhavi; Kerr, David",J Diabetes Sci Technol,,12

Hypobaric hypoxia altered redox homeostasis and impaired calcium ion handling in skeletal muscles. Dysregulated Ca2+ homeostasis and activated calpain is the prime stressor in high altitude hypoxia while the reason for subsequent abnormal release of pathological Ca2+ into cytoplasm is largely unexplored. The present study identified the redox remodeling in the Ca2+ release channel, Ryanodine Receptor (RyR1) owing to its hypernitrosylation state in skeletal muscles in chronic hypobaric hypoxia exposed rats. RyR1-hypernitrosylation decreases the binding of FKBP12/calstabin-1 and other complexes from the channel, causing ""leakiness"" in RyR1 ion-channel. A strong RyR1 stabilizer, S107 enhanced binding affinity of FKBP12 with hypernitrosylated RyR1, reduced Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak and improved muscle strength and function under chronic hypoxia. Administration of S107 inhibited the skeletal muscle damage, maintained ultrastructure of sarcomere and sarcolemmal integrity. Histological analysis proved the increase in cross-sectional area of myofibers. Further, the number of apoptotic cells was also reduced by S107 treatment. Conclusively, we proposed that the redox remodeling of RyR1 (hypernitrosylated-RyR1) might be responsible for dysregulated Ca2+ homeostasis which consequently impaired muscle strength and function in response to chronic hypoxic stress. Reduced SR Ca2+ leak and enhanced binding affinity of FKBP12 may provide a novel therapeutic avenue in ameliorating skeletal muscle atrophy at high altitude.","Agrawal, Akanksha; Rathor, Richa; Kumar, Ravi; Suryakumar, Geetha; Singh, Som Nath; Kumar, Bhuvnesh",Free radic. biol. med,,12

METHODS: Participants were recruited to attend the virtual information session over a 2-week period via social media and communication with medical school radiology interest groups. Attendees were able to submit questions or topics of interest prior to the session. The virtual information session was hosted by trainees and faculty from a radiology residency. Data regarding the demographics of the attendees and the efficacy of the session were obtained through interactive live polling during the virtual session and a voluntary anonymous postsession survey. RESULTS: A total of 171 attendees participated in the virtual information session. Of the attendees, 42% learned about the session from Twitter and 72% were fourth-year medical students applying for residency. Among topics addressed during the session, attendees indicated that they were most interested in learning about ""Application strategies during COVID-19"" during an in-session poll. On the post-session survey, 96% of attendees reported being more knowledgeable about the residency program culture and the breadth of research and educational opportunities. CONCLUSION: Given the virtual nature of the 2020-2021 residency application cycle, utilization of web-based platforms for recruitment will be essential. Virtual information sessions can be effective at providing insight into aspects of a residency program that are typically gained during the in-person interview experience.","Tanaka, Mari E; Brideau, Holly R; An, Thomas J; McLoud, Theresa C; Little, Brent P; Kelly, Hillary R",Curr. probl. diagn. radiol,,12

Recent advances in experimental models, methodology, and our understanding of disease processes at the molecular and cellular levels reveal opioid-HIV interactions with increasing clarity. However, despite the substantial new insight, the unique impact of opioids on the severity, progression, and prognosis of neuroHIV and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are not fully understood. In this review, we explore, in detail, what is currently known about mechanisms underlying opioid interactions with HIV, with emphasis on individual HIV-1-expressed gene products at the molecular, cellular and systems levels. Furthermore, we review preclinical and clinical studies with a focus on key considerations when addressing questions of whether opioid-HIV interactive pathogenesis results in unique structural or functional deficits not seen with either disease alone. These considerations include, understanding the combined consequences of HIV-1 genetic variants, host variants, and µ-opioid receptor (MOR) and HIV chemokine co-receptor interactions on the comorbidity. Lastly, we present topics that need to be considered in the future to better understand the unique contributions of opioids to the pathophysiology of neuroHIV.

472281,"α,α'-C-H Bond Difunctionalization of Unprotected Alicyclic Amines",2021,"Aerosols are readily transported on airstreams through building sanitary plumbing and sewer systems, and those containing microbial pathogens (known as bioaerosols) are recognized as contributors to infection spread within buildings. When a defect occurs in the sanitary plumbing system that affects the system integrity, a cross-transmission route is created that can enable the emission of bioaerosols from the system into the building. These emission occurrences are characterized as short-burst events (typically <1 min in duration) which make them difficult to detect and predict. The characterization of these emission events is the focus of this research. Two methods were used to characterize bioaerosol emission events in a full-scale test rig: (a) an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) for particle size distribution and concentrations; and (b) a slit-to-agar sampler to enumerate the ingress of a viable tracer microorganism (Pseudomonas putida). The APS data confirmed that most particles (>99.5%) were <5 µm and were therefore considered aerosols. Particles generated within the sanitary plumbing system as a result of a toilet flush leads to emissions into the building during system defect conditions with an equivalence of someone talking loudly for over 6 and a half minutes. There were no particles detected of a size >11 µm anywhere in the system. Particle count was influenced by toilet flush volume, but it was not possible to determine if there was any direct influence from airflow rate since both particle and biological data showed no correlation with upward airflow rates and velocities. Typical emissions resulting from a 6 L toilet flush were in the range of 280-400 particles per second at a concentration of typically 9-12 number per cm3 and a total particle count in the region of 3000 to 4000 particles, whereas the peak emissions from a 1.2 L toilet flush were 60-80 particles per second at a concentration of 2.4-3 number per cm3 and a total particle count in the region of 886 to 1045 particles. The reduction in particles is in direct proportion to the reduction in toilet flush volume. The slit-to-agar sampler was able to provide viable time course CFU data and confirmed the origin of the particles to be the tracer microorganism flushed into the system. The time course data also have characteristics consistent with the unsteady nature of a toilet flush.","Gormley, Michael; Aspray, Thomas J; Kelly, David A",Indoor air,,12

477336,Potential role of viral metagenomics as a surveillance tool for the early detection of emerging novel pathogens,2020,"This article used supplementary information sources and relied on direct data importation and matching of patient identifiers for data on hospitalisation status, the occurrence of death, race/ethnicity, and presence of underlying medical conditions. The highest rates of cases, hospitalisations, and deaths were concentrated in communities of color, high poverty areas, and among persons aged 75 years or with underlying conditions. The crude fatality rate was 9.2% overall and 32.1% among hospitalised patients. Using these data to prevent additional infections among NYC residents during subsequent waves of the pandemic, particularly among those at highest risk for hospitalisation and death, is critical. Mitigating COVID-19 transmission among vulnerable groups at high risk for hospitalisation and death is an urgent priority. Similar to NYC, other jurisdictions might find the use of supplementary information sources valuable in their efforts to prevent COVID-19 infections. This report describes cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among NYC residents diagnosed during 29 February 29 to 1 June, 2020, that were reported to DOHMH. DOHMH began COVID-19 surveillance in January 2020 when testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was limited by strict testing criteria because of limited test availability only through CDC. The NYC and New York State public health laboratories began testing hospitalised patients at the end of February and early March. DOHMH encouraged patients with mild symptoms to remain at home rather than seek health care because of shortages of personal protective equipment and laboratory tests at hospitals and clinics. Commercial laboratories began testing for SARS-CoV-2 in mid to late March. During 29 February 29 to 15 March, patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were interviewed by DOHMH, and close contacts were identified for monitoring. The rapid rise in laboratory-confirmed cases (cases) quickly made interviewing all patients, as well as contact tracing, unsustainable. Subsequent case investigations first included medical chart review for patients who were hospitalised or who had died, but then progressed to chart review only for patients who had died, and then finally only for deaths in patients aged <65 years. Mitigating COVID-19 transmission among vulnerable groups at high risk for hospitalisation and death is an urgent priority.","Thompson, C.

478159,Sequencing Therapies for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma,2020,"BACKGROUND: In Aotearoa/New Zealand, the first nation-wide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown occurred from March 23, 2020 to May 13, 2020, requiring most people to stay at home. Health services had to suddenly change how they delivered healthcare and some services were limited or postponed. This study investigated access to healthcare during this lockdown period, whether patients delayed seeking healthcare and reasons for these delays, focusing on the accessibility of primary care services. METHODS: Adults (aged 18 years or older) who had contact with primary care services were invited through social media and email lists to participate in an online survey (n = 1010) and 38 people were recruited for in-depth interviews. We thematically analysed qualitative data from the survey and interviews, reported alongside relevant descriptive survey results. RESULTS: More than half (55%) of survey respondents delayed seeking healthcare during lockdown. Factors at a national or health system-level that could influence delay were changing public service messages, an excessive focus on COVID-19 and urgent issues, and poor service integration. Influential factors at a primary care-level were communication and outreach, use of technology, gatekeeping, staff manner and the safety of the clinical practice environment. Factors that influenced patients' individual decisions to seek healthcare were the ability to self-manage and self-triage, consciousness of perceived pressure on health services and fear of infection. CONCLUSION: In future pandemic lockdowns or crises, appropriate access to primary care services can be improved by unambiguous national messages and better integration of services. Primary care practices should adopt rapid proactive outreach to patients, fostering a calm but safe clinical practice environment. More support for patients to self-manage and self-triage appropriately could benefit over-burdened health systems during lockdowns and as part of business as usual in less extraordinary times.","Imlach, Fiona; McKinlay, Eileen; Kennedy, Jonathan; Pledger, Megan; Middleton, Lesley; Cumming, Jacqueline; McBride-Henry, Karen",Int. j. health policy manag,,12

We propose and prove a new theorem for a causal feature selection method for time series data, robust to latent confounders, which we subsequently apply on Covid-19 case numbers. We present findings about the spread of the virus in Germany and the causal impact of restriction measures, discussing the role of various policies in containing the spread. Since our results are based on rather limited target time series (only the numbers of reported cases), care should be exercised in interpreting them. However, it is encouraging that already such limited data seems to contain causal signals. This suggests that as more data becomes available, our causal approach may contribute towards meaningful causal analysis of political interventions on the development of Covid-19, and thus also towards the development of rational and data-driven methodologies for choosing interventions.","Mastakouri, Atalanti A.; Scholkopf, Bernhard",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.11896v2.pdf,12

This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study, with a quantitative approach, carried out in eight LTCF in the Metropolitan Region of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, with a population of 267 elderly people, between the months of February and December 2018. The Elderly Health Handbook was used to collect data on sociodemographic, health and risk factors. The Pearson's Chi-square test and odds ratio were used for the analysis. A higher frequency of low weight was observed in elderly people with cognitive impairment (24.6%), and overweight in those hypertensive (23.3%) and diabetics (12.9%). BMI was associated with the age group of 80 years or over, hypertension and diabetes (p = 0.013; p < 0.001; p = 0.001). Hypertensive elderly people were more likely to have low weight when compared to non-hypertensive individuals (RC = 3.6; 95% CI 1.5-8.6). The institutionalized elderly individuals present health conditions that may contribute to the occurrence of adverse outcomes in case of infection by Covid-19. The importance of protective measures for this population must be reinforced, in view of the devastating action of this disease in these institutions.","Araújo, Mayara Priscilla Dantas; Nunes, Vilani Medeiros de Araújo; Costa, Larissa de Albuquerque; Souza, Talita Araujo de; Torres, Gilson de Vasconcelos; Nobre, Thaiza Teixeira Xavier",PLoS One,,12

However, a meta-analysis is needed to attain more precise prevalence estimates due to between-study variability. Thus, we performed a rapid review and meta-analysis of posttraumatic stress and general psychological stress symptoms during COVID-19. Electronic searches were conducted up to May 26th, 2020 using key terms: mental illness and COVID-19. A total of k = 14 non-overlapping studies were identified for inclusion. Random effects meta-analyses indicated that the pooled prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms and psychological stress in the general population was 23.88% and 24.84%, respectively. In both meta-analyses, the prevalence of stress symptoms was higher in unpublished compared to peer-reviewed studies. Overall, nearly one-in-four adults experienced significant stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological resources and services must be allocated to help address the mental health burden of COVID-19.

484450,MAIT cell activation augments adenovirus vector vaccine immunogenicity,2021,"BACKGROUND: Data on patients with invasive Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG) infections is limited, as it's been considered commensal bacteria in the human microbiota. We conducted an analysis of SAG infections to assist clinicians in understanding their burden and clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective study of medical records, identifying invasive SAG bacteria of sterile-site isolates that were managed from May 2015 to April 2017, at a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Demographic data, clinical presentation, site of infection, antibiotic use, and outcome were recorded and analyzed to identify factors associated with poor outcome and/or polymicrobial growth. RESULTS: We identified 105 cases of SAG infections in adults, with 52% of the patients being male and the mean age of 52.4 years with comorbidities occurring in more than half of the cases such as diabetes (38%) and malignancy (15%). Overall mortality was 6%, and it was statistically associated with age older than 65 years, polymicrobial growth and a history of malignancy. The infection frequencies were skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI; 55%), intra-abdominal infections (24%), bacteremia (14%), genitourinary infections (8.5%), and pleuropulmonary infections (5%). Abscesses accounted for 68% of cases. Polymicrobial infection (46%) with Enterobacteriaceae and Gram-negative anaerobes coincided with SAG infection. Polymicrobial growth was significantly associated with abscess formation, intra-abdominal source of infections, and poor outcome. In addition, death in patients with SAG was statistically associated with patients older than 65 years of age and those with history of cancer or transplant. CONCLUSION: SSTIs and intra-abdominal infections are the most common clinical presentations in our cohort. Bacteremia was uncommon; however, the prognosis is less favorable. Overall susceptibility to penicillin was 91%, therefore ß-lactam antibiotics are the drug of choice and additional coverage for anaerobic and gram-negative bacteria should be considered for intra-abdominal collection and solid or organ abscesses.","Al Majid, F; Aldrees, A; Barry, M; Binkhamis, K; Allam, A; Almohaya, A",,,12

489809,Preparing for the unseen threat of infectious disease,2020,"The analogy of South Africa as an ailing ""organism"" afflicted by chronic socio-economic inequality is apt as it captures the nation's manifest endemic abrasions and frailties, especially as it relates to the lived experience of its most vulnerable citizens (the precariat). COVID-19 has accentuated the plight of the poor, yet political rhetoric professes that the pandemic does not discriminate. In this article I offer an analysis of the intricate relationship between politics, economics, and education in the South African context. I argue that these are indeed complexly connected social ""phenomena"" that have particular variant manifestations and implications for South African citizens. While I recognise that health is also implicated in this matrix, it is beyond the scope of this article to examine this crucial social provision in any detail. I contend that in attempting to understand how COVID-19 impacts South African society, it is important to firstly analyse the prevailing (pre-COVID) status quo, especially as it relates to socio-economic inequality, as the effects of the pandemic impact the lived experience of people on the indigent-affluent continuum in starkly distinct ways. The pandemic has brought into sharp purview the accentuated nature of human adversity in the South African context and the social justice peculiarities plaguing South African society. Methodologically, I attempt a Foucauldian analysis of the contemporary political-economy-education matrix to reveal how fundamental neoliberal tenets have fashioned South African society and its education system into a dualism in which poverty and affluence co-exist. I attempt to move beyond constructions of deprivation, strife and adversity to reflect on resistance and the resilience (technologies of the self) that human beings summon in the face of crisis. Secondly, I examine the impact of the pandemic at localised school level to reveal its material effects on poor schools.","Maistry, Suriamurthee",Education as Change,,12

METHODS: This research employed a qualitative-phenomenological approach. It was conducted at the COVID centres of the Hail region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Both purposive and snowball sampling were used, resulting in 15 participants. However, saturation was identified in the 11th participant. Interviews were conducted online through a Zoom platform, with at least 50 minutes per participant. Thematic analysis was used in analysing the data. RESULTS: The nurses recorded four themes and three subthemes based on one-on-one interviews. These themes included (1) Labelling nurses as ""COVID Nurses,"" with a subtheme of frustration, (2) ""Fear of the unknown,"" with a subtheme of ""uncertainties,"" (3) Nurses' need for support, and (4) the Love for the profession, with a subtheme of ""nurses' worth."" CONCLUSION: Nurses who cared for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 experienced stigma. They were labelled ""COVID Nurses."" They experienced fear of the unknown and uncertainties and felt they needed support. Despite these experiences, the nurses felt fulfilled as they have a high regard for their profession. The experiences of these nurses call for intervention to help them before, during, and after any health-related crisis.

The first is to incorporate the principles and values of social justice, reciprocity and solidarity in the subject 'Statistics Applied to Business' in the bachelor's degree in Business Administration and Management at the University of the Basque Country. The second objective addresses how to apply active methodologies in the teaching of economics and business from a competency-based approach in order to investigate its impact. The third one, on the other hand, tries to explore how to provide students with active distance learning tools to improve and guarantee the quality of the teaching-learning process. The results of the experience demonstrate the potential of technical subjects for the development of transversal competencies and the capacity of students to design and solve complex problems with creativity and knowledge of social and labour realities. Likewise, greater motivation, better knowledge acquisition and appropriation of the work by the students are also detected. Finally, this article shows the potential of methodologies that involve the combined responsibility of students and teachers in the generation of knowledge that favours a professional development that is permeable and sensitive to the changes occurring in the social and labour world.","Arcos-Alonso, Asier Arcos Alonso Ander",Cypriot Journal of Educational Sciences,,12

In Hajj 2019, a cross-sectional survey was undertaken in Mina, Makkah, Saudi Arabia, of domestic Saudi pilgrims aged &#8805;18 years by using a self-administered Arabic questionnaire that captured data on pilgrims' socio-demographics, hand hygiene knowledge, and reported practices of hand cleaning following certain actions. A total of 348 respondents aged 18 to 63 (median 32) years completed the survey, of whom 200 (57.5%) were female. The mean (±standard deviation (SD)) hand hygiene knowledge score was 6.7 (±SD 1.9). Two hundred and seventy one (77.9%) and 286 (82.2%) of respondents correctly identified that hand hygiene can prevent respiratory and gastrointestinal infections respectively, but 146 (42%) were not aware that it prevents hand-foot-mouth disease. Eighty-eight (25.3%) respondents erroneously reported that hand hygiene prevents HIV. Washing hands with water and soap was the most preferred method practiced before a meal (67.5% (235/348)), after a meal (80.2% (279/348)), after toilet action (81.6% (284/348)), when hands were visibly soiled (86.2% (300/348)), and after waste disposal (61.5% (214/348)).

494568,Lack of AI-based method for pneumocystis pneumonia classification in radiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To describe patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIRD) who had COVID-19 disease; to compare patients who required hospital admission with those who did not and assess risk factors for hospital admission related to COVID-19. METHODS: An observational longitudinal study was conducted during the pandemic peak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (1 March 2020 to 24 April). All patients attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain with a medical diagnosis of AIRD and with symptomatic COVID-19 were included. The main outcome was hospital admission related to COVID-19. The covariates were sociodemographic, clinical and treatments. We ran a multivariable logistic regression model to assess risk factors for the hospital admission. RESULTS: The study population included 123 patients with AIRD and COVID-19. Of these, 54 patients required hospital admission related to COVID-19. The mean age on admission was 69.7 (15.7) years, and the median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 5 (3-10) days. The median length of stay was 9 (6-14) days. A total of 12 patients died (22%) during admission. Compared with outpatients, the factors independently associated with hospital admission were older age (OR: 1.08; p=0.00) and autoimmune systemic condition (vs chronic inflammatory arthritis) (OR: 3.55; p=0.01). No statistically significant findings for exposure to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were found in the final model. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that age and having a systemic autoimmune condition increased the risk of hospital admission, whereas disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were not associated with hospital admission.","Freites Nuñez, Dalifer D; Leon, Leticia; Mucientes, Arkaitz; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Luis; Font Urgelles, Judit; Madrid García, Alfredo; Colomer, Jose I; Jover, Juan A; Fernandez-Gutierrez, Benjamín; Abasolo, Lydia",Ann Rheum Dis,,12
495403,Understanding multivariate brain activity: Evaluating the effect of voxelwise noise correlations on population codes in functional magnetic resonance imaging,2020,"BACKGROUND: Community pharmacists play a pivotal role in healthcare worldwide. Their role became more critical during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate the community pharmacists' preparedness and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and how efficiently they were prepared to contain and prevent the spread of infection. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Jordan through social media platforms. A scoring system was developed to measure their level of adherence to the preventive measures of the global infection. RESULTS: The total included responses were 800. Around 44% of the pharmacists reported spending less than 15 minutes/day reading about COVID-19 updates. Although more than half of them were reviewing official sites, 73% of them were also retrieving information through non-official channels. Additionally, almost 35% of them were directly contacting customers without physical barriers, 81% reported encountering infected customers, and 12% wore the same facial masks for more than a day. Moreover, 58% of the pharmacies reported the absence of door signs requesting infected customers to declare the infection, 43% of the pharmacies were not limiting the number of simultaneous customers, and 70% were not measuring customers' temperatures prior to entry. Collectively, the mean total score of applied protective measures was 10.12 ± 2.77 (out of 17). CONCLUSION: The level of preparedness of the community pharmacies in these three Middle Eastern countries was not adequate for facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Health authorities in these countries should closely monitor their adherence to the protective guidelines.","Itani, Rania; Karout, Samar; Khojah, Hani M J; Jaffal, Fatima; Abbas, Fatima; Awad, Reem; Karout, Lina; Abu-Farha, Rana; Kassab, Mohamad B; Mukattash, Tareq L",Int J Clin Pract,,12

Patients and methods: A serosurvey was conducted in 9782 subjects from the two French regions with the highest incidence of COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic and coupled with surveillance data. Results: IHR and IFR were 2.7% and 0.49% overall. Both were higher in men and increased exponentially with age. The relative risks of hospitalization and death were 2.1 (95% CI: 1.9-2.3) and 3.8 (2.4-4.2) per 10-year increase, meaning that IHR and IFR approximately doubled every 10 and 5 years, respectively. They were dramatically high in the very elderly (80-90 years: IHR: 26%, IFR: 9.2%), and also substantial in younger adults (40-50 years: IHR: 0.98%, IFR: 0.042%). Conclusions: These findings support the need for comprehensive preventive measures to help reduce the spread of the virus, even in young or middle-aged adults.","Lapidus, Nathanael; Paireau, Juliette; Levy-Bruhl, Daniel; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Severi, Gianluca; Touvier, Mathilde; Zins, Marie; Cauchemez, Simon; Carrat, Fabrice",,,12

500294,Complexities and pitfalls in analyzing and interpreting mitochondrial DNA content in human cancer,2020,"Since Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in December 2019, the disease has rapidly evolved into a pandemic that threatens societies around the world. As soon as the causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified and its genome sequence determined, a laboratory diagnosis based on nucleic acid amplification technologies was quickly established and has played essential roles in the confirmation of a clinical diagnosis. Serological testing for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is becoming available for complementary diagnosis, identification of convalescent plasma, and epidemiologic studies. Additional laboratory biochemical tests, including monitoring the change in blood cells, blood gas, coagulation, liver function, cardiac markers, and inflammatory responses such as cytokine levels in plasma, are also critical in combating COVID-19. Nevertheless, with overwhelming numbers of patients and potentially large numbers of asymptomatic cases, clinical laboratories encounter enormous challenges in diagnostic approaches that can rapidly and accurately identify infected persons. Strategies that can effectively detect disease progression in order to stratify patients for appropriate care, and that can thereby prevent exacerbation of the disease, are urgently needed. This review discusses the laboratory's role and challenges in combating COVID-19.","Fang, Bingliang; Meng, Qing H",Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci,,12

(1) It contains a brief historical and comparative overview of selected pandemics, particularly in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) It provides a simple original model which could be used to prioritize the admission of COVID-19 sufferers to hospital (taking into account available hospital capacity) and (3) it specifies a second model to evaluate desired social choices involving the trade-off between the severity of social restrictions (taking into account their impact on the incidence of COVID-19) and the level of economic activity. Bergson-type welfare functions are utilized in the second model. It also critically examines the proposition that the isolation (lockdown) of social groups is a desirable method of limiting the incidence of COVID-19. This leads onto the consideration of the extent to which personal freedom of choice (liberty) ought to be restricted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A brief outline follows illustrating the factors that are likely to hinder economic recovery from COVID-19.

Methods: We evaluated a nationwide administrative database of all hospitalized patients with main diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke with/without diagnosis of Covid-19 who were hospitalized during the time period from January 16th to May 15th, 2020. Data from a total of 1463 hospitals in Germany were included. We compared case numbers, treatment characteristics (intravenous thrombolysis, IVT; mechanical thrombectomy, MT; treated on an intensive care unit, stroke unit or regular ward) and in-hospital mortality of AIS with and without concurrent diagnosis of Covid-19. Results: From a total of 30,864 hospitalized Covid-19 patients during the evaluation period in Germany, we identified a subgroup of 213 patients with primary diagnosis of AIS. Compared to the 68,700 AIS patients without Covid-19, this subgroup showed a similar rate of IVT (16.4% vs. 16.5%, p = 0.985) but a significantly lower rate of MT (3.8% vs. 7.9%, p = 0.017). In-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with AIS and concurrent Covid-19 compared to non-infected AIS patients (22.5% vs. 7.8%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: These nationwide data point out differences in mortality and medical treatment regime between AIS patients with and without concurrent Covid-19. Since the pandemic is still ongoing, these data draw attention to AIS as a less frequent but often fatal comorbidity in Covid-19 patients.","Richter, Daniel; Krogias, Christos; Eyding, Jens; Bartig, Dirk; Grau, Armin; Weber, Ralph",Neurol Res Pract,,12

METHODS: Between March and July 2020, when C-AMs were not available because of the COVID-19 pandemic, 28 corneal ulcers underwent FD-AM overlay transplantation and were retrospectively compared with 22 corneal ulcers treated with C-AM during the same period in 2018. All patients had at least 3 months of follow-up, and those who underwent combined surgeries were excluded. Ulcers were assessed at baseline and then at 72 hours, 1 month, and 3 months. Population demographics, follow-up time, ulcer etiologies, epithelial defect size, ulcer depth, and complications were also recorded. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics and clinical features of both groups were comparable. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of overlay AM transplantations (P = 0.52) or early detachments (P = 0.57). At 3 months, the corneal healing rate was almost the same in both groups (89% and 91% for FD-AM and C-AM, respectively; P = 0.87). Complications were equally uncommon (11% and 9%, respectively; P = 0.92). In logistic regression, the type of the membrane did not influence corneal healing at 1 month (P = 0.42) or 3 months (P = 0.99), regardless of the depth of the ulcer. However, whatever the type of AM used, the deeper the ulcer was, the less likely it was to heal at 3 months (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that provides positive insight into the effectiveness of FD-AM compared with C-AM when used as overlay transplantation for treating corneal ulcers.","Memmi, Benjamin; Leveziel, Loïc; Knoeri, Juliette; Leclère, Amélie; Ribes, Olivier; Despiaux, Marie-Claire; Bouheraoua, Nacim; Nordmann, Jean-Philippe; Baudouin, Christophe; Borderie, Vincent",Cornea,,12
504377,Development and application of therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic represents the most significant public health disaster since the 1918 influenza pandemic. During pandemics such as COVID-19, timely and reliable spatio-temporal forecasting of epidemic dynamics is crucial. Deep learning-based time series models for forecasting have recently gained popularity and have been successfully used for epidemic forecasting. Here we focus on the design and analysis of deep learning-based models for COVID-19 forecasting. We implement multiple recurrent neural network-based deep learning models and combine them using the stacking ensemble technique. In order to incorporate the effects of multiple factors in COVID-19 spread, we consider multiple sources such as COVID-19 confirmed and death case count data and testing data for better predictions. To overcome the sparsity of training data and to address the dynamic correlation of the disease, we propose clustering-based training for high-resolution forecasting. The methods help us to identify the similar trends of certain groups of regions due to various spatio-temporal effects. We examine the proposed method for forecasting weekly COVID-19 new confirmed cases at county-, state-, and country-level. A comprehensive comparison between different time series models in COVID-19 context is conducted and analyzed.

Aims and Objectives: To study seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV2 to understand the pandemic status and deriving valid conclusions for guiding the public health measures for managing the covid19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: A serosurveillance study was carried out using population based stratified sampling for the general population of Ahmedabad city. Seroprevalence for Cases, Contacts and Health Care Workers (HCWs) was also estimated as separate additional categories. The seroprevalence was compared with various demographic factors for valid and precise predictions regarding the immunity status of the population. Results: As on October 2020, the seroprevalence for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV2 in the general population of Ahmedabad is 24.20% (95% Confidence Interval 23.57%–24.85%) The sero-positivity has increasing trend with age and is higher among females (24.83%) than males (23.72%) but is statistically not significant. The zone wise positivity ranged from 18.70% to 33.52%. The seropositivity among HCWs, contacts and cases are 20.84%, 26.05% and 54.51% respectively and it closely correlate with the risk. Conclusion: As on October 2020, general population demonstrate a seropositivity of 24.20%. The seropositivity among various groups is according to the risk of contracting the disease. Results also indicate the possibility of undetectable level or disappearing IgG during the post-covid period. Results also indicate that the preventive measures must be strongly followed for continued control of the pandemic situation till an effective vaccine is provided to the people at large.

508623,Novel Crabtree negative yeast from rumen fluids can improve rumen fermentation and milk quality,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Accumulating evidence supports the use of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), particularly bone marrow derived, as a safe and promising biologic therapy for promoting tissue repair and regeneration in various chronic diseases and disorders. Despite growing evidence that MSCs are potent anti-inflammatory mediators that can provide substantial benefits in acute organ injury, there are limited clinical trials utilizing MSCs in acute care settings, such as in the emergency department (ED) or intensive care unit (ICU). OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the current state of MSC-based therapeutics and further explores the untapped potential role to treat various acute, life-threating injuries in the ED and ICU. DISCUSSION: All clinical trials using MSCs in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) demonstrated safety. While some also demonstrate clinical efficacy, efficacy data is inconsistent, with some studies limited by sample size, cell integrity and different dosages, necessitating further studies. CONCLUSION: MSCs are potentially promising novel biologic therapeutics for clinical application in AMI, ARDS, sepsis, AKI and COVID-19 that have demonstrated safety in all clinical trials. More rigorous clinical trials are necessary and warranted to determine the efficacy of MSCs as a novel therapeutic in an acute setting, such as the ED.","Premer, Courtney; Schulman, Ivonne H; Jackson, Jennifer S",Am. j. emerg. med,,12

513314,"A Borderless Solution Is Needed for A Borderless Complexity, Like COVID-19, the Universal Invader",2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This pandemic is characterized by a high variability in death rate (defined as the ratio between the number of deaths and the total number of infected people) across world countries. Several possible explanations have been proposed, but it is not clear whether this variability is due to a single predominant factor or instead to multiple causes. Here we addressed this issue using multivariable regression analysis to test the impact of the following factors: the hospital stress (defined as the ratio between the number of infected cases and the total number of hospital beds), the population median age, and the quality of the National Health System (NHS). For this analysis, we chose countries of the world with over 3000 infected cases as of April 1, 2020. Hospital stress was found to be the crucial factor in explaining the variability of death rate, while the others had negligible relevance. Different procedures for quantifying cases of infection and death for COVID-19 could affect the variability in death rate across countries. We therefore applied the same statistical approach to Italy, which is divided into 20 Regions that share the same protocol for counting the outcomes of this pandemic. Correlation between hospital stress and death rate was even stronger than that observed for countries of the world. Based on our findings and the historical trend for the availability of hospital beds, we propose guidelines for policy-makers to properly manage future pandemics.","Bigiani, Lorenzo; Bigiani, Stefano; Bigiani, Albertino",Int. j. health policy manag,,12

516612,Transversal gene expression panel to evaluate intestinal health in broiler chickens in different challenging conditions,2021,"The important reasons for the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the lack of awareness of infected individuals about their health due to the 14 day incubation period of the virus and the subsequent un-intentional transmission, large scale ignorance of social distancing guidelines, and improper sanitary precautions and health. In this paper, we describe the development process of a system based solution for individuals to do Covid-19 susceptibility test using the SpO2 oxygen level detection test, to detect symptoms with higher levels of accuracy. We also discuss various other implementation features to prevent the unaware spread of the virus including providing details to the user regarding government guidelines related to containing transmission of the virus, alerts to the user about periodic maintenance of sanitary guidelines, social distancing, and notifying the user on non-compliance of above features. Finally, we discuss possible future extensions to stricter the measures taken up by the user to prevent any mistakes- like a front-camera based mask authentication approach, and alerting the user on entering crowded areas based on Bluetooth crowd sensing. Also, this system will be further developed into a mobile application.","Welekar, R.; Vairagade, M.; Sawal, M.; Rathi, S.; Shivdekar, S.; Belgamwar, S.",Bioscience Biotechnology Research Communications,,12
517113,"Silymarin alleviates docetaxel-induced central and peripheral neurotoxicity by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in rats",2020,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension (HPT) and its complications continue to pose a global threat and contribute to premature mortality worldwide. The adverse interactions between HPT, obesity and COVID-19 are currently being witnessed globally and represent a collision of pandemics. Understanding the burden that this non-communicable disease (NCD) poses in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province, South Africa (SA), would help in developing improved public healthcare strategies. OBJECTIVES: To describe the burden of HPT in all the districts of KZN over a 6-year period. METHODS: HPT data are routinely collected from all KZN public health facilities (both clinics and hospitals) as part of the District Health Information System (DHIS). In this retrospective study, we accessed HPT records from the DHIS over a period of 6 years (2014 - 2019, inclusive). Data collected included the number of patients screened, diagnosed and initiated on therapy for HPT, together with the number of obese patients. RESULTS: The slopes for HPT screening were positive at both clinics and hospitals in KZN (considerably more at clinics than hospitals, with a difference in elevations of slopes of p&lt;0.001), with a significantly greater percentage of the population having been screened at rural clinics than at hospitals (difference in elevation of slopes p&lt;0.001). A significantly greater number of patients aged &lt;40 years (p&lt;0.001) were being screened for HPT at clinics than at hospitals (2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20), while hospitals screened considerably more patients aged &#8805;40 years in 2017 - 2018 (p&lt;0.001). The numbers of new hypertensives diagnosed and having treatment initiated were on an upward slope at both clinics and hospitals, with clinics having a greater elevation of slope than hospitals (p&lt;0.001), irrespective of patient age. A significantly greater number of patients aged &#8805;40 years (p&lt;0.05) were diagnosed with HPT at both clinics and hospitals in KZN (2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20). KZN clinics remained the first port of call for known hypertensives throughout the study period. Obesity was prevalent at both clinic and hospital level, although figures were significantly higher at clinics. Over 80% of the obesity burden was carried by the rural clinics and hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Screening, diagnosis, treatment initiation and chronic management of HPT occur mainly at rural clinic level. The SA government needs to heed these findings and redirect resources (staffing and equipment) to this level. The prevalence of obesity was highest at rural healthcare facilities (clinics more than hospitals). More needs to be done to combat the obesity pandemic if we are to win the battle against NCDs (HPT and diabetes mellitus). A significant number of patients aged &lt;40 years are being screened for HPT, which bodes well for the province, as early diagnosis and treatment of HPT are vital to prevent complications.","Pillay, S; Pillay, D; Pillay, R S",S Afr Med J,,12

520839,Endothelial dysfunction and immunothrombosis as key pathogenic mechanisms in COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Understanding factors impacting deaths from COVID-19 is of the highest priority. Seasonal variation in environmental meteorological conditions affects the incidence of many infectious diseases and may also affect COVID-19. Ultraviolet (UV) A (UVA) radiation induces release of cutaneous photolabile nitric oxide (NO) impacting the cardiovascular system and metabolic syndrome, both COVID-19 risk factors. NO also inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV2. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between ambient UVA radiation and COVID-19 deaths. METHODS: COVID-19 deaths at the county level, across the USA, were modelled in a zero-inflated negative-binomial model with a random effect for states adjusting for confounding by demographic, socioeconomic and long-term environmental variables. Only those areas where UVB was too low to induce significant cutaneous vitamin D3 synthesis were modelled. We used satellite-derived estimates of UVA, UVB and temperature and relative humidity. Replication models were undertaken using comparable data for England and Italy. RESULTS: The mortality rate ratio (MRR) in the USA falls by 29% [95% confidence interval (CI) 40% to 15%) per 100 kJ m-2 increase in mean daily UVA. We replicated this in independent studies in Italy and England and estimate a pooled decline in MRR of 32% (95% CI 48% to 12%) per 100 kJ m-2 across the three studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that higher ambient UVA exposure is associated with lower COVID-19-specific mortality. Further research on the mechanism may indicate novel treatments. Optimized UVA exposure may have population health benefits.","Cherrie, M; Clemens, T; Colandrea, C; Feng, Z; Webb, D J; Weller, R B; Dibben, C",Br. j. dermatol,,12

We conducted a literature review on EMBASE, MEDLINE and SCIELO databases using the terms ""COVID-19"", ""COVID"", ""neurological"", ""neurologic"", ""manifestations"", ""implications"", ""Guillain-Barre syndrome"", ""encephalopathy"". A total of 33 articles including clinical series, retrospective studies, and case reports were selected and thoroughly reviewed to describe neurological manifestations of COVID-19. There are several neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection with different clinical presentations, severity, and prevalence. The most critical ones, such as cerebrovascular disease, encephalopathy, and Guillain-Barre syndrome, were less common and usually associated with previous medical history, known risk factors for cerebrovascular disease or advanced age. The main hypotheses for the spread of the virus are through the hematogenous route or the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone or a disseminated severe immune response by a cytokine storm. The presence of neurological disturbances associated with laboratory tests alterations is an important clue for the physicians to promptly recognize neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2.","Jardim Vaz de Mello, L.; Guimaraes Silva, E.; Oliveira Correa Rabelo, G.; Evaristo Leite, M.; Vieira, N.

590577,Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of 24 Components in Jinlianhua Decoction by UPLC–MS/MS,2019-09-28,"PURPOSE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency department (ED) volumes have fluctuated. We hypothesized that natural language processing (NLP) models could quantify changes in detection of acute abdominal pathology (acute appendicitis (AA), acute diverticulitis (AD), or bowel obstruction (BO)) on CT reports. METHODS: This retrospective study included 22,182 radiology reports from CT abdomen/pelvis studies performed at an urban ED between January 1, 2018 to August 14, 2020. Using a subset of 2448 manually annotated reports, we trained random forest NLP models to classify the presence of AA, AD, and BO in report impressions. Performance was assessed using 5-fold cross validation. The NLP classifiers were then applied to all reports. RESULTS: The NLP classifiers for AA, AD, and BO demonstrated cross-validation classification accuracies between 0.97 and 0.99 and F1-scores between 0.86 and 0.91. When applied to all CT reports, the estimated numbers of AA, AD, and BO cases decreased 43–57% in April 2020 (first regional peak of COVID-19 cases) compared to 2018–2019. However, the number of abdominal pathologies detected rebounded in May–July 2020, with increases above historical averages for AD. The proportions of CT studies with these pathologies did not significantly increase during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: Dramatic decreases in numbers of acute abdominal pathologies detected by ED CT studies were observed early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, though these numbers rapidly rebounded. The proportions of CT cases with these pathologies did not increase, which suggests patients deferred care during the first pandemic peak. NLP can help automatically track findings in ED radiology reporting.","Li, Matthew D.; Wood, Peter A.; Alkasab, Tarik K.; Lev, Michael H.; Kalpathy-Cramer, Jayashree; Succi, Marc D.",Am J Emerg Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675721004368; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.05.057; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675721004368?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34062318/,12

METHODS: In this study, the essential oil of Libyan Satureja thymbra was isolated from plants collected during two successive years at two different altitudes; Wasita (WEO) and Safsaf (SEO), 156 and 661 m above sea level, respectively. RESULTS: GC/MS allowed the identification of 21 and 23 compounds, respectively. Thymol prevailed in WEO (26.69%), while carvacrol prevailed in SEO (14.30%). Antimicrobial activity was tested by agar-well diffusion method, and MIC/MLC values were determined by broth dilution method. Values of MIC/MLC were 0.125/0.25 μg/ml for SEO against S. aureus, P. mirabilis and K. pneumonia and for WEO against B. subtilus. It was observed that plants growing at lower altitude in Wasita locality had better antifungal activity, while those growing at higher altitude at Safsaf locality had better antibacterial activity. Both essential oils had a better anthelmintic activity than the standard piperazine citrate against a tested earthworm. However, SEO oil had a significantly higher anthelmintic activity than WEO. Cytotoxicity of the oils tested using SRB assay on human breast cancer (MCF-7) and colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116) showed better activity for SEO, especially against HCT-116 with IC(50) 2.45 ± 0.21 μg/ml.

591130,Effect of Antioxidant Therapy on Oxidative Stress in Vivo,2021-02-25,"Las pandemias y otras catástrofes de alto impacto sanitario azotan periódicamente a la humanidad, aumentando desproporcionadamente la demanda por atención en servicios de urgencia, unidades de cuidados intensivos y medios de soporte vital avanzado. Este desequilibrio obliga a una compleja toma de decisiones en que se deben asignar recursos proporcionalmente escasos en relación a una gran demanda. Así, los equipos clínicos asistenciales necesitan actuar bajo criterios consensuados, que orienten sus decisiones y alivien la pesada carga moral de seleccionar pacientes para terapias, en detrimento de otros. El triaje es una estrategia que permite establecer, bajo racionalidades propias a cada escenario, objetivos y criterios que faciliten la toma de decisiones complejas para el logro del mejor resultado. Estas estrategias deben considerar el marco de valores intangibles que apreciamos y que nos identifican cultural y socialmente, como son el respeto a la vida, la igualdad, la justicia y la libertad. Sin embargo, en escenarios excepcionales como el de la actual pandemia COVID-19, en que el sistema sanitario puede no dar abasto, deberán establecerse objetivos prioritarios, como salvar la mayor cantidad de vida, del modo más humano, justo y eficiente posible. A la vez, deberán redefinirse jerarquías en los valores y principios clásicos de la práctica clínica cotidiana, adecuadas a la catástrofe sanitaria, bajo una ética propia de la salud pública, el mayor bien para la mayoría y el mejor cuidado de los que no pueden ser curados. Pandemics and other global disasters regularly overwhelm humankind. These catastrophic events suddenly increase demand for health-care in emergency services, intensive care units, and for advanced life support devices. This imbalance requires complex decision-making in which scarce resources must be allocated in relation to high demand. Thus, health-care teams need to act under consensus criteria that guide their decisions and alleviate the heavy moral burden of selecting patients for therapies, excluding others. Triage is a strategy that allows to establish, under appropriate rationalities, objectives and criteria that facilitate complex decisions to achieve the best results. These strategies should consider the framework of intangible values that we appreciate and identify us culturally and socially, such as respect for life, equity, justice and freedom. However, in exceptional scenarios such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, where the health system may be overcome, priority goals should focus in order to save as many lives as possible and by mean the most humane, fair and efficient way possible. At the same time, hierarchies of classical values and principles of daily clinical practice should be redefined in an appropriate way to face this catastrophic scenario, under an ethics for public health, the greatest good for the most and the best care of those who cannot be cured.","Burdiles, Patricio; Pommier, Armando Ortiz",Revista Médica Clínica Las Condes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0716864020300948; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0716864020300948,12

591742,Using population-wide administrative and laboratory data to estimate type- and subtype-specific influenza vaccine effectiveness: a surveillance protocol,2019-09-30,"Time analysis of the course of an infectious disease epidemic is a critical way to understand the dynamics of pathogen transmission and the effect of population scale interventions. Computational methods have been applied to the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak in five different countries (Ireland, Germany, UK, South Korea and Iceland) using their reported daily infection data. A Gaussian convolution smoothing function constructed a continuous epidemic line profile that was segmented into longitudinal time series of mathematically fitted individual logistic curves. The time series of fitted curves allowed comparison of disease progression with differences in decreasing daily infection numbers following the epidemic peak being of specific interest. A positive relationship between the rate of declining infections and countries with comprehensive COVID-19 testing regimes existed. Insight into different rates of decline infection numbers following the wave peak was also possible which could be a useful tool to guide the reopening of societies. In contrast, extended epidemic timeframes were recorded for those least prepared for large-scale testing and contact tracing. As many countries continue to struggle to implement population wide testing it is prudent to explore additional measures that could be employed. Comparative analysis of healthcare worker (HCW) infection data from Ireland shows it closely related to that of the entire population with respect to trends of daily infection numbers and growth rates over a 57-day period. With 31.6% of all test-confirmed infections in healthcare workers (all employees of healthcare facilities), they represent a concentrated 3% subset of the national population which if exhaustively tested (regardless of symptom status) could provide valuable information on disease progression in the entire population (or set). Mathematically, national population and HCWs can be viewed as a set and subset with significant influences on each other, with solidarity between both an essential ingredient for ending this crisis.","Wu, Dan; Mac Aonghusa, Pól; O’Shea, Donal F.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33891659/,12
591905,Viral Biothreat Agents,2009-01-30,"Introduction: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a novel viral agent that quickly spread worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and had an immeasurable toll on the economy. Currently, most clinical cases are identified by qualitative molecular testing. However, the need for quantitative assessment is gaining traction. Areas covered: In this review, the current state and future perspective of SARS-CoV-2 viral load quantification is presented. Expert opinion: Viral load quantification is a critical measure that informs clinicians of treatment response, actionable viral load levels, and guidance on patient management. Additionally, for pathogens with epidemiological consequences, viral load can provide information to guide infection control measures and policies. While qualitative detection is sufficient to identify cases and initiate containment and mitigation measures in the vast majority of COVID-19 cases, in certain situations, SARS-CoV-2 quantification is needed to assess viral load trending. However, there are obstacles to quantification, including variability in respiratory specimen collection and the lack of commutable reference material. At the same time, the need for quantification for clinical and epidemiological management is growing, especially concerning individuals with prolonged RNA shedding.","Lee, Mark J.",Expert Rev Mol Diagn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369836/; https://doi.org/10.1080/14737159.2021.1962709,12

Among the causes are risk of infection and prolonged isolation. This study aimed to analyze psychopathological variables and dysfunctional lifestyles related to adequate therapeutic compliance in kidney transplant recipients. Methods: Eighty-nine kidney transplant recipients were evaluated using an online protocol including a questionnaire concerning habits, lifestyle and psychophysical well-being in the COVID-19 period, the Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire (MHQ) and the SF-36 Health Survey to evaluate the perception of their physical and emotional health. Results: Of these recipients, 28.6% reported changes in their emotional state. Sleep quality deteriorated for 16.1%. Anxiety (M = 5.57, r = 0.33; p < 0.05) and phobia (M = 6.28, r = 0.26; p < 0.05) correlated with concerns related to physical health. There was no negative impact on relational and socialization aspects, which were likely well compensated by the use of remote technologies such as video phone calls, Zoom meetings and use of computers (r = 0.99; r = 0.80; p < 0.05). Conclusions: It would be interesting to maintain this remote visit and interview mode to monitor, on a clinical and psychological level, kidney transplant recipients in subsequent follow-ups (12–18 months), to check for any psychopathological disorders and/or changes in their resilience capacity in the Coronavirus emergency.","De Pasquale, Concetta; Pistorio, Maria Luisa; Veroux, Pierfrancesco; Gioco, Rossella; Giaquinta, Alessia; Privitera, Francesca; Veroux, Massimiliano",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177645/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.645549,12
593741,Propolis-induced exclusion of colloids: Possible new mechanism of biological action,2020-08-22,"Chemokines mediate leukocyte migration and homeostasis and are key targets in inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis, cytokine storm, and chronic autoimmune disease. Chemokine redundancy and ensuing network robustness has frustrated therapeutic development. Salivary evasins from ticks bind multiple chemokines to overcome redundancy and are effective in several preclinical disease models. Their clinical development has not progressed because of concerns regarding potential immunogenicity, parenteral delivery, and cost. Peptides mimicking protein activity can overcome the perceived limitations of therapeutic proteins. Here we show that peptides possessing multiple chemokine-binding and anti-inflammatory activities can be developed from the chemokine-binding site of an evasin. We used hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS to map the binding interface of the evasin P672 that physically interacts with C–C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 8 and synthesized a 16-mer peptide (BK1.1) based on this interface region in evasin P672. Fluorescent polarization and native MS approaches showed that BK1.1 binds CCL8, CCL7, and CCL18 and disrupts CCL8 homodimerization. We show that a BK1.1 derivative, BK1.3, has substantially improved ability to disrupt P672 binding to CCL8, CCL2, and CCL3 in an AlphaScreen assay. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we show that BK1.3 directly binds CCL8. BK1.3 also has substantially improved ability to inhibit CCL8, CCL7, CCL2, and CCL3 chemotactic function in vitro. We show that local as well as systemic administration of BK1.3 potently blocks inflammation in vivo. Identification and characterization of the chemokine-binding interface of evasins could thus inspire the development of novel anti-inflammatory peptides that therapeutically target the chemokine network in inflammatory diseases.","Darlot, Benoit; Eaton, James R.O.; Geis-Asteggiante, Lucia; Yakala, Gopala K.; Karuppanan, Kalimuthu; Davies, Graham; Robinson, Carol V.; Kawamura, Akane; Bhattacharya, Shoumo",Journal of Biological Chemistry,http://www.jbc.org/content/early/2020/05/28/jbc.RA120.014103.full.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.014103; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925817491952; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32471866/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925817491952,12

Herein we review the policy and clinical measures that should be considered to increase access to transplantation and improve post-transplantation outcomes. This Roadmap, generated by a group of major European stakeholders collaborating within a Thematic Network, presents an outline of the challenges to increasing transplantation rates and proposes 12 key areas along with specific measures that should be considered to promote transplantation. This framework can be adopted by countries and institutions that are interested in advancing transplantation, both within and outside the European Union.

Consistent with theories about the psychology of conspiracy beliefs, these calls predict that a lack of transparency may reduce trust in health authorities and may facilitate the spread of conspiracy theories, which may limit the long-term capabilities of health authorities during and after the pandemic. On the basis of preregistered experiments conducted on large, representative samples of Americans and Danes (N > 13,000), the current study contrasts the effects of vague vaccine communication with transparent communication, which discloses either positive or negative vaccine features. The evidence demonstrates that transparent negative communication may indeed harm vaccine acceptance here and now but that it increases trust in health authorities. Furthermore, the alternative of vague, reassuring communication does not increase vaccine acceptance either and leads to both lower trust and higher endorsement of conspiracy theories.","Petersen, Michael Bang; Bor, Alexander; Jørgensen, Frederik; Lindholt, Marie Fly",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2024597118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34292869/,12

598914,Pulmonary Surfactant and Drug Delivery: An Interface-Assisted Carrier to Deliver Surfactant Protein SP-D Into the Airways,2021-01-18,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The role of rodents in the transmission of many diseases is widely known. Wild rats abundant in urban environments may transmit diseases to humans and other animals, including laboratory rodents used for biomedical research in research facilities, possibly compromising research data. In order to gather information about the various diseases present around such facilities, it is important to conduct routine surveillance of wild rodents in the area. In this pilot study, we surveyed 22 captured wild rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus) from the Caribbean island of St. Kitts for 19 microorganisms. Information gained from such surveillance data would be beneficial in assessing regional public health risks and when implementing routine laboratory rodent health monitoring protocols. ABSTRACT: A pilot seroprevalence study was conducted to document exposure to selected pathogens in wild rats inhabiting the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. Serum samples collected from 22 captured wild rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus) were tested for the presence of antibodies to various rodent pathogens using a rat MFI2 serology panel. The samples were positive for cilia-associated respiratory bacillus (13/22; 59.1%), Clostridium piliforme (4/22; 18.2%), Mycoplasma pulmonis (4/22; 18.2%), Pneumocystis carinii (1/22; 4.5%), mouse adenovirus type 2 (16/22; 72.7%), Kilham rat virus (15/22; 68.2%), reovirus type 3 (9/22; 40.9%), rat parvovirus (4/22; 18.2%), rat minute virus (4/22; 18.2%), rat theilovirus (2/22; 9.1%), and infectious diarrhea of infant rats strain of group B rotavirus (rat rotavirus) (1/22; 4.5%). This study provides the first evidence of exposure to various rodent pathogens in wild rats on the island of St. Kitts. Periodic pathogen surveillance in the wild rat population would be beneficial in assessing potential regional zoonotic risks as well as in enhancing the current knowledge when implementing routine animal health monitoring protocols in facilities with laboratory rodent colonies.","Boey, Kenneth; Shiokawa, Kanae; Avsaroglu, Harutyun; Rajeev, Sreekumari",Animals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ani9050228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083284/,12

The global COVID-19 pandemic prompted an urgent need to provide services such as THRIVE while following guidelines for social distancing. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to describe the systematic implementation of THRIVE using an electronic delivery model. METHODS: The study involved an observational clinical program implementation project using the RE-AIM framework to contextualize the implementation strategies and results, and then the implementation of an electronically delivered CIH group medical appointment program (eTHRIVE). RESULTS: Clinical staff transitioned to 100% electronic delivery of the THRIVE curriculum using the new eTHRIVE delivery model. The current electronic delivery model, eTHRIVE, has effectively enrolled 10-12 veterans per cohort, with 8 cohorts, totaling 87 veterans to date. eTHRIVE attrition has been 6% (5/87) since initiation.

600241,Replicating and Non-replicating Viral Vectors for Vaccine Development,2007-12-01,"Mass vaccination offers a promising exit strategy for the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as vaccination progresses, demands to lift restrictions increase, despite most of the population remaining susceptible. Using our age-stratified SEIRD-ICU compartmental model and curated epidemiological and vaccination data, we quantified the rate (relative to vaccination progress) at which countries can lift non-pharmaceutical interventions without overwhelming their healthcare systems. We analyzed scenarios ranging from immediately lifting restrictions (accepting high mortality and morbidity) to reducing case numbers to a level where test-trace-and-isolate (TTI) programs efficiently compensate for local spreading events. In general, the age-dependent vaccination roll-out implies a transient decrease of more than ten years in the average age of ICU patients and deceased. The pace of vaccination determines the speed of lifting restrictions; Taking the European Union (EU) as an example case, all considered scenarios allow for steadily increasing contacts starting in May 2021 and relaxing most restrictions by autumn 2021. Throughout summer 2021, only mild contact restrictions will remain necessary. However, only high vaccine uptake can prevent further severe waves. Across EU countries, seroprevalence impacts the long-term success of vaccination campaigns more strongly than age demographics. In addition, we highlight the need for preventive measures to reduce contagion in school settings throughout the year 2021, where children might be drivers of contagion because of them remaining susceptible. Strategies that maintain low case numbers, instead of high ones, reduce infections and deaths by factors of eleven and five, respectively. In general, policies with low case numbers significantly benefit from vaccination, as the overall reduction in susceptibility will further diminish viral spread. Keeping case numbers low is the safest long-term strategy because it considerably reduces mortality and morbidity and offers better preparedness against emerging escape or more contagious virus variants while still allowing for higher contact numbers (freedom) with progressing vaccinations.","Bauer, Simon; Contreras, Sebastian; Dehning, Jonas; Linden, Matthias; Iftekhar, Emil; Mohr, Sebastian B.; Olivera-Nappa, Alvaro; Priesemann, Viola",PLoS Comput Biol,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34473693/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06228v4.pdf,12

This study aimed to understand the psychological impact of this disease on adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) at 1 month after the start of the outbreak in China. METHODS: Using the Children’s Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-13) questionnaire, we investigated the occurrence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in two groups of adolescents: MDD patients who were in continuous antidepressant therapy and healthy controls. Total scores and factor subscores were compared between the two groups and subgroups stratified by sex and school grade. Logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with high total CRIES-13 scores. RESULTS: Compared to controls (n = 107), the MDD group (n = 90) had higher total CRIES-13 scores and a higher proportion with a total score ≥ 30. They also had a lower intrusion subscore and a higher arousal subscore. In the MDD group, males and females did not differ significantly in total CRIES-13 scores or factor subscores, but junior high school students had higher avoidance subscores than senior high school students. Logistic regression showed high total CRIES-13 scores to be associated with MDD and the experience of “flashbacks” or avoidance of traumatic memories associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial to understand the psychological impact of COVID-19 on adolescents with MDD in China, especially females and junior high school students. Long-term monitoring of adolescents with a history of mental illness is required to further understand these impacts.

While conducting an observational cohort study on the relationship of attendance to performance and wellness, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown changed the ability of students to attend class. Matriculating medical students were recruited to participate at the beginning of their first year in August 2019. In-person attendance was collected prospectively until the lockdown began in March 2020. This was then correlated with performance on course final examinations and responses to two separate incidences of a survey on stress, burnout, social isolation, and loneliness. The first survey was deployed January through February 2020 (pre-COVID) and the second June 2020 (during COVID lockdown). Attendance declined across the year (76.0%–25.0%). There was a small positive correlation of attendance to performance in module 1 (r = 0.235, P = 0.035) with none in the remaining two modules (P = 0.870, P = 0.410). The high attenders at the time of the lockdown had no decline in their performance when attendance was no longer possible. Attendance negatively correlated with stress and loneliness but not with the remainder of the wellness metrics. There was no significant change in any of the wellness metrics between the pre-COVID and during COVID time points.

Here we reported significantly altered biodistribution and immune responses with the use of CD40-targeted adenovirus. Compared with unmodified adenovirus 5, the CD40-targeted adenovirus following intravenous administration (i.v.) resulted in increased transgene expressions in the lung and thymus, which normally do not take up significant amounts of adenovirus. Intradermal injection saw modified adenovirus being mainly processed in local draining lymph nodes and skin. Following intranasal administration (i.n.), neither unmodified nor targeted viruses were found to be in the liver or spleen, which predominantly took up the virus following i.v. administration. However, inadvertent infection of the brain was found with unmodified adenoviruses, with the second highest gene expression among 14 tissues examined. Importantly, such undesirable effects were largely ablated with the use of targeted vector. Moreover, the targeted adenovirus elicited more sustained antigen-specific cellular immune responses (up to 17-fold) at later time points (30 days post boosting), but also significantly hampered humoral responses irrespective of administration routes. Additional data suggest the skewed immune responses induced by the targeted adenoviruses were not due to the identity of the transgene but more likely a combination of overall transgene load and CD40 stimulation.

In this study, we aimed to explore the relationship between therapeutic effectiveness of remdesivir and complications of diabetes mellitus by observing the recovery period among diabetic and nondiabetic patients associated with COVID‐19 infection. A total of 850 COVID‐19 patients were recruited for this study, out of which 48% were diabetic and 52% were nondiabetics. The results of this study indicated that nondiabetic individuals administered with remdesivir recovered from COVID‐19 within 10 days showing a 95% confidence interval (p < 0.01), while the diabetic individuals recovered in 15 days. Nondiabetic patients administered with remdesivir exhibited higher chances of clinical improvement at 15th day than those who were associated with diabetes. Remdesivir administration improved the levels of various biochemical parameters, such as C‐reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, d‐Dimer, and ferritin both in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. However, a significant improvement (p < 0.01) was seen in the level of biochemical parameters among nondiabetic patients as compared to that of diabetic patients administered with remdesivir treatment. In the end, it was concluded that remdesivir could be considered as a possible therapeutic agent in the treatment of COVID‐19 both in diabetic and nondiabetic situations. However, diabetic patients showed a delayed recovery as compared with that of nondiabetic patients, in which the recovery rate was high.","Qureshi, Qiadat Hasnain; Ashraf, Taimoor; Rehman, Kanwal; Khosa, Muhammad Kaleem; Akash, Muhammad Sajid Hamid",J Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351640/,12
603582,Hemodialysis exacerbates proteolytic imbalance and pro-fibrotic platelet dysfunction,2021-06-03,"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel zoonotic coronavirus. Emerging evidence indicates that preexisting humoral immunity against other seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs) plays a critical role in the specific antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. However, current work to assess the effects of preexisting and cross-reactive anti-HCoVs antibodies has been limited. To address this issue, we have adapted our previously reported multiplex assay to simultaneously and quantitatively measure anti-HCoV antibodies. The full mPlex-CoV panel covers the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of three highly pathogenic HCoVs (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS) and four human seasonal strains (OC43, HKU1, NL63, 229E). Combining this assay with volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS), we measured the anti-HCoV IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies in fingerstick blood samples. The results demonstrate that the mPlex-CoV assay has high specificity and sensitivity. It can detect strain-specific anti-HCoV antibodies down to 0.1 ng/ml with 4 log assay range and with low intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (%CV). We also estimate multiple strain HCoVs IgG, IgA and IgM concentration in VAMS samples in three categories of subjects: pre-COVID-19 (n=21), post-COVID-19 convalescents (n=19), and COVID-19 vaccine recipients (n=14). Using metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, HCoVs IgG concentrations in fingerstick blood samples were well separated between the pre-COVID-19, post-COVID-19 convalescents, and COVID-19 vaccine recipients. In addition, we demonstrate how multi-dimensional scaling analysis can be used to visualize IgG mediated antibody immunity against multiple human coronaviruses. We conclude that the combination of VAMS and the mPlex-Cov assay is well suited to performing remote study sample collection under pandemic conditions to monitor HCoVs antibody responses in population studies.","Wang, Jiong; Li, Dongmei; Zhou, Qian; Wiltse, Alexander; Zand, Martin S.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.696370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34386006/,12
603747,Editorial overview: Intraspecies transmission of viruses: Human-to-human transmission,2017-02-28,"The COVID-19 literature highlights that bacterial infections are more common in fatal cases than recovered cases. If bacterial infections drive mortality in COVID-19, this has clear implications for patient management. However, it is possible that the enrichment of bacterial infections in COVID-19 fatalities is simply a by-product of late-stage pathology, leading to different advice for patient management. To address this question, we review current knowledge on bacterial infections in COVID-19, assess information from past viral respiratory pandemics, and simulate alternate causal models of interactions between virus, bacteria, and mortality in COVID-19. From these models, we conclude that currently available data are not sufficient to discriminate between these alternate causal pathways, and we highlight what data are required to determine the relative contribution of bacterial infection to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. We further summarize the potential long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Farrell, Jennifer M.; Zhao, Conan Y.; Tarquinio, Keiko M.; Brown, Sam P.",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.682571; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34354682/,12

COVID-19 is an unprecedented disaster that has disrupted lives worldwide and led to a rise in the incidence of mental health disorders. Given the widespread economic devastation due to COVID-19, many RA patients, already susceptible to mental illness, maybe at an increased risk of inaccessibility to medical care, accentuated stress, and consequent worsening of existent mental health disorders, or the onset of new mental health disorders such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, or depression. The objective of this review is to assess if there is an increased risk of mental health disorders in patients with RA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine has bridged the transition to remote chronic care in the pandemic period, though certain accessibility and technological challenges are to be addressed. Decreased access to care amid lockdowns and a proposed triggering of disease activity in patients with autoimmune disorders may potentially herald a massive spike in incidence or flares of patients diagnosed with RA in the coming months. Such a deluge of cases may be potentially devastating to an overburdened healthcare system. Rheumatologists may need to prepare for this eventuality and explore techniques to provide adequate care during these challenging times. The authors found that there is a significant association between the adverse impact on the mental health of RA patients and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, more research is needed to highlight individual risk factors.","Bhatia, Ansh; KC, Manish; Gupta, Latika",Rheumatol Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-021-04829-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33710419/,12

Zinc nanomaterials represent a versatile class of nanoproducts and nanoenabled devices as these nanomaterials can be synthesized in quantum amounts through economically affordable processes/approaches. Further, these nanomaterials exhibit potential targeted antimicrobial properties and low to negligible phytotoxicity activities that well-qualify them to be applied directly or in a deviant manner to accomplish significant antibacterial, antimycotic, antiviral, and antitoxigenic activities against diverse phytopathogens causing plant diseases. The photo-catalytic, fluorescent, and electron generating aspects associated with zinc nanomaterials have been utilized for the development of sensor systems (optical and electrochemical biosensors), enabling quick, early, sensitive, and on-field assessment or quantification of the test phytopathogen. However, the proficient use of Zn-derived nanomaterials in the management of plant pathogenic diseases as nanopesticides and on-field sensor system demands that the associated eco- and biosafety concerns should be well discerned and effectively sorted beforehand.

Knowledge gaps still exist as to whether the virus can cause minor disorders that are perceived later on during the first years of life in children who are exposed but are asymptomatic at birth. In this case series, we describe the outcomes related to neurodevelopment through the neurological assessment of 26 non-microcephalic children who had intrauterine exposure to Zika virus. Children were submitted for neurological examinations and Bayley Scales-III (cognition, language, and motor performance). The majority (65.4%) obtained satisfactory performance in neurodevelopment. The most impaired domain was language, with 30.7% impairment. Severe neurological disorders occurred in five children (19.2%) and these were spastic hemiparesis, epilepsy associated with congenital macrocephaly (Zika and human immunodeficiency virus), two cases of autism (one exposed to Zika and Toxoplasma gondii) and progressive sensorineural hearing loss (GJB2 mutation). We concluded that non-microcephalic children with intrauterine exposure to Zika virus, in their majority, had achieved satisfactory performance in all neurodevelopmental domains. One third of the cases had some impairment, but the predominant group had mild alterations, with low occurrence of moderate to severe disorders, similar to other studies in Brazil.","Abtibol-Bernardino, Marília Rosa; de Almeida Peixoto, Lucíola de Fátima Albuquerque; de Oliveira, Geruza Alfaia; de Almeida, Tatiane Freitas; Rodrigues, Gabriela Ribeiro Ivo; Otani, Rodrigo Haruo; Soares Chaves, Beatriz Caroline; de Souza Rodrigues, Cristina; de Andrade, Anny Beatriz Costa Antony; de Fatima Redivo, Elijane; Fernandes, Salete Sara; da Costa Castilho, Marcia; Gomes Benzecry, Silvana; Bôtto-Menezes, Camila; Martinez-Espinosa, Flor Ernestina; Costa Alecrim, Maria das Graças",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12111335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33233769/,12

Here, we assessed if tomographic HS is also a risk factor for severe COVID‐19 pneumonia. METHODS: We included 213 patients with a positive real time polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) test and chest computed tomography (CT) from an out‐hospital facility and a hospital. We obtained information on demographics; weight; height; smoking history; diabetes; hypertension; and cardiovascular, lung, and renal disease. Two radiologists scored the CO‐RADs system (COVID‐19 Reporting and Data System) (1 = normal, 2 = inconsistent, 3–4 = indeterminate, and 5 = typical findings) and the chest CT severity index (≥20 of 40 was considered severe disease). They evaluated the liver‐to‐spleen ratio (CT(L/S)) and defined tomographic steatosis as a CT(L/S) index ≤0.9. We used descriptive statistics, χ(2) and t student tests, logistic regression, and reported odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Of the patients, 61% were men, with a mean age of 51.2 years, 48.3% were CO‐RADs 1 and 51.7% CO‐RADs 2–5. Severe tomographic disease was present in 103 patients (48.4%), all CO‐RADs 5. This group was older; mostly men; and with a higher prevalence of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and HS (69.9 vs 29%).

Three modules have been developed to help achieve this goal, including: (i) a LC–MS Spectra Processing module which offers an easy-to-use pipeline that can perform automated parameter optimization and resumable analysis to significantly lower the barriers to LC-MS1 spectra processing; (ii) a Functional Analysis module which expands the previous MS Peaks to Pathways module to allow users to intuitively select any peak groups of interest and evaluate their enrichment of potential functions as defined by metabolic pathways and metabolite sets; (iii) a Functional Meta-Analysis module to combine multiple global metabolomics datasets obtained under complementary conditions or from similar studies to arrive at comprehensive functional insights. There are many other new functions including weighted joint-pathway analysis, data-driven network analysis, batch effect correction, merging technical replicates, improved compound name matching, etc. The web interface, graphics and underlying codebase have also been refactored to improve performance and user experience.

The recovered wastes were subjected to an energic washing step and then reprocessed into films by melt-extrusion, followed by compression molding to simulate the industrial processing conditions. The obtained materials were characterized and the optical, structural, thermal and crystallization behavior are reported. The mechanical recycling process leads to an increase of the crystallinity and a decrease of the intrinsic viscosity of the formulations, particularly in the sample based on blends of different 3D-PLA wastes. Moreover, the obtained films were disintegrated under composting conditions in less than one month and it was observed that recycled materials degrade somewhat faster than the starting 3D-PLA filament, as a consequence of the presence of shorter polymer chains. Finally, to increase the molecular weight of the recycled materials, the 3D-PLA wastes were submitted to a solid-state polymerization process at 110, 120, and 130 °C, observing that the recycled 3D-wastes materials based on a well-known reference grade experiences an improvement of the intrinsic viscosity, while that coming from different sources showed no significant changes. Thus, the results show that 3D printing PLA products provides an ideal environment for the implementation of distributed recycling program, in which wastes coming from well-known PLA grades can successfully be processed in films with good overall performance.","Beltrán, Freddys R.; Arrieta, Marina P.; Moreno, Eduardo; Gaspar, Gerald; Muneta, Luisa M.; Carrasco-Gallego, Ruth; Yáñez, Susana; Hidalgo-Carvajal, David; de la Orden, María U.; Martínez Urreaga, Joaquín",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33921369/; https://doi.org/10.3390/polym13081247,12

She presents a detailed overview of heroism in the context of clinical care, revealing that healthcare workers, when portrayed as heroes, face challenges in reconciling unreasonable expectations of personal sacrifice without reciprocity or ample structural support from institutions and the general public. We use narrative medicine, a field primarily concerned with honouring the intersubjective narratives shared between patients and providers, in our attempt to deepen the discussion about the ways Healthcare Heroes engenders military metaphor, antiscience discourse, and xenophobia in the USA. We argue that the militarised metaphor of Healthcare Heroes not only robs doctors and nurses of the ability to voice concerns for themselves and their patients, but effectively sacrifices them in a utilitarian bargain whereby human life is considered the expendable sacrifice necessary to 'open the U.S. economy'. Militaristic metaphors in medicine can be dangerous to both doctors and patients, thus, teaching and advocating for the critical skills to analyse and alter this language prevents undue harm to providers and patients, as well as our national and global communities.","Khan, Zahra; Iwai, Yoshiko; DasGupta, Sayantani",J Med Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33328220/; https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106753,12

METHODS: The clinical manifestations, laboratory parameters, and CT imaging findings were analyzed in 34 COVID-19 patients, confirmed by RT-PCR from January 20 to February 4 in Hainan Province. CT scores were compared between the discharged patients and the ICU patients. RESULTS: Fever (85%) and cough (79%) were most commonly seen. Ten (29%) patients demonstrated negative results on their first RT-PCR. Of the 34 (65%) patients, 22 showed pure ground-glass opacity. Of the 34 (50%) patients, 17 had five lobes of lung involvement, while the 23 (68%) patients had lower lobe involvement. The lesions of 24 (71%) patients were distributed mainly in the subpleural area. The initial CT lesions of ICU patients were distributed in both the subpleural area and centro-parenchyma (80%), and the lesions were scattered. Sixty percent of ICU patients had five lobes involved, while this was seen in only 25% of the discharged patients. The lesions of discharged patients were mainly in the subpleural area (75%). Of the discharged patients, 62.5% showed pure ground-glass opacities; 80% of the ICU patients were in the progressive stage, and 75% of the discharged patients were at an early stage. CT scores of the ICU patients were significantly higher than those of the discharged patients. CONCLUSION: Chest CT plays a crucial role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly for those patients with a negative RT-PCR. The initial features in CT may be associated with prognosis.

Here we show that human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture devices lined by highly differentiated human primary lung airway epithelium and endothelium can be used to model virus entry, replication, strain-dependent virulence, host cytokine production, and recruitment of circulating immune cells in response to infection by respiratory viruses with great pandemic potential. We provide a first demonstration of drug repurposing by using oseltamivir in influenza A virus-infected organ chip cultures and show that co-administration of the approved anticoagulant drug, nafamostat, can double oseltamivir’s therapeutic time window. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Airway Chips were used to assess the inhibitory activities of approved drugs that showed inhibition in traditional cell culture assays only to find that most failed when tested in the Organ Chip platform. When administered in human Airway Chips under flow at a clinically relevant dose, one drug – amodiaquine - significantly inhibited infection by a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus. Proof of concept was provided by showing that amodiaquine and its active metabolite (desethylamodiaquine) also significantly reduce viral load in both direct infection and animal-to-animal transmission models of native SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. These data highlight the value of Organ Chip technology as a more stringent and physiologically relevant platform for drug repurposing, and suggest that amodiaquine should be considered for future clinical testing.","Si, Longlong; Bai, Haiqing; Rodas, Melissa; Cao, Wuji; Oh, Crystal Yuri; Jiang, Amanda; Moller, Rasmus; Hoagland, Daisy; Oishi, Kohei; Horiuchi, Shu; Uhl, Skyler; Blanco-Melo, Daniel; Albrecht, Randy A.; Liu, Wen-Chun; Jordan, Tristan; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E.; Logue, James; Haupt, Robert; McGrath, Marisa; Weston, Stuart; Nurani, Atiq; Kim, Seong Min; Zhu, Danni Y.; Benam, Kambez H.; Goyal, Girija; Gilpin, Sarah E.; Prantil-Baun, Rachelle; Powers, Rani K.; Carlson, Kenneth; Frieman, Matthew; tenOever, Benjamin R.; Ingber, Donald E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.039917,12

Although chest CT is a pivotal diagnostic tool for COVID-19 pneumonia, CT is expensive and also radiological burden for patients. There is urgent to investigate the role of lung ultrasound (LUS) in diagnosing and monitoring COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A total of 8 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in Shantou Central Hospital from January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively studied. All participants underwent chest HRCT and LUS examination; both were independently performed within 1 day of the other. The radiological patterns were reviewed by 2 radiologists who were blind to the clinical information. A senior ultrasound physician, blind to HRCT results and clinical data, performed bedside LUS in the isolation ward. The CT score was used (a semi-quantitative scoring system) to assess radiographic severity and extent. A B-lines score denoting the extent and severity of sonographic lesion was calculated by summing the number of B-lines on 18 scanning sites. RESULTS: B-lines (100%), pleural irregularities (25%), consolidation (25%), and pleural effusion (25%) were the main findings of LUS examination. Interstitial abnormalities, ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidations and local or bilateral patchy shadowing were the main findings of HRCT examination. The findings of LUS and HRCT were compared point to point and high consistency was found between the 2 measurements. A significant correlation was also found between the B-lines score and CT score [r=0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81 to 0.99, P=0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Both LUS patterns and B-lines score are significantly correlated with HRCT findings and score, respectively, supporting its role in assessing COVID-19 pneumonia severity, screening, and following up dynamic changes of pneumonia.","Du, Guangzhou; Wang, Yukai; Chen, Zhanhong; Chen, Yanlin; Zhang, Qingwu; Lin, Daiying; Wang, Liangyu",Ann Palliat Med,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-21-1731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34353099/,12

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic people is an urgent priority for the prevention and containment of disease outbreaks in communities. However, few data are available in asymptomatic persons regarding the accuracy of PCR testing. Additionally, although self-collected saliva has significant logistical advantages in mass screening, its utility as an alternative specimen in asymptomatic persons is yet to be determined. METHODS: We conducted a mass-screening study to compare the utility of nucleic acid amplification, such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, using nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples from each individual in two cohorts of asymptomatic persons: the contact tracing cohort and the airport quarantine cohort. RESULTS: In this mass-screening study including 1,924 individuals, the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification testing with nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were 86% (90%CI:77-93%) and 92% (90%CI:83-97%), respectively, with specificities greater than 99.9%. The true concordance probability between the nasopharyngeal and saliva tests was estimated at 0.998 (90%CI:0.996-0.999) on the estimated airport prevalence at 0.3%.

This disease is called COVID-19 and has been declared as a pandemic by the WHO three months after its outbreak (in March 2020). In most cases it results in non-severe infectious syndrome associated with different degrees of benign symptoms (fever, cough, myalgia, headache and potential digestive disorders). SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe lung diseased and, sometimes, it results in death. Data on its consequences during pregnancy are limited. Currently, data on SARS-CoV-2 infection are reassuring and don´t indicate a higher risk of infection or a superimposed risk of complications in pregnant women compared to the general population. A few exceptional cases of maternal mortality have been reported, but they occur, most often, in patients with other diseases, in particular pre-eclampsia. This retrospective study highlights the clinical, biological and evolutionary materno-fetal data collected in the COVID-19 Military Field Hospital of Benslimane, Morocco, over a period of 3 months, from 21(st) July to 21 October 2020.","Benlghazi, Abdelhamid; Benali, Saad; Bouhtouri, Yassine; Belouad, Moad; Massoudi, Hamza; Kouach, Jaouad",Pan Afr Med J,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2021.38.384.28695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34381528/,12
613289,The effect of plant metabolites on coronaviruses: A comprehensive review focusing on their IC50 values and molecular docking scores.,2021-08-31,"BACKGROUND: Nonmedical use of prescription opioids (defined as taking opioid medications for hedonic effects or in a manner other than prescribed) and the use of heroin have emerged in recent years as major public health concerns in the United States. Of particular concern is the prevalence of opioid use among emerging adults (ages 18–25), as this is a developmental period of heightened vulnerability and critical social, neurological, and psychological development. Data from 2015 show that American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people have the highest rates of diagnosis for opioid use disorders (OUDs). One recent study found that the overdose death rate among urban-dwelling AI/AN individuals was 1.4 times higher compared to those living in rural areas. To date, there are no evidence-based prevention programs addressing opioid use among urban AI/AN emerging adults that integrate culturally-appropriate strategies with evidence-based treatment. Traditions and Connections for Urban Native Americans (TACUNA) builds on our prior work with AI/AN communities across California to develop and evaluate culturally appropriate programming to address opioid, alcohol, and cannabis use among urban AI/AN emerging adults. METHODS/DESIGN: In a randomized controlled trial, 18–25 year old urban AI/AN emerging adults will receive either TACUNA (n = 185), which comprises three virtual workshops utilizing motivational interviewing, social network visualization, and integrating traditional practices and a wellness circle, or one virtual culturally sensitive opioid education workshop (n = 185). We will evaluate intervention effects on primary outcomes of frequency of opioid, alcohol, and cannabis use, as well as secondary outcomes of social network characteristics and cultural connectedness, over a 12-month period. DISCUSSION: This project has the potential to expand the range and effectiveness of opioid, alcohol, and cannabis services for urban AI/AN emerging adults by addressing the opioid epidemic and use of other substances at both the community and individual level. In addition, it provides important culturally grounded conceptual and practical information to advance the field of substance use interventions and enhance resiliency among this population.

The COVID-19 pandemic has hastened the general adoption of telemedicine as a protocol in hospitals and healthcare and led to a rapid paradigm shift from medical expertise to telemedicine eHealth. Because nurses play a significant role as members of interdisciplinary teams, we are expected to quickly adapt to and use artificial intelligence and other new technology innovations. This article elucidates the intellectual-property-right-related responsibilities and obligations of nurses and attendant legal risks in the context of smart medical research, clinical care standards, information laws and rules, and related policymaking.

In a “proof-of-concept” evaluation of the developed microarray, the microarray was compared with real-time PCR from 14 sputum specimens from COPD patients. All of the samples positive for bacterial species in real-time PCR were also positive for the same bacterial species using the microarray. This study shows that a microarray using PCR probes is a potentially useful method to monitor the populations of bacteria in respiratory specimens and can be tailored to specific clinical needs such as respiratory infections of particular patient populations, including patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis.","Curran, Tanya; Coulter, Wilson A.; Fairley, Derek J.; McManus, Terence; Kidney, Joe; Larkin, Mike; Moore, John E.; Coyle, Peter V.",J Microbiol Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167701210000059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20074591/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2010.01.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701210000059,12
615026,Diseases Involving Myelin,2012-02-29,"BACKGROUND: The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) decreased the probability of viral transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some drawbacks have been observed with its extensive use, such as headaches, anxiety, and stress among physicians, which could affect decision-making processes, the performance of physicians, and consequently patients’ safety. Few articles have studied the impact of PPE on physicians from different specialties. This study assessed the effect of wearing PPE on the performance and decision-making of physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared the effects of wearing PPE on physicians from different specialties. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out through an anonymous 39-item online questionnaire. The physicians were divided according to the probability and frequency of performing invasive procedures. Group 1 included emergency medicine and critical care physicians, intensivists, and anesthetists, group 2 included physicians from different surgical subspecialties, and group 3 included physicians from different medical fields. RESULTS: This study included 272 physicians; group 1 included 54, group 2 included 120, and group 3 included 98 physicians. Approximately, 90.4% of the participants aged between 30 and -40 years, and 72.8% of the participants were specialists. Results indicated that the comfort, vision, and communication were significantly reduced in all groups (81.1%, 88.7%, and 75.5%, respectively). In contrast, the handling of instruments was not significantly affected in the second group only. In addition, the decision-making and the rate of complications were not significantly affected. CONCLUSION: There was a negative impact of wearing PPE on the non-technical skills (vision, communication and overall comfort), and the technical skills of the physicians. The decision-making and patients’ safety were not significantly affected. Recommendations include additional improvement of the PPE design due to its crucial effect on both non-technical and technical skills of physicians.","Foula, Mohammed S.; Nwesar, Fayrouz A.; Oraby, Esraa H.; Foula, Ahmed; Alarfaj, Mosab A.; Foula, Hassan S.; Mohamed, Noha E.",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080121004386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127939/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102488; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080121004386?v=s5,12
615079,Immunoglobulin germline gene variation and its impact on human disease,2021-06-26,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore factors affecting behavioral intention of receiving periodic health examinations (hereafter, BIE) among people aged 60 and over in rural China, namely, Shandong Province, using the extended health belief model (EHBM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants were selected using stratified multi-stage random sampling. Three cities were selected based on economic level. Subsequently, three counties and three villages were selected from each sample city and county. Finally, 30 respondents were selected from each sample village. Face-to-face surveys were conducted using a structured questionnaire between March and September 2017. Multiple linear regression was conducted to investigate the association between BIE and eight dimensions of EHBM: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, perceived self-efficacy, cues to action, health knowledge, and social support. RESULTS: Of the 509 rural respondents aged 60 years and older, the average score of behavioral intention was 4.43±0.80. Multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated poor BIE among participants who were men, were current smoker, were current drinker, were aged 70 years or over, had lower social support, and perceived lower self-efficacy, less benefits, and more barriers. Among them, barriers were found to have the strongest association with BIE (B’=−0.556; p<0.001). Qualitative interviews revealed that reasons for not receiving periodic health examinations (PHE) included pain, cost, difficulty in finding a health care provider, time and scheduling, potential lack of trust in the physician, and value of the PHE. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the importance of psychological variables in the acceptance of PHE among the elderly in rural China and provided insights for further intervention designs targeting identified groups and performed by general practitioners. Addressing medical mistrust, strengthening, and enhancing one’s social support network and health communication channels, such as bulletin boards, may serve to facilitate BIE.","Zhang, Zhuo; Yin, Ai-Tian; Bian, Ying",Patient Prefer Adherence,https://doi.org/10.2147/ppa.s312806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34188452/,12
615549,Analysis of cell-mediated immunity in people with long Covid.,2021-06-09,"Safe and accessible water services for hand hygiene are critical to human health and well-being. However, access to handwashing facilities is limited in cities in the Global South, where rapid urbanisation, service backlogs, lack of infrastructure and capacity, and water scarcity impact on the ability of local governments to provide them. Community participation and the co-production of knowledge in the development of innovative technologies, which are aligned with Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) principles, can lead to more sustainable and socially-acceptable hand hygiene systems. This paper presents the outcomes of the testing of the Autarky handwashing station, a technology that provides onsite treatment and recycling of handwashing water, in an informal settlement in Durban, South Africa. The transdisciplinary research approach adopted enabled the participation of multiple stakeholders with different knowledge systems in the framing, testing and evaluation of the system. The process of co-producing knowledge, as well as the outcomes of the testing, namely high levels of functionality and social acceptability of the technology, supported the WASH principles. The evaluation revealed that the Autarky handwashing station is a niche intervention that improved access to safe and appealing handwashing facilities in an informal settlement. Its novel design, socially desirable features, reliability and ability to save water increased its acceptance in the community. The testing of the system in a real-world context revealed the value of including communities in knowledge production processes for technology innovation. Further work is required to ensure that real-time monitoring of system function is feasible before such systems can be implemented at larger scale.","Sutherland, Catherine; Reynaert, Eva; Sindall, Rebecca C; Riechmann, Michel E; Magwaza, Fanelesibonge; Lienert, Juri; Buthelezi, Sibongile; Khumalo, Duduzile; Dhlamini, Sifiso; Morgenroth, Eberhard; Udert, Kai M",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34328886/,12

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on adult patients undergoing urgent or emergent cardiac catheterization for suspected ACS or OHCA between January 1, 2020 and June 2, 2020 at three hospitals in Los Angeles, CA, USA. We designated January 1, 2020 to March 17, 2020 as the PI COVID-19 period, March 18, 2020 to May 5, 2020 as the SI COVID-19 period, and May 6, 2020 to June 2, 2020 as the RI COVID-19 period. RESULTS: From PI to SI, there was a significant reduction in mean weekly cases of catheterizations for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction/unstable angina (NSTEMI/UA) (8.29 vs. 12.5, P = 0.019), with all other clinical categories trending downwards. From SI to RI, mean weekly cases of catheterizations for total ACS increased by 17%, NSTEMI/UA increased by 27%, and OHCA increased by 32%, demonstrating a “rebound effect”.

A 56% reduction in total transfusion sessions was observed in 2020 (588 sessions given to 176 patients) compared to 1336 sessions in 516 patients over the same period in 2019. The reductions were seen across the different blood components (packed red blood cells [PRBC]: 585 vs. 1840, platelet rich plasma: 372 vs. 1313, single donor platelet 18 vs. 16), with a significant reduction in the mean PRBC transfused per PRBC transfusion session (1.11 vs 1.99, p<0.001) in 2020, compared to 2019. There were however no major differences in the transfusion practices across the different phases of the lockdown.

The exact etiology of this disease is still unknown, and hence even its pathophysiology remains unclear. We present a case of a 27-year-old Saudi male patient who had been bed-bound with a known case of a congenital anomaly with severe kyphoscoliosis, bilateral lower limbs deformity with paraplegia, and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt since childhood. The patient was brought to the emergency department (ED) with right flank pain associated with fever and difficulty in breathing. The patient had a past medical history of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) with up to two incidences per year and renal stones. He had been recently discharged from the ICU of another hospital with sepsis due to UTI. An abdominal CT scan was performed, which showed a mass in the upper lobe of the right kidney measuring about 9 x 8 x 6 cm, suggestive of XGP. The final diagnosis was severe urosepsis secondary to right obstructive pyelonephritis. Patients with XGP usually present with nonspecific symptoms including back and abdominal pain, fever, UTI, and the condition is more common among middle-aged women.

617595,Inorganic and Polymeric Nanoparticles for Human Viral and Bacterial Infections Prevention and Treatment,2021-01-08,"Until now, no approved effective vaccine and antiviral therapeutic are available for treatment or prevention of SARS-coronavirus 2 (SCoV-2) virus infection. In this study, we established a SCoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SP), including a SP mutant D614G, pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector system and tested their ability to infect ACE2-expressing cells. This study revealed that a C-terminal 17 amino acid deletion in SCoV-2 SP significantly increases the incorporation of SP into the pseudotyped viruses and enhanced its infectivity, which may be helpful in the design of SCoV2-SP-based vaccine strategies. Moreover, based on this system, we have demonstrated that an aqueous extract from the Chinese herb Prunella vulgaris (CHPV) and a compound, suramin, displayed potent inhibitory effects on both wild type and mutant (G614) SCoV-2 SP pseudotyped virus (SCoV-2-SP-PVs)-mediated infection. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for CHPV and suramin on SCoV-2-SP-PVs are 30, and 40 μg/ml, respectively. To define the mechanisms of their actions, we demonstrated that both CHPV and suramin are able to directly interrupt SCoV-2–SP binding to its receptor ACE2 and block the viral entry step. Importantly, our results also showed that CHPV or suramin can efficiently reduce levels of cytopathic effect caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020) infection in Vero cells. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the combination of CHPV/suramin with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody mediated more potent blocking effect against SCoV2-SP-PVs. Overall, this study provides evidence that CHPV and suramin has anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and may be developed as a novel antiviral approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ao, Zhujun; Chan, Mable; Ouyang, Maggie Jing; Abiola, Olukitibi Titus; Mahmoudi, Mona; Kobasa, Darwyn; Yao, Xiaojian",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.28.270306,12

We found substantial gene alterations in COVID-19-impacted organs, especially the lung where altered TCR repertoires are noted. Reduced TCR repertoires are also observed in PBMCs of severe COVID-19 patients. ENTPD1/CD39, an ectoenzyme defining exhausted T-cells, is upregulated in the lung, liver, spleen and PBMCs of severe COVID-19 patients where expression positively correlates with markers of vasculopathy. Heightened ENTPD1/CD39 is paralleled by elevations in STAT-3 and HIF-1α transcription factors; and by markedly reduced CD39-antisense-RNA, a long-noncoding-RNA negatively regulating ENTPD1/CD39 at the post-transcriptional level.

We improved the stability and reliability of the RT-LAMP assay by the addition of a temperature-dependent switch oligonucleotide to reduce self- or off-target amplification. We then developed freeze-dried master mix for single step RT-LAMP reaction, simplifying the operation for end users and improving long-term storage and transportation. The assay can detect as low as 13 copies of SARS-CoV2 RNA per reaction (25-μL). Cross reactivity with other human coronaviruses was not observed. We have applied the new RT-LAMP assay for testing clinical extracted RNA samples extracted from swabs of 72 patients in the UK and 126 samples from Greece and demonstrated the overall sensitivity of 90.2% (95% CI 83.8–94.7%) and specificity of 92.4% (95% CI 83.2–97.5%). Among 115 positive samples which Ct values were less than 34, the RT-LAMP assay was able to detect 110 of them with 95.6% sensitivity. The specificity was 100% when RNA elution used RNase-free water.

Alarming concern is, the number of second wave infections surpassed the first wave and the onset of severe symptoms manifesting rapidly. In this scenario, testing of maximum population in less time and minimum cost with existing diagnostic amenities is the only possible way to control the spread of the virus. The previously described RNA extraction-free methods using dry swab have been shown to be advantageous in these critical times by different studies. In this work, we show the temporal stability and performance of the dry swab viral detection method at two different temperatures. Contrived dry swabs holding serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 strains A2a and A3i at 25{degrees} (room temperature; RT) and 4{degrees} were subjected to direct RT-PCR and compared with standard VTM-RNA based method. The results clearly indicate that dry swab method of RNA detection is as efficient as VTM-RNA-based method in both strains, when checked for up to 72 hours. The lesser CT values of dry swab samples in comparison to that of the VTM-RNA samples suggest better sensitivity of the method within 48 hours of time.

618798,Sexual Dimorphism in Innate Immunity: The Role of Sex Hormones and Epigenetics,2021-01-21,"The potential long-term impacts of natural or man-made disasters on children and adolescents have been the subject of numerous scientific research studies over the past decades. Since the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, it has become even more important to continue these investigations in order to address the special needs of our youth. While the virus itself appears to cause less pathology in them compared to adults, the effects go beyond the disease itself. The pandemic has caused extremely high levels of stress for both the children and their families. As a result, special attention has to be given to the possible long-term impacts on their growth and development. It is very important for physicians and other healthcare providers to recognize the signs and symptoms of stress and monitor for physical and mental health inequities, and to be able to provide support when help is needed. Identifying culturally effective solutions and reaching out to community based organizations or partners for resources and programs with which families identify is an important part of this healing provision. Mind-body therapies and practices such as meditation, visualization, breathing exercises, Movazeneh®, and Tamarkoz® are effective complementary therapies that can be utilized in pediatrics and help children and adolescents learn self-care skills that they could apply throughout their lives. Health providers should become educated in these safe and noninvasive techniques themselves, and consider them as possible therapeutic approaches for the treatment of stress in their pediatric patients.","Amjadi, Kimiya",Glob Pediatr Health,https://doi.org/10.1177/2333794x211042464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34471654/,12
618929,Architectural Insight into Inovirus-Associated Vectors (IAVs) and Development of IAV-Based Vaccines Inducing Humoral and Cellular Responses: Implications in HIV-1 Vaccines,2014-12-17,"BACKGROUND: The recent reclassification of formaldehyde as a presumed carcinogen prompted the investigation into the comparative efficacy of hydrogen peroxide as a fumigant in microbiological safety cabinets. INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to quantify the biocidal efficacy of formaldehyde fumigation, including variables such as exposure time and concentration, and then to compare this to the biocidal efficacy achieved from a hydrogen peroxide vapor fumigation system. The study also investigated the ability of both fumigants to permeate the microbiological safety cabinet (MBSC), including the workspace, under the work tray, and after the HEPA filters. Furthermore, the effect of organic soiling on efficacy was also assessed. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was used as the biological target to develop this study model. METHODS: A model using IBV was developed to determine the efficacy of formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide as fumigants. Virus was dried on stainless steel discs, and variables including concentration, time, protein soiling, and location within an MBSC were assessed. RESULTS: It was demonstrated that formaldehyde fumigation could achieve a 6-log reduction in the titer of the virus throughout the cabinet, and high protein soiling in the presentation did not affect efficacy. Appropriate cycle parameters for the hydrogen peroxide system were developed, and when challenged with IBV, it was shown that vaporized hydrogen peroxide could achieve an equal 6-log titer reduction as formaldehyde within the cabinet workspace and overcome the presence of soiling. CONCLUSION: Hydrogen peroxide was demonstrated to be a viable alternative to formaldehyde under most situations tested. However, the hydrogen peroxide system did not achieve an equal titer reduction above the cabinet’s first HEPA filter using the cabinet workspace cycle, and further optimization of the hydrogen peroxide cycle parameters, including pulsing of the cabinet fans, may be required to achieve this.","Stuart, Jamie; Chewins, John; Tearle, Jason",Appl Biosaf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191920/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1535676020909998,12

619619,Current perspectives in transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases: emerging and re-emerging infections,2014-07-28,"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) caused by viruses are increasing in frequency, causing a high disease burden and mortality world-wide. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) underscores the need to innovate and accelerate the development of effective vaccination strategies against EIDs. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules play a central role in the immune system by determining the peptide repertoire displayed to the T-cell compartment. Genetic polymorphisms of the HLA system thus confer a strong variability in vaccine-induced immune responses and may complicate the selection of vaccine candidates, because the distribution and frequencies of HLA alleles are highly variable among different ethnic groups. Herein, we build on the emerging paradigm of rational epitope-based vaccine design, by describing an immunoinformatics tool (Predivac-3.0) for proteome-wide T-cell epitope discovery that accounts for ethnic-level variations in immune responsiveness. Predivac-3.0 implements both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitope predictions based on HLA allele frequencies retrieved from the Allele Frequency Net Database. The tool was thoroughly assessed, proving comparable performances (AUC ~0.9) against four state-of-the-art pan-specific immunoinformatics methods capable of population-level analysis (NetMHCPan-4.0, Pickpocket, PSSMHCPan and SMM), as well as a strong accuracy on proteome-wide T-cell epitope predictions for HIV-specific immune responses in the Japanese population. The utility of the method was investigated for the COVID-19 pandemic, by performing in silico T-cell epitope mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein according to the ethnic context of the countries where the ChAdOx1 vaccine is currently initiating phase III clinical trials. Potentially immunodominant CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitopes and population coverages were predicted for each population (the Epitope Discovery mode), along with optimized sets of broadly recognized (promiscuous) T-cell epitopes maximizing coverage in the target populations (the Epitope Optimization mode). Population-specific epitope-rich regions (T-cell epitope clusters) were further predicted in protein antigens based on combined criteria of epitope density and population coverage. Overall, we conclude that Predivac-3.0 holds potential to contribute in the understanding of ethnic-level variations of vaccine-induced immune responsiveness and to guide the development of epitope-based next-generation vaccines against emerging pathogens, whose geographic distributions and populations in need of vaccinations are often well-defined for regional epidemics.","Oyarzun, Patricio; Kashyap, Manju; Fica, Victor; Salas-Burgos, Alexis; Gonzalez-Galarza, Faviel F.; McCabe, Antony; Jones, Andrew R.; Middleton, Derek; Kobe, Bostjan",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33717077/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.598778,12

The extant studies have identified two distinct attitudes of consumers about food label information: one is its usefulness and the second elucidates the avoidance. Hence forth, the current study contributes to the extant literature while signifying both reasons which motivate consumers to read food labels and reasons which discourage consumers from consult food labels at the point of purchase. Moreover, the impact of subjective norms and self-efficacy for healthy packaged food intentions has also been examined for both before the emergence of COVID-19 and during the spread of COVID-19. The underpinning of the proposed model has been justified by the behavioral reasoning theory. The cross-sectional data of 14,455 students has was collected from 10 universities through Microsoft Teams and Zoom. AMOS 21 was employed for the final analysis. The results indicate that before COVID-19 the subjective norms and self-efficacy were not the stimulating factors for the selection of healthy packaged food. On the contrary, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the subjective norms and self-efficacy divulged a significant effect. Moreover, the reasons to consult food labels are positively significant whereas the reasons to avoid food labels have negatively affected the consumer, both before COVID-19 and during COVID-19 outbreak, while endorsing healthy packaged food. Conclusively, COVID-19 has been proved to be a deterrent for unhealthy packaged food lovers while being a blessing for healthy packaged food.","Zafar, Muhammad Zeeshan; Maqbool, Adnan; Cioca, Lucian-Ionel; Shah, Syed Ghulam Meran; Masud, Shahjahan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33799559/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18062846,12

Watson,C.J., Stott,D., Rigby,P.W. and Reith,A.D. (2001), Nucleic Acids Res., 29, 4079–4088]. Here, we have employed site-directed mutagenesis and RNA structure probing to characterize the Edr signal. We began by confirming the functionality and magnitude of the signal and the role of a GGGAAAC motif as the slippery sequence. Subsequently, we derived a model of the Edr stimulatory RNA and assessed its similarity to those stimulatory RNAs found at viral frameshift sites. We found that the structure is an RNA pseudoknot possessing features typical of retroviral frameshifter pseudoknots. From these experiments, we conclude that the Edr signal and by inference, the human orthologue PEG10, do not represent a novel ‘cellular class’ of programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift signal, but rather are similar to viral examples, albeit with some interesting features. The similarity to viral frameshift signals may complicate the design of antiviral therapies that target the frameshift process.","Manktelow, Emily; Shigemoto, Kazuhiro; Brierley, Ian",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15767280/,12

However, high variability in results emerged, potentially due to logistic paradigms adopted. Here, we analyze stroke code admissions, hospitalizations, and stroke belt performance for ischemic stroke patients in the metropolitan Bologna region, comparing temporal trends between 2019 and 2020 to define the impact of COVID-19 on the stroke network. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all people admitted at the Bologna Metropolitan Stroke Center in timeframes 1 March 2019–30 April 2019 (cohort-2019) and 1 March 2020–30 April 2020 (cohort-2020). Diagnosis, treatment strategy, and timing were compared between the two cohorts to define temporal trends. RESULTS: Overall, 283 patients were admitted to the Stroke Center, with no differences in demographic factors between cohort-2019 and cohort-2020. In cohort-2020, transient ischemic attack (TIA) was significantly less prevalent than 2019 (6.9% vs 14.4%, p = .04). Among 216 ischemic stroke patients, moderate-to-severe stroke was more represented in cohort-2020 (17.8% vs 6.2%, p = .027). Similar proportions of patients underwent reperfusion (45.9% in 2019 vs 53.4% in 2020), although a slight increase in combined treatment was detected (14.4% vs 25.4%, p = .05). Door-to-scan timing was significantly prolonged in 2020 compared with 2019 (28.4 ± 12.6 vs 36.7 ± 14.6, p = .03), although overall timing from stroke to treatment was preserved. CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 pandemic, TIA and minor stroke consistently reduced compared to the same timeframe in 2019. Longer stroke-to-call and door-to-scan times, attributable to change in citizen behavior and screening at hospital arrival, did not impact on stroke-to-treatment time.

The current review aimed to summarize the global clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients systematically and identify their diagnostic challenges to help the medical practitioners properly diagnose and for better management of COVID-19 patients. We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases for original articles containing clinical information of COVID-19 published up to 7th May 2020. Two researchers independently searched the databases to extract eligible articles. A total of 34 studies from 8 different countries with 10889 case-patients were included for clinical characteristics. The most common clinical symptoms were cough 59.6, fever 46.9, fatigue 27.8, and dyspnea 20.23%. The prominent laboratory findings were lymphocytopenia 55.9, elevated levels of CRP 61.9, aspartate aminotransferase 53.3, LDH 40.8, ESR 72.99, serum ferritin 63, IL-6 52, and prothrombin time 35.47%, and decreased levels of platelets 17.26, eosinophils 59.0, hemoglobin 29, and albumin 38.4%.

Animals are more likely to survive in a changing environment by adjusting their behaviour to repeatedly occurring but harmless stimulations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, starting in late 2019, face masks were recommended to the public to prevent the spread of pathogens. In this context, we compared the flight initiation distance (FID) of the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus), a commonly seen bird across China, in Yibin and Dazhou, Sichuan, in response to people with or without face masks. After continuous exposure to people wearing face masks for nearly six months, sparrows evidently became adapted to people wearing face masks, and correspondingly showed shorter FIDs in response to people wearing masks. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that birds show reduced fear responses to people wearing face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results suggest a novel aspect of short-term adaptation of wildlife to human behaviour, and that the learning ability of sparrows allows them to adjust their behaviours to adapt to such subtle changes in the environment.","Jiang, Xingyi; Liu, Jianping; Zhang, Changjie; Liang, Wei",Glob Ecol Conserv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01277; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989420308180?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351989420308180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32953948/,12

Methods. We evaluated care disruptions in a longitudinal cohort of non-metastatic breast cancer survivors ages 60-98 from five US regions (n=321). Survivors completed a web-based or telephone survey from May 27, 2020 to September 11, 2020. Care disruptions included self-reported interruptions in ability to see doctors, receive treatment or supportive therapies, or fill prescriptions. Logistic regression models evaluated bivariate and multivariate associations between care disruptions and education, medical, psychosocial and COVID-19-related factors. Multivariate models included age, county COVID-19 rates, comorbidity and post-diagnosis time. Results. There was a high response rate (n=262, 81.6%). Survivors were 32.2 months post-diagnosis (SD 17.5, range 4-73). Nearly half (48%) reported a medical disruption. The unadjusted odds of care disruptions were significantly higher with more education (OR 1.23 per one-year increase, 95% CI 1.09-1.39, p =0.001) and greater depression (OR 1.04 per one-point increase in CES-D score, CI 1.003-1.08, p=0.033); tangible support decreased the odds of disruptions (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97-0.99 per one-point increase, p=0.012). There was a trend for associations between disruptions and comorbidity (unadjusted OR 1.13 per 1 added comorbidity, 95% CI 0.99-1.29, p=0.07). Adjusting for covariates, only higher education (p=0.001) and tangible social support (p=0.006) remained significantly associated with having care disruptions. Conclusions.

With the increase of global migration, quantifying the health needs and key correlates of these outcomes is a global health priority. This study assessed migration characteristics, COVID-19 attitudes and the postmigration social environment as key correlates of depression, quality of life and alcohol misuse among international migrants in China. DESIGN: A nationwide cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 17 February and 1 March 2020. SETTING: Links to the online survey were disseminated by migrant-focused community-based organisations through WeChat. PARTICIPANTS: English speaking international migrants who met the inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were being born in a country outside of China, aged 18 years or over, cumulatively living in China for 1 month or more and staying in China between December 2019 and February 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, quality of life and alcohol misuse. RESULTS: Regression models indicated that planning or considering leaving China due to COVID-19, lacking the confidence to protect themselves and not being confident that the epidemic would end soon was associated with greater depression, lower quality of life and greater levels of alcohol misuse. Worry about contracting COVID-19 and feeling helpless to prevent infection were associated with greater depression and lower quality of life. General perceived social support, and trust in Chinese people, institutions and systems were protective factors for depression and associated with higher reported quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies key correlates that, if adequately addressed through public health outreach, may safeguard migrant well-being during a public health emergency. Trust in people and systems within the postmigration environment is an important consideration for future public health planning efforts.","Hall, Brian J; Zhao, Peizhen; Xiong, Ming Zhou; Latkin, Carl; Yang, Bin; Wang, Cheng",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33722876/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048012,12

But, do militaristic metaphors truly affect individuals' perceived threat of the COVID-19 virus and increase their support for corresponding restrictive policies? This study assessed the effects of fictitious newspaper articles that described COVID-19 policies using similarly negatively valenced metaphors but with differing militaristic connotations (e.g., ""war"" vs. ""struggle""). Overall, data from three framing experiments (N = 1114) in Germany and the United States indicate limited evidence on the effectiveness of the tested militaristic metaphors. In the U.S. context, the non-militaristic concept of struggle was consistently more strongly associated with the desired outcomes than militaristic metaphors were. In Studies 2 and 3, we also tested whether reporting using a narrative or straightforward facts had additional influence on the framing effect. A congruency effect of the use of a narrative and of warfare metaphors was found in the German sample, but not in that of the United States. Results of post-experimental norming studies (N = 437) in both countries revealed that the metaphor of war is associated with people ascribing greater responsibility to their governments, whereas the concept of struggle triggers a sense of individual responsibility.

Severe zinc depletion induces binding of mycobacterial protein Y (Mpy) to the 70S C− ribosome, thereby stabilizing the ribosome in an inactive state that is also resistant to kanamycin and streptomycin. Because the Mpy binding region on the ribosome is proximal to the binding pocket of spectinamides (Spa), the preclinical drug candidates for tuberculosis, we addressed the impact of remodeling and hibernation of ribosomes on Spa sensitivity. We report here that while Mpy binding has no significant effect on Spa sensitivity to the ribosome, replacement of S14(C+) with its C− counterpart reduces the binding affinity of the drug by ∼2-fold, causing increased Spa tolerance in Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells harboring the C− ribosome. The altered interaction between Spa and ribosomes likely results from new contact points for D67 and R83 residues of S14(C−) with U1138 and C1184 of 16S rRNA helix 34, respectively. Given that M. tuberculosis induces ribosome remodeling during progression from the acute to chronic phase of lung infection, our findings highlight new considerations in the development of Spa as effective drugs against tuberculosis.","Li, Yunlong; Koripella, Ravi K.; Sharma, Manjuli R.; Lee, Richard E.; Agrawal, Rajendra K.; Ojha, Anil K.",Antimicrob Agents Chemother,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01833-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33361293/,12

The race for a safe and efficacious vaccine was thus initiated with government agencies as well as major pharmaceutical companies as frontrunners. An ideal vaccine would activate multiple arms of the adaptive immune system to generate cytotoxic T cell responses as well as neutralizing antibody responses, while avoiding pathological or deleterious immune responses that result in tissue damage or exacerbation of the disease. Developing an effective vaccine requires an inter-disciplinary effort involving virology, protein biology, biotechnology, immunology and pharmaceutical sciences. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the pathology and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which are fundamental to vaccine development. We then summarize the rationale for developing COVID-19 vaccines and provide novel insights into vaccine development from a pharmaceutical science perspective, such as selection of different antigens, adjuvants, delivery platforms and formulations. Finally, we review multiple clinical trial outcomes of novel vaccines in terms of safety and efficacy.","Hofman, Kirk; Shenoy, Gautam N.; Chak, Vincent; Balu-Iyer, Sathy V.",Immunological investigations,https://doi.org/10.1080/08820139.2021.1904977; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33929280/,12

Recommendations on how to safely continue enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT) were provided. 135 of the 139 respondents during March 2020–June 2020 had Gaucher disease (GD). Twenty-six patients with GD endorsed 2 or more symptoms consistent with COVID19 infection and/or were confirmed to have COVID19 either through RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or through antibodies to the virus. The remaining 4 who had suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection were patients with Fabry (2), Pompe (1), and Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIA (1). This case series describes the impact of COVID19 on 30 patients with LSDs with details of symptomatology, duration of illness, and treatment. Baseline demographics were collected including age, sex, genotype, current disease burden, LSD treatment history, biomarkers and co-morbidities. At time of infection, 21 patients were on ERT (20 GD, 1 PD), 3 on SRT for GD, and 6 were naïve to therapy. There was only 1 hospitalization of a 55 year old woman with GD on ERT that resulted in ARDS who subsequently died due to SARS-CoV-2. Her co-morbidities included morbid obesity, COPD, hypertension and diabetes. Her GD burden was minimal. The rest of the affected patients had a mild to moderate COVID19 course. In conclusion, patients with LSDs experienced varied symptomatology and severity from COVID19 infection, ranging from asymptomatic to critically ill. Risk factors included baseline health status regardless of specific LSD, age, and associated co-morbidities.

Many entrustable professional activities have been written and published, but few studies describe the feasibility or implementation of entrustable professional activities in graduate medical education. The frozen section entrustable professional activit was introduced into the pathology residency training at the University of Vermont for postgraduate year 1 at the start of their training in frozen section. The feasibility of the entrustable professional activit was evaluated based on 3 criteria: (a) utilization, (b) support of frozen section training, and (c) generating data to support entrustment decision about residents’ readiness to take call. The entrustable professional activit was well utilized and satisfactory to residents, faculty, pathologists’ assistants, and Clinical Competency Committee members. Most members of the Clinical Competency Committee agreed they had sufficient data and noted higher confidence in assessing resident readiness to take call with the addition of entrustable professional activit to the residents’ assessment portfolio.

628451,The Economic Value of One Health in Relation to the Mitigation of Zoonotic Disease Risks,2012-07-04,"Abstract To study the role of the precursor to the membrane protein (prM) in flavivirus maturation, we inhibited the proteolytic processing of the Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus prM to membrane protein in infected cells by adding the acidotropic agent ammonium chloride late in the virus replication cycle. Viruses purified from supernatants of ammonium chloride-treated cells contained prM protein and were unable to fuse C6/36 mosquito cells from without. When ammonium chloride was removed from the cells, both the processing of prM and the fusion activity of the purified viruses were partially restored. By using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the envelope (E) glycoprotein of MVE virus, we found that at least three epitopes were less accessible to their corresponding antibodies in the prM-containing MVE virus particles. Amino-terminal sequencing of proteolytic fragments of the E protein which were reactive with sequence-specific peptide antisera or MAb enabled us to estimate the site of the E protein interacting with the prM to be within amino acids 200 to 327. Since prM-containing viruses were up to 400-fold more resistant to a low pH environment, we conclude that the E-prM interaction might be necessary to protect the E protein from irreversible conformational changes caused by maturation into the acidic vesicles of the exocytic pathway.","Guirakhoo, Farshad; Bolin, Richard A.; Roehrig, John T.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229290267S; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1280384/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229290267S,12

However, the adoption of web-based filling has been gradual, and the use patterns remain to be unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to estimate the trend and prevalence of web-based prescription-filling behavior and identify associated factors among adults in the United States. METHODS: We used data from the US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 2009 to 2018. Adult respondents (aged ≥18 years and over) self-reported their behavior of web-based prescription filling, which was defined as having filled a prescription using the internet in the past 12 months during the survey year. We reported trends using weighted percentages adjusted by the NHIS complex sampling design. We used descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression models to examine trends and identify factors associated with web-based prescription-filling behavior. RESULTS: The estimated number of adults reporting web-based prescription-filling behavior significantly increased from 13,319,877 (13,319,877/225,217,942, 5.91%) in 2009 to 28,308,262 (28,308,262/246,611,125, 11.48%) in 2018 (P<.001). Those who were more likely to report filling a prescription on the web were aged between 35 and 74 years, female, White, and frequent users of the computer or internet; these adults also reported higher education, higher income, insurance coverage, and poorer health status.

Government measures in response to the pandemic strongly restricted informal caregivers in providing help and care to persons with health‐related needs. At the same time, formal care was scaled back and informal caregivers' urge to help their loved ones was likely higher than before the pandemic. Generally, women pick up a larger share of informal care and experience more caregiver burden. We assessed whether the COVID‐19 pandemic affected the gender gaps in informal caregiving by analyzing unique data on Dutch informal caregivers (N = 1672 caregiving situations in 1196 respondents). Results showed that women, compared to men, were more likely to have stopped and reduced caregiving, but also to have cared more during the pandemic. Moreover, based on longitudinally comparing levels during and before the lockdown, we found that the gender gap in caregiver burden narrowed down, especially because burden decreased for women. This means that the caregiver burden was more equally distributed among women and men during the Spring 2020 COVID‐19 lockdown than before.","Raiber, Klara; Verbakel, Ellen",Gend Work Organ,https://doi.org/10.1111/gwao.12725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548767/,12

Such public health disruptions have resulted in significant collateral damage with particular implications for vulnerable populations, including the perinatal population. This Study aims to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian maternal and perinatal health care services. A questionnaire was designed to evaluate the COVID-19 impact on Italian maternal and perinatal healthcare facilities and their activities and provision of services from March to May 2020. The survey was completed by hospital-based and community-based Italian maternal and perinatal healthcare facilities. Most of these were located in Lombardy or Veneto (the most affected Italian regions). 70% of all facilities reported that the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively influenced the functioning of one or more aspects of the perinatal service; only 28.4% of facilities all over the country continued to provide outpatient routine visits and examinations as usual; 23.4% of facilities became understaffed during the index period due to various reasons such as ward transfer and sick leave. This is the first Italian study, and among very few international studies that describe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on antenatal and postnatal healthcare facilities and their provision of activities and services. Our findings confirm that healthcare systems even in high-income countries were not entirely prepared to handle such a global health emergency; indeed, specialized maternal and perinatal healthcare services have been disrupted by this global health emergency.","Cena, Loredana; Rota, Matteo; Calza, Stefano; Massardi, Barbara; Trainini, Alice; Stefana, Alberto",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.701638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34336776/,12
629860,Emotional representations of space vary as a function of peoples’ affect and interoceptive sensibility,2021-08-09,"Remdesivir is the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The active form of remdesivir acts as a nucleoside analog and inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is incorporated by the RdRp into the growing RNA product and allows for addition of three more nucleotides before RNA synthesis stalls. Here we use synthetic RNA chemistry, biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy to establish the molecular mechanism of remdesivir-induced RdRp stalling. We show that addition of the fourth nucleotide following remdesivir incorporation into the RNA product is impaired by a barrier to further RNA translocation. This translocation barrier causes retention of the RNA 3ʹ-nucleotide in the substrate-binding site of the RdRp and interferes with entry of the next nucleoside triphosphate, thereby stalling RdRp. In the structure of the remdesivir-stalled state, the 3ʹ-nucleotide of the RNA product is matched and located with the template base in the active center, and this may impair proofreading by the viral 3ʹ-exonuclease. These mechanistic insights should facilitate the quest for improved antivirals that target coronavirus replication.","Kokic, Goran; Hillen, Hauke S.; Tegunov, Dimitry; Dienemann, Christian; Seitz, Florian; Schmitzova, Jana; Farnung, Lucas; Siewert, Aaron; Höbartner, Claudia; Cramer, Patrick",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20542-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33436624/,12

This is true for virtually every aspect of a virus' replication cycle from virus entry to the budding or release of progeny virus particles. In this chapter, we will discuss new information on the impacts of virus-mediated manipulation of Dynein motor complexes and associated machineries and factors. We will highlight how these host cell components impact on pathogenicity and immune responses, as many of the virus-mediated hijacked components also play pivotal roles in immune responses to pathogen insult. There are several comprehensive reviews that define virus–Dynein interactions including the first edition of this book that describes how viruses manipulate the host cell machineries their advantage. An updated table is included to summarize these virus–host interactions. Notably, barriers to intracellular translocation represent major hurdles to viral components during de novo infection and during active replication and the generation of progeny virus particles. Clearly, the subversion of host cell molecular motor protein activities takes advantage of constitutive and regulated membrane trafficking events and will target virus components to intracytoplasmic locales and membrane assembly. Broadening our understanding of the interplay between viruses, Dynein and the cytoskeleton will likely inform on new types of therapies. Continual enhancement of the breadth of new information on how viruses manipulate host cell biology will inevitably aid in the identification of new targets that can be poisoned to block old, new, and emerging viruses alike in their tracks.","Milev, Miroslav P.; Yao, Xaojian; Berthoux, Lionel; Mouland, Andrew J.",Dyneins,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128094709000102; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128094709000102,12

We focused on using synthetic peptides for developing antibodies against SARS-CoV, which aimed to block viral invasion by eliciting an immune response specific to the native SARS-CoV S protein. Methods: Six peptide sequences corresponding to the surface regions of SARS-CoV S protein were designed and investigated by use of combined bioinformatics and structural analysis. These synthetic peptides were used to immunize both rabbits and monkeys. Antisera collected 1 week after the second immunization were analyzed by ELISA and tested for antibody specificity against SARS-CoV by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. Results: Four of our six synthetic peptides (S2, S3, S5, and S6) elicited SARS-CoV-specific antibodies, of which S5 (residues 788–820) and S6 (residues 1002–1030) exhibited immunogenic responses similar to those found in a parallel investigation using truncated recombinant protein analogs of the SARS-CoV S protein. This suggested that our S5 and S6 peptides may represent two minimum biologically active sequences of the immunogenic regions of the SARS-CoV S protein. Conclusions: Synthetic peptides can elicit specific antibodies to SARS-CoV.

Unlike many extant arguments for restricting, curtailing, or even eliminating intensive animal agriculture which focus on environmental harms, animal welfare, or the link between animal source food (ASF) consumption and noncommunicable disease, the argument in this article appeals to the value of protecting populations from future global health emergencies and their broad social, economic, and health impacts, taking the SARS-CoV-2 virus as a particularly salient example. The article begins by identifying how intensive animal agriculture contributes to the outbreak (and risk of future outbreaks) of zoonotic diseases. Next, we explore three specific policy options: 1. Incentivizing plant-based and cell-based ASF alternatives through government subsidies; 2. Disincentivizing intensive ASF production through the adoption of a “zoonotic tax”; and 3. Eliminating intensive ASF production through a total ban. We argue that all three of these measures are permissible, although we remain agnostic as to whether these measures are obligatory. We argue for this conclusion on the grounds that each measure is justified by the same sorts of considerations that justify other widely accepted public health interventions, and each is compatible with a variety of theories of justice. We then address potential objections. Finally, we discuss how our novel argument relates to extant ethical arguments in favor or curtailing ASF production and consumption.","Bernstein, Justin; Dutkiewicz, Jan",Food Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41055-021-00089-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33997264/,12

The significance of Ct values in epidemiological studies and large cohorts is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To monitor Ct values in a long-term study and compare the results with demographic data of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR. STUDY DESIGN: S gene SARS-CoV-2 Ct values were analyzed retrospectively from consecutive patients between March 15th to September 15th 2020 with special regard to age, gender, and in- or outpatient status. RESULTS: In total, 65,878 patients were tested, 1103 (1.7 %) of whom were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty-six positive patients were excluded, because the respective PCR runs did not meet the stability requirements (Ct value of the positive controls between 26 and 29). Of the remaining 1077 patients, females (n = 566; 53 %) were significantly older than males (n = 511; 47 %) (50.9 versus 45.1 years; p = 0.006) and had slightly higher mean Ct values than males (25.4 vs. 24.8; p = 0.04). Patients in the age groups >80 years had significantly higher Ct values than the remaining age groups (p < 0.001). Children (0–19 years) showed Ct values in the range of those found in adults (25.2 vs. 25.1, p = 0.9). There were no statistically different Ct values between in- and outpatients (p = 0.1), however, SARS-CoV-2 positive inpatients were significantly older than outpatients (p < 0.0001).

However, empirical studies, particularly those of migrants moving back to developing countries, have been limited due to the lack of education-specific migration flow data. Drawing on census microdata from IPUMS, we derive flow data by level of education and age group to quantify the level of return migration and examine the educational and age profile of return migrants for a global sample of 60 countries representing 70% of the world population. We show that return migrants account for a significant share of in-migration flows, particularly in Africa and Latin America, and, in all countries but six, return migrants are more educated than the population in the migrants’ country of birth. Our age decomposition reveals that young adults contribute the most to the positive educational selectivity of return migrants, particularly in Africa and Asia. While this paper does not quantify the net effect of return migration on education levels, it underlines the importance of the human capital contributions of young adult returnees.

631762,"An Interview with Michael Diamond, MD, PhD",2021,"The current life-threatening and tenacious pandemic eruption of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a significant global hazard concerning high mortality rate, economic meltdown, and everyday life distress. The rapid spread of COVID-19 demands countermeasures to combat this deadly virus. Currently, there are no drugs approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19. Therefore, discovering small molecule therapeutics for treating COVID-19 infection is essential. So far, only a few small molecule inhibitors are reported for coronaviruses. There is a need to expand the small chemical space of coronaviruses inhibitors by adding potent and selective scaffolds with anti-COVID activity. In this context, the huge antiviral chemical space already available can be analysed using cheminformatic and machine learning to unearth new scaffolds. We created three specific datasets called “antiviral dataset” (N= 38,428) “drug-like “antiviral dataset” (N=20,963) and “anticorona dataset” (N= 433) for this purpose. We analyzed the 433 molecules of “anticorona dataset” for their scaffold diversity, physicochemical distributions, principal component analysis, activity cliffs, R-group decomposition, and scaffold mapping. The scaffold diversity of the “anticorona dataset” in terms of Murcko scaffold analysis demonstrates a thorough representation of diverse chemical scaffolds. However, physicochemical descriptor analysis and principal component analysis demonstrated negligible drug-like features for the “anticorona dataset” molecules. The “antiviral dataset” and “drug-like antiviral dataset” showed low scaffold diversity as measured by the Gini coefficient. The hierarchical clustering of the “antiviral dataset” against the “anticorona dataset” demonstrated little molecular similarity. We generated a library of frequent fragments and polypharmacological ligands targeting various essential viral proteins such as main protease, helicase, papain-like protease, and replicase polyprotein 1ab. Further structural and chemical features of the “anticorona dataset” were compared with SARS-CoV-2 repurposed drugs, FDA-approved drugs, natural products, and drugs currently in clinical trials. Using machine learning tool DCA (DMax Chemistry Assistant, we converted the “anticorona dataset” into an elegant hypothesis with significant functional biological relevance. Machine learning analysis uncovered that FDA approved drugs, Tizanidine HCl, Cefazolin, Raltegravir, Azilsartan, Acalabrutinib, Luliconazole, Sitagliptin, Meloxicam (Mobic), Succinyl sulfathiazole, Fluconazole, and Pranlukast could be repurposed as effective drugs for COVID-19. Fragment-based scaffold analysis and R-group decomposition uncovered pyrrolidine and the indole molecular scaffolds as the potent fragments for designing and synthesizing the novel drug-like molecules for targeting SARS-CoV-2. This comprehensive and systematic assessment of small-molecule viral therapeutics' entire chemical space realised critical insights to potentially privileged scaffolds that could aid in enrichment and rapid discovery of efficacious antiviral drugs for COVID-19.","Kumar, Abhinit; Loharch, Saurabh; Kumar, Sunil; Ringe, Rajesh P; Parkesh, Raman",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.12.028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037020305535?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2001037020305535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33391634/,12

The EMPOWER-SUSTAIN Global Cardiovascular Risks Self-Management Booklet(©) was developed for patients with Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), inspired by the CCM. Assessing usability of a self-management tool is important in chronic disease management. However, there was no available instrument to assess usability of a self-management booklet, as most instruments were developed to assess usability of mobile application. Therefore, this study aimed to adapt Skala Kebolehgunaan Aplikasi Mudah Alih (SKAMA) into the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN Usability Questionnaire (E-SUQ) and to determine its validity and reliability in assessing usability of a self-management booklet. A cross-sectional validation study was conducted among patients with MetS attending a university primary care clinic in Selangor, Malaysia. Content validation, adaptation and face validation of E-SUQ were performed according to recommended guidelines. It underwent two rounds of content validation as major revision was required for item 5. Subsequently, the revised E-SUQ was face-validated by 10 participants. Psychometric evaluation was conducted using principal component analysis with varimax rotation to determine the underlying structure of E-SUQ. Internal consistency reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s α coefficient and the test-retest reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC (2,k)). A total of 205 patients participated in the study. The item-level content-validity-index (I-CVI) for item 5 improved from 0.57 to 1.0 after the second round of content validation. The final S-CVI/Ave value for ESUQ was >0.90. The item-level face-validity-index (I-FVI) ranged between 0.9 and 1.0. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value of 0.871 and Bartlett’s test of sphericity p-value of <0.05 indicated good sample adequacy for factor analysis. Two factors with eigenvalues of >1 were extracted according to the Kaiser’s Criteria. The two extracted factors explained 60.6% of the cumulative percentage of variance. The elbow of the scree plot occurred between the second and third component, suggesting two factors to be retained. The two factors were consistent with “Positive” and “Negative” tone model. The overall Cronbach’s α coefficient was 0.77, indicating good internal reliability. The overall ICC was 0.85, indicating good reproducibility. The E-SUQ is shown to be valid, reliable and stable to measure the usability of a self-management booklet among patients with MetS in a university primary care clinic in Malaysia.","Sahar, Nurul Hidayatullaila; Badlishah-Sham, Siti Fatimah; Ramli, Anis Safura",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502011/,12
634493,A model of endemic coronavirus infections,2020-11-12,"This study explored the experiences of mentors to youth during the early months of the COVID‐19 pandemic. The study aims were to examine (1) the role of the pandemic on mentor–mentee interactions and relationships and (2) the ways in which mentors could be supported during the health crisis to better meet youth needs. Six online focus groups were conducted with 39 mentors. Mentor participants included 26 females and 11 males (two did not disclose gender), and 51% identified as white. Any mentor currently in a mentoring relationship, regardless of type, was eligible. Using Facebook groups, moderators posted questions and prompts, and mentor participants responded using textual comments. The text from each group was recorded, extracted, and coded and analyzed using thematic analysis. As mentors transitioned to a primarily online format, text and video chat became the most common communication methods. Mentees’ access to technology and privacy were the biggest challenges faced. Mentor concerns for their mentees varied, including mental health, school, family finances, and access to instrumental support and food. Mentor help involved routinely connecting with mentees and providing academic support. Mentors requested ideas and resources for connecting with mentees and an online mentor support group. During the early weeks of the pandemic, mentors continued to engage with mentees, offering valuable support during a confusing and scary time. Mentoring programs can broaden their approach, intentionally integrating online connecting in an effort to provide safe, appropriate, and continued support to both mentors and mentees.","Kaufman, Michelle R.; Wright, Kate; Simon, Jeannette; Edwards, Giselle; Thrul, Johannes; DuBois, David L.",Am J Community Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34318506/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ajcp.12543,12

To assist with the establishment of measures for the strategic planning to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, we present the first Brazilian geographic study with the aims to examine active hand emerging space-time clusters of COVID-19. We examine the associations between clusters and mortality rate, vulnerability, and social inequality. We used the prospective space-time scan statistic to detect daily COVID-19 clusters and examine the relative risk from February 25th-June 7th, 2020 in 5,570 Brazilian municipalities. We apply a Spearman statistic to measure correlation between the relative risk of each cluster and mortality rate, GINI index, and social inequality. We detected 11 emerging space-time clusters of COVID-19 occurring in all Brazilian regions, with seven of them with a relative risk greater than one, and the highest in the Amapa state in the northern region of Brazil. We observed a positive and significant correlation between the relative risk and mortality rate, Brazilian Social Vulnerability Index, and GINI Index.

636439,Viruses and Endogenous Retroviruses as Roots for Neuroinflammation and Neurodegenerative Diseases,2021-03-12,"Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a neglected rodent-borne zoonotic virus distributed worldwide. Since serologic assays are limited to several laboratories, the disease has been underreported, often making it difficult to determine incidence and seroprevalence rates. Although human clinical cases are rarely recorded, LCMV remains an important cause of meningitis in humans. In addition, a fatal donor-derived LCMV infection in several clusters of solid organ transplant recipients further highlighted a pathogenic potential and clinical significance of this virus. In the transplant populations, abnormalities of the central nervous system were also found, but were overshadowed by the systemic illness resembling the Lassa hemorrhagic fever. LCMV is also an emerging fetal teratogen. Hydrocephalus, periventricular calcifications and chorioretinitis are the predominant characteristics of congenital LCMV infection, occurring in 87.5% of cases. Mortality in congenitally infected children is about 35%, while 70% of them show long-term neurologic sequelae. Clinicians should be aware of the risks posed by LCMV and should consider the virus in the differential diagnosis of aseptic meningitis, especially in patients who reported contact with rodents. Furthermore, LCMV should be considered in infants and children with unexplained hydrocephalus, intracerebral calcifications and chorioretinitis. Despite intensive interdisciplinary research efforts, efficient antiviral therapy for LCMV infection is still not available.","Vilibic-Cavlek, Tatjana; Savic, Vladimir; Ferenc, Thomas; Mrzljak, Anna; Barbic, Ljubo; Bogdanic, Maja; Stevanovic, Vladimir; Tabain, Irena; Ferencak, Ivana; Zidovec-Lepej, Snjezana",Trop Med Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed6020088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34070581/,12
636946,Identification of New Pathogens in the Intraocular Fluid of Patients With Uveitis,2010-08-05,"Coyotes (Canis latrans) are seasonally monestrous and form perennial pair-bonds. Breeding is dominated by each pack's alpha male and female, and both sexes share responsibility for territory defense and pup-rearing. They are also opportunistic predators on domestic livestock and pets. But while dominant adults have been implicated as primary killers, depredation is reduced when coyotes are without pups. Contraception, therefore, may represent a non-lethal solution for conflicts between coyotes and humans. Steroid hormones successfully control fertility in some species, but have been considered contraindicated in wildlife and canids in particular; specific concerns include possible induction of aberrant behavior, or uterine and hematopoietic pathologies. Herein we describe a study examining the physiological effectiveness, health safety, and behavioral consequences following treatment of estrous coyotes with exogenous estrogen. We treated captive adult female coyotes in estrus with 0.01 mg/kg estradiol benzoate (EB), either before (n = 5) or immediately after ovulation (n = 6), then documented reproductive outcome, physiological variables and behavioral responses, during and after treatment. Pregnancy was averted in six females treated after ovulation, suggesting that appropriate timing of treatment proved crucial. A transient suppression of sexual behavior was observed, and in some cases, estrus appeared slightly lengthened. However, neither ovulation nor mating behavior was fully suppressed. Importantly, non-pregnant females (and their mates) displayed diestrous socio-sexual behavior similar to pregnant coyotes (behavioral pseudopregnancy). Furthermore, non-pregnant coyotes did not mate again until the next native breeding season, and we observed no deleterious physiological effects during diestrus or subsequent ovarian cycles.","Carlson, Debra A.; Gese, Eric M.",Anim Reprod Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378432009001377; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378432009001377; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2009.05.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19523776/,12

We found that Halyard H300 material used for wrapping of surgical instruments and routinely available in hospitals, met these criteria. Specifically, three layers of material achieved a filter efficiency of 94%, 99%, and 100% for 0.3 μm, 0.5 μm, and 3.0 μm particles, respectively; importantly, these values are close to the efficiency provided by FFP2 and N95 masks. After re-sterilization up to 5 times, the filter’s efficiency remains sufficiently high for use as an FFP1 respirator mask. Finally, using only one layer of the material satisfies the criteria for use as a ‘surgical mask’. This material can therefore be used to help protect hospital staff and other healthcare professionals who require access to high quality masks but lack commercially available solutions.","Oude Vrielink, Timo J.

AIM: To evaluate the scientific publications available on the relationship between COVID-19 and anxiety experienced in the general population, during the period of social isolation, adopted by governmental organizations and public health policymakers as a measure to contain the spread of cases. METHODS: A literature search was performed systematically exploring the PubMed and Medline databases using the following terms classified as MeSH descriptors: (“anxiety” AND “pandemic” AND “COVID-19”). For the search, in the Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde – BVS, Science.gov, Web of Science and National Library platforms, the following keywords were used: (""anxiety"" AND ""coronavirus"" AND ""social isolation""). Thirty-seven peer-reviewed articles were found. PRISMA and the Downs & Black checklist were used for qualitative evaluation. RESULTS: After applying the inclusion criteria, seven (n = 7) original scientific articles were selected. The collated evidence demonstrated increased levels of symptoms of anxiety and depression during the period of social isolation. The population between 21 to 40 years was most affected. The risk of severe depression was twice as high at the epicenter of the pandemic. Sleep quality was significantly impaired. Questions about politics, religion, and consumption of products from China were found to generate fear and anticipate probable changes in the pattern of post-pandemic consumption. Social isolation exacerbated feelings of extreme hopelessness, sadness, loneliness and suicidal ideation. CONCLUSION: We conclude that there is a potential relationship between social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and symptoms of anxiety. It is important to note that the direct and indirect costs of not identifying the detrimental effects of this phenomenon and neglecting strategies for intervention could lead to a significant psychological burden on society in several aspects after social isolation.","dos Santos, Erlene Roberta Ribeiro; Silva de Paula, Jose Lucas; Tardieux, Felipe Maia; Costa-e-Silva, Vânia Nazaré; Lal, Amos; Leite, Antonio Flaudiano Bem",World J Clin Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34616809/; https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i25.7433,12

BACKGROUND: Concern exists that mild coronavirus disease 2019 may cause myocardial and vascular disease. METHODS: Participants were recruited from COVIDsortium, a 3-hospital prospective study of 731 health care workers who underwent first-wave weekly symptom, polymerase chain reaction, and serology assessment over 4 months, with seroconversion in 21.5% (n = 157). At 6 months post-infection, 74 seropositive and 75 age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched seronegative control subjects were recruited for cardiovascular phenotyping (comprehensive phantom-calibrated cardiovascular magnetic resonance and blood biomarkers). Analysis was blinded, using objective artificial intelligence analytics where available. RESULTS: A total of 149 subjects (mean age 37 years, range 18 to 63 years, 58% women) were recruited. Seropositive infections had been mild with case definition, noncase definition, and asymptomatic disease in 45 (61%), 18 (24%), and 11 (15%), respectively, with 1 person hospitalized (for 2 days). Between seropositive and seronegative groups, there were no differences in cardiac structure (left ventricular volumes, mass, atrial area), function (ejection fraction, global longitudinal shortening, aortic distensibility), tissue characterization (T(1), T(2), extracellular volume fraction mapping, late gadolinium enhancement) or biomarkers (troponin, N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide). With abnormal defined by the 75 seronegatives (2 SDs from mean, e.g., ejection fraction <54%, septal T(1) >1,072 ms, septal T(2) >52.4 ms), individuals had abnormalities including reduced ejection fraction (n = 2, minimum 50%), T(1) elevation (n = 6), T(2) elevation (n = 9), late gadolinium enhancement (n = 13, median 1%, max 5% of myocardium), biomarker elevation (borderline troponin elevation in 4; all N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide normal).

640728,Potential role of viral metagenomics as a surveillance tool for the early detection of emerging novel pathogens,2020-11-11,"The use of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) devices has significantly increased in the last decades. Despite medical and technological advancements, a main challenge in the ECLS field remains the complex interaction between the human body, blood, and artificial materials. Indeed, blood exposure to artificial surfaces generates an unbalanced activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to hemorrhagic and thrombotic events. Over time, several anticoagulation and coatings methods have been introduced to address this problem. This narrative review summarizes trends, advantages, and disadvantages of anticoagulation and coating methods used in the ECLS field. Evidence was collected through a PubMed search and reference scanning. A group of experts was convened to openly discuss the retrieved references. Clinical practice in ECLS is still based on the large use of unfractionated heparin and, as an alternative in case of contraindications, nafamostat mesilate, bivalirudin, and argatroban. Other anticoagulation methods are under investigation, but none is about to enter the clinical routine. From an engineering point of view, material modifications have focused on commercially available biomimetic and biopassive surfaces and on the development of endothelialized surfaces. Biocompatible and bio-hybrid materials not requiring combined systemic anticoagulation should be the future goal, but intense efforts are still required to fulfill this purpose.","Willers, Anne; Arens, Jutta; Mariani, Silvia; Pels, Helena; Maessen, Jos G.; Hackeng, Tilman M.; Lorusso, Roberto; Swol, Justyna",Membranes (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes11080617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34436380/,12
640921,Delivering the message: How a novel technology enabled the rapid development of effective vaccines,2021-09-24,"BACKGROUND: Plain chest radiograph (CXR), although less sensitive than chest CT, is usually the first-line imaging modality used for patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The relation between radiological changes in CXR and clinical severity of the disease in symptomatic patients with COVID 19 has not been fully studied and there is no scoring system for the severity of the lung involvement, using the plain CXR. AIM OF THE STUDY: Current COVID-19 radiological literature is dominated by CT and a detailed description CXR appearances in relation to the disease time course is lacking. We propose an easy scoring system (CO X-RADS) to describe the severity of chest involvement in symptomatic COVID 19 patients using CXR and to correlate the radiological changes with the clinical severity of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical manifestations and CXR findings were recorded in 500 symptomatic COVID-19 positive patients who were admitted to Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) COVID-19 designated facility Center from January to June 2020. The severity and outcome of the disease included: intensive care unit admission, need for oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation. and mortality rate. RESULTS: Most of our symptomatic patients (86.8%) had mild and moderate clinical manifestations. The remaining 13.2% had severe manifestations, including: fever, persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea, abdominal and generalized body pains. Based on our radiological scoring system (0 to 10) patients were distributed according to their CXR findings into different categories and according to our suggested (CO X-RADS) severity system into five categories (0 to IV). Patients with mild clinical manifestations showed low scoring in CXR (score 0 up to 4) and they represented 72% of our patients. Patients with moderately severe clinical manifestations showed mainly GGO (scoring 5 and 6) and represented about 14.8% of patients. Patients presented with severe clinical manifestations had obvious lung consolidations at the time of presentation with CXR scoring system ≥ 7 and represented about 13.2% of patients. CONCLUSION: We proposed a simple CXR reporting scoring system (CO X-RADS) to categorize COVID19 patients according to their radiological severity. This radiological score was correlated well with the clinical severity score of patients. We encourage other centers to test this scoring system in correlation with the clinical status of patients.

METHODS: A consecutive series of patients who underwent percutaneous tracheostomy under laryngosuspension were reviewed for outcomes. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia and laryngosuspension. An 8.5 oral endotracheal tube is inserted and the cuff is inflated in the supraglottis, allowing access to the whole trachea and subglottis. The tube is taped to the laryngoscope. A rigid endoscope is inserted in the endotracheal tube through a swivel connector connected to the tube and the ventilation circuit. Percutaneous tracheostomy kit is used to perform dilatational tracheostomy at the desired level of the trachea under direct visual endoscopic control. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients underwent percutaneous tracheostomy under laryngosuspension. Thirty-two cases were performed in an emergency after securing the airway with endotracheal intubation. In all other cases, tracheostomy was performed as a part of an elective procedure affecting the airway or in patients requiring prolonged ventilation. More than half of patients were considered high risk by virtue of one or more of the following: morbid obesity, prior neck surgery, prior neck radiotherapy, progressive head and neck cancer, or laryngotracheal stenosis. Complications occurred in seven cases.

The ongoing corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has not only adversely affected the global healthcare infrastructure, but has significantly impacted world economy, socio-political and cultural environment. There are 219 different types of viruses, known at present to be able to infect human beings. This number is just a tip of the iceberg, with the possibility of a substantial pool of undiscovered human viruses and millions of other virus species (which affect plants and non-human animals) that can be potentially infectious to humans as well. Throughout human history there have been numerous pandemics and disease outbreaks that have not only led to huge loss of life, but also hindered economic growth and development. Therefore, in this review article we wanted to highlight major viral pandemics that have occurred in the last two decades, to understand factors contributing to their emergence, transmission and suggest ways to curb future outbreaks.","Bhadoria, Pooja; Gupta, Gaurisha; Agarwal, Anubha",J Family Med Prim Care,https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_2071_20,12

Antibody detection methods are not considered suitable to screen individuals at early stages and asymptomatic cases. The diagnosis of COVID-19 using biomarkers and indicators at point of care level is much crucial. Therefore, it is urgently needed to develop rapid and sensitive detection methods which can target antigens. We have critically elaborated key role of biosensors to cope the outbreak situation. In this review, the importance of biosensors including electrochemical, surface enhanced Raman scattering, field-effect transistor and surface plasmon resonance biosensors in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 has been underscored.

The most common cause of AEP is idiopathic, but it can be associated with antidepressant medications like sertraline. A 76-year-old female presented to our ED with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. She had no history of smoking or prior lung disease. She did not improve after treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics so a trial of corticosteroids was initiated. Her work-up was negative for infectious or collagen vascular causes of the respiratory failure. She was diagnosed with AEP associated with sertraline. Her condition improved with corticosteroid therapy after discontinuation of sertraline. This case report highlights AEP as a possible adverse reaction of sertraline.

The primary immunological target is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. S is exposed on the viral surface to mediate viral entry into the host cell. To identify possible antibody binding sites not shielded by glycans, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of a 4.1 million atom system containing a patch of viral membrane with four full-length, fully glycosylated and palmitoylated S proteins. By mapping steric accessibility, structural rigidity, sequence conservation and generic antibody binding signatures, we recover known epitopes on S and reveal promising epitope candidates for vaccine development. We find that the extensive and inherently flexible glycan coat shields a surface area larger than expected from static structures, highlighting the importance of structural dynamics in epitope mapping.","Sikora, Mateusz; von Bülow, Sören; Blanc, Florian E.

METHODS: We examined the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 (Alpha) that arose in the United Kingdom and spread globally. We determined titres of spike glycoprotein-binding antibodies and authentic virus neutralising antibodies induced by B.1.1.7 infection to infer homotypic and heterotypic immunity. RESULTS: Antibodies elicited by B.1.1.7 infection exhibited significantly reduced recognition and neutralisation of parental strains or of the South Africa variant B.1.351 (Beta) than of the infecting variant. The drop in cross-reactivity was significantly more pronounced following B.1.1.7 than parental strain infection.

Firstly we study the effectiveness of general vaccination in the decreasing of the number of infected individuals using a traditional non structured SEIR model. Secondly we consider an age-structured SEIR model with 3 age groups (youngster, adult and elderly) and we analyze the current strategy in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, of focusing the vaccination on the elderly group. We conclude by showing this strategy to be mistaken and that a vaccination focusing on the age group of the adults would be much more efficient in decreasing the total number of infected individuals.","MARCHESIN, M.

The aim of this article is to present Zhejiang province’s experience of establishing an accurate and smart control mechanism for epidemic prevention and control and resumption of work and production using a ‘five-colour epidemic chart’. The number of confirmed cases, proportion of local cases, and occurrence of clustered outbreaks were used as evaluation indicators to calculate the county-level epidemic risk and were assigned different weight coefficients; the absence of cases for 3 and 7 consecutive days was used as the adjustment index. When the first chart was published on February 9, there were 1 very-high-risk, 12 high-risk, and 12 low-risk counties. Under the five-colour chart, Zhejiang began to adopt precise measures to prevent and control the epidemic and resume work and production. By February 24, the low-risk counties had expanded to 82, with no high-risk and very-high-risk counties. The epidemic situation in Zhejiang province has been effectively controlled.

When the demand for these protective tools is not satisfied by the companies supplying them, a scenario of shortages occurs, and new strategies must arise. One possible approach regards the disinfection of these pieces of equipment, but there are multiple methods. Analyzing these methods, Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) becomes an exciting option, given its germicidal capability. This paper aims to describe the state-of-the-art for UV-C sterilization in masks and filtering facepiece respirators. To achieve this goal, we adopted a systematic literature review in multiple databases added to a snowball method to make our sample as robust as possible and encompass a more significant number of studies. We found that UV-C’s germicidal capability is just as good as other sterilization methods. Combining this characteristic with other advantages makes UV-C sterilization desirable compared to other methods, despite its possible disadvantages.","Nicolau, Talita; Filho, Núbio Gomes; Zille, Andrea",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33807909/; https://doi.org/10.3390/polym13050801,12

The purpose of this research is to evaluate associations between workplace experiences during COVID-19, moral distress, and the psychological well-being of Canadian HCWs. Method: A total of 1383 French- and English-speaking Canadian HCWs employed during the COVID-19 pandemic were recruited to participate in an online survey. Participants completed measures reflecting moral distress, perceptions of organizational response to the pandemic, burnout, and symptoms of psychological disorders, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Results: Structural equation modeling showed that when organizational predictors were considered together, resource adequacy, positive work life impact, and ethical work environment negatively predicted severity of moral distress, whereas COVID-19 risk perception positively predicted severity of moral distress. Moral distress also significantly and positively predicted symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and burnout. Conclusions: Our findings highlight an urgent need for HCW organizations to implement strategies designed to prevent long-term moral and psychological distress within the workplace. Ensuring availability of adequate resources, reducing HCW risk of contracting COVID-19, providing organizational support regarding individual priorities, and upholding ethical considerations are crucial to reducing severity of moral distress in HCWs.","Plouffe, R.

645808,Vaccines for the prevention against the threat of MERS-CoV,2016-04-06,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has generated a global health crisis that needs well management of not only patients but also environments to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The gold standard RT-qPCR method is sensitive and rapid to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but does not answer if PCR-positive samples contain infectious virions. To circumvent this problem, we report an SDS-propidium monoazide (PMA) assisted RT-qPCR method that enables rapid discrimination of live and dead SARS-CoV-2 within 3 h. PMA, a photo-reactive dye, can react with viral RNA released or inside inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions under assistance of 0.005% SDS, but not viral RNA inside live virions. Formation of PMA-RNA conjugates prevents PCR amplification, leaving only infectious virions to be detected. Under optimum conditions, RT-qPCR detection of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 resulted in larger than 9 Ct value differences between PMA-treated and PMA-free groups, while less than 0.5 Ct differences were observed in the detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 ranging from 20 to 5148 viral particles. Using a cutoff Ct difference of 8.6, this method could differentiate as low as 8 PFU live viruses in the mixtures of live and heat-inactivated virions. Further experiments showed that this method could successfully monitor the natural inactivation process of SARS-CoV-2 on plastic surfaces during storage with comparable results to the gold standard plaque assay. We believe that the culture-free method established here could be used for rapid and convenient determination of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions in PCR-positive samples, which will facilitate better control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Hong, Wei; Xiong, Jin; Nyaruaba, Raphael; Li, Junhua; Muturi, Elishiba; Liu, Huan; Yu, Junping; Yang, Hang; Wei, Hongping",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149085; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721041577; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721041577?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34293609/,12

The aim of this observational, prospective study was to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies in solid cancer patients referred to the academic institution of the Marche Region, Italy, between 1 July and 26 October 2020 and to determine the accuracy of the rapid serological test. After performing 3767 GCCOV-402a rapid serological tests on a total of 949 patients, seroconversion was initially observed in 13 patients (1.4%). Ten (77% of the total positive) were IgG-positive, 1 (8%) were IgM-positive and 2 (15%) IgM-positive/IgG-positive. However, only 7 out of 13 were confirmed as positive at the reference serological test (true positives), thus seroprevalence after cross-checking was 0.7%. No false negatives were reported. The kappa value of the consistency analysis was 0.71. Due to rapid serological test high false positive rate, its role in assessing seroconversion rate is limited, and the standard serological tests should remain the gold standard. However, as rapid test negative predictive value is high, GCCOV-402a may instead be useful to monitor patient immunity over time, thus helping to assist ongoing vaccination programs.","Cantini, Luca; Bastianelli, Lucia; Lupi, Alessio; Pinterpe, Giada; Pecci, Federica; Belletti, Giovanni; Stoico, Rosa; Vitarelli, Francesca; Moretti, Marco; Onori, Nicoletta; Giampieri, Riccardo; Rocchi, Marco Bruno Luigi; Berardi, Rossana",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33916569/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10071503,12

Methods: OCD symptoms, moderate/high stress, likely generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and likely major depressive disorder (MDD) were assessed with the Brief Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (BOCS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale, respectively. Results: Out of 32,805 individuals subscribed to Text4Hope, 6041 completed an online survey; the response rate was 18.4%. Overall, 60.3% of respondents reported onset of OCD symptoms and 53.8% had compulsions to wash hands during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents who showed OCD symptoms only since the start of COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have moderate/high stress (z = 6.4, p < 0.001), likely GAD (z = 6.0, p < 0.001), and likely MDD (z = 2.7, p < 0.01). Similarly, respondents who engaged in compulsive hand washing were significantly more likely to have moderate/high stress (z = 4.6, p < 0.001) and likely GAD (z = 4.6 p < 0.001), but not likely MDD (z = 1.4, p = 0.16).

We report findings from a survey among HCWs in three counties in Kenya. METHODS: We recruited 684 HCWs from Kilifi (rural), Busia (rural) and Nairobi (urban) counties. The serosurvey was conducted between 30th July 2020 and 4th December 2020. We tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using ELISA. Assay sensitivity and specificity were 93% (95% CI 88-96%) and 99% (95% CI 98-99.5%), respectively. We adjusted prevalence estimates using Bayesian modeling to account for assay performance. RESULTS: Crude overall seroprevalence was 19.7% (135/684). After adjustment for assay performance seroprevalence was 20.8% (95% CrI 17.5-24.4%). Seroprevalence varied significantly (p<0.001) by site: 43.8% (CrI 35.8-52.2%) in Nairobi, 12.6% (CrI 8.8-17.1%) in Busia and 11.5% (CrI 7.2-17.6%) in Kilifi. In a multivariable model controlling for age, sex and site, professional cadre was not associated with differences in seroprevalence.

Closely monitoring public engagement and perceptions of COVID-19 and preventive measures using social media data could provide important information for understanding the progress of current interventions and planning future programs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to measure the public’s behaviors and perceptions regarding COVID-19 and its effects on daily life during 5 months of the pandemic. METHODS: Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms were used to identify COVID-19–related and unrelated topics in over 300 million online data sources from June 15 to November 15, 2020. Posts in the sample were geotagged by NetBase, a third-party data provider, and sensitivity and positive predictive value were both calculated to validate the classification of posts. Each post may have included discussion of multiple topics. The prevalence of discussion regarding these topics was measured over this time period and compared to daily case rates in the United States. RESULTS: The final sample size included 9,065,733 posts, 70% of which were sourced from the United States. In October and November, discussion including mentions of COVID-19 and related health behaviors did not increase as it had from June to September, despite an increase in COVID-19 daily cases in the United States beginning in October. Additionally, discussion was more focused on daily life topics (n=6,210,255, 69%), compared with COVID-19 in general (n=3,390,139, 37%) and COVID-19 public health measures (n=1,836,200, 20%).

METHODS: All patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to the ICU between March 16th 2020 to May 10th 2020 were retrospectively studied. Patients were categorized in a AKI-group and a non-AKI-group. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included. Twenty-two (60%) patients developed AKI. Mortality in the AKI-group was 41% compared to 20% in the non-AKI group, p = 0.275. Comparable mortality was seen in the RRT (39%) and the non-RRT group (44%), p = 1.000. Renal function recovered to a KDIGO-stage 1 in 64% of the patients with AKI when discharged from the ICU.

However, the two most successful regional organisations, the European Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), have not been able to match the resolve of their individual member states, and there is a substantial gap between timely and robust national pandemic management and inadequacy at the regional level. This is a paradox that merits further investigation. To what extent and why diverged early national and early regional responses to COVID-19? This article identifies a causal relationship between robust national pandemic management as a result of early securitisation and ensuing paralysis on regional level, a process which I call the ‘selffulfilling prophecy of realism’—a vicious cycle of national self-help responses paralysing regional cooperation. This article contributes early to the impact of COVID-19 on regionalism by analysing EU and ASEAN pandemic management efforts, investigating what has hindered or facilitated successful regional cooperation and identifying room for meaningful interregionalism.","Kliem, Frederick",Asia Eur J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33746661/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10308-021-00604-8,12

Regresses Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in a Methionine- and Choline-Deficient Diet-Fed Animal Model,2015-10-21,"BACKGROUND: Nonantibiotic alternatives providing local gut immunity have been recommended for managing calf diarrhea. ANIMALS: One hundred and two calves with diarrhea. HYPOTHESIS: Oral supplementation with immunoglobulins in calves with diarrhea will reduce time to resolution of diarrhea, number of treatment events, and mortality rate. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial. Calves were assigned into 1 of 3 groups. The treatment group was supplemented with 20 g of immunoglobulins in milk twice daily for 14 days. The placebo group was supplemented with 20 g of a product with similar nutritional value as the treatment group, but without immunoglobulins, in milk, twice daily for 14 days. The control group received no supplements. Medical treatments, time to resolution of diarrhea, and case fatality rates were compared. RESULTS: There was no difference in the proportion of treatment events (treatment, 79% versus placebo, 77% versus control, 71%) among groups (P = .69). The median time to resolution of diarrhea was not different between the treatment (10.5 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7, 13) and control (8 days; 95% CI, 5, 10) groups (P = .08) or between the placebo (6.5 days; 95% CI, 3, 9) and control groups (P = .89). Median time to resolution was shorter (P = .008) in the placebo compared to the treatment group (6.5 versus 10.5 days). Case fatality rates among groups (treatment, 12% versus placebo, 3% versus control, 3%) were not different (P = .36).

648833,DRodVir: A resource for exploring the virome diversity in rodents,2017-05-20,"Aberrant mucosal immunity has been suggested to play a pivotal role in pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most common form of glomerulonephritis worldwide. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causal pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a global concern. However, whether the mucosal immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 influences the clinical manifestations of IgAN patients remains unknown. Here we tracked the SARS-CoV-2 anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody levels in a cohort of 88 COVID-19 patients. We found that 52.3% of the COVID-19 patients produced more SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgA than IgG or IgM, and the levels of the IgA were stable during 4-41 days of infection. Among these IgA-dominated COVID-19 patients, we found a severe COVID-19 patient concurrent with IgAN. The renal function of the patient declined presenting with increased serum creatinine during the infection and till 7 months post infection. This patient predominantly produced anti-RBD IgA as well as total IgA in the serum compared to that of healthy controls. The analysis of the IgA-coated microbiota as well as proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, which was mainly produced in the intestine, reveals intestinal inflammation, although no obvious gastrointestinal symptom was reported. The mucosal immune responses in the lung are not evaluated due to the lack of samples from respiratory tract. Collectively, our work highlights the potential adverse effect of the mucosal immune response towards SARS-CoV-2, and additional care should be taken for COVID-19 patients with chronic diseases like IgAN.","Zhang, Zhao; Zhang, Guorong; Guo, Meng; Tao, Wanyin; Liu, Xingzi; Wei, Haiming; Jin, Tengchuan; Zhang, Yuemiao; Zhu, Shu",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.11.20247668; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247668v1?rss=1,12

At the time of writing, more than 1900 clinical trials are registered globally to assess the efficacy and safety of candidate therapeutics for COVID-19. The majority of these trials are designed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of candidate therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 to prevent death among populations of hospitalized patients with advanced disease. Yet, emerging epidemiological evidence now indicates that the majority of those infected with the SARS-CoV-2, while still infectious, experience minimal or mild disease symptomology. Like HIV and hepatitis C that pioneered treatment as prevention, there is a missed opportunity for trials of early pharmaceutical intervention for COVID-19 disease evaluating not only reductions in morbidity and mortality but also transmissibility. We discuss this clinical research gap within an historical context of viral treatment as prevention for HIV and hepatitis C, and comment on the challenges and opportunities for clinical research of candidate therapeutics for early COVID-19 disease.","Forrest, Jamie I.; Rayner, Craig R.; Park, Jay J.

The prevalence and severity of COVID-19 differ between sexes. To explain these differences, we analyzed clinical features and laboratory values in male and female COVID-19 patients. The present study included a cohort of 111 people, i.e. 36 COVID-19 patients, 54 sex- and age-matched common viral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, and 21 healthy controls. Monocyte counts, lymphocyte subset counts, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the peripheral blood were analyzed. Higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, monocyte counts, and CRP and ALT levels were found in male COVID-19 patients. Decreased lymphocyte subset counts and proportions were observed in COVID-19 patients, except for the CD3(+) and CD8(+) T cell proportions. The lower CD4(+) T cell proportions and higher CD8(+) T cell proportions were observed in male and severe COVID-19 patients and the differences were independent of estrogen level. The CD4(+) T cell proportion was negatively associated with the CD8(+) T cell proportion in male COVID-19 patients; this correlation was non-significant in females. Our work demonstrates differences between sexes in circulating monocyte counts and CD4(+) T cell and CD8(+) T cell proportions in COVID-19 patients, independent of estrogen levels, are associated with the clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients with high specificity.","Zhao, Guolian; Xu, Yazhou; Li, Jing; Cui, Xiaoli; Tan, Xiaowen; Zhang, Hongyue; Dang, Liyun",Biosci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20202074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33350432/,12

METHODS: Web-based discovery services (e.g., Google Scholar) and discipline-specific databases (e.g., PubMed) were queried for articles on the patient-physician relationship among marginalized cancer patients. The marginalized populations of interest included (1) race and ethnicity, (2) gender, (3) sexual orientation and gender identity, (4) age, (5) disability, (6) socioeconomic status, and (7) geography (rural/urban). Study screening and data extraction were facilitated through the Covidence software platform. RESULTS: Of the 397 screened studies, 37 met study criteria-most articles utilized quantitative methodologies (n = 28). The majority of studies focused on racial and ethnic cancer disparities (n = 27) with breast cancer (n = 20) as the most common cancer site. Trust and satisfaction with the provider were the most prevalent issues cited in the patient-physician relationship. Differences in patient-physician communication practices and quality were also frequently discussed. Overall, studies highlighted the need for increased culturally congruent care among providers. CONCLUSION: Results from this review suggest marginalized cancer patients face significant barriers in establishing culturally and linguistically congruent patient-physician relationships. Future studies should focus on the intersectionality of multiple marginalized identities and optimization of the patient-physician relationship.","Palmer Kelly, Elizabeth; McGee, Julia; Obeng-Gyasi, Samilia; Herbert, Chelsea; Azap, Rosevine; Abbas, Alizeh; Pawlik, Timothy M",Support. care cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195857/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-021-06382-8,12

However, success on this strategy depends not only on the timing of its implementation, but also on the relaxation measures adopted within each community. We developed a mathematical model to evaluate the impacts of the lockdown implemented in Hermosillo, Mexico. We compared this intervention with some hypothetical ones, varying the starting date and also the population proportion that is released, breaking the confinement. A Monte Carlo study was performed by considering three scenarios to define our baseline dynamics. Results showed that a hypothetical delay of two weeks, on the lockdown measures, would result in an early acme around May 9 for hospitalization prevalence and an increase on cumulative deaths, 42 times higher by May 31, when compared to baseline. On the other hand, results concerning relaxation dynamics showed that the acme levels depend on the proportion of people who gets back to daily activities as well as the individual behavior with respect to prevention measures. Analysis regarding different relaxing mitigation measures were provided to the Sonoran Health Ministry, as requested. It is important to stress that, according to information provided by health authorities, the acme occurring time was closed to the one given by our model.

In the current study, in vitro T lymphocyte activation measured by IFNγ release was significantly higher in B2 versus B19 haplotypes. AIV infection of macrophages was required to activate T lymphocytes and prior in vivo exposure of chickens to NP AIV plasmid enhanced responses to infected macrophages. This study suggests that the demonstrated T lymphocyte activation is in part due to antigen presentation by the macrophages as well as cytokine release by the infected macrophages, with B2 haplotypes showing stronger activation. These responses were present both in CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes. In contrast, T lymphocytes stimulated by ConA showed greater IFNγ release of B19 haplotype cells, further indicating the greater responses in B2 haplotypes to infection is due to macrophages, but not T cells. In summary, resistance of B2 haplotype chickens appears to be directly linked to a more vigorous innate immune response and the role macrophages play in activating adaptive immunity.","Collisson, Ellen; Griggs, Lisa; Drechsler, Yvonne",Dev Comp Immunol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145305X16302920; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145305X16302920; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2016.09.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27746172/,12
652119,Breathe—Your immune system is counting on it,2021-03-16,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a national lockdown in India from midnight on 25 March 2020, with conditional relaxation by phases and zones from 20 April. We evaluated the impact of the lockdown in terms of healthcare provisions, physical health, mental health and social well-being within a multicentre cross-sectional study in India. METHODS: The SMART India study is an ongoing house-to-house survey conducted across 20 regions including 11 states and 1 union territory in India to study diabetes and its complications in the community. During the lockdown, we developed an online questionnaire and delivered it in English and seven popular Indian languages (Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Telegu, Kannada, Bengali, Malayalam) to random samples of SMART-India participants in two rounds from 5 May 2020 to 24 May 2020. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the overall impact on health and healthcare provision in phases 3 and 4 of lockdown in red and non-red zones and their interactions. RESULTS: A total of 2003 participants completed this multicentre survey. The bivariate relationships between the outcomes and lockdown showed significant negative associations. In the multivariable analyses, the interactions between the red zones and lockdown showed that all five dimensions of healthcare provision were negatively affected (non-affordability: OR 1.917 (95% CI 1.126 to 3.264), non-accessibility: OR 2.458 (95% CI 1.549 to 3.902), inadequacy: OR 3.015 (95% CI 1.616 to 5.625), inappropriateness: OR 2.225 (95% CI 1.200 to 4.126) and discontinuity of care: OR 6.756 (95% CI 3.79 to 12.042)) and associated depression and social loneliness. CONCLUSION: The impact of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on health and healthcare was negative. The exaggeration of income inequality during lockdown can be expected to extend the negative impacts beyond the lockdown.","Raman, Rajiv; Rajalakshmi, Ramachandran; Surya, Janani; Ramakrishnan, Radha; Sivaprasad, Sobha; Conroy, Dolores; Thethi, Jitendra Pal; Mohan, V; Netuveli, Gopalakrishnan",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33468529/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043590,12

The objectives of the study were: (i) to compare training and recovery conditions before and during the isolation period in handball players according to gender and competitive level, and (ii) to analyse the impact of psychological factors during the isolation period. A total of 187 participants (66 women and 121 men) answered a Google Forms questionnaire about demographics, training, moods, emotional intelligence, and resilience sent using the snowball sampling technique. T-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare sport level and gender differences. Linear regressions were used to analyse the psychological influence on training. Handball players reduced training intensity (in the whole sample; p = 0.44), training volume (especially in professional female handball players; p < 0.001), and sleep quality (especially in professional male handball players; p = 0.21) and increased sleep hours (especially in non-professional female players; p = 0.006) during the isolation period. Furthermore, psychological factors affected all evaluated training and recovery conditions during the quarantine, except for sleep quantity. Mood, emotional intelligence, and resilience have an influence on physical activity levels and recovery conditions. In addition, training components were modified under isolation conditions at p < 0.001. We conclude that the COVID-19 isolation period caused reductions in training volume and intensity and decreased sleep quality. Furthermore, psychological components have a significant impact on training and recovery conditions.","Mon-López, Daniel; de la Rubia Riaza, Alfonso; Hontoria Galán, Mónica; Refoyo Roman, Ignacio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899526/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186471,12

In this study, we evaluate the association between public interest in hand osteoarthritis (OA) as determined by GT search volumes and healthcare usage related to hand OA. Methodology We compiled GT data from 2010 to 2017 for the following group of hand OA-related search terms: “hand osteoarthritis,” “hand arthritis,” “hand swelling,” “hand stiffness,” and “chronic hand pain.” Claims associated with hand OA codes were obtained from an administrative database (14.8 million patients) using International Classification of Diseases codes from 2010 to 2017. We performed trend analysis using univariate linear regression of GT data and hand OA claims. A month-by-month analysis of variation from yearly GT means was conducted for hand OA-related search terms. Results There was increased public interest in hand OA-related search terms from January 2010 to December 2017. Univariate linear regression of GT data for hand OA-related search terms compared with hand OA claims demonstrated a significant positive correlation (p < 0.001, r = 0.707). Peak public interest in hand OA-related search terms was observed in July, May, and June. Conclusions This study demonstrates the ability of GT to track healthcare use related to hand OA. Our data also add to the evidence for monthly variations in public interest related to hand OA.

The purpose of this study is to summarize the outcomes of patients with novel COVID-19 pneumonia (NCP) at our institution. Methods: In this single-center study, we retrospectively included 118 cases of NCP, from January 16, 2020 to February 4, 2020. The clinical outcomes were monitored up to February 11, 2020. The outcomes of NCP patients were phase summarized at our institution. Three kinds of responses to clinical treatment were defined and evaluated: 1) good, symptoms continually improved; 2) fair, symptoms not improved or relapsed; 3) poor, symptoms aggravated. The risk factors, including basal clinical characteristics, CT imaging features, and follow-up CT changes (no change, progress, and improvement) related to poor/fair outcomes, were also investigated. Results: Six patients were improved to no-emergency type, 2 remained the same, and 2 progressed to fatal type. Besides, 13 patients progressed from the common type group to the emergency group (3 in fatal type and 10 in severe type). Forty-two (35.6%) patients were discharged with a median hospital stay of 9.5 days (range, 4.0-15.0 days). Thus, the numbers in different responses were, 73 patients in good response group (4 emergency cases, 69 no-emergency cases), 28 in fair response group (3 emergency cases, 25 no-emergency cases), and 17 in poor response group (3 emergency cases, 14 no-emergency cases). No patient has died in our hospital to date. The median duration of progress observed from CT scans was 6 days (range, 2-14 days). The progression in abnormal imaging findings indicate a poor/fair response, whereas the alleviated symptoms seen from CT suggest a good response. Conclusion: Most cases are no-emergency type and have a favorable response to clinical treatment.

The virus was passaged 10 times in suckling mice and was designated the MB-67N strain. The pathogenesis of MB-67N was studied with various ages of mice and inoculation routes. All mice inoculated i.c. with a large dose of virus died regardless of age, although a smaller dose caused fatal infection only in suckling mice. By intranasal, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous inoculation, the virus also killed suckling mice under 16 days old, but not older mice, even with a large dose. The susceptibility of mice for the MB-67N strain was influenced by age and inoculation routes. High titres of virus were re-isolated from the brain of diseased mice after inoculation by any route, but not from other organs. Histologically, numerous areas of severe tocal necrosis were produced in the cerebral cortex. Specific immuno-fluorescence and numerous viral particles were found in the cytoplasm of nerve cells by immuno-fluorescence staining and electron microscopy. These findings indicate that the MB-67N propagates mainly in the central nervous system and nerve cells serve as a main target of virus replication.","Yagami, K.; Hirai, K.; Hirano, N.",Journal of Comparative Pathology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021997586900617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3546411/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0021997586900617,12

In this paper, I introduce a concept that I call age specific months of mortality, abbreviated MOMa, a statistic that will allow people to understand their risk of death within their age group. In a year without excess mortality, i.e. no pandemic, individual causes of death will add up to a total of 12 MOMa. Excess mortality, e.g. a pandemic, adds MOMa beyond 12. For people in their 20s, the MOMa is 5 for accidents, 1.9 for suicide, 1.6 for homicide, and 1.2 for Covid-19.

DESIGN: Rapid evidence map. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science, and COVID-19 specific databases offered by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included studies in human populations susceptible to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, SARS-CoV-1/severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus/Middle East respiratory syndrome or influenza. Interventions of interest were travel-related control measures affecting travel across national or subnational borders. Outcomes of interest included infectious disease, screening, other health, economic and social outcomes. We considered all empirical studies that quantitatively evaluate impact available in Armenian, English, French, German, Italian and Russian based on the team’s language capacities. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We extracted data from included studies in a standardised manner and mapped them to a priori and (one) post hoc defined categories. RESULTS: We included 122 studies assessing travel-related control measures. These studies were undertaken across the globe, most in the Western Pacific region (n=71). A large proportion of studies focused on COVID-19 (n=59), but a number of studies also examined SARS, MERS and influenza. We identified studies on border closures (n=3), entry/exit screening (n=31), travel-related quarantine (n=6), travel bans (n=8) and travel restrictions (n=25). Many addressed a bundle of travel-related control measures (n=49). Most studies assessed infectious disease (n=98) and/or screening-related (n=25) outcomes; we found only limited evidence on economic and social outcomes. Studies applied numerous methods, both inferential and descriptive in nature, ranging from simple observational methods to complex modelling techniques.

655085,Infections Associated with Retinal Autoimmunity,2015-02-06,"Background: COVID-19 could have even more dire consequences among refugees living in camps than in general populations. Bangladesh has confirmed COVID-19 cases and hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar with 600,000 concentrated in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site. Projections of the potential COVID-19 infection burden, epidemic speed, and healthcare needs in such settings are critical to inform preparedness planning. Methods: To explore the potential impact of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we used a stochastic disease transmission model with parameters derived from emerging literature. We considered three scenarios with different assumptions about the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. We estimated the number and daily rate of infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected under each scenario. Findings: A large-scale outbreak is highly likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp across scenarios with 65-95% of simulations leading to at least 1,000 infections. Estimated infections range from 119-504 between low and high transmission scenarios in the first 30 days; and between 424,798 and 543,647 in 12 months. Hospitalization needs exceeded the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 58-139 days between the low and high transmission scenarios. Estimated deaths range from 1,647-2,109 between low and high transmission scenarios. Interpretation: A COVID-19 epidemic in a refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring unrealistically large increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure.

Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a huge social and health challenge worldwide. Many different risk factors are associated with disease severity, such as systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, older age, and other co-infections. Other respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and smoking are common comorbidities worldwide. Previous investigations have identified among COVID-19 patients smokers and COPD patients, but recent investigations have questioned the higher risk among these populations. Nevertheless, previous reports failed to isolate smokers and COPD patients without other comorbidities. We performed a longitudinal evaluation of the disease course of smokers, former smokers, and COPD patients with COVID-19 without other comorbidities, from hospitalization to hospital discharge. Although no difference between groups was observed during hospital admission, smokers and COPD patients presented an increase in COVID-19-associated inflammatory markers during the disease course in comparison to non-smokers and former smokers. Our results demonstrated that smoking and COPD are risk factors for severe COVID-19 with possible implications for the ongoing pandemic.","Alberca, Ricardo Wesley; Lima, Júlia Cataldo; de Oliveira, Emily Araujo; Gozzi-Silva, Sarah Cristina; Ramos, Yasmim Álefe Leuzzi; Andrade, Milena Mary de Souza; Beserra, Danielle Rosa; Oliveira, Luana de Mendonça; Branco, Anna Cláudia Calvielli Castelo; Pietrobon, Anna Julia; Pereira, Nátalli Zanete; Teixeira, Franciane Mouradian Emidio; Fernandes, Iara Grigoletto; Duarte, Alberto José da Silva; Benard, Gil; Sato, Maria Notomi",Front Physiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.637627; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584342/,12

Numerous papers have been published in the last years on fungal polysaccharides, especially beta-glucans, demonstrating their various biological activities. However substantial data about beta-glucan contents in many mushroom species, especially wild mushrooms, are still missing. Therefore, the main objective of the study was to evaluate β-glucans in 18 species of wild mushrooms and three species of commercial mushrooms for comparison purposes. The contents of β-glucans were determined by the Megazyme method and with the Congo red method, which differ in analytical procedure. Among wild mushrooms, the highest mean β-glucan content assessed with the Megazyme method was found in Tricholoma portentosum (34.97 g/100 g DM), whereas with the Congo red method in Lactarius deliciosus (17.11 g/100 g DM) and Suillus grevillei (16.97 g/100 g DM). The β-glucans in wild mushrooms assessed with the Megazyme method were comparable to commercial mushrooms, whereas β-glucans assessed with the Congo red method were generally higher in wild mushrooms, especially in Russula vinosa, L. deliciosus and S. grevillei. This study indicates wild mushrooms as interesting material for β-glucan extraction for food industry and medicinal purposes.","Mirończuk-Chodakowska, Iwona; Witkowska, Anna Maria",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17197299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33036263/,12

With the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) are the most immunogenic subunits, genetic diversity and antigenicity of S and N are key players in virulence and in vaccine development. AIM: This paper aims at identifying immunogenic targets for better vaccine development and/or immunotherapy of COVID 19 pandemic. METHODS: 18 complete genomes of SARS CoV2 (n = 14), SARS CoV (n = 2) and MERS CoV (n = 2) were examined. Bioinformatics of viral genetics and protein folding allowed functional tuning of NH2 Terminal Domain (NTD) of S protein and development of epitope maps for B and T cell responses. CONCLUSION: A deletion of amino acid residues Y144 and G107 were discovered in NTD of S protein derived from Indian and French isolates resulting in altered pocket structure exclusively located in NTD and reduced affinity of NTD binding to endogenous nAbs and disrupted NTD mediated cell entry. We therefore, proposed a set of B and T cell epitopes based on Immune Epitope Database, homologous epitopes for nAbs in convalescent plasma post SARS CoV infection and functional domains of S (NTD, Receptor Binding domain and the unique polybasic Furin cleavage site at S1/S2 junction).

This study therefore explored the effects of daily temperature and humidity on COVID-19 transmission and mortality in Lagos state, the epicenter of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Correlation analysis was performed using incidence data on COVID-19 and meteorological data for the corresponding periods from 9(th) March to 12(th) May, 2020. Our results showed that atmospheric temperature has a significant weak negative correlation with COVID-19 transmission in Lagos. Also, a significant weak negative correlation was found to exist between temperature and cumulative mortality. The strength of the relationship between temperature and the disease incidence increased when 1 week and 2 weeks' predetection delays were put into consideration. However, no significant association was found between atmospheric humidity and COVID-19 transmission or mortality in Lagos.

We aim to describe the incidence and outcomes of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) during this period as compared to non-pandemic period. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in a tertiary care hospital in Singapore. The study compared the incidence and outcomes of code blue activations over a 3-month period from March to May 2020 (COVID-19 period) with the same months in 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period). The primary outcome of the study was the rate of survival to hospital discharge for IHCA. The secondary outcomes included incidence of all code blue activation per 1000 hospital admissions, incidence of IHCA per 1000 hospital admissions. OUTCOMES: The rate of survival to hospital discharge for IHCA was 5.88% in the COVID-19 period as compared to 10.0% in the pre-COVID-19 period [odds ratio (OR), 0.72; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.26-1.95].

Small animal models that recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 disease are desperately needed to rapidly evaluate medical countermeasures (MCMs)(2,3). SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect wildtype laboratory mice due to inefficient interactions between the viral spike (S) protein and the murine ortholog of the human receptor, ACE2(4). We used reverse genetics(5) to remodel the interaction between S and mACE2 resulting in a recombinant virus (SARS-CoV-2 MA) that could utilize mACE2 for entry. SARS-CoV-2 MA replicated in both the upper and lower airways of both young adult and aged BALB/c mice. Importantly, disease was more severe in aged mice, and showed more clinically relevant phenotypes than those seen in HFH4-hACE2 transgenic mice. We then demonstrated the utility of this model through vaccine challenge studies in immune competent mice with native expression of mACE2. Lastly, we show that clinical candidate interferon (IFN) lambda-1a can potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human airway epithelial cells in vitro, and both prophylactic and therapeutic administration diminished replication in mice. Our mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 model demonstrates age-related disease pathogenesis and supports the clinical use of pegylated IFN lambda-1a treatment in human COVID-19 infections(6).","Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Leist, Sarah R.; Schäfer, Alexandra; Edwards, Caitlin E.; Martinez, David R.; Montgomery, Stephanie A.; West, Ande; Yount, Boyd L.; Hou, Yixuan J.; Adams, Lily E.; Gully, Kendra L.; Brown, Ariane J.; Huang, Emily; Bryant, Matthew D.; Choong, Ingrid C.; Glenn, Jeffrey S.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Sheahan, Timothy P.; Baric, Ralph S.",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854108/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2708-8,12

Here we report nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular modelling studies on the 9-O-acetyl esterase showing that the α-configured Neu5,9Ac(2) is strictly preferred by the INF-C and BCoV esterases. Interestingly, we have discovered that the INF-C esterase function releases acetate independently of the chemical nature of the aglycon moiety, whereas subtle differences in substrate recognition were found for BCoV esterase. Analysis of the apo and complexed X-ray crystal structure of INF-C esterase revealed that binding of 9-O-acetylated N-acetylneuraminic acids is a dynamic process that involves conformational rearrangement of serine-57 in the esterase active site. This study provides valuable insights towards the design of drugs to combat INF-C virus and coronavirus infections causing outbreaks of upper respiratory infections and severe diarrhea in calves, respectively.","Mayr, Juliane; Haselhorst, Thomas; Langereis, Martijn A.; Dyason, Jeffrey C.; Huber, Wolfgang; Frey, Barbara; Vlasak, Reinhard; de Groot, Raoul J.; von Itzstein, Mark",Glycoconj J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18196455/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10719-007-9094-4,12

These interactions range from the initial binding of viral coat proteins to host membrane receptor to the hijacking the host transcription machinery by viral proteins. Therefore, identifying PPIs between virus and its host helps understand the mechanism of viral infections and design antiviral drugs. Many computational methods have been developed to predict PPIs, but most of them are intended for PPIs within a species rather than PPIs across different species such as PPIs between virus and host. RESULTS: In this study, we developed a prediction model of virus-host PPIs, which is applicable to new viruses and hosts. We tested the prediction model on independent datasets of virus-host PPIs, which were not used in training the model. Despite a low sequence similarity between proteins in training datasets and target proteins in test datasets, the prediction model showed a high performance comparable to the best performance of other methods for single virus-host PPIs.

661042,Borna Disease Virus and the Brain,1998-01-30,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: COVID-19 impacts multiple organ systems and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Pathogenesis of viral infection, co-morbidities, medical treatments, and psychosocial factors may contribute to COVID-19 related neuropsychological and psychiatric sequelae. This systematic review aims to synthesize available literature on psychiatric and cognitive characteristics of community-dwelling survivors of COVID-19 infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Thirty-three studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria for review. Emerging findings link COVID-19 to cognitive deficits, particularly attention, executive function, and memory. Psychiatric symptoms occur at high rates in COVID-19 survivors, including anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disruption, and to a lesser extent posttraumatic stress. Symptoms appear to endure, and severity of acute illness is not directly predictive of severity of cognitive or mental health issues. The course of cognitive and psychiatric sequelae is limited by lack of longitudinal data at this time. Although heterogeneity of study design and sociocultural differences limit definitive conclusions, emerging risk factors for psychiatric symptoms include female sex, perceived stigma related to COVID-19, infection of a family member, social isolation, and prior psychiatry history. SUMMARY: The extant literature elucidates treatment targets for cognitive and psychosocial interventions. Research using longitudinal, prospective study designs is needed to characterize cognitive and psychiatric functioning of COVID-19 survivors over the course of illness and across illness severity. Emphasis on delineating the unique contributions of premorbid functioning, viral infection, co-morbidities, treatments, and psychosocial factors to cognitive and psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 is warranted.","Vanderlind, William Michael; Rabinovitz, Beth B.; Miao, Iris Yi; Oberlin, Lauren E.; Bueno-Castellano, Christina; Fridman, Chaya; Jaywant, Abhishek; Kanellopoulos, Dora",Curr Opin Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016818/; https://doi.org/10.1097/yco.0000000000000713,12

Design Analysis of SARS-Cov-2 infection-related gene expression from endometrial transcriptomic datasets. Setting Infertility research department affiliated with a public hospital. Patient(s) Gene expression data from five studies in 112 patients with normal endometrium collected throughout the menstrual cycle. Intervention(s) None. Main outcome measure(s) Gene expression and correlation between viral infectivity genes and age throughout the menstrual cycle. Result(s) Gene expression was high for TMPRSS4, CTSL, CTSB, FURIN, MX1, and BSG; medium for TMPRSS2; and low for ACE2. ACE2, TMPRSS4, CTSB, CTSL, and MX1 expression increased toward the window of implantation. TMPRSS4 expression was positively correlated with ACE2, CTSB, CTSL, MX1, and FURIN during several cycle phases; TMPRSS2 was not significantly altered across the cycle. ACE2, TMPRSS4, CTSB, CTSL, BSG and MX1 expression increased with age, especially in early phases of the cycle. Conclusion(s) Endometrial tissue is likely safe from SARS-CoV-2 cell entry based on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression, but susceptibility increases with age. Further, TMPRSS4, along with BSG-mediated viral entry into cells, could imply a susceptible environment for SARS-CoV-2 entry via different mechanisms.

661853,Soil-Transmitted Helminth Vaccines: Are We Getting Closer?,2020-09-30,"Coinfection by heterologous viruses in the respiratory tract is common and can alter disease severity compared to infection by individual virus strains. We previously found that inoculation of mice with rhinovirus (RV) 2 days before inoculation with a lethal dose of influenza A virus [A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8)] provides complete protection against mortality. Here, we extended that finding to a second lethal respiratory virus, pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), and analyzed potential mechanisms of RV-induced protection. RV completely prevented mortality and weight loss associated with PVM infection. Major changes in host gene expression upon PVM infection were delayed compared to PR8. RV induced earlier recruitment of inflammatory cells, which were reduced at later times in RV-inoculated mice. Findings common to both virus pairs included the upregulated expression of mucin-associated genes and dampening of inflammation-related genes in mice that were inoculated with RV before lethal virus infection. However, type I interferon (IFN) signaling was required for RV-mediated protection against PR8 but not PVM. IFN signaling had minor effects on PR8 replication and contributed to controlling neutrophilic inflammation and hemorrhagic lung pathology in RV/PR8-infected mice. These findings, combined with differences in virus replication levels and disease severity, suggest that the suppression of inflammation in RV/PVM-infected mice may be due to early, IFN-independent suppression of viral replication, while that in RV/PR8-infected mice may be due to IFN-dependent modulation of immune responses. Thus, a mild upper respiratory viral infection can reduce the severity of a subsequent severe viral infection in the lungs through virus-dependent mechanisms. IMPORTANCE Respiratory viruses from diverse families cocirculate in human populations and are frequently detected within the same host. Although clinical studies suggest that infection by multiple different respiratory viruses may alter disease severity, animal models in which we can control the doses, timing, and strains of coinfecting viruses are critical to understanding how coinfection affects disease severity. Here, we compared gene expression and immune cell recruitment between two pairs of viruses (RV/PR8 and RV/PVM) inoculated sequentially in mice, both of which result in reduced severity compared to lethal infection by PR8 or PVM alone. Reduced disease severity was associated with suppression of inflammatory responses in the lungs. However, differences in disease kinetics and host and viral gene expression suggest that protection by coinfection with RV may be due to distinct molecular mechanisms. Indeed, we found that antiviral cytokine signaling was required for RV-mediated protection against lethal infection by PR8 but not PVM.","Van Leuven, James T.; Gonzalez, Andres J.; Ijezie, Emmanuel C.; Wixom, Alexander Q.; Clary, John L.; Naranjo, Maricris N.; Ridenhour, Benjamin J.; Miller, Craig R.; Miura, Tanya A.",mSphere,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34160242/; https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00479-21,12

Despite support from Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, some patients may remain hypoxemic. One possible therapeutic procedure for these patients is the application of the prone position (PP). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of VV-ECMO on arterial oxygenation and compliance of the respiratory system in mechanically ventilated patients with refractory hypoxemia. The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of prone position for ECMO. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic records of all 23 COVID-19 patients on ECMO who were placed for the first time in prone position with an average duration of 16 h. Patient characteristics, pre-ECMO characteristics, changes in ventilator/ECMO settings and blood gas analysis before and after PP. RESULTS: A total of 23 position changes to prone position were performed. Oxygenation and respiratory compliance improved 16 h after adoption of prone position without any accidents during PP. CONCLUSIONS: The use of prone position during Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation demonstrated an improvement in oxygenation as well as lung compliance. It is a safe and reliable technique.","Oujidi, Younes; Bensaid, Amine; Melhoaui, Imane; Jakhjoukh, Dr Douaa; Kherroubi, Layla; Bkiyar, Houssam; Housni, Brahim",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34484734/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080121007196; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080121007196?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102769,12

Results: Phone call to 5619 patients were made with a lack of response of 19% The cases of 74% of the patients that answered were resolved virtually. There is a difference between units, obtaining a higher answering rate from patients appointed to specific clinic units, OR=0.60, or to general trauma ones, OR=0.67. The lowest answering rate was obtained from those derived from the emergency department. Twenty per cent of the consultations were not accompanied by complementary tests that would have favored the resolution in a single act. The general trauma consultations, OR=0.34, postoperative control, OR=0.49, and specific unit ones, OR=0.40, were the ones that better met this requirement. Out of the remaining patients, the general trauma consultations, OR=0.50, and those referred to units, OR=0.54, were the ones that had a higher resolution rate without in- person consultation. Conclusions: The cases of 74% of the patients who answered the phone call were resolved virtually Cases of 20% of the patients cannot be solved in a single act because they are derived without complementary tests. Osteosynthesis and postoperative arthroscopic follow-up consultations are the ones that need to be carried out in person the most.","Navas, Plácido Zamora",Rev Esp Cir Ortop Traumatol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.recot.2020.06.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S188844152030117X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S188844152030117X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33277229/,12

This is believed to result in an increased frequency of, and susceptibility to, infectious disease and to contribute to a wide range of non-communicable age-associated diseases in later life, especially cancer, cardiovascular disease, and autoimmunity. The majority of studies addressing immune ageing has been cross-sectional, but limited longitudinal studies are contributing to a better understanding of age-associated changes, as opposed to differences, and their clinical relevance. However, intriguing differences are emerging that implicate highly context-dependent immune ageing processes, mitigating against current generalisations concerning human immunosenescence and indicating the necessity for detailed comparisons of different populations, even those that would appear quite similar at first glance.","Pawelec, Graham",F1000Res,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.11297.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28868129/,12

The MeOH extracts of the fruits of the Paulownia tree yielded many small molecules capable of targeting PLpro. Five of these compounds were new geranylated flavonoids, tomentin A, tomentin B, tomentin C, tomentin D, tomentin E (1–5). Structure analysis of new compounds (1–5) by NMR showed that they all contain a 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran moiety. This chemotype is very rare and is derived from cyclization of a geranyl group with a phenol functionality. Most compounds (1–12) inhibited PLpro in a dose dependent manner with IC(50)’s raging between 5.0 and 14.4 μM. All new compounds having the dihydro-2H-pyran group showed better inhibition than their parent compounds (1 vs 11, 2 vs 9, 4 vs 12, 5 vs 6). In kinetic studies, 1–12 emerged to be reversible, mixed inhibitors.","Cho, Jung Keun; Curtis-Long, Marcus J.; Lee, Kon Ho; Kim, Dae Wook; Ryu, Hyung Won; Yuk, Heung Joo; Park, Ki Hun",Bioorg Med Chem,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089613002411; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089613002411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23623680/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2013.03.027,12

The purpose of this study is to empirically study the influencing factors of Chinese consumers on the food traceability system in the food safety field (hereinafter referred to as FTS). In this study, multiple models—push factor (information system success model), pull factor (ITM theory), mooring factor (TPB), and switching intention—were integrated into the push-pulling-mooring theory (PPM) to form a conceptual PPM comprehensive model framework to study the switching intentions of two-dimensional code traceability technology for dairy products of Chinese consumers. By collecting the questionnaire survey, 305 valid questionnaires were collected from the consumers of middle- and high-end dairy products in China, and the influencing factors of thrust, pull, and mooring force were identified. The results showed that 10 of the 11 hypotheses were positive, but the impact of perceived risk on user satisfaction was negative. The important value of this study is to conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of the key factors influencing consumer choice of traceable safe food through an integrated multi-model framework to help identify ways to establish and improve consumer willingness to use QR code traceable system products, to increase consumer confidence in the use of traceable and safe food choices.","Lin, Xin; Wu, Run-Ze",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.612889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519633/,12
668312,Introduction and Historical Perspective,2011-01-27,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the chest computed tomography (CT) findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to other non-COVID viral pneumonia. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched through April 04, 2020, for published English language studies. Studies were eligible if they included immunocompetent patients with up to 14 days of viral pneumonia. Subjects had a respiratory tract sample test positive for COVID-19, adenovirus, influenza A, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, or respiratory syncytial virus. We only included observational studies and case series with more than ten patients. The pooled prevalence of each chest CT pattern or finding was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: From 2263 studies identified, 33 were eligible for inclusion, with a total of 1911 patients (COVID-19, n = 934; non-COVID, n = 977). Frequent CT features for both COVID-19 and non-COVID viral pneumonia were a mixed pattern of ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation (COVID-19, 0.37; 0.17–0.56; non-COVID, 0.46; 0.35–0.58) or predominantly GGO pattern (COVID-19, 0.42; 0.28–0.55; non-COVID 0.25; 0.17–0.32), bilateral distribution (COVID-19, 0.81; 0.77–0.85; non-COVID, 0.69; 0.54–0.84), and involvement of lower lobes (COVID-19, 0.88; 0.80–0.95; non-COVID, 0.61; 0.50–0.82). COVID-19 pneumonia presented a higher prevalence of peripheral distribution (COVID-19 0.77; 0.67–0.87; non-COVID 0.34; 0.18–0.49), and involvement of upper (COVID-19, 0.77; 0.65–0.88; non-COVID 0.18; 0.10–0.27) and middle lobes (COVID-19, 0.61; 0.47–0.76; non-COVID 0.24; 0.11–0.38). CONCLUSION: Except for a higher prevalence of peripheral distribution, involvement of upper and middle lobes, COVID-19, and non-COVID viral pneumonia had overlapping chest CT findings. KEY POINTS: • Most common CT findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were a predominant pattern of ground-glass opacity (GGO), followed by a mixed pattern of GGO and consolidation, bilateral disease, peripheral distribution, and lower lobe involvement. • Most frequent CT findings of non-COVID viral pneumonia were a predominantly mixed pattern of GGO and consolidation, followed by a predominant pattern of GGO, bilateral disease, random or diffuse distribution, and lower lobe involvement. • COVID-19 pneumonia presented a higher prevalence of peripheral distribution, and involvement of upper and middle lobes compared with non-COVID viral pneumonia ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1007/s00330-020-07018-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Altmayer, Stephan; Zanon, Matheus; Pacini, Gabriel Sartori; Watte, Guilherme; Barros, Marcelo Cardoso; Mohammed, Tan-Lucien; Verma, Nupur; Marchiori, Edson; Hochhegger, Bruno",Eur Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07018-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32594211/,12

Unfortunately, information regarding their epidemiology is still limited in Peru. METHODS: A secondary data analysis was performed from a previous cross-sectional study conducted in children with a probable diagnosis of Pertussis from January 2010 to July 2012. All samples were analyzed via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the following etiologies: Influenza-A, Influenza-B, RSV-A, RSV-B, Adenovirus, Parainfluenza 1 virus, Parainfluenza 2 virus, Parainfluenza 3 virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. RESULTS: A total of 288 patients were included. The most common pathogen isolated was Adenovirus (49%), followed by Bordetella pertussis (41%) from our previous investigation, the most prevelant microorganisms were Mycoplasma pneumonia (26%) and Influenza-B (19.8%). Coinfections were reported in 58% of samples and the most common association was found between B. pertussis and Adenovirus (12.2%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of Adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and other etiologies in patients with a probable diagnosis of pertussis. Despite the presence of persistent cough lasting at least two weeks and other clinical characteristics highly suspicious of pertussis, secondary etiologies should be considered in children under 5 years-old in order to give a proper treatment.

This study evaluated the proportion and the maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among pregnant women with comorbidities. Participants were recruited consecutively in order of admission to a maternity for pregnant women with comorbidities. Sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory data were prospectively collected during hospitalization. Pregnant women were screened at entry: nasopharyngeal swabs were tested by RT-PCR; serum samples were tested for IgG antibodies against spike protein by ELISA. From April to June 2020, 115 eligible women were included in the study. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 28.7%. The rate of obesity was 60.9%, vascular hypertension 40.0%, and HIV 21.7%. The most common clinical presentations were ageusia (21.2%), anosmia (18.2%), and fever (18.2%). Prematurity was higher among mothers who had a SARS-CoV-2 infection based on RT-PCR. There were two cases of fetal demise. We found a high proportion of COVID-19 among pregnant women with comorbidities. This underscores the importance of antenatal care during the pandemic to implement universal SARS-CoV-2 screening, precautionary measures, and the rollout of vaccination programs for pregnant women.","Teixeira, Maria de Lourdes Benamor; da Costa Ferreira Júnior, Orlando; João, Esaú; Fuller, Trevon; Silva Esteves, Juliana; Mendes-Silva, Wallace; Carvalho Mocarzel, Carolina; Araújo Maia, Richard; Theodoro Boullosa, Lídia; Gonçalves, Cássia Cristina Alves; Frankel, Patrícia Pontes; Fragoso da Silveira Gouvêa, Maria Isabel",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34208954/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13071277,12

BACKGROUND The nursing profession, with the basic duty of caring for people, is among the professional groups most affected by COVID-19. The high rate of transmission of COVID-19, inadequate numbers of nurses for the increasing case numbers, inadequate personal protective equipment and increases in numbers of deaths negatively affected nurses, as they affected all health professionals. METHODS This research is phenomenological research. A parallel mixed design including quantitative and qualitative research methods was used in the research. A sociodemographic data form and metaphor perception related to the COVID-19 pandemic form were used for data collection. Responses of nurses to the open-ended metaphor questions were evaluated with descriptive analysis and content analysis using the document investigation method. RESULTS The research was completed with 227 nurses. Most of the nurses were employed in COVID-19 wards (68.3%), were not diagnosed with COVID-19 (65.2%) and had not lost any relatives to COVID-19 (59.0%). It was determined that the answers given by the nurses comprised 151 metaphors collected in 8 categories in total. CONCLUSION The results show that the metaphors mentioned by nurses involve hopelessness.

Por lo tanto, el objetivo de estudio consistió en explorar la posible asociación entre los niveles séricos de nitratos y la mortalidad de pacientes COVID-19. Diseño: Estudio observacional y prospectivo Ámbito: Ocho Unidades de Cuidados Intensivos (UCI) de 6 hospitales de las islas canarias (España). Pacientes: Pacientes COVID-19 ingresados en UCI Intervenciones: Se midieron los niveles séricos de nitratos al ingreso en UCI. Variable de interés principal: Mortalidad a los 30 días Resultados: Los pacientes fallecidos (n=11) comparados con los supervivientes (n=42) presentaron mayores APACHE-II (p<0.001), SOFA (p=0.004) y niveles séricos de nitratos (p=0.001). Los análisis de regresión logística mostraron una asociación entre los niveles séricos de nitratos al ingreso en UCI y la mortalidad a los 30 días controlando por SOFA (OR=1.021; 95% CI=1.006-1.036; p=0.01) o APACHE-II (OR=1.023; 95% CI=1.006-1.041; p=0.01). No encontramos diferencias en el área bajo la curva (ABC) para la predicción de mortalidad entre los niveles séricos de nitratos (ABC=83%; 95% CI=73-92%; p<0.001), APACHE II (ABC=85%; 95% CI=75-96%; p<0.001) y SOFA (ABC=78%; 95% CI=63-92%; p=0.005) con el método de DeLong.

Conclusiones: El principal nuevo hallazgo fue la asociación entre los niveles séricos de nitratos y la mortalidad de pacientes COVID-19 controlando por SOFA o APACHE-II; pero estudios de mayor tamaño muestral son necesarios para confirmar este resultado. Objective: Higher blood nitrate and nitrite levels have been found in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients than in healthy subjects. The present study explores the potential association between serum nitrate levels and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Design: A prospective observation study was carried out. Setting: Eight Intensive Care Units (ICUs) from 6 hospitals in the Canary Islands (Spain). Patients: COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Interventions: Determination of serum nitrate levels at ICU admission. Main variable of interest: Mortality at 30 days. Results: Non-surviving (n=11) compared to surviving patients (n=42) showed higher APACHE-II (p<0.001) and SOFA scores (p=0.004), and higher serum nitrate levels (p=0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed serum nitrate levels to be associated to 30-day mortality after controlling for SOFA (OR=1.021; 95%CI=1.006-1.036; p=0.01) or APACHE-II (OR=1.023; 95%CI=1.006-1.041; p=0.01). There were no differences in the area under the curve (AUC) for mortality prediction by serum nitrate levels (AUC=83%; 95%CI=73-92%; p<0.001), APACHE II (AUC=85%; 95%CI=75-96%; p<0.001) and SOFA (AUC=78%; 95%CI=63-92%; p=0.005) based on the DeLong method. The Kaplan-Meier analysis found patients with serum nitrates levels >68.4 μmol/l to have a higher mortality rate (hazard ratio=138.8; 95%CI=22.3-863.9; p<0.001). Conclusions: The main novel finding was the association between serum nitrate levels and mortality in COVID-19 patients controlling for the SOFA or APACHE-II scores, though larger studies are needed to confirm this observation.","Lorente, Leonardo; Gómez-Bernal, Fuensanta; Martín, María M.; Antonio Navarro-Gonzálvez, José; Argueso, Mónica; Perez, Alina; Ramos-Gómez, Luis; Solé-Violán, Jordi; Alberto Marcos y Ramos, José; Ojeda, Nazario; Jiménez, Alejandro",Med Intensiva,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0210569120303363?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33293102/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medin.2020.10.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0210569120303363,12

After extubation, she presented altered mental statethat required a differential diagnosis of encephalitis/meningitis secondary to SARS-CoV-2.CT and CT-angiography were normal, spinal fluid tests were non-specific, and magnetic resonance imaging reported posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (due to radiological features suggestive of white matter vasogenic edema affecting the parietal, temporal and occipital lobes, along with altered mental state) secondary to gestational hypertension. Eleven days after the cesarean section the patient began to develop hypertension that required treatment. PRES is associated with certain clinical (headache, altered mental state, visual disturbances and convulsions) and radiological (reversible changes in white substance mainly affecting the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes) characteristics suggestive of vasogenic oedema In pregnant SARS-CoV-2 patients, the differential diagnosis of hypertension and altered mental state is often extremely complicated because complementary tests can be normal and there is no immediate sign of peripartum hypertension. SARS CoV-2 genome sequencing in spinal fluid could have provided a definitive diagnosis, but the treatment would not have differed.","Pérez, Veronica López; Vicente, Javier Cora; Granados, Catalina Eugenia Echevarria; Vázquez, Maria Luisa Salcedo; Estol, Fernando; Cuesta, Maria Y Tebar",Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034935620301717; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redar.2020.06.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034935620301717?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33036761/,12

Most of these vaccines have received approval without being extensively whetted for their adverse effect and efficacy profiles. Most adverse effects have been mild, nonetheless, more serious thromboembolic events have also been reported. Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) can occur in predisposed individuals where an immune mediated reaction against hepatocytes is triggered by environmental factors. Vaccines are a very rare cause of AIH. We report two such cases of AIH triggered by COVID (Covishield) vaccination. While one patient made an uneventful recovery, another succumbed to the liver disease. Ours is the first report of Covishield vaccination related AIH and second ever after any form of COVID vaccination. We hope that our report does not deter COVID vaccination drives.

670973,Emerging infectious agents and the nation’s blood supply: responding to potential threats in the 21st century,2012-06-13,"SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have occurred on several nautical vessels, driven by the high-density contact networks on these ships. Optimal strategies for prevention and control that account for realistic contact networks are needed. We developed a network-based transmission model for SARS-CoV-2 on the Diamond Princess outbreak to characterize transmission dynamics and to estimate the epidemiological impact of outbreak control and prevention measures. This model represented the dynamic multi-layer network structure of passenger-passenger, passenger-crew, and crew-crew contacts, both before and after the large-scale network lockdown imposed on the ship in response to the disease outbreak. Model scenarios evaluated variations in the timing of the network lockdown, reduction in contact intensity within the sub-networks, and diagnosis-based case isolation on outbreak prevention. We found that only extreme restrictions in contact patterns during network lockdown and idealistic clinical response scenarios could avert a major COVID-19 outbreak. Contact network changes associated with adequate outbreak prevention were the restriction of passengers to their cabins, with limited passenger-crew contacts. Clinical response strategies required for outbreak prevention may be infeasible in many cruise settings: early mass screening with an ideal PCR test (100% sensitivity) and immediate case isolation upon diagnosis. Personal protective equipment (e.g., facemasks) had limited impact in this environment because the majority of transmissions after the ship lockdown occurred between passengers in cabins where masks were not consistently used. Public health restrictions on optional leisure activities like these should be considered until longer-term effective solutions such as a COVID-19 vaccine become widely available.","Jenness, Samuel M.; Willebrand, Kathryn S.; Malik, Amyn A.; Lopman, Benjamin A.; Omer, Saad B.",Epidemics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34438256/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755436521000402; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436521000402?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2021.100488,12

A significant reduction in elective life-changing surgeries has been witnessed in almost all affected countries. This study discusses an applicable and effective pre-operative assessment protocol that can be applied during the COVID-19 era. METHODS: Our study is a descriptive retrospective observational study that involves children with CHD requiring open-heart surgeries at our tertiary care centre between March and November, 2020. We reviewed the charts of eligible patients aged 18 years and below. We identified the total numbers of scheduled, performed, and postponed surgeries, respectively. A thorough description of the clinical and physical presentation of the postponed cases, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, is provided. RESULTS: Sixty-eight open-heart surgeries were scheduled at our centre between March and November, 2020. Three surgeries (4%) were postponed due to COVID-19. The three patients were asymptomatic COVID-19 cases detected on routine SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing. No symptoms of cough, chest pain, dyspnea, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anosmia, and ageusia were reported by our patients. All patients were afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Owing to the pre-operative assessment protocol that was implemented after the first case was detected, only three healthcare workers were at risk of COVID-19 transmission and were imposed to infectious evaluation and home quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: Adopting our discussed preoperative COVID-19 assessment protocol for CHD patients is an effective method to detect COVID-19 infections, optimise patient care, and ensure healthcare workers’ safety.","Younis, Nour K.; Zareef, Rana O.; Diab, Marwa A.; El Sedawi, Omar; El-Rassi, Issam M.; Bitar, Fadi; Arabi, Mariam",Cardiology in the young,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183089/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s1047951121002754,12

Tylophorine derivatives exhibit anti-cancer activities but their cellular targets remain unknown. We used a biotinylated tylophorine derivative to probe for the interacting cellular target(s) of tylophorine. Tylophorine directly binds to caprin-1 and consequently enhances the recruitment of G3BP1, c-Myc mRNA, and cyclin D2 mRNA to form a ribonucleoprotein complex. Subsequently, this tylophorine targeted ribonucleoprotein complex is sequestered to the polysomal fractions and the protein expressions of the associated mRNA-transcripts are repressed. Caprin-1 depleted carcinoma cells become more resistant to tylophorine, associated with decreased formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex targeted by tylophorine. Consequently, tylophorine downregulates c-Myc and cyclins D1/D2, causing hypophosphorylation of Rb and suppression of both processing-body formation and the Warburg effect. Gene expression profiling and gain-of-c-Myc-function experiments also revealed that the downregulated c-Myc contributes to the anti-oncogenic effects of tylophorine compounds. Furthermore, the potent tylophorine derivative dibenzoquinoline-33b elicited a similar effect, as c-Myc protein levels were also decreased in xenograft tumors treated with dibenzoquinoline-33b. Thus, tylophorine compounds exert anti-cancer activity predominantly by targeting and sequestering the caprin-1 protein and c-Myc mRNA associated ribonucleoprotein complex.","Qiu, Ya-Qi; Yang, Cheng-Wei; Lee, Yue-Zhi; Yang, Ruey-Bing; Lee, Chih-Hao; Hsu, Hsing-Yu; Chang, Chien-Chung; Lee, Shiow-Ju",Oncotarget,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25669982/,12
672255,Sorafenib induces autophagy and suppresses activation of human macrophage,2013-01-19,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal resuscitation involves a complex sequence of actions to establish an infant’s cardiorespiratory function at birth. Many of these responses, which identify the best action sequence in each situation, are taught as part of the recurrent Neonatal Resuscitation Program training, but they have a low incidence in practice, which leaves health care providers (HCPs) less prepared to respond appropriately and efficiently when they do occur. Computer-based simulators are increasingly used to complement traditional training in medical education, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic era of mass transition to digital education. However, it is not known how learners’ attitudes toward computer-based learning and assessment environments influence their performance. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the relation between HCPs’ attitudes toward a computer-based simulator and their performance in the computer-based simulator, RETAIN (REsuscitation TrAINing), to uncover the predictors of performance in computer-based simulation environments for neonatal resuscitation. METHODS: Participants were 50 neonatal HCPs (45 females, 4 males, 1 not reported; 16 respiratory therapists, 33 registered nurses and nurse practitioners, and 1 physician) affiliated with a large university hospital. Participants completed a demographic presurvey before playing the game and an attitudinal postsurvey after completing the RETAIN game. Participants’ survey responses were collected to measure attitudes toward the computer-based simulator, among other factors. Knowledge on neonatal resuscitation was assessed in each round of the game through increasingly difficult neonatal resuscitation scenarios. This study investigated the moderating role of mindset on the association between the perceived benefits of understanding the terminology used in the computer-based simulator, RETAIN, and their performance on the neonatal resuscitation tasks covered by RETAIN. RESULTS: The results revealed that mindset moderated the relation between participants’ perceived terminology used in RETAIN and their actual performance in the game (F(3,44)=4.56, R(2)=0.24, adjusted R(2)=0.19; P=.007; estimate=–1.19, SE=0.38, t(44)=–3.12, 95% CI –1.96 to –0.42; P=.003). Specifically, participants who perceived the terminology useful also performed better but only when endorsing more of a growth mindset; they also performed worse when endorsing more of a fixed mindset. Most participants reported that they enjoyed playing the game. The more the HCPs agreed that the terminology in the tutorial and in the game was accessible, the better they performed in the game, but only when they reported endorsing a growth mindset exceeding the average mindset of all the participants (F(3,44)=6.31, R(2)=0.30, adjusted R(2)=0.25; P=.001; estimate=–1.21, SE=0.38, t(44)=−3.16, 95% CI –1.99 to –0.44; P=.003). CONCLUSIONS: Mindset moderates the strength of the relationship between HCPs’ perception of the role that the terminology employed in a game simulator has on their performance and their actual performance in a computer-based simulator designed for neonatal resuscitation training. Implications of this research include the design and development of interactive learning environments that can support HCPs in performing better on neonatal resuscitation tasks.","Cutumisu, Maria; Ghoman, Simran K; Lu, Chang; Patel, Siddhi D; Garcia-Hidalgo, Catalina; Fray, Caroline; Brown, Matthew R G; Greiner, Russell; Schmölzer, Georg M",JMIR Serious Games,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33346741/; https://doi.org/10.2196/21855,12

In this scenario, deep learning techniques are applied to detect COVID-19 pneumonia in X-ray images, aiding a fast and precise diagnosis. Here, we investigate seven deep learning architectures associated with data augmentation and transfer learning techniques to detect different pneumonia types. We also propose an image resizing method with the maximum window function that preserves anatomical structures of the chest. The results are promising, reaching an accuracy of 99.8% considering COVID-19, normal, and viral and bacterial pneumonia classes. The differentiation between viral pneumonia and COVID-19 achieved an accuracy of 99.8%, and 99.9% of accuracy between COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. We also evaluated the impact of the proposed image resizing method on classification performance comparing with the bilinear interpolation; this pre-processing increased the classification rate regardless of the deep learning architectures used. We c ompared our results with ten related works in the state-of-the-art using eight sets of experiments, which showed that the proposed method outperformed them in most cases. Therefore, we demonstrate that deep learning models trained with pre-processed X-ray images could precisely assist the specialist in COVID-19 detection.","Vieira, Pablo; Sousa, Orrana; Magalhes, Deborah; Rablo, Ricardo; Silva, Romuere",Pattern Recognit,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2021.108081; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031320321002685; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320321002685?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149099/,12
674084,Cerebral Organoids—Challenges to Establish a Brain Prototype,2021-07-15,"OBJECTIVES The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019, known as COVID-19, has rapidly evolved to a global pandemic. This pandemic represents an unprece - dented public health issue not only for the general population but also for patients on the transplant wait list. Multiple organizations around the world have published recommendations for the proper conduct of transplant procedures, including donor and recipient screening and perioperative management. We investigated the efficacy of these new recommendations and the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the deceased donation rate, donor organ management, and the time from family consent to procurement. MATERIALS AND METHODS The characteristics of potential donors diagnosed with brain death between July 15, 2019, and November 18, 2020, were evaluated retrospectively. Demographic and clinical features, the time elapsed from the clinical diagnosis until confirmation, and rates of acceptance were recorded. Potential donors diagnosed with brain death before the pandemic and during the pandemic were compared according to these variables. RESULTS Within the study period, 40 patients were diagnosed with brain death: 13 before the pandemic and 27 during the pandemic. The organs from 2 donors were procured before the pandemic. Organs from 3 of 8 donors were procured during the pandemic (the organs from 5 of these 8 patients were not donated). The organ donation time was 8.5 ± 2.12 hours (minimum-maximum, 7-10 hours) in the period before the pandemic and 54 ± 11.53 hours (minimummaximum, 45-67 hours) during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The number of donors decreased significantly in our hospital during the pandemic and was similar to the overall rate in Turkey. The duration of the donation process has been prolonged, and strategies to improve rates of organ donation, including infection control, have become a focus of concern.","Caliskan, Gulbahar; Sayan, Ayca; Kilic, Isa; Haki, Cemile; Kelebek Girgin, Nermin",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34387157/; https://doi.org/10.6002/ect.2021.0090,12

675973,"Preventive replacement policies with time of operations, mission durations, minimal repairs and maintenance triggering approaches",2020-06-18,"Throughout spring and summer 2020, ozone stations in the northern extratropics recorded unusually low ozone in the free troposphere. From April to August, and from 1 to 8 kilometers altitude, ozone was on average 7% (≈4 nmol/mol) below the 2000–2020 climatological mean. Such low ozone, over several months, and at so many stations, has not been observed in any previous year since at least 2000. Atmospheric composition analyses from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service and simulations from the NASA GMI model indicate that the large 2020 springtime ozone depletion in the Arctic stratosphere contributed less than one‐quarter of the observed tropospheric anomaly. The observed anomaly is consistent with recent chemistry‐climate model simulations, which assume emissions reductions similar to those caused by the COVID‐19 crisis. COVID‐19 related emissions reductions appear to be the major cause for the observed reduced free tropospheric ozone in 2020.","Steinbrecht, Wolfgang; Kubistin, Dagmar; Plass‐Dülmer, Christian; Davies, Jonathan; Tarasick, David W.; von der Gathen, Peter; Deckelmann, Holger; Jepsen, Nis; Kivi, Rigel; Lyall, Norrie; Palm, Matthias; Notholt, Justus; Kois, Bogumil; Oelsner, Peter; Allaart, Marc; Piters, Ankie; Gill, Michael; Van Malderen, Roeland; Delcloo, Andy W.; Sussmann, Ralf; Mahieu, Emmanuel; Servais, Christian; Romanens, Gonzague; Stübi, Rene; Ancellet, Gerard; Godin‐Beekmann, Sophie; Yamanouchi, Shoma; Strong, Kimberly; Johnson, Bryan; Cullis, Patrick; Petropavlovskikh, Irina; Hannigan, James W.; Hernandez, Jose‐Luis; Diaz Rodriguez, Ana; Nakano, Tatsumi; Chouza, Fernando; Leblanc, Thierry; Torres, Carlos; Garcia, Omaira; Röhling, Amelie N.; Schneider, Matthias; Blumenstock, Thomas; Tully, Matt; Paton‐Walsh, Clare; Jones, Nicholas; Querel, Richard; Strahan, Susan; Stauffer, Ryan M.; Thompson, Anne M.; Inness, Antje; Engelen, Richard; Chang, Kai‐Lan; Cooper, Owen R.",Geophys Res Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33785974/; https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gl091987,12

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective survey. SETTING: Quaternary medical center and online survey. METHODS: The perceived chemosensory capacities of 655 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were assessed with 11-point category rating scales (0, no function; 10, normal function). Patients were contacted in hospital, by phone calls, or by internet regarding their ability to smell or taste, and 143 were interviewed by phone 1 to 4 months later to assess the recovery of their chemosensory abilities. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported olfactory, general taste, and taste quality–specific disturbances (sweet, sour, bitter, and salty) in the patients with COVID-19 were 82.4% (95% CI, 79.5%-85.3%), 76.2% (95% CI, 72.9%-79.4%), and 52.2% (95% CI, 48.3%-56.1%), respectively.

677117,Introduction to immunology at The University of Iowa,2014-05-24,"The desire to rid the blood supply of pathogens of all types has led to the development of many technologies aimed at the same goal—eradication of the pathogen(s) without harming the blood cells or generating toxic chemical agents. This is a very ambitious goal, and one that has yet to be achieved. One approach is to shun the ‘one size fits all’ concept and to target pathogen-reduction agents at the Individual component types. This permits the development of technologies that might be compatible with, for example, plasma products but that would be cytocidal and thus incompatible with platelet concentrates or red blood cell units. The technologies to be discussed include solvent detergent and methylene blue treatments—designed to inactivate plasma components and derivatives; psoralens (S-59—amotosalen) designed to pathogen-reduce units of platelets; and two products aimed at red blood cells, S-303 (a Frale—frangible anchor-linker effector compound) and Inactine (a binary ethyleneimine). A final pathogen-reduction material that might actually allow one material to inactivate all three blood components—riboflavin (vitamin B2)—is also under development. The sites of action of the amotosalen (S-59), the S-303 Frale, Inactine, and riboflavin are all localized in the nucleic acid part of the pathogen. Solvent detergent materials act by dissolving the plasma envelope, thus compromising the integrity of the pathogen membrane and rendering it non-infectious. By disrupting the pathogen's ability to replicate or survive, its infectivity is removed. The degree to which bacteria and viruses are affected by a particular pathogen-reducing technology relates to its Gram-positive or Gram-negative status, to the sporulation characteristics for bacteria, and the presence of lipid or protein envelopes for viruses. Concerns related to photoproducts and other breakdown products of these technologies remain, and the toxicology of pathogen-reduction treatments is a major ongoing area of investigation. Clearly, regulatory agencies have a major role to play in the evaluation of these new technologies. This chapter will cover the several types of pathogen-reduction systems, mechanisms of action, the inactivation efficacy for specific types of pathogens, toxicology of the various systems and the published research and clinical trial data supporting their potential usefulness. Due to the nature of the field, pathogen reduction is a work in progress and this review should be considered as a snapshot in time rather than a clear picture of what the future will bring.","Pelletier, J.P.R.; Transue, S.; Snyder, E.L.",Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16377551/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1521692605000745; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521692605000745,12
677463,COVID-19 and influenza: preparing for the storm,2020-07-07,"Detection of multiple viruses is important for global analysis of gene or protein content and expression, opening up new prospects in terms of molecular and physiological systems for pathogenic diagnosis. Early diagnosis is crucial for disease treatment and control as it reduces inappropriate use of antiviral therapy and focuses surveillance activity. This requires the ability to detect and accurately diagnose infection at or close to the source/outbreak with minimum delay and the need for specific, accessible point-of-care diagnosis able to distinguish causative viruses and their subtypes. None of the available viral diagnostic assays combine a point-of-care format with the complex capability to identify a large range of human and animal viruses. Microarray detection provides a useful, labor-saving tool for detection of multiple viruses with several advantages, such as convenience and prevention of cross-contamination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, which is of foremost importance in such applications. Recently, real-time PCR assays with the ability to confirm the amplification product and quantitate the target concentration have been developed. Furthermore, nucleotide sequence analysis of amplification products has facilitated epidemiological studies of infectious disease outbreaks and monitoring of treatment outcomes for infections, in particular for viruses that mutate at high frequency.

Methods We conducted a statewide population-level survey in Vermont from March 29-April 12, 2020, during the beginning of a statewide stay-at-home order. We utilized the USDA six-item validated food security module to measure food insecurity before COVID-19 and since COVID-19. We assessed food insecurity prevalence and reported food access challenges, coping strategies, and perceived helpful interventions among food secure, consistently food insecure (pre-and post COVID-19), and newly food insecure (post COVID-19) respondents. Results Among 3,219 respondents, there was a 33% increase in household food insecurity since COVID-19 (p<0.001), with 35.6% of food insecure households classified as newly food insecure. Respondents experiencing a job loss were more likely to experience food insecurity (OR 3.43; 95% CI, 2.45-4.80). Multiple physical and economic barriers, as well as concerns related to food access during COVID-19, are reported, with respondents experiencing household food insecurity more likely to face access challenges (p<0.001). Significant differences in coping strategies were documented between respondents in newly food insecure vs. consistently insecure households. Conclusions Since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant increase in food insecurity in Vermont, accompanied by major food access barriers.

This review discusses the pharmacological mechanisms of heparin regarding its anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory and direct antiviral activities, providing current evidence concerning the effectiveness and safety of heparin therapy for this major public health emergency.","Shi, Chen; Tingting, Wu; Li, Jin-Ping; Sullivan, Mitchell A.; Wang, Cong; Wang, Hanxiang; Deng, Bin; Zhang, Yu",Carbohydr Polym,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33357843/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0144861720314053; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144861720314053?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.117232,12
679076,Do we need a replacement medication for influenza with good efficacy?,2014-12-16,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread around the world, causing the disease COVID-19. To contain the virus, much hope is placed on participatory surveillance using mobile apps, such as automated digital contact tracing, but broad adoption is an important prerequisite for associated interventions to be effective. Data protection aspects are a critical factor for adoption, and privacy risks of solutions developed often need to be balanced against their functionalities. This is reflected by an intensive discussion in the public and the scientific community about privacy-preserving approaches. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to inform the current discussions and to support the development of solutions providing an optimal balance between privacy protection and pandemic control. To this end, we present a systematic analysis of existing literature on citizen-centered surveillance solutions collecting individual-level spatial data. Our main hypothesis is that there are dependencies between the following dimensions: the use cases supported, the technology used to collect spatial data, the specific diseases focused on, and data protection measures implemented. METHODS: We searched PubMed and IEEE Xplore with a search string combining terms from the area of infectious disease management with terms describing spatial surveillance technologies to identify studies published between 2010 and 2020. After a two-step eligibility assessment process, 27 articles were selected for the final analysis. We collected data on the four dimensions described as well as metadata, which we then analyzed by calculating univariate and bivariate frequency distributions. RESULTS: We identified four different use cases, which focused on individual surveillance and public health (most common: digital contact tracing). We found that the solutions described were highly specialized, with 89% (24/27) of the articles covering one use case only. Moreover, we identified eight different technologies used for collecting spatial data (most common: GPS receivers) and five different diseases covered (most common: COVID-19). Finally, we also identified six different data protection measures (most common: pseudonymization). As hypothesized, we identified relationships between the dimensions. We found that for highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19 the most common use case was contact tracing, typically based on Bluetooth technology. For managing vector-borne diseases, use cases require absolute positions, which are typically measured using GPS. Absolute spatial locations are also important for further use cases relevant to the management of other infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: We see a large potential for future solutions supporting multiple use cases by combining different technologies (eg, Bluetooth and GPS). For this to be successful, however, adequate privacy-protection measures must be implemented. Technologies currently used in this context can probably not offer enough protection. We, therefore, recommend that future solutions should consider the use of modern privacy-enhancing techniques (eg, from the area of secure multiparty computing and differential privacy).","Wirth, Felix Nikolaus; Johns, Marco; Meurers, Thierry; Prasser, Fabian",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33074833/; https://doi.org/10.2196/22594,12

Although most vaccine strategies have focused on systemic immunization, here we compared the protective efficacy of 2 adjuvanted subunit vaccines with spike protein S1: an intramuscularly primed/boosted vaccine and an intramuscularly primed/intranasally boosted mucosal vaccine in rhesus macaques. The intramuscular-alum–only vaccine induced robust binding and neutralizing antibody and persistent cellular immunity systemically and mucosally, whereas intranasal boosting with nanoparticles, including IL-15 and TLR agonists, elicited weaker T cell and Ab responses but higher dimeric IgA and IFN-α. Nevertheless, following SARS-CoV-2 challenge, neither group showed detectable subgenomic RNA in upper or lower respiratory tracts versus naive controls, indicating full protection against viral replication. Although mucosal and systemic protective mechanisms may differ, results demonstrate both vaccines can protect against respiratory SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In summary, we have demonstrated that the mucosal vaccine was safe after multiple doses and cleared the input virus more efficiently in the nasal cavity and thus may act as a potent complementary reinforcing boost for conventional systemic vaccines to provide overall better protection.","Sui, Yongjun; Li, Jianping; Zhang, Roushu; Prabhu, Sunaina Kiran; Andersen, Hanne; Venzon, David; Cook, Anthony; Brown, Renita; Teow, Elyse; Velasco, Jason; Greenhouse, Jack; Putman-Taylor, Tammy; Campbell, Tracey-Ann; Pessaint, Laurent; Moore, Ian N.; Lagenaur, Laurel; Talton, Jim; Breed, Matthew W.; Kramer, Josh; Bock, Kevin W.; Minai, Mahnaz; Nagata, Bianca M.; Lewis, Mark G.; Wang, Lai-Xi; Berzofsky, Jay A.",JCI insight,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.148494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33908897/,12

METHODS: Retrospective cohort of 103 patients hospitalized with COVID‐19. Demographic data, past medical history and hospital course were collected and analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to examine associations. RESULTS: From February 17th to April 5th, 103 consecutive patients were hospitalized with COVID‐19. Among them, 41 patients (39.8%) were admitted to the ICU and 29 (70.7%) required (IMV). The prevalence of obesity was 47.5% (49/103). In a multivariate analysis, severe obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m2) was associated with ICU admission (aOR 5.39; 95% CI:1.13‐25.64). Moreover, patients who required IMV, were more likely to have had heart disease (aOR 3.41; 95% CI:1.05‐11.06), obesity (BMI=30‐34.9 kg/m2) (aOR 6.85; 95% CI: 1.05‐44.82) or severe obesity (BMI≥35 kg/m2) (aOR 9.99; 95% CI:1.39‐71.69). CONCLUSION: In our analysis, severe obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m2) was associated with ICU admission, while history of heart disease and obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) were independently associated with the use of IMV. Increased vigilance and aggressive treatment of patients with obesity and COVID‐19 are warranted.","Kalligeros, Markos; Shehadeh, Fadi; Mylona, Evangelia K.; Benitez, Gregorio; Beckwith, Curt G.; Chan, Philip A.; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",Obesity (Silver Spring),https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32352637/,12

We aimed to review data of the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by analyzing all the published retrospective studies on the clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV. METHODS: We searched in four bibliographic databases PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science) for studies March 10, 2020 focused on the clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV for meta-analysis.

This study examined patient perceptions of telehealth in an outpatient SUD treatment program offering individual therapy, group therapy, and medication management. METHODS: Two hundred and seventy adults receiving SUD outpatient treatment were eligible to complete a 23‐item online survey distributed by clinicians; 58 patients completed/partially completed the survey. Data were summarized with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Participants were predominately male, White, and well‐educated. The majority (86.2%) were “very satisfied” or “satisfied” with the quality of telehealth care. “Very satisfied” ratings were highest for individual therapy (90%), followed by medication management (75%) and group therapy (58%). Top reasons for liking telehealth included the ability to do it from home (90%) and not needing to spend time commuting (83%). Top reasons for disliking telehealth were not connecting as well with other members in group therapy (28%) and the ability for telehealth to be interrupted at home or work (26%). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth visits were a satisfactory treatment modality for most respondents receiving outpatient SUD care, especially those engaging in individual therapy. Challenges remain for telehealth group therapy. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study examining patients' perceptions of telehealth for outpatient SUD treatment during the COVID‐19 pandemic by treatment service type.

Existing stochastic SIR models incorporate SSEs by fitting distributions with thin tails, or finite variance, and therefore predicting almost deterministic epidemiological outcomes in large populations. This paper documents evidence from recent coronavirus outbreaks, including SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, that SSEs follow a power law distribution with fat tails, or infinite variance. We then extend an otherwise standard SIR model with estimated power law distributions, and show that idiosyncratic uncertainties in SSEs will lead to large aggregate uncertainties in infection dynamics, even with large populations. That is, the timing and magnitude of outbreaks will be unpredictable. While such uncertainties have social costs, we also find that they on average decrease the herd immunity thresholds and the cumulative infections because per-period infection rates have decreasing marginal effects. Our findings have implications for social distancing interventions: targeting SSEs reduce not only the average rate of infection (R0) but also its uncertainty. To understand this effect, and to improve inference of the average reproduction numbers under fat tails, estimating the tail distribution of SSEs is vital.","Fukui, M.; Furukawa, C.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.11.20128058; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.11.20128058v1?rss=1,12

These two diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children under 5 years of age. Vitamin D is believed to have immunomodulatory effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems by modulating the expression of antimicrobial peptides, like cathelicidin, in response to both viral and bacterial stimuli. The aim of this review is to summarize the more recently published data with regard to potential associations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] with infectious respiratory tract diseases of childhood and the possible health benefits from vitamin D supplementation. METHODS: The literature search was conducted by using the PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, with the following keywords: vitamin D, respiratory tract infection, tuberculosis, influenza, infancy, and childhood. RESULTS: Several studies have identified links between inadequate 25(OH)D concentrations and the development of upper or lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children. Some of them also suggest that intervention with vitamin D supplements could decrease both child morbidity and mortality from such causes. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies agree in that decreased vitamin D concentrations are prevalent among most infants and children with RTIs. Also, normal to high-serum 25(OH)D appears to have some beneficial influence on the incidence and severity of some, but not all, types of these infections. However, studies with vitamin D supplementation revealed conflicting results as to whether supplementation may be of benefit, and at what doses.","Zisi, Dimitra; Challa, Anna; Makis, Alexandros",Hormones (Athens),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31768940/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42000-019-00155-z,12

In addition to recession and high unemployment, agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warn that stressors associated with a pandemic can cause increased strains, including difficulty concentrating, anxiety, and decreased mental health (CDC, 2020). Two general frameworks that explain these stressor-strain relationships over time include stress-reaction and adaptation models. Stress-reaction models suggest that stressors, such as heightened job demands due to the pandemic, accumulate over time and thus prolonged exposure to these stressors results in both immediate and long-term strain; conversely, adaptation models suggest that people adapt to stressors over time, such that strains produced by ongoing stressors tend to dissipate. After controlling for county-level COVID-19 cases, we found that (a) workers in general exhibited decreasing cognitive weariness and psychological symptoms over time, providing support for the adaptation model; (b) on-site workers experienced increasing physical fatigue over time, supporting the stress-reaction model among those workers; and (c) engaging in recovery behaviors was associated with improvements in cognitive weariness and psychological symptoms for all workers. We also found that our Time 1 outcomes were significantly different than pre-pandemic norms, such that our participants displayed lower initial levels of job-related burnout and higher initial levels of psychological symptoms than pre-pandemic norms. Furthermore, supplemental qualitative data support our quantitative findings for recovery behaviors. These findings have important implications for understanding workers’ responses to the pandemic and they can help inform organizational practice.","Michel, Jesse S.; Rotch, Michael A.; Carson, Jack E.; Bowling, Nathan A.; Shifrin, Nicole V.",Occup Health Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34007876/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41542-021-00087-4,12

We aimed to characterise registered clinical trials assessing drugs or plasma treatments for COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analysis of clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 that were registered in the USA or in countries contributing to the WHO’s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Relevant trial entries of drugs or plasma were downloaded on 26 March 2020, deduplicated, verified with reviews of major medical journals and WHO websites and independently analysed by two reviewers. MAIN OUTCOME(S): Trial intervention, sponsorship, critical design elements and specified outcomes RESULTS: Overall, 201 clinical trials were registered for testing the therapeutic benefits of 92 drugs or plasma, including 64 in monotherapy and 28 different combinations. Only eight (8.7%) products or combinations involved new molecular entities. The other test therapies had a wide range of prior medical uses, including as antivirals, antimalarials, immunosuppressants and oncology treatments. In 152 trials (75.7%), patients were randomised to treatment or comparator, including 55 trials with some form of blinding and 97 open-label studies. The 49 (24.4%) of trials without a randomised design included 29 single armed studies and 20 trials with some comparison group. Most trial designs featured multiple endpoints. Clinical endpoints were identified in 134 (66.7%) of trials and included COVID-19 symptoms, death, recovery, required intensive care and hospital discharge. Clinical scales were being used in 33 (16.4%) trials, most often measures of oxygenation and critical illness. Surrogate endpoints or biomarkers were studied in 88 (42.3%) of trials, primarily assays of viral load. Although the trials were initiated in more than 17 countries or regions, 100 (49.8%) were registered in China and 78 (37.8%) in the USA. Registered trials increased rapidly, with the number of registered trials doubling from 1 March to 26 March 2020. CONCLUSIONS: While accelerating morbidity and mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic has been paralleled by early and rapid clinical investigation, many trials lack features to optimise their scientific value. Global coordination and increased funding of high-quality research may help to maximise scientific progress in rapidly discovering safe and effective treatments.","Mehta, Hemalkumar B; Ehrhardt, Stephan; Moore, Thomas J; Segal, Jodi B; Alexander, G Caleb",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32518212/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039978,12

COVID-19 characteristics – elevated infectivity, rapid spread, and general population susceptibility – pose a great challenge to hospitals. Infectious disease, pulmonology, and intensive care units have been strengthened and expanded. All other specialties have been compelled to suspend or reduce clinical and elective surgical activities. The profound effects on spine surgery call for systematic approaches to optimizing the diagnosis and treatment of spinal diseases. Here, based on the experience of one Italian region, we draw an archetype for assessing the current and predicted level of stress in the health care system, with the aim of enabling hospitals to make better decisions during the pandemic.

This case describes a child who developed an aorto-esophageal fistula 25 days after initial battery ingestion and survived due to prompt placement of an aortic stent via minimally invasive surgery, avoiding an open procedure. CASE PRESENTATION: A 6-year-old female presented acutely with a mid-esophageal button battery impaction witnessed by her parents. Presenting symptoms included chest pain and emesis. Button battery location and size were confirmed on X-ray. She underwent removal with flexible esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and rigid esophagoscopy. She was admitted to the hospital and received conservative medical management, with serial cross-sectional imaging via chest MRIs to assess the evolution of her injury according to available national guidelines, and was discharged after 12 days of close inpatient monitoring. Despite these measures the patient represented 25 days post-ingestion with hematemesis from a new aorto-esophageal fistula, requiring emergent cardiac catheterization with successful, life-saving aortic stent placement. She remained admitted for an additional 12 days of monitoring as her diet was advanced slowly post-catheterization. Since this second hospitalization she continues to do well, with outpatient follow-up by multiple subspecialists. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the continued uncertainty regarding the risk of developing this complication, as well as gaps in the current literature and guidelines for managing these patients following ingestion and esophageal injury.

Aside from the detection of viral genome with specific RT-PCR, there is a growing need for reliable determination of the serological status. We aimed at evaluating five SARS-CoV-2 serology assays. METHODS: An in-house immunofluorescence assay (IFA), two ELISA kits (EUROIMMUN(®) ELISA SARS-CoV-2 IgG and NovaLisa(®) SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM) and two lateral flow assays (T-Tek(®) SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Antibody Test Kit and Sure Bio-tech(®) SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG Antibody Rapid Test) were compared on 40 serums from RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and 10 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative subjects as controls. RESULTS: Control subjects tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with all five systems. Estimated sensitivities varied from 35.5 to 71.0% for IgG detection and from 19.4 to 64.5% for IgM detection. For IgG, in-house IFA, EuroImmun, T-Tek and NovaLisa displayed 50–72.5% agreement with other systems except IFA vs EuroImmun and T-Tek vs NovaLisa. Intermethod agreement for IgM determination was between 30 and 72.5%. DISCUSSION: The overall intermethod agreement was moderate. This inconsistency could be explained by the diversity of assay methods, antigens used and immunoglobulin isotype tested. Estimated sensitivities were low, highlighting the limited value of antibody detection in CoVID-19. CONCLUSION: Comparison of five systems for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies showed limited sensitivity and overall concordance.

The outbreak was traced to a seafood wholesale market and human to human transmission was confirmed. The rapid spread and the death toll of the new epidemic warrants immediate intervention. The intra-host genomic variability of SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role in the development of effective antiviral agents and vaccines, but also in the design of accurate diagnostics. We analyzed NGS data derived from clinical samples of three Chinese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, in order to identify small- and large-scale intra-host variations in the viral genome. We identified tens of low- or higher-frequency single nucleotide variations (SNVs) with variable density across the viral genome, affecting 7 out of 10 protein-coding viral genes. The majority of these SNVs corresponded to missense changes. The annotation of the identified SNVs but also of all currently circulating strain variations revealed colocalization of intra-host but also strain specific SNVs with primers and probes currently used in molecular diagnostics assays. Moreover, we de-novo assembled the viral genome, in order to isolate and validate intra-host structural variations and recombination breakpoints. The bioinformatics analysis disclosed genomic rearrangements over poly-A / poly-U regions located in ORF1ab and spike (S) gene, including a potential recombination hot-spot within S gene. Our results highlight the intra-host genomic diversity and plasticity of SARS-CoV-2, pointing out genomic regions that are prone to alterations. The isolated SNVs and genomic rearrangements, reflect the intra-patient capacity of the polymorphic quasispecies, which may arise rapidly during the outbreak, allowing immunological escape of the virus, offering resistance to anti-viral drugs and affecting the sensitivity of the molecular diagnostics assays.","Karamitros, Timokratis; Papadopoulou, Gethsimani; Bousali, Maria; Mexias, Anastasios; Tsiodras, Sotiris; Mentis, Andreas",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.009480,12

Both vaccination doses, which are subject to a non-necessarily identical effectiveness, are administrated by respecting a certain mutual delay interval, and their immunity effect is registered after a certain delay since the second dose. The delays and the efficacies of the doses are parameters, which can be fixed in the model for each concrete experimentation. The disease-free equilibrium point is characterized as well as its stability properties, while it is seen that no endemic equilibrium point exists. The exposed subpopulation is supposed to be infective eventually, under a distinct transmission rate of that of the infectious subpopulation. Some simulation examples are presented by using disease parameterizations of the COVID-19 pandemic under vaccination efforts requiring two doses.","De la Sen, Manuel; Alonso-Quesada, Santiago; Ibeas, Asier; Nistal, Raul",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9040398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33919501/,12

686482,A Polypeptide of Tumor-Associated Antigen L6 with Intrinsic Adjuvant Activity Enhances Antitumor Immunity,2020-10-21,"The origin and functions of mast cells (MCs) have been debated since their description by Paul Ehrlich in 1879. MCs have long been considered 'reactive bystanders' and 'amplifiers' in inflammatory processes, allergic reactions, and host responses to infectious diseases. However, knowledge about the origin, phenotypes and functions of MCs has increased substantially over the past 50 years. MCs are now known to be derived from multipotent hematopoietic progenitors, which, through a process of differentiation and maturation, form a unique hematopoietic lineage residing in multiple organs. In particular, MCs are distinguishable from basophils and other hematopoietic cells by their unique phenotype, origin(s), and spectrum of functions, both in innate and adaptive immune responses and in other settings. The concept of a unique MC lineage is further supported by the development of a distinct group of neoplasms, collectively referred to as mastocytosis, in which MC precursors expand as clonal cells. The clinical consequences of the expansion and/or activation of MCs are best established in mastocytosis and in allergic inflammation. However, MCs have also been implicated as important participants in a number of additional pathologic conditions and physiological processes. In this article, we review concepts regarding MC development, factors controlling MC expansion and activation, and some of the fundamental roles MCs may play in both health and disease. We also discuss new concepts for suppressing MC expansion and/or activation using molecularly-targeted drugs.","Valent, Peter; Akin, Cem; Hartmann, Karin; Nilsson, Gunnar; Reiter, Andreas; Hermine, Olivier; Sotlar, Karl; Sperr, Wolfgang R.; Escribano, Luis; George, Tracy I.; Kluin-Nelemans, Hanneke C.; Ustun, Celalettin; Triggiani, Massimo; Brockow, Knut; Gotlib, Jason; Orfao, Alberto; Kovanen, Petri T.; Hadzijusufovic, Emir; Sadovnik, Irina; Horny, Hans-Peter; Arock, Michel; Schwartz, Lawrence B.; Austen, K.

Serologic assays for antibody detection aid patient diagnosis and seroepidemiologic investigations. METHODS: An indirect IgG ELISA was developed indigenously using β-propiolactone (BPL) inactivated SARS-CoV-2. This assay was used for screening 200 healthy donor sera collected prior to COVID-19 emergence (2017–2019), 185 serum/plasma samples of confirmed COVID-19 patients (n = 137) and 57 samples of viral RNA positive asymptomatic contacts (n = 51). The IgG response was studied in relation to duration and severity of illness. RESULTS: The ELISA demonstrated 97 % specificity and IgG detection in >50 %, 80 %, 93.8 % and 100 % of the patients respectively during the first, second, third and fourth week of illness. IgG detection rate was higher in patients with severe disease (SD, 90.9 %) than those with mild disease (MD, 68.8 %) during the second week of illness (P = 0.027). IgG seropositivity among asymptomatic contacts was 64.7 %. IgG ELISA absorbance values were higher in SD than MD patients during the first 2 weeks of illness (P < 0.05). No significant difference was observed between the absorbance values of asymptomatic subjects and MD patients (P = 0.94). CONCLUSION: The BPL inactivated virus-based ELISA could detect IgG antibodies early and in a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients suggesting its potential utility as a supplement to the currently used viral RNA detection tests in patient diagnosis and contact screening algorithms.","Kulkarni, Ruta; Patil, Harshad P.; Palkar, Sonali; Lalwani, Sanjay; Mishra, Akhilesh Chandra; Arankalle, Vidya",J Virol Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33126149/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2020.113996; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093420302482; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093420302482,12

Misinformation infodemics undermine not only population safety but also compliance to the suggestions and prophylactic measures recommended during pandemics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study is to review the impact of social media on general population fear in “infoveillance” studies during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol was followed, and 6 out of 20 studies were retrieved, meta-analyzed, and had their findings presented in the form of a forest plot. RESULTS: The summary random and significant event rate was 0.298 (95% CI 0.213-0.400), suggesting that social media–circulated misinformation related to COVID-19 triggered public fear and other psychological manifestations. These findings merit special attention by public health authorities.

Most countries around the globe suspended schools and provided alternative educational methods. And Saudi Arabia is not an exception. This study aims to investigate the situation of Saudi Deaf students in compulsory education during the suspension of schools. The study presents a discussion on the alternative education methods and content provided by the Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia during this crisis and is followed by individual semi-structured interviews with eighteen teachers for Deaf students. Three categories were formulated: (1) Deaf students' educational status during the suspension of schools (full exclusion); (2) teachers' responses to the exclusion of their students; and (3) reasons for the full exclusion. The findings suggest that governments and educational organisations in Saudi Arabia need to facilitate inclusion practices for Deaf students in alternative educational methods and tools, including distance education.","Madhesh, Abdullah",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842703/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06536,12

The estimation of transmission dynamics in the initial days of the outbreak of disease is crucial to control its spread in a new area. The serial interval is one of the significant epidemiological measures that determine the spread of infectious disease. It is the time interval between the onset of symptoms in the primary and secondary case. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed at the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of the currently available evidence for the serial interval of COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: Data on serial intervals were used from 11 studies by implementing inclusion and exclusion criteria after initial screening. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled estimate of the serial interval. The heterogeneity and bias in the included studies were tested by various statistical measures and tests, including I(2) statistic, Cochran's Q test, Egger's test, and Beggs's test. RESULT: The pooled estimate for the serial interval was 5.40 (5.19, 5.61) and 5.19 (4.37, 6.02) by the fixed and random effects model, respectively. The heterogeneity between the studies was found to be 89.9% by I(2) statistic. There is no potential bias introduced in the meta-analysis due to small study effects. CONCLUSION: The present review provides sufficient evidence for the estimate of serial interval of COVID-19, which can help in understanding the epidemiology and transmission of the disease. The serial interval can be useful for policy makers including contract tracing and monitoring community transmission of COVID-19.","Rai, Balram; Shukla, Anandi; Dwivedi, Laxmi Kant",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32869006/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398420301895?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213398420301895; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2020.08.007,12

We aimed to assess the uptake of virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic using comprehensive population-based data from Ontario. METHODS: This was a repeated cross-sectional study design. We used administrative data to evaluate changes in in-person and virtual visits among all residents of Ontario before (2012–2019) and during (January–August 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. We included all patients who had an ambulatory care visit in Ontario. We excluded claims for patients who were not Ontario residents or had an invalid or missing health card number. We compared monthly or quarterly virtual care use across age groups, neighbourhood income quintiles and chronic disease subgroups. We also examined physician characteristics that may have been associated with virtual care use. RESULTS: Among all residents of Ontario (population 14.6 million), virtual care increased from 1.6% of total ambulatory visits in the second quarter of 2019 to 70.6% in the second quarter of 2020. The proportion of physicians who provided 1 or more virtual visits per year increased from 7.0% in the second quarter of 2019 to 85.9% in the second quarter of 2020. The proportion of Ontarians who had a virtual visit increased from 1.3% in 2019 to 29.2% in 2020. Older patients were the highest users of virtual care. The proportion of total virtual visits that were provided to patients residing in rural areas (v. urban areas) declined significantly between 2012 and 2020, reflecting a shift in virtual care to a service increasingly used in urban centres. The rates of virtual care use increased similarly across all conditions and across all income quintiles. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that Ontario’s approach to virtual care led to broad adoption across all provider groups, patient age, types of chronic diseases and neighborhood income. These findings have policy implications, including use of virtual care billing codes, for the ongoing use of virtual care during the second wave of the pandemic and beyond.","Bhatia, R.

This article quantifies the aggregate, distributional, and welfare consequences of moving toward such an optimal level. A heterogeneous households general equilibrium model featuring both life cycle and dynastic elements is calibrated to replicate some characteristics of the Spanish economy and used to evaluate potential reforms of the tax system. The findings suggest that increasing progressivity would be optimal, even though it would involve an efficiency loss. The optimal reform of the tax schedule would reduce wealth and income inequality at the cost of negative effects on capital, labor, and output. Finally, these theoretical results are evaluated using tax microdata and describe a current scenario where the income-top households typically face suboptimal effective average tax rates.","Serrano-Puente, Darío",SERIEs (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33250942/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13209-020-00226-0,12
690069,The Emerging Role of Epigenetic Mechanisms in the Causation of Aberrant MMP Activity during Human Pathologies and the Use of Medicinal Drugs,2021-04-15,"As globalization increases the interconnectedness between nations, economies, and industries, the introduction of diseases will continue to remain a prominent threat to the livestock sector and the trade of animals and animal products, as well as the livelihoods of farmers, food security and public health. The global pig sector, with its size and dichotomy between production type and biosecurity level, is particularly vulnerable to the transmission of transboundary animal diseases such as African and classical swine fever, foot and mouth disease, or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. All of the above pose a constant threat to swine health, mainly as a result of both formal and informal international trade. Inspired in the risk assessment methodology, this paper classifies and provides an overview of the different pig disease introduction and exposure pathways, illustrated with abundant examples. Introduction pathways are classified as formal international trade (by product), informal international trade (by product), and spread through fomites. Formal trade of pigs and pork products is regulated by legislation and measures protecting animal populations from exotic diseases. Much more difficult to control is the transboundary swine disease transmission originating through informal trade, which entails illegal smuggling, but also the informal cross-border transfer of animals and products for personal use or within informal market chains. Meat products are most commonly mentioned, although fomites have also played a role in some cases, with live pigs, being more difficult to smuggle playing a role less frequently. The main exposure pathways are also described with the oral route playing a prominent role. Risk assessments can aid in the identification of pathways of pathogen introduction and exposure. However, quantitative information on informal disease introduction pathways remains very scarce and often incomplete, making it difficult to estimate the actual magnitudes of risks. Nevertheless, this knowledge is deemed essential to set up risk based awareness, prevention and surveillance programs that correspond to reality.","Beltran-Alcrudo, Daniel; Falco, John R.; Raizman, Eran; Dietze, Klaas",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30795759/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1800-5,12
690111,Emerging Viral Infections,2012-08-11,"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is a global health emergency warranting development and implementation of targeted treatment. The enzyme main protease (Mpro; also known as 3C-like protease) is emerging as an attractive drug target. This enzyme plays an indispensable role in processing the translated polyproteins of viral RNA. Inhibiting the activity of Mpro would wedge viral replication. To facilitate the discovery of targeted therapy for COVID-19, we carried out the structure-assisted repurposing of existing protease inhibiting small molecules to target SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Based on the structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, here we report the small drug molecule namely saquinavir as its potent inhibitor. Findings support the premise that this promising antiviral protease inhibiting small drug molecule can be validated and implemented for the treatment and clinical management of COVID-19 pandemic disease.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
