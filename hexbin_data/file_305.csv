1522,1522,1522,A Multi-Method Approach to Curriculum Development for In-Service Training in China’s Newly Established Health Emergency Response Offices,20.189583,2.028231,2014-06-27,"OBJECTIVE: To describe an innovative approach for developing and implementing an in-service curriculum in China for staff of the newly established health emergency response offices (HEROs), and that is generalisable to other settings. METHODS: The multi-method training needs assessment included reviews of the competency domains needed to implement the International Health Regulations (2005) as well as China’s policies and emergency regulations. The review, iterative interviews and workshops with experts in government, academia, the military, and with HERO staff were reviewed critically by an expert technical advisory panel. FINDINGS: Over 1600 participants contributed to curriculum development. Of the 18 competency domains identified as essential for HERO staff, nine were developed into priority in-service training modules to be conducted over 2.5 weeks. Experts from academia and experienced practitioners prepared and delivered each module through lectures followed by interactive problem-solving exercises and desktop simulations to help trainees apply, experiment with, and consolidate newly acquired knowledge and skills. CONCLUSION: This study adds to the emerging literature on China’s enduring efforts to strengthen its emergency response capabilities since the outbreak of SARS in 2003. The multi-method approach to curriculum development in partnership with senior policy-makers, researchers, and experienced practitioners can be applied in other settings to ensure training is responsive and customized to local needs, resources and priorities. Ongoing curriculum development should reflect international standards and be coupled with the development of appropriate performance support systems at the workplace for motivating staff to apply their newly acquired knowledge and skills effectively and creatively.","Wang, Yadong; Li, Xiangrui; Yuan, Yiwen; Patel, Mahomed S.",PLoS One,305,13

LASV is endemic to West Africa and is transmitted through contact with excretions of infected Mastomys natalensis rodents and other rodent species. Due to a high fatality rate, lack of treatment options and difficulties with prevention and control, LASV is one of the high-priority pathogens included in the WHO R&D Blueprint. The WHO LASV vaccine strategy relies on availability of effective diagnostic tests. Current diagnostics for LASV include in-house and commercial (primarily research-only) laboratory-based serological and nucleic acid amplification tests. There are two commercially available (for research use only) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and a number of multiplex panels for differential detection of LASV infection from other endemic diseases with similar symptoms have been evaluated. However, a number of diagnostic gaps remain. Lineage detection is a challenge due to the genomic diversity of LASV, as pan-lineage sensitivity for both molecular and immunological detection is necessary for surveillance and outbreak response. While pan-lineage ELISA and RDTs are commercially available (for research use only), validation and external quality assessment (EQA) is needed to confirm detection sensitivity for all known or relevant strains. Variable sensitivity of LASV PCR tests also highlights the need for improved validation and EQA. Given that LASV outbreaks typically occur in low-resource settings, more options for point-of-care testing would be valuable. These requirements should be taken into account in target product profiles for improved LASV diagnostics.","Mazzola, Laura T; Kelly-Cirino, Cassandra",BMJ Glob Health,305,5

African responses have been varied and largely ineffective. The WHO and the international community’s belated responses have yet to quell the epidemic. The crisis is characteristic of a failure to properly comply with the International Health Regulations 2005. More generally, it stems from a failure of international health justice as articulated by a range of legal institutions and instruments, and it should prompt us to question the state and direction of approaches to the governance of global public health. This paper queries what might be done to lift global public health as a policy arena to the place of prominence that it deserves. It argues that there are at least two critical reasons for the past, present and easily anticipated future failings of the global public health regime. After exploring those, it then articulates a new way forward, identifying three courses of action that might be adopted in realising better health outcomes and global health justice, namely value, institutional and legal reform.","Harmon, Shawn H.

A cross-sectional survey (2018) was combined with retrospective data (2009–2017) from 785 primary care (PC) facilities in six provinces. Measures for the output of clinical care and of public health services were aggregated into a single (weighted) index for both service profiles. The output–workforce relationship was measured by its ratio. Latent class growth analysis and logistic regression analysis were applied to classify trajectories and determine associations with facility-level, geographic, and economic characteristics. From 2009 to 2017, the proportion of PC to overall healthcare workforce decreased from 24.25% to 18.57%; the proportion of PH to PC providers at PC facilities increased from 23.6% to 29.5%, while the proportion of PH output increased from 44.3% to 65.9%. Four trajectories of the output–workforce relationship were identified for CC, and five trajectories for PH services of which 85.3% of the facilities showed initially increasing and then slightly decreasing trends. Geographic characteristics impacted different trajectories. The PC workforce falls behind hospital workforce. The expansion in workload of PH services is unbalanced with that of workforce.","Lu, Shan; Zhang, Liang; Klazinga, Niek; Kringos, Dionne",Int J Environ Res Public Health,305,5

H9N2 AIV was first reported in the Northeast of Algeria in April 2017, following an outbreak associated with high mortality, in broiler flocks. In the present study, we report full-length genome sequences of AIV H9N2, and the detailed phylogeny and molecular genetic analyses. METHODS: Ten AIV H9N2 strains, collected in broiler flocks, were amplified in 9-day-old embryonated specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken eggs. Their full-length genomes were successfully sequenced and phylogenetic and molecular characterizations were conducted. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolates were monophyletic, grouped within the G-1 lineage and were very close to Moroccan and Algerian strains identified in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The low pathogenicity of the strains was confirmed by the sequence motif (335RSSR/GLF341) at the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site. An exclusive substitution (T197A) that had not been previously reported for H9N2 viruses; but, conserved in some pandemic H1N1 viruses, was observed. When compared to the G1-like H9N2 prototype, the studied strains showed one less glycosylation site in HA, but 2–3 additional ones in the stalk of the neuraminidase (NA). The HA protein harbored the substitution 234 L, suggesting binding preference to human-like receptors. The NA protein harbored S372A and R403W substitutions, previously detected in H9N2 from Asia and the Middle East, and especially in H2N2 and H3N2 strains that caused human pandemics. Different molecular markers associated with virulence and mammalian infections have been detected in the viral internal proteins. The matrix M2 protein possessed the S31N substitution associated with drug resistance. The non-structural 1 (NS1) protein showed the “GSEV” PDZ ligand (PL) C-terminal motif and no 80–84 deletion. CONCLUSION: Characterized Algerian AIV isolates showed mutations that suggest increased zoonotic potential. Additional studies in animal models are required to investigate the pathogenicity of these H9N2 AIV strains. Monitoring their evolution in both migratory and domestic birds is crucial to prevent transmission to humans. Implementation of adequate biosecurity measures that limit the introduction and the propagation of AIV H9N2 in Algerian poultry farm is crucial.","Barberis, Abdelheq; Boudaoud, Amine; Gorrill, Angelina; Loupias, Josianne; Ghram, Abdeljelil; Lachheb, Jihene; Alloui, Nadir; Ducatez, Mariette F.",Virol J,305,12

Data on the genetic diversity of HAstV in Nigeria are limited. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of classical HAstV in children under 5 years of age with acute gastroenteritis in Ogun State, Nigeria. Fecal samples (331) as well as socio-demographic and clinical data were collected across the three senatorial districts of the state from February 2015 to April 2017. One hundred seventy-five samples were randomly selected and analyzed for the presence of HAstV using RT-PCR. PCR amplicons from positive samples were sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis was done to determine genotypes and lineages. The overall prevalence rate was 19.4% (34), with the highest occurrence observed in 2015 (41.4%). Viral coinfections were detected in 13 cases (38.2%). HAstV infection occurred throughout the year and in all age groups, mainly in the age group of 0-12 months. There was significant association between prevalence rate and collection year; however, no association was observed with gender, age, symptoms or risk factors. HAstV-5 was the predominant genotype (76.5%) circulating throughout the study period, followed by HAstV-1 (23.5%), which circulated only in the first 2 years of the study. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all HAstV-5 strains detected belonged to the 5a lineage, while HAstV-1 strains were grouped into lineage 1b. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first comprehensive report on molecular characterization of classical HAstV among children with gastroenteritis in the country, and this will serve as baseline information for implementing appropriate infection control practices.","Arowolo, K.

The organism, designated strain IF1, was identified as a member of the genus Arthrobacter on the basis of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis. Arthrobacter strain IF1 was able to mineralize 4-FP up to concentrations of 5 mM in batch culture. Stoichiometric release of fluoride ions was observed, suggesting that there is no formation of halogenated dead-end products during 4-FP metabolism. The degradative pathway of 4-FP was investigated using enzyme assays and identification of intermediates by gas chromatography (GC), GC–mass spectrometry (MS), high-performance liquid chromatography, and liquid chromatography–MS. Cell-free extracts of 4-FP-grown cells contained no activity for catechol 1,2-dioxygenase or catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, which indicates that the pathway does not proceed through a catechol intermediate. Cells grown on 4-FP oxidized 4-FP, hydroquinone, and hydroxyquinol but not 4-fluorocatechol. During 4-FP metabolism, hydroquinone accumulated as a product. Hydroquinone could be converted to hydroxyquinol, which was further transformed into maleylacetic acid and β-ketoadipic acid. These results indicate that the biodegradation of 4-FP starts with a 4-FP monooxygenase reaction that yields benzoquinone, which is reduced to hydroquinone and further metabolized via the β-ketoadipic acid pathway.","Ferreira, Maria Isabel M.; Marchesi, Julian R.; Janssen, Dick B.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,305,5

Little is known regarding its efficacy in eliminating medium-sized cytokines in sepsis. This study aimed to explore the effects of continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) using the EMiC2 filter on cytokine clearance. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study conducted in critically ill patients with sepsis and acute kidney injury requiring kidney replacement therapy. We measured concentrations of 12 cytokines [Interleukin (IL) IL-1β, IL-1α, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-γ, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, vascular endothelial growth factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, epidermal growth factor (EGF)] in plasma at baseline (T0) and pre- and post-dialyzer at 1, 6, 24, and 48 h after CVVHD initiation and in the effluent fluid at corresponding time points. Outcomes were the effluent and adsorptive clearance rates, mass balances, and changes in serial serum concentrations. RESULTS: Twelve patients were included in the final analysis. All cytokines except EGF concentrations declined over 48 h (p < 0.001). The effluent clearance rates were variable and ranged from negligible values for IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-1β, and EGF, to 19.0 ml/min for TNF-α. Negative or minimal adsorption was observed. The effluent and adsorptive clearance rates remained steady over time. The percentage of cytokine removal was low for most cytokines throughout the 48-h period. CONCLUSION: EMiC2-CVVHD achieved modest removal of most cytokines and demonstrated small to no adsorptive capacity despite a decline in plasma cytokine concentrations. This suggests that changes in plasma cytokine concentrations may not be solely influenced by extracorporeal removal.

They invade plants, which in turn may develop symptoms. Since their discovery about 50 years ago, more than thirty viroids have been reported and classified using as species demarcation less than 90 per cent sequence identity on the overall genome and evidence of biological divergence with respect to the closest related viroids. In the last few years, new viroids have been identified that infect latently their (frequently) woody hosts and have a narrow experimental hosts range, complicating and slowing down studies on their biology. As a consequence, several viroids are still waiting for classification. Moreover, the number of new viroids is expected to increase in the next years due to the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies with diagnostics purposes. Therefore, establishment of reliable species demarcation criteria mainly based on molecular features of viroids is needed. Here, viroid classification is reassessed and a scheme based on pairwise sequence identity matrices is developed. After identifying a threshold pairwise identity score (PWIS) for each viroid genus, to be used as a species demarcation criterion, we show that most of those yet unclassified viroids can be assigned to a known or to a new species, thus limiting the need for additional biological evidence to only a few more complex situations. The advantages of this PWIS-based method are that the proposed identity thresholds for species demarcations are not arbitrarily established and evidence for biological divergence is not mandatory. Importantly, the current classification is not essentially modified. A protocol for a tentative fast classification of new viroids according to the proposed approach is also provided.","Chiumenti, Michela; Navarro, Beatriz; Candresse, Thierry; Flores, Ricardo; Di Serio, Francesco",Virus Evol,305,5

In each study, we recruited participants who self-identified as members of a group implicated in an ongoing intergroup situation. In five correlational studies (Studies 1-5) we examined the relations between measured wise reasoning and intergroup positivity and attitude polarization. In two experiments, we tested the effects of a brief online wise-reasoning thought exercise on intergroup positivity and polarization (Studies 6-7), and charitable behaviors to an outgroup (Study 6). We found that wise reasoning relates to more positivity toward outgroups and less attitude polarization across different groups and conflicts.

It is well-known that many cells within the central nervous system (CNS) also contribute to ongoing neuroinflammation, which can promote neurodegeneration. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is both an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease in which there is a complex interplay between resident CNS cells to mediate myelin and axonal damage, and this communication network can vary depending on the subtype and chronicity of disease. Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cell of the CNS, and their precursors, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), are often thought of as the targets of autoimmune pathology during MS and in several animal models of MS; however, there is emerging evidence that OPCs actively contribute to inflammation that directly and indirectly contributes to neurodegeneration. Here we discuss several contributors to MS disease progression starting with lesion pathology and murine models amenable to studying particular aspects of disease. We then review how OPCs themselves can play an active role in promoting neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and how other resident CNS cells including microglia, astrocytes, and neurons can impact OPC function. Further, we outline the very complex and pleiotropic role(s) of several inflammatory cytokines and other secreted factors classically described as solely deleterious during MS and its animal models, but in fact, have many neuroprotective functions and promote a return to homeostasis, in part via modulation of OPC function. Finally, since MS affects patients from the onset of disease throughout their lifespan, we discuss the impact of aging on OPC function and CNS recovery. It is becoming clear that OPCs are not simply a bystander during MS progression and uncovering the active roles they play during different stages of disease will help uncover potential new avenues for therapeutic intervention.","Psenicka, Morgan W.; Smith, Brandon C.; Tinkey, Rachel A.; Williams, Jessica L.",Front Cell Neurosci,305,5

This leads to stress and subsequently to pecking and cannibalism. Environmental enrichment is suggested to reduce stress and feather pecking, thus leading to an increase of the overall flock health. However, the effect of increasing age on the use of enrichment elements and on the behavior repertoire as well as its correlation with health parameters has scarcely been studied. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the influence of environmental enrichment on the behavioral repertoire and on health parameters of turkeys. In 3 consecutive trials, female turkeys were housed up to 12 wk either in an unstructured (control group) or enriched environment (EE group) featuring elevated plateaus at different levels (“turkey tree”). Behavior parameters, clinical health, and immune parameters were determined at selected time points. The percentage of birds using the turkey tree increased with age up to 55 to 77% at 22 to 30 d post hatch (dph). Thereafter, the number of birds located on the turkey tree decreased to 25 to 32% at 73 to 79 dph. Feather pecking and fighting was significantly lower in the EE group compared to the control group in 2 and 3 trials, respectively (P < 0.05). The integrity of feathers and integument, scored in the head/neck, wing, and tail regions was repeatedly better in the EE birds compared to control birds at most investigated time points (P < 0.05), suggesting a reduction in stress related aggression by the use of the turkey tree. Head pecking, running and flying activity, foraging, and preening were overall comparable between the EE and the control group (P > 0.05). Humoral immunity as determined by vaccination-induced anti-Newcastle disease virus antibody titers was not affected by the turkey tree use. The flow cytometric evaluation of blood monocyte and T-lymphocyte numbers showed no repeatable difference between control and EE groups. Interestingly, compared to the control groups, EE birds displayed significantly higher numbers of circulating MHC class II(+) lymphocytes and lower numbers of thrombocytes at various time points compared to controls (P < 0.05). This study provides clear evidence that environmental enrichment with plateaus not only leads to an altered behavioral repertoire but also modifies some of the investigated immune parameters, implying that EE may have a modulatory effect on turkeys’ immunity and overall fitness. Further studies are needed to understand the correlation between behavior and health parameters in birds more closely.","Lindenwald, R.; Schuberth, H.-J.; Spindler, B.; Rautenschlein, S.",Poult Sci,305,5

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are an attractive cell source for reducing liver damage and regressing fibrosis; additional therapies accompanying MSCs can potentially enhance their therapeutic effects. Kampo medicines exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. Here, we investigated the therapeutic effect of MSCs combined with the Kampo medicine Juzentaihoto (JTT) as a combination therapy in a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced cirrhosis mouse model. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were administered JTT (orally) and/or MSCs (one time, intravenously). The levels of liver proteins were measured in the sera. Sirius Red staining and hydroxyproline quantitation of hepatic tissues and immune cells were conducted, and their associated properties were evaluated. Liver metabolomics of liver tissues was performed. RESULTS: JTT monotherapy attenuated liver damage and increased serum albumin level, but it did not effectively induce fibrolysis. JTT rapidly reduced liver damage, in a dose-dependent manner, after a single-dose CCl4 administration. Furthermore, JTT-MSC combination therapy attenuated liver damage, improved liver function, and regressed liver fibrosis. The combination increased the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. JTT had stronger effects on NK and regulatory T cell induction, whereas MSCs more strongly induced anti-inflammatory macrophages. The combination therapy further induced anti-inflammatory macrophages. JTT normalized lipid mediators, and tricarboxylic acid cycle- and urea cycle-related mediators effectively. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of JTT enhanced the therapeutic effects of MSCs; this combination could be a potential treatment option for cirrhosis.","Iwasawa, Takahiro; Nojiri, Shunsuke; Tsuchiya, Atsunori; Takeuchi, Suguru; Watanabe, Takayuki; Ogawa, Masahiro; Motegi, Satoko; Sato, Takeki; Kumagai, Masaru; Nakaya, Taiki; Ohbuchi, Katsuya; Nahata, Miwa; Fujitsuka, Naoki; Takamura, Masaaki; Terai, Shuji",Regen Ther,305,5

Aim: This study aimed to: (1) investigate the validity and reliability of the Korean Mental Health Professionals Stress Scale (K-MHPSS), (2) develop K-MHPSS cut-off points to measure clinical depression and anxiety, and (3) examine whether specific stressors vary by area of expertise. Methodology: Data were collected via an online survey over 3 months, from August to October 2020. An online survey using a survey website was administered to volunteers who accessed the link and consented to participate. Data from 558 participants (200 clinical psychologists, 157 nurses, and 201 social workers) were included in the final analysis. Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses were conducted to examine the factor structure of the K-MHPSS; concurrent validity of the scale was determined by analyzing correlation; internal consistency was determined by Cronbach's alpha coefficient. In addition, ROC curve analysis and Youden's index were used to estimate optimal cut-off points for K-MHPSS; one-way ANOVA was performed to investigate the difference among the three groups. Results: The seven-factor model of the original scale did not be replicated by Korean mental health professionals. The K-MHPSS had the best fit with the six-factor model, which consists of 34 items. Concurrent validity was confirmed, and overall reliability was found to be good. The K-MHPSS cut-off points for depression and anxiety appeared to slightly different by professional groups. Furthermore, nurses and social workers showed significantly higher total scores compared to clinical psychologists, and there are significant differences in subscale scores among professionals. Conclusion: The Korean version of the MHPSS has appropriate psychometric properties and can be used to assess the occupational stress of mental health professionals.

While some have argued that Taiwan’s success with COVID‐19 is based on its experience with SARS, I argue that we should not attribute Taiwan’s effective response solely to its SARS experience. The country’s success mainly lies in three factors: (1) reliance on the mask policy as the main disease prevention measure and the ability to quickly expand mask production capacity; (2) use of big data and technology to enhance effective implementation of disease prevention and detection measures; and (3) strong state‐society relations favoring transparency, communication, and collaboration. The first two factors can trace their roots to the country’s developmental state model. Democracy provides the institutional underpinning for a vibrant civil society and the synergy between state and civil society, strengthening Taiwan’s crisis governance legitimacy and increasing citizens’ voluntary compliance.","Yen, Wei‐Ting",,305,30

This article follows on two emergencies gripping education globally as highlighted during the 2020 United Nations Internet Governance Forum (IGF), emphasised by two IGF youth representatives. On one hand, the pandemic crisis has exacerbated digital inequalities worldwide; on the other, the ‘overdigitisation’ of education has increased the risks of dataveillance and privacy loss. These two extremes intersect in their techno-deterministic drive, which risks side-lining students’ perspectives.

In the United States, the inability of laboratories to provide adequate testing for the causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has been the subject of negative press and national debate. Even so, these challenges have prompted pathology practices and clinical labs to change their organizations and operations for the better. The natural positive evolution of the University of Oklahoma Department of Pathology and OU Health Laboratories has been greatly accelerated by the global pandemic. While developing a substantial COVID testing response, our department of pathology and laboratories have evolved a much nimbler organizational structure, established an important research partnership, built a translational research resource, created a significant reference lab capability, and completed many key hires against a national background of hiring freezes and pay cuts. Also, the high visibility of the clinical lab and pathologists during the outbreak has reinforced the value of lab medicine to patient care across our health system. In the midst of significant ongoing changes to the structure and financing of our underlying organizations, high trust among departmental, hospital, health system, and medical school leadership during the pandemic has promoted these positive changes, allowing us to emerge much stronger from this crisis.","Blakey, Gregory L.; McCloskey, Cindy B.; Guthridge, Joel M.; Williams, Christopher L.; Lu, Rufei; Hayes, Jon T.; Pinkston, Kendal G.; Talbert, Michael L.",Acad Pathol,305,7

Indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has seriously affected this situation. With the diminishing discovery of novel antibiotics, new treatment methods are urgently required to combat MDR pathogens. Polymyxins, the cationic lipopeptide antibiotics, discovered more than half a century ago, are considered to be the last-line of antibiotics available at the moment. This antibiotic shows a great bactericidal effect against Gram-negative bacteria. Polymyxins primarily target the bacterial membrane and disrupt them, causing lethality. Because of their membrane interacting mode of action, polymyxins cause nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity in humans, limiting their usability. However, recent modifications in their chemical structure have been able to reduce the toxic effects. The development of better dosing regimens has also helped in getting better clinical outcomes in the infections caused by MDR pathogens. Since the mid-1990s the use of polymyxins has increased manifold in clinical settings, resulting in the emergence of polymyxin-resistant strains. The risk posed by the polymyxin-resistant nosocomial pathogens such as the Enterobacteriaceae group, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii, etc. is very serious considering these pathogens are resistant to almost all available antibacterial drugs. In this review article, the mode of action of the polymyxins and the genetic regulatory mechanism responsible for the emergence of resistance are discussed. Specifically, this review aims to update our current understanding in the field and suggest possible solutions that can be pursued for future antibiotic development. As polymyxins primarily target the bacterial membranes, resistance to polymyxins arises primarily by the modification of the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the outer membrane (OM). The LPS modification pathways are largely regulated by the bacterial two-component signal transduction (TCS) systems. Therefore, targeting or modulating the TCS signalling mechanisms can be pursued as an alternative to treat the infections caused by polymyxin-resistant MDR pathogens. In this review article, this aspect is also highlighted.","Mohapatra, Saswat S; Dwibedy, Sambit K; Padhy, Indira",J Biosci,305,5

A COVID-19-járvány kényszerű tartós szociális távolságtartást idézett elő az emberek között, ami az egyéb mentális rendellenességek és mentálhigiénés következmények mellett egy sajátos pszichiátriai jelenségre, a hikikomori állapotra hívja fel a figyelmet. A hikikomori tartós és szélsőséges szociális visszahúzódással járó jelenség, melynek kidolgozott kritériumrendszere egyelőre még nem található meg a mentális rendellenességeket osztályozó diagnosztikus kézikönyvekben. Kialakulásának pontos mechanizmusáról még keveset tudunk, de az állapot megjelenése és az internet térnyerése között egyes szerzők szoros kapcsolatot látnak. Klasszikusan az egyén egy társadalmi szempontból megalázó vagy előnytelenül alakuló helyzet következtében vonul vissza fokozatosan egy önként vállalt izolációba. Bár a külvilág nem teljesen érdektelen számukra, azonban a retraumatizáció elkerülése érdekében leginkább online követik a világ történéseit és tartanak kapcsolatot másokkal. A COVID-19-pandémia - különösen a lezárások következményeként előtérbe kerülő online életvitelhez kötődően - jelentős mértékben hozzájárult az internet térnyeréséhez, miközben a valós társas kapcsolatok kényszerűen beszűkültek. Ez a konstelláció jelentős kockázati tényezőnek tekinthető a hikikomori szempontjából, amely hosszú távon a világjárvány egyik nem várt szövődménye lehet, különösen az adolescens és a fiatal felnőtt korosztályban. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(41): 1637-1642. Summary. The COVID-19 pandemic forced prolonged social distancing between people. This, among other mental disorders and mental health consequences, highlights a specific psychiatric phenomenon: the hikikomori condition. The hikikomori is a phenomenon of persistent and extreme social withdrawal. The condition's established diagnostic set of criteria is not yet to be found in diagnostic manuals classifying mental disorders. Little is known about the exact mechanism of its development, but some authors see a close link between its emergence and the rise of the internet. Typically, the individual gradually withdraws into a voluntary isolation as a result of a socially humiliating or unfavourable situation. Although the outside world is not completely irrelevant to them, they tend to follow online the events of the world and they also keep in touch with others mostly online in order to avoid retraumatization. The COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in relation to the rise of online lifestyles as a consequence of lockdowns, has contributed significantly to the more and more frequent use of the internet, while real social contact has been inevitably reduced. This constellation can be seen as a major risk factor for hikikomori, which in the long term could be an unanticipated complication of the pandemic, especially in adolescents and young adults.

OBJECTIVE We sought to determine the diagnostic yield of CCE2 in the detection of colorectal superficial lesions. METHODS We performed CCE2 in 60 consecutive patients between April 2011 and -December 2017. Lesions ≥6 mm in size were detected in 34 patients (25 males, average age: 60.5 years). We performed endoscopic resection and histopathological analysis of all resected lesions within 3 months after CCE2. We considered the optical colonoscopy (OC) findings as the gold standard and evaluated CCE2 sensitivity. RESULTS Sixty-seven lesions (≥6 mm) were detected via OC, with 27 colorectal superficial lesions and 40 protruded lesions. CCE2 sensitivity for ≥6-mm-sized, superficial, and protruded lesions was 84, 78, and 88%, respectively. No significant intergroup differences were observed. CCE2 false-negative colorectal superficial lesions accounted for 31% of right-sided colon lesions and 50% of sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/Ps). The CCE2 false-negative protruded lesions accounted for 17% of right-sided colon lesions. CONCLUSION CCE2 sensitivities for colorectal superficial and protruded lesions were not significantly different. However, flat-type SSA/Ps in the right colon, especially when the transit time is fast, have a risk of demonstrating CCE2 false-negative results.","Otani, Ichiro; Oka, Shiro; Tanaka, Shinji; Iio, Sumio; Tsuboi, Akiyoshi; Kunihara, Sayoko; Hiyama, Yuichi; Chayama, Kazuaki",Digestion,305,12

Various methodologies have shown great promise in their ability to handle the complexity and size of MSI data sets. Advances in this area have been particularly appealing for MSI of biological samples, which typically produce highly complicated data with often subtle relationships between features. There are many different machine learning approaches that have been applied to MSI data over the past two decades. In this review, we focus on a subset of non-linear machine learning techniques that have mostly only been applied in the past 5 years. Specifically, we review the use of the self-organizing map (SOM), SOM with relational perspective mapping (SOM-RPM), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). While not their only functionality, we have grouped these techniques based on their ability to produce what we refer to as similarity maps. Similarity maps are color representations of hyperspectral data, in which spectral similarity between pixels-that is, their distance in high-dimensional space-is represented by relative color similarity. In discussing these techniques, we describe, briefly, their associated algorithms and functionalities, and also outline applications in MSI research with a strong focus on biological sample types. The aim of this review is therefore to introduce this relatively recent paradigm for visualizing and exploring hyperspectral MSI, while also providing a comparison between each technique discussed.","Gardner, Wil; Cutts, Suzanne M; Phillips, Don R; Pigram, Paul J",Biopolymers,305,11

However, it is critical that the laparoscopic approach does not compromise the technical quality of the liver resection. The aim of this paper was to review the learning curve of LLR in a specialist HPB unit. METHODS A prospective database was searched to identify patients undergoing LLR over a 4-year period. To assess the effect of the learning curve on outcome, the series was evaluated during two eras--early versus late. RESULTS Fifty-one (27 males, median age 68 years) patients were identified with 37 having LLR. The most common indication was for colorectal liver metastases, and the most common procedure was a non-anatomical metastectomy. Changes in management decisions (n = 14) occurred more frequently during the first era (9 vs. 5; p > 0.05). More patients underwent right hepatectomy in the late group (3 vs. 1; p < 0.05). There did not appear to be any difference in duration of surgery for laparoscopic left lateral resection between the eras (200 vs. 240 min; p > 0.05) which probably reflected trainees performing more operations during the late era. Left hepatectomy was most commonly performed in the early era compared to more right hepatectomies during the late era. CONCLUSION LLR is associated with a learning curve, but once this has been overcome it can be safely utilised in the management of malignant liver lesions even for major resections, surgical training and simultaneous resections.","Robinson, Stuart M; Hui, Kei Y; Amer, Aimen; Manas, Derek M; White, Steve A",Digestive surgery,305,1

A 3-dimensional understanding of the organ is a prerequisite for a successful outcome. A combination of procedures is usually necessary to completely repair subtotal or total nasal defects. Contouring and secondary revisions may ensue to enhance the postoperative functional and aesthetic outcome of the reconstruction. This study aimed to present a review of the various methods of microvascular reconstruction for complex nasal defects based on the radial forearm flap (RFF). Methods Two independent reviewers screened the literature on PubMed according to the inclusion criteria. The keywords for the search were ""microvascular,"" ""nasal reconstruction,"" and ""free flaps in nasal reconstruction."" Articles on locoregional flap reconstruction, experimental animal studies, letters to the editors, non-English literature, and articles without full text were excluded from the study. The protocol is registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42019146447) under the umbrella of the National Institute for Health Research, and it is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Results Eighteen eligible studies were included in our articles. The infolding RFF, multiple skin paddles RFF, and prelaminated RFF were described. The results have been more than encouraging so far. Also, 3 clinical cases where the RFF provided intranasal lining and a forehead flap resurfaced the nose were presented. Conclusion The RFF is a reliable technique for nasal reconstruction in expert hands.","Gasteratos, Konstantinos; Spyropoulou, Georgia-Alexandra; Chaiyasate, Kongkrit",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

However, recombinant gp120 preparation has proven to be difficult because of extremely low expression levels. In order to facilitate gp120 expression, previous methods predominantly involved the replacement of native signal peptide with a heterologous one, resulting in very limited improvement. Currently, preparation of recombinant gp120 with native glycans relies solely on transient expression systems, which are not amendable for large scale production. In this work, we employed a different approach for gp120 expression. Besides replacing the native gp120 signal peptide with that of rat serum albumin and optimizing its codon usage, we generated a stable gp120-expressing cell line in a glutamine synthetase knockout HEK293T cell line that we established for the purpose of amplification of recombinant gene expressions. The combined usage of these techniques dramatically increased gp120 expression levels and yielded a functional product with human cell derived glycan. This method may be applicable to large scale preparation of other viral envelope proteins, such as that of the emerging SARS-CoV-2, or other glycoproteins which require the presence of authentic human glycans.","Zou, Zhongcheng; Wang, Ruipeng; Go, Eden P; Desaire, Heather; Sun, Peter D",Protein expression and purification,305,1

However, a few recent studies have demonstrated that repetitive feedback at final recall can reverse the long-term advantage of testing over restudy. The result that feedback at long-term tests can dramatically decrease the relative effectiveness of retrieval-based learning could be important for both theoretical and practical reasons. Considering that these earlier studies administered low retrieval success at retrieval practice, we investigated whether the effect of feedback on the testing effect is modulated by the level of retrieval success during practice. In three experiments the level of success at retrieval practice was manipulated by multiple pre-practice learning trials, and multiple tests with feedback were applied after a 1-week retention interval at final recall. Our results have demonstrated that a feedback-induced reversed testing effect was present only at low retrieval success during practice (Experiment 1), whereas with moderate (Experiment 2) and high retrieval success (Experiment 3) during practice a significant testing effect emerged and no reversed testing effect was found even after repeated cycles of feedback. These results point to the conclusion that the level of retrieval success was the key factor in reversing the testing effect in earlier studies. Application of high retrieval success during practice can produce long-lasting accessible memories even in learning settings applying multiple tests with feedback.","Racsmány, Mihály; Szőllősi, Ágnes; Marián, Miklós",Memory & cognition,305,7

We aim to evaluate historical trends in this space and highlight recent developments. RECENT FINDINGS Multiple landmark heart failure trials published since 2019 have underrepresented Black patients, though several discussed this lack of representation as limitations. A review of large heart failure clinical trials from 2001 to 2016 found persistent underrepresentation of Black patients without significant change over time. Trials enrolling from North America exclusively had more proportional representation, enrolling an average of 31.6% Black participants. SUMMARY There is a shrinking proportion of Black patients in pivotal heart failure trials despite a higher prevalence of disease and associated adverse outcomes. There is increasing awareness of these disparities within the heart failure community, potentially leading to improved representation in future studies.","Azam, Tariq U; Colvin, Monica M",Current opinion in cardiology,305,29

The use of web-based online-therapy has been shown to be useful to overcome caregiver's distress syndrome and further stimulate cognitive-motor recovery of SABI-patients. Our study aimed to investigate whether a systematic online Skype-therapy(OLST) may be of support in favoring global cognitive and sensory-motor recovery in SABI-patients and reducing caregiver distress. METHODS Twenty-five SABI-subjects in inpatient regimen were provided with intensive OLST with the caregiver for 12 weeks in addition to standard neurorehabilitation. Each subject and caregiver was evaluated before and after the treatment by administering an ad hoc battery. Furthermore, 18 of 27 patients were provided with EEG recording in resting state. RESULTS We found a significant reduction in caregiver's anxiety (p<0.0001) and burden(p<0.0001). Patients showed significant improvement in trunk control (p<0.0001), functional independence (p = 0.005), functional (p = 0.01) and global communication (p = 0.004), cognitive functioning (p = 0.001), and behavioral responsiveness (p = 0.0004). The training yielded a significant connectivity change within the fronto-centro-parietal areas in the delta frequency band (p<0.0001) and the centro-parieto-occipital areas in the alpha range (p = 0.004). DISCUSSION OLST may be a useful and complementary treatment to optimize global cognitive and functional recovery in SABI-subjects and reduce caregivers' concerns in the Covid-era. OLST can foster cognitive-motor recovery potentially by favoring the plasticity-dependent functional recovery. Therefore, OLST could be proposed as a tool allowing social conversations also in the hospital setting.","De Luca, Rosaria; Rifici, Carmela; Pollicino, Patrizia; Di Cara, Marcella; Miceli, Sabrina; Sergi, Giuseppina; Sorrenti, Luisa; Romano, Michela; Naro, Antonino; Billeri, Luana; Lauria, Paola; Caminiti, Angelo; Bramanti, Placido; Torrisi, Michele",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,305,16

METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, Ovid Health Star, proceedings of five conferences (1990-2016), and reference lists for randomized trials comparing SBT techniques in intubated adults or children. Primary outcomes were initial SBT success, extubation success, or reintubation. Two reviewers independently screened citations, assessed trial quality, and abstracted data. RESULTS We identified 31 trials (n = 3541 patients). Moderate-quality evidence showed that patients undergoing pressure support (PS) compared with T-piece SBTs (nine trials, n = 1901) were as likely to pass an initial SBT (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89-1.11; I 2 = 77%) but more likely to be ultimately extubated successfully (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10; 11 trials, n = 1904; I 2 = 0%). Exclusion of one trial with inconsistent results for SBT and extubation outcomes suggested that PS (vs T-piece) SBTs also improved initial SBT success (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.12; I 2 = 0%). Limited data suggest that automatic tube compensation plus continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) vs CPAP alone or PS increase SBT but not extubation success. CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing PS (vs T-piece) SBTs appear to be 6% (95% CI 2-10%) more likely to be extubated successfully and, if the results of an outlier trial are excluded, 6% (95% CI 1-12%) more likely to pass an SBT. Future trials should investigate patients for whom SBT and extubation outcomes are uncertain and compare techniques that maximize differences in support.","Burns, Karen E A; Soliman, Ibrahim; Adhikari, Neill K J; Zwein, Amer; Wong, Jessica T Y; Gomez-Builes, Carolina; Pellegrini, Jose Augusto; Chen, Lu; Rittayamai, Nuttapol; Sklar, Michael; Brochard, Laurent J; Friedrich, Jan O",Critical care,305,24

However, so far, there is no study to discuss the influence of wearing a mask on the ventilation and blood oxygenation status in patients of spontaneous breathing with supplementary oxygen through an anesthetic facemask. This is a before-after study in the same patient, and 10 healthy volunteers were recruited, by testing the arterial blood gas parameters at key time points before and after oxygen inhalation to evaluate the effects of two different supplementary oxygen methods ('disposable medical mask + anesthetic facemask' and 'anesthetic facemask only') on the oxygenation of subjects. Our data demonstrated whether wearing a disposable medical mask or not could effectively increase the oxygen supply of the subjects compared with the basic value before oxygen inhalation; however, compared with the group without mask, the arterial oxygen partial (PaO 2) reduced significantly at each time points when subjects wearing a disposable medical mask. There was no significant difference in other parameters, and our data showed that age growth and smoking had no significant effects on the difference of PaO 2 between the groups with and without masks. This study demonstrates effective oxygen supplementation through anesthetic facemask in subjects with spontaneous breathing who is wearing a disposable medical mask, whose pulse oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen saturation can reach 100% rapidly, and this provides a theoretical basis for the management of patients with disseminated respiratory diseases to wear masks in the operating room; however, the rate and amount of PaO 2 increase are both decreased as compared to those who is not wearing a disposable medical mask during supplementary oxygenation. Whether this difference will affect the clinical outcome needs further study.","Zhao, Na; Jing, Yumiao; Guan, Jufen; Li, Xiang; Li, Xiaoguang; Xing, Yunfei; Xiang, Xinghua; Hou, YongLi; Huang, Xuejiao; Zhang, Xiyue; He, Jinxin; Wang, Xuejuan; Xu, Mingjun",Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi,305,1

To date, there has not been any broad assessment of urological surgery residency changes and concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Society of Academic Urologists distributed a questionnaire to urology residency program directors on March 30, 2020 exploring residency programs changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics are presented. A qualitative analysis of free response questions was undertaken. A post hoc analysis of differences related to local COVID-19 incidence is described. RESULTS The survey was distributed to 144 residency programs with 65 responses for a 45% response rate. Reserve staffing had started in 80% of programs. Patient-contact time had decreased significantly from 4.7 to 2.1 days per week (P<0.001). Redeployment was reported by 26% of programs. Sixty percent of programs reported concern that residents will not meet case minimums due to COVID-19. Wellness activities centered on increased communication. All programs had begun to use video-conferencing and the majority planned to continue using this. Programs in states with higher incidence of COVID-19 were more likely to report resident redeployment (48% vs 11%, P=0.002) and exposure to COVID-19-positive patients (70% vs 40%, P=0.03) and were less likely to report concerns regarding exposure (78% vs 97%, P=0.02) and personal protective equipment (PPE) availability (62% vs 89%, P=0.02).

This study sought to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a combination of multicatheter plus stent or balloon for the treatment of complex aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS All complex aneurysms that underwent coiling with the combination technique were identified from prospectively maintained neurointerventional data bases. ""Complex aneurysm"" was defined as a wide-neck aneurysm with branch incorporation into or a deep lobulation of the sac. The clinical and angiographic outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS Sixty-two complex aneurysms (12 ruptured, 50 unruptured) in 62 patients (mean age, 57 years; male/female ratio, 12:50) were treated with a combination technique by using a multicatheter plus stent (n = 42, 3 ruptured) or balloon (n = 20, 9 ruptured). Treatment-related morbidity (grade 3 hemiparesis) occurred in 1 patient (1.6%). Except for 1 patient who had treatment-related morbidity, none of the other patients with unruptured aneurysms developed new neurologic symptoms at discharge. Nine of the 12 patients with ruptured aneurysms had good outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Score, 4 or 5) at the latest follow-up (mean, 32 months; range, 6-72 months), and 1 patient died from an initial SAH. Posttreatment control angiograms revealed complete occlusion in 27, neck remnant in 34, and incomplete occlusion in 1 aneurysm. At least 1 follow-up catheter or MR angiogram was available in 80.6% (n = 50) (mean, 21 months; range, 6-65 months). There were 4 minor and 3 major recurrences (14.0%). CONCLUSIONS In this case series, the combination technique by using multicatheter plus stent or balloon seemed safe and effective for the treatment of complex aneurysms.","Jeon, H J; Kim, B M; Kim, D J; Park, K Y; Kim, J W; Kim, D I",AJNR.

Recent studies have shown that the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score, a novel nutritional index, can be useful for predicting the prognosis in some malignancies. However, its usefulness in predicting the clinical outcome of immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment in patients with NSCLC has not been clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of the CONUT score in NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 32 patients with advanced NSCLC who received pembrolizumab monotherapy. A cut-off CONUT score of 2 was used to categorize patients into low and high CONUT groups. We evaluated the relation between the clinicopathological factors including CONUT score and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the prognosis. Results Twenty-two patients were classified into the low CONUT score group, while 10 were classified into the high CONUT score group. In the univariate and multivariate analyses, the number of prior treatments and the CONUT score were found to independently predict progression-free survival (PFS) (P<0.05), while the CONUT score as well as NLR was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P<0.05). In addition, in patients who received pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment, a high CONUT score was associated with a significantly worse PFS and overall survival in comparison to a low CONUT score. Conclusions The CONUT score has potential application as a predictor of the therapeutic effect and the prognosis of NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab. Our findings suggest that in addition to the programmed cell death ligand 1 expression level, the CONUT may also be a useful indicator for selecting NSCLC patients who may benefit from ICI treatment.","Ohba, Taro; Takamori, Shinkichi; Toyozawa, Ryo; Nosaki, Kaname; Umeyama, Yasuhiro; Haratake, Naoki; Miura, Naoko; Yamaguchi, Masafumi; Taguchi, Kenichi; Seto, Takashi; Shimokawa, Mototsugu; Takenoyama, Mitsuhiro",Journal of thoracic disease,305,25

However, few studies have compared survival outcomes between LRFA and PRFA in patients with HCC. AIMS This study aimed to compare the efficacy of LRFA and PRFA for HCC treatment. METHODS Patients who underwent PRFA or LRFA as an initial treatment modality between April 2005 and April 2016 were enrolled in this study. The overall and recurrence-free survival rates were examined for each patient. Additionally, propensity score matching was performed for both groups. RESULTS The baseline characteristics of patients in the PRFA and LRFA groups showed several minor differences. Multivariate analysis showed that the RFA method was not a critical determinant of recurrence-free or overall survival (p = 0.069 and p = 0.406). Among patients who underwent RFA as the initial treatment modality, there was no significant effect between either RFA procedures on survival. After propensity score matching, univariate analysis showed a significant difference in overall survival between PRFA and LRFA (p = 0.031). Multivariate analysis showed that LRFA is a strong factor that contributed to an improved overall survival in HCC patients (hazard ratio 0.108, p = 0.040). Furthermore, our data showed that LRFA was able to limit multiple intrahepatic recurrences, as well as prevent marginal recurrence. CONCLUSIONS LRFA appears to be superior to PRFA in terms of survival.

In this study, we found that PEDV infection blocked synthetic dsRNA-induced IFN-β production by interfering with the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). We identified PEDV replicase encoded papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) as an IFN antagonist that depends on catalytic activity for its function. We show that levels of ubiquitinated proteins are reduced during PEDV infection and that PEDV PLP2 has deubiquitinase (DUB) activity that recognizes and processes both K-48 and K-63 linked polyubiquitin chains. Furthermore, we found that PEDV PLP2 strongly inhibits RIG-I- and STING-activated IFN expression and that PEDV PLP2 can be co-immunoprecipitated with and deubiquitinates RIG-I and STING, the key components of the signalling pathway for IFN expression. These results show that PEDV infection suppresses production of IFN-β and provides evidence indicating that the PEDV papain-like protease 2 acts as a viral DUB to interfere with the RIG-I- and STING-mediated signalling pathway.","Xing, Yaling; Chen, Jianfei; Tu, Jian; Zhang, Bailing; Chen, Xiaojuan; Shi, Hongyan; Baker, Susan C; Feng, Li; Chen, Zhongbin",The Journal of general virology,305,26

Like many other countries, Iran is struggling with the current situation. In this article, we aim to share our perspectives on confronting obstacles mentioned above using appropriate hospital protocols during the COVID-19 crisis. We investigated and compared the number of referred patients to the emergency room, elective, and emergent orthopedic operations in our hospital, along with a number of residents and faculty participants in the morning reports and virtual classes before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 in our hospital. The number of referred patients to the emergency room was significantly reduced; the number of orthopedic operations was also decreased to almost zero in March 2020. Meanwhile, we managed to dismiss our residents and reduce the number of in-hospital morning reports and conferences. Instead, we designed virtual classes, and the number of participants in our virtual classes grew to almost two-third of the whole participant. We also managed to fortify our virtual office system to reduce the number of in-hospital visits. Since our hospital had become a leading center for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, and the number of referred trauma patients, elective, and trauma operations, along with educational activities, was reduced. There was also a significant concern about the management of elective, trauma, and post-operative patients in this era. Orthopedic faculty members needed to react to the current situation cautiously. We were able to manage the situation with consideration of our educational path, along with the management of personal protective equipment (PPE), and the use of communication technologies and specific protocols to overcome the obstacles mentioned above. Yet involved our staff and With orthopedic faculties active involvement at in-hospital activitie and establishment of hospital protocols considering technological facilities and WHO guidelines, we can improve education, management of PPE, and both orthopedic elective and trauma patients.","Kalantar, Seyedhadi; Farhoud, Amirreza; Mortazavi, Javad",The archives of bone and joint surgery,305,1

OBJECTIVES To determine: Coefficient of variation (CV) between replicates of a commercial assay (Spec cPL) and 2 in-house assays (VetScan cPL, Vcheck cPL) under routine conditions. Effects of sample condition or personnel on results. Potential directional bias between assays. ANIMALS Serum from 12 canine clinical patients. METHODS Prospective study. Serum Spec cPL, VetScan cPL, and Vcheck cPL (6 aliquots each) were measured, and CVs were calculated, effects of sample condition and personnel were assessed using a linear mixed model, and direction of bias was assessed using least square mean cPLI concentration. RESULTS Mean %CVs for Spec cPL, VetScan cPL, and Vcheck cPL were 5.5, 17.0, and 23.7%. Three of 6 VetScan cPL samples and 5/9 Vcheck cPL samples had an unacceptably high %CV (>20%). Transportation (Spec cPL) and sample condition or personnel (VetScan cPL, Vcheck cPL) did not affect repeatability. Least square mean cPL was higher for Spec cPL (807.9 μg/L) than for VetScan cPL (558.5 μg/L) or Vcheck cPL (399.8 μg/L). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE For clinical use, the commercial Spec cPL has the highest repeatability, and Vcheck cPL has significantly lower repeatability. Both in-house assays evaluated may provide discrepant categorical results (""pancreatitis"" versus ""equivocal"" versus ""not pancreatitis"") for the same sample.

To minimise this, the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust elective surgery hub and the executive team at London Bridge Hospital (LBH) created an elective operating framework at LBH, a COVID-19 minimal site, in which patients self-isolated for two weeks and proceeded with surgery only following a negative preoperative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction swab. The aim was to determine the rates of rates of postoperative COVID-19 infection. METHODS The collaboration involved three large hospital trusts, covering the geographic area of south-east London. All patients were referred to LBH for elective surgery. Patients were followed up by telephone interview at four weeks postoperatively. RESULTS Three hundred and ninety-eight patients from 13 surgical specialties were included in the analysis. The median age was 60 (IQR 29-71) years. Sixty-three per cent (252/398) were female. In total, 78.4% of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists grade of 1-2 and the average BMI was 27.2 (IQR 23.7-31.8) kg/m2. Some 83.6% (336/402) were 'major' operations. The rate of COVID-19-related death in our cohort was 0.25% (1/398). Overall, there was a 1.26% (5/398) 30-day postoperative all-cause mortality rate. Seven patients (1.76%) reported COVID-19 symptoms, but none attended the emergency department or were readmitted to hospital as a result. CONCLUSION The risk of contracting COVID-19 in our elective operating framework was very low. We demonstrate that high-volume major surgery is safe, even at the peak of the pandemic, if patients are screened appropriately preoperatively.","Chong, Smy; Hung, Rky; Gwozdz, A; Irwin, S; Eastbury, J; Cross, T; Ahmed, K; Taylor, C; Goldenberg, S D; Sanderson, J; Olsburgh, J",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,305,1

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this article is to discuss how a college of nursing at a large public university in the southeast United States has responded to the challenges of conducting research during the novel COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Seven faculty researchers at the University of South Carolina College of Nursing share their experiences in overcoming the unique challenges of conducting research due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategies to overcome the challenges posed by COVID-19 are presented within the context of the research process, career implications, communication, and maintaining morale. RESULTS Fears of COVID-19 and social distancing measures have hindered participant recruitment, enrollment, and involvement in ongoing studies. Increasing virtual technology use and enhancing safety precautions have assisted researchers to overcome barriers. Scholarly writing has increased for some faculty members whose studies have been stalled by the pandemic, yet others have seen a decline due to additional personal responsibilities. The careers of faculty members across all ranks have been uniquely affected by the pandemic. With most faculty working remotely, enhanced communication strategies at the university and college have supported the research enterprise. Morale has been adversely affected, but a variety of personal and collegial efforts have helped faculty cope and preserve a sense of normalcy during this devastating pandemic. DISCUSSION Faculty and their ability to conduct the research needed to inform clinical and public health practice have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the challenges of conducting research during this unprecedented crisis, faculty and institutions are taking novel steps to ensure the continuity of scientific progress for improving the health and well-being of patients and populations.","Abshire, Demetrius A; McDonnell, Karen K; Donevant, Sara B; Corbett, Cynthia F; Tavakoli, Abbas S; Felder, Tisha M; Pinto, Bernardine M",Nursing research,305,5

Der f 3 is believed to be one of the major allergens in mites allergic asthma. The work was to identify the immune characteristics of Der f 3 epitope-based vaccine containing T cell and B cell epitopes. METHODS T cell lines were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of Der f 3 allergic patients. Three T cell epitopes and five B cell epitopes of Der f 3, which we identified previously, were selected to design a polypeptide (named Der f3-peptides). DNA constructions encoding these Der f 3-peptides were expressed in Escherichia coli. The T cell lines were stimulated with the peptides and tested for proliferative capacity and cytokine production. RESULTS plasmid pET28a (+)-Der f 3-peptides was constructed and expressed in E. coli BL21, and the Der f3-peptides protein was purified and confirmed by Western blotting. The Der f 3-peptides were recognized by the T cell clones from allergic patients. SI value of Der f 3 group and Der f 3-peptides group were both higher than that of PBS group (P<0.05). The Der f 3 and Der f 3 peptides induced secretions of IL-4 and IL-5 were decreased compared with that of PBS group (P<0.05). The capacity of IgE-binding to Der f 3-peptides (41.25±5.67) μg/ml was decreased dramatically compared with that of Der f 3 (83.60 ± 10.92) μg/ml (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS our results demonstrate that several major T cell epitopes and B cell epitopes of Der f 3 can be valuable for designing the peptide-based immunotherapeutics for the mites allergic asthma.","Zhan, Xiaodong; Li, Chaopin; Jiang, Yuxing; Li, Na",Nutricion hospitalaria,305,17

Cardiac injuries are an independent predictor for a poor overall outcome after trauma. The aim of the present study was to analyze systemic inflammation as well as local cardiac inflammation after experimental limb-, neuro- and combined trauma in mice. Methods Male C57BL/6 mice received either a closed tibia fracture (Fx), isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) or a combination of both (Fx ​+ ​TBI). Control animals underwent sham procedure. After 6 and 24 ​h, systemic levels of inflammatory mediators were analyzed, respectively. Locally, cardiac inflammation and cardiac structural alterations were investigated in left ventricular tissue of mice 6 and 24 ​h after trauma. Results Mice showed enhanced systemic inflammation after combined trauma, which was manifested by increased levels of KC, MCP-1 and G-CSF. Locally, mice exhibited increased expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF) in heart tissue, which was probably mediated via toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Furthermore, mice demonstrated a redistribution of connexin 43 in cardiac tissue, which appeared predominantly after combined trauma. Besides inflammation and structural cardiac alterations, expression of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) mRNA was increased in the heart early after TBI and after combination of TBI and limb fracture, indicating a modification of energy metabolism. Early after combination of TBI and tibia fracture, nitrosative stress was increased, manifested by elevation of nitrotyrosine in cardiac tissue. Finally, mice showed a trend of increased systemic levels of cardiac troponin I and heart-fatty acid binding protein (HFABP) after combined trauma, which was associated with a significant decrease of troponin I and HFABP mRNA expression in cardiac tissue after TBI and combination of TBI and limb fracture. Conclusion Mice exhibited early cardiac alterations as well as alterations in cardiac glucose transporter expression, indicating a modification of energy metabolism, which might be linked to increased systemic- and local cardiac inflammation after limb-, neuro- and combined trauma. These cardiac alterations might predispose individuals for secondary cardiac damage after trauma that might compromise cardiac function after TBI and long bone fracture. Translational potential statement Injuries to the head and extremities frequently occur after severe trauma. In our study, we analyzed the effects of closed tibia fracture, isolated TBI, and the combination of both injuries with regard to the development of post-traumatic secondary cardiac injuries.","Lackner, Ina; Weber, Birte; Haffner-Luntzer, Melanie; Hristova, Simona; Gebhard, Florian; Lam, Charles; Morioka, Kazuhito; Marcucio, Ralph S; Miclau, Theodore; Kalbitz, Miriam",Journal of orthopaedic translation,305,31

Since Stevens first introduced Sub-Tenon's anaesthesia into cataract surgery it has shown itself to be a safe, simple, and efficient technique. The advantages of this type of block are comparable to those of sharp needle anaesthesia and complications are minimal. Several studies have found that the anaesthesia provided by Sub-Tenon's capsule injection is as good as or better for cataract surgery than that achieved by retrobulbar injection, but the efficacy of Sub-Tenon's block in vitreoretinal surgery is less well established. Methods. We performed 50 vitreoretinal procedures; 50 eyes received a Sub-Tenon's injection of a 5 ml mixture (50:50) of lidocaine and ropivacaine, plus 15 IU mL-1 of Hyaluronidase. Results. In 45 cases, only one injection was needed to achieve sufficient anaesthesia and akinesia; in 5 cases a second injection was performed five minutes after the first. Mean surgical time was 45.7 minutes. After surgery, each patient was asked to indicate his value on the VAS pain scale. Mean VAS degree was 2.4. In 7 cases, VAS was > 3 and the pain was successfully managed with the administration of paracetamol in the postoperative period. No light perception was detected at the end of surgery in 33 patients. All cases with 2 injections had no light perception at the end of surgery. Anaesthesia lasted throughout the surgery in all cases. The surgeon performed all surgery comfortably and with no difficulty. Conclusions. According to our experience and to a growing body of evidence, Sub-Tenon's anaesthesia appears to be a safe, simple, versatile, and effective technique and should be considered as a real alternative method of anaesthesia in vitreoretinal surgery.","Franco, Fabrizio; Vicchio, Lidia; Barbera, Giuseppe Ruben; Virgili, Gianni; Giansanti, Fabrizio",Romanian journal of ophthalmology,305,19

Studies have focused on the relationships between complex emergencies and natural disasters with outbreaks of infectious diseases. However, there is a dearth of relevant literature on the impact of a global pandemic on vaccination programs - an important topic because delays or stops in such programs are likely to result in outbreaks and epidemics of other infectious diseases. Thus, this article discusses the negative and positive impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic may exert on vaccination for vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Negative impacts include the increased risk of VPD outbreaks in low-resource countries where vaccination programs must be temporarily halted to prevent the spread of infection. Positive effects include the strong possibility that the universally-recognized need for a coronavirus vaccine may increase people's appreciation for vaccines in general, resulting in improved vaccination uptake once the pandemic passes. Concerned stakeholders, such as governments and the World Health Organization (WHO), should seize this moment to effectively build on these positive impacts by planning renewed and revitalized post-COVID vaccination programs.","Ali, Inayat",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,305,16

The first such interaction is the recognition of viral envelope proteins by surface receptors that normally fulfil other physiological roles, a hijacking mechanism perfected over the course of evolution. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has successfully adopted this strategy using its spike glycoprotein to dock on the membrane-bound metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The crystal structures of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins alone or in complex with their receptors or other ligands were recently solved at an unprecedented pace. This accomplishment is partly due to the increasing availability of data on other coronaviruses and ACE2 over the past 18 years. Likewise, other key intervening actors and mechanisms of viral infection were elucidated with the aid of biophysical approaches.

The application of mobile technologies (mHealth) to health services delivery has the potential to reduce inequalities, empower patients to control their health, and improve the cost-effectiveness of health care delivery. Aim: To assess the efficacy of mobile technology intervention on Pap test screening adherence compared to a control condition and also determine the factors affecting the uptake of Pap smear screening practices among women in Lagos. Methods: This is a multi-center randomized controlled trial that will involve women aged 25 to 65 years attending the General Outpatient clinics of the two tertiary health institutions in Lagos, Nigeria between April and December 2020. At baseline, a total of 200 National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) enrollees will be randomized to either a text message arm or usual care (control) arm. The primary outcome is the completion of a Pap smear within 6 months of enrolment in the study. The associations between any two groups of continuous variables will be tested using the independent sample t-test (normal distribution) or the Mann-Whitney U test (skewed data) and that of two groups of categorical variables with Chi-square X 2 or Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Using binary logistic regression model, we will adjust for age and other relevant sociodemographic and clinical variables and adherence to Pap test screening.

This review discusses the practical points to prevent and treat complications in microendoscopic spine surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS A literature search was conducted for the relevant articles after a topic search on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Medline. The review is based on the experience of 1,574 spinal endoscopic procedures performed by the senior author. RESULTS Advantages of endoscopic surgery include better visualization, panoramic vision, and the ability to work around corners. Limitations with endoscopic procedures include proximal blind areas, obstruction in instrument handling due to a narrow corridor, disorientation, frequent lens fogging, loss of depth perception, and difficulty in achieving hemostasis, leading to complications and longer operative time during the learning curve. CONCLUSION Surgeons need to learn endoscopic skills in addition to microsurgical ones to perform microendoscopic procedures properly. Attending live workshops, watching operative videos, visiting various departments, watching an experienced and accomplished endoscopic surgeon, proper case selection, a multidisciplinary team approach, practicing on models, hands-on cadaveric workshops, laboratory training, and simulators can improve results and shorten the learning curve.","Yadav, Yad Ram; Lucano, Angelo; Ratre, Shailendra; Parihar, Vijay Singh","Journal of neurological surgery.

METHODS A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, ISI web of science and Scopus databases was conducted, from inception to 1 March 2020. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the effect size (as Hedge's g) of vitamin C supplementation on depressive symptoms. RESULTS Finding from 10 trials with 836 participants revealed no significant improvement in mood status in overall analysis (n = 10, Hedge's g = 0.09; 95% confidence interval: -0.15 to 0.33; P = 0.465). However, subgroup analysis showed beneficial effects of vitamin C supplementation in patients who were not prescribed antidepressants (subclinical depressed) (n = 5, Hedge's g: -0.18; 95% CI: -0.35, -0.01, P = 0.041; I2 = 0.00%,). CONCLUSIONS Although no significant effect on mood status was observed in overall population, this meta-analysis tentatively suggests that vitamin C may produce mood-elevating effects in patients with subclinical depression.

METHODS The clinical data including epidemiology, clinical symptoms, laboratory and imaging data of 117 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were admitted to Wuhan Hongshan Mobile Cabin Hospital from February 6 to March 10, 2020 were collected by telephone follow-up and analyzed, so as to provide evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. RESULTS Among the 117 COVID-19 patients who met the discharge criteria, there were 49 males and 68 females with an average age of (49.00±11.88) years old, and the average length of hospital stay was (17±6) days. Among them, 91 patients had no obvious symptoms after discharge, and the proportion of asymptomatic patients was 77.78%. A small number of patients had clinical symptoms such as chest distress, palpation and asthma, etc. after discharge. After discharge, 7 patients had chest distress symptom, 5 cases had sore throat and palpitate symptom, 4 patients still had cough, asthma and chest pain existed in 3 cases for each, and headache, diarrhea, difficulty in breathing existed in 1 case for each. The 2019-nCoV nucleic acid results of 7 discharged patients were positive, with a re-positive rate of about 5.98%. The nucleic acid positive result occurred after 10-19 days in meeting the discharge standard. Most of the patients did not receive chest CT scan after discharge, but 24 cases of the patients received chest CT scan during follow-up showed normal manifestations, and the lesions of 6 patients were all almost absorbed or normal. CONCLUSIONS Some patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan Mobile Cabin Hospital who were re-positive with 2019-nCoV nucleic acid after discharge did not cause further transmission. Moreover, the patients with re-positive nucleic acid results were not significantly correlated with their length of hospital stay and the presence of clinical symptoms after discharge as well as CT findings. It is recommended to detect feces or other specimens in discharged patients, and to strengthen the regular monitoring and follow-up of discharged patients.","Zheng, Yanlei; Hu, Ronghua; Zhang, Li; Li, Shi",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,305,24

Proven risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19 are common diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular or respiratory disorders. Until today, little is known about the psychological burden of individuals suffering from these high-risk diseases regard to COVID-19. The aim of the study was to define the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on behavior and mental health in individuals at high risk for developing a severe COVID-19 course. Items assessed generalized anxiety (GAD-7), COVID-19-related fear, adherent/dysfunctional safety behavior, and the subjective risk perception of regarding symptoms, having a severe course and dying because of COVID-19. Data were compared between participants with the high risk diseases and individuals without any of those diseases. 16,983 respondents completed the study. Generalized anxiety, COVID-19-related fear, adherent/dysfunctional safety behavior and subjective risk perception were elevated in participants with high-risk diseases. The increased COVID-19-related fear as a functional concern is a conclusion on the increased risk of a severe course. The functionality of the fear is reflected in people's increased need for security and includes an increase in both adherent and dysfunctional safety behavior that underlines the need for psychological support strategies.","Kohler, Hannah; Bäuerle, Alexander; Schweda, Adam; Weismüller, Benjamin; Fink, Madeleine; Musche, Venja; Robitzsch, Anita; Pfeiffer, Corinna; Benecke, Anke-Verena; Dörrie, Nora; Führer, Dagmar; Taube, Christian; Rassaf, Tienush; Teufel, Martin; Skoda, Eva-Maria",Journal of primary care & community health,305,24

To cope with this emergency, the COVID-19 Lombardy intensive care units (ICU) network was created. The network identified the need of defining a list of clinical recommendations to standardize treatment of patients with COVID-19 admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Three core topics were identified: 1) rational use of intensive care resources; 2) ventilation strategies; 3) non-ventilatory interventions. Identification of patients who may benefit from ICU treatment is challenging. Clinicians should consider baseline performance and frailty status and they should adopt disease-specific staging tools. Continuous positive airway pressure, mainly delivered through a helmet as elective method, should be considered as initial treatment for all patients with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19. In case of persisting dyspnea and/or desaturation despite 4-6 hours of noninvasive ventilation, endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation should be considered. In the early phase, muscle relaxant use and volume-controlled ventilation is recommended. Prone position should be performed in patients with PaO2/FiO2≤100 mmHg. For patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia, we do not recommend empiric antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia. Consultation of an infectious disease specialist is suggested before start of any antiviral therapy. In conclusion, the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network identified a list of best practice statements supported by the available evidence and clinical experience or identified as panel members expert opinions for the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Foti, Giuseppe; Giannini, Alberto; Bottino, Nicola; Castelli, Gian Paolo; Cecconi, Maurizio; Grasselli, Giacomo; Guatteri, Luca; Latronico, Nicola; Langer, Thomas; Monti, Giacomo; Muttini, Stefano; Pesenti, Antonio; Radrizzani, Danilo; Ranucci, Marco; Russotto, Vincenzo; Fumagalli, Roberto",Minerva anestesiologica,305,26

The purpose of this study is to examine the incidence and mechanisms of stroke after permanent carotid artery occlusion in this population. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing TBO testing from March 2002 to December 2011 were identified. The protocol included 30 min of balloon occlusion, continuous intraprocedural neurological assessment, angiographic imaging of collateral flow during the occlusion, and perfusion imaging. Clinical records were reviewed for procedure results, procedural complications, and the incidence and causes of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) and death over 6 months. Strokes were categorized as thromboembolic or hypoperfusion based on available clinical and imaging data. RESULTS One hundred and fifty carotid occlusion tests were performed during the study period, including 84 women and 66 men. No procedural strokes were recorded. Thirty-seven patients (25%) had permanent occlusion of the tested ICA. Six of the 37 patients had ipsilateral stroke (16.2%) and three experienced TIA (8.1%). Two strokes occurred in the immediate postoperative period (thromboembolic), two strokes occurred within days of ICA occlusion (hypoperfusion), and two strokes occurred at least 30 days from the time of ICA occlusion (thromboembolic). CONCLUSIONS The rate of ischemic stroke following carotid sacrifice remains high and most strokes are thromboembolic in nature. Our testing protocol did not eliminate the risk of hypoperfusion-related stroke. Delayed venous phase by angiography may be a better indicator of hemodynamic tolerance than perfusion imaging.","Whisenant, Justin T; Kadkhodayan, Yasha; Cross, DeWitte T; Moran, Christopher J; Derdeyn, Colin P",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,305,20

This poor clinical outcome is attributed to a lack of defined targets and patient-to-patient heterogeneity in target antigens and immune responses. To address such heterogeneity, we tested the efficacy of a personalized vaccination approach for the treatment of TNBC using the 4T1 murine TNBC model. We isolated tumor membrane vesicles (TMVs) from homogenized 4T1 tumor tissue and incorporated glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored forms of the immunostimulatory B7-1 (CD80) and IL-12 molecules onto these TMVs to make a TMV vaccine. Tumor-bearing mice were then administered with the TMV vaccine either alone or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We show that TMV-based vaccine immunotherapy in combination with anti-CTLA-4 mAb treatment upregulated immunomodulatory cytokines in the plasma, significantly improved survival, and reduced pulmonary metastasis in mice compared to either therapy alone. The depletion of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, resulted in the loss of efficacy. This suggests that the vaccine acts via tumor-specific CD8+ T cell immunity. These results suggest TMV vaccine immunotherapy as a potential enhancer of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.","Pack, Christopher D; Bommireddy, Ramireddy; Munoz, Luis E; Patel, Jaina M; Bozeman, Erica N; Dey, Paulami; Radhakrishnan, Vijayaraghavan; Vartabedian, Vincent F; Venkat, Kalpana; Ramachandiran, Sampath; Reddy, Shaker J C; Selvaraj, Periasamy",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,305,20

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING All original clinical articles published in three general orthopedics journals between July 2002 and December 2003 were reviewed. Information was collected on variables plausibly related to rates of citation, including scientific and nonscientific factors. The number of citations at 5 years was ascertained and linear regression was used to identify factors associated with rates of citation. RESULTS In the multivariate analysis, factors associated with increased rates of citation at 5 years were high level of evidence (22.2 citations for level I or II vs. 10.8 citations for level III or IV; P=0.0001), large sample size (18.8 citations for sample size of 100 or more vs. 7.9 citations for sample size of 25 or fewer; P<0.0001), multiple institutions (15.2 citations for two or more centers vs. 11.1 citations for single center; P=0.023), self-reported conflict of interest disclosure involving a nonprofit organization (17.4 citations for nonprofit disclosure vs. 10.6 citations for no disclosure; P=0.027), and self-reported conflict of interest disclosure involving a for-profit company (26.1 citations for for-profit disclosure vs. 10.6 citations for no disclosure; P=0.011). CONCLUSION High level of evidence, large sample size, representation from multiple institutions, and conflict of interest disclosure are associated with higher rates of citation in orthopedics.","Okike, Kanu; Kocher, Mininder S; Torpey, Jennifer L; Nwachukwu, Benedict U; Mehlman, Charles T; Bhandari, Mohit",Journal of clinical epidemiology,305,31

For bryozoan assemblages, depth, substratum and habitat structure are among the main factors influencing their distribution. Ecological studies on bryozoan fauna from Brazil are scarce and factors affecting the distribution and/or diversity of this common group are obscure. Here we attempted to verify the influence of bathymetry on bryozoan richness on the north shore of Bahia State, north-eastern Brazil. We identified 57 bryozoan taxa, comprising 35 families and 50 genera, all belonging to the Cheilostomata. Retevirgula multipunctata Winston, Vieira & Woollacott, 2014 and Tetraplaria dichotoma (Osburn, 1914) and the genus Aimulosia Jullien, 1888 were recorded for the first time from Bahia State. Species growing as encrusting sheets were dominant at all depths. There was a significant difference in richness among samples at different depths, with highest values of richness at 40 meters (Kruskal-Wallis Test). Analysis of similarities revealed a significant difference among the bryozoan assemblages, mainly when comparing assemblages from 10 and 20 meters with deeper ones. Also, shallower assemblages composition varied much than assemblages from 30 and 40 meters. Since depth is a proxy for several environmental parameters, further studies are needed to identify other factors influencing bryozoan distribution.","Almeida, Ana C S; Souza, Facelucia B C; Vieira, Leandro M; Nogueira, Marcos M",Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias,305,12

However, the antibody-dependent stool antigen immunoassay bears many challenges. Therefore, we developed an antibody-independent biosensing platform. The core of this platform was a triple-module biosensor. The first module was Ca2+-doped superparamagnetic nanoparticles modified with an H. pylori-specific aptamer, functioning to selectively capture H. pylori cells from samples. The second module was a bifunctional co-polymer of chloroprotoporphyrin IX iron (III)-polyethylene glycol-desferrioxamine, which could bind to H. pylori with high affinity and chelate Fe3+ from the third module of Fe3+-quenched carbon dots (CDs) solution. When the formed module 1-H. pylori-module 2 complexes reacted with module 3, a subsequent magnetic separation could scavenge Fe3+, causing fluorescence recovery from quenched CDs as the transducing mechanism. This transducer could respond to tiny changes in Fe3+ concentration with distinguishable fluorescence differences, thus conferring the biosensor with high sensitivity, a wide detection range of 10-107 CFU/mL and a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 1 CFU/mL. From simulated human stool samples, H. pylori was enriched with a centrifugal microfluidic plate to eliminate any interference from matrices, and the bacteria were subjected to detection using the biosensor. The actual LOD for the biosensing platform coupling microfluidics and the biosensor was 101, and the total time taken was 65 min. This work showcases an instant, accurate, and ultra-sensitive diagnosis of H. pylori in feces.","Wang, Zhuangzhuang; Wang, Hongying; Cheng, Xiaohong; Geng, Jiayue; Wang, Lili; Dong, Quanjiang; Liu, Chenguang; Chi, Zhenming; Chi, Zhe",Biosensors & bioelectronics,305,31

However, risk of relapse post-discharge is high, and little is known about effective strategies to support smoking cessation following discharge. We aimed to identify interventions that maintain abstinence following a smokefree stay and determine their effectiveness, as well as the likely effectiveness of Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs) used in these interventions. METHOD Systematic review and meta-analyses of studies of adult smokers ≥ 18 years of age who were temporarily or fully abstinent from smoking to comply with institutional smokefree policies. Institutions included prison, inpatient mental health, substance misuse or acute hospital settings. A Mantel-Haenszel random effects meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using biochemically verified abstinence (7-day point prevalence or continuous abstinence). BCTs were defined as 'promising' in terms of likely effectiveness (if BCT was present in ≥2 long-term effective interventions) and feasibility (if BCT was also delivered in ≥25% of all interventions). RESULTS Thirty-seven studies (intervention n=9,041, control n=6,195) were included: 23 RCTs (intervention n=6,593, control n=5,801); three non-randomised trials (intervention n=845, control n=394), and 11 cohort studies (n=1,603). Meta-analysis of biochemically-verified abstinence (n=8,544) at longest follow-up (4 weeks to 18 months) found an overall effect in favour of intervention [risk ratio (RR)=1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 - 1.49, I2 =42%]. Nine BCTs (including 'pharmacological support', 'goal setting (behaviour)' and 'social support') were characterised as 'promising' in terms of likely effectiveness and feasibility. CONCLUSION A systematic review and meta-analyses indicate that behavioural and pharmacological support is effective in maintaining smoking abstinence following a stay in a smokefree institution. Several behaviour change techniques may help to maintain smoking abstinence up to 18 months post-discharge.","Shoesmith, Emily; Huddlestone, Lisa; Lorencatto, Fabiana; Shahab, Lion; Gilbody, Simon; Ratschen, Elena",Addiction,305,1

METHODS A prospective observational study was conducted. Forty-five patients with COVID-19 admitted to Henan Provincial People's Hospital from January 13 to March 13, 2020 were enrolled and divided into normal group (13 cases), severe group (20 cases), critically severe group (12 cases) according to the severity of the disease. A total of 15 healthy subjects receiving physical examinations during the same period were collected as the healthy control group. Clinical data were collected to compare the clinical characteristics, general test results, IL-6 and CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia levels of patients in different disease severity groups and healthy control group. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of each indicator for the severity of COVID-19. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors affecting the prognosis of COVID-19 patients, and Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis was performed. RESULTS The age of the critically severe group was significantly higher than that of the severe and normal groups (years old: 66.91±17.01 vs. 59.35±18.07, 40.23±12.61, both P < 0.05), and the negative conversion time of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was significantly longer than that of the severe and normal groups (days: 19.00±10.66 vs. 18.00±7.18, 9.31±3.49, both P < 0.05). With the increase of the severity of disease, white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), calcitonin (PCT), total bilirubin (TBil), troponin I (TnI), IL-6, D-dimer and other indicators were significantly increased, while lymphocyte count (LYM), platelet count (PLT), CD4+, CD8+, oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) were significantly decreased (all P < 0.01). ROC curve showed that PaO2/FiO2, IL-6 and CD4+ had certain predictive value for disease severity of COVID-19, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of them were 0.903, 0.871, 0.689, and the 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were 0.806-0.949, 0.769-0.974, 0.542-0.853; the best cut-off values were 196.00 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), 6.02 ng/L, 355 cells/μL, respectively; the sensitivity were 73.3%, 99.3%, 73.3%, and the specificity were 96.6%, 62.1%, 65.5%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age, PaO2/FiO2, high IL-6 and low CD4+ (IL-6 ≥ 6.02 ng/L and CD4+ < 355 cells/μL) were independent risk factors affecting the prognosis of COVID-19 [hazard ratio (HR) was 1.077, 0.053 and 3.490, respectively, all P < 0.05]. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that when both high IL-6 and low CD4+ (IL-6 ≥ 6.02 ng/L and CD4+ < 355 cells/μL) were present, the mean time of adverse prognosis was (20.53±5.71) days; when increased IL-6 and decreased CD4+ were inconsistent, the mean time of adverse prognosis was (53.21±3.16) days. CONCLUSIONS The levels of IL-6 and CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia are closely related to the severity of COVID-19 disease. When IL-6 ≥ 6.02 ng/L and CD4+ < 355 cells/μL occur simultaneously, the prognosis is poor.","Shi, Xiaopeng; Qin, Lijie; Yang, Lei; Bai, Weimin; Jing, Lijuan; Mei, Kuikui",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,305,29

The study investigated whole-brain and regional brain glucose metabolism in HF patients and its association with depression comorbidity. METHODS AND RESULTS Twenty-nine hospitalized patients with symptomatic systolic HF (left ventricular ejection fraction <40%), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV and mean age of 55.5 ± 12.0 years, had psychometric questionnaires before discharge and an 18 F-FDG PET/CT brain scan after discharge. Semi-automated image analysis was performed on all cases and 30 matched controls. The metabolic parameter mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean ) was calculated for the whole brain and three brain regions implicated in depression pathogenesis. A standardized SUVmean was also estimated by dividing regional brain SUVmean with whole-brain SUVmean . Cases had lower average whole-brain SUVmean (3.90 ± 1.49 vs. 5.10 ± 1.35, P = 0.001) and average regional brain SUVmean (4.57 ± 2.31 vs. 9.96 ± 3.58, P < 0.001) compared to controls. Whole-brain SUVmean had a significant correlation with patient age, NYHA class, diabetes, creatinine levels, depression, and cognitive impairment. Regional brain SUVmean was correlated with whole-brain SUVmean and depression. The standardized SUVmean , in particular, was found to be a robust index that could differentiate HF patients with 'epiphenomenal' (>0.93) or 'real' (≤0.93) depression. CONCLUSION Heart failure patients with more severe disease showed whole-brain and regional brain hypometabolism in 18 F-FDG PET/CT. Depressed HF patients (Beck Depression Inventory score >13) exhibited different metabolic patterns that could be used to differentiate between 'epiphenomenal' and 'real' depression. Namely, presence of whole-brain hypometabolism suggested 'epiphenomenal' depression, whereas absence suggested 'real' depression. Presence of significant relative regional brain hypometabolism enhanced the likelihood of 'real' depression diagnosis.","Lyra, Vassiliki; Parissis, John; Kallergi, Maria; Rizos, Emmanouil; Filippatos, Gerasimos; Kremastinos, Dimitrios; Chatziioannou, Sofia",European journal of heart failure,305,1

It is unclear how effective this is in comparison to other forms of intravesical therapy. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of intravesical EMDA for the treatment of NMIBC. SEARCH METHODS We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE), two clinical trial registries and a grey literature repository. We searched reference lists of relevant publications and abstract proceedings. We applied no language restrictions. The last search was February 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA We searched for randomised studies comparing EMDA of any intravesical agent used to reduce bladder cancer recurrence in conjunction with transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and rated quality of evidence (QoE) according to GRADE on a per outcome basis. MAIN RESULTS We included three trials with 672 participants that described five distinct comparisons. The same principal investigator conducted all three trials. All studies used mitomycin C (MMC) as the chemotherapeutic agent for EMDA. 1. Postoperative MMC-EMDA induction versus postoperative Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) induction: based on one study with 72 participants with carcinoma in situ (CIS) and concurrent pT1 urothelial carcinoma, we are uncertain (very low QoE) about the effect of MMC-EMDA on time to recurrence (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.76; corresponding to 30 more per 1000 participants, 95% CI 180 fewer to 380 more). There was no disease progression in either treatment arm at three months' follow-up. We are uncertain (very low QoE) about serious adverse events (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.11). 2. Postoperative MMC-EMDA induction versus MMC-passive diffusion (PD) induction: based on one study with 72 participants with CIS and concurrent pT1 urothelial carcinoma, postoperative MMC-EMDA may (low QoE) reduce disease recurrence (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.98; corresponding to 147 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 235 fewer to 8 fewer). There was no disease progression in either treatment arm at three months' follow-up. We are uncertain (very low QoE) about the effect of MMC-EMDA on serious adverse events (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 8.45). 3. Postoperative MMC-EMDA with sequential BCG induction and maintenance versus postoperative BCG induction and maintenance: based on one study with 212 participants with pT1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with or without CIS, postoperative MMC-EMDA with sequential BCG may result (low QoE) in a longer time to recurrence (hazard ratio (HR) 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.77; corresponding to 181 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 256 fewer to 79 fewer) and time to progression (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.75; corresponding to 63 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 82 fewer to 24 fewer). We are uncertain (very low QoE) about the effect of MMC-EMDA on serious adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.94). 4. Single-dose, preoperative MMC-EMDA versus single-dose, postoperative MMC-PD: based on one study with 236 participants with primary pTa and pT1 urothelial carcinoma, preoperative MMC-EMDA likely (moderate QoE) results in a longer time to recurrence (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.69; corresponding to 247 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 341 fewer to 130 fewer) for a median follow-up of 86 months. We are uncertain (very low QoE) about the effect of MMC-EMDA on time to progression (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.00 to 259.93; corresponding to 34 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 193 fewer to 807 more) and serious adverse events (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.05). 5. Single-dose, preoperative MMC-EMDA versus TURBT alone: based on one study with 233 participants with primary pTa and pT1 urothelial carcinoma, preoperative MMC-EMDA likely (moderate QoE) results in a longer time to recurrence (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.57; corresponding to 304 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 390 fewer to 198 fewer) for a median follow-up of 86 months. We are uncertain (very low QoE) about the effect of MMC-EMDA on time to progression (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.00 to 247.93; corresponding to 49 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 207 fewer to 793 more) or serious adverse events (HR 1.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 5.77). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS While the use of EMDA to administer intravesical MMC may result in a delay in time to recurrence in select patient populations, we are uncertain about its impact on serious adverse events in all settings. Common reasons for downgrading the QoE were study limitations and imprecision. A potential role for EMDA-based administration of MMC may lie in settings where more established agents (such as BCG) are not available. In the setting of low or very low QoE for most comparisons, our confidence in the effect estimates is limited and the true effect sizes may be substantially different from those reported here.","Jung, Jae Hung; Gudeloglu, Ahmet; Kiziloz, Halil; Kuntz, Gretchen M; Miller, Alea; Konety, Badrinath R; Dahm, Philipp",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,305,19

BACKGROUND Although commonly referenced, the concept of the ideal prosthetic has never been fully realized. With the development of newer prosthetics and approaches to the ventral hernia repair, many surgeons do not fully understand the properties of the available prosthetics or the circumstances that warrant the use of a specific mesh. METHODS A systematic review of published literature from 1951 to June of 2009 was conducted to identify articles relating to ventral hernia repairs and the use of prosthetics in herniorrhaphy. RESULTS Important differences exist between the synthetics, composites, and biologic prosthetics used for ventral hernia repair in terms of mechanics, cost, and the ideal situation in which each should be used. CONCLUSIONS The use of synthetic mesh remains an appropriate solution for most ventral hernia repairs. Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair has created a niche for both expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and composite mesh, as they are suited to intraperitoneal placement. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that the newer biologic prosthetics are reasonable options for hernia repair in contaminated fields and for large abdominal wall defects; however, more studies need to be done before advocating the use of these biologics in other settings.","Shankaran, Vidya; Weber, Daniel J; Reed, R Lawrence; Luchette, Fred A",Annals of surgery,305,26

AIM OF THE STUDY This work assessed the prevalence of self-medication with medicinal plants and the prevalence of the concomitant use of prescribed psychiatric drugs and medicinal plants for treating symptoms associated with anxiety and depression during the Covid-19 lockdown in Mexico. MATERIALS AND METHODS The suspected adverse reactions associated with drug-herb interactions were assessed. The factors associated with self-medication, the concomitant use of herb-drug combinations, and the presence of adverse reactions due their combined use is also reported. The study was descriptive and cross-sectional using an online questionnaire conducted among population with symptoms associated with anxiety and depression (n=2100) from seven states of central-western Mexico. RESULTS The prevalence of the use of herbs (61.9%) and the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations (25.3%) were associated with being diagnosed with mental illness [OR:2.195 (1.655 - 2.912)] and the use of psychiatric medications [OR:307.994 (178.609 - 531.107)], respectively. The presence of adverse reactions (n=104) by the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations was associated with being unemployed [p=0.004, OR: 3.017 (1.404-6.486)]. CONCLUSION Health professionals should be aware if their patients concomitantly use medicinal plants and psychiatric drugs. Public health campaigns should promote the possible adverse reactions that might produce the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations for mental illnesses.","Alonso-Castro, Angel Josabad; Ruiz-Padilla, Alan Joel; Ortiz-Cortes, Miriam; Carranza, Eleazar; Ramírez-Morales, Marco Antonio; Escutia-Gutiérrez, Raymundo; Ruiz-Noa, Yeniley; Zapata-Morales, Juan Ramon",Journal of ethnopharmacology,305,1

We sought to identify prevalence and characteristics associated with exchange sex among District of Columbia (DC) high school students. METHODS We used the 2017 DC Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a cross-sectional survey of students in grades 9-12 (n = 8,578). We performed multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between exchange sex and demographic, home environment, and substance use measures. RESULTS In 2017, a total of 7.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.6-8.2) of students reported ever having engaged in exchange sex. Odds of exchange sex were higher among males (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.6-4.0) and students who had sexual contact with partners of both sexes (AOR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.2-4.9), compared with students having sexual contact with partners of opposite sex only. Exchange sex was also associated with having been kicked out, run away, or abandoned during the past 30 days (AOR: 10.7; 95% CI: 7.0-16.3]); going hungry during the past 30 days (AOR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.1-4.5); and ever using synthetic marijuana (AOR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.3-5.0) or cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines, or ecstasy (AOR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.6-5.3]), compared with those who had not. CONCLUSIONS Approximately one in 14 DC high school students engaged in exchange sex. Programs providing services to youth with unstable housing, food insecurity, or who use drugs should incorporate sexual health services to address exchange sex practices.","Head, Sara K; Eaton, Danice; Lloyd, Patricia C; McLaughlin, Aimee; Davies-Cole, John",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,305,20

Although various TTSPs have been characterized in detail biochemically and functionally, the basic properties of TMPRSS13 remain unclear. Here, we investigate the activation, inhibition, post-translational modification, and localization of TMPRSS13. We show that TMPRSS13 is a glycosylated, active protease and that its own proteolytic activity mediates zymogen cleavage. Full-length, active TMPRSS13 exhibits impaired cell-surface expression in the absence of the cognate Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor (HAI)-1 or HAI-2. Concomitant presence of TMPRSS13 with either HAI-1 or -2 mediates phosphorylation of residues in the intracellular domain of the protease, and it coincides with efficient transport of the protease to the cell surface and its subsequent shedding. Cell-surface labeling experiments indicate that the dominant form of TMPRSS13 on the cell surface is phosphorylated, whereas intracellular TMPRSS13 is predominantly non-phosphorylated. These data provide novel insight into the cellular properties of TMPRSS13 and highlight phosphorylation of TMPRSS13 as a novel post-translational modification of this TTSP family member and potentially other members of this family of proteases.","Murray, Andrew S; Varela, Fausto A; Hyland, Thomas E; Schoenbeck, Andrew J; White, Jordan M; Tanabe, Lauren M; Todi, Sokol V; List, Karin",The Journal of biological chemistry,305,9

Lung injury causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) appears to be a most dreaded complication occurring in ∼30%. Older patients with cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities and ARDS have an increased mortality. Although the precise mechanisms involved in the development of lung injury have not been fully elucidated, the role of the extended renin-angiotensin system (RAS) appears to be pivotal. In this context, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an ACE homologue, has been recognized as a facilitator of viral entry into the host, albeit its involvement in other counter-regulatory effects, such as converting angiotensin (Ang) II into Ang 1-7 with its known protective actions. Thus, concern was raised that the use of RAS inhibitors by increasing ACE2 expression may enhance patient susceptibility to the COVID virus. However, current data have appeased such concerns as there has been no clinical evidence of a harmful effect of these agents as based on observational studies. However, properly designed future studies will be needed to further confirm or refute current evidence. Furthermore, other pathways may also play important roles in COVID-19 transmission and pathogenesis; spike (S) protein proteases facilitate viral transmission by cleaving S protein that promotes viral entry into the host; neprilysin (NEP), a neutral endopeptidase known to cleave natriuretic peptides, degrades Ang I into Ang 1-7; NEP can also catabolize bradykinin and thus mitigate bradykinin's role in inflammation, while, in the same context, specific bradykinin inhibitors might also negate bradykinin's harmful effects. Based on these intricate mechanisms, various preventive and therapeutic strategies may be devised, such as upregulating ACE2 and/or using recombinant ACE2, and exploiting the NEP, bradykinin and serine protease pathways, in addition to anti-inflammatory and antiviral therapies. These issues are herein reviewed, available studies are tabulated and pathogenetic mechanisms are pictorially illustrated.","Manolis, Antonis S; Manolis, Theodora A; Manolis, Antonis A; Melita, Helen",Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology,305,1

The clusters of many cases were reported with the epidemic progresses. We collected currently available information for 377 COVID-19 clusters (1 719 cases), excluded the hospital clusters and Hubei cases, during the period from January 1, 2020 to February 20, 2020. There were 297 family clusters (79%), case median 4; 39 clusters of dining (10%), case median 5; 23 clusters of shopping malls or supermarkets (6%), case median 13; 12 clusters of work units (3%), case median 6, and 6 clusters of transportation. We selected 325 cases to estimate the incubation period and found its range is 1 to 20 days, median was 7 days, and mode was 4 days.

The exact pathomechanism of TBI-induced ALI is poorly understood, limiting treatment options. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) can mitigate detrimental outcomes following transplants, cardiac arrests, and neurological injuries. In this study, we hypothesized that RIC would reduce TBI-induced ALI by regulating the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) dependent pathway, a central regulator of endothelial barrier integrity, lymphocyte and myokine trafficking. Male mice were subjected to either diffuse TBI by midline fluid percussion or control sham injury and randomly assigned among 4 groups: sham, TBI, sham RIC, or TBI RIC; RIC was performed one-hour prior to TBI. Mice were euthanized at one-hour post-injury or 7 days post-injury (DPI) and lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and blood were collected. Lung tissue was analyzed for histopathology, irisin myokine levels, and S1P receptor levels. BAL fluid and blood were analyzed for cellularity and myokine/S1P levels, respectively. One-hour post-injury, TBI damaged lung alveoli and increased neutrophil infiltration; RIC preserved alveoli. BAL from TBI mice had more neutrophils and higher neutrophil/monocyte ratios compared with sham, where TBI RIC mice showed no injury-induced change. Further, S1P receptor 3 and irisin-associated protein levels were significantly increased in the lungs of TBI mice compared with sham, which was prevented by RIC. However, there was no RIC-associated change in plasma irisin or S1P. At 7DPI, ALI in TBI mice was largely resolved, with evidence for residual lung pathology. Thus, RIC may be a viable intervention for TBI-induced ALI to preserve lung function and facilitate clinical management.","Saber, Maha; Rice, Amanda D; Christie, Immaculate; Roberts, Rebecca G; Knox, Kenneth S; Nakaji, Peter; Rowe, Rachel K; Wang, Ting; Lifshitz, Jonathan",Shock,305,7

DESIGN Using detailed financial reporting from fiscal year (FY) 2018 from Ohio's local health departments (LHDs), we characterize spending by Foundational Public Health Services (FPHS). We also constructed estimates of the gap in public health spending in the state using self-reported gaps in service provision and a microsimulation approach. Data were collected between January and June 2019 and analyzed between June and September 2019. PARTICIPANTS Eighty-four of the 113 LHDs in the state of Ohio covering a population of almost 9 million Ohioans. RESULTS In FY2018, Ohio LHDs spent an average of $37 per capita on protecting and promoting the public's health. Approximately one-third of this investment supported the Foundational Areas (communicable disease control; chronic disease and injury prevention; environmental public health; maternal, child, and family health; and access to and linkages with health care). Another third supported the Foundational Capabilities, that is, the crosscutting skills and capacities needed to support all LHD activities. The remaining third supported programs and activities that are responsive to local needs and vary from community to community. To fully meet identified LHD needs in the state pre-COVID-19, Ohio would require an additional annual investment of $20 per capita on top of the current $37 spent per capita, or approximately $240 million for the state.

We sought to determine whether this difference impacts morphologic contrast-enhanced MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two hundred twenty-nine adult patients with suspected or known brain tumors underwent two 1.5T MR imaging examinations with gadoteridol or gadobutrol administered in randomized order at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg of body weight. Imaging sequences and T1 postinjection timing were identical for both examinations. Three blinded readers evaluated images qualitatively and quantitatively for lesion detection and for accuracy in characterization of histologically confirmed brain tumors. Data were analyzed by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, the McNemar test, and a mixed model. RESULTS Two hundred nine patients successfully completed both examinations. No reader noted a significant qualitative or quantitative difference in lesion enhancement, extent, delineation, or internal morphology (P values = .69-1.00). One hundred thirty-nine patients had at least 1 histologically confirmed brain lesion. Two readers found no difference in the detection of patients with lesions (133/139 versus 135/139, P = .317; 137/139 versus 136/139, P = .564), while 1 reader found minimal differences in favor of gadoteridol (136/139 versus 132/139, P = .046). Similar findings were noted for the number of lesions detected and characterization of tumors (malignant/benign). Three-reader agreement for characterization was similar for gadobutrol (66.4% [κ = 0.43]) versus gadoteridol (70.3% [κ = 0.45]). There were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events (P = .199). CONCLUSIONS Gadoteridol and gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg of body weight provide similar information for visualization and diagnosis of brain lesions. The 2-fold higher gadolinium concentration of gadobutrol provides no benefit for routine morphologic imaging.","Maravilla, K R; Smith, M P; Vymazal, J; Goyal, M; Herman, M; Baima, J J; Babbel, R; Vaneckova, M; Žižka, J; Colosimo, C; Urbańczyk-Zawadzka, M; Mechl, M; Bag, A K; Bastianello, S; Bueltmann, E; Hirai, T; Frattini, T; Kirchin, M A; Pirovano, G",AJNR.

Some predictors of treatment outcome are suggested, but the evidence is limited. The primary aim of this study was to explore if selected pre-treatment characteristics of the participants in a recently conducted randomized controlled trial were associated with treatment outcome. Methods In this study secondary analysis of data collected in a randomized trial were conducted. The participants were women with chronic pelvic pain randomized to two different physical therapy treatments. Analyses in this study were performed for the whole group as a cohort. The primary outcome measure was change in pain intensity from baseline to 12 months, measured with the numeric rating scale (0-10). The women were asked to rate their mean pelvic pain intensity during the last 7 days. Based on previous research and on available variables from the randomized controlled trial four potential predictive factors were derived from the baseline data and assessed one by one in a linear regression model, adjusted for age and treatment group. The variables with strongest association (p < 0.10) with the primary outcome were further included in a multivariable linear regression model with backward selection, adjusted for age and treatment group. Results Fifty women (mean age 38.1, SD = 12.2) were included in the analysis. For these women the mean change in pain intensity was -1.2 points (95% CI -1.8 to -0.7) from baseline to 12 months. The multivariable regression model showed that pelvic pain duration of 6 years or more was associated with less decrease in pain intensity with a regression coefficient of 1.3 (95% CI 0.3-2.4). Baseline pain intensity was associated with higher pain reduction after PT treatment with a regression coefficient per SD increase in baseline pain of -0.6 (95% CI -1.1 to -0.1). None of the women with main pain site other places than in the pelvis reported any pain reduction after physical therapy treatment, but due to the small numbers the predictor was not included in the regression analysis. Conclusions We identified that pelvic pain duration of 6 years or more was associated with less pain reduction, and that higher baseline pain intensity was associated with higher pain reduction after physical therapy treatment in this sample of women with chronic pelvic pain. For the variable main pain site other places than the pelvis the results are unsure due to small numbers. Implications Based on our finding of long pain duration as a negative predictor for pain reduction, we emphasize that early intervention is important. Many of the participants in our RCT reported pelvic surgeries or other treatments prior to referral for PT, and we suggest that referral to a non-invasive intervention such as PT should be considered at an earlier stage. In order to tailor interventions to the individual women's needs, thorough baseline assessments, preferably in a multidisciplinary setting, should be performed.","Nygaard, Ane S; Haugstad, Gro K; Wilsgaard, Tom; Øian, Pål; Stedenfeldt, Mona",Scandinavian journal of pain,305,26

However, little is known about factors associated with tuberculosis treatment outcomes in this underserved group. In this study, we aimed to investigate social and health factors associated with unfavourable treatment outcomes in young people with tuberculosis in Brazil. METHODS A national retrospective cohort study was done using data from Sistema de Informação de Agravos de Notificação (SINAN), the national tuberculosis registry in Brazil. People aged 10-24 years (young people) with tuberculosis registered in SINAN between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2018, were included. Unfavourable outcomes were defined as loss to follow-up, treatment failure, and death. Favourable outcome was defined as treatment success. Multiple logistic regression models estimated the association between social and health factors and tuberculosis treatment outcomes. FINDINGS 67 360 young people with tuberculosis were notified to SINAN, and we included 41 870 young people in our study. 7024 (17%) of the 41 870 included individuals had unfavourable treatment outcomes. Young people who received government cash transfers were less likely to have an unfavourable outcome (adjusted odds ratio 0·83, 95% CI 0·70-0·99). Homelessness (3·03, 2·07-4·42), HIV (2·89, 2·45-3·40), and illicit drug use (2·22, 1·93-2·55) were the main factors associated with unfavourable treatment outcome. INTERPRETATION In this national cohort of young people with tuberculosis in Brazil, tuberculosis treatment success rates were lower than WHO End TB Strategy targets, with almost a fifth of participants experiencing unfavourable treatment outcomes. Homelessness, HIV, and illicit drug use were the main factors associated with unfavourable outcome. In Brazil, strategies are required to support this underserved group to ensure favourable tuberculosis treatment outcomes.

With the aim of reducing the axillary scar, we shared our 5 cases to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of quadrantectomy with laparoscopic axillary clearance through a single incision. PATIENTS AND METHODS From May 2010 to January 2013, single-incision quadrantectomy and laparoscopic axillary clearance were performed on 5 patients with early breast cancer by using conventional laparoscopic instruments. Surgical techniques and short-term outcomes were summarized and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS All the operations were successful with operative duration of 85-120 minutes, intraoperative blood loss of 20-50 mL, and hospital stay of 4-6 days. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were recorded. The incision wound healed uneventfully, with no scar in the axillary fossa. CONCLUSIONS The combination of single-incision quadrantectomy and laparoscopic axillary clearance in the treatment of early breast cancer appears to be a technically safe and feasible alternative to the standard laparoscopic procedure and can be performed using conventional laparoscopic instruments.","Wu, Shuo-Dong; Fan, Ying; Kong, Jing; Yu, Hong",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

In this updated 2020 Mental Health and Addictions Scorecard, we report on a number of indicators between 2009 and 2017. In general, we found that the performance of the mental health and addictions health system did not improve substantially over time. Among the many findings, over the past decade, suicide rates have not declined and rates of emergency department visits for deliberate self-harm have continued to rise. The highest rates of deliberate self-harm and the greatest rise over time in overall mental health and addictions-related outpatient visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations were experienced by individuals aged 14-24 years. There continues to be a growing use of mental health services in outpatient settings, with the majority of care provided by primary care physicians. We also observed a slight decrease over time in the proportion of individuals who had no physician-delivered mental health care prior to presenting to the emergency department, which suggests an improvement in access over time.","Chiu, Maria; Guttmann, Astrid; Kurdyak, Paul",Healthcare quarterly,305,16

In this context, an environmentally friendly and cost-effective method has been developed for the biomimetic synthesis of Ag nanospheres (Ag NSs) using aqueous extract of Piper nigrum for the detection of chlorite (ClO2-) and mercury (Hg2+) ions.The strong antioxidant properties of the biomolecules present in the Piper nigrum extract reduce silver ions (Ag+) to Ag0.After optimization of the formulation parameters,it was observed that1 mL of piper nigrum extract was sufficient to reduce and stabilize 100 mL of 1.5 mM of Ag+ in 2.5 h at 30 oC. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Ag NSs revealed their crystalline nature and the characteristic Bragg's diffraction peaks confirmed their face cubic crystal (FCC) lattice. The characteristic reddish-brown color and absorption surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band at 435 nm confirmed the successful fabrication of Ag NSs. Kinetic analysis revealed a three-phase growth patterninvolving nucleation, growthand stabilization. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) micrograms, showed spherical NSs with narrow polydispersity with particle size ranging from 10 to 30 nm. The synthesized NSs were exposed to various metal ions and anions. The absorption intensity of Ag NSs quenched in the presence ofmercury ions (Hg2+) among the cations and Chlorite ions (ClO2-) among the anions. The limit of detection (LOD) of 7.47 μM and 1.11 μMwas evaluated from the calibration curve for Hg2+ and ClO2-, respectively. Based on these promising results, it is suggested that the method reported is a low-cost and one step biogenic protocol for the synthesis of Ag NSs and their employment for the detection of Hg2+ and ClO2-ions.","Vashisht, Devika; Sangar, Sugandha; Kaur, Manpreet; Sharma, Ekta; Vashisht, Aseem; Ibhadon, A O; Sharma, Shweta; Mehta, S K; Singh, Kulvinder",Environmental research,305,1

The identified pathogen was an enveloped RNA betacoronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), because the continual spread of this deadly and highly infectious virus is a health emergency for all world nations. SARS-CoV-2 is associated with severe atypical pneumonia coronavirus disease-19. Typical symptoms of this disease include fever, malaise, cough, shortness of breath, and in severe cases, death. As the virus continues to invade host cells deep into alveoli, infection severity mostly depends on the undeterred immune response that is triggered by elevated levels of inflammation-inducing cytokines, called a cytokine storm. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the viral life cycle and immunological responses associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Maciorowski, Dawid; Mohama, Sara; Alsawi, Mohammed A; Ilc, David J; Gupta, Yash; El Idrissi, Samir; Lodolce, James P; Kempaiah, Prakasha",Critical reviews in immunology,305,17

Components of the complement system, known to produce a local inflammatory reaction, are associated with the plaques and tangles in AD brain, and thus a role for complement-mediated inflammation in the acceleration or progression of disease has been proposed. A complement activation product, C5a, is known to recruit and activate microglia and astrocytes in vitro by activation of a G protein-coupled cell-surface C5aR. Here, oral delivery of a cyclic hexapeptide C5a receptor antagonist (PMX205) for 2-3 mo resulted in substantial reduction of pathological markers such as fibrillar amyloid deposits (49-62%) and activated glia (42-68%) in two mouse models of AD. The reduction in pathology was correlated with improvements in a passive avoidance behavioral task in Tg2576 mice. In 3xTg mice, PMX205 also significantly reduced hyperphosphorylated tau (69%). These data provide the first evidence that inhibition of a proinflammatory receptor-mediated function of the complement cascade (i.e., C5aR) can interfere with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD rodent models, suggesting a novel therapeutic target for reducing pathology and improving cognitive function in human AD patients.","Fonseca, Maria I; Ager, Rahasson R; Chu, Shu-Hui; Yazan, Ozkan; Sanderson, Sam D; LaFerla, Frank M; Taylor, Stephen M; Woodruff, Trent M; Tenner, Andrea J",Journal of immunology,305,1

At most, if at all, a slightly increased risk can be derived from the previous case reports. In general, the risk of acute facial palsy is described in association with many vaccinations. The risk, if any, does not appear to be a specific risk of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. On the other hand, cases of acute facial palsy as symptom of a COVID-19 disease have also been described, so that the theoretical question arises as to the extent to which the vaccination may prevent rather than promote the occurrence of facial palsy.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective multicenter case series. METHODS A prospective multicenter study was conducted on patients undergoing thyroidectomies with intraoperative nerve monitoring. Electromyography waveforms of EBSLN stimulation before (S1) and after superior pole dissection (S2) were evaluated using endotracheal tube (ETT) and cricothyroid intramuscular (CTM) electrodes. Voice outcomes were assessed using Voice-Related Quality of Life Surveys and Voice Handicap Index. RESULTS A total of 131 at-risk EBSLNs were evaluated in 80 patients. Two nerves showed loss of CTM twitch coupled with an absent S2 signal response. Complete EBSLN loss of signal was more likely with: 1) Cernea EBSLN anatomic classification Type 2B; 2) with a longer distance from the sternothyroid muscle insertion site; and 3) with larger lobar volumes (P < .05). Patients who experienced a more than 50% decrement in CTM amplitudes of S2 (n = 7) by CTM electrodes had a statistically significant decline in their voice outcomes compared to those who did not (n = 69) (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Patients experienced worse voice outcomes when at least one EBSLN response amplitude decreased by more than 50% after dissection when measured by CTM needle electrodes. CTM needle electrodes have an ability to measure finer amplitude changes compared to ETT electrodes, may represent a safe method to deduce subtle EBSLN injuries, and may serve to optimize voice outcomes during thyroidectomy. CTM needle electrodes are safe and tolerated well.

The hypothesis was that extending feeding from 21 to 42 d and reducing the DCAD from -70 to -180 mEq/kg of dry matter (DM) would not be detrimental to performance. Holstein cows at 230 d of gestation were blocked by parity prepartum (48 entering their second lactation and 66 entering their third or greater lactation) and 305-d milk yield, and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments arranged as a 2 × 2 factorial. The 2 levels of DCAD, -70 or -180 mEq/kg of DM, and 2 feeding durations, the last 21 d (short) or the last 42 d (long) prepartum resulted in 4 treatments, short -70 (n = 29), short -180 (n = 29), long -70 (n = 28) and long -180 (n = 28). Cows in the short treatments were fed a diet with DCAD of +110 mEq/kg of DM from -42 to -22 d relative to calving. After calving, cows were fed the same diet and production and disease incidence were evaluated for 42 d in milk, whereas reproduction and survival was evaluated for 305 d in milk. Blood was sampled pre- and postpartum for quantification of metabolites and minerals. Reducing the DCAD linearly decreased prepartum DM intake between -42 and -22 d relative to calving (+110 mEq/kg of DM = 11.5 vs. -70 mEq/kg of DM = 10.7 vs. -180 mEq/kg of DM = 10.2 ± 0.4), and a more acidogenic diet in the last 21 d of the dry period reduced intake by 1.1 kg/d (-70 mEq/kg of DM = 10.8 vs. -180 mEq/kg of DM = 9.7 ± 0.5 kg/d). Cows fed the -180 mEq/kg of DM diet had increased concentrations of ionized Ca in blood on the day of calving (-70 mEq/kg of DM = 1.063 vs. -180 mEq/kg of DM = 1.128 ± 0.020 mM). Extending the duration of feeding the diets with negative DCAD from 21 to 42 d reduced gestation length by 2 d (short = 277.2 vs. long = 275.3 d), milk yield by 2.5 kg/d (short = 40.4 vs. long = 37.9 ± 1.0 kg/d) and tended to increase days open because of reduced pregnancy per artificial insemination (short = 35.0 vs. long = 22.6%). Results suggest that increasing the duration of feeding diets with negative DCAD from 21 to 42 d prepartum might influence milk yield and reproduction of cows in the subsequent lactation, although yields of 3.5% fat- and energy-corrected milk did not differ with treatments. Reducing the DCAD from -70 to -180 mEq/kg of DM induced a more severe metabolic acidosis, increased ionized Ca concentrations prepartum and on the day of calving, and decreased colostrum yield in the first milking, but had no effects on performance in the subsequent lactation. Collectively, these data suggest that extending the feeding of an acidogenic diet beyond 21 d is unnecessary and might be detrimental to dairy cows, and a reduction in the DCAD from -70 to -180 mEq/kg of DM is not needed.","Lopera, C; Zimpel, R; Vieira-Neto, A; Lopes, F R; Ortiz, W; Poindexter, M; Faria, B N; Gambarini, M L; Block, E; Nelson, C D; Santos, J E P",Journal of dairy science,305,16

The meaning of ""fever"" varies depending on the cutoff temperature used, the type of thermometer, the time of the day, the site of measurements, and the person's gender and race. The absence of a universally accepted definition for fever has been especially problematic during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This investigation determined the extent to which fever is defined in COVID-19 publications, with special attention to those associated with pregnancy. Results Of 53 publications identified in which ""fever"" is reported as a manifestation of COVID-19 illness, none described the method used to measure patient's temperatures. Only 10 (19%) publications specified the minimum temperature used to define a fever with values that varied from a 37.3 °C (99.1 °F) to 38.1 °C (100.6 °F). Conclusions There is a disturbing lack of precision in defining fever in COVID-19 publications. Given the many factors influencing temperature measurements in humans, there can never be a single, universally accepted temperature cut-off defining a fever. This clinical reality should not prevent precision in reporting fever. To achieve the precision and improve scientific and clinical communication, when fever is reported in clinical investigations, at a minimum the cut-off temperature used in determining the presence of fever, the anatomical site at which temperatures are taken, and the instrument used to measure temperatures should each be described. In the absence of such information, what is meant by the term ""fever"" is uncertain.","Grünebaum, Amos; Chervenak, Frank A; McCullough, Laurence B; Dudenhausen, Joachim W; Bornstein, Eran; Mackowiak, Philip A",Journal of perinatal medicine,305,26

STUDY DESIGN Eligible patients between the ages of 9 and 14 years with FAPD (n = 139) received enhanced usual care (EUC) during their medical visit to a gastroenterologist. Those that failed to respond to EUC were randomized to receive either a tailored CBT (ADAPT) plus TAU, or TAU only. ADAPT dose (4 sessions of pain management or 6 sessions of pain and anxiety management) was based on presence of clinically significant anxiety. Outcomes included feasibility, based on recruitment and retention rates. Response to ADAPT+TAU versus TAU on pain-related outcomes and anxiety measures was also investigated using a structural equation modeling (SEM) equivalent of a MANCOVA. Anxiety levels and ADAPT dose as moderators of treatment effects were also explored. RESULTS Based on recruitment and retention rates, stepped care was feasible. EUC was effective for only 8% of youth. Participants randomized to ADAPT+TAU showed significantly greater improvements in pain-related disability, but not pain levels, and greater improvements in anxiety symptoms compared with those randomized to TAU only. Anxiety and ADAPT treatment dose did not moderate the effect of treatment on disability nor pain.

Six-month-olds were familiarized with 2 versions of the same sequence, 1 corresponding to a well-formed prosodic unit and the other to a prosodically ill-formed sequence (although a successive word series). Next, infants heard 2 test passages. One included the well-formed unit, and the other included the ill-formed sequence. In Experiment 1, infants listened longer to the passage containing the well-formed unit, suggesting that such units, even when they are embedded, are better recognized. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that this better recognition does not depend on an acoustic match between the familiarized sequences and their later embeddings. This suggests that the advantage of the well-formed unit is at least partially due to infants' use of prosody to parse continuous speech.","Nazzi, Thierry; Kemler Nelson, Deborah G; Jusczyk, Peter W; Jusczyk, Ann Marie",Infancy : the official journal of the International Society on Infant Studies,305,1

Treg cell development rests on the key activities of the master-switch transcription factor, Foxp3, which establishes the essential core program that defines Treg cell lineage identity in the thymus and peripheral tissues. Moreover, Foxp3+ Treg cells integrate a variety of inflammatory signals from the tissue microenvironment to engage specialized pathways in order to adapt their suppressive functions in situ. CD4 + Treg cell subsets possess mechanisms to control both gene transcription and mRNA translation. Ultimately, the resulting proteome orchestrates distinct cellular processes that poise Treg cell subsets to respond to inflammatory signals in a timely and context-dependent manner in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues for a coordinated modulation of immunity. Thus, understanding how Treg cells control their cellular adaptation in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues may reveal therapeutic targets for the treatment of autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory diseases.","Piccirillo, Ciriaco A",Current opinion in immunology,305,9

In particular, people aware of a disease in their proximity can take measures to reduce their susceptibility. Even if no centralized information is provided about the presence of a disease, such awareness can arise through first-hand observation and word of mouth. To understand the effects this can have on the spread of a disease, we formulate and analyze a mathematical model for the spread of awareness in a host population, and then link this to an epidemiological model by having more informed hosts reduce their susceptibility. We find that, in a well-mixed population, this can result in a lower size of the outbreak, but does not affect the epidemic threshold. If, however, the behavioral response is treated as a local effect arising in the proximity of an outbreak, it can completely stop a disease from spreading, although only if the infection rate is below a threshold. We show that the impact of locally spreading awareness is amplified if the social network of potential infection events and the network over which individuals communicate overlap, especially so if the networks have a high level of clustering. These findings suggest that care needs to be taken both in the interpretation of disease parameters, as well as in the prediction of the fate of future outbreaks.","Funk, Sebastian; Gilad, Erez; Watkins, Chris; Jansen, Vincent A A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,305,20

Since 2108, we began to take microlectures to students teaching. Microlectures are online presentations, and the microlecture teaching method has many advantages, such as a short teaching time, situational resource composition, diverse communication, strong pertinence and can attend microlectures from home. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the advantages of the microlecture teaching method on students in standardized residency training. METHODS Students from our department were randomly divided into the traditional teaching group (control group) and the microlecture teaching group (observation group). The teaching duration for both groups was 3 months. All students were assessed on basic knowledge of the neurology before enrollment. After the teaching session, the students were assessed on teaching effect, theoretical operation, and clinical practice satisfaction. The students also evaluated the teachers, and the teachers evaluated the students. RESULTS A total of 84 students participated in the study and were divided equally into the observation group (42 students) and the control group (42 students). The results showed that the rate of reaching the standard of teaching effect, achievement of theory and operation, satisfaction with clinical practice, the student's grades by teachers, and student satisfaction with teachers were significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The microlecture teaching method can effectively improve the clinical teaching effect for neurology students and should be adopted in clinical teaching, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kong, Zhaohong; Li, Tao; Zhang, Zhaohui; Jiang, Jian; Mei, Junhua",Annals of palliative medicine,305,16

Currently, most wastewaters from metal recycling villages in Vietnam are directly discharged, posing great threats to the environment and human health. In this study, a small-scale combined coagulation-membrane filtration treatment of wastewater collected from a metal recycling village in Vietnam was experimentally investigated. The experimental results manifested the technical viability of the combined coagulation-membrane filtration process for the treatment of the heavily polluted metal recycling wastewater for beneficial reuse. In this combined treatment process, coagulation using ferric chloride (FeCl2) served as a pre-treatment prior to the microfiltration (MF)/reverse osmosis (RO) process. Under the optimised conditions, coagulation at the dosage of 0.2 g FeCl2 per 1,000 ml wastewater removed more than 90% of heavy metals (i.e. most notably including aluminium and chromium) from the wastewater, reducing the aluminium and chromium concentrations in the wastewater from 548.0 to 52.3 mg/L to 32.6 and 1.7 mg/L, respectively. The MF treatment of the wastewater following the coagulation further removed suspended solids and organic matters, rendering the wastewater safe for the subsequent RO filtration with respect to membrane fouling. Given the efficient pre-treatment of coagulation and MF, the RO process at the controlled water recovery of 50% was able to effectively treat the wastewater to potable water.","Tran, Lan Thu; Do, Anh Tien; Pham, Tuan Hung; Nguyen, Kim Thanh; Duong, Hung Cong",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,305,1

The current study aimed to understand the biomechanics of the local flap designs along with the effect of wound closures on the respective genders. Two Asian head templates from opposite genders were obtained to use as base models. A third-order Yeoh hyperelastic model was adapted to characterize as skin material properties. A single layer composed of combined epidermis and dermis was considered and the models were thickened according to respective anatomical positions. Each model gender was excised with a fixed defect size which was consequently covered by three different local flap designs namely advancement, rotation, and rhomboid flaps. Post-operative simulation presented various scenarios of skin flap closures. Rotation and rhomboid flaps demonstrated maximal tension at the apex of the flap for both genders as well as advancement flap in the female face model. However, advancement flap closure in the male face model presented otherwise. Yet, the deformation patterns and the peak tension of the discussed flaps were consistent with conventional local flap surgery. Moreover, male face models generated higher stresses compared to the female face models with a 70.34% mean difference.

Over the past decade, there have been a number of interventions conducted in public parks, often aimed at improving an aspect of mental or physical health. A common type of park-based interventions is aimed at increasing physical activity among adults and children. METHODS We will conduct a systematic review of peer-reviewed articles on the effects of park-based interventions on physical and mental health outcomes of adults and youth (children and adolescents). An electronic search will be conducted in four electronic databases: Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. Manual hand-searching of reference lists from studies identified as relevant by experts and of systematic reviews resulting from the search strategy will be conducted to further identify articles of interest. Inclusion criteria are peer-reviewed, quantitative studies, studies detailing an intervention conducted in a park setting, which was at the person-level or place-level, and studies published in English or Spanish. A three-stage approach will be used to screen title and abstracts and full-text articles against the inclusion and exclusion criteria and, lastly, extract data from eligible studies. Study quality will be assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias and the Community Guide's Guide to Community Preventive Services tools. Extracted data will be summarized narratively and meta-analysis will be conducted, if appropriate. DISCUSSION We aim to find relevant studies proving evidence for park-based intervention studies and their effects on health-related outcomes for youth and adults.

Using a glia-tropic coronavirus infection, which is initiated in the brain but rapidly spreads to and predominantly persists in the spinal cord, this study characterizes longitudinal changes in B cell subsets at both infected anatomical sites. The phase of T cell-dependent, antibody-independent control of infectious virus was associated with a similar recruitment of naive/early-activated IgD(+) IgM(+) B cells into both the brain and spinal cord. This population was progressively replaced by CD138(-) IgD(-) IgM(+) B cells, isotype-switched CD138(-) IgD(-) IgM(-) memory B cells (B(mem)), and CD138(+) antibody-secreting cells (ASC). A more rapid transition to B(mem) and ASC in spinal cord than in brain was associated with higher levels of persisting viral RNA and transcripts encoding factors promoting B cell migration, differentiation, and survival. The results demonstrate that naive/early-activated B cells are recruited early during coronavirus CNS infection but are subsequently replaced by more differentiated B cells. Furthermore, viral persistence, even at low levels, is a driving force for accumulation of isotype-switched B(mem) and ASC. IMPORTANCE Acute and chronic human CNS infections are associated with an accumulation of heterogeneous B cell subsets; however, their influence on viral load and disease is unclear. Using a glia-tropic coronavirus model, we demonstrate that the accumulation of B cells ranging from early-activated to isotype-switched differentiation stages is both temporally and spatially orchestrated. Acutely infected brains and spinal cords indiscriminately recruit a homogeneous population of early-activated B cells, which is progressively replaced by diverse, more differentiated subsets. The latter process is accelerated by elevated proinflammatory responses associated with viral persistence. The results imply that early-recruited B cells do not have antiviral function but may contribute to the inflammatory environment or act as antigen-presenting cells. Moreover, CNS viral persistence is a driving force promoting differentiated B cells with protective potential.","Phares, Timothy W; DiSano, Krista D; Stohlman, Stephen A; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Journal of virology,305,1

Educational interventions can be a reduction strategy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Quasi-experimental study, before-after design. Participants were chronic patients admitted into hospitalization services. Medication reconciliation was conducted at admission. The intervention consisted of a training to each prescribing physician with study contents and printed educational material. To study the association between intervention and change of frequency of unintentional discrepancies was made a logistic regression model, adjusting for selected variables. RESULTS A sample of 54 patients was studied in each stage. In the first stage it was observed that 42.6% of patients had at least one unintentional discrepancy. After intervention the proportion of patients with at least one unintentional discrepancy decreased to 24.1% (p = 0.041). In both stages, omission was the main category of unintentional discrepancy. The significant reduction after the intervention is maintained by controlling for variables such as emergency admission and pre-admission service. CONCLUSIONS Incidence of unintentional discrepancies in admission is high in chronic hospitalized patients and can be reduced through an educative strategy.","González, Claudio; González, Gabriela; Plaza-Plaza, José Cristian; Godoy, María Inés; Cárcamo, Marcela; Rojas, Cecilia",Anales de pediatria,305,17

The right monocular and binocular logMAR VA and distance stereoacuity using the FD2 were measured at 6 m with no filter (baseline) and with each filter strength. The order of testing the filters was randomized. Results were analyzed using one factor repeated measures ANOVAs, t-tests using Bonferroni correction and Pearson's product moment correlation. All filters degraded right monocular distance VA from baseline, but less significantly between the 0.4 and 0.6 filters than the other filters (p < .05 and p < .001, respectively). Degradation was in concordance with the labeled filter density, excluding filter strength 0.4. For all filter strengths, binocular VA was significantly but not clinically reduced from baseline (p < .05). Filters statistically and clinically significantly degraded distance stereoacuity from baseline (p < .001). A significant negative correlation existed between the mean degraded right monocular VA and stereoacuity (r = -0.998, p < .02). Trusetal BF significantly reduced monocular VA and stereoacuity but binocular VA remained within normal levels. The impact on VA and stereoacuity in a normal population can be of clinical relevance when applied to the use of BF for management of amblyopia and intractable diplopia.

According to an experiment, exposure to H1N1 flu news in an alarm frame evokes greater fear and increases perceived severity and vulnerability, though it does not help develop prevention and treatment efficacy. A survey of the general public also shows that attention and exposure to televised news coverage of the H1N1 flu are associated with greater levels of worry and perceptions of the severity of and vulnerability to this health problem, but they are not related to issue knowledge, detection, or prevention efficacy.

A standardized, validated method of assessing acute postoperative pain would improve the quality of clinical studies, and facilitate systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A step on the way towards this standard is to investigate the methods most commonly used in recent literature. METHODS PubMed and CINAHL databases were searched, including studies of arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery with a primary pain-related outcome during the first postoperative week, published in English from 2012 to 2017. RESULTS A total of 47 studies were included, all measuring pain intensity using a pain rating scale. Most frequently used was the visual analogue scale using the anchors ""no pain"" and ""worst pain imaginable"", with recordings at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. A total of 34 studies recorded analgesic consumption, usually as average cumulated consumption in mg. Time to first analgesic request or first pain were recorded in 11 studies, and 4 different starting points were used. DISCUSSION This review describes the currently most common methods of assessing acute postoperative pain in clinical trials of arthroscopic shoulder surgery involving rotator cuff repair, and the large variety of methods applied. Based on this study and international guidelines, several recommendations on how to measure and report postoperative pain outcomes in future trials are proposed.","Rasmussen, Jacob Korsbæk; Nikolajsen, Lone; Bjørnholdt, Karen Toftdahl",SICOT-J,305,28

Addressing parental vaccine hesitancy is essential to maintaining high vaccine coverage levels and preventing disease outbreaks; however, it is unknown if administering a vaccine hesitancy screening tool negatively impacts parental vaccine beliefs. We conducted a stratified randomized controlled trial in pediatric primary care practices. English-speaking parents ≥18 years of age seeking routine care for infants <3 months of age were eligible. Participants were randomized to receive 1 of 2 surveys - the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines (PACV) survey or a placebo survey. Six months after initial enrollment, all participants were asked to complete the PACV, regardless of initial randomization group. Our primary outcome was the proportion of hesitant to non-hesitant parents at 6-months between randomization groups. We examined associations between vaccine hesitancy and participant characteristics. We also evaluated the change in the proportion of vaccine-hesitant parents in the PACV group between baseline and 6-month follow up. We enrolled 1705 parents at baseline. At 6-month follow up, 819 parents completed the PACV (50.2% from PACV group vs. 54.1% from placebo group). The proportion of hesitant parents at 6 months did not differ between PACV and placebo groups (6.6% vs. 6.1%; p = .78) and the odds of hesitancy among PACV group participants was not higher than those in the placebo group (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.63-1.93; p = .743). Race was the only characteristic significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy at 6-month follow up (p = .003). Overall, administration of the PACV did not trigger vaccine hesitancy in this study population.","Cunningham, Rachel M; Guffey, Danielle; Minard, Charles G; Opel, Douglas J; Boom, Julie A",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,305,1

Methods: Thirteen women (mean ± SD: Age 20 ± 1 years, height 165 ± 5 cm, mass, 67 ± 9 kg) and ten men (mean ± SD: Age 21 ± 3 years, height 177 ± 6 cm, mass 78 ± 11 kg) sat inside a customized environmental chamber while the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) was adjusted to simulate altitudes of 12,000; 10,000; 8,000; 6,000; and 900 ft. The novel commercial device (Garmin fēnix®) and a medical-grade pulse oximeter (Nonin® 7500) were used to measure SpO2 and HR in triplicate at each simulated altitude. Bland-Altman analyses were used to assess differences between methods. Results: Bland-Altman analysis indicated 3.3% bias for SpO2 measurements taken on the Garmin fēnix® at 12,000 ft of simulated altitude (limits of agreement: -1.9-8.6%). Mean differences in SpO2 measurements were smaller at the remaining simulated altitudes, where bias measurements ranged from 0.7% to 0.8%. The Garmin fēnix® also underestimated heart rate, but those discrepancies were minimal (bias measurements at all simulated altitude exposures were < 1.0 bpm). Conclusions: With the exception of readings taken at 12,000 ft of simulated altitude, the Garmin fēnix® exhibits minimal overestimation of SpO2 and minimal underestimation of HR during simulated altitude exposure. These data suggest the Garmin fēnix® watch may be a viable method to monitor SpO2 and HR under most ambient environmental conditions.","Lauterbach, Claire J; Romano, Phebe A; Greisler, Luke A; Brindle, Richard A; Ford, Kevin R; Kuennen, Matthew R",Research quarterly for exercise and sport,305,17

A closed online survey among full-time doctors or nurses employed by the five collaborative hospitals who had access to smartphones was conducted. Facilitated by the hospital administrators, prospective participants received an invitation sent by the research team via the existing WeChat/QQ groups to complete an online questionnaire. A total of 2,281 participants completed the survey. This study was a sub-analysis of 1332 participants who had at least one child under the age of 18 years. Among the participants, 44.5% reported that they would likely or very likely to have their children under the age of 18 years take up COVID-19 vaccination in the next six months. After adjusting for significant background characteristics, perceived higher vaccine efficacy, longer protection duration, perceived high/very high chance for China to prevent another wave of COVID-19 outbreak with vaccines in place and willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination for themselves were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. At interpersonal level, higher frequency of information exposure through social media and direct interpersonal communication were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination, while knowing some people who experienced serious side effects following COVID-19 vaccination were associated with lower parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Despite their important roles in vaccination promotion, Chinese doctors and nurses showed low parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Effective health promotion is needed when COVID-19 vaccination become available.","Wang, Zixin; She, Rui; Chen, Xi; Li, Liping; Li, Lijuan; Huang, Zepeng; Lau, Joseph T F",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,305,19

BACKGROUND Despite restoration of epicardial blood flow during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), one-third of patients do not obtain myocardial perfusion due to impairment in the microvascular circulation. METHODS We examined the effect of symptom onset-to-balloon time (SBT) and door-to-balloon time (DBT) on myocardial reperfusion during primary PCI in STEMI, utilizing resolution of ST-segment elevation (STR) and the myocardial blush grade (MBG). The primary analysis was the relationships between SBT ≤2, >2 to 4, and >4 h and DBT ≤1, >1 to 1.5, >1.5 to 2, and >2 h with MBG and STR. Clinical risk was assessed using a modified version of the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction risk score for STEMI. RESULTS In 2,056 patients, absent microvascular perfusion (MBG 0/1) and STR (STR <30%) after primary PCI was significantly more common in patients with longer SBT, in patients with both low and high clinical risk profiles. By multivariable analysis, SBT (p < 0.0001), anterior infarction (p < 0.0001), reference vessel diameter (p = 0.005), lesion minimum lumen diameter (p < 0.0001), hyperlipidemia (p = 0.03), and current smoking (p = 0.001) were independent predictors of MBG 0/1, whereas SBT (p = 0.007), anterior infarction (p < 0.0001), and history of renal insufficiency (p = 0.0002) were independent predictors of absent STR. DBT (p < 0.0001) was an independent predictor of MBG 0/1. MBG 0/1 and STR<30% identified patients with increased 3-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS The present study suggests that delay in mechanical reperfusion therapy during STEMI is associated with greater injury to the microcirculation.","Prasad, Abhiram; Gersh, Bernard J; Mehran, Roxana; Brodie, Bruce R; Brener, Sorin J; Dizon, José M; Lansky, Alexandra J; Witzenbichler, Bernhard; Kornowski, Ran; Guagliumi, Giulio; Dudek, Dariusz; Stone, Gregg W",JACC.

The primary aim of this study is to determine to what extent a radiological response to (90)Y-DOTATOC/(90)Y-DOTATATE PRRT is associated with an improved OS. The association of biochemical and clinical response to OS were assessed as secondary outcome measures. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted on 57 patients: radiological response was classified using RECIST criteria, biochemical response was classified using WHO criteria and clinical response was assessed subjectively. Responses were recorded as positive response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD), and survival analysed. RESULTS Radiological response was achieved in 71.5% (24.5% PR, 47% SD) and was associated with a greater OS (51 and 56 months, respectively), compared with PD (18 months). A biochemical or clinical response post PRRT were not associated with a statistically significant improvement in OS. However, when combined with radiological response a survival benefit was observed according to the number of outcomes (radiological, biochemical, clinical), in which a response was observed. Mild haematological toxicity was common, renal toxicity was rare. CONCLUSION In patients with progressive metastatic NETs receiving (90)Y-DOTATOC/(90)Y-DOTATATE PRRT, a radiological response with either a PR or a SD post therapy confers a significant OS benefit.","Vinjamuri, S; Gilbert, T M; Banks, M; McKane, G; Maltby, P; Poston, G; Weissman, H; Palmer, D H; Vora, J; Pritchard, D M; Cuthbertson, D J",British journal of cancer,305,1

We retrospectively evaluated magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) follow-up data to assess the long-term patency of recanalized vessels after mechanical thrombectomy. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed medical records of consecutive patients who had undergone mechanical thrombectomy for intravenous tissue plasminogen activator-failed/ineligible acute intracranial major vessel occlusion between October 2010 and April 2013 at our institution. MRA follow-up was performed at baseline and at 24 ± 6 hours and 3 months after mechanical thrombectomy. RESULTS Forty-nine patients underwent mechanical thrombectomy for acute intracranial major vessel occlusion. Mean age was 69.7 ± 11.5 years, and baseline median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score was 15 (range, 8-24). Occlusion was found in the internal carotid artery in 18 patients (36.7%), middle cerebral artery in 26 patients (53%), and vertebral-basilar arteries in 5 patients (10.2%). Successful recanalization, as defined by a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction flow grade of 2b or 3, was achieved in 40 patients (81.6%). MRA follow-up at 24 hours after the treatment revealed that reocclusion of recanalized vessels was observed in 3 of 38 patients (7.9%). Long-term MRA follow-up showed that 2 of 27 patients (8.3%) developed diffuse severe stenosis of treated vessels. Both the patients had undergone treatment for middle cerebral artery occlusion with the Merci retriever and had been administered only anticoagulants, but not any antiplatelets. CONCLUSIONS Reocclusion or late stenosis of successfully recanalized vessels was observed in 16.2% of patients. Long-term MRA follow-up of recanalized vessels will be useful, in particular, for the patient with middle cerebral artery occlusion who undergoes mechanical thrombectomy.","Enomoto, Yukiko; Yoshimura, Shinichi; Egashira, Yusuke; Takagi, Toshinori; Tsujimoto, Masanori; Iwama, Toru",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,305,5

We therefore investigated the effects of stress index guided PEEP titration on pulmonary mechanics and hemodynamics in the prone position in a piglet acute lung injury model. METHODS Ten piglets with severe lavage-induced lung injury were mechanically ventilated in a decremental PEEP trial after full lung recruitment in the prone position. Stress-index PEEP was the level at which the airway pressure stress index was 1, and open-lung PEEP was the level at which it was required to keep the lung open according to computed tomography (CT) scans. Respiratory mechanics, blood gases, hemodynamics, and whole-lung CT were recorded at the two PEEP levels. RESULTS Respiratory system elastance and lung elastance were improved in the prone position but the ratio of chest wall elastance and respiratory system elastance was higher in the prone position. There was no significant difference between open-lung and stress-index guided PEEPs in the prone position (P = 0.46). There was no significant difference between collapsed lung volume (P = 0.07) and hyperinflation lung volume (P = 0.76) in the two groups. Similarly, there was no significant difference between open-lung and stress-index guided PEEPs in terms of oxygenation index (P = 0.95) and PaCO2 (P = 0.42).

METHODS This study was a retrospective national cohort study of veterans diagnosed with opioid use disorder (OUD) receiving buprenorphine treatment from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in fiscal years 2012-2019. The study examined trends in use of tele-buprenorphine and compared demographic and clinical characteristics in patients who received tele-buprenorphine versus those who received in-person treatment only. RESULTS Utilization of tele-buprenorphine increased from 2.29% of buprenorphine patients in FY2012 (n = 187) to 7.96% (n = 1352) in FY2019 in VHA veterans nationally. Compared to patients receiving only in-person care, tele-buprenorphine patients were less likely to be male (AOR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.73-0.98) or Black (AOR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.45-0.65). Tele-buprenorphine patients were more likely to be treated in community-based outpatient clinics rather than large medical centers (AOR = 2.91, 95% CI: 2.67-3.17) and to live in rural areas (AOR = 2.12, 95% CI:1.92-2.35).

CONCLUSIONS Use of telemedicine to deliver buprenorphine treatment in VHA increased 3.5-fold between 2012 and 2019, though overall use remained low prior to COVID-19. Tele-buprenorphine is a promising modality especially when treatment access is limited.

An RTA exposed group of 210 dogs was evaluated within 24 hours of the trauma. Their data were compared with data from a matched group of dogs with other diagnoses. UCCR was positively correlated with the trauma severity and was higher in the exposed group than in the nonexposed group (median 101.500 vs. 21.02; p < 0.0001). tT4 values were statistically similar between the two groups, but were correlated with a trauma score, while TSH (median = 0.050 vs. 0.080 ng/mL; p < 0.0001) and fT4 (median = 15.850 vs. 17.950 pmol/L; p = 0.0037) were significantly lower for the exposed group.

A similar pattern had been observed for tT4. TSH levels were not predictive of survival. This study provides insights into the endocrine characteristics of dogs suffering from acute trauma. UCCR was higher while fT4 and TSH were both lower in RTA-injured dogs than in dogs affected by other conditions. Furthermore low fT4 and tT4, and a high UCCR could be useful prognostic factors in dogs affected by RTA trauma.","Caldin, Marco; Rocchi, Paola; Zoia, Andrea; Botto, Angelica; Bertolini, Giovanna; Zappa, Giovanni; Furlanello, Tommaso",Research in veterinary science,305,31

All the existing allocation protocols that states developed are based on the assumption that clinicians will be faced with the task of selecting which patients will be offered a ventilator from among a population of patients who are each in need of one. The protocols then assign patients a priority category, and the protocols specify ""tie-breaking"" criteria to be used when necessary. The problem with this approach for ventilator allocation is that it has no relationship whatsoever to what happens in the real world.","Truog, Robert D",The Hastings Center report,305,11

We bypassed the screening step by using high-throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis to mine antibody variable region (V)-gene repertoires from bone marrow plasma cells (BMPC) of immunized mice. BMPCs, which cannot be immortalized, produce the vast majority of circulating antibodies. We found that the V-gene repertoire of BMPCs becomes highly polarized after immunization, with the most abundant sequences represented at frequencies between approximately 1% and >10% of the total repertoire. We paired the most abundant variable heavy (V(H)) and variable light (V(L)) genes based on their relative frequencies, reconstructed them using automated gene synthesis, and expressed recombinant antibodies in bacteria or mammalian cells. Antibodies generated in this manner from six mice, each immunized with one of three antigens were overwhelmingly antigen specific (21/27 or 78%).

The underlying molecular mechanism of such distinct nutrient partitioning remains poorly-investigated. Here, an optimized rapid Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) approach was used to individually collect pericarp, aleurone, embryo and endosperm from 10 Days After Fertilization (DAF) old grains. Subsequent RNA-Seq analysis in these tissues have identified 7760 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Analysis of promoter sequences of tissue specific genes identified many known and novel cis-elements important for grain filling and seed development. Using identified DEGs, comprehensive spatial gene expression pathways were built for spatial accumulation of starch, proteins, lipids and iron. The extensive transcriptomic analysis has provided many novel insights about nutrient partitioning mechanisms, for instance, it reveals a gradient in Seed Storage Protein accumulation across the analysed four tissue-types. It further reveals that partitioning of various minerals, such as iron, is most likely regulated through transcriptional control of their transporters. In addition, the extensive analysis of this study is presented as an interactive online tool (https://biogeek.shinyapps.io/DEGs/) that provides a much-needed resource for future functional genomics studies aimed to improve grain quality and seed development.","Ram, Hasthi; Singh, Anmol; Katoch, Megha; Kaur, Ravneet; Sardar, Shaswati; Palia, Shubham; Satyam, Rohit; Sonah, Humira; Deshmukh, Rupesh; Pandey, Ajay; Gupta, Ishaan; Sharma, Tilak Raj",Journal of experimental botany,305,7

CLINICAL FINDINGS Physical examination revealed a markedly distended abdomen with subjectively reduced borborygmi in all abdominal quadrants. A large, gas-distended viscus was present at the pelvic brim preventing complete palpation of the abdomen per rectum. Ultrasonographic evaluation could not be safely performed in the initial evaluation because of severe signs of abdominal pain. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Ventral midline celiotomy was performed, and right dorsal displacement of the ascending colon was corrected. Progressive signs of abdominal pain after surgery prompted repeat ventral midline celiotomy, and small intestinal incarceration in a large, radial mesojejunal rent was detected. The incarceration was reduced, but the defect was not fully accessible for repair via the celiotomy. Repair of the mesenteric defect was not attempted, and conservative management was planned after surgery; however, signs of colic returned. A standard laparoscopic approach was attempted from both flanks in the standing patient, but the small intestine could not be adequately mobilized for full evaluation of the rent. Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) allowed identification and reduction of jejunal incarceration and repair of the mesenteric rent. Although minor ventral midline incisional complications were encountered, the horse recovered fully. CLINICAL RELEVANCE HALS techniques should be considered for repair of mesenteric rents in horses. In the horse of this report, HALS facilitated identification, evaluation, and repair of a large radial mesenteric rent that was not accessible from a ventral median celiotomy.","Witte, Thomas H; Wilke, Markus; Stahl, Christina; Jandová, Vendula; Haralambus, Rhea; Straub, Reto",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,305,5

To address these issues, the authors describe the evolution in the design and use of the eCLIPs (Endovascular Clip System) device, a novel hybrid stent-like assist device with flow diverter properties that was first described in 2008. METHODS A registry was established covering 13 international centers at which patients were treated with the second-generation eCLIPs device. Aneurysm morphology and rupture status, device neck coverage, coil retention, and procedural and late morbidity and mortality were recorded. For those patients who had undergone successful implantation more than 6 months earlier, the final imaging and clinical follow-up results and need for re-treatment were recorded. RESULTS Thirty-three patients were treated between June 2013 and September 2015. Twenty-five (76%) patients had successful placement of an eCLIPs device; 23 (92%) of these 25 patients had complete data. Eight cases of nondeployment occurred during the 1st year of use, consistent with a learning curve; no failures of deployment occurred thereafter. Two periprocedural transient ischemic attacks and 2 asymptomatic thrombotic events occurred. Twenty-one (91%) of 23 patients underwent follow-up at an average of 8 months (range 3-18 months); 9 (42.9%) of these 21 patients demonstrated an improvement in Raymond grade at follow-up; no cases of worsening Raymond grade were recorded, and 17 (81.0%) patients sustained a modified Raymond-Roy Classification class of I or II angiographic result at follow-up. Two delayed ruptures were recorded, both in previously coiled, symptomatic giant aneurysms where the device was used as a part of a salvage strategy. CONCLUSIONS The second-generation eCLIPs device is a viable treatment option for bifurcation aneurysms. The aneurysm occlusion rates in this initial clinical series are comparable to the initial experience with other bifurcation support devices.","Chiu, Albert H; De Vries, Joost; O'Kelly, Cian J; Riina, Howard; McDougall, Ian; Tippett, Jonathan; Wan, Martina; de Oliveira Manoel, Airton Leonardo; Marotta, Thomas R",Journal of neurosurgery,305,12

In the present study, two spices, Trachyspermum ammi and Cinnamomum verum, been identified as excellent Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (PTPases) sources that play significant role in the regulation of cell signal transduction and developmental processes in plants as well as animals, being lucrative and potential targets for pharmacological modulation. PTPases from both cases were partially purified into 0%-40% and 40%-80% fractions based on ammonium sulfate saturation levels. Fraction (40%-80%) exhibited a purification level of 4.44-fold and 2.86-fold with specific activity of 44.06 and 23.33 U/mg for PTPases from T. ammi and C. verum, respectively. PTPases being found to be thermally stable up to 70°C imply their industrial significance. Kinetic studies showed Km values to be 7.14 and 8.33 mM, whereas the activation energy (Ea ) values were 25.89 and 29.13 kJ/mol, respectively. Divalent cations: Cu2+ , Zn2+ , and Mn2+ acted as inhibitors of PTPases, from both sources. The Ki values of inhibitors varied from 0.014-0.125 mM in the descending order Cu2+ > Zn2+ > Mn2+ and Mn2+ > Cu2+ > Zn2+ for PTPases from T. ammi and C. verum, respectively. The inhibitory effect of sodium metavanadate aligns with prominent PTPase characteristics. In addition to these properties, the thermostability of PTPases from two spices enhances their significance in industries with therapeutically vital products. Although the source of PTPases is culinary spices, further studies are required to establish the utilization of PTPases as nutraceuticals and in therapeutic formulations. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: For a healthy lifestyle, awareness needs to be created by humankind towards food habits to minimize illnesses. Numerous studies have explored the consumption of nutraceutical products acts as a natural barrier and immune booster for various human ailments including SARS-COV-2. PTPases play important roles in regulating intracellular signaling and, ultimately, biological function along with their structural features. The importance of PTPases and their inhibitors has been implicated in various diseases like cancer, diabetes, and obesity. Further investigations need to be undertaken to explore the therapeutic properties of PTPases in both in vivo and in vitro for their clinical significance.","Selvaraj, Kanagarethinam; Katare, Deepshikha Pande; Chand, Subhash; Chaudhary, Nidhee",Journal of food biochemistry,305,16

As the treatment of UIAs is aimed at preventing the possibility of rupture, the immediate risk of treatment must be weighed against the risk of rupture in the future. As such, treatment for a large proportion of UIAs is currently individualized. AREAS COVERED In this article, we discuss the important natural history studies of UIAs and discuss the existing scientific evidence and recent advances that help identify the rupture risk guide management of UIAs. We also address the recent advances in pharmacological therapy of UIAs. Expert commentary: In the recent years, there have been great advances in understanding the pathophysiology of UIAs and determining the rupture risk going beyond the traditional parameter of aneurysm size. Aneurysm morphology and hemodynamics play a pivotal role in growth and rupture. A true randomized trial for the management of UIAs is the need of the hour.","Ambekar, Sudheer; Khandelwal, Priyank; Bhattacharya, Pallab; Watanabe, Mitsuyoshi; Yavagal, Dileep R",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,305,16

DESIGN AND METHODS The time interval between February 2020 and March 2021 was divided into three different periods and we reported the evolution of our safety protocol, the changes in our daily activities and the rates of Sars-CoV-2 infection among the healthcare workers (HCW) of the Angiographic Suite. Personnel who had positive partners/family members or who had established close contacts of another nature outside the workplace were excluded from the study, in order to reduce any bias. RESULTS A total of 35 HCWs served in 355 patient procedures on Sars-CoV-2 positive patients from February 2020 to March 2021. During the year there was a reduction in the morbidity rate first from 7.9% to 1.4% and then currently reaching 0%. CONCLUSIONS Dedicated routes, elevators, establishing Filter Areas and a clear demarcation between clean and contaminated areas, Dressing and undressing procedures, Cleaning procedures and the obligation to always wear a surgical mask during the working shift are essential to prevent in-hospital infection.

The rapidity of weight loss after bariatric surgery provides an opportunity to identify the molecular changes associated with effective obesity treatment. Indirectly, this may provide some insights into the mechanisms that drive the association between obesity and cancer. We sought to measure circulating cancer-associated proteins before and after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). METHODS We prospectively enrolled 15 patients undergoing LSG. Thirty-four plasma protein biomarkers thought to be associated with cancer processes were analyzed at baseline and following successful weight loss at 12 weeks using a multiplex bead-based assay. RESULTS Mean excess body weight loss was 44 % at 12-week follow-up. After LSG, a significant reduction in circulating plasma levels was observed for half (17/34) of the proteins assessed: VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, endoglin, PLGF, sFASL, IGFBP-1, IL-18, prolactin, EGF, TGFα, sCD40L, IL-18, TNFα, IL-6, HB-EGF, and PAI-1. Nonsignificant decreases were found for the remaining proteins. CONCLUSIONS Circulating cancer-related biomarker levels were reduced by surgical weight loss, and this benefit was achieved as early as 3 months after operation. The observed reduction in cancer biomarkers may be related to the reported decrease in cancer incidence following bariatric surgery.","Farey, John Edward; Fisher, Oliver M; Levert-Mignon, Angelique J; Forner, Patrice M; Lord, Reginald V",Obesity surgery,305,25

We therefore designed the DIabetic REtinopathy Candesartan Trials (DIRECT) Programme to assess whether candesartan could reduce the incidence and progression of retinopathy in type 1 diabetes. METHODS Two randomised, double-blind, parallel-design, placebo-controlled trials were done in 309 centres worldwide. Participants with normotensive, normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetes without retinopathy were recruited to the DIRECT-Prevent 1 trial and those with existing retinopathy were recruited to DIRECT-Protect 1, and were assigned to candesartan 16 mg once a day or matching placebo. After 1 month, the dose was doubled to 32 mg. Investigators and participants were unaware of the treatment allocation status. The primary endpoints were incidence and progression of retinopathy and were defined as at least a two-step and at least a three-step increase on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale, respectively. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00252733 for DIRECT-Prevent 1 and NCT00252720 for DIRECT-Protect 1. FINDINGS 1421 participants (aged 18-50 years) were randomly assigned to candesartan (n=711) or to placebo (n=710) in DIRECT-Prevent 1, and 1905 (aged 18-55 years) to candesartan (n=951) or to placebo (n=954) in DIRECT-Protect 1. Incidence of retinopathy was seen in 178 (25%) participants in the candesartan group versus 217 (31%) in the placebo group. Progression of retinopathy occurred in 127 (13%) participants in the candesartan group versus 124 (13%) in the placebo group. Hazard ratio (HR for candesartan vs placebo) was 0.82 (95% CI 0.67-1.00, p=0.0508) for incidence of retinopathy and 1.02 (0.80-1.31, p=0.85) for progression of retinopathy. The post-hoc outcome of at least a three-step increase for incidence yielded an HR of 0.65 (0.48-0.87, p=0.0034), which was attenuated but still significant after adjustment for baseline characteristics (0.71, 0.53-0.95, p=0.046).

Adverse events did not differ between the treatment groups.

The array of injuries caused by this virus is broad and not limited to the respiratory system, but encompassing also extensive endothelial and systemic tissue damage. Since statins effectively improve endothelial function, these drugs may have beneficial effects in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, this investigation aimed to provide an updated overview on the interplay between statins and COVID-19, with particular focus on their potentially protective role against progression toward severe or critical illness and death. A systematic electronic search was performed in Scopus and PubMed up to present time. Data on statins use and COVID-19 outcomes especially in studies performed in Europe and North America were extracted and pooled. A total of seven studies met our inclusion criteria, totaling 2,398 patients (1,075 taking statins, i.e., 44.8%). Overall, statin usage in Western patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was associated with nearly 40% lower odds of progressing toward severe illness or death (odds ratio: 0.59; 95% confidence interval: 0.35-0.99). After excluding studies in which statin therapy was started during hospital admission, the beneficial effect of these drugs was magnified (odds ratio: 0.51; 95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.64). In conclusion, although randomized trials would be necessary to confirm these preliminary findings, current evidence would support a favorable effect of statins as adjuvant therapy in patients with COVID-19. Irrespective of these considerations, suspension of statin therapy seems highly unadvisable in COVID-19 patients.","Onorato, Diletta; Pucci, Mairi; Carpene, Giovanni; Henry, Brandon Michael; Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian; Lippi, Giuseppe",Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,305,19

Here, we questioned how the competition between immune responses to two viruses in the same naive host would influence the development of CD8 T cell memory and subsequent disease outcome upon challenge. Using two different models of coinfection, including the well-studied lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV) and Pichinde (PICV) viruses, several differences were observed within the CD8 T cell responses to either virus. Compared to single-virus infection, coinfection resulted in substantial variation among mice in the size of epitope-specific T cell responses to each virus. Some mice had an overall reduced number of virus-specific cells to either one of the viruses, and other mice developed an immunodominant response to a normally subdominant, cross-reactive epitope (nucleoprotein residues 205 to 212, or NP205). These changes led to decreased protective immunity and enhanced pathology in some mice upon challenge with either of the original coinfecting viruses. In mice with PICV-dominant responses, during a high-dose challenge with LCMV clone 13, increased immunopathology was associated with a reduced number of LCMV-specific effector memory CD8 T cells. In mice with dominant cross-reactive memory responses, during challenge with PICV increased immunopathology was directly associated with these cross-reactive NP205-specific CD8 memory cells. In conclusion, the inherent competition between two simultaneous immune responses results in significant alterations in T cell immunity and subsequent disease outcome upon reexposure. IMPORTANCE Combination vaccines and simultaneous administration of vaccines are necessary to accommodate required immunizations and maintain vaccination rates. Antibody responses generally correlate with protection and vaccine efficacy. However, live attenuated vaccines also induce strong CD8 T cell responses, and the impact of these cells on subsequent immunity, whether beneficial or detrimental, has seldom been studied, in part due to the lack of known T cell epitopes to vaccine viruses. We questioned if the inherent increased competition and stochasticity between two immune responses during a simultaneous coinfection would significantly alter CD8 T cell memory in a mouse model where CD8 T cell epitopes are clearly defined. We show that some of the coinfected mice have sufficiently altered memory T cell responses that they have decreased protection and enhanced immunopathology when reexposed to one of the two viruses. These data suggest that a better understanding of human T cell responses to vaccines is needed to optimize immunization strategies.","Kenney, Laurie L; Cornberg, Markus; Chen, Alex T; Emonet, Sebastien; de la Torre, Juan Carlos; Selin, Liisa K",Journal of virology,305,1

Here we assessed the efficacy and safety of ivabradine prolonged-release (PR) once-daily (test) vs. ivabradine immediate-release (IR) twice-daily (reference) formulations in patients with stable chronic HF with systolic dysfunction. METHODS Patients with sinus rhythm and heart rate (HR) ≥ 50 bpm, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40% (HF with reduced ejection fraction), on guideline-based standard care, receiving a stable dose of ivabradine IR 5/7.5 mg twice daily for ≥ 1 month were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 non-inferiority study. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to ivabradine PR (10 mg/15 mg) based on the ivabradine IR dosage or continued ivabradine IR (5 mg/7.5 mg). The primary endpoint was change in resting ECG HR from baseline to the end of 3 months, assessed by 12-lead ECG. Safety assessments and 24-h Holter HR monitoring (in a subgroup of patients) were also performed. Non-inferiority was concluded if the upper limit of the 95% CI of the difference between the test and reference was less than the margin of 6.5 bpm in the per-protocol set. RESULTS A total of 169 out of 180 randomized patients (93.9%) completed the study (PR = 84; IR = 85). The least-square mean (standard error [SE]) for change in HR from baseline to 3 months was 0.76 (1.188; 95% CI -1.59:3.11) in ivabradine PR vs. ivabradine IR, which was within the pre-specified margin of 6.5 bpm, confirming the non-inferiority of ivabradine PR. The change from baseline to 3 months was comparable between the treatment groups for 24-h Holter ECG monitoring (p = 0.3701), mean HR awake (p = 0.3423), and mean HR asleep (p = 0.1501). Thirty-nine treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported; the majority in both groups were of mild or moderate severity and were subsequently resolved. Seven serious adverse events were reported (ivabradine PR = 2; ivabradine IR = 5), of which one was fatal (ivabradine IR group). The bradycardia events reported were comparable between groups. CONCLUSION Ivabradine PR was found to be non-inferior to ivabradine IR in the management of patients with stable CHF, with a comparable safety profile. Once-daily ivabradine PR effectively maintained the HR in patients shifted from the ivabradine IR twice-daily regimen, and thus may aid in improving treatment compliance.

In turn, viruses have evolved a wide variety of strategies to hide from, and to directly antagonize, the host innate immune pathways. One of these pathways is the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L pathway. OAS is activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to produce 2'-5' oligoadenylates, which are the activators of RNase L; this enzyme degrades viral and cellular RNAs, restricting viral infection. It has been recently found that the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of rotavirus VP3 has a 2'-5'-phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity that is able to functionally substitute for the PDE activity of the mouse hepatitis virus ns2 protein. This particular phosphodiesterase cleaves the 2'-5'-phosphodiester bond of the oligoadenylates, antagonizing the OAS/RNase L pathway. However, whether this activity of VP3 is relevant during the replication cycle of rotavirus is not known. Here, we demonstrate that after rotavirus infection the OAS/RNase L complex becomes activated; however, the virus is able to control its activity using at least two distinct mechanisms. A virus-cell interaction that occurs during or before rotavirus endocytosis triggers a signal that prevents the early activation of RNase L, while later on the control is taken by the newly synthesized VP3. Cosilencing the expression of VP3 and RNase L in infected cells yields viral infectious particles at levels similar to those obtained in control infected cells, where no genes were silenced, suggesting that the capping activity of VP3 is not essential for the formation of infectious viral particles. IMPORTANCE Rotaviruses represent an important cause of severe gastroenteritis in the young of many animal species, including humans. In this work, we have found that the OAS/RNase L pathway is activated during rotavirus infection, but the virus uses two different strategies to prevent the deleterious effects of this innate immune response of the cell. Early during virus entry, the initial interactions of the viral particle with the cell result in the inhibition of RNase L activity during the first hours of the infection. Later on, once viral proteins are synthesized, the phosphodiesterase activity of VP3 degrades the cellular 2'-5'-oligoadenylates, which are potent activators of RNase L, preventing its activation. This work demonstrates that the OAS/RNase L pathway plays an important role during infection and that the phosphodiesterase activity of VP3 is relevant during the replication cycle of the virus.","Sánchez-Tacuba, Liliana; Rojas, Margarito; Arias, Carlos F; López, Susana",Journal of virology,305,1

Some delay is necessary, but recent delays have been extended by insufficient surveillance capacity and time-consuming efforts to mobilize action. Three public health emergencies of international concern (PHEICs)-H1N1, Ebola, and Zika-allow us to identify and compare sources of delays and consider seven hypotheses about what influences the length of delays. These hypotheses can then motivate further research that empirically tests them. The three PHEICs suggest that deferred global mobilization is a greater source of delay than is poor surveillance capacity. These case study outbreaks support hypotheses that we see quicker responses for novel diseases when outbreaks do not coincide with holidays and when US citizens are infected. They do not support hypotheses that we see quicker responses for more severe outbreaks or those that threaten larger numbers of people.

RECENT FINDINGS Signals provided by esophageal catheters (pressure or electromyogram) are the most reliable and accurate instruments to detect asynchronies. Esophageal signals (providing electrical activity of the diaphragm or/and esophageal pressure) have allowed the recent description of reverse triggering, a new kind of asynchrony, in which mechanical insufflation repeatedly triggers diaphragmatic contractions. However, the use of esophageal catheters is not widespread, and data on the prevalence and consequences of asynchronies are still scarce. The development of software solutions that continuously and automatically record breathing waveforms from the ventilator recording is emerging. Using this technology, recent data support the fact that asynchronies are frequent and may be negatively associated with outcome. SUMMARY The prevalence and consequences of asynchronies may be largely underestimated because of a frequent lack of monitoring. Dedicated software solutions that continuously and automatically detect asynchronies may allow both clinical research and clinical applications aimed at determining the effects of asynchronies and minimizing their incidence among critically ill patients.","Dres, Martin; Rittayamai, Nuttapol; Brochard, Laurent",Current opinion in critical care,305,16

We investigated the prognosis of asthma in former residents of temporary housing after allergen avoidance. METHODS Asthma was diagnosed in adults ≥ 15 years from 2014 to 2019 who had lived in temporary housing in Ishinomaki City for at least 1 year. The disease prognosis after the intervention of allergen avoidance in cases that were followed for more than 3 years during the 6-year study period was analyzed. We measured the Dermatophagoides farinae -specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in serum, and the amount of Dermatophagoides group 1 (Der 1) antigen on their futons or mattresses. We instructed residents in an allergen avoidance strategy that included 32 tasks, including using microfiber bedding covers. RESULTS Of the 202 examinees who were followed for at least 3 years during the 6-year study period, 72(35.6%) were asthmatic during at least one examination. Of these 72 asthmatics, 55(76.4%) developed the disease after the earthquake, and more than half of the cases that we diagnosed at the examination were mild intermittent asthma. After the allergen-avoidance intervention, both the Der 1 level on the futons or mattresses of residents who were diagnosed with asthma but who were nonasthmatic at the final screening and their serum Der f-specific IgE levels significantly decreased (P < 0.01) at the final examination.

None of these has proven superiority compared with the classical clamp-crushing technique. This randomized clinical trial compared the effectiveness and safety of stapler transection with that of clamp-crushing during open liver resection. METHODS Patients admitted for elective open liver resection between January 2010 and October 2011 were assigned randomly to stapler transection or the clamp-crushing technique. The primary endpoint was the total amount of intraoperative blood loss. Secondary endpoints included transection time, duration of operation, complication rates and resection margins. RESULTS A total of 130 patients were enrolled, 65 to clamp-crushing and 65 to stapler transection. There was no difference between groups in total intraoperative blood loss: median (i.q.r.) 1050 (525-1650) versus 925 (450-1425) ml respectively (P = 0·279). The difference in total intraoperative blood loss normalized to the transection surface area was not statistically significant (P = 0·092). Blood loss during parenchymal transection was significantly lower in the stapler transection group (P = 0·002), as were the parenchymal transection time (mean(s.d.) 30(21) versus 9(7) min for clamp-crushing and stapler transection groups respectively; P < 0·001) and total duration of operation (mean(s.d.) 221(86) versus 190(85) min; P = 0·047). There were no significant differences in postoperative morbidity (P = 0·863) or mortality (P = 0·684) between groups.

This concept often requires patients to be transferred to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) offering MT. Do patient referral, transportation, and logistic effort translate into clinical outcomes comparable to patients admitted primarily to the CSC? MATERIAL AND METHODS We categorized 112 patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation, who received MT at our institution, into primary admissions (A) and referrals from either local (B) or regional (C) hospitals, assessed the clinical outcome, and tested the impact of distance and delay of transportation from the referring remote hospital. RESULTS The median time from symptom onset to initial CT was similar in all groups (p = 0,939). Patients who were transferred to the CSC had significantly increasing median time between initial CT and MT (in minutes (interquartile range [IQR]); A: 83 [68-120]; B: 174 [159-208]; C: 220 [181-235]; p < 0.001) and median time between onset to MT (in minutes [IQR]; A: 178 [150-210]; B: 274 [238-349]; C: 293 [256-329]; p < 0.001).

Unlike other tumors that may benefit from timely receipt of definitive therapy, it is generally accepted that treatment delays for localized PCa are acceptable, especially for low-risk PCa. Since treatment delay for intermediate-risk and high-risk disease is more controversial, we sought to determine if delays for these disease states negatively impacted oncological outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a systematic review of the literature with searches of Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, from inception to June 30, 2020. General study characteristics as well as study population and delay information were collected. The outcomes of interest extracted included biochemical recurrence (BCR), pathological features (positive surgical margins, upgrading, extracapsular extension, and other pathological features), cancer-specific surgical (CSS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS After identifying 1793 unique references, 24 manuscripts met criteria for data extraction, 15 of which were published after 2013. Based on our review, delays up to 3 months are safe for all PCa and are not associated with worse oncological outcomes. Some studies identified worse oncological outcomes as a result of delays beyond 6 to 9 months. However, these studies are counterbalanced by others finding no statistically significant association with delays up to 12 months. Studies that did find worse outcomes as result of delays identified a higher risk of BCR and worse pathological outcomes, but not worse cancer-specific or OS. CONCLUSIONS Definitive treatment for intermediate-risk and high-risk PCa can be delayed up to 3 months without any oncological consequences. Some evidence suggests that there is a higher risk of BCR and worse pathological outcomes associated with delays beyond 6-9 months. To date, there are no reports of worse CSS or OS as a result of delayed treatment for intermediate-risk and high-risk PCa.","Nguyen, David-Dan; Haeuser, Lorine; Paciotti, Marco; Reitblat, Chanan; Cellini, Jacqueline; Lipsitz, Stuart R; Kibel, Adam S; Choudhury, Atish D; Cone, Eugene B; Trinh, Quoc-Dien",The Journal of urology,305,31

The discovery of late health effects in adulthood prompted investigation of the medical aspects of irradiation in childhood and led to the establishment of strict protocols for the use of X-ray irradiation. These studies ignored alopecia, which affects some individuals who underwent irradiation for scalp ringworm as children. This study examined the impact of alopecia due to irradiation for scalp ringworm on the health and psychosocial status of affected women. METHODS We analysed a random sample of 130 medical files of women recognised by Israel's state committees as suffering from permanent hair loss as a result of scalp ringworm irradiation in childhood. The coded medical data included demographic variables, self-reported mental health conditions, self-reported physical health conditions, self-reported social conditions, and spousal relationship. RESULTS Compared with the general population of women in Israel, research participants reported significantly higher rates of depression, anti-depressant and/or anti-anxiety drug use, psychotherapy or psychiatric hospitalisation, attempted suicide, migraines, cancer, and divorce. Many described humiliating social experiences due to their appearance, both in childhood and adulthood, that led them to curtail their social interactions. The participants also reported that alopecia negatively affected their spousal relationships. CONCLUSIONS Life with hair loss from scalp ringworm irradiation in childhood has a negative impact on women's health status and psychosocial state. Health policy-makers must broaden their approach to women who underwent scalp ringworm irradiation by addressing the effects of their hair loss in addition to the effects of the radiation treatment per se. This may be achieved by guiding physicians who provide medical services to these women to take into account the psychosocial and health risks related to hair loss in their diagnosis and treatment as well as by creating a cadre of specially trained mental health professionals who can address their unique psychosocial needs. They must also consider including the specialized mental health services tailored for these women's unique needs in the Healthcare Basket.","Hoffer, Liat; Shvarts, Shifra; Segal-Engelchin, Dorit",Israel journal of health policy research,305,1

METHODS This study compared the mechanical strength of eight different ICD fixation techniques (purse string, 'Roman sandal', 'Jo'burg' (JO) technique, a suture through the tube, one and two passes through a locking plastic tie, tape fixation and a commercial disposable drainage tube holder) and two silk suture sizes using porcine cadavers and a digital push-pull dynamometer to simulate accidental removal of an ICD. A total of 14 different experimental set-ups produced 280 measurements. RESULTS Significant differences in ICD fixation strength were observed. A modified JO technique using a size 1 silk suture was nearly three times stronger than a purse-string fixation using a size 0 silk and 10 times stronger from a commercial, adhesive-based device (180, 70 and 22, respectively).

The role of NDV V protein in virus-production kinetics was investigated using DF-1 cell-based production system. The presence of an anti-interferon (IFN)-alpha antibody resulted in enhanced NDV production kinetics in a dose-dependent manner by blocking binding of NDV-induced IFN to its receptor. To prepare DF-1 cell whose cellular IFN signaling is blocked efficiently, stable cell lines expressing either lentogenic or velogenic NDV V protein known as an IFN antagonist were established. The overexpression of NDV V protein enhanced NDV production kinetics and expedited the rate of NDV production, while it had no effect on Japanese encephalitis virus production. NDV V protein functions as an IFN antagonist by inhibiting the increase in type I IFNs by NDV infection. The IFN signals in cells expressing NDV V protein were weakened by decreased activation or expression of the dsRNA-activated enzymes. These IFN antagonist activities enhance rapid virus replication and spread in the early phase of viral infection and will be useful in improving the production of viral vaccine strains.","Jang, Juno; Hong, Sung-Hwan; Choi, Dongwon; Choi, Kang-Seuk; Kang, Seongman; Kim, Ik-Hwan",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,305,9

Although rare in adults, severe lower respiratory adenovirus infections including pneumonia are reported in specific populations, such as military recruits and immunocompromised patients. Antiviral treatment is challenging due to limited clinical experience and lack of well-controlled randomized trials. Several previously reported cases of adenoviral pneumonia showed promising efficacy of cidofovir. However, few reports discussed the efficacy of cidofovir in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We experienced 3 cases of adenoviral pneumonia associated with ARDS and treated with cidofovir and respiratory support, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). All 3 patients showed a positive clinical response to cidofovir and survival at 28 days. Cidofovir with early ECMO therapy may be a therapeutic option in adenoviral ARDS.

COVID-19 presents a high mortality rate, estimated at 3.4%. More than 1 out of 4 hospitalized COVID-19 patients require admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for respiratory support, and a large proportion of these ICU-COVID-19 patients, between 17% and 46%, have died. In these patients COVID-19 infection causes an inflammatory response in the lungs that can progress to inflammation with cytokine storm, Acute Lung Injury (ALI), Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), thromboembolic events, disseminated intravascular coagulation, organ failure, and death. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are potent immunomodulatory cells that recognize sites of injury, limit effector T cell reactions, and positively modulate regulatory cell populations. MSCs also stimulate local tissue regeneration via paracrine effects inducing angiogenic, anti-fibrotic and remodeling responses. MSCs can be derived in large number from the Umbilical Cord (UC). UC-MSCs, utilized in the allogeneic setting, have demonstrated safety and efficacy in clinical trials for a number of disease conditions including inflammatory and immune-based diseases. UC-MSCs have been shown to inhibit inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs and have been utilized to treat patients with severe COVID-19 in pilot, uncontrolled clinical trials, that reported promising results. UC-MSCs processed at our facility have been authorized by the FDA for clinical trials in patients with an Alzheimer's Disease, and in patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). We hypothesize that UC-MSC will also exert beneficial therapeutic effects in COVID-19 patients with cytokine storm and ARDS. We propose an early phase controlled, randomized clinical trial in COVID-19 patients with ALI/ARDS. Subjects in the treatment group will be treated with two doses of UC-MSC (l00 × 106 cells). The first dose will be infused within 24 hours following study enrollment. A second dose will be administered 72 ± 6 hours after the first infusion. Subject in the control group will receive infusion of vehicle (DPBS supplemented with 1% HSA and 70 U/kg unfractionated Heparin, delivered IV) following the same timeline. Subjects will be evaluated daily during the first 6 days, then at 14, 28, 60, and 90 days following enrollment (see Schedule of Assessment for time window details). Safety will be determined by adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) during the follow-up period. Efficacy will be defined by clinical outcomes, as well as a variety of pulmonary, biochemical and immunological tests. Success of the current study will provide a framework for larger controlled, randomized clinical trials and a means of accelerating a possible solution for this urgent but unmet medical need. The proposed early phase clinical trial will be performed at the University of Miami (UM), in the facilities of the Diabetes Research Institute (DRI), UHealth Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the Clinical Translational Research Site (CTRS) at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and at the Jackson Memorial Hospital (JMH).","Lanzoni, G; Linetsky, E; Correa, D; Alvarez, R A; Marttos, A; Hirani, K; Cayetano, S Messinger; Castro, J G; Paidas, M J; Efantis Potter, J; Xu, X; Glassberg, M; Tan, J; Patel, A N; Goldstein, B; Kenyon, N S; Baidal, D; Alejandro, R; Vianna, R; Ruiz, P; Caplan, A I; Ricordi, C","CellR4-- repair, replacement, regeneration, & reprogramming",305,8

A previous study demonstrated a high sensitivity of a phocid, the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina), in discriminating time intervals. In the present study, we compared the harbour seal's timing abilities with the timing abilities of an otariid, the South African fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus). This comparison seemed essential as phocids and otariids differ in many respects and might, thus, also differ regarding their timing abilities. We determined time difference thresholds for sub- and suprasecond time intervals marked by a white circle on a black background displayed for a specific time interval on a monitor using a staircase method. Contrary to our expectation, the timing abilities of the fur seal and the harbour seal were comparable. Over a broad range of time intervals, 0.8-7 s in the fur seal and 0.8-30 s in the harbour seal, the difference thresholds followed Weber's law. In this range, both animals could discriminate time intervals differing only by 12 % and 14 % on average. Timing might, thus be a fundamental cue for pinnipeds in general to be used in various contexts, thereby complementing information provided by classical sensory systems. Future studies will help to clarify if timing is indeed involved in foraging decisions or the estimation of travel speed or distance.","Heinrich, Tamara; Ravignani, Andrea; Hanke, Frederike D",Animal cognition,305,20

METHODS We identified opioid prescriptions dispensed to children and young adults in 2019 in the IQVIA Longitudinal Prescription Database, which captures 92% of US pharmacies. We calculated the proportion of all US children and young adults with ≥1 dispensed opioid prescription in 2019. We calculated performance on 6 metrics of high-risk prescribing and the proportion of prescriptions written by each specialty. Of all prescriptions and those classified as high risk by ≥1 metric, we calculated the proportion written by high-volume prescribers with prescription counts at the ≥95th percentile. RESULTS Analyses included 4 027 701 prescriptions. In 2019, 3.5% of US children and young adults had ≥1 dispensed opioid prescription. Of prescriptions for opioid-naive patients, 41.8% and 3.8% exceeded a 3-day and 7-day supply, respectively. Of prescriptions for young children, 8.4% and 7.7% were for codeine and tramadol. Of prescriptions for adolescents and young adults, 11.5% had daily dosages of ≥50 morphine milligram equivalents; 4.6% had benzodiazepine overlap. Overall, 45.6% of prescriptions were high risk by ≥1 metric. Dentists and surgeons wrote 61.4% of prescriptions. High-volume prescribers wrote 53.3% of prescriptions and 53.1% of high-risk prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS Almost half of pediatric opioid prescriptions are high risk. To reduce high-risk prescribing, initiatives targeting high-volume prescribers may be warranted. However, broad-based initiatives are also needed to address the large share of high-risk prescribing attributable to other prescribers.","Chua, Kao-Ping; Brummett, Chad M; Conti, Rena M; Bohnert, Amy S",Pediatrics,305,1

However, extensive preparation time, cleaning, and limited long-term stability of conventional gel-based electrode systems pose significant limitations in out-of-the-lab conditions. Dry electrode systems may contribute to rapid and repetitive mobile EEG acquisition with significantly reduced preparation time, reduced cleaning requirements, and possible self-application by the volunteer but are known for higher channel failure probability and increased sensitivity to movement artifacts. We performed a counterbalanced repeated measure endurance cycling study to objectively validate the performance and applicability of a novel commercially available 64-channel dry electrode cap for sport science. A total of 17 healthy volunteers participated in the study, performing an endurance cycling paradigm comprising five phases: (I) baseline EEG, (II) pre-cycling EEG, (III) endurance cycling, (IV) active recovery, and (V) passive recovery. We compared the performance of the 64-channel dry electrode cap with a commercial gel-based cap system in terms of usability metrics, reliability, and signal characteristics. Furthermore, we validated the performance of the dry cap during a realistic sport science investigation, verifying the hypothesis of a systematic, reproducible shift of the individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF) induced by physical effort. The average preparation time of the dry cap was one-third of the gel-based electrode caps. The average channel reliability of the dry cap varied between 80 ± 15% (Phase I), 66 ± 19% (Phase III), and 91 ± 10% (Phase V). In comparison, the channel reliability of the gel-based cap varied between 95 ± 3, 85 ± 9, and 82 ± 9%, respectively. No considerable differences were evident for the comfort evaluations nor the signal characteristics of both caps. A within-volunteers repeated measure analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) did not show significant effects of the electrode type on the iAPF [F(1,12) = 1.670, p = 0.221, η p 2 = 0.122, Power = 0.222]. However, a significant increase of the iAPF exists from Phase II to Phases IV and V due to exhaustive physical task. In conclusion, we demonstrated that dry electrode cap is equivalent to the gel-based electrode cap based on signal characteristics, comfort, and signal information content, thereby confirming the usefulness of dry electrodes in sports science and other mobile applications involving ample movement.","di Fronso, Selenia; Fiedler, Patrique; Tamburro, Gabriella; Haueisen, Jens; Bertollo, Maurizio; Comani, Silvia",Frontiers in neuroscience,305,29

We hypothesized that antiretroviral therapy alters the maturation of oligodendrocytes which synthesize myelin. We tested whether specific frontline integrase strand transfer inhibitors would alter oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. To model the effect of antiretrovirals on oligodendrocytes, we stimulated primary rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes in vitro in the presence of therapeutically relevant concentrations of elvitegravir or raltegravir and then assessed differentiation with lineage specific markers. To examine the effect of antiretrovirals on myelination, we treated mice with the demyelinating compound cuprizone, for 5 weeks. This was followed by 3 weeks of recovery in absence of cuprizone, during which time some mice received a daily intrajugular injection of elvitegravir. Brains were harvested, sectioned and processed by immunohistochemistry to examine oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination. Elvitegravir inhibited oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner, while raltegravir had no effect. Following cuprizone demyelination, administration of elvitegravir to adult mice reduced remyelination compared with control animals. Elvitegravir treatment activated the integrated stress response in oligodendrocytes in vitro, an effect which was completely blocked by pretreatment with the integrated stress response inhibitor Trans-ISRIB, preventing elvitegravir-mediated inhibition of oligodendrocyte maturation. These studies demonstrate that elvitegravir impairs oligodendrocyte maturation and remyelination and that the integrated stress response mediates this effect and may be a possible therapeutic target.","Roth, Lindsay M; Zidane, Bassam; Festa, Lindsay; Putatunda, Raj; Romer, Micah; Monnerie, Hubert; Jordan-Sciutto, Kelly L; Grinspan, Judith B",Glia,305,4

The clinical manifestations of RSV are indistinguishable from other etiologies of acute respiratory infection. Therefore, accurate and timely laboratory testing is needed to impact clinical management. There are now multiple rapid, low-complexity, commercially available assays for RSV. These tests present significant performance advantages compared to older antigen detection tests. Accurate and rapid diagnosis of RSV has the potential for enabling timely cessation of unnecessary antibiotics and implementation of good infection control practices. Furthermore, a recently approved RSV diagnostic assay can reduce the test turnaround time to 13 min or less. Areas covered: The authors aim to review the importance of rapid and accurate testing for RSV and will describe the available molecular RSV diagnostic assays approved for use at the point-of-care. Expert commentary: Further independent evaluations are needed to confirm that the accuracy of the low-complexity assays is indeed similar to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction across the age spectrum, and in immunosuppressed hosts. In the future, the challenge will be to achieve a balance between increasingly sophisticated multiplex diagnostic platforms and tests that are sufficiently simple to be used at the point-of-care.","A Hogan, Catherine; Caya, Chelsea; Papenburg, Jesse",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,305,1

SUBJECTS AND METHODS Thirty patients (16 men and 14 women; mean age, 67 years) were prospectively recruited. Patients underwent three scans (one standard-dose scan and two low-dose scans at noise indexes [NIs] of 33, 60, and 70, respectively). All three scans were reconstructed with FBP, ASIR, and MBIR. Objective and subjective image qualities were compared. Dose-length products and effective doses for each scans were recorded. Mean image noise and attenuation values were compared between different reconstruction algorithms using repeated-measures analysis of variance and paired Student t tests. The interobserver variation between the two radiologists for subjective image quality and lesion assessment was estimated by using weighted kappa statistics. RESULTS Objective image analysis supports significant noise reduction with low-dose scans using the MBIR technique (p < 0.05). There was no significant change in mean CT numbers between different reconstructions (p > 0.05). Subjective analysis reveals no significant difference between image quality and diagnostic confidence between low-dose MBIR scans compared with standard-dose scans reconstructed using ASIR (p > 0.05). Average effective doses were 3.7, 1.2, and 0.9 mSv for standard scans at NIs of 33, 60, and 70, respectively. CONCLUSION MBIR shows superior noise reduction and improved image quality. Substantial dose reduction can be achieved by increasing the NI parameters as tested in this study without affecting image quality and diagnostic confidence.","Vardhanabhuti, Varut; Loader, Robert J; Mitchell, Grant R; Riordan, Richard D; Roobottom, Carl A",AJR.

While both students and educators have now somewhat settled into new teaching methods, from Zoom™ lectures to online tutorials, the adaption of clinical skills teaching to the virtual setting has lagged behind. As a result, many students have been left feeling anxious and concerned about practicing practical and communication skills that are central to being a competent and safe doctor. In light of this, medical students at the Queen's University Belfast General Practice (GP) Society organised a series of virtual, mock Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) for students in Years 2-5 conducted via Zoom™. Medical students and doctors acted as examiners and simulated patients (SPs) with 'breakout rooms' being used to simulate distinct OSCE stations. This collaborative project was well received by participants and doctors alike, who found the virtual OSCEs improved their confidence in performing key clinical skills and virtual consultations. As medical students ourselves, we gained early career exposure to designing and delivering assessments and developed transferable skills, relevant both to medicine and teaching. Lastly, the peer-led approach disrupted the traditional hierarchy in medical education.

Extant research has identified two distinct forms of death awareness: death anxiety and death reflection. Because researchers have exclusively examined death anxiety and death reflection as independent and unique variables across individuals while overlooking their interplay and co-existence within individuals, we know little about whether and why employees can have different combined experiences of two forms of death awareness over a certain period of time (e.g., during the pandemic), and how these different employee experiences relate to theoretically and practically important work-relevant consequences. To address this gap in our knowledge, we adopted a person-centered approach using latent profile analysis to consider death anxiety and death reflection conjointly within employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. Across two studies, we identified three distinct death awareness profiles-the disengaged, calm reflectors, and anxious reflectors-and found membership in these profiles systematically varied according to health- (e.g., risk of severe illness from COVID-19), work- (e.g., job-required human contact), and community-related (e.g., the number of regional infections) factors influencing the self-relevance of COVID-19 as a mortality cue. In addition, we found that these death awareness profiles differentially predicted important employee outcomes, including well-being (i.e., depression and emotional exhaustion) and prosocial behaviors at work (i.e., organizational citizenship behaviors and pro-diversity behavior).

Beside their rarity, their treatment is challenged by a high proportion of fusiform aneurysms, torturous course of PICA, and often severe bleeding. Our aim is to represent the characteristics of these aneurysms and their treatment, as well as to analyze outcome. METHODS We reviewed retrospectively 80 patients with PICA aneurysms who were treated at the Department of Neurosurgery, Helsinki, Finland. RESULTS The 80 patients had altogether 91 distal PICA aneurysms. Subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred in 74 (93%), and the distal PICA aneurysm was ruptured in 68 (85%). Compared with aneurysms at other locations, distal PICA aneurysms were smaller, more often fusiform, and more often caused an intraventricular hemorrhage as well as rebleeding. Modified surgical techniques (trapping, wrapping, proximal occlusion, resection, coagulation) were used in 10 (32%) fusiform and in 3 (6%) saccular aneurysms. Revascularization was needed in 3 (4%) cases. One aneurysm was primarily embolized. Within a year after aneurysm diagnosis, 18 patients had died. Among survivors, most returned to independent or previous state of living: 52 (91%); only 1 patient was unable to return home. CONCLUSIONS Microsurgery is a feasible treatment for distal PICA aneurysms. Despite the challenge of often severe hemorrhage, wide-necked aneurysms, and some risk for laryngeal palsy, most patients surviving the initial stage return to normal life. Because of the greater number of rebleedings than for aneurysms at other locations, immediate treatment is crucial.","Lehto, Hanna; Harati, Ali; Niemelä, Mika; Dashti, Reza; Laakso, Aki; Elsharkawy, Ahmed; Satopää, Jarno; Billon-Grand, Romain; Canato, Bruno; Kivisaari, Riku; Hernesniemi, Juha",World neurosurgery,305,29

METHOD AND MATERIALS An online questionnaire was distributed via social media among dental practitioners in Israel who worked during the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS In total, 144 dental practitioners completed the survey; it was found that dental practitioner adherence to all the official PPE use recommendations was 69.8%, whereas 36.8% of dental practitioners reported the use of N95 when needed. Knowledge of self-protection against COVID-19 was rated as ""very good"" by 37.5% of responders. However, only 25.7% felt ""highly protected"" by personal protective equipment. Interestingly, many dental practitioners (46.8%) reported adherence to extra protection in addition to the required PPE communicated by the Ministry of Health guidelines. CONCLUSION Stricter regimens should be applied for dealing with the current challenging pandemic, especially in clinical work with a higher risk for viral transmission. Specific strategies should be followed to ensure good practice to improve dental practitioners' and patients' safety.","Khoury Absawi, Mervat; Fahoum, Kholoud; Haim, Sarnat; Dror, Amiel A; Oren, Daniel; Kablan, Fares; Abramson, Alex; Srouji, Samer",Quintessence international,305,19

Current data show that many hospitalized COVID-19 patients suffer from kidney damage, in the form of proteinuria, hematuria or acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is especially prevalent among severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients and is a predictor of mortality. The pathophysiology of AKI in COVID-19 is unclear. Early reports of histopathologic examination from autopsied kidney tissue show SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in renal tubular cells and podocytes, suggesting direct viral infection, as well as findings of acute tubular necrosis, while rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI and glomerulopathies may also occur. As of today, only remdesivir has been authorized to treat COVID-19. Ongoing research investigates potential of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agents along with safety and efficacy of commonly prescribed drugs such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers. This review discusses the prevalence of AKI and its association with outcome, while highlighting possible mechanisms of AKI and suggesting organ protective measures to prevent the development of kidney damage.","Ertuğlu, Lale A; Kanbay, Asiye; Afşar, Barış; Elsürer Afşar, Rengin; Kanbay, Mehmet",Tuberkuloz ve toraks,305,16

From this data, it is illustrated that the HOMO-LUMO energy gap is -9.756 to -7.756 kcal/mol while the compound 12 shows the highest energy gap and compound 10 is opposite, and the softness has recorded the range from 0.208 to 0.255, showing a small difference, while the lower softness is picked up for 12, but 09 is reverse. The key and vital part of this study are noted as molecular docking against four pathogens proteins, such as Bacillus cereus, E Coli, Lanosterol 14alpha demethylase, SARS-02, and it is obtained the most expected and impactful result as an inhibitor. It is mentioned that the result of molecular docking score is -9.6 for compounds 09 and 11 against Bacillus cereus which is the highest score. But it is slightly different for E Coli -9.5 and -9.3 of compounds 10 and 07.

Apart from the vaccine, the only cure for this drastic disease is to follow the rules and regulations that avoid further spread. There are different mechanisms like (Social Distancing, Mask Detection, Human occupancy etc.) through which we can able to stop the spread of the coronavirus. In this paper, we proposed hotspot zone detection using the computer vision techniques of deep learning. We have defined the hotspot area as the particular region on which the person touches more than some specified threshold. We further mark that area to some specific color to help the authority take necessary action and disinfect that particular place. To implement this algorithm, we have utilized the human-object interaction concept. We have extracted the dataset of person classes from the publicly available dataset for the person detection and the self-generated dataset to train the algorithm. Different experiments on object detection algorithms (YOLO-v3, Faster RCNN, SSD) for person detection have been performed in this work. We achieved the maximum accuracy in real-time on the YOLO-v3 for person detection. Whereas we have marked the specific area using the template matching algorithm of computer vision techniques. Our proposed algorithm detects the persons and extracts the region of interest points on which the user draws the rectangle. Then we find the intersection over union ratio between the detected person and the region of interest of the marked area to make the decision. We have achieved 88.72% accuracy on person detection in the local environment. Whereas, for the whole system of human-object interaction for detecting the hotspot area zone, we have achieved 86.7% accuracy using the confusion matrix.","Khan, M. Z.; Khan, M. U.

This article describes five principles to guide and assist statistical agencies, mobile network operators and intermediary service providers, who are actively working on projects using mobile operator data to support governments in monitoring the effectiveness of its COVID-19 related interventions. These are principles of necessity and proportionality, of professional independence, of privacy protection, of commitment to quality, and of international comparability. Compliance with each of these principles can help maintain public trust in the handling of these sensitive data and their results, and therefore keep citizen support for government policies. Three projects (in Estonia, Ghana, and the Gambia) were described and reviewed with respect to the compliance and applicability of the five principles. Most attention was placed on privacy protection, somewhat at the expense of the quality of the compiled indicators. The necessity and proportionality in the choice of mobile operator data can be very well justified given the need for timely, frequent and granular indicators. Explicitly addressing the five principles in the preparation of a project should give confidence to the statistical agency and its partners, that enough care has been exercised in the set up and implementation of the project, and should convey trust to public and government in the use mobile operator data for policy purposes.","Jansen, Ronald Kovacs Karoly Siim Esko Saluveer Erki Sõstra Kaja Bengtsson Linus Li Tracey Adewole Wole A.; Nester, Jade Arai Ayumi Magpantay Esperanza",Data & Policy,305,1

In this study, we sought to investigate whether smoking could be an additional risk factor for hand eczema in nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Using a questionnaire about smoking details and hand eczema, we conducted a study among nurses involved in the frontline management of COVID-19 patients. A total of 1,000 questionnaires were sent out. The questionnaires were anonymous and based on self-reported answers, with no clinical examination or medical data evaluation. All nurses enrolled in the study were women, working in shifts for the last three months since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Two-hundred forty-seven questionnaires were accepted for the study, after eliminating non-responders and nurses without hand eczema. The majority of nurses denied smoking (87.85%) in the past and at the moment of the study. Statistics related to years of smoking and occurrence of hand eczema showed no increase in the number of cases in correlation with the number of years of smoking. Similarly, a random distribution of cases of hand eczema was observed when compared to the number of cigarettes per day. Conclusion: Our data does not support the hypothesis that smoking is an independent risk factor for the development of occupational hand eczema during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chiriac, A.

Mass vaccination has offered a route to reduce societal restrictions while protecting hospitals from being overwhelmed. Yet, early in the mass vaccination effort, the possible effect on future bed pressures remained subject to considerable uncertainty. This paper provides an account of how, in one healthcare system, operational decision-making and bed planning was supported through modelling the effect of a range of vaccination scenarios on future COVID-19 admissions. Methods: An epidemiological model of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) type was fitted to local data for the one-million resident healthcare system located in South West England. Model parameters and vaccination scenarios were calibrated through a system-wide multi-disciplinary working group, comprising public health intelligence specialists, healthcare planners, epidemiologists, and academics. From 4 March 2021 (the time of the study), scenarios assumed incremental relaxations to societal restrictions according to the envisaged UK Government timeline, with all restrictions to be removed by 21 June 2021. Results: Achieving 95% vaccine uptake in adults by 31 July 2021 would not avert a third wave in autumn 2021 but would produce a median peak bed requirement approximately 6% (IQR: 1% to 24%) of that experienced during the second wave (January 2021). A two-month delay in vaccine rollout would lead to significantly higher peak bed occupancy, at 66% (11% to 146%) of that of the second wave. If only 75% uptake was achieved (the amount typically associated with vaccination campaigns) then the second wave peak for acute and intensive care beds would be exceeded by 4% and 19% respectively, an amount which would seriously pressure hospital capacity. Conclusion: Modelling provided support to senior managers in setting the number of acute and intensive care beds to make available for COVID-19 patients, as well as highlighting the importance of public health in promoting high vaccine uptake among the population. Forecast accuracy has since been supported by actual data collected following the analysis, with observed peak bed occupancy falling comfortably within the inter-quartile range of modelled projections.","Booton, R.

The global impact of COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rapid growth and the use of mobile health applications. Certain measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease include contact tracing, testing, and isolation. The main aim of this survey was to assess knowledge and awareness among Indian citizens toward application to fight against COVID-19. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional, web-based survey conducted during the peak period of the pandemic to assess knowledge and awareness among 489 Indian citizens toward application to fight against COVID-19. Using Google Forms, an online semi-structured questionnaire with informed consent form was generated. The survey link was sent through online platforms such as WhatsApp, e-mails, and Facebook to the investigator contacts. Chi-square test was used to determine the level of association between the variables. Results: The survey results showed that out of 489 participants, 99.5% (P < 0.001) heard about COVID-19 apps. Majority of participants, that is, 84.5% and 81.8% believed that these apps helped to protect them and community from COVID-19 and helped in self-assessment test for infection mitigation, respectively.

It is in the country's best interest to make long-term capacity expansion plans, a strategy the developed countries banked to provide adequate healthcare facilities to their residents. However, no single solution is appropriate for a different region. Hence, it is required to comprehensively study the situation and constraints of the specific region before providing expensive capacity expansion plans.

Quite suddenly, politicians had to make drastic decisions to guarantee public health, affecting basic civil liberties. In justifying their decisions, politicians internationally reverted back to a direct staging of experts to legitimize their proposals for what internationally became known as the ""lockdown"". In this article we analyze the performance of the Dutch government that, early on, labeled its approach to COVID-19 as an ""intelligent lockdown"". Our analysis examines the dramaturgy of expertise during this period. We selected two interrelated ""stages"": the official press conferences, fully controlled by the government, and the responses on Twitter, as focal channel for critique from the general public, but also from opposition parties and (alleged) experts. 26 press conferences of the Dutch Prime Minister were analyzed and a search for the most popular posts on Twitter referring to the press conference(s) was carried out covering the period between March 6th and May 29th, 2020. The results show that the technocratic framing of expertise remained stable during the sampling period, regarding the undisputed status of expertise as the clear-cut basis for decision-making in uncertain times. Framing on Twitter challenged the omnipotence of the experts advising the government in various ways, namely, by referring to dissenting opinions of other experts, by questioning the underlying motives of experts' advice or by pointing out that the policies were clearly contrary to everyday experience. We argue that it is not so much the facts themselves that are at stake here but hidden moralities, which include the government's alleged complacency while asking citizens to blindly trust, its unpredictable behavior in the light of the promised straight line between scientific evidence and policy making, and its motivated behavior while claiming that the facts speak for themselves.","Prettner, R.; te Molder, H.; Hajer, M.

It shows a sense in which Visegrad and Balkan EU countries are correlated in macroeconomic performance and integrated with the global business cycles. Using inflation rate levels as a starting point to characterize when these countries began their transitions, it shows that after 1996 both real GDP growth and real interest rates move together to a significant degree both with each other and with the US. This provides a background from which to view the paths since the collapse of the Soviet Union that these transition economies have taken. In addition, comparison is made to US money and banking policy, to provide an outline of how this may impact progress in the transition region. A subsequent summary of the other articles in the issue shows an inter-relation in their themes about how Central, Eastern, and Southeast Europe have progressed since 1991, and how these paths may be affected by Western economic policy. Implications for Central European audience: The paper shows that transition regions can be impacted by international financial integration, including to possible detriment when capital markets are regulated by policy that pushes real interest rates below their natural levels. Negative real interest rate policy since the 2008-2009 financial crisis and again during the Covid crisis may hasten the rise of autocratic democracy and limit social, political, and economic freedom.","Gillman, M.",Central European Business Review,305,5

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the guide was expanded to support SCR in an online environment by highlighting virtual library services and electronic resources.

This increase may be a result of different events: a temporal decline of the vaccine's efficacy; Lower efficacy of the vaccine against the current Delta ( (B.1.617.2) variant (which is now the dominant strain in Israel); A result of lack of social restrictions, a highly contagious variant, or any combination of the above. We found, by using a novel spatial-dynamic model and recent {aggregate} data from Israel, that this new surge of cases is partiality due to a decline in the shielding of those who were vaccinated about six months ago. Also, we found a decrease in the vaccine's efficacy against severe morbidity for the early elderly population compared to the rest of the vaccinated population. These results, which are consistent with recent studies, emphasize the high ability of the model in evaluating the time- and age-dependent efficacy of the vaccine for different age groups and enables to predict the spread of the pandemic as a function of such efficacy.","De-Leon, H.; Pederiva, F.",,305,5

These data have revealed the emergence of lineages with mutations associated to transmissibility and antigenicity, known as variants of concern (VOCs). A striking aspect of VOCs is that many of them involve an unusually large number of defining mutations. Current phylogenetic estimates of the evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 suggest that its genome accrues around 2 mutations per month. However, VOCs can have around 15 defining mutations and it is hypothesised that they emerged over the course of a few months, implying that they must have evolved faster for a period of time. We analysed genome sequence data from the GISAID database to assess whether the emergence of VOCs can be attributed to changes in the evolutionary rate of the virus and whether this pattern can be detected at a phylogenetic level using genome data. We fit a range of molecular clock models and assessed their statistical fit. Our analyses indicate that the emergence of VOCs is driven by an episodic increase in the evolutionary rate of around 4-fold the background phylogenetic rate estimate that may have lasted several weeks or months. These results underscore the importance of monitoring the molecular evolution of the virus as a means of understanding the circumstances under which VOCs may emerge.","Tay, J. H.; Porter, A.

The authors have investigated a photon-counting spectral imaging system with two energy bins for contrast-enhanced mammography. System optimization and the potential benefit compared to conventional non-energy-resolved absorption imaging was studied. Methods: A framework for system characterization was set up that included quantum and anatomical noise and a theoretical model of the system was benchmarked to phantom measurements. Results: Optimal combination of the energy-resolved images corresponded approximately to minimization of the anatomical noise, which is commonly referred to as energy subtraction. In that case, an ideal-observer detectability index could be improved close to 50% compared to absorption imaging in the phantom study. Optimization with respect to the signal-to-quantum-noise ratio, commonly referred to as energy weighting, yielded only a minute improvement. In a simulation of a clinically more realistic case, spectral imaging was predicted to perform approximately 30% better than absorption imaging for an average glandularity breast with an average level of anatomical noise. For dense breast tissue and a high level of anatomical noise, however, a rise in detectability by a factor of 6 was predicted. Another ~70-90% improvement was found to be within reach for an optimized system. Conclusions: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography is feasible and beneficial with the current system, and there is room for additional improvements. Inclusion of anatomical noise is essential for optimizing spectral imaging systems.","Fredenberg, Erik; Hemmendorff, Magnus; Cederstrom, Bjorn; Aslund, Magnus; Danielsson, Mats",,305,28

Tobacco is one of the biggest public health threats and results in 8 million deaths every year through cardiovascular diseases, lung disorders, cancers, diabetes, and hypertension. There are several methods used in hospitals for inspecting their own health, however, they are difficult to use in daily life because all inspecting devices are large-scale and complex. Thus, the purpose of this study was to propose a new method to self-check the effect of smoking on capillaries and surface skin in daily life, then evaluate the usefulness of the proposed method. The dataset was collected from the 26 human subjects through the capillaroscopy;13 subjects were the smoker and the 13 were the non-smoker. Through all of the results for the recognition of the difference between smokers and non-smokers, it was confirmed that conventional methods to extract featured points from the edge or corner points such as ssim (structural similarity) and sift (scale-invariant feature transform) was not so good for the image processing of capillaries. However, it was found that CNN worked well with over 80% accuracy. It was discussed that efficientnet with the compound scaling was so good for the small dataset with the comparison of resnet50, vgg16, densenet121 with one scaling factor, although COVID-19 virus affected the dataset making procedure measured from human subjects directly.","Phuong, H.

Such instructional methods have gained increasing importance during the COVID-19 pandemic when physical classroom attendance was not possible. The study evaluated faculty's and students' perceptions concerning the online virtual classes and recorded lectures as compared to traditional classes delivered at the College of Dentistry, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences. Materials and Methods: Surveys were developed and distributed to 34 faculty members and 186 students. Perceptions about virtual classes, recorded lectures, physical attendance, the effectiveness of different teaching methods, and overall experience were evaluated. Descriptive statistics were presented using frequencies and percentages. The Chi-square test compared the students' and the faculty members' responses. The level of significance was set at a =0.05. Results: Thirty-one faculty members and 149 dental students participated, and the overall response rates were 91.2% and 80.1%, respectively. While there was a general agreement on the usefulness of making recorded lectures available, a statistically significant difference (p<0.001) was found between students' and faculty members' views on making classroom-lecture attendance optional (67.1% of students and 12.9% of the faculty agreed:strongly agreed). Statistically significant differences (p<0.001) were found between the students and faculty members concerning the effectiveness of recorded lectures and attending online virtual classes as an alternative to classroom attendance. Conclusion: Overall, students were more accepting of technology than faculty members as a substitute for traditional classroom teaching.

While recent DNA/RNA sequencing and other multi-omics technologies have advanced the understanding of the biology and pathophysiology of AD, no effective disease-modifying or preventive therapies, for AD have emerged in the past two decades. A new approach to integration of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and human interactome in the drug discovery and development process is essential for this endeavor. Methods In this study, we developed AlzGPS (Genome-wide Positioning Systems platform for Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Discovery, https://alzgps.lerner.ccf.org), a comprehensive systems biology tool to enable searching, visualizing, and analyzing multi-omics, various types of heterogeneous biological networks, and clinical databases for target identification and effective prevention and treatment of AD. Results Via AlzGPS: (1) we curated more than 100 AD multi-omics data sets capturing DNA, RNA, protein, and small molecules’ profiles underlying AD pathogenesis (e.g., early vs. late stage and tau vs. amyloid endophenotype); (2) we constructed endophenotype disease modules by incorporating multi-omics findings and human protein-protein interactome networks; (3) we identified repurposable drugs from ∼3,000 FDA approved/investigational drugs for AD using state-of-the-art network proximity analyses; (4) we curated 300 literature references for highly repurposable drugs; (5) we included information from over 200 ongoing AD clinicals noting drug mechanisms and primary drug targets, and linking them to our integrated multi-omics view for targets and network analyses results for the drugs; (6) we implemented a highly interactive web-interface for database browsing and network visualization. Conclusions Network visualization enabled by the AlzGPS includes brain-specific neighborhood networks for genes-of-interest, endophenotype disease module networks for data sets-of-interest, and mechanism-of-action networks for drugs targeting disease modules. By virtue of combining systems pharmacology and network-based integrative analysis of multi-omics data, the AlzGPS offers actionable systems biology tools for accelerating therapeutic development in AD.","Zhou, Yadi; Fang, Jiansong; Bekris, Lynn; Kim, Young Heon; Pieper, Andrew A.; Leverenz, James B.; Cummings, Jeffrey; Cheng, Feixiong",bioRxiv,305,5

Nevertheless, rule extraction from ensembles of Machine Learning models was rarely achieved. Moreover, experiments in this context have rarely been evaluated by cross-validation trials. Based on stratified tenfold cross-validation, we performed experiments with several ensemble models on Covid-19 prognostic data. Specifically, we compared the characteristics of the propositional rules generated from: Random Forests;Shallow Trees trained by Gradient Boosting;Decision Stumps trained by several variants of Boosting;and ensembles of transparent neural networks trained by Bagging. The Discretized Interpretable Multi Layer Perceptron (DIMLP) allowed us to generate rules from all the used ensembles by transforming Decision Trees into DIMLPs. Our rule extraction technique simply determines whether an axis-parallel hyperplane is discriminative or not, with a greedy algorithm that progressively removes rule antecedents. Rules extracted from Decision Stumps trained by modest Adaboost were the simplest with the highest fidelity. Our best average predictive accuracy result was equal to 96.5%. Finally, we described a particular ruleset extracted from an ensemble of Decision Stumps and it turned out that the rule antecedents seem to be plausible with respect to several recent works related to the Covid-19 virus. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Bologna, G.","5th IFIP TC 5, TC 12, WG 8.4, WG 8.9, WG 12.9 International Cross-Domain Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction, CD-MAKE 2021",305,31

In the alphaherpesvirus pseudorabies virus (PrV), the causative agent of Aujeszky's disease in pigs, the essential glycoprotein D (gD) mediates secondary attachment of virions to target cells by binding to newly identified cellular receptors (R. J. Geraghty, C. Krummenacher, G. H. Cohen, R. J. Eisenberg, and P. G. Spear, Science 280:1618-1620, 1998). However, in the presence of compensatory mutations, infection can also occur in the absence of gD, as evidenced by the isolation in cell culture of an infectious gD-negative PrV mutant (PrV-gD(-) Pass) (J. Schmidt, B. G. Klupp, A. Karger, and T. C. Mettenleiter, J. Virol. 71:17-24, 1997). PrV-gD(-) Pass is replication competent with an only moderate reduction in specific infectivity but appears to bind to receptors different from those recognized by wild-type PrV (A. Karger, J. Schmidt, and T. C. Mettenleiter, J. Virol. 72:7341-7348, 1998). To analyze whether this alteration in receptor usage in vitro influences infection in vivo, the model host mouse and the natural host pig were intranasally infected with PrV-gD(-) Pass and were compared to animals infected by wild-type PrV. For mice, a comparable progress of disease was observed, and all animals infected with mutant virus died, although they exhibited a slight delay in the onset of symptoms and, correspondingly, a longer time to death. In contrast, whereas wild-type PrV-infected pigs showed clinical signs and histological and histopathological findings typical of PrV infection, no signs of disease were observed after infection with PrV-gD(-) Pass. Moreover, in these animals, virus-infected cells were not detectable by immunohistochemical staining of different organ samples and no virus could be isolated from nasal swabs. Mutations in glycoproteins B and H were found to correlate with, and probably contribute to, gD-independent infectivity. In conclusion, although PrV-gD(-) Pass is virulent in mice, it is apparently unable to infect the natural host, the pig. This altered host range in vivo correlates with a difference of receptor usage in vitro and demonstrates for the first time the importance of gD receptors in alphaherpesvirus infection of an animal host.","Schmidt, J; Gerdts, V; Beyer, J; Klupp, B G; Mettenleiter, T C",Journal of virology,305,17

We develop here a model that quantitatively predicts the effect of RNA secondary structure on effective RNA-ligand binding activities based on equilibrium thermodynamics and the explicit computations of partition functions for the RNA structures. A statistical test for the impact of a particular structural feature on the binding affinities follows directly from this approach. The formalism is extended to describing the effects of hybridizing small ""modifier RNAs"" to a target RNA molecule outside its ligand binding site. We illustrate the applicability of our approach by quantitatively describing the interaction of the mRNA stabilizing protein HuR with AU-rich elements. We discuss our model and recent experimental findings demonstrating the effectivity of modifier RNAs in vitro in the context of the current research activities in the field of non-coding RNAs. We speculate that modifier RNAs might also exist in nature; if so, they present an additional regulatory layer for fine-tuning gene expression that could evolve rapidly, leaving no obvious traces in the genomic DNA sequences.","Hackermüller, Jörg; Meisner, Nicole-Claudia; Auer, Manfred; Jaritz, Markus; Stadler, Peter F",Gene,305,26

It was hypothesised that CCS would respond to the hypnotic component of anaesthesia and CI would differentiate between two groups of patients receiving different doses of fentanyl. Twenty-five patients scheduled to undergo elective first-time coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomised to receive a total fentanyl dose of either 12 μg/kg (fentanyl low dose, FLD) or 24 μg/kg (fentanyl moderate dose, FMD), both administered in two divided doses. Propofol was used for anaesthesia induction and pancuronium for intraoperative paralysis. Hemodynamic management was protocolised using vasoactive drugs. BIS, CCS and CI were simultaneously recorded. Response of the indices (CI, CCS and BIS) to propofol and their differences between the two groups at specific points from anaesthesia induction through to aortic cannulation were investigated. Following propofol induction, CCS and BIS but not CI showed a significant reduction. Following the first dose of fentanyl, CI, CCS and BIS decreased in both groups. Following the second dose of fentanyl, there was a significant reduction in CI in the FLD group but not the FMD group, with no significant change found for BIS or CCS in either group. The BAR monitor demonstrates the potential to monitor the level of hypnosis following anaesthesia induction with propofol via the CCS index and to facilitate the titration of fentanyl as a component of balanced anaesthesia via the CI index.","Shoushtarian, Mehrnaz; McGlade, Desmond P; Delacretaz, Louis J; Liley, David T J",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,305,11

The new guidelines are designed to reduce the incidence of pneumonia and other severe, acute lower respiratory tract infections in acute-care hospitals and in other health-care settings (e.g., ambulatory and long-term care institutions) and other facilities where health care is provided. Among the changes in the recommendations to prevent bacterial pneumonia, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia, are the preferential use of oro-tracheal rather than naso-tracheal tubes in patients who receive mechanically assisted ventilation, the use of noninvasive ventilation to reduce the need for and duration of endotracheal intubation, changing the breathing circuits of ventilators when they malfunction or are visibly contaminated, and (when feasible) the use of an endotracheal tube with a dorsal lumen to allow drainage of respiratory secretions; no recommendations were made about the use of sucralfate, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, or antacids for stress-bleeding prophylaxis. For prevention of health-care--associated Legionnaires disease, the changes include maintaining potable hot water at temperatures not suitable for amplification of Legionella spp., considering routine culturing of water samples from the potable water system of a facility's organ-transplant unit when it is done as part of the facility's comprehensive program to prevent and control health-care--associated Legionnaires disease, and initiating an investigation for the source of Legionella spp. when one definite or one possible case of laboratory-confirmed health-care--associated Legionnaires disease is identified in an inpatient hemopoietic stem-cell transplant (HSCT) recipient or in two or more HSCT recipients who had visited an outpatient HSCT unit during all or part of the 2-10 day period before illness onset. In the section on aspergillosis, the revised recommendations include the use of a room with high-efficiency particulate air filters rather than laminar airflow as the protective environment for allogeneic HSCT recipients and the use of high-efficiency respiratory-protection devices (e.g., N95 respirators) by severely immunocompromised patients when they leave their rooms when dust-generating activities are ongoing in the facility. In the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) section, the new recommendation is to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether to administer monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) to certain infants and children aged <24 months who were born prematurely and are at high risk for RSV infection. In the section on influenza, the new recommendations include the addition of oseltamivir (to amantadine and rimantadine) for prophylaxis of all patients without influenza illness and oseltamivir and zanamivir (to amantadine and rimantadine) as treatment for patients who are acutely ill with influenza in a unit where an influenza outbreak is recognized.

These cells mediate efficient infection of T cells by concentrating the delivery of virus through the infectious synapse, a process dependent on the cytoplasmic domain of DC-SIGN. Here, we identify a cellular protein that binds specifically to the cytoplasmic region of DC-SIGN and directs internalized virus to the proteasome. This cellular protein, leukocyte-specific protein 1 (LSP1), was defined biochemically by immunoprecipitation and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. LSP1 is an F-actin binding protein involved in leukocyte motility and found on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. LSP1 interacted specifically with DC-SIGN and other C-type lectins, but not the inactive mutant DC-SIGNDelta35, which lacks a cytoplasmic domain and shows altered virus transport in DCs. LSP1 diverts HIV-1 to the proteasome. Down-regulation of LSP1 with specific small interfering RNAs in human DCs enhanced HIV-1 transfer to T cells, and bone marrow DCs from lsp1(-/-) mice also showed an increase in transfer of HIV-1(BaL) to a human T cell line. Proteasome inhibitors increased retention of viral proteins in lsp1(+/+) DCs, and substantial colocalization of virus to the proteasome was observed in wild-type compared with LSP1-deficient cells. Collectively, these data suggest that LSP1 protein facilitates virus transport into the proteasome after its interaction with DC-SIGN through its interaction with cytoskeletal proteins.","Smith, Alvin L; Ganesh, Lakshmanan; Leung, Kwanyee; Jongstra-Bilen, Jenny; Jongstra, Jan; Nabel, Gary J",The Journal of experimental medicine,305,9

Prophylactic treatment of double-transgenic rats with a weight-adapted pediatric dosing regimen for either enfuvirtide (s.c., twice-daily) or efavirenz (oral, once-daily) achieved a 92.5% or 98.8% reduction, respectively, of the HIV-1 cDNA load in the spleen 4 days after i.v. HIV-1 challenge. Notably, a once-daily dosing regimen for enfuvirtide resulted in a approximately 5-fold weaker inhibition of infection, unmasking the unfavorable pharmacokinetic characteristics of the synthetic peptide in the context of an efficacy trial. This work provides proof of principle that HIV-susceptible transgenic rats can allow a rapid and predictive preclinical evaluation of the inhibitory potency and of the pharmacokinetic properties of antiviral compounds targeting early steps in the HIV replication cycle.","Goffinet, Christine; Allespach, Ina; Keppler, Oliver T",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,305,11

METHODS Altogether, 21 patients with mallet finger deformity (16 men, 5 women; average age 31 years, range 19-47 years) were treated with a modified palmaris longus tendon graft through a bone tunnel during 18 months (2014-2016). Four index fingers, seven middle fingers, eight ring fingers, and two little fingers were treated for four cutting injuries, eleven finger sprains, four crush injuries, and two twist injuries (7 open and 14 closed injuries). Duration from injury to surgery was 9 h to 13 weeks. Three patients underwent surgery after 6 weeks of unsuccessful conservative treatment. No tendon was attached to the extensor tendon insertion in 16 patients, and 5 had residual tendon of <0.2 cm attached. All patients had distal segment flexion deformity and dorsiflexion disorder. Surgery comprised transverse penetration and vertical drilling of the base of the distal phalanx (2.0 and 2.5 mm diameter drills). Equal shallow semitendinosus pieces of the palmaris longus tendon (4 cm) were obtained from the sagittal end and were passed through a dorsal bone hole, emerging from a transverse bone hole. The two bundles were sutured to the main tendon. Tension was adjusted, and the broken ends were sutured. The distal interphalangeal joints were fixed in hyperextension. RESULTS All patients were followed for 7-16 months (average 6.0 ± 0.3 months) postoperatively. All 21 patients had grade A wound healing, with no complications (e.g., necrotic wound, recurrence, joint stiffness). The mallet finger deformity was corrected with good appearance, no obvious abnormalities, and satisfactory flexion and extension. Two patients had a superficial wound infection. Each recovered after symptomatic treatment. One patient had a mild result, with limited extension. There were no recurrences. Results were evaluated according to Patel et al.'s system, which revealed 15 excellent and 5 good results (combined 95.23% rate), with 1 mild result (limited extension). Patients were satisfied with the appearance and function of the affected fingers, and the desired surgical end result was achieved. CONCLUSION Use of this modified surgery for treating mallet finger deformity, especially with no or little tendon attached at the extensor tendon insertion, results in nearly anatomical reconstruction of the extensor tendon insertion. Its advantages include simple surgery, reliable fixation, fewer complications, and clinical efficacy.","Liu, Zengbing; Ma, Kai; Huang, Dong",International journal of burns and trauma,305,16

Initially described with flu-like symptoms, variable cutaneous manifestations have been reported, with only few histopathological descriptions. Detection of the virus in cutaneous samples has been assessed in very few cases until now, and the causative role of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not been proven for every type of cutaneous manifestations yet. We aimed to describe histological features of cutaneous eruptions occurring concomitantly to SARS-CoV-2 infection and assess by immunochemistry and in situ hybridization using RNAscope validation techniques the presence of the virus in skin lesions. We retrieved all skin biopsies received in the departments of pathology and dermatopathology, University Hospital of Strasbourg, performed in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients presenting concomitant cutaneous manifestations since March 2020. In situ hybridization and immunostaining using a polyclonal SARS nucleocapsid protein antibody were performed on each sample. Skin biopsies from six patients presenting morbilliform eruption concomitant to SARS-CoV-2 infection were available for evaluation. All six samples showed varying degrees of spongiosis, perivascular inflammatory infiltrates of the dermis, and, for some of them, discrete interface dermatitis. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were negative in all cutaneous samples. Morbilliform rash concomitant to SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by mild and unspecific histopathological features with no detectable viral RNA and protein and appears then not to be directly caused by the virus. Even if, at least for a few cases, the differential diagnosis with drug hypersensitivity reaction can be difficult, these cutaneous eruptions seem to rather correspond to paraviral rashes.","Fattori, Antonin; Cribier, Bernard; Chenard, Marie-Pierre; Mitcov, Mona; Mayeur, Sylvain; Weingertner, Noëlle",Hum Pathol,305,5

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 336 COVID-19 inpatients between February 15, 2020 and April 30, 2020 at the Taikang Tongji Hospital (Wuhan), China. Electronic medical records including patient demographics, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography (CT) images were reviewed. RESULTS: In total, 300 patients with complete clinical outcomes were included for analysis. The mean age was 65.3 years, and most patients were women (n = 167, 55.7%). Over 50% of patients presented with comorbidities, with hypertension (63.5%) being the most common comorbidity. After propensity score matching, results showed that men had significantly higher odds than premenopausal women for developing severe disease type (23.7% vs. 0%, OR 17.12, 95% CI 1.00-293.60; p = 0.003) and bilateral lung infiltration (86.1% vs. 64.7%, OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.08-10.64; p = 0.04), but not for mortality (2.0% vs. 0%, OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.04-19.12, p = 1.00). However, non-significant difference was observed among men and postmenopausal women in the percentage of severe disease type (32.7% vs. 41.7%, OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.37-1.24, p = 0.21), bilateral lung infiltration (86.1% vs. 91.7%, OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.22-1.47, p = 0.24), and mortality (2.0% vs. 6.0%, OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.06-1.69, p = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS: Men had higher disease severity than premenopausal women, while the differences disappeared between postmenopausal women and men. These findings support aggressive treatment for the poor prognosis of postmenopausal women in clinical practice.","Wang, Xing-Wang; Hu, Hao; Xu, Zhi-Yong; Zhang, Gong-Kai; Yu, Qing-Hua; Yang, Hui-Lan; Zheng, Ji-Hua",Biol Sex Differ,305,3

Immune dysregulation is linked to uncontrolled proinflammatory response characterized by the release of cytokines (cytokines storm). A proper control of this response is mandatory to improve clinical prognosis. In this context, glucocorticoids are able to change the expression of several genes involved in the inflammatory response leading to an improvement in acute respiratory distress. Although there are contradictory data in the literature, in this report we highlight the potential benefits of glucocorticoids as adjuvant therapy for hyperinflammation control; emphasizing that adequate dosage, timing, and delivery are crucial to reduce the dysregulated peripheral-and neuro-inflammatory response with minimal adverse effects. We propose the use of the intranasal route for glucocorticoid administration, which has been shown to effectively control the neuro-and peripheral-inflammatory response using low doses without generating unwanted side effects.","Cárdenas, Graciela; Torres-García, Diana; Cervantes-Torres, Jacquelynne; Rosales-Mendoza, Sergio; Fleury, Agnes; Fragoso, Gladis; Laclette, Juan Pedro; Sciutto, Edda",Arch. med. res,305,7

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from psychiatric professionals in 34 hospitals between 29 January and 7 February 2020, in China. Hospitals equipped with fever clinics or deployed on wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. PRIMARY OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and distress were assessed by the Chinese versions of 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder, 7-item Insomnia Severity Index and 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression and structural equation modelling was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 610 psychiatric professionals were included. 29.8% were employed in Wuhan, and 22.5% were frontline workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (461 (75.6%)), anxiety (282 (46.2%)), insomnia (336 (55.1%)) and mental stress (481 (78.9%)). Psychiatric symptoms were associated with worrying about infection (eg, OR 2.36 (95% CI 1.27 to 4.39) for anxiety), risks of exposure to COVID-19 (eg, having inadequate personal protection equipment, OR 2.43 (1.32 to 4.47) for depression) and self-perceived physical health (eg, OR 3.22 (2.24 to 4.64) for mental stress). Information sources of COVID-19 were also found to be both positively (eg, information from relatives, OR 2.16 (1.46 to 3.21) for mental stress) and negatively (eg, information from TV, OR 0.52 (0.35 to 0.77) for mental stress) associated with mental stress. There is preliminary evidence that mental health might benefit from greater availability of mental healthcare services. The structural equation model analysis indicated that worrying about infection may be the primary mediator via which risk of exposure to COVID-19 pandemic affects the mental health of psychiatric professionals. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings demonstrate several pathways via which the COVID-19 pandemic may have negatively affected the mental health of psychiatric professionals in China.","Guo, Xin; McCutcheon, Robert; Pillinger, Toby; Arumuham, Atheeshaan; Chen, Jianhua; Ma, Simeng; Yang, Jun; Wang, Ying; Hu, Shaohua; Wang, Gaohua; Liu, Zhong-Chun",BMJ Open,305,32

The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 highlights an urgent need to develop effective therapeutics for blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread. Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) is a chief element in host antiviral defense pathways. In this study, we examined the impact of the STING signaling pathway on coronavirus infection using the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) model. We found that HCoV-OC43 infection did not stimulate the STING signaling pathway, but the activation of STING signaling effectively inhibits HCoV-OC43 infection to a much greater extent than that of type I interferons (IFNs). We also discovered that IRF3, the key STING downstream innate immune effector, is essential for this anticoronavirus activity. In addition, we found that the amidobenzimidazole (ABZI)-based human STING agonist diABZI robustly blocks the infection of not only HCoV-OC43 but also SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, our study identifies the STING signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target that could be exploited for developing broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics against multiple coronavirus strains in order to face the challenge of future coronavirus outbreaks.IMPORTANCE The highly infectious and lethal SARS-CoV-2 is posing an unprecedented threat to public health. Other coronaviruses are likely to jump from a nonhuman animal to humans in the future. Novel broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics are therefore needed to control known pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and its newly mutated variants, as well as future coronavirus outbreaks. STING signaling is a well-established host defense pathway, but its role in coronavirus infection remains unclear. In the present study, we found that activation of the STING signaling pathway robustly inhibits infection of HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2. These results identified the STING pathway as a novel target for controlling the spread of known pathogenic coronaviruses, as well as emerging coronavirus outbreaks.","Liu, Wei; Reyes, Hanako M; Yang, June F; Li, Yize; Stewart, Kathleen M; Basil, Maria C; Lin, Susan M; Katzen, Jeremy; Morrisey, Edward E; Weiss, Susan R; You, Jianxin",J. virol,305,29

The challenging problem of estimating the BTD model structure, namely the number of block terms (rank) and their individual (block) ranks, is of crucial importance in practice and has only recently started to attract significant attention. In data-streaming scenarios and/or big data applications, where the tensor dimension in one of its modes grows in time or can only be processed incrementally, it is essential to be able to perform model selection and computation in a recursive (incremental/online) manner. To date there is only one such work in the literature concerning the (general rank-$(L,M,N)$) BTD model, which proposes an incremental method, however with the BTD rank and block ranks assumed to be a-priori known and time invariant. In this preprint, a novel approach to rank-$(L_r,L_r,1)$ BTD model selection and tracking is proposed, based on the idea of imposing column sparsity jointly on the factors and estimating the ranks as the numbers of factor columns of nonnegligible magnitude. An online method of the alternating iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) type is developed and shown to be computationally efficient and fast converging, also allowing the model ranks to change in time. Its time and memory efficiency are evaluated and favorably compared with those of the batch approach. Simulation results are reported that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in both selecting and tracking the correct BTD model.","Rontogiannis, Athanasios A.; Kofidis, Eleftherios; Giampouras, Paris V.",,305,24

Biomedical informatics relies for the most part on structured data, which require a preexisting data or knowledge model; however, novel diseases do not have preexisting knowledge models. In an emergent epidemic, language processing can enable rapid conversion of unstructured text to a novel knowledge model. However, although this idea has often been suggested, no opportunity has arisen to actually test it in real time. The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents such an opportunity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the added value of information from clinical text in response to emergent diseases using natural language processing (NLP). METHODS: We explored the effects of long-term treatment by calcium channel blockers on the outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients with high blood pressure during in-patient hospital stays using two sources of information: data available strictly from structured electronic health records (EHRs) and data available through structured EHRs and text mining. RESULTS: In this multicenter study involving 39 hospitals, text mining increased the statistical power sufficiently to change a negative result for an adjusted hazard ratio to a positive one. Compared to the baseline structured data, the number of patients available for inclusion in the study increased by 2.95 times, the amount of available information on medications increased by 7.2 times, and the amount of additional phenotypic information increased by 11.9 times. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, use of calcium channel blockers was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. This finding was obtained by quickly adapting an NLP pipeline to the domain of the novel disease; the adapted pipeline still performed sufficiently to extract useful information. When that information was used to supplement existing structured data, the sample size could be increased sufficiently to see treatment effects that were not previously statistically detectable.","Neuraz, Antoine; Lerner, Ivan; Digan, William; Paris, Nicolas; Tsopra, Rosy; Rogier, Alice; Baudoin, David; Cohen, Kevin Bretonnel; Burgun, Anita; Garcelon, Nicolas; Rance, Bastien",J Med Internet Res,305,29

However, water pollution is currently among the major environmental challenges and has attracted increasing study attention. How to handle contaminated water now mainly focuses on removing or reducing the pollutants from the wastewater. Cyclodextrin derivatives, possessing external hydrophilic and internal hydrophobic properties, have been recognized as new-generation adsorbents to exert positive effects on water pollution treatment. This article outlines recent contributions of cyclodextrin-based adsorbents on wastewater treatment, highlighting different adsorption mechanisms of cyclodextrin-based adsorbents under different influencing factors. The crosslinked and immobilized cyclodextrin-based adsorbents all displayed outstanding adsorption capacities. Particularly, according to specific pollutants including metal ions, organic chemicals, pesticides, and drugs in wastewater, this article has classified and organized various cyclodextrin-based adsorbents into tables, which could pave an intuitive shortcut for designing and developing efficient cyclodextrin-based adsorbents for targeted wastewater pollutants. Besides, this article specially discusses cost-effectiveness and regeneration performance of current cyclodextrin-based adsorbents. Finally, the challenges and future directions of cyclodextrin-based adsorbents are prospected in this article, which may shed substantial light on practical industrial applications of cyclodextrin-based adsorbents.","Tian, Bingren; Hua, Shiyao; Tian, Yu; Liu, Jiayue",,305,27

Methods: All healthcare providers currently working in different hospitals were invited to participate in this study. Data gathering started in March 2020 to May 2020. The participants answered a five-part questionnaire which includes demographic data, a 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, a 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder, a 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and a 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, which assess the level of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. Results: Out of 200 healthcare providers, 40% were males. 52% were aged 31-40 years old, 61% were married. The majority of the participants were Saudi nationals (84%), 74% were nurses, 11% were physicians and 15% were other healthcare providers. More than half of the participants worked as front-liners (57%). Overall, 73, 69, 62, and 83% of all healthcare providers reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, respectively.

Within the framework of this concept, a persistent increase in resistance to various pathogens, which occurs after an infectious disease or exposure to certain microbial agents, is associated with epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells and their bone marrow progenitors. The COVID-19 pandemic has drawn attention of scientists and practitioners to BCG as an inducer of trained immunity. A number of epidemiological studies have suggested a negative association between the coverage of the population with BCG vaccination and the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A series of independent clinical studies of the effectiveness of this vaccine in non-specific prevention of COVID-19 has been initiated in different countries. Recently, the key role of cytosolic NOD2 receptors in BCG-induced trained immunity has been proven. This actualizes the search for effective immunoactive preparations for prevention of respiratory infections in the pandemic among low molecular weight peptidoglycan fragments of the bacterial cell wall, muramylpeptides (MPs), which are known to be NOD2 agonists. The review highlights the proven and proposed linkages between BCG, MPs, NOD2 and trained immunity in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of the data presented indicates the prospects for preclinical and clinical studies of MPs as potential drugs for nonspecific prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or other respiratory infections in risk groups during the pandemic. First of all, attention should be paid to glucosaminylmuramyl dipeptide, approved for clinical use in Russia and a number of post-Soviet countries for the complex treatment and prevention of acute and recurrent respiratory infections.","Kalyuzhin, O V; Andronova, T M; Karaulov, A V",Ter Arkh,305,5

The chemosensory deficits are often the earliest, and sometimes the only signs in otherwise asymptomatic carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The reasons for the surprisingly early and specific chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19 are now beginning to be elucidated. In this hypothesis review, we discuss implications of the recent finding that the prevalence of smell and taste dysfunction in COVID-19 patients differs between populations, possibly because of differences in the spike protein of different virus strains or because of differences in the host proteins that enable virus entry, thus modifying infectivity. We review recent progress in defining underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of the virus-induced anosmia, with a focus on the emerging crucial role of sustentacular cells in the olfactory epithelium. We critically examine the current evidence whether and how the SARS-CoV-2 virus can follow a route from the olfactory epithelium in the nose to the brain to achieve brain infection, and we discuss the prospects for using the smell and taste dysfunctions seen in COVID-19 as an early and rapid diagnostic screening tool.","Butowt, Rafal; von Bartheld, Christopher S",Neuroscientist,305,30

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphism is one of the genetic factors that might have an impact on the outcome of the disease. This study explored the association between the HLA genotype and the severity of COVID-19 among patients from South Asia. Blood samples from 95 Asians (Bangladeshis, Indians, and Pakistanis) with COVID-19 were collected. The patients were divided according to the severity of their infection: mild (N = 64), severe (N = 31), and fatal (N = 20). DNA was extracted from all samples, and HLA genotyping was performed for both class I (A, B, and C) and class II (DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1) using the PCR-rSSO (polymerase chain reaction-reverse sequence-specific oligonucleotide) molecular method. The frequency of HLA-B*51 was significantly higher among patients in the fatal group than among those in the mild infection group (15% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.027). Additionally, the frequency of HLA-B*35 was significantly higher in the mild infection group than in the fatal group (21.1% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.050 [a borderline p-value]). In terms of HLA class II, DRB1*13 was significantly observed in the fatal group than in the mild infection group (17.5% vs. 11.3%, p = 0.049). However, the p-value for all alleles became insignificant after a statistical correction for the p-values (pc = 0.216, pc = 0.4, and pc = 0.49, respectively). Compared with all published data, this study highlights that the association between the HLA system and the COVID-19 outcome might be ethnic-dependent.

The present study examines how signal degradation and loss of visual information due to masks affects intelligibility and memory for native and non-native speech. We also test whether clear speech can alleviate perceptual difficulty for masked speech. One native and one non-native speaker of English recorded video clips in conversational speech without a mask and conversational and clear speech with a mask. Native English listeners watched video clips presented in quiet or mixed with competing speech. The results showed that word recognition and recall of speech produced with a mask can be as accurate as without a mask in optimal listening conditions. Masks affected non-native speech processing at easier noise levels than native speech. Clear speech with a mask significantly improved accuracy in all listening conditions. Speaking clearly, reducing noise, and using surgical masks as well as good signal amplification can help compensate for the loss of intelligibility due to background noise, lack of visual cues, physical distancing, or non-native speech. The findings have implications for communication in classrooms and hospitals where listeners interact with teachers and healthcare providers, oftentimes non-native speakers, through their protective barriers.","Smiljanic, Rajka; Keerstock, Sandie; Meemann, Kirsten; Ransom, Sarah M",J Acoust Soc Am,305,16

It is a prominently respiratory infection, with potential cardiological, hematological, gastrointestinal and renal complications. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is found in 0.5-25% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and constitutes a negative prognostic factor. Renal damage mechanisms are not completely clear. We report the clinical evolution of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who presented with AKI requiring attention from the Nephrology team in a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. METHODS: This is an observational prospective study including all COVID-19 cases that required hospitalization and Nephrology management from March 6th to May 12th 2020. We collected clinical and analytical data of baseline characteristics, COVID-19 and AKI evolutions. RESULTS: We analyzed 41 patients with a mean age of 66.8 years (SD 2.1), 90.2% males, and with a history of chronic kidney disease in 36.6%. A percentage of 56.1 presented with severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 31.7% required intensive care. AKI etiology was prerenal in 61%, acute tubular necrosis in the context of sepsis in 24.4%, glomerular in 7.3% and tubular toxicity in 7.3% of the cases. We reported proteinuria in 88.9% and hematuria in 79.4% of patients. A percentage of 48.8 required renal replacement therapy. Median length of stay was 12 days (IQR 9-23) and 22% of the population died. Patients who developed AKI during hospital stay presented with higher C-reactive protein, LDH and D-dimer values, more severe pulmonary damage, more frequent ICU admission, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and biological drugs and renal replacement therapy requirement. CONCLUSIONS: Hypovolemia and dehydration are a frequent cause of AKI among COVID-19 patients. Those who develop AKI during hospitalization display worse prognostic factors in terms of pulmonary damage, renal damage, and analytical findings. We believe that monitorization of renal markers, as well as individualized fluid management, can play a key role in AKI prevention.","Tarragón, Blanca; Valdenebro, María; Serrano, Maria Luisa; Maroto, Alba; Llópez-Carratalá, M Rosario; Ramos, Antonio; Rubio, Esther; Huerta, Ana; Marques, María; Portolés, Jose",Nefrologia (Madrid),305,24

For each configuration, we also study their monomeric and homodimeric forms. The simulations of the unbound systems show that the relative orientation of domain III is not stable in the monomeric form and provide further details about interdomain motions, protomer-protomer interactions, inter-residue contacts, accessibility at the catalytic site, etc. In the presence of the peptide substrate, the monomeric protease exhibits a stable interdomain arrangement, but the relative orientation between the scissile peptide bond and the catalytic dyad is not favorable for catalysis. By means of comparative analysis, we further assess the catalytic impact of the enzyme dimerization, the actual flexibility of the active site region, and other structural effects induced by substrate binding. Overall, our computational results complement previous crystallographic studies on the SARS-CoV-2 enzyme and, together with other simulation studies, should contribute to outline useful structure-activity relationships.","Suárez, Dimas; Díaz, Natalia",J. chem. inf. model,305,5

Worldwide demand for personal protective equipment has risen, with diminishing supplies and shortages reported. During the pandemic, charitable donations have been made by the public, aimed at helping medical staff. Based on the open data, we investigate the charitable in-kind donations received by a large medical center in northern Taiwan (Taipei Veterans General Hospital [TPEVGH]) in Taiwan during the pandemic. METHODS: The period of investigation was the first half of the year 2020. TPEVGH has received various public donations. The list of donations published on the hospital's official website was analyzed. The variables in the analysis were donation category, donation percentage, number of donations, and total donation amount. RESULTS: Most in-kind donations were food and beverages (55.1%), with a monetary value of 3 124 510 New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) (24.3%). Medical equipment accounted for the second-highest number of items (34.8%) but was the highest monetary value (70.6%; 9 275 945 of 12 875 855 NTD). Daily necessities accounted for the lowest number of items (10.1%) and had a total monetary value of 475 400 NTD (3.7%). Over two-thirds were beverages (68.4%), all of which were bottles or cans for easy storage. Despite only five items (13.2%) being juice, the donation size was the largest, accounting for nearly half (47.1%) of the total monetary value. Only one item was fruit, which was high-class organic apples. The monetary value of this item was the highest (7.8%) among all donated food. Most donated snacks were biscuits. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, most public donations to TPEVGH were food and daily necessities. While every donation should be appreciated, accepting high volumes of donations might incur donation management problems. Further research could be focused on managerial aspects, for example, quality and safety checking, storage, and distribution.","Lin, Ching-Wei; Hsu, Ya-Chuan; Wu, Chien-Cheng; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Hwang, Shinn-Jang",J Chin Med Assoc,305,28

Attention is given to his understanding of the eternal covenant God has made with humanity and how we are cared for within a covenantal fellowship. The study also concerns itself with how Barth's distaste for the notion of analogia entis is somewhat unsustained in his treatment of creation. I argue that, to some extent, the analogy of being vis-à-vis the cosmos is complementarily employed with analogia fides in Barth's articulation of creation care. This is the case as he reconfigures the talk on creation rigidly in and through Jesus Christ as Creator and creature.

Although IRTs have significant potential for human body temperature measurement, the literature indicates inconsistent diagnostic performance, possibly due to wide variations in implemented methodology. A standardized method for IRT fever screening was recently published, but there is a lack of clinical data demonstrating its impact on IRT performance. AIM: Perform a clinical study to assess the diagnostic effectiveness of standardized IRT-based fever screening and evaluate the effect of facial measurement location. APPROACH: We performed a clinical study of 596 subjects. Temperatures from 17 facial locations were extracted from thermal images and compared with oral thermometry. Statistical analyses included calculation of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) values for detection of febrile subjects. RESULTS: Pearson correlation coefficients for IRT-based and reference (oral) temperatures were found to vary strongly with measurement location. Approaches based on maximum temperatures in either inner canthi or full-face regions indicated stronger discrimination ability than maximum forehead temperature (AUC values of 0.95 to 0.97 versus 0.86 to 0.87, respectively) and other specific facial locations. These values are markedly better than the vast majority of results found in prior human studies of IRT-based fever screening. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide clinical confirmation of the utility of consensus approaches for fever screening, including the use of inner canthi temperatures, while also indicating that full-face maximum temperatures may provide an effective alternate approach.","Zhou, Yangling; Ghassemi, Pejman; Chen, Michelle; McBride, David; Casamento, Jon P; Pfefer, T Joshua; Wang, Quanzeng",,305,5

The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical and laboratory characteristics and outcomes of 24 COVID-19 pregnant patients and their newborns referred to the Al-Zahra tertiary maternity hospital in Tabriz, Iran. METHODS: Clinical records of 24 COVID-19 confirmed pregnant patients were retrospectively reviewed from10 March 2020 to 15 April 2020. Vertical transition was assessed through neonatal pharyngeal swab samples. The study has been approved by the Tabriz University Medical Ethics Committee (IR.TBZMED.REC.1399.497). RESULTS: There were 24 hospitalized cases with clinical symptoms and confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The mean age of cases was 26.5 years; most were nulliparous (54.2%), in their third trimester (62.5%) and were in the type A blood group. Clinical symptoms in order of prevalence were cough, fever, dyspnea, myalgia, anosmia, and diarrhea. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) in 70.8% cases was in the normal range (greater than 93%). The risk of premature labor or abortion in cases showed no increase. 12 cases were in ongoing normal status; on follow up, 11 cases had delivered their babies at term and one had ended in IUFD because of pregnancy-induced hypertension. All delivered babies were healthy. Caesarean section in all cases was performed under obstetric indications or maternal demand, and no relation was found between COVID-19 and Caesarean delivery. Neonatal outcomes according to gestational age in 8 cases out of 11 (72.72%) were desirable; neonatal morbidity and mortality resulted from pregnancy complications. Blood pH in 6 neonates was assessed due to immaturity and NICU admission, all of which were in normal ranges except one case related to HELLP syndrome. There was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that clinical symptoms in pregnancy were similar to non-pregnant women, no rise in risk of premature labor or abortion was seen, and vertical transmission was not observed in none of cases. Lymphopenia was the leading laboratory change. Given asymptomatic cases despite severe forms of infection in pregnancies, we propose screening in all suspected cases.

Second, it is shown that the restrictions imposed on a SVAR can be validated by testing independence of the identified shocks. The test can be applied whether the data have fat or thin tails, and to over as well as exactly identified models. Third, the disaster shock is identified as the component with the largest kurtosis, where the mutually independent components are estimated using an estimator that is valid even in the presence of an infinite variance shock.

This study indicated that IVM inhibits the replication of BCoV, BVDV, BRSV, BPIV-3 and BoHV-1 in a dose-dependent manner in vitro as well as number of extracellular infectious virions. In addition, it was demonstrated that IVM has no clear effect on the attachment and penetration steps of the replication of the studied viruses. Finally, this study shows for the first time that IVM can inhibit infection of BRD-related viral agents namely BCoV, BPIV-3, BVDV, BRSV and BoHV-1 at the concentrations of 2.5 and 5 µM. Consequently, IVM, which is licensed for antiparasitic indications, also deserves to be evaluated as a broad-spectrum antiviral in BRD cases caused by viral pathogens.","Yesilbag, Kadir; Toker, Eda Baldan; Ates, Ozer",Virus Res,305,24

In this report, we analyzed the structural characteristics of the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit (S1-NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in comparison to the SARS-CoV in particular, and to other viruses presenting similar characteristic in general. Given the severity and the wide and rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is very likely that the virus recognizes other receptors/co-receptors besides the ACE2. The NTD of the SARS-CoV-2 contains a receptor-binding motif different from that of SARS-CoV, with some insertions that could confer to the new coronavirus new receptor binding abilities. In particular, motifs similar to the insertion 72GTNGTKR78 have been found in structural proteins of other viruses; and these motifs were located in putative regions involved in recognizing protein and sugar receptors, suggesting therefore that similar binding abilities could be displayed by the SARS-CoV-2 S1-NTD. Moreover, concerning the origin of these NTD insertions, our findings point towards an evolutionary acquisition rather than the hypothesis of an engineered virus.","Behloul, Nouredine; Baha, Sarra; Shi, Ruihua; Meng, Jihong",Virus Res,305,16

As convalescent plasma is already used as antibody therapy, this study aimed to compare the binding capacity of antibodies specific to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 between human milk and serum from COVID-19-recovered women. Materials and Methods: The areas under the curve (AUCs) for IgA, IgM, and IgG specific to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in human milk and serum samples were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Milk samples were collected from 12 COVID-19-recovered women, while serum samples were from 10 COVID-19-recovered women. The antibody concentrations were also determined. Results: Our study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibody titers differed between human milk and serum samples from COVID-19-recovered women. When the AUCs were not divided by the antibody concentration, SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA, IgM, and IgG levels were higher in the serum sample group than the human milk group (p < 0.001). However, the titers of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgM (AUC/µg of IgM) and IgG (AUC/µg of IgG) were higher in human milk samples than serum samples (p < 0.05). The titer of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA (AUC/mg of IgA) was higher in the serum sample group than the human milk group (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Human milk antibodies specific to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 must be purified to obtain comparable binding capacity observed with SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific serum antibodies.","Demers-Mathieu, Veronique; DaPra, Ciera; Medo, Elena",Breastfeed Med,305,1

Hyperactivation of this protein by human coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to contribute to aberrant complement activation in patients, leading to aggravated lung injury with potentially fatal consequences. This hyperactivation is triggered in the lungs through a conserved, direct interaction between MASP-2 and coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Blocking this interaction with monoclonal antibodies and interfering directly with the catalytic activity of MASP-2, have been found to alleviate coronavirus-induced lung injury both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, a virtual library of 8736 licensed drugs and clinical agents has been screened in silico according to two parallel strategies. The first strategy aims at identifying direct inhibitors of MASP-2 catalytic activity, while the second strategy focusses on finding protein-protein interaction inhibitors (PPIs) of MASP-2 and coronaviral N proteins. Such agents could represent promising support treatment options to prevent lung injury and reduce mortality rates of infections caused by both present and future-emerging coronaviruses. Forty-six drug repurposing candidates were purchased and, for the ones selected as potential direct inhibitors of MASP-2, a preliminary in vitro assay was conducted to assess their interference with the lectin pathway of complement activation. Some of the tested agents displayed a dose-response inhibitory activity of the lectin pathway, potentially providing the basis for a viable support strategy to prevent the severe complications of coronavirus infections.","Flude, Ben M; Nannetti, Giulio; Mitchell, Paige; Compton, Nina; Richards, Chloe; Heurich, Meike; Brancale, Andrea; Ferla, Salvatore; Bassetto, Marcella",Viruses,305,2

Given that 41% of all young persons are enrolled in universities, and the increased vulnerabilities faced by SGM young persons during the pandemic, it is imperative to understand the effects of alcohol use on mental health among SGM university students amid COVID-19. This study aims to examine the associations between changes in alcohol use since the start of COVID-19 and mental distress among SGM university students in the U.S., and to explore sex-stratified differences. METHODS: A nonprobability cross-sectional sample of 509 SGM university students (Mage = 22.04 years, SD = 3.99) were retrospectively surveyed online between May-August 2020 and asked if their alcohol use had changed since the start of COVID-19. Statistical analyses explored the association between changes in alcohol use since the start of COVID-19 and mental distress. RESULTS: Average psychological distress (M = 27.79, SD = 7.82) was relatively high as per existing research and established clinical cutoff scores. Roughly 32% had increased alcohol use since the start of COVID-19. Subsequently, greater alcohol use (p < .05) since the start of COVID-19 was associated with higher psychological distress among SGM university students, and among females but not males assigned at birth. CONCLUSIONS: Higher education, medical, and behavioral health professionals should consider how to adapt their practice to address alcohol use and psychological burdens among SGM university students (especially females) who are facing health inequities during and beyond COVID-19, requiring SGM-affirmative care.","Salerno, John P; Shrader, Cho-Hee; Algarin, Angel B; Lee, Ji-Young; Fish, Jessica N",Drug Alcohol Depend,305,1

COVID-19 containment measures, including isolation and triage, led to restrictions in the health care of chronically ill patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health care of IBD patients. METHODS: In this multicentre cross-sectional study to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on the mental health and quality of care of patients with inherited bleeding disorder, an ad hoc questionnaire was sent to 586 patients/parents of children with haemophilia A, B or von Willebrand syndrome type 3. In addition to demographic and clinical data, patients/parents of patients with inherited bleeding disorders were asked about their thoughts, concerns and experiences regarding their medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Differences between clinical subgroups were calculated. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between subgroups (severity, type of therapy, product class, comorbidities) with regard to the transmission of COVID-19 through plasma products, the effects of COVID-19 positive test results, fear of getting COVID-19, delayed drug supply and physiotherapy treatment. DISCUSSION: The medical care of patients with inherited bleeding disorders, who need a continuous supply of essential drugs, is a particular challenge in times of pandemics. Therefore, worries and fears of IBD patients should be taken seriously and innovative communication channels established to maintain therapy standards and quality of care.","Olivieri, Martin; Halimeh, Susan; Wermes, Cornelia; Hassenpflug, Wolf; Holstein, Katharina; von Mackensen, Sylvia",Gesundheitswesen,305,21

However, the climate of the pandemic has also seen anti-vaccination sentiments flourish. AIMS: To determine the intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers at a London Hospital Trust and examine variation in uptake between demographic groups. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey open to staff working at the trust. Staff rated on a five-point scale the likelihood of them accepting COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: We received 514 responses, representing 16% of the workforce. About 59% of staff intended to seek vaccination, 24% to reject and 17% were unsure. There was significantly reduced intended uptake in females, younger age groups, healthcare assistants, nurses, staff of black ethnic backgrounds and those who rejected influenza vaccination. Safety was the dominant concern. CONCLUSIONS: Our study finds COVID-19 vaccinate hesitancy is prevalent among healthcare workers at a London Hospital Trust. It is particularly concerning that hesitancy was highest amongst groups most exposed to COVID-19 and most at risk of severe disease. Reasons behind disparities in uptake must be addressed to protect staff and prevent deepening inequalities within the healthcare workforce.","Abuown, A; Ellis, T; Miller, J; Davidson, R; Kachwala, Q; Medeiros, M; Mejia, K; Manoraj, S; Sidhu, M; Whittington, A M; Pattani, S",Occup. med,305,1

To that end, the different transmission routes, and their role in determining the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic are analyzed in this work. Probability of infection caused by inhaling virus-laden droplets (initial, ejection diameters between $0.5-750\mu m$) and the corresponding desiccated nuclei that mostly encapsulate the virions post droplet evaporation, are individually calculated. At typical, air-conditioned yet quiescent indoor space, for average viral loading, cough droplets of initial diameter between $10-50 \mu m$ have the highest infection probability. However, by the time they are inhaled, the diameters reduce to about $1/6^{th}$ of their initial diameters. While the initially near unity infection probability due to droplets rapidly decays within the first $25s$, the small yet persistent infection probability of desiccated nuclei decays appreciably only by $\mathcal{O} (1000s)$, assuming the virus sustains equally well within the dried droplet nuclei as in the droplets. Combined with molecular collision theory adapted to calculate frequency of contact between the susceptible population and the droplet/nuclei cloud, infection rate constants are derived ab-initio, leading to a SEIR model applicable for any respiratory event - vector combination. Viral load, minimum infectious dose, sensitivity of the virus half-life to the phase of its vector and dilution of the respiratory jet/puff by the entraining air are shown to mechanistically determine specific physical modes of transmission and variation in the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$, from first principle calculations.","Chaudhuri, Swetaprovo; Basu, Saptarshi; Saha, Abhishek",,305,24

METHODS: COVID-19 patients were included. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was tested in stool and respiratory specimens until two sequential negative results were obtained. Clinical, laboratory and imaging data were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 69 COVID-19 patients, 20 (28.99 %) had positive fecal viral tests who were younger, had lower C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen (FIB) levels on admission (all P < 0.05), and showed more improvement and less progression on chest CT during recovery. The median duration of positive viral signals was significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory samples (P < 0.05). In spite of the negative oropharyngeal swabs, eleven patients were tested positive for viral RNA in stool specimens, with their fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA Ct (cycle threshold) values reaching 25-27. 6 of these 11 patients' Ct values rebounded. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens was associated with a milder condition and better recovery of chest CT results while the median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA persistence was significantly longer in fecal samples than in oropharyngeal swabs. The fecal viral load easily reached a high level and rebounded even though respiratory signals became negative.","Wang, Xiaoming; Zheng, Jingwei; Guo, Lei; Yao, Hao; Wang, Lingya; Xia, XiaoDong; Zhang, Weixi",Virus Res,305,16

Working in the frontline with suspected Covid-19 infection patients, general practitioners (GPs) are daily under both physical and psychological pressure. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was carried out on italian GPs working in Genoa (Italy), to assess the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on mental health. The survey was anonymous and a free Google Forms® software was used. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one GPs completed the survey. Compared to GPs with absent or mild depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 < 10), GPs reporting moderate to severe depressive symptoms (N=30, 22.9%; PHQ-9 &#8805; 10) reported more helplessness (96.7% vs. 79.2%, p=.025), spent more than three hours searching for COVID-19 information (43.3% vs. 19.8%, p=.024), perceived less adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) (6.7% vs. 23.8%, p=.049) and visited more COVID-19 infected patients (16.63 ± 27.30 vs. 9.52 ± 11.75, p=.041). Moreover, PHQ-9 &#8805; 10 GPs reported a significant higher severity for both anxiety and insomnia (13.43 ± 4.96 vs. 4.88 ± 3.53 and 11.60 ± 5.53 vs. 4.84 ± 3.81, respectively; p<.001), and a worse quality of life in both mental (34.60 ± 7.45 vs. 46.01 ± 7.83, p<.001) and physical (43.50 ± 9.37 vs. 52.94 ± 4.78, p<.001) component summary. CONCLUSIONS: Our results give early insight into the urgent need to provide continuity of care for patients at the community-level, adequate PPE to GPs and a clear guidance from public health institutions. A precarious healthcare system both at a national and regional level might have triggered negative mental health outcomes in Italian GPs.","Amerio, Andrea; Bianchi, Davide; Santi, Francesca; Costantini, Luigi; Odone, Anna; Signorelli, Carlo; Costanza, Alessandra; Serafini, Gianluca; Amore, Mario; Aguglia, Andrea",Acta Biomed,305,13

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 39-question, web-based survey was sent to all urologist members of the Brazilian Society of Urology. We assessed socio-demographic, professional, health and behavior parameters. The primary goal was to evaluate changes in urologists' clinical practice and income after two months of COVID-19. We also looked at geographical differences based on the incidence rates of COVID-19 in different states. RESULTS: Among 766 urologists who completed the survey, a reduction &#8805; 50% of patient visits, elective and emergency surgeries was reported by 83.2%, 89.6% and 54.8%, respectively. An income reduction of &#8805; 50% was reported by 54.3%. Measures to reduce costs were implemented by most. Video consultations were performed by 38.7%. Modifications in health and lifestyle included weight gain (32.9%), reduced physical activity (60.0%), increased alcoholic intake (39.9%) and reduced sexual activity (34.9%). Finally, 13.5% of Brazilian urologists were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and about one third required hospitalization. Urologists from the highest COVID-19 incidence states were at a higher risk to have a reduction of patient visits and non-essential surgeries (OR=2.95, 95% CI 1.86 - 4.75; p< 0.0001) and of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 (OR=4.36 95%CI 1.74-10.54, p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 produced massive disturbances in Brazilian urologists' practice, with major reductions in patient visits and surgical procedures. Distressing consequences were also observed on physicians' income, health and personal lives. These findings are probably applicable to other medical specialties.","Gomes, Cristiano M; Favorito, Luciano A; Henriques, João Victor T; Canalini, Alfredo F; Anzolch, Karin M J; de Carvalho Fernandes, Roni; Bellucci, Carlos H S; Silva, Caroline S; Wroclawski, Marcelo L; Pompeo, Antonio Carlos L; de Bessa, José",Int Braz J Urol,305,16

Real Time RT-PCR assay was applied to determine the virus presence and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were evaluated using SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG kits. 113 patients were confirmed for COVID-19 infection. The patients were followed until negative PCR achieved. The median viral shedding among studied population was obtained 34.16 (±17.65) days which was not significantly associated with age, sex and underlying diseases.

There is currently no drug or vaccine for COVID-19, but it has been revealed that some commercially available drugs are promising, at least for treating symptoms. Among them, remdesivir, which can block the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in old SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses, has been prescribed to COVID-19 patients in many countries. A recent experiment showed that remdesivir binds to SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibition constant of µM, but the exact target has not been reported. In this work, combining molecular docking, steered molecular dynamics, and umbrella sampling, we examined its binding affinity to two targets including the main protease (Mpro), also known as 3C-like protease, and RdRp. We showed that remdesivir binds to Mpro slightly weaker than to RdRp, and the corresponding inhibition constants, consistent with the experiment, fall to the µM range. The binding mechanisms of remdesivir to two targets differ in that the electrostatic interaction is the main force in stabilizing the RdRp-remdesivir complex, while the van der Waals interaction dominates in the Mpro-remdesivir case. Our result indicates that remdesivir can target not only RdRp but also Mpro, which can be invoked to explain why this drug is effective in treating COVID-19. We have identified residues of the target protein that make the most important contribution to binding affinity, and this information is useful for drug development for this disease.","Nguyen, Hoang Linh; Thai, Nguyen Quoc; Truong, Duc Toan; Li, Mai Suan",J. phys. chem.

This study aimed to determine whether associations of changes in living arrangement with mental disorders could be moderated or mediated during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data were a cross-sectional and international population-based survey data collected as part of theCOVID-19 pandemic. Participants included nationally representative general population probability samples of adults (≥ 18 years) during COVID-19 pandemic (N=16,784). Main mental measures were reflected by loneliness assessed by UCLA Loneliness Scale Version 3, anxiety assessed by Generalised Anxiety Disorder 2-item, and depressed mood assessed by The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 in the survey. With control variables, all the mediation models were conducted by Stata mode. Potential influencing effects of social contact and social support as moderators were analyzed using Hayes’s PROCESS macro. Results: Among the participants, prevalence of mental disorders was high. Logistic regression indicated that changes in living arrangement had significant associations with anxiety (AOR=1.127, 95% CI: 1.018– 1.249) and depression (AOR =1.142, 95% CI: 1.027– 1.269). Mediation models indicated that indirect, direct, and total effects of changes in living arrangement on mental disorders through COVID-symptoms;change in alcohol use;and social contact were significant. Indirect, direct, and total effects of changes in living arrangement on loneliness and depression through social support were significant. Moderation analysis indicated that moderation model 1 in AF Hayes Process procedure was accepted. Conclusion: This study indicated that associations of changes in living arrangement with mental disorders could be mediated by COVID-symptoms, changes in alcohol use, social contact, and social support and moderated by social support during COVID-19 pandemic. The finding in this study might provide better understanding of the mechanisms by which social support might contribute to the resolving mental disorders.","Guan, Ming",Psychology Research and Behavior Management,305,23

The pilot study examined physician trainee performance in a simulation where hitting is observed between caregiver and child during a medical visit and to assess physician self-reported experiences, opinions, and comfort when observing CP in a simulation. METHODS: We ran 7 simulations where one pediatric resident, emergency medicine resident, or pediatric emergency medicine fellow participated in the simulation while a group of similar trainees observed. All participants were given a postsurvey, followed by a semistructured debriefing led by a child abuse pediatrician. RESULTS: Thirty-seven physician trainees participated; 7 engaged in the simulation while 30 observed. The majority (6/7) did not de-escalate the increasingly aggravated parent prior to hitting, 4 of 7 did not recommend that the caregiver refrain from CP, and most (5/7) did not provide education to the parent about more appropriate discipline. The majority (91.4%) believe that a physician should intervene when a parent hits or spanks his/her child in the hospital setting, highlighting the incongruity between this belief and their performance in/knowledge of intervening. All participants stated they would benefit from additional education and training on CP.

COVID-19 disease severity is worse in older obese patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease. Cell binding and entry of betacoronaviruses is via their surface spike glycoprotein; SARS-CoV binds to the metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), MERS-CoV utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and recent modeling of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein predicts that it can interact with human DPP4 in addition to ACE2. DPP4 is a ubiquitous membrane-bound aminopeptidase that circulates in plasma; it is multifunctional with roles in nutrition, metabolism, and immune and endocrine systems. DPP4 activity differentially regulates glucose homeostasis and inflammation via its enzymatic activity and nonenzymatic immunomodulatory effects. The importance of DPP4 for the medical community has been highlighted by the approval of DPP4 inhibitors, or gliptins, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review discusses the dysregulation of DPP4 in COVID-19 comorbid conditions; DPP4 activity is higher in older individuals and increased plasma DPP4 is a predictor of the onset of metabolic syndrome. DPP4 upregulation may be a determinant of COVID-19 disease severity, which creates interest regarding the use of gliptins in management of COVID-19. Also, knowledge of the chemistry and biology of DPP4 could be utilized to develop novel therapies to block viral entry of some betacoronaviruses, potentially including SARS-CoV-2.","Bassendine, Margaret F; Bridge, Simon H; McCaughan, Geoffrey W; Gorrell, Mark D",J. diabetes (Online),305,28

Regulatory B cells (Bregs) and CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are subgroups of immunoregulatory cells involved in modulating autoimmunity, inflammation, and transplantation reactions. Herein, by studying the number and function of Breg and Treg cell subsets in patients with AML, we explored their potential role in the pathogenesis of AML. Newly diagnosed AML patients, AML patients in complete remission, and healthy controls were enrolled. Flow cytometry was used to detect percentages of Bregs and Tregs. ELISA was conducted to detect IL-10 and TGF-ß in plasma. The mRNA levels of IL-10 and Foxp3 were measured with RT-qPCR. The relationship of Bregs and Tregs with the clinicopathological parameters was analyzed. There was a significant reduction in the frequencies of Bregs and an increase of Tregs in newly diagnosed AML patients compared with healthy controls. Meanwhile, patients in complete remission exhibited levels of Bregs and Tregs comparable to healthy controls. Furthermore, compared with healthy controls and AML patients in complete remission, newly diagnosed AML patients had increased plasma IL-10 but reduced TGF-ß. IL-10 and Foxp3 mRNA levels were upregulated in the newly diagnosed AML patients. However, there were no significant differences in IL-10 and Foxp3 mRNA levels between patients in complete remission and healthy controls. Bregs and Tregs have abnormal distribution in AML patients, suggesting that they might play an important role in regulating immune responses in AML.","Dong, Qiaofeng; Li, Guosheng; Fozza, Claudio; Wang, Shuli; Yang, Shuhuan; Sang, Yuqi; Liu, Xinguang; Chen, Chunyan",Biomed Res Int,305,22

Oman is no exception to this, with several studies indicating high levels of anxiety and depression among the Omani public. There is a need for adaptive and effective interventions that aim to improve the elevated levels of psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to comparatively assess the efficacy of therapist-guided online therapy with that of self-help, internet-based therapy focusing on COVID-19-induced symptoms of anxiety and depression among individuals living in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a 6-week-long pragmatic randomized controlled trial involving 60 participants who were recruited from a study sample surveyed for symptoms of anxiety or depression among the Omani public amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in the intervention group were allocated to receive 1 online session per week for 6 weeks from certified psychotherapists in Oman; these sessions were conducted in Arabic or English. The psychotherapists utilized cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy interventions. Participants in the control group received an automatic weekly newsletter via email containing self-help information and tips to cope with distress associated with COVID-19. The information mainly consisted of behavioral tips revolving around the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. The primary outcome was measured by comparing the change in the mean scores of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale from the baseline to the end of the study (ie, after 6 sessions) between the two groups. The secondary outcome was to compare the proportions of participants with depression and anxiety between the two groups. RESULTS: Data from 46 participants were analyzed (intervention group n=22, control group n=24). There was no statistical difference in the baseline characteristics between both groups. Analysis of covariance indicated a significant reduction in the GAD-7 scores (F1,43=7.307; P=.01) between the two groups after adjusting for baseline scores. GAD-7 scores of participants in the intervention group were considerably more reduced than those of participants in the control group (ß=-3.27; P=.01). Moreover, a greater reduction in mean PHQ-9 scores was observed among participants in the intervention group (F1,43=8.298; P=.006) than those in the control group (ß=-4.311; P=.006). Although the levels of anxiety and depression reduced in both study groups, the reduction was higher in the intervention group (P=.049) than in the control group (P=.02).

Here, the role of sensory nerve fibers in this abnormal cell fate decision is investigated using a severe extremity injury model in mice. Soft tissue trauma results in NGF (Nerve growth factor) expression, particularly within perivascular cell types. Consequently, NGF-responsive axonal invasion occurs which precedes osteocartilaginous differentiation. Surgical denervation impedes axonal ingrowth, with significant delays in cartilage and bone formation. Likewise, either deletion of Ngf or two complementary methods to inhibit its receptor TrkA (Tropomyosin receptor kinase A) lead to similar delays in axonal invasion and osteochondral differentiation. Mechanistically, single-cell sequencing suggests a shift from TGFß to FGF signaling activation among pre-chondrogenic cells after denervation. Finally, analysis of human pathologic specimens and databases confirms the relevance of NGF-TrkA signaling in human disease. In sum, NGF-mediated TrkA-expressing axonal ingrowth drives abnormal osteochondral differentiation after soft tissue trauma. NGF-TrkA signaling inhibition may have dual therapeutic use in soft tissue trauma, both as an analgesic and negative regulator of aberrant stem cell differentiation.","Lee, Seungyong; Hwang, Charles; Marini, Simone; Tower, Robert J; Qin, Qizhi; Negri, Stefano; Pagani, Chase A; Sun, Yuxiao; Stepien, David M; Sorkin, Michael; Kubiak, Carrie A; Visser, Noelle D; Meyers, Carolyn A; Wang, Yiyun; Rasheed, Husain A; Xu, Jiajia; Miller, Sarah; Huber, Amanda K; Minichiello, Liliana; Cederna, Paul S; Kemp, Stephen W P; Clemens, Thomas L; James, Aaron W; Levi, Benjamin",Nat Commun,305,26

While obesity seems to aggravate the course of disease, the actual impact of the BMI and the cutoff which increases illness severity are still under investigation. The aim of the study was to analyze whether the BMI represented a risk factor for respiratory failure, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and death. Research design and methods: A retrospective cohort study of 482 consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalised between March 1 and April 20, 2020. Logistic regression analysis and Cox proportion Hazard models including demographic characteristics and comorbidities were carried out to predict the endpoints within 30 days from the onset of symptoms. Results: Of 482 patients, 104 (21.6%) had a BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2. At logistic regression analysis, a BMI between 30 and 34.9 kg/m2 significantly increased the risk of respiratory failure (OR: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.31-4.09, P = 0.004) and admission to the ICU (OR: 4.96; 95% CI: 2.53-9.74, P < 0.001).

Early data suggest elevated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, but relationships to disease phenotype and downstream regulators of inflammation in the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) are unknown. We aimed to determine the relationship between RAS gene expression relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung with disease characteristics in COPD, and the regulation of newly identified SARS-CoV-2 receptors and spike-cleaving proteases, important for SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We quantified gene expression using RNA sequencing of epithelial brushings and bronchial biopsies from 31 COPD and 37 control subjects. RESULTS: ACE2 gene expression (log2-fold change (FC)) was increased in COPD compared to ex-smoking (HV-ES) controls in epithelial brushings (0.25, p = 0.042) and bronchial biopsies (0.23, p = 0.050), and correlated with worse lung function (r = - 0.28, p = 0.0090). ACE2 was further increased in frequent exacerbators compared to infrequent exacerbators (0.51, p = 0.00045) and associated with use of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) (0.50, p = 0.0034), having cardiovascular disease (0.23, p = 0.048) or hypertension (0.34, p = 0.0089), and inhaled corticosteroid use in COPD subjects in bronchial biopsies (0.33, p = 0.049). Angiotensin II receptor type (AGTR)1 and 2 expression was decreased in COPD bronchial biopsies compared to HV-ES controls with log2FC of -0.26 (p = 0.033) and - 0.40, (p = 0.0010), respectively. However, the AGTR1:2 ratio was increased in COPD subjects compared with HV-ES controls, log2FC of 0.57 (p = 0.0051). Basigin, a newly identified potential SARS-CoV-2 receptor was also upregulated in both brushes, log2FC of 0.17 (p = 0.0040), and bronchial biopsies, (log2FC of 0.18 (p = 0.017), in COPD vs HV-ES. Transmembrane protease, serine (TMPRSS)2 was not differentially regulated between control and COPD. However, various other spike-cleaving proteases were, including TMPRSS4 and Cathepsin B, in both epithelial brushes (log2FC of 0.25 (p = 0.0012) and log2FC of 0.56 (p = 5.49E-06), respectively) and bronchial biopsies (log2FC of 0.49 (p = 0.00021) and log2FC of 0.246 (p = 0.028), respectively).

METHODS: A systematic electronic search of PubMed, Cochrane and MedRxiv database using specific keywords was made up till June 17, 2020. Full text of all the original articles with supplementary appendix that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were retrieved and a detailed analysis of results were represented. RESULTS: Of the 5 studies (4 retrospective studies and 1 quasi-prospective study) conducted for evaluating the role of corticosteroids, 3 studies have shown benefit, while 2 studies shown no benefit and there was a suggestion of significant harm in critical cases in one sub-study. RECOVERY trial is the only randomized controlled trial that has shown a significant reduction of death by 35% in ventilated patients and by 20% amongst patients on supplemental oxygen therapy with the dexamethasone, although no benefit was observed in mild cases. CONCLUSIONS: While the results from retrospective studies are heterogenous and difficult to infer of a definitive protective benefit with corticosteroids, RECOVERY trial found a significantly better outcome with dexamethasone, mostly in severe cases. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to replicate the outcome shown in RECOVERY trial for a substantial conclusion.","Singh, Awadhesh Kumar; Majumdar, Sujoy; Singh, Ritu; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Metab Syndr,305,20

Despite editorials evaluating neurosurgery responses to 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), data reporting effects of COVID-19 on neurosurgical case volume, census, and resident illness are lacking. The aim of this study was to present a real-world analysis of neurosurgical volumes, resident deployment, and unique challenges encountered during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 outbreak peak in New York City. METHODS: Daily census and case volume data were prospectively collected throughout the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 outbreak in spring 2020. Neurosurgical census was compared against COVID-19 system-wide data. Neurosurgical cases during the crisis were analyzed and compared with 7-week periods from 2019 and early 2020. Resident deployment and illness were reviewed. RESULTS: From March 16, 2020, to May 5, 2020, residents participated in 72 operations and 69 endovascular procedures compared with 448 operations and 253 endovascular procedures from January 2020 to February 2020 and 530 operations and 340 endovascular procedures from March 2019 to May 2019. There was a 59% reduction in neurosurgical census during the outbreak (median 24 patients, 2.75 average total cases daily). COVID-19 neurosurgical admissions peaked in concert with the system-wide pandemic. Three residents demonstrated COVID-19 symptoms (no hospitalizations occurred) for a total 24 workdays lost (median 7 workdays). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide real-world guidance on neurosurgical infrastructure needs during a COVID-19 outbreak. While redeployment to support the COVID-19 response was required, a significant need remained to continue to provide critical neurosurgical service.","Rothrock, Robert J; Maragkos, Georgios A; Schupper, Alexander J; McNeill, Ian T; Oermann, Eric K; Yaeger, Kurt A; Gilligan, Jeffrey; Bederson, Joshua B; Mocco, J D",World neurosurgery (Online),305,1

India has a high prevalence of VDD. We hypothesized that VDD as measured by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) &amp;lt;20 ng/mL is associated with severe COVID-19 infection. Outcomes were assessed by the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement (OSCI)1, the need for oxygen therapy, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), and inflammatory markers. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was proven by RT-PCR on the nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV2. Serum 25OHD and PTH were measured in addition to the standard protocol for COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records and analyzed using SPSS v22.0. Patients with OSCI score &amp;lt;5 were classified as mild and ≥5 as severe disease. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. A total of 410 patients (127 females, 9 pediatric, 17 asymptomatic) were included with a median age of 54 years (6–92 years) with 272(66.3%) having at least one co-morbid condition, including diabetes (190, 46.3%) and hypertension (164,40%). Patients with VDD (197,48%) were significantly younger (46.7±17.1 vs. 57.8±14.7 years) and had lesser prevalence of diabetes and hypertension (39.1% vs 52.4%, 29.4% vs 49.5%). Proportion of severe cases (26,13.2% vs. 31,14.6%), mortality (4, 2% vs. 11, 5.2%), oxygen requirement (68,34.5% vs.92,43.4), ICU admission (29, 14.7% vs. 42, 19.8%), need for inotropes (7,3.6% vs.12,5.7%) was not significantly different between patients with VDD and those with normal 25OHD level. The proportion of severe cases was similar across all 25OHD categories. There was no significant correlation between 25OHD levels and outcome OSCI, inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, D-dimer, ferritin, LDH). PTH levels positively correlated with D-dimer (r 0.117, p- 0.019), ferritin (r 0.132, p-0.010) and LDH (r0.124, p-0.018). Amongst VDD patients, 128(64.9%) were treated with cholecalciferol with a median dose of 60000 IU. The proportion of severe cases, oxygen, or ICU admission was not significantly different in the treated vs. untreated group. In conclusion, baseline levels of 25OHD did not determine the severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 or levels of inflammatory markers.

In this commentary, we discuss two essential changes that Homeless Health Care Los Angeles (HHCLA) made to modify existing medication for addiction treatment (MAT) services to address the specific treatment needs of this high-risk population during COVID-19. First, HHCLA implemented a novel ""telephone booth"" model that allowed socially distanced on-site ""face-to-face"" treatment of syringe exchange patients; this model helped us to overcome the inherent challenges of using traditional telemedicine approaches (e.g., video, mobile telephone) with this disadvantaged patient population. Second, HHCLA transitioned from on-site direct dispensing of MAT medications in our providers' offices to a less contact- and time-intensive ""coordinated pharmacy"" model that allowed patients the freedom to obtain MAT medications off-site from participating pharmacies. Our data indicate that implementing these COVID-19-related changes effectively maintained patient enrollment and engagement in MAT-illuminating new, potentially effective models for delivering MAT that meet the critical health and safety needs of syringe exchange patients following COVID-19.","Tringale, Rolando; Subica, Andrew M",J Subst Abuse Treat,305,1

Sci. 2018, 9, 956-972) to the use of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) cards to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations using polarizable many-body force fields. The new high-performance module allows for an efficient use of single- and multiple-GPU architectures ranging from research laboratories to modern supercomputer centers. After detailing an analysis of our general scalable strategy that relies on OpenACC and CUDA, we discuss the various capabilities of the package. Among them, the multiprecision possibilities of the code are discussed. If an efficient double precision implementation is provided to preserve the possibility of fast reference computations, we show that a lower precision arithmetic is preferred providing a similar accuracy for molecular dynamics while exhibiting superior performances. As Tinker-HP is mainly dedicated to accelerate simulations using new generation point dipole polarizable force field, we focus our study on the implementation of the AMOEBA model. Testing various NVIDIA platforms including 2080Ti, 3090, V100, and A100 cards, we provide illustrative benchmarks of the code for single- and multicards simulations on large biosystems encompassing up to millions of atoms. The new code strongly reduces time to solution and offers the best performances to date obtained using the AMOEBA polarizable force field.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially TLR4 which participates in mucosal immunity, may be involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether sIgA and TLR4 interact to mediate kidney damage in IgAN patients. IgAN patients with positive sIgA deposition in renal tissues were screened by immunofluorescence assay. Patient salivary sIgA (P-sIgA) was collected and purified by jacalin affinity chromatography. Salivary sIgA from healthy volunteers was used as a control (N-sIgA). Expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF-&#954;B, TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and MCP-1 were detected in the mesangial area of IgAN patients by immunohistochemistry, the expression levels in patients with positive sIgA deposition were higher than that with negative sIgA deposition. Human renal mesangial cells (HRMCs) were cultured in vitro, flow cytometry showed that P-sIgA bound HRMCs significantly better than N-sIgA. HRMCs were cultured in the presence of sIgA (400 µg/mL) for 24 h, compared with cells cultured with N-sIgA, HRMCs cultured in vitro with P-sIgA showed enhanced expression of TLR4, increased secretion of TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and MCP-1, and increased expression of MyD88/NF-&#954;B. TLR4 shRNA silencing and NF-&#954;B inhibition both reduced the ability of HRMCs to synthesize TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and MCP-1. Our results indicate that sIgA may induce high expression of TLR4 in HRMCs and further activate downstream signalling pathways, prompting HRMCs to secrete multiple cytokines and thereby mediating kidney damage in IgAN patients.","Zhang, Junjun; Mi, Yiming; Zhou, Ruwen; Liu, Zhangsuo; Huang, Bo; Guo, Ruxue; Wang, Panfei; Lu, Yanru; Zhou, Yali; Quan, Songxia",J. nephrol,305,16

Nonetheless, the extent of learner participation and completion of these courses remains unknown. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess learner behaviors in synchronous online prosthodontic continuing education lectures in China during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All live online prosthodontic courses held by an online dental school in China from February to May 2020 were retrieved. The no-cost lectures could be accessed anonymously and viewed repeatedly on the day of broadcast. Learning behavior data (teacher speaking time, audience total, timing of first visit to the online classroom, viewing time, and completion rate) were obtained. Learning progress was calculated by dividing viewing time by teacher speaking time. When a learner progressed through 95% of a lecture, the lecture was considered completed. RESULTS: A total of 41 781 learners participated in 18 online prosthodontic courses, which had a mean duration of 77.2 ±15.8 minutes. For each lecture, 2321 ±1454 participants attended, with 510 ±404 participants completing each session. There were 13 098 participants (31.35%) who viewed the lectures for less than 1 minute. Approximately half of the participants viewed the lectures for less than 10 minutes, with their learning progress failing to pass 10%. The average completion rate was 21.97%, with variation in completion rate dependent on when a learner first visited the online classroom.

Teachers had to switch to online courses at short notice. The associated developmental push of digital teaching methods, such as online teaching, has anticipated changes, some of which are tantamount to establishment. This study examines the experiences and effects of these changes from the teachers' perspective. Methods: We conducted ten guideline-based anonymized e-mail interviews with lecturers of the Medical Faculty of the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. Questions were asked on the subject areas of advantages and disadvantages, teaching experience and the future of digital teaching. The qualitative evaluation was based on Mayring. Results: The assessment of the digitization of face-to-face courses could be described by the inductively formed categories ""social aspects"", ""methodological aspects"", ""institutional aspects"", ""technical aspects"" and ""temporal-spatial aspects"". These revealed in particular concerns about the lack of personal exchange, temporal-spatial advantages, technical barriers and disagreement about the future role of digital teaching. Conclusion: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face courses were replaced by online teaching, which is currently an accepted part of the curriculum. The results show, that teachers were able to implement the comprehensive ad-hoc digitization of theoretical courses well, although previously known problem areas were aggravated. Furthermore, a fundamental examination of the future role of digitized courses in medical education must take place.","Gottschalk, Marc; Werwick, Katrin; Albert, Christian; Weinert, Soenke; Schmeißer, Alexander; Stieger, Philipp; Braun-Dullaeus, Ruediger C",GMS J Med Educ,305,16

A recently published article points to a method of prevention and prophylaxis of COVID-19 through the use of anti-malarial drugs such as the 4-aminoquinolones: chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, based on their mechanisms of action against SARS-CoV-2. This report aims to explore the correlation between COVID-19 cases and countries where malaria is prevalent using statistical means. It is hypothesized that countries where malaria is endemic will have few cases of COVID-19 since these countries use the 4-aminoquinolone antimalarial drugs for prophylaxis. Statistical analysis demonstrates that the numbers and incidence of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths are substantially lower (multiple-fold lower) in countries with the highest prevalence of malaria. The difference between both the COVID-19 incidence rate and the COVID-19 mortality rate in malaria prevalent countries compared to COVID-19 prevalent countries is statistically significant (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04 respectively). This study provides further evidence that anti-malaria drugs may prove essential to breaking the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and preventing COVID-19 and COVID-19 related mortality. As the pandemic continues to evolve and doctors and researchers across the globe try to attenuate or stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the medical community should not overlook the potential role of the 4-aminoquinolones anti-malarial drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and 8-aminoquinolone anti-malaria drugs, tafenoquine and primaquine, as a prophylaxis.","Adams, Danya; Alshaban, Fouad",Eye Rep.,305,24

However, previous studies on pregnant patients were limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant and nonpregnant women with COVID-19. METHODS: This study retrospectively collected epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, imaging, management, and outcome data of 43 childbearing-age women patients (including 17 pregnant and 26 nonpregnant patients) who presented with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China from January 19 to March 2, 2020. Clinical outcomes were followed up to March 28, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 43 childbearing-age women in this study, none developed a severe adverse illness or died. The median ages of pregnant and nonpregnant women were 33.0 and 33.5 years, respectively. Pregnant women had a markedly higher proportion of history exposure to hospitals within 2 weeks before onset compared to nonpregnant women (9/17, 53% vs 5/26, 19%, P=.02) and a lower proportion of other family members affected (4/17, 24% vs 19/26, 73%, P=.004). Fever (8/17, 47% vs 18/26, 69%) and cough (9/17, 53% vs 12/26, 46%) were common onsets of symptoms for the two groups. Abdominal pain (n=4, 24%), vaginal bleeding (n=1, 6%), reduced fetal movement (n=1, 6%), and increased fetal movement (n=2, 13%) were observed at onset in the 17 pregnant patients. Higher neutrophil and lower lymphocyte percent were observed in the pregnant group compared to the nonpregnant group (79% vs 56%, P<.001; 15% vs 33%, P<.001, respectively). In both groups, we observed an elevated concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase. Concentrations of alkaline phosphatase and D-dimer in the pregnant group were significantly higher than those of the nonpregnant group (119.0 vs 48.0 U/L, P<.001; 2.1 vs 0.3µg/mL, P<.001, respectively). Both pregnant (4/10, 40%) and nonpregnant (8/15, 53%) women tested positive for influenza A virus. A majority of pregnant and nonpregnant groups received antiviral (13/17, 76% vs 25/26, 96%) and antibiotic (13/17, 76% vs 23/26, 88%) therapy. Additionally, both pregnant (2/11, 18%) and nonpregnant (2/19, 11%) recovered women redetected positive for SARS-CoV-2 after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology and clinical and laboratory features of pregnant women with COVID-19 were diverse and atypical, which increased the difficulty of diagnosis. Most pregnant women with COVID-19 were mild and moderate, and rarely developed severe pneumonia or severe adverse outcomes.","Wei, Lijie; Gao, Xuan; Chen, Suhua; Zeng, Wanjiang; Wu, Jianli; Lin, Xingguang; Zhang, Huiting; Mwamaka Sharifu, Lali; Chen, Ling; Feng, Ling; Wang, Shaoshuai",J Med Internet Res,305,30

This has intensified the clinical uncertainty already experienced by primary care clinicians when assessing suspected COVID-19 patients and has prompted the use of risk prediction scores, such as NEWS2, to assess severity and guide treatment. However, the risk prediction tools available have not been validated in a community setting and are not designed to capture the idiosyncrasy of COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to produce a multivariate risk prediction tool (RECAP-V1) to support primary care clinicians in the identification of those COVID-19 patients that are at higher risk of deterioration and facilitate the early escalation of their treatment with the aim of improving patient outcomes. METHODS: The study follows a prospective cohort observational design, whereby patients presenting in primary care with signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 will be followed and their data linked to hospital outcomes (hospital admission and death). Data collection will be carried out by primary care clinicians in four arms, i.e., North West London Clinical Commissioning Groups (NWL CCGs), Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC), Covid Clinical Assessment Service (CCAS) and South East London CCGs (Doctaly platform) and involves the use of an electronic template that incorporates a list of items (known as RECAP-V0) thought to be associated with disease outcome according to previous qualitative work. Data collected will be linked to patient outcomes in highly secure environments (iCARE and ORCHID). We will then use multivariate logistic regression analyses for model development and validation. RESULTS: Recruitment of participants started in October 2020. Initially, only NWL CCGs and RCGP RSC arms were active. As of 24th of March 2021, we have recruited a combined sample of 3,827 participants in these two arms. CCAS and Doctaly joined the study in February 2021, with CCAS starting recruitment process on the 15th of March 2021. The first part of the analysis (RECAP-V1 model development) is planned to start in April 2021 using the first half of the NWL CCGs and RCGP RSC combined dataset. Posteriorly, the model will be validated with the rest of NWL CCGs and RCGP RSC data as well as CCAS and Doctaly datasets. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee on the 27th of May 2020 (IRAS number 283024, REC reference number: 20/NW/0266) and badged as NIHR Urgent Public Health Study on 14th of October 2020. CONCLUSIONS: We believe the validated RECAP-V1 early warning score will be a valuable tool for the assessment of suspected COVID-19 patients' severity in the community, either in face-to-face or remote consultations, and will facilitate the timely escalation of treatment with the potential to improve patient outcomes.

Some previous evidence has suggested COVID-19-associated strokes are more severe with worse outcomes for patients, but further studies are needed to confirm these findings. The aim of this study was to determine the association between COVID-19 and mortality for patients with ischaemic stroke in a large multicentre study. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic medical records of inpatients from 50 healthcare organizations, predominately from the USA. Patients with ischaemic stroke within 30 days of COVID-19 were identified. COVID-19 was determined from diagnosis codes or a positive test result identified with CO-VID-19-specific laboratory codes between January 20, 2020, and October 1, 2020. Historical controls with ischaemic stroke without COVID-19 were identified in the period January 20, 2019, to October 1, 2019. 1:1 propensity score matching was used to balance the cohorts with and without CO-VID-19 on characteristics including age, sex, race and comorbidities. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all-cause 60-day mortality by COVID-19 status were produced. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 954 inpatients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19. During the same time period in 2019, there were 48,363 inpatients with ischaemic stroke without COVID-19 (historical controls). Compared to patients with ischaemic stroke without COVID-19, patients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 had a lower mean age, had a lower prevalence of white patients, a higher prevalence of black or African American patients and a higher prevalence of hypertension, previous cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, neoplasms, and mental disorders due to known physiological conditions. After propensity score matching, there were 952 cases and 952 historical controls; cases and historical controls were better balanced on all included characteristics (all p > 0.05). After propensity score matching, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed the survival probability was significantly lower in ischaemic stroke patients with COVID-19 (78.3% vs. 91.0%, log-rank test p < 0.0001). The odds of 60-day mortality were significantly higher for patients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 compared to the propensity score-matched historical controls (odds ratio: 2.51 [95% confidence interval 1.88-3.34]). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Ischaemic stroke patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher 60-day all-cause mortality compared to propensity score-matched historical controls (ischaemic stroke patients without COVID-19).","Harrison, Stephanie L; Fazio-Eynullayeva, Elnara; Lane, Deirdre A; Underhill, Paula; Lip, Gregory Y H",Cerebrovasc Dis,305,16

In late 2019, the global medical community faced the new infection transmitted through airborne droplets. Being initially identified as one of the acute respiratory viral infections, the novel coronavirus infection was included in the list of diseases that pose a risk to others on January 31, 2020. A little later, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the infection reached the level of a pandemic. The high-risk group includes the elderly, patients with severe concomitant diseases and immunodeficiency, as well as pregnant women with altered immune responsiveness. At the same time, the pregnancy status restricts the use of some methods for instrumental diagnosis and anti-coronavirus therapy. An obstetrician-gynecologist is responsible not only for the health of an infected woman, but also for that of her unborn child, therefore the specialist must know all the transmission routes of infection, follow epidemiological precautions, be able to identify early symptoms of the disease, perform thorough clinical assessment and provide timely adequate anti-coronavirus therapy. The management of women during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum should be carried out according to the potential risk of this infection.

We sought to determine the utility of lung ultrasound for early detection of pneumonia and for assessment of respiratory failure among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Six patients with confirmed COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were enrolled. All had undergone chest X-ray and chest computed tomography (CT) on the day of admission and underwent multiple point-of-care lung ultrasound scans over the course of their hospitalization. RESULTS: Lung ultrasound detected early abnormal findings of representative B-lines in a patient with a normal chest X-ray, corresponding to ground-glass opacities on the chest CT scan. The ultrasound findings improved as her clinical condition improved and her viral load decreased. In another minimally symptomatic patient without significant chest X-ray findings, the ultrasound showed B-lines, an early sign of pneumonia before abnormalities were detected on the chest CT scan. In two critically ill patients, ultrasound was performed to assess for evaluation of disease severity. In both patients, the clinicians conducted emergency rapid sequence intubation based on the ultrasound findings without awaiting the laboratory results and radiological reports. In two children, ultrasound was used to assess the improvement in their pneumonia, thus avoiding further imaging tests such as chest CT. CONCLUSION: Lung ultrasound is feasible and useful as a rapid, sensitive, and affordable point-of-care screening tool to detect pneumonia and assess the severity of respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Cho, Young-Jae; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Lee, Yunghee; Yoon, Joo Heung; Park, Ji Young; Jung, Jongtak; Lim, Sung Yoon; Lee, Hyunju; Yoon, Ho Il; Park, Kyoung Un; Kim, Hong Bin; Kim, Eu Suk",Korean J Intern Med,305,1

However, epidemiologic data on the associations of zinc and genetic susceptibility with the risk of dyslexia are limited. We aimed to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms in GRIN2B genes modify the association between zinc levels and dyslexia risk. METHODS: A case-control study of 240 dyslexic children and 230 healthy controls was conducted in Wuhan, Hangzhou and Jining city in China from April 2017 to April 2018. Zinc concentrations in urine samples were measured with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICPMS). Multiple imputation was used to impute missing values of covariates. We applied multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the effect in the study. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, we observed the associations of urinary zinc with dyslexia risk were modified by rs1805502 (Pinteraction = 0.048) in gene GRIN2B. About 2-fold increase in creatinine-corrected zinc levels was significantly related to a reduced risk of dyslexia [odds ratio (OR) = 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.29, 0.95 in rs1805502 mutation carriers]. CONCLUSIONS: The associations between zinc levels and dyslexia risk were modified by polymorphism of rs1805502 in gene GRIN2B.","Liu, Qi; Zhu, Bing; Xue, Qi; Xie, Xinyan; Zhou, Yu; Zhu, Kaiheng; Wan, Zihao; Wu, Hao; Zhang, Jiajia; Song, Ranran",Environ Res,305,23

The resulting COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the WHO in March 2020. By July 2020, COVID-19 was present in 213 countries and territories, with over 12 million confirmed cases and over half a million attributed deaths. Knowledge of other viral respiratory diseases suggests that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could be modulated by seasonally varying environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Many studies on the environmental sensitivity of COVID-19 are appearing online, and some have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Initially, these studies raised the hypothesis that climatic conditions would subdue the viral transmission rate in places entering the boreal summer, and that southern hemisphere countries would experience enhanced disease spread. For the latter, the COVID-19 peak would coincide with the peak of the influenza season, increasing misdiagnosis and placing an additional burden on health systems. In this review, we assess the evidence that environmental drivers are a significant factor in the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, globally and regionally. We critically assessed 42 peer-reviewed and 80 preprint publications that met qualifying criteria. Since the disease has been prevalent for only half a year in the northern, and one-quarter of a year in the southern hemisphere, datasets capturing a full seasonal cycle in one locality are not yet available. Analyses based on space-for-time substitutions, i.e., using data from climatically distinct locations as a surrogate for seasonal progression, have been inconclusive. The reported studies present a strong northern bias. Socio-economic conditions peculiar to the 'Global South' have been omitted as confounding variables, thereby weakening evidence of environmental signals. We explore why research to date has failed to show convincing evidence for environmental modulation of COVID-19, and discuss directions for future research. We conclude that the evidence thus far suggests a weak modulation effect, currently overwhelmed by the scale and rate of the spread of COVID-19. Seasonally modulated transmission, if it exists, will be more evident in 2021 and subsequent years.","Smit, Albertus J; Fitchett, Jennifer M; Engelbrecht, Francois A; Scholes, Robert J; Dzhivhuho, Godfrey; Sweijd, Neville A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),305,30

From a forensic point of view, this event is partly changing the manner in which forensic pathologists and all those who work in autopsy services operate, but above all, it is changing the patterns established for years by which cadavers are analyzed postmortem. OBJECTIVE.­: To present a review of the literature and a proposal for COVID-19 autopsy protocols. To contain the infection risk, a revision of all the protocols that until now have been applied to the examination of bodies that require autopsy services is required. DATA SOURCES.­: Currently, the diagnosis and postmortem analysis of positive or suspected COVID-19 cases plays a crucial role in scientific research. A review of the main recommendations proposed by international scientific societies regarding the risk of infection during autopsy was carried out. Scientific papers currently available via the PubMed NCBI search engine on COVID-19 postmortem diagnosis were also examined. CONCLUSIONS.­: Throughout the history of medicine, autopsy has been fundamental to the understanding of multiple pathogenic processes that are investigated postmortem. The purpose of the study is to propose an operating protocol that can be useful for all clinical and forensic autopsies, with particular reference to the correct methods to be applied to the examination of positive or suspected COVID-19 cases, regarding both the autopsy procedure and the collection and analysis of biological samples.","Aquila, Isabella; Sacco, Matteo Antonio; Abenavoli, Ludovico; Malara, Natalia; Arena, Vincenzo; Grassi, Simone; Ausania, Francesco; Boccuto, Luigi; Ricci, Cristoforo; Gratteri, Santo; Oliva, Antonio; Ricci, Pietrantonio",Arch Pathol Lab Med,305,30

We reviewed publications from January 2020 to January 2021, given that earlier documents were not relevant, to review findings on changes in substance use and overdoses during the pandemic. Additionally, this review of the literature also documents advocacy efforts, health service modification and challenges, as well as COVID-related health complications associated with substance use. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent work focused on identifying changes in the distribution and use of substances as well as the unique challenges to promoting the health of persons who use substances in the current pandemic. Although COVID-19 has triggered unprecedented innovations in the organizational and public policy, the use of certain substances (alcohol, cannabis, cigarettes, fentanyl, heroin, and opiates) is increasing internationally. Unique associations between substance use and pandemic-related adverse health outcomes were identified. In addition, the pandemic precipitated significant barriers and disruptions to care. SUMMARY: Given increased overdose rates and infections among people who use drugs, continued surveillance and vigilance are needed to assess changes and reduce use and adverse consequences during the continuing COVID-19 crisis. Changes are urgently needed to reduce adverse health outcomes because of treatment barriers and lack of adequate treatment options. Additionally, integrative approaches are necessary to promote the public health of persons who use substances.","Striley, Catherine W; Hoeflich, Carolin C",Curr Opin Psychiatry,305,3

'Flexible care' is a term that can be used to describe treatment administered outside the oncology ward, oncological outpatient clinic or office-based oncologist setting. Programmes that reduce travel burden by bringing cancer treatment to the patient's home, workplace or closer to the patient's home, in the form of satellite clinics or mobile cancer units, expand treatment capacity and are well received. Clinical trial data show that, compared with intravenous administration, subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of trastuzumab is preferred by patients with breast cancer (BC), saves healthcare professionals' (HCPs) time, reduces drug preparation and administration time and reduces direct and indirect costs. As such, s.c. trastuzumab is well suited to flexible care. The results of a Belgian study (BELIS) show that home administration of s.c. trastuzumab is feasible and preferred by patients with BC. Numerous programmes and pilot studies in Europe show that s.c. trastuzumab can be administered effectively in the patient's home, in primary care settings or local hospitals. Such programmes require planning, training, careful patient selection and technology to link patients, caregivers and specialists in oncology clinics. Once these elements are in place, flexible care offers patients with BC a choice of how treatment may be delivered and lead to improved quality of life, while reducing pressure on HCPs and hospitals. The concept of flexible care is particularly relevant amid the COVID-19 pandemic where guidelines have been developed encouraging remote care.","Wardley, A; Canon, J-L; Elsten, L; Peña Murillo, C; Badovinac Crnjevic, T; Fredriksson, J; Piccart, M",ESMO Open,305,1

OBJECTIVES: To collect data about the impact of COVID-19 emergency on access to care for PwMS and on MS treatment practices. METHODS: Between March and July 2020, the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) promoted an online survey covering patient access to care, management of relapses and visits, disease-modifying therapy (DMT) and experience with COVID-19. RESULTS: Three-hundred and sixty neurologists from 52 countries (68% from Europe) completed the survey. 98% reported COVID-19-related restrictions. Telemedicine was adopted to overcome the limited access to care and was newly activated (73%) or widely implemented (17%). 70% reported changes in DMT management. Interferons and glatiramer were considered safe. Dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide and fingolimod were considered safe except for patients developing lymphopenia.

Thus, there is evidence showing possible retrograde transmission of the virus from the olfactory epithelium to regions of the brain stem. METHODS: This is a literature review article. The research design method is an evidence-based rapid review. The present discourse aim is first to scrutinize and assess the available literature on COVID-19 repercussion on the central nervous system (CNS). Standard literature and database searches were implemented, gathered relevant material, and extracted information was then assessed. RESULTS: The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors being the receptor for the virus, the threat to the central nervous system is expected. Neurons and glial cells express ACE2 receptors in the CNS, and recent studies suggest that activated glial cells contribute to neuroinflammation and the devastating effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the CNS. The SARS-CoV-2-induced immune-mediated demyelinating disease, cerebrovascular damage, neurodegeneration, and depression are some of the neurological complications discussed here. CONCLUSION: This review correlates present clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients with possible neurological consequences in the future, thus preparing healthcare providers for possible future consequences of COVID-19.","Mahalakshmi, Arehally M; Ray, Bipul; Tuladhar, Sunanda; Bhat, Abid; Paneyala, Shasthara; Patteswari, Duraisamy; Sakharkar, Meena Kishore; Hamdan, Hamdan; Ojcius, David M; Bolla, Srinivasa Rao; Essa, Musthafa Mohamed; Chidambaram, Saravana Babu; Qoronfleh, M Walid",Immun Inflamm Dis,305,12

We report the results of a case-population study done in Madrid, Spain, since the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: In this case-population study, we consecutively selected patients aged 18 years or older with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital from seven hospitals in Madrid, who had been admitted between March 1 and March 24, 2020. As a reference group, we randomly sampled ten patients per case, individually matched for age, sex, region (ie, Madrid), and date of admission to hospital (month and day; index date), from Base de datos para la Investigación Farmacoepidemiológica en Atención Primaria (BIFAP), a Spanish primary health-care database, in its last available year (2018). We extracted information on comorbidities and prescriptions up to the month before index date (ie, current use) from electronic clinical records of both cases and controls. The outcome of interest was admission to hospital of patients with COVID-19. To minimise confounding by indication, the main analysis focused on assessing the association between COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital and use of RAAS inhibitors compared with use of other antihypertensive drugs. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, using conditional logistic regression. The protocol of the study was registered in the EU electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies, EUPAS34437. FINDINGS: We collected data for 1139 cases and 11â390 population controls. Among cases, 444 (39·0%) were female and the mean age was 69·1 years (SD 15·4), and despite being matched on sex and age, a significantly higher proportion of cases had pre-existing cardiovascular disease (OR 1·98, 95% CI 1·62-2·41) and risk factors (1·46, 1·23-1·73) than did controls. Compared with users of other antihypertensive drugs, users of RAAS inhibitors had an adjusted OR for COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital of 0·94 (95% CI 0·77-1·15). No increased risk was observed with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·80, 0·64-1·00) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (1·10, 0·88-1·37). Sex, age, and background cardiovascular risk did not modify the adjusted OR between use of RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, whereas a decreased risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital was found among patients with diabetes who were users of RAAS inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·53, 95% CI 0·34-0·80). The adjusted ORs were similar across severity degrees of COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: RAAS inhibitors do not increase the risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, including fatal cases and those admitted to intensive care units, and should not be discontinued to prevent a severe case of COVID-19.

We now report that MARCH8 also blocks the Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) incorporation via surface downregulation. To understand how these viral fusion proteins are downregulated, we investigated the effects of MARCH8 on EBOV GP maturation and externalization via the conventional secretion pathway. MARCH8 interacted with EBOV GP and furin when detected by immunoprecipitation and retained the GP/furin complex in the Golgi when their location was tracked by a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. MARCH8 did not reduce the GP expression or affect the GP modification by high-mannose N-glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but it inhibited the formation of complex N-glycans on the GP in the Golgi. Additionally, the GP O-glycosylation and furin-mediated proteolytic cleavage were also inhibited. Moreover, we identified a novel furin cleavage site on EBOV GP and found that only those fully glycosylated GPs were processed by furin and incorporated into virions. Furthermore, the GP shedding and secretion were all blocked by MARCH8. MARCH8 also blocked the furin-mediated cleavage of HIV-1 Env (gp160) and the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA). We conclude that MARCH8 has a very broad antiviral activity by prohibiting different viral fusion proteins from glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage in the Golgi, which inhibits their transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and incorporation into virions.IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses express three classes of fusion proteins that are required for their entry into host cells via mediating virus and cell membrane fusion. Class I fusion proteins are produced from influenza viruses, retroviruses, Ebola viruses, and coronaviruses. They are first synthesized as a type I transmembrane polypeptide precursor that is subsequently glycosylated and oligomerized. Most of these precursors are cleaved en route to the plasma membrane by a cellular protease furin in the late secretory pathway, generating the trimeric N-terminal receptor-binding and C-terminal fusion subunits. Here, we show that a cellular protein, MARCH8, specifically inhibits the furin-mediated cleavage of EBOV GP, HIV-1 Env, and H5N1 HA. Further analyses uncovered that MARCH8 blocked the EBOV GP glycosylation in the Golgi and inhibited its transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Thus, MARCH8 has a very broad antiviral activity by specifically inactivating different viral fusion proteins.","Yu, Changqing; Li, Sunan; Zhang, Xianfeng; Khan, Ilyas; Ahmad, Iqbal; Zhou, Yulong; Li, Shuo; Shi, Jing; Wang, Yu; Zheng, Yong-Hui",mBio (Online),305,17

AIM: To examine the association between the concentrations of cytokine blockers (infliximab, adalimumab and ustekinumab) and endoscopic remission of small bowel lesions. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at a single tertiary referral centre. Patients with Crohn's disease who received maintenance cytokine blocker therapy were recruited from April 2018 to May 2020. We performed balloon-assisted enteroscopy and collected serum samples to measure drug concentrations. The primary endpoint was the relationship between the concentrations of cytokine blockers and endoscopic remission in the small bowel. RESULTS: We enrolled 143 patients, 66, 44 and 33 of whom were receiving infliximab, adalimumab and ustekinumab, respectively. Enteroscopic findings showed that the rate of endoscopic remission of small bowel lesions was significantly lower than that of colonic lesions (P < 0.01). For each agent, the mean drug concentration in patients exhibiting endoscopic remission in the small bowel was higher than that observed in patients with endoscopic remission in the colon (but not in the small bowel) or with any active disease (either in the small bowel, colon or both).

In contrast, in human medicine, especially until the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, they were unimportant viruses associated with the common cold. This is a brief comparative review of the biology of coronaviral infections emphasizing the commonalities among the various members of the family and considering how the veterinary experience with coronaviruses can inform the response to SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are perhaps best viewed as mutation machines whose genetic sequences can readily change through genetic drift, recombination, and deletions from a large genome. However, to be of clinical concern, variants must have the perfect set of amino acids in the S protein receptor binding domain and in their replication-mediating nonstructural proteins. Extensive experience with veterinary coronaviral vaccines suggests that optimal clinical immunity is a tandem of mucosal and systemic responses induced by a combination of mucosal and parenteral vaccines.

Cependant, pour être une préoccupation clinique, les variants doivent avoir l’ensemble parfait d’acides aminés dans le domaine de liaison au récepteur de la protéine S et dans leurs protéines non structurelles induisant la réplication.

The researchers used descriptive phenomenology rooted in Husserl's philosophy. The qualitative data source included semistructured individual interviews. Convenience sampling yielded 10 senior-level nursing students in a community health nursing course. The analysis yielded 6 major themes: (1) fear of witnessing death, (2) contrasting care priorities in a hospice-dedicated versus acute care setting, (3) value of storytelling from hospice team members, (4) unprepared for EOL conversations, (5) guidance and support, and (6) benefit of hospice-dedicated experiential learning. The findings of this study support the use of expert hospice team members to guide and mentor students.

In the course of epidemics, societies grappled with sudden and unexpected mortality and also returned to fundamental questions about core social values. ""Epidemics,"" Rosenberg wrote, ""have always provided occasion for retrospective moral judgment"" (Rosenberg 1989, pp. 2, 9). Following Rosenberg's observations, this essay places COVID-19 in the context of epidemic history to examine common issues faced during health crises-moral, political, social, and individual. Each disease crisis unfolds in its own time and place. Yet, despite specific contexts, we can see patterns and recurring concerns in the history of pandemics: (1) pandemics and disease crises in the past, along with public health responses to them, have had implications for civil liberties and government authority; (2) disease crises have acted as a sort of stress test on society, revealing, amplifying or widening existing social fissures and health disparities; (3) pandemics have forced people to cope with uncertain knowledge about the origin and nature of disease, the best sources of therapies, and what the future will hold after the crisis. While historians are not prognosticators, understanding past experience offers new perspectives for the present.

However, there is still a lack of relevant investigation data, which can provide initial evidence for establishing or improving relevant laws and regulations, on people's willingness to donate biospecimens, and whether they agree to waive the right of obtaining informed consent in the special period of sudden outbreak of new infectious diseases. Objectives: To investigate people's willingness to donate their remnant biospecimens of clinical tests for research in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and their willingness to sign the informed consent for research using their biospecimens. Methods: We conducted a survey using an online questionnaire, which included questions on basic personal information, COVID-19-related information, donation of remnant biospecimens, willingness to sign informed consent, and reasons to do so. Results: Among the 721 valid responses, 620 respondents (86.0%) reported that they would be willing to donate their remnant biospecimens for research, of whom 434 (70.0%) reported that they would donate their remnant biospecimens without signing the informed consent. Of the 11 specified influencing factors, occupation, household income, and degree of concern about the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with willingness to donate remnant biospecimens. Gender and age were associated with willingness to donate remnant biospecimens without signing the informed consent. The main reasons for unwillingness to donate remnant biospecimens and sign the informed consent were a limited knowledge of research and privacy concerns. Conclusions: Most respondents reported that they would be willing to donate their remnant biospecimens for biomedical research without signing an informed consent in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of understanding of the proposed research and concerns about personal privacy were the main reasons for unwillingness to donate biospecimens and signing the informed consent.","Gao, Limin; Li, De; Liu, Xiangqian; Ren, Hong",Biopreserv. biobank.

The inhibitory effect of MK-4482 on SARS-CoV-2 replication is observed in animals when the drug is administered either beginning 12 h before or 12 h following infection in a high-risk exposure model.

In this study, we provide a cross-sectional analysis of the dynamics of B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We observe changes in B cell subsets consistent with a robust humoral immune response, including significant expansion of plasmablasts and activated receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific memory B cell populations. We observe elevated titers of Abs to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, full-length Spike, and nucleoprotein over the course of infection, with higher levels of RBD-specific IgG correlating with increased serum neutralization. Depletion of RBD-specific Abs from serum removed a major portion of neutralizing activity in most individuals. Some donors did retain significant residual neutralization activity, suggesting a potential Ab subset targeting non-RBD epitopes.

Current approaches are driven by practical considerations (e.g. first available virus isolate) rather than a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the virus strain chosen, which can lead to animal models that are not representative of the circulating or emerging clusters. Here, we suggest a combination of epidemiological, experimental and bioinformatic considerations when choosing virus strains for animal model generation. We discuss the currently chosen SARS-CoV-2 strains for international coronavirus disease (COVID-19) models in the context of their phylogeny as well as in a novel alignment-free bioinformatic approach. Unlike phylogenetic trees, which focus on individual shared mutations, this new approach assesses genome-wide co-developing functionalities and hence offers a more fluid view of the 'cloud of variances' that RNA viruses are prone to accumulate. This joint approach concludes that while the current animal models cover the existing viral strains adequately, there is substantial evolutionary activity that is likely not considered by the current models. Based on insights from the non-discrete alignment-free approach and experimental observations, we suggest isolates for future animal models.","Bauer, Denis C; Tay, Aidan P; Wilson, Laurence O W; Reti, Daniel; Hosking, Cameron; McAuley, Alexander J; Pharo, Elizabeth; Todd, Shawn; Stevens, Vicky; Neave, Matthew J; Tachedjian, Mary; Drew, Trevor W; Vasan, Seshadri S",Transbound Emerg Dis,305,16

In this study, we developed a peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-based real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay targeting the N gene to efficiently discriminate SARS-CoV-2 from other SARSr-CoVs in human clinical samples. Without compromising the sensitivity, this method significantly enhanced the specificity of SARS-CoV-2 detection by 100-fold as compared to conventional RT-qPCR. In addition, we designed an RT-qPCR method for the sensitive and universal detection of ORF3ab-E genes of SARSr-CoV with a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.3 RNA copies per microliter. Thus, the developed assay serves as a confirmative dual-target detection method. Our PNA-mediated dual-target RT-qPCR assay can detect clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples in the range of 18.10-35.19 Ct values with an 82.6-100% detection rate. Furthermore, our assay showed no cross-reactions with other coronaviruses such as human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, and OC43) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, influenza viruses (Type B, H1N1, H3N2, HPAI H5Nx, and H7N9), and other respiratory disease-causing viruses (MPV, RSV A, RSV B, PIV, AdV, and HRV).

In this study, changes in the epitopes of spike and orf8 proteins in SARS-CoV-2 of B.1.1.7 lineage were investigated. Genomic alignment of the SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7 with SARS-CoV-2/Wuhan showed the presence of several mutations in orf1a/b, spike, orf8, and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7. Molecular models of spike and orf8 proteins were constructed by homology modeling. Superimposition between the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2/Wuhan and SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7 showed noticeable variations in the spatial orientation in Val70-Asn74 and Thr250-Ser255 regions. This may have also resulted in the extension of the epitopic region at Ser244-Gly249 in the SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7 spike protein. Superimposition of the SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7 spike protein over Fab-spike protein complexes of SARS-CoV-2/Wuhan also showed subtle variations in the antibody binding affinity targeting the N-terminal domain of the spike protein. Epitopic variations were also observed between the corresponding orf8 regions of SARS-CoV-2/Wuhan and SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7. Moreover, the presence of a stop codon at position 27 in orf8 connotes the emergence of two frames (orf8a and orf8b) in SARS-CoV-2, which further hampers its extracellular secretion, and in turn, immunogenicity. The findings of the present study could further be used to develop targeted immunotherapeutics.","Hussain, Mushtaq; Shabbir, Sanya; Amanullah, Anusha; Raza, Fozia; Imdad, Muhammad J; Zahid, Sahar",J Med Virol,305,8

These actions have led to a national outcry by individuals and organizations (in particular Black Lives Matter (BLM)) that are fed up with the inequity that exists in society. Unlike prior movements, BLM in its current form has gained a powerful ally in members of professional sports, in particular the NBA and the WNBA. While sport figures have protested administrative failures before, this new wave of athletes have been able to capitalize on their positions and gain the support of their respective associations. In this dialogue, we explore the emergence of the Black American athlete as a key group in creating change within the administrative state, highlighted by the actions of LeBron James and Maya Moore as well as organizational support from both the NBA and the WNBA to combat social injustice across several settings. Finally, we assert that athletes play a powerful role in pushing forward the conversation around institutional and systemic racism in society.

The typical medication discovery strategy requires several years of rigorous research and development as well as a significant financial commitment, which is not feasible in the face of the current epidemic. Through molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies, we used the FDA-approved drug mezonavir against the most important viral targets, including spike (S) glycoprotein, Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Main protease (Mpro), human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), and furin. These targets are critical for viral replication and infection propagation because they play a key role in replication/transcription and host cell recognition. Molecular docking revealed that the antiviral medication mozenavir showed a stronger affinity for SARS-CoV-2 target proteins than reference medicines in this investigation. We discovered that mozenavir increases the complex's stability and validates the molecular docking findings using molecular dynamics modelling. Furin, a target protein of COVID-19, has a greater binding affinity (-12.04 kcal/mol) than other COVID-19 target proteins, forming different hydrogen bonds and polar and hydrophobic interactions, suggesting that it might be used as an antiviral treatment against SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the present in silico results will be valuable in identifying crucial targets for subsequent experimental investigations that might help combat COVID-19 by blocking the protease furin's proteolytic activity.","Mamidalaa, Estari; Davella, Rakesh; Gurrapu, Swapna; Kumar, Munipally Praveen; Abhiav,",,305,1

Here, we developed an RNA-based graphene biosensor system [RNA nano-graphene oxide system (RANGO)] to enable the fluorescence-based quantitative analysis of the RdRp enzyme activity. We used the RANGO system to a high-throughput chemical screening to identify novel direct-acting antiviral drug candidates targeting DV RdRp from the FDA-approved small-molecule library.

The repertoire of effective therapies for severe courses of the disease has remained limited. A large proportion of the world population suffers from vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, with prevalence being particularly high among the COVID-19 high-risk populations. Vitamin D supplementation has been suggested as a potential option to prevent COVID-19 infections, severe courses, and deaths from the disease, but is not widely practiced. This article provides an up-to-date summary of recent epidemiological and intervention studies on a possible role of vitamin D supplementation for preventing severe COVID-19 cases and deaths. Despite limitations and remaining uncertainties, accumulating evidence strongly supports widespread vitamin D supplementation, in particular of high-risk populations, as well as high-dose supplementation of those infected. Given the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefit-risk ratio of such supplementation calls for immediate action even before results of ongoing large-scale randomized trials become available.","Brenner, Hermann",Nutrients,305,24

As COVID-19 progressed and the first wave diminished (relatively speaking depending on the jurisdiction), more opportunities presented for making explicit choices between COVID and non-COVID patients. Then, as the second wave surged, again decision makers were more constrained even as more information and greater understanding developed. Moving out of the pandemic to recovery, choice making becomes paramount as there are no set rules to lean back into historical patterns of resource allocation.

As the COVID-19 disease is breaking out across the world, hospital-related transmission is one of the main factors accountable for the spread of COVID-19. For COVID-19 prevention it is urgent to establish a fast and efficient screening strategy for the COVID-19 patients. We analyzed 335 patients (including 124 patients with COVID-19). Five significant clinical attributes were selected as the components for establishing a COVID-19 risk score system, and every attribute was assigned a specific score according to their respective odds ratio values. We also compared three different screening schemes (Scheme I: temperature higher than 37.2 °C on admission, Scheme II: exposure to a source of transmission within 14 days in addition to fever, Scheme III: our new COVID-19 risk score) in terms of their respective receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, so as to evaluate their respective screening effectiveness. Five significant risk factors, which were exposed to a source of transmission (9 points), cluster onset (6 points), history of fever or temperature higher than 37.2 °C on admission (4 points), cough (1 point) and other atypical symptoms (1 point), were ultimately selected from many candidates to construct the new rapid COVID-19 screening program. Based on the screening scheme, the patients were quickly divided into three subgroups according to their respective COVID-19 risk scores: low risk (&#8804; 6 points, risk < 10%), medium risk (7-13 points) and high risk (&#8805; 14 points, risk > 80%). When the score of 10 points was selected as a cut-off point for differentiating the patients with COVID-19 from all of the other patients, the sensitivity was 93.6%, with a specificity of 86.3%. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of COVID-19 risk score system was 0.96 (P = 0.000), much higher than the AUCs of Scheme I (0.56, P = 0.000) and Scheme II (0.85, P = 0.000), respectively. Our COVID-19 risk score system can help the clinicians effectively and rapidly identify and differentiate the patients with COVID-19 infections, to be mainly used in those areas where COVID-19 still exhibits epidemiological characteristics.","Chen, Ru; Xu, Guilan; Yang, Lihui; Deng, Zelin; Hu, Qing; Hu, Hao; Wang, Zhen",Intern. emerg. med,305,18

(2) Methods: a three-phase time series model was fitted for 35 European countries, predicting deaths based on SARS-CoV-2 incidences. Hierarchical clustering resulted in three clusters of countries. A multiple regression model was developed predicting thresholds for COVID-19 incidences, coupled to death numbers. (3) Results: The model showed strongly connected deaths and incidences during the waves in spring and fall. The corrected case-fatality rates ranged from 2% to 20.7% in the first wave, and from 0.5% to 4.2% in the second wave. If the incidences stay below a threshold, predicted by the regression model (R2=85.0%), COVID-19 related deaths and incidences were not necessarily coupled. The clusters represented different regions in Europe, and the corrected case-fatality rates in each cluster flipped from high to low or vice versa. Severely and less severely affected countries flipped between the first and second wave.

Daily intranasal administration to ferrets completely prevented SARS-CoV-2 direct-contact transmission during 24-hour cohousing with infected animals, under stringent conditions that resulted in infection of 100% of untreated animals.

Moreover, most otolaryngological procedures, including oropharyngoscopy, generate droplets or aerosols from high viral shedding areas [1]. Thus, only non-deferrable consultations were performed in the outbreak's acute phase. Along with the re-opening of elective clinical services and the impending second wave of the outbreak, a reorganization is necessary to minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission [1]. METHODS: This video (Video 1) shows how to safely conduct an outpatient Otorhinolaryngological consultation, focusing on complete ear, nose and throat examination, according to evidences from the published literature and Otolaryngological societies guidelines [2,3]. RESULTS: After telephonic screening, patients reporting Covid-19 symptoms or closecontact with a Covid-19 case within the last 14 days are referred to telehealth services [1-3]. To avoid crowding, the patient is admitted alone, after body temperature control, except for underage or disabled people [1]. The waiting room assessment must guarantee a social distance of 6 ft [1-3]. The consultation room is reorganized into two separate areas (Fig. 1): 1) a clean desk area, where an assistant wearing a surgical mask and gloves, handles the patient's documentation and writes the medical report, keeping proper distance from the patient, and 2) a separate consultation area, where the examiner, equipped with proper personal protective equipment (Fig. 2) [3,4], carries out the medical interview and physical examination. Endoscopic-assisted ear, nose and throat inspection using a dedicated monitor allows the examiner to maintain an adequate distance from the patient throughout the procedure while providing an optimal view (Figs. 3-6) [3]. Recent evidence shows that nasal endoscopy does not increase droplet production compared to traditional otolaryngological examination [5]. When necessary, nasal topic decongestion and anesthesia must be performed using cottonoids rather than sprays [3]. The patient keeps the nose and mouth covered throughout the consultation, lowering the surgical mask on the mouth for nasal endoscopy and removing it only for oropharyngoscopy. After the consultation, the doffing procedure must be carried out carefully to avoid contamination [4]. All the equipment and surfaces must undergo high-level disinfection with 70% alcohol or 0.1% bleach solutions [3]. Proper room ventilation must precede the next consultation [3]. CONCLUSIONS: The hints provided in this video are useful to ensure both patient and examiner safety during Otolaryngological outpatient consultations and to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Arosio, Alberto Daniele; Russo, Federico; Coden, Elisa; Castelnuovo, Paolo; Volpi, Luca; Karligkiotis, Apostolos",Am J Otolaryngol,305,1

The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures proposed over the recent years for medical image classification. Specifically, the procedure called Transfer Learning was adopted. With transfer learning, the detection of various abnormalities in small medical image datasets is an achievable target, often yielding remarkable results. The datasets utilized in this experiment are two. Firstly, a collection of 1427 X-ray images including 224 images with confirmed Covid-19 disease, 700 images with confirmed common bacterial pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions. Secondly, a dataset including 224 images with confirmed Covid-19 disease, 714 images with confirmed bacterial and viral pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions.

The major effect on health-care workers and the vulnerable populations they serve has been of particular concern. Near-complete lockdown has been a common strategy to reduce the spread of the pandemic in environments such as live-in care facilities. Robotics is a promising area of research that can assist in reducing the spread of covid-19, while also preventing the need for complete physical isolation. The research presented in this paper demonstrates a speech-controlled, self-sanitizing robot that enables the delivery of items from a visitor to a resident of a care facility. The system is automated to reduce the burden on facility staff, and it is controlled entirely through hands-free audio interaction in order to reduce transmission of the virus. We demonstrate an end-to-end delivery test, and an in-depth evaluation of the speech interface. We also recorded a speech dataset with two conditions: the talker wearing a face mask and the talker not wearing a face mask. We then used this dataset to evaluate the speech recognition system. This enabled us to test the effect of face masks on speech recognition interfaces in the context of autonomous systems.","Grasse, L.; Boutros, S. J.; Tata, M. S.",Front Robot AI,305,23

However, the onerous data requirements of meta-training compounded with the challenge of learning from sensory inputs such as images have made meta-RL challenging to apply to real robotic systems. Latent state models, which learn compact state representations from a sequence of observations, can accelerate representation learning from visual inputs. In this paper, we leverage the perspective of meta-learning as task inference to show that latent state models can \emph{also} perform meta-learning given an appropriately defined observation space. Building on this insight, we develop meta-RL with latent dynamics (MELD), an algorithm for meta-RL from images that performs inference in a latent state model to quickly acquire new skills given observations and rewards. MELD outperforms prior meta-RL methods on several simulated image-based robotic control problems, and enables a real WidowX robotic arm to insert an Ethernet cable into new locations given a sparse task completion signal after only $8$ hours of real world meta-training. To our knowledge, MELD is the first meta-RL algorithm trained in a real-world robotic control setting from images.","Zhao, Tony Z.; Nagabandi, Anusha; Rakelly, Kate; Finn, Chelsea; Levine, Sergey",,305,22

The aim of this study was to assess feasibility and acceptability of a newly developed, manualized single-session CCC intervention delivered face-to-face with service users in acute and crisis psychology services in South London. The study adopted a within-subjects pre-post-test design. Participants (N = 23) were recruited from five acute psychiatric wards and a crisis resolution home treatment team. Service users had a range of diagnoses of complex and severe mental health conditions, in particular mood, personality, and psychotic disorders. Feasibility data were gathered for number of times the CCC formulation was accepted, duration of CCC intervention, clinician adherence to manualised protocol, and frequency of goal-based activity completion. Acceptability data on pre- and post-CCC mood and post-CCC helpfulness were self-reported by participants. Findings indicated a significant increase in positive mood (large effect) and moderate-high helpfulness rating postintervention. Most participants reported goal-based activity completion. There was high fidelity to the protocol, high percentage of acceptance of the formulation and formulation components completed, and frequent single-session completion. Single-session CCC appears feasible and acceptable in acute and crisis psychology services and yields formulation-driven goal-based activities intended to stabilize mental health crisis. High fidelity to formulation protocol suggests broader applications for single-session CCC, for example, to support clinical staff to manage crisis situations in their work environment or to train nonpsychologist clinicians to deliver the intervention for service users. A randomized controlled trial of single-session CCC would increase validity and generalisability of findings.","Bullock, Jonathan; Whiteley, Christopher; Moakes, Kaylee; Clarke, Isabel; Riches, Simon",,305,27

Our main idea is to treat images as functional measurements and exploit underlying covariance structures to select basis functions; these bases are then used in approximating both image profiles and corresponding regression coefficient. We re-express the regression model into a standard generalized linear model where the functional principal component scores are treated as covariates. We apply the method to (1) classify pneumonia against healthy and viral against bacterial pneumonia patients, and (2) test the null effect about the association between images and responses.

In SARS-CoV-2 infection, the host immune response is thought to play a key role in the pathophysiological effects of lung damage. Therefore, corticosteroid therapy could modulate inflammation-mediated pulmonary injury and thereby reduce progression to severe respiratory failure and death. The aim of this study was to analyse the safety and clinical efficacy of corticosteroid therapy in older adults with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHOD: We reviewed the clinical records of confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 75 years or older admitted to our hospital over a three months period (March 1, to May 31, 2020). A total of 143 patients were included in the study cohort. From 2 April, 2020, in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on COVID-19, our hospital protocol added corticosteroid for COVID-19 treatment. We compared in-hospital mortality among patients with critical COVID-19 who received corticosteroids therapy and those who did not. RESULTS: 88 patients (61.5%) were treated with corticosteroids, and 55 patients (38.4%) were not. Both groups were similar in baseline characteristics. The median age was 85 years (IQR, 82-89), and 61.5% (88/143) were male. In-hospital mortality was lower in the corticosteroid group (68.2%) compared with patients in the non-corticosteroid group (81.8%). Treatment with corticosteroids was an independent survival factor (HR=0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.93; P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill older adults with COVID-19 pneumonia, the use of corticosteroid treatment resulted in lower mortality without severe adverse events.","Piniella-Ruiz, Esther; Bellver-Álvarez, María Teresa; Mestre-Gómez, Beatriz; Escolano-Fernández, Belén; Vinat-Prado, Sara; Cabezas-Olea, Rita; Acedo-Gutiérrez, María Soledad; Akasbi-Montalvo, Mirian; Ryan-Murua, Pablo; Bustamante-Fermosel, Ana; Muñoz-Rivas, Nuria; Santamaría-García, Carmen; Pardo-Guimerá, Virginia; Ulla-Anés, Mariano; Franco-Moreno, Anabel; Torres-Macho, Juna","J. gerontol.

This study aims to describe readmission rate within 14 days of patients with COVID-19 discharged from ED and to identify predictors of return hospital admission. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with COVID-19 discharged from two EDs. Return hospital admission was defined as an unscheduled return ED visit within 14 days after initial ED evaluation and discharge. We compared the group of patients who had a return hospital admission to those who did not. We also evaluated selected clinical characteristics (age, neutrophilia, SOFA, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein and D-dimer) associated with return hospital admission. RESULTS: Of 283 patients included in the study, 65 (22.9%) had a return ED visit within 14 days. 32 of those patients (11%) were then hospitalized, while the remaining 33 were again discharged. Patients requiring a return hospital admission was significantly older, had higher pro-calcitonin and D-dimer levels. Major predictors of return hospital admission were cognitive impairment (OR 17.3 [CI 4.7-63.2]), P/F < 300 mmHg (OR 8.6 [CI 1.6-44.3]), being resident in geriatric care facility (OR 7.6 [CI 2.1-26.4]) and neutrophilia (OR 5.8 [CI 1.6-22.0]). CONCLUSION: Several factors are associated with 14-day return hospital admission in COVID-19 subjects. These should be considered when assessing discharge risk in ED clinical practice.","Menditto, Vincenzo G; Fulgenzi, Francesca; Bonifazi, Martina; Gnudi, Umberto; Gennarini, Silvia; Mei, Federico; Salvi, Aldo",Am J Emerg Med,305,20

Our results show that almost half of the volatility of changes in total inflation is explained by changes in oil price. As could be expected, the energy component of inflation drives this effect.

While most GIS work on Covid-19 testing coverage and access has used census tract or ZIP code aggregated data, this manuscript is unique in that it uses individual level demographics and exact addresses to calculate distances actually traveled by patients. METHODS: We used testing data recorded for 9721 patients at 20 sites operating in May-June 2020. The dataset includes detailed age, race and ethnicity, and testing results as well as the exact address of each individual. Using GIS, we estimated changes in testing coverage for minority neighborhoods and calculated the actual distance covered by individuals. Logistic regression and multivariate linear regression were used to identify socio-demographic variables associated with distance travelled to and used of nearest testing site. We used a secondary dataset from drive-through sites to evaluate change in coverage at the census tract level for the metropolitan area. RESULTS: Walk-up sites significantly increased testing availability in New Orleans, and specifically in minority neighborhoods. Both African Americans and Asians were more likely (14.7 and 53.0%) to be tested at the nearest walk-up site. They also covered shorter distances to get tested. Being elderly was also significantly and positively associated with testing at the nearest site. Hispanics, however, were not associated with increased proximity to and use of nearest sites, and they traveled an additional 0.745 km to get tested. Individuals who tested positive also travelled significantly longer distances to obtain a test. CONCLUSIONS: Walk-up sites increased testing availability for some vulnerable populations who took advantage of the sites' proximity, although inequalities appear at the metropolitan scale. As cities are planning community vaccination campaigns, mobile, walk-up sites appear to improve both coverage and accessibility for hard-to-reach populations. With adequate technical (vaccine dose refrigeration) and messaging (addressing reticence to immunization) adaptations, they could constitute a key complementary approach to health facility points of delivery.","Hernandez, Julie H; Karletsos, Dimitris; Avegno, Jennifer; Reed, Chantell H",BMC Public Health,305,1

Immunization can cause transient inflammation thereby causing increased metabolic activity at injection site and hypermetabolic lymph nodes. Various vaccinations and local injections have been known to cause diagnostic dilemma due to false-positive uptake on FDG PET-CT. In this pictorial case review, we present five cases demonstrating various patterns of uptake including an ipsilateral deltoid muscle, axillary, supraclavicular, and subpectoral lymph nodes post COVID-19 vaccination. A careful history of COVID-19 vaccination and normal size and morphology of lymph node on unenhanced low-dose CT will aid the diagnosis. All patients undergoing FDG PET-CT will require detailed documentation of the vaccination history including the time interval since vaccination. Knowledge about these patterns of uptake on PET-CT will ensure accurate interpretation by Nuclear Medicine physicians and radiologists during the current vaccination drive.","Shah, S.; Wagner, T.; Nathan, M.; Szyszko, T.",Bjr Case Reports,305,16

It has furthermore been suggested that less-developed countries are particularly affected by this pandemic. Empirical evidence for this is lacking. METHODS: Based on a dataset covering 170 countries, patterns of empirical 7-d reproductive ratios during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic were analysed. Time trends and associations with socio-economic development indicators, such as gross domestic product per capita, physicians per population, extreme poverty prevalence and maternal mortality ratio, were analysed in mixed linear regression models using log-transformed reproductive ratios as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Reproductive ratios during the early phase of a pandemic exhibited high fluctuations and overall strong declines. Stable estimates were observed only several weeks into the pandemic, with a median reproductive ratio of 0.96 (interquartile range 0.72-1.34) 6 weeks into the analysis period. Unfavourable socio-economic indicators showed consistent associations with higher reproductive ratios, which were elevated by a factor of 1.29 (95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.46), for example, in the countries in the highest compared with the lowest tertile of extreme poverty prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has allowed for the first time description of the global patterns of reproductive ratios of a novel pathogen during pandemic spread. The present study reports the first quantitative empirical evidence that COVID-19 net transmissibility remains less controlled in socio-economically disadvantaged countries, even months into the pandemic. This needs to be addressed by the global scientific community as well as international politics.","Breitling, Lutz P",International health (Online),305,9

Here, we report field effect transistors (FETs) with stacked transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) channels, where the heterojunction interface between two TMDs appears useful for nonvolatile or neuromorphic memory FETs. A few nanometer-thin WSe2 and MoTe2 flakes are vertically stacked on the gate dielectric, and bottom p-MoTe2 performs as a channel for hole transport. Interestingly, the WSe2/MoTe2 stack interface functions as a hole trapping site where traps behave in a nonvolatile manner, although trapping/detrapping can be controlled by gate voltage (VGS). Memory retention after high VGS pulse appears longer than 10000 s, and the Program/Erase ratio in a drain current is higher than 200. Moreover, the traps are delicately controllable even with small VGS, which indicates that a neuromorphic memory is also possible with our heterojunction stack FETs. Our stack channel FET demonstrates neuromorphic memory behavior of â¼94% recognition accuracy.","Park, Sam; Jeong, Yeonsu; Jin, Hye-Jin; Park, Junkyu; Jang, Hyenam; Lee, Sol; Huh, Woong; Cho, Hyunmin; Shin, Hyung Gon; Kim, Kwanpyo; Lee, Chul-Ho; Choi, Shinhyun; Im, Seongil",ACS nano,305,16

METHODS: Cancer patient who required treatment, were evaluated for potential COVID-19 infection in a 90-day period, starting from beginning of this epidemic in Iran, January, to April 19, 2020. For treatment of solid tumor patients, if they did not have symptoms related to COVID-19, just chest X-ray was requested. If they showed COVID-19 related symptoms, high resolution CT scan of lungs was requested. For hematology cancer patients, PCR test for COVID-19 infection was requested as well. Protection measures were considered for personnel of oncology wards. RESULTS: 279 Patients were followed up in this 90-day period. No COVID-19 infection was observed in 92 cases of breast cancer, 14 cases of gastric cancer and 12 cases of pancreaticobiliary cancer. However, in 72 cases of colon cancer, 11 cases of lung cancer, 5 cases brain tumors and 12 cases ovarian cancer; 4 cases of COVID-19 were observed. In the hematology cancers group, which included 14 cases of Hodgkin's disease, 23 cases of lymphoproliferative disorder, 12 cases of acute leukemia and 12 cases of multiple myeloma; 3 cases of COVID-19 were observed. CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer who need treatment can be treated by taking some measures. These measures include observing individual and collective protection principles in patients and health-care personnel, increasing patients' awareness particularly about self-care behavior, performing a COVID-19 test, and taking a chest X-ray, before the treatment starts.","Aznab, Mozaffar",Int J Clin Oncol,305,21

Design: Cross-sectional survey study. Setting: Four University hospitals in Italy. Participants: HCPs working in obstetrics, including gynecologists, residents in gynecology and obstetrics, and midwives. Methods: The 104-item survey Impatto PSIcologico COVID-19 in Ostetricia (IPSICO) was created by a multidisciplinary expert panel and administered to HCPs in obstetrics in May 2020 via a web-based platform. Main Outcome Measures: Psychological distress assessed by the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) included in the IPSICO survey. Results: The response rate to the IPSICO survey was 88.2% (503/570), and that for GHQ-12 was 84.4% (481/570).

This contribution presents a data-driven methodology that allows exploring the hospitalization dynamics of COVID-19, exemplified with a study of 17 autonomous regions in Spain. MethodsWe use data on new daily cases and hospitalizations reported by the Ministry of Health of Spain to implement a Bayesian inference method that allows making short and mid-term predictions of bed occupancy of COVID-19 patients in each of the autonomous regions of the country. FindingsWe show how to use given and generated temporal series for the number of daily admissions and discharges from hospital to reproduce the hospitalization dynamics of COVID-19 patients. For the case-study of the region of Aragon, we estimate that the probability of being admitted to hospital care upon infection is 0{middle dot}090 [0{middle dot}086-0{middle dot}094], (95% C.I.), with the distribution governing hospital admission yielding a median interval of 3{middle dot}5 days and an IQR of 7 days. Likewise, the distribution on the length of stay produces estimates of 12 days for the median and 10 days for the IQR. A comparison between model parameters for the regions analyzed allows to detect differences and changes in policies of the health authorities. InterpretationThe amount of data that is currently available is limited, and sometimes unreliable, hindering our understanding of many aspects of this pandemic. We have observed important regional differences, signaling that to properly compare very different populations, it is paramount to acknowledge all the diversity in terms of culture, socio-economic status and resource availability.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of children and adolescents with suspected Idiopathic Torsional Deformities (ITD) and pain, gait function, activity and participation. METHODS: A retrospective review of all children and adolescents who attended our Centre over a 5-year period for evaluation of the effect of ITD. All children completed three-dimensional gait analysis (3DGA), standardized physical examination, medical imaging and the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI). Statistical analysis was completed using two sample t-tests, Pearson's Correlation and linear regression. RESULTS: Fifty children and adolescents, 40 females and 10 males with a mean age of 13.5 years were included. Children reported a high prevalence of pain(86%), had increased internal hip rotation(p = 0.002) and decreased external hip rotation(p < 0.001) on physical examination when compared to published normative data. Medical imaging showed a mean(SD) femoral neck anteversion (FNA) of 38°(13°) and external tibial torsion of 39°(12°). Mean(SD) PODCI score was 32(16), indicating these children are functioning below their typically developing peers. The 3DGA kinematics show deviations from typical data including hip rotation, foot progression, pelvic tilt, hip flexion and knee extension. Observed mild kinetic deviations were within typical limits. The relationship between FNA and gait parameters, FNA and PODCI and gait and PODCI were weak. SIGNIFICANCE: These children and adolescents have altered gait and experience pain leading to impaired function and diminished participation. Therefore, ITD is not purely a cosmetic issue.","Mackay, Jessie; Thomason, Pam; Sangeux, Morgan; Passmore, Elyse; Francis, Kate; Graham, H Kerr",Gait Posture,305,16

Multiplex immunoblot (IB) assays termed COVID-19 IB assays were developed for detecting IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Recombinant nucleocapsid protein and the S1, S2 and receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were used as target antigens in the COVID-19 IBs. Specificity of the IB assay was established with 231 sera from persons with allergy, unrelated viral infections, autoimmune conditions and suspected tick-borne diseases, and 32 goat antisera to human influenza proteins. IgG and IgM COVID-19 IBs assays were performed on 84 sera obtained at different times after a positive RT-qPCR test from 37 COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. RESULTS: Criteria for determining overall IgG and IgM antibody positivity using the four SARS-CoV-2 proteins were developed by optimizing specificity and sensitivity in the COVID-19 IgG and IgM IB assays. The estimated sensitivities and specificities of the COVID-19 IgG and IgM IBs for IgG and IgM antibodies individually or for either IgG or IgM antibodies meet the US recommendations for laboratory serological diagnostic tests. The proportion of IgM-positive sera from the COVID-19 patients following an RT-qPCR positive test was maximal at 83% before 10 days and decreased to 0% after 100 days, while the proportions of IgG-positive sera tended to plateau between days 11 and 65 at 78-100% and fall to 44% after 100 days. Detection of either IgG or IgM antibodies was better than IgG or IgM alone for assessing seroconversion in COVID-19. Both IgG and IgM antibodies detected RBD less frequently than S1, S2 and N proteins.

This study aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the detection and management of colorectal cancer in England. METHODS: Data were extracted from four population-based datasets spanning NHS England (the National Cancer Cancer Waiting Time Monitoring, Monthly Diagnostic, Secondary Uses Service Admitted Patient Care and the National Radiotherapy datasets) for all referrals, colonoscopies, surgical procedures, and courses of rectal radiotherapy from Jan 1, 2019, to Oct 31, 2020, related to colorectal cancer in England. Differences in patterns of care were investigated between 2019 and 2020. Percentage reductions in monthly numbers and proportions were calculated. FINDINGS: As compared to the monthly average in 2019, in April, 2020, there was a 63% (95% CI 53-71) reduction (from 36â274 to 13â440) in the monthly number of 2-week referrals for suspected cancer and a 92% (95% CI 89-95) reduction in the number of colonoscopies (from 46â441 to 3484). Numbers had just recovered by October, 2020. This resulted in a 22% (95% CI 8-34) relative reduction in the number of cases referred for treatment (from a monthly average of 2781 in 2019 to 2158 referrals in April, 2020). By October, 2020, the monthly rate had returned to 2019 levels but did not exceed it, suggesting that, from April to October, 2020, over 3500 fewer people had been diagnosed and treated for colorectal cancer in England than would have been expected. There was also a 31% (95% CI 19-42) relative reduction in the numbers receiving surgery in April, 2020, and a lower proportion of laparoscopic and a greater proportion of stoma-forming procedures, relative to the monthly average in 2019. By October, 2020, laparoscopic surgery and stoma rates were similar to 2019 levels. For rectal cancer, there was a 44% (95% CI 17-76) relative increase in the use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy in April, 2020, relative to the monthly average in 2019, due to greater use of short-course regimens. Although in June, 2020, there was a drop in the use of short-course regimens, rates remained above 2019 levels until October, 2020. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sustained reduction in the number of people referred, diagnosed, and treated for colorectal cancer. By October, 2020, achievement of care pathway targets had returned to 2019 levels, albeit with smaller volumes of patients and with modifications to usual practice. As pressure grows in the NHS due to the second wave of COVID-19, urgent action is needed to address the growing burden of undetected and untreated colorectal cancer in England.

It has already infected more than 54.5 million people worldwide, currently leading to more than 1.3 million deaths. Although it causes a mild flu-like disease in most patients, lethality may increase to more than 20% in elderly subjects, especially in those with comorbidities, like hypertension, diabetes, or lung and cardiac disease, and the mechanisms are still elusive. Common symptoms at the onset of illness are fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue, headache, and diarrhea or constipation. Interestingly, respiratory viruses have also placed themselves as relevant agents for central nervous system (CNS) pathologies. Conversely, SARS-CoV-2 has already been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. Here, we discuss several clinical features related to CNS infection during COVID-19. Patients may progress from headaches and migraines to encephalitis, stroke, and seizures with leptomeningitis. However, the pathway used by the virus to reach the brain is still unknown. It may infect the olfactory bulb by retrograde neuronal transportation from olfactory epithelium, or it could be transported by the blood. Either way, neurological complications of COVID-19 add greatly to the complex pathophysiology of the disease. Neurological signs and symptoms must alert physicians not only to worst outcomes but also to future possible degenerative diseases.","Bandeira, Isabelle Pastor; Schlindwein, Marco Antônio Machado; Breis, Leticia Caroline; Peron, Jean Pierre Schatzmann; Gonçalves, Marcus Vinícius Magno",Adv Exp Med Biol,305,16

In this article, we report the case of a 75-year-old female with a baseline prolonged QT interval in whom the COVID-19 illness resulted in further remarkable QT prolongation (>700 ms), precipitating recurrent self-terminating episodes of torsade de pointes that necessitated temporary cardiac pacing. Despite the correction of hypoxemia and the absence of reversible factors, such as adverse medication effects, electrolyte derangements, and usage of hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, the QT interval remained persistently prolonged compared with the baseline with subsequent degeneration into ventricular tachycardia and death. Thus, we highlight that COVID-19 illness itself can potentially lead to further prolongation of QT interval and unmask fatal ventricular arrhythmias in patients who have a prolonged QT and low repolarization reserve at baseline.","Anupama, B K; Adhikari, Soumya; Chaudhuri, Debanik",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,305,24

These restrictions may be particularly difficult for adolescents, who rely heavily on their peer connections for emotional support. However, there has been no longitudinal research examining the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among adolescents. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' mental health, and moderators of change, as well as assessing the factors perceived as causing the most distress. Two hundred and forty eight adolescents (Mage = 14.4; 51% girls; 81.8% Caucasian) were surveyed over two time points; in the 12 months leading up to the COVID-19 outbreak (T1), and again two months following the implementation of government restrictions and online learning (T2). Online surveys assessed depressive symptoms, anxiety, and life satisfaction at T1 and T2, and participants' schooling, peer and family relationships, social connection, media exposure, COVID-19 related stress, and adherence to government stay-at-home directives at T2 only. In line with predictions, adolescents experienced significant increases in depressive symptoms and anxiety, and a significant decrease in life satisfaction from T1 to T2, which was particularly pronounced among girls. Moderation analyses revealed that COVID-19 related worries, online learning difficulties, and increased conflict with parents predicted increases in mental health problems from T1 to T2, whereas adherence to stay-at-home orders and feeling socially connected during the COVID-19 lockdown protected against poor mental health. This study provides initial longitudinal evidence for the decline of adolescent's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results suggest that adolescents are more concerned about the government restrictions designed to contain the spread of the virus, than the virus itself, and that those concerns are associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and decreased life satisfaction.","Magson, Natasha R; Freeman, Justin Y A; Rapee, Ronald M; Richardson, Cele E; Oar, Ella L; Fardouly, Jasmine",J. youth adolesc,305,16

It had caused the onset of small disease outbreaks in China, and probably elsewhere as well, which failed to reach epidemic potential. The distant general origin of its zoonosis can be traced back to the ecosystem changes that have decreased biodiversity, greatly facilitating the contacts between humans and the animal reservoirs that carry pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. These reservoirs are the bats. The transition between the limited outbreaks that had occurred through 2019 and the epidemic explosion of December-January was made possible by the great amplification of the general negative conditions that had caused the preceding small outbreaks. In the light of what we have now learned, the explosion was predictable, and could have happened wherever the conditions that had allowed it, could be duplicated. What could not have been predicted was the second transition, from epidemic to pandemic. Research has now revealed that the globalization of the infection appears to have been caused by a mutation in the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2, that has dramatically increased its transmissibility.","Platto, Sara; Wang, Yanqing; Zhou, Jinfeng; Carafoli, Ernesto",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,305,16

The advent of social distancing as essential for decreasing viral transmission has made it challenging to provide medical care. Telemedicine has the potential to medically undistance health care providers while maintaining the quality of care delivered and fulfilling the goal of social distancing. Methods: Rather than simply reporting enterprise telemedicine successes, the authors detail key telemedicine elements essential for rapid deployment of both an ambulatory and inpatient telemedicine solution. Such a deployment requires a multifaceted strategy: (1) determining the appropriateness of telemedicine use, (2) understanding the interface with the electronic health record, (3) knowing the equipment and resources needed, (4) developing a rapid rollout plan, (5) establishing a command center for post go-live support, (6) creating and disseminating reference materials and educational guides, (7) training clinicians, patients, and clinic schedulers, (8) considering billing and credentialing implications, (9) building a robust communications strategy, and (10) measuring key outcomes. Results: Initial results are reported, showing a telemedicine rate increase to 45.8% (58.6% video and telephone) in just the first week of rollout. Over a 5-month period, the enterprise has since conducted over 119,500 ambulatory telemedicine evaluations (a 1,000-fold rate increase from the pre-COVID-19 time period).

We describe the rationale, aims, and design for a new study, ""A SMART Approach to Treating Tobacco Use Disorder in Persons with HIV (SMARTTT),"" a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial. METHODS: In HIV clinics within three health systems in the northeastern United States, PWH with tobacco use disorder are randomized to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) with or without contingency management (NRT vs. NRTâ¯+â¯CM). Participants with response (defined as exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO)-confirmed smoking abstinence at week 12), continue the same treatment for another 12â¯weeks. Participants with non-response, are re-randomized to either switch medications from NRT to varenicline or intensify treatment to a higher CM reward schedule. Interventions are delivered by clinical pharmacists embedded in HIV clinics. The primary outcome is eCO-confirmed smoking abstinence; secondary outcomes include CD4 cell count, HIV viral load suppression, and the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) Index 2.0 score (a validated measure of morbidity and mortality based on laboratory data). Consistent with a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation design and grounded in implementation science frameworks, we will conduct an implementation-focused process evaluation in parallel. Study protocol adaptations related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been made. CONCLUSIONS: SMARTTT is expected to generate novel findings regarding the impact, cost, and implementation of an adaptive clinical pharmacist-delivered intervention involving medications and CM to promote smoking abstinence among PWH.

Although typical GCN models focus on classifying nodes within a static graph, several recent variants propose node classification in dynamic graphs whose topologies and node attributes change over time, e.g., social networks with dynamic relationships, or literature citation networks with changing co-authorships. These works, however, do not fully address the challenge of flexibly assigning different importance to snapshots of the graph at different times, which depending on the graph dynamics may have more or less predictive power on the labels. We address this challenge by proposing a new method, GCN-SE, that attaches a set of learnable attention weights to graph snapshots at different times, inspired by Squeeze and Excitation Net (SE-Net). We show that GCN-SE outperforms previously proposed node classification methods on a variety of graph datasets. To verify the effectiveness of the attention weight in determining the importance of different graph snapshots, we adapt perturbation-based methods from the field of explainable machine learning to graphical settings and evaluate the correlation between the attention weights learned by GCN-SE and the importance of different snapshots over time. These experiments demonstrate that GCN-SE can in fact identify different snapshots' predictive power for dynamic node classification.","Fan, Yucai; Yao, Yuhang; Joe-Wong, Carlee",,305,30

The negative health outcomes for the COVID-19 infection have been most severe in the frail elderly dwelling in Canadian long-term care (LTC) homes. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey of Ontario LTC Clinicians working in LTC homes in Ontario Canada was conducted to provide the clinician perspective on the preparedness and engagement of the LTC sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey questionnaire was developed in collaboration with the Ontario Long-Term Care Clinicians organization (OLTCC) and was distributed between March 30, 2020 to May 25, 2020. All registered members of the OLTCC and Nurse-led LTC Outreach Teams were invited to participate. The primary outcomes were: 1) the descriptive report of the screening measures implemented, communication and information received, and the preparation of the respondent's LTC home to a potential COVID-19 outbreak; and 2) the level of agreement, as reported using a five-point Likert scale), to COVID-19 preparedness statements for the respondent's LTC home was also assessed. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 54% (160/294). LTC homes implemented a wide range of important interventions (e.g. instituting established respiratory isolation protocols, active screening of new LTC admissions, increasing education on infection control processes, encouraging sick staff to take time off, etc). Ample communications pertinent to the pandemic were received from provincial LTC organizations, the government and public health officials. However, the feasibility of implementing public health recommendations, as well as the engagement of the LTC sector in pandemic planning were identified as areas of concern. Medical director status was associated with an increased knowledge of local implementation of interventions to mitigate COVID-19, as well as endorsing increased access to reliable COVID-19 information and resources to manage a potential COVID-19 outbreak in their LTC home. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the communication and implementation of recommendations in the Ontario LTC sector, despite some concerns regarding feasibility. Importantly, LTC clinician respondents clearly indicated that better engagement with LTC leaders is needed to plan a coordinated pandemic response.","Siu, Henry Yu-Hin; Kristof, Lorand; Elston, Dawn; Hafid, Abe; Mather, Fred",BMC Geriatr,305,8

We believe these findings may allow early identification of the patients at high risk for death, and can also assist in better management of these patients.","Wang, Jun-Hong; Chen, Ru-Dong; Yang, Hong-Kuan; Zeng, Ling-Cheng; Chen, Hao; Hou, Yu-Yang; Hu, Wei; Yu, Jia-Sheng; Li, Hua",J. med. virol,305,16

These organisations will find it challenging to have systems which can mine information from the unstructured data fields in the record (clinical notes, letters etc) and more practically have such systems interact with all of the hospitals data systems (legacy and current). To tackle this problem at University College London Hospitals, we have deployed an enhanced version of the CogStack platform; an information retrieval platform with natural language processing capabilities which we have configured to process the hospital's existing and legacy records. The platform has improved data ingestion capabilities as well as better tools for natural language processing. To date we have processed over 18 million records and the insights produced from CogStack have informed a number of clinical research use cases at the hospitals.","Noor, Kawsar; Roguski, Lukasz; Handy, Alex; Klapaukh, Roman; Folarin, Amos; Romao, Luis; Matteson, Joshua; Lea, Nathan; Zhu, Leilei; Wong, Wai Keong; Shah, Anoop; Dobson, Richard J",,305,27

METHODS: Test data for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 from national surveillance systems between 20 January 2020 and 25 April 2020 were used to estimate influenza infection on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A test-negative design was used to assess the odds of SARS-CoV-2 in those who tested positive for influenza compared with those who tested negative. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 was also assessed using univariable and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: The risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was 58% lower among influenza-positive cases and patients with a coinfection had a risk of death of 5.92 (95% confidence interval: 3.21-10.91) times greater than among those with neither influenza nor SARS-CoV-2. The odds of ventilator use or death and intensive care unit admission or death were greatest among coinfected patients.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, several antimicrobial drugs have lost their efficacy and are no longer useful to treat life-threatening infections. Since the exacerbation of antimicrobial resistance is likely to be another casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a pressing need to develop innovative strategies to minimize the risk of antimicrobial resistance. Areas covered: Focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic, I have briefly summarized the current knowledge and challenges in our understanding of antimicrobial resistance, emphasizing quorum sensing and quorum quenching. Our understanding of bacterial communication by quorum sensing to acquire virulence has paved the way to reduce bacterial pathogenicity through quorum quenching. Availability of clinically viable quorum quenching agents would likely to diminish bacterial virulence to create a microenvironment for the host phagocytic cells to reduce bacterial infection. Expert opinion: Future studies that aim to generate clinically useful quorum quenching agents need to be considered. An important benefit of such agents may be a diminished risk of antimicrobial resistance.","Razzaque, Mohammed S",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,305,1

Data are scarce on the role of rhinovirus (RV) infections in this patient group. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of RV infections in preschool asthma: (i) susceptibility factors, (ii) clinical course, and (iii) medium-term outcome. METHODS: A total of 130 asthmatic children aged 4-6 years from the multinational PreDicta cohort were prospectively followed for a 12-month period. Allergy tests and a standard health questionnaire were carried out at study entry. Respiratory virus presence in nasopharyngeal washes was studied at illness visits and at 3 scheduled visits. RESULTS: At study entry, mean age of the children was 5.3 years. Of 571 visits, 54% were positive for any virus and 39% for RV. Patient characteristics were only assessed with RV infection due to low number of other viruses. The use of supplementary vitamin D was inversely associated with RV infection (P < .05). RV infection was associated with more severe course of acute illness in terms of more severe nighttime coughing, more sleep disturbances, and more days with runny nose (all P < .05). RV infection was also associated with more severe disease course during the 12-month follow-up in terms of more nights with awakenings and more days of exercise-related symptoms (both P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation may have an anti-rhinovirus effect. Both short- and medium-term outcomes suggest RV infection to be an important clinical marker of instable preschool asthma.","Jartti, Tuomas; Liimatainen, Unna; Xepapadaki, Paraskevi; Vahlberg, Tero; Bachert, Claus; Finotto, Susetta; Kowalski, Marek L; Sobanska, Anna; Lukkarinen, Heikki; Pasioti, Maria; Vuorinen, Tytti; Zhang, Nan; Zimmermann, Theodor; Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G",Allergy,305,16

However, the pathogenesis is unknown. METHODS: For the sake of investigating the risk factors and mechanism of PND, we collected the characteristics and neurological scores of patients undergoing cardiac surgery in the Affiliated Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital of Southwest Medical University and Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University from Jan 1, 2016 to Dec 11, 2018. RESULTS: We found that age and left atrial thrombus are independent risk factors for PND after cardiac surgery. Furthermore, the serum of 29 patients was collected on the 7th day after cardiac surgery for detecting the expression of lncRNA-MYL2-2 and miR-124-3p. Increased lncRNA-MYL2-2 and decreased miR-124-3p in serum were associated with the decline of patients' cognition. CONCLUSIONS: LncRNA-MYL2-2 and miRNA-124-3p may jointly participate in the occurrence and development of PND after cardiac surgery.

Parents argue that the schools' demands on them were unreasonable. These added to the stress of the quarantine and professional losses, and to the burden of working full-time, fulfilling household responsibilities, and having children rely mostly on parents to deliver an often brief, 'shallow' weekly lesson plan that lacked clear expectations and reliable assessment pieces.

Here, we present a combined analytical and numerical study on the generation of orientational quantum revivals (OQRs) exclusively using a single-cycle THz pulse. As a proof of principle, we examine the scheme in the linear polar molecule HCN with experimentally accessible pulse parameters and obtain strong field-free OQR without requiring the condition of the sudden-impact limit. To visualize the involved quantum mechanism, we derive a three-state model using the Magnus expansion of the time-evolution operator. Interestingly, the THz pulse interaction with the electric-dipole moment can activate direct multiphoton processes, leading to OQR enhancements beyond that induced by a rotational ladder-climbing mechanism from the rotational ground state. This work provides an explicit and feasible approach toward quantum control of molecular rotation, which is at the core of current research endeavors with potential applications in atomic and molecular physics, photochemistry, and quantum information science.","Shu, Chuan-Cun; Hong, Qian-Qian; Guo, Yu; Henriksen, Niels E.",,305,1

There is an urgent need for serological tests to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which could be used to assess past infection, evaluate responses to vaccines in development, and determine individuals who may be protected from future infection. Current serological tests developed for SARS-CoV-2 rely on traditional technologies such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and lateral flow assays, which have not scaled to meet the demand of hundreds of millions of antibody tests so far. Herein, we present an alternative method of antibody testing that depends on one protein reagent being added to patient serum/plasma or whole blood with direct, visual readout. Two novel fusion proteins, RBD-2E8 and B6-CH1-RBD, were designed to bind red blood cells (RBCs) via a single-chain variable fragment (scFv), thereby displaying the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on the surface of RBCs. Mixing mammalian-derived RBD-2E8 and B6-CH1-RBD with convalescent COVID-19 patient serum and RBCs led to visible hemagglutination, indicating the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD. B6-CH1-RBD made in bacteria was not as effective in inducing agglutination, indicating better recognition of RBD epitopes from mammalian cells. Given that our hemagglutination test uses methods routinely used in hospital clinical labs across the world for blood typing, we anticipate the test can be rapidly deployed at minimal cost. We anticipate our hemagglutination assay may find extensive use in low-resource settings for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Kruse, Robert L; Huang, Yuting; Smetana, Heather; Gehrie, Eric A; Amukele, Timothy K; Tobian, Aaron A R; Mostafa, Heba H; Wang, Zack Z",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,305,29

Scans were classified according to duration in weeks after onset of symptoms. These CT abnormalities were compared between discharged and dead patients. Twenty-six patients were discharged, whereas 21 passed away. Discharged patients were characterized by a rapid rise in CT score in the first 2 weeks followed by a slow decline, presence of reticular and mixed patterns from the second week, and prevalence of subpleural distribution of opacities in all weeks. In contrast, dead patients were characterized by a progressive rise in CT score, persistence of ground-glass opacity and consolidation patterns in all weeks, and prevalence of diffuse distribution from the second week. CT scores of death group were significantly higher than those of discharge group (P < 0.05). The CT changes differed between the discharged and dead patients. An understanding of these differences can be of clinical significance in the assessment of the prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients.","Liang, Bin; Xie, Lingli; Yang, Fan; Makamure, Joyman; Zhang, Lijie; Pang, Ran; Du, Peng; Fan, Wenhui; Zheng, Chuansheng",Sci Rep,305,11

The aim of the present manuscript is to review the main relevant mechanisms possibly contributing to worsen the clinical course of COVID-19 in T2D. RESULTS: Poor glucose control, high glycaemic variability and diabetes-related comorbidities at baseline, particularly cardiovascular diseases and obesity, contribute in worsening the prognosis in the above-mentioned cluster of patients. Moreover, both a lower efficient innate immune system response and cytokine dysregulation predispose patients with T2D to impaired viral clearance and more serious pulmonary and systemic inflammation once the SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred. Inconclusive data are currently available for specifically indicate or contraindicate concurrent medications for managing T2D and its comorbidities in infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: T2D individuals should be considered as more vulnerable to COVID-19 than general population, and thus require adequate advices about hygienic tips to protect themselves during the pandemic. A careful management of glucose levels and diabetes-related comorbidities remains essential for avoiding further complications, and patient monitoring during the pandemic should be performed also at distance by means of telemedicine. Further studies are needed to clarify whether medications normally used for managing T2D and its associated comorbidities could have a protective or detrimental effect on COVID-19 clinical course.","Lisco, Giuseppe; De Tullio, Anna; Giagulli, Vito Angelo; Guastamacchia, Edoardo; De Pergola, Giovanni; Triggiani, Vincenzo",Endocrine,305,11

The approach of traditional healthcare systems to disaster preparedness and prevention has demonstrated intrinsic problems, such as failure to detect early the spread of the virus, public hospitals being overwhelmed, a dire shortage of personal protective equipment, and exhaustion of healthcare workers. Consequently, this situation resulted in manpower and resource costs, leading to the widespread and exponential rise of infected cases at the early stage of the epidemic. To limit the spread of infection, the Chinese government adopted innovative, specialized, and advanced systems, including empowered Fangcang and Internet hospitals, as well as high technologies such as 5G, big data analysis, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The efficient use of these new forces helped China win its fight against the virus. As the rampant spread of the virus continues outside China, these new forces need to be integrated into the global healthcare system to combat the disease. Global healthcare system integrated with new forces is essential not only for COVID-19 but also for unknown infections in the future.","Sun, Shuangyi; Xie, Zhen; Yu, Keting; Jiang, Bingqian; Zheng, Siwei; Pan, Xiaoting",Global Health,305,1

Under the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic and the global economic downturn, the Chinese government quickly brought the epidemic under control and restored the positive economic growth through strong intervention. Based on the panel data of provincial level in China and the government intervention as the threshold variable, this paper empirically analyzed the non-linear effect of business cycle on population health by using the panel threshold regression model. The empirical results show that the impact of the business cycle on population health is significantly negative, and government intervention has a single threshold effect on the relationship between business cycle and population health. When the government intervention is below the threshold value, the business cycle has a significant negative effect on the improvement of the population health level; when the level of government intervention exceeds the threshold value, the relationship between business cycle and population health becomes significantly positive. To some extent, the conclusions of this paper can guide the formulation and revision of government health policy and help to adjust the direction and intensity of government intervention. The Chinese government and other governments of emerging countries should do more to harness the power of state intervention in their response to the business cycle.","Chai, Kuang-Cheng; Yang, Yang; Cui, Zhen-Xin; Ou, Yang-Lu; Chang, Ke-Chiun",Front Public Health,305,24

There is an urgent need to find new therapeutic methods to prevent and control PEDV. Not only is there a shortage of commercial anti-PEDV drugs, but available commercial vaccines fail to protect against highly virulent PEDV variants. We screened an FDA-approved library of 911 natural products and found that tomatidine, a steroidal alkaloid extracted from the skin and leaves of tomatoes, demonstrates significant inhibition of PEDV replication in Vero and IPEC-J2 cells in vitro. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics analysis predicted interactions between tomatidine and the active pocket of PEDV 3CL protease, which were confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The inhibiting effect of tomatidine on 3CL protease was determined using cleavage visualization and FRET assay. Tomatidine-mediated blocking of 3CL protease activity in PEDV-infected cells was examined by western blot detection of the viral polyprotein in PEDV-infected cells. It indicates that tomatidine inhibits PEDV replication mainly by targeting 3CL protease. In addition, tomatidine also has antiviral activity against transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), encephalo myocarditis virus (EMCV) and seneca virus A (SVA) in vitro.

Here, we studied 489 SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained from 32 countries from the Nextstrain database and performed phylogenetic tree analysis by clade, country, and genotype of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) at site 614. We found that virus strains from mainland China were mostly distributed in Clade B and Clade undefined in the phylogenetic tree, with very few found in Clade A. In contrast, Clades A2 (one case) and A2a (112 cases) predominantly contained strains from European regions. Moreover, Clades A2 and A2a differed significantly from those of mainland China in age of infected population (P = 0.0071, mean age 40.24 to 46.66), although such differences did not exist between the US and mainland China. Further analysis demonstrated that the variation of the S protein at site 614 (QHD43416.1: p.614D>G) was a characteristic of stains in Clades A2 and A2a. Importantly, this variation was predicted to have neutral or benign effects on the function of the S protein. In addition, global quality estimates and 3D protein structures tended to be different between the two S proteins. In summary, we identified different genomic epidemiology among SARS-CoV-2 strains in different clades, especially in an amino acid variation of the S protein at 614, revealing potential viral genome divergence in SARS-CoV-2 strains.","Huang, Liang; Liu, Kui; Ma, Ke; Tian, Yuan; Qin, Yu; Sun, Haiyin; Ding, Wencheng; Gui, Lingli; Wu, Peng",,305,0

Here, we evaluated the role of climate (temperature and precipitation), region-specific COVID-19 susceptibility (BCG vaccination factors, malaria incidence, and percentage of the population aged over 65 years), and human mobility (relative amounts of international visitors) in shaping the geographical patterns of COVID-19 case numbers across 1,020 countries/regions, and examined the sequential shift that occurred from December 2019 to June 30, 2020 in multiple drivers of the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. Our regression model adequately explains the cumulative COVID-19 case numbers (per 1 million population). As the COVID-19 spread progressed, the explanatory power (R2) of the model increased, reaching > 70% in April 2020. Climate, host mobility, and host susceptibility to COVID-19 largely explained the variance among COVID-19 case numbers across locations; the relative importance of host mobility and that of host susceptibility to COVID-19 were both greater than that of climate. Notably, the relative importance of these factors changed over time; the number of days from outbreak onset drove COVID-19 spread in the early stage, then human mobility accelerated the pandemic, and lastly climate (temperature) propelled the phase following disease expansion. Our findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic is deterministically driven by climate suitability, cross-border human mobility, and region-specific COVID-19 susceptibility. The identification of these multiple drivers of the COVID-19 outbreak trajectory, based on mapping the spread of COVID-19, will contribute to a better understanding of the COVID-19 disease transmission risk and inform long-term preventative measures against this disease.","Kubota, Yasuhiro; Shiono, Takayuki; Kusumoto, Buntarou; Fujinuma, Junichi",PLoS One,305,16

Teledermoscopy, an extension of teledermatology, consists of consulting dermoscopic images, also transmitted through smartphones, to remotely diagnose skin tumors or other dermatological diseases. The purpose of this work was to verify the diagnostic validity of images acquired with an inexpensive smartphone microscope (NurugoTM), employing convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify malignant melanoma (MM), melanocytic nevus (MN), and seborrheic keratosis (SK). METHODS: The CNN, trained with 600 dermatoscopic images from the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) archive, was tested on three test sets: ISIC images, images acquired with the NurugoTM, and images acquired with a conventional dermatoscope. RESULTS: The results obtained, although with some limitations due to the smartphone device and small data set, were encouraging, showing comparable results to the clinical dermatoscope and up to 80% accuracy (out of 10 images, two were misclassified) using the NurugoTM demonstrating how an amateur device can be used with reasonable levels of diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSION: Considering the low cost and the ease of use, the NurugoTM device could be a useful tool for general practitioners (GPs) to perform the first triage of skin lesions, aiding the selection of lesions that require a face-to-face consultation with dermatologists.","Veronese, Federica; Branciforti, Francesco; Zavattaro, Elisa; Tarantino, Vanessa; Romano, Valentina; Meiburger, Kristen M; Salvi, Massimo; Seoni, Silvia; Savoia, Paola",Diagnostics (Basel),305,5

Multiple diagnostic tests are available without enough perspective on their reliability. Therefore, it is important to choose the most suitable test according to its sensitivity and specificity but also to the stage of the disease. Currently, the RT-PCR detection of the viral genome in respiratory samples is the most reliable test to confirm the diagnosis of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has to be done in Class II biological safety laboratory. However, it may lack sensitivity, particularly in the advanced phase of infection, and depends closely on the samples' quality. Rapid PCR by cartridge system reduces response times but is not suitable for laboratories with high throughput of requests. Detection of virus antigens on respiratory samples is a quick and easy to use technique; however it has not good specificity and sensitivity and cannot be used for diagnosis and patient management.

Several patients with severe COVID-19 infection can develop a coagulopathy according to the ISTH criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) with fulminant activation of coagulation, resulting in widespread microvascular thrombosis and consumption of coagulation factors. We conducted a meta-analysis in order to explore differences in coagulopathy indices in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. An electronic search was performed within PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus electronic databases between December 2019 (first confirmed Covid-19 case) up to April 6th, 2020. The primary endpoint was the difference of D-dimer values between Non-Severe vs Severe disease and Survivors vs Non-Survivors. Furthermore, results on additional coagulation parameters (platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time) were also analyzed. The primary analysis showed that mean d-dimer was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients with non-severe disease than in those with severe (SMD - 2.15 [- 2.73 to - 1.56], I2 98%, P < 0.0001). Similarly, we found a lower mean d-dimer in Survivors compared to Non-Survivors (SMD - 2.91 [- 3.87 to - 1.96], I2 98%, P < 0.0001). Additional analysis of platelet count showed higher levels of mean PLT in Non-Severe patients than those observed in the Severe group (SMD 0.77 [0.32 to 1.22], I2 96%, P < 0.001). Of note, a similar result was observed even when Survivors were compared to Non-Survivors (SMD 1.84 [1.16 to 2.53], I2 97%, P < 0.0001). Interestingly, shorter mean PT was found in both Non-Severe (SMD - 1.34 [- 2.06 to - 0.62], I2 98%, P < 0.0002) and Survivors groups (SMD - 1.61 [- 2.69 to - 0.54], I2 98%, P < 0.003) compared to Severe and Non-Survivor patients. In conclusion, the results of the present meta-analysis demonstrate that Severe COVID-19 infection is associated with higher D-dimer values, lower platelet count and prolonged PT. This data suggests a possible role of disseminated intravascular coagulation in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease complications.","Polimeni, Alberto; Leo, Isabella; Spaccarotella, Carmen; Mongiardo, Annalisa; Sorrentino, Sabato; Sabatino, Jolanda; De Rosa, Salvatore; Indolfi, Ciro",Sci Rep,305,17

DESIGN: Evidence-based perspective METHODS: Review and synthesis of pertinent literature RESULTS: Retrospective studies highlight that less than 1% of patients display COVID-19 related-conjunctivitis. However, prospective studies suggest the rate is higher, approximately 6%. Viral RNA has been identified in tears and conjunctival secretions in patients with active conjunctivitis as well as asymptomatic cases. Overall, conjunctival swabs are positive in 2.5%. Samples taken earlier in the disease course are more likely to demonstrate positive virus. Viral transmission through ocular tissues has not been substantiated. Ophthalmologists are in the high-risk category for COVID-19 infection for several reasons: high volume clinics, close proximity with patients, equipment intense clinics and direct contact with patients' conjunctival mucosal surfaces. COVID-19 is predominantly contracted through direct or airborne transmission by inhalation of respiratory droplets. Evidence that aerosol transmission occurs is increasing in particularly prolonged exposure to high concentrations in a relatively closed environment. Based on the current evidence ophthalmologists should consider measures that include social distancing, wearing masks, sterilisation techniques and managing clinic volumes. CONCLUSIONS: A major challenge to containing COVID-19 is that many infected people are asymptomatic. Droplet spread, contaminated environmental surfaces and shared medical devices are particular areas that require management by ophthalmologists. More studies are required to explore the role of the conjunctiva and ocular tissues in the transmission of disease.","Danesh-Meyer, Helen V; McGhee, Charles Nj",Am. j. ophthalmol,305,16

A quantitative proteomic comparison between metaphase-arrested cell lysates and chromosome-sorted samples reveals a cohort of proteins that were significantly enriched on mitotic ESC chromosomes. These include pluripotency-associated transcription factors, repressive chromatin-modifiers such as PRC2 and DNA methyl-transferases, and proteins governing chromosome architecture. Deletion of PRC2, Dnmt1/3a/3b or Mecp2 in ESCs leads to an increase in the size of individual mitotic chromosomes, consistent with de-condensation.

Here, we constructed two adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidates of Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S carrying the full-length gene of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The immunogenicity of two vaccines was individually evaluated in mice. Specific immune responses were observed by priming in a dose-dependent manner, and stronger responses were obtained by boosting. Furthermore, five rhesus macaques were primed with 5 × 109 PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S, followed by boosting with 5 × 109 PFU Ad49L-nCoV-S at 4-week interval. Both mice and macaques well tolerated the vaccine inoculations without detectable clinical or pathologic changes. In macaques, prime-boost regimen induced high titers of 103.16 anti-S, 102.75 anti-RBD binding antibody and 102.38 pseudovirus neutralizing antibody (pNAb) at 2 months, while pNAb decreased gradually to 101.45 at 7 months post-priming.

While such frameworks recapitulate the cellular entry process in ACE2+ cells, they are largely unable to factor in supplemental contributions by other SARS CoV-2 genes. To address this, we performed an unbiased ORF screen and identified the nucleoprotein (N) as a potent enhancer of spike-pseudotyped LV particle infectivity. We further demonstrate that the spike protein is better enriched in virions when the particles are produced in the presence of N protein. This enrichment of spike renders LV particles more infectious as well as less vulnerable to the neutralizing effects of a human IgG-Fc fused ACE2 microbody. Importantly, this improvement in infectivity is observed with both wild-type spike protein as well as the D614G mutant.

We use district level evidence on COVID-19 vaccine uptake rates from an LMIC - India to provide evidence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We argue that vaccination rates during the different phases of COVID-19 vaccination across the districts is likely to be related to vaccine hesitancy. Districts with larger rural population and lower literacy rates had lower vaccination rates. High past child immunization rates were positively correlated with COVID-19 vaccination uptake. Across the four phases of vaccination drive, vaccine hesitancy was the highest during the third phase of the vaccination drive, and therefore the above correlations were strongest during the third and the fourth phase.

Despite the relevance of the problem, a satisfactory comprehension of the mechanisms involved has not still be achieved because of the wide range of turbulent scales and the huge number of droplets involved. In this context, we address a DNS of a turbulent jet spray at relatively high Reynolds number, i.e. Re=10,000. We focus on the effect of the jet Re on the evaporation process and the preferential segregation of droplets, comparing the outcomes also with a DNS at lower Reynolds number, Re = 6,000, in corresponding conditions. The problem is addressed in the hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian framework employing the point-droplet approximation. Detailed statistical analysis on both the gas and dispersed phases are presented. We found that the droplet vaporization length grows as the bulk Re is increased from Re = 6,000 to Re = 10,000 keeping other conditions fixed. We attribute this result to the complex interaction between the inertia of the droplets and the turbulent gaseous phase dynamics. In particular, at higher Re, the slower droplet mass transfer is not able to comply with the faster turbulent fluctuations of the mixing layer that tend to fasten the process. We also found an intense droplet clustering which is originated by entrainment of dry air in the mixing layer and intensified by the small-scale clustering mechanism in the far-field region. We will show how clustering creates a strongly heterogeneous droplet Lagrangian evolution. All these aspects contribute to the Re dependence of the overall droplet evaporation rate. Finally, we discuss the accuracy of the d-square law, often used in spray modeling, for present cases. We found that using this law based on environmental conditions the droplet evaporation rate is overestimated.","Wang, Jietuo; Barba, Federico Dalla; Picano, Francesco",,305,1

It has been pointed out that the prime reason behind this is the bombardment of information ranging from accurate to exaggerated to grossly incorrect by the media. Aims: We aimed to assess the nature and extent of the coverage pertaining to mental health and COVID 19 in the print media. Subjects and Methods: In our prospective study, all print items related to the mental health aspects of COVID-19 published in a national daily, The Hindu and a regional daily, The Tribune were included. Results: A low percentage of the total print items related to COVID-19 pertained to the mental health aspects in both newspapers. Most of the print items appeared on the inner pages. Anxiety was the most common mental health problem mentioned, followed by depression and fear for one's own safety. Yoga, meditation, other forms of physical exercise, contacting helplines, and talking to people were the most commonly suggested ways to manage mental health problems. The opinion of a mental health professional was sought in only 13.33% of the print items in The Tribune, whereas the corresponding figure for The Hindu was 65%. Conclusions: We found that the coverage was less extensive as compared to the reported prevalence of mental health problems associated with COVID-19. Our findings underscore the need for more exhaustive and widespread reporting of mental health problems associated with the pandemic.","Gul, D.; Sidhu, G.

We have described for the first time the occurrence of thyrotoxicosis due to atypical subacute thyroiditis in 15% of patients hospitalised for Covid-19 pneumonia, compared with only 1% among patients hospitalised in the same wards during Spring 2019, thus before the Covid-19 pandemic. The whole group of Covid-19 patients also had median serum TSH concentrations significantly lower compared with the control group. The atypical thyroiditis induced by Covid-19 is not associated with neck pain, affects more men than women and especially those severely ill, thus coexists with non-thyroidal illness syndrome. Subacute thyroiditis is classically followed by subsequent occurrence of permanent thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity, thus we have started a systematic follow-up program of these patients.","Muller, Ilaria Cannavaro Daniele Dazzi Davide Mantovani Giovanna Longari Virgilio Cuzzocrea Marco Re Tiziana E.; Gori, Andrea Arosio Maura Salvi Mario Giovanni",Journal of the Endocrine Society,305,16

Different guidelines are being followed worldwide on how to deal with a COVID-19 positive corpse. The aim of this review is to compare different guidelines and literature on best practice for handling a COVID-19 positive corpse. RESULTS: The guidelines vary greatly in the use of PPE's and other safety measures especially during autopsy. There is great variation in the use of disinfectant and its concentration. Also recommended funeral services and contact with relatives vary greatly. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, there is very limited scientific evidence on which the researched guidelines are based. It is unclear why some guidelines propose a ""business as usual"" attitude and others a ""code-red"" attitude. More scientific evidence is needed to substantiate the handling of COVID-19 positive corpses to make an educated decision on how to safely handle a COVID-19 positive corpse.","Dijkhuizen, L G M; Gelderman, H T; Duijst, W L J M",J Forensic Leg Med,305,1

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of radiographers in the detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT using CO-RADS descriptors. METHODS: CT images of patients who underwent RT-PCR and chest CT due to COVID-19 suspicion between March and July 2020 were analysed retrospectively. Six readers, including two radiologists, two highly experienced radiographers and two less experienced radiographers, independently scored each CT using the CO-RADS lexicon. ROC curves were used to investigate diagnostic accuracy, and Fleiss'&#954; statistics to evaluate inter-rater agreement. RESULTS: 714 patients (419 men; 295 women; mean age: 64 years ±19SD) were evaluated. CO-RADS> 3 was identified as optimal diagnostic threshold. Highly experienced radiographers achieved an average sensitivity of 58.7% (95%CI: 52.5-64.7), an average specificity of 81.8% (95%CI: 77.9-85.2), and a mean AUC of 0.72 (95%CI: 0.68-0.75). Among less experienced radiographers, an average sensitivity of 56.3% (95%CI: 50.1-62.2) and an average specificity of 81.5% (95%CI: 77.6-84.9) were observed, with a mean AUC of 0.71 (95%CI: 0.68-0.74). Consultant radiologists achieved an average sensitivity of 60.0% (95%CI: 53.7-65.8), an average specificity of 81.7% (95%CI: 77.8-85.1), and a mean AUC of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.70-0.77). CONCLUSION: Radiographers can adequately recognise the classic appearances of COVID-19 on CT, as described by the CO-RADS assessment scheme, in a way comparable to expert radiologists. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Radiographers, as the first healthcare professionals to evaluate CT images in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, could diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia by means of a categorical reporting scheme at CT in a reliable way, hence playing a primary role in the early management of these patients.","Vicini, S; Panvini, N; Bellini, D; Rengo, M; Ciotola, M; De Vivo, M; Gambaretto, C; Caldon, V; Panno, S; Del Borgo, C; Carbone, I","Radiography (Lond.

We set-up a multicenter Italian collaboration (CORIST Project, ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04318418) to retrospectively investigate the relationship between RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. We also carried out an updated meta-analysis on the relevant studies. METHODS: We analyzed 4069 unselected patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalized in 34 clinical centers in Italy from February 19, 2020 to May 23, 2020. The primary end-point in a time-to event analysis was in-hospital death, comparing patients who received angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) with patients who did not. Articles for the meta-analysis were retrieved until July 13th, 2020 by searching in web-based libraries, and data were combined using the general variance-based method. RESULTS: Out of 4069 COVID-19 patients, 13.5% and 13.3% received ACE-I or ARB, respectively. Use of neither ACE-I nor ARB was associated with mortality (multivariable hazard ratio (HR) adjusted also for COVID-19 treatments: 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.77-1.20 and HR = 0.89, 0.67-1.19 for ACE-I and ARB, respectively). Findings were similar restricting the analysis to hypertensive (N = 2057) patients (HR = 1.00, 0.78-1.26 and HR = 0.88, 0.65-1.20) or when ACE-I or ARB were considered as a single group. Results from the meta-analysis (19 studies, 29,057 COVID-19 adult patients, 9700 with hypertension) confirmed the absence of association. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study and meta-analysis of the literature, ACE-I or ARB use was not associated with severity or in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients.",,Vascul Pharmacol,305,21

STUDY TYPE: Cross-sectional multi-institutional survey. METHODS: An online survey of 55 otolaryngology departments across North America. RESULTS: As of March 25, 2020, almost all (n = 53 of 55, 96.3%) otolaryngology departments had canceled elective cases and were performing only urgent consults. Most residents continued to participate in operative cases (n = 45 of 49, 91.8%) and take call (n = 48 of 50, 96.0%). Of the respondents, 27 of 29 (93.1%) stated that they were deferring nonemergent tracheostomy procedures for the time being. The use of personal protective equipment followed a general trend of an increasing level of protection with an increased risk of the procedure; most (n = 49 of 54, 90.7%) incorporated N95 mask usage for bedside/clinic examinations with flexible laryngoscopy. Powered air-purifying respirators and N95 masks were used mainly for procedures involving the mucosal surfaces. DISCUSSION: Due to the high viral density in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx of patients with COVID-19, basic examinations and common otolaryngology procedures place practitioners at high risk of exposure. Although there is variability in practice among otolaryngologists across North America in managing the COVID-19 outbreak, most are primarily seeing urgent ambulatory and inpatient consultations. Most are also incorporating personal protective equipment appropriate to the level of transmission across mucous membranes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In these rapidly evolving times, it is helpful to find solidarity and assurance among health care providers. Current data aimed to provide (1) perceived methods regarding the safe care of otolaryngology patients and (2) updated practice patterns at a national level.","Wickemeyer, Johanna L; Billings, Kathleen R; Valika, Taher S",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,305,16

Physical activity has been shown to improve mental as well as physical health. Increasing activity levels should be prioritized as a treatment target, especially when the barriers to exercise are greater than ever. Promoting physical activity has not traditionally been the remit of psychologists. Yet psychological theory and therapeutic techniques can be readily applied to address physical inactivity. We present theoretical perspectives and therapy techniques relating to (1) beliefs about physical activity, (2) motivation to be physically active, and (3) the sense of reward achieved through being physically active. We outline strategies to initiate and maintain physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby benefitting mental and physical health. COVID-19 is demanding rapid and substantial change across the whole health care system. Psychological therapists can respond creatively by addressing physical activity, a treatable clinical target which delivers both mental and physical health benefits. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Physical activity is essential for our mental and physical health. Yet COVID-19 presents novel barriers to physical activity. Psychological theory and techniques to address beliefs, motivation, and reward can be applied to increase physical activity during COVID-19. Physical activity is an important clinical target to sustain and improve mental health, especially in the current pandemic.","Diamond, Rowan; Waite, Felicity",Psychol. psychother,305,1

This difficulty is the cause of additional costs, with the further drawback that the resulting application will again be hardly reusable. It is a negative loop which consistently reinforces itself and for which there seems to be no way out. iTelos is a general purpose methodology designed to break this loop. Its main goal is to generate reusable Knowledge Graphs (KGs), built reusing, as much as possible, already existing data. The key assumption is that the design of a KG should be done middle-out meaning by this that the design should take into consideration, in all phases of the development: (i) the purpose to be served, that we formalize as a set of competency queries, (ii) a set of pre-existing datasets, possibly extracted from existing KGs, and (iii) a set of pre-existing reference schemas, whose goal is to facilitate sharability. We call these reference schemas, teleologies, as distinct from ontologies, meaning by this that, while having a similar purpose, they are designed to be easily adapted, thus becoming a key enabler of itelos.","Giunchiglia, Fausto; Bocca, Simone; Fumagalli, Mattia; Bagchi, Mayukh; Zamboni, Alessio",,305,26

Bariatric patients are more prone to severe infection due to their high body mass index (BMI) and are more vulnerable to the effects of isolation, such as depression or disruption of their health habits. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the impact of self-quarantine on bariatric patients and self-quarantine's relationship with weight gain. SETTING: Academic hospital, United States. METHODS: A 30-item survey examining several known contributors to weight regain was distributed among the postoperative bariatric patients of our clinic. Changes in eating habits, exercise, depression, social support, loneliness, and anxiety were studied, among others. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients completed the survey (29.3% response rate). A large percentage of patients reported increases in their depression (44.2%), loneliness (36.2%), nervousness (54.7%), snacking (62.6%), loss of control when eating (48.2%), and binge eating (19.5%) and decreases in their social support (23.2%), healthy food eating (45.5%), and activity (55.2%). Difficulty in accessing vitamins was reported by 13%. Patients more than 18 months out of surgery regained more than 2 kg during an average of 47 days. Risk factors for weight regain were found to be loss of control when eating, increases in snacking and binge eating, reduced consumption of healthy food, and reduced physical activity. CONCLUSION: Bariatric patients are negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social isolation on many levels. This patient population is vulnerable to crisis situations; thus, additional intervention is needed to address behaviors that lead to weight regain.","Athanasiadis, Dimitrios I; Hernandez, Edward; Hilgendorf, William; Roper, Alexandra; Embry, Marisa; Selzer, Don; Stefanidis, Dimitrios",Surg. obes. relat. dis,305,1

This situation has forced both teachers and students into an atypical, very specific situation, in which they need to cope with a number of psychological factors. Meanwhile, there is a research gap in academic knowledge of the social and psychological factors that determine attitudes toward forced remote learning. Objective: To analyze the psychological traits of students in relation to their attitudes toward forced remote learning. Methods: The study assessed self-regulation and communication skills, as well thinking and learning styles of 280 students in the situation of forced remote learning. We used the methods of surveying and psychological testing for data collection. The data were analyzed in R statistical software using the regression modeling methods. Results: We found that the number of students with positive (46%) and negative (54%) attitudes toward forced remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic was approximately equal. Using regression analysis, we identified several statistically significant associations between the interpersonal communicative skills of students (self-regulation, shyness, alienation, manipulative and cooperative communication styles) and their thinking styles (right-hemispheric and integrated), on the one hand, and their attitude to remote learning, on the other. It was also illustrated that depending on the attitude to the forced remote learning, students differ by the percentage of assimilated learning materials while studying under the lockdown. Conclusion: The results identify that success of remote learning in many ways depends on the extent to which it accommodates psychological traits of students who are forced to acquire new knowledge without traditional classroom instruction. © Copyright © 2021 Dikaya, Avanesian, Dikiy, Kirik and Egorova.","Dikaya, L.

A large proportion of older adults in Mexico have high prevalence of multimorbidity and live in poverty with limited access to health care services. These statistics are even higher among adults living in rural areas, which suggests that older adults in rural communities may be more susceptible to COVID-19. The objectives of the article were to compare clinical and demographic characteristics for people diagnosed with COVID-19 by age group, and to describe cases and mortality in rural and urban communities. METHODS: We linked publicly available from the Mexican Ministry of Health and the Census. Municipalities were classified based on population as rural (<2500), semi-rural (&#8805; 2,500 and <15,000), semi-urban (&#8805;15,000 and <100,000) and urban (&#8805;100,000). Zero-inflated negative binomial models were performed to calculate the total number of COVID-19 cases, and deaths per 1,000,000 persons using the population of each municipality as a denominator. RESULTS: Older adults were more likely to be hospitalized and reported severe cases, with higher mortality rates. In addition, rural municipalities reported a higher number of COVID-19 cases and mortality related to COVID-19 per million than urban municipalities. The adjusted absolute difference in COVID-19 cases was 912.7 per million (95% Confidence Interval (CI),79.0 - 1746.4) and mortality related to COVID-19 was 390.6 per million (95% CI, 204.5 - 576.7).

In this consecutive study, we analysed RB and optic nerve biopsies (ONBs) in deceased patients with confirmed COVID-19 assessing viral RNA load, possible virus replication and infectivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this case series, 14 eyes of 14 deceased patients with COVID-19 were enucleated during autopsy. RB and ONB were subjected to molecular detection of viral RNA, virus cultivation and immunohistochemistry. SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads were compared with RNA loads in the respective throat swabs, vitreous humour and blood samples. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 7/14 RBs and in 10/13 ONBs. While virus isolation failed and immunohistochemistry of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was negative, subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) was detectable (40% RB; 60% ONB). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detectable in RB and ONB of patients with COVID-19. Presence of sgRNA could point to a SARS-CoV-2 infection of neuronal tissue, but as virus isolation failed and immunohistochemistry of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was negative, an active infection seems unlikely.","Casagrande, Maria; Fitzek, Antonia; Spitzer, Martin; Püschel, Klaus; Glatzel, Markus; Krasemann, Susanne; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Nörz, Dominik; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Pfefferle, Susanne; Schultheiss, Maximilian",Br. j. ophthalmol,305,16

Antimicrobial agents have been clinically proven to be effective in the pharmacological treatment of polymicrobial diseases. Unfortunately, an increasing trend in the emergence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens and limited options for delivery of antimicrobial drugs might seriously impact humans' efforts to combat polymicrobial diseases in the coming decades. New antimicrobial agents with novel mechanism(s) of action and new pharmaceutical formulations or delivery systems to target infected sites are urgently required. In this review, we discuss the prospective use of novel antimicrobial compounds isolated from natural products to treat polymicrobial infections, mainly via mechanisms related to inhibition of biofilm formation. Drug-delivery systems developed to deliver antimicrobial compounds to both intracellular and extracellular pathogens are discussed. We further discuss the effectiveness of several biofilm-targeted delivery strategies to eliminate polymicrobial biofilms.

Concurrently, our host nation, which previously had reported the highest number of daily deaths from COVID-19, was deep within a second wave of infections, increasing hospital admissions, near intensive care unit capacity, and deaths. As USNH Rota was not normally equipped for the complex infusion center required to effectively deliver the monoclonal antibody, we coordinated a multi-directorate and multidisciplinary effort in order to set up an infusion room that could be dedicated to help with our fight against COVID. Identifying a physician team lead, with subject matter experts from nursing, pharmacy, facilities, and enlisted corpsmen, our team carefully ensured that all requisite steps were set up in advance in order to be able to identify the appropriate patients proactively and treat them safely with the infusion that has been clinically proven to decrease hospital admissions and mortality. Additional benefits included the establishment of an additional negative pressure room near our emergency room for both COVID-19 patients and, when needed, the monoclonal antibody infusion.

We aimed to establish if dead-space ventilation is different in patients with COVID-19 ARDS when compared with patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS. METHODS: A total of 187 subjects with COVID-19 ARDS and 178 subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS who were undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation were included in the study. The association between the ARDS types and dead-space ventilation, compliance of the respiratory system, subjects' characteristics, organ failures, and mechanical ventilation was evaluated by using data collected in the first 24 h of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Corrected minute ventilation (VÌE), a dead-space ventilation surrogate, was higher in the subjects with COVID-19 ARDS versus in those with non-COVID-19 ARDS (median [interquartile range] 12.6 [10.2-15.8] L/min vs 9.4 [7.5-11.6] L/min; P < .001). Increased corrected VÌE was independently associated with COVID-19 ARDS (odds ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.47; P = .007). The best compliance of the respiratory system, obtained after testing different PEEPs, was similar between the subjects with COVID-19 ARDS and the subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS (mean ± SD 38 ± 11 mL/cm H2O vs 37 ± 11 mL/cm H2O, respectively; P = .61). The subjects with COVID-19 ARDS received higher median (interquartile range) PEEP (12 [10-14] cm H2O vs 8 [5-9] cm H2O; P < .001) and lower median (interquartile range) tidal volume (5.8 [5.5-6.3] mL/kg vs 6.6 [6.1-7.3] mL/kg; P < .001) than the subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS, being these differences maintained at multivariable analysis. In the multivariable analysis, the subjects with COVID-19 ARDS showed a lower risk of anamnestic arterial hypertension (odds ratio 0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.45; P < .001) and lower neurologic sequential organ failure assessment score (odds ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.09-0.27; P < .001) than the subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect measurements of dead space were higher in subjects with COVID-19 ARDS compared with subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS. The best compliance of the respiratory system was similar in both ARDS forms provided that different PEEPs were applied. A wide range of compliance is present in every ARDS type; therefore, the setting of mechanical ventilation should be individualized patient by patient and not based on the etiology of ARDS.","Bertelli, Michele; Fusina, Federica; Prezioso, Chiara; Cavallo, Erika; Nencini, Niccolò; Crisci, Serena; Tansini, Francesca; Mari, Letizia Mazzuca; Hoxha, Laureta; Lombardi, Fabiana; Natalini, Giuseppe",Respir. care,305,1

Efforts to define ways to assess functionality of health systems have however varied, with many not translating into concrete policy action and influence on system development. We present an approach to provide countries with information on the functionality of their systems in a manner that will facilitate movement towards universal health coverage. We conceptualise functionality of a health system as being a construct of four capacities: access to, quality of, demand for essential services and its resilience to external shocks. We test and confirm the validity of these capacities as appropriate measures of system functionality. We thus provide results for functionality of the 47 countries of the WHO African Region based on this. The functionality of health systems ranges from 34.4 to 75.8 on a 0-100 scale. Access to essential services represents the lowest capacity in most countries of the region, specifically due to poor physical access to services. Funding levels from public and out-of-pocket sources represent the strongest predictors of system functionality, compared with other sources. By focusing on the assessment on the capacities that define system functionality, each country has concrete information on where it needs to focus, in order to improve the functionality of its health system to enable it respond to current needs including achieving universal health coverage, while responding to shocks from challenges such as the 2019 coronavirus disease. This systematic and replicable approach for assessing health system functionality can provide the guidance needed for investing in country health systems to attain universal health coverage goals.","Karamagi, Humphrey Cyprian; Tumusiime, Prosper; Titi-Ofei, Regina; Droti, Benson; Kipruto, Hillary; Nabyonga-Orem, Juliet; Seydi, Aminata Binetou-Wahebine; Zawaira, Felicitas; Schmets, Gerard; Cabore, Joseph Waogodo",,305,16

Surprisingly, IgG and IgM antibody testing was negative 2 months after reinfection. Although no negative testing was performed between the two symptomatic bouts, this case raises the possibility of reinfection after controlling the virus and highlights the long period with which a patient can shed virus and experience symptoms after initial infection.

The reported mutation rate (â¼10-6 nucleotide [nt]-1 cycle-1) for SARS-CoV-2 is typical for coronaviruses.

In this study, the marine sponge-derived natural compounds 4,6-dibromo-2-(2',4'-dibromophenoxy)phenol and 3,4,6-tribromo-2-(2',4'-dibromophenoxy)phenol were found to exhibit broad antibacterial activity against medically relevant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. The compounds were not only bactericidal against both replicating and stationary phase-persistent planktonic cells of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; they also killed biofilm-incorporated cells of both species while not affecting biofilm structural integrity. Moreover, these compounds were active against carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter sp. This simultaneous activity of compounds against different growth forms of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is rare. Genome sequencing of spontaneous resistant mutants and proteome analysis suggest that resistance is mediated by downregulation of the bacterial EIIBC phosphotransferase components scrA and mtlA in MRSA likely leading to a lower uptake of the molecules. Due to their only moderate cytotoxicity against human cell lines, phenoxyphenols provide an interesting new scaffold for development of antimicrobial agents with activity against planktonic cells, persisters and biofilm-incoporated cells of ESKAPE pathogens.

502367,502367,502367,Concrete Recommendations for Cutting Through Misinformation During the COVID-19 Pandemic,20.157074,2.0250514,2020,"BACKGROUND: Until 1960, hundreds of thousands of children worldwide had been treated for scalp ringworm by epilation via irradiation. The discovery of late health effects in adulthood prompted investigation of the medical aspects of irradiation in childhood and led to the establishment of strict protocols for the use of X-ray irradiation. These studies ignored alopecia, which affects some individuals who underwent irradiation for scalp ringworm as children. This study examined the impact of alopecia due to irradiation for scalp ringworm on the health and psychosocial status of affected women. METHODS: We analysed a random sample of 130 medical files of women recognised by Israel's state committees as suffering from permanent hair loss as a result of scalp ringworm irradiation in childhood. The coded medical data included demographic variables, self-reported mental health conditions, self-reported physical health conditions, self-reported social conditions, and spousal relationship. RESULTS: Compared with the general population of women in Israel, research participants reported significantly higher rates of depression, anti-depressant and/or anti-anxiety drug use, psychotherapy or psychiatric hospitalisation, attempted suicide, migraines, cancer, and divorce. Many described humiliating social experiences due to their appearance, both in childhood and adulthood, that led them to curtail their social interactions. The participants also reported that alopecia negatively affected their spousal relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Life with hair loss from scalp ringworm irradiation in childhood has a negative impact on women's health status and psychosocial state. Health policy-makers must broaden their approach to women who underwent scalp ringworm irradiation by addressing the effects of their hair loss in addition to the effects of the radiation treatment per se. This may be achieved by guiding physicians who provide medical services to these women to take into account the psychosocial and health risks related to hair loss in their diagnosis and treatment as well as by creating a cadre of specially trained mental health professionals who can address their unique psychosocial needs. They must also consider including the specialized mental health services tailored for these women's unique needs in the Healthcare Basket.","Hoffer, Liat; Shvarts, Shifra; Segal-Engelchin, Dorit",Isr J Health Policy Res,305,24

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic had led to an increase in demand for remote care in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who require monitoring and frequent access to health services. DESIGN - METHODS: A retrospective study of all activity (in person and by phone call or email) done on the unit during the acute phase of the pandemic at a reference hospital in Spain. Numbers of activities done by nurses, reasons for telehealth care and sociodemographic and clinical data were collected. Statistical analysis was performed using frequency, chi-squared and analysis of variance tests. RESULTS: A total of 1095 activities for 561 patients who received care were reported. Among them, 1042 (95.2%) were telemedicine activities, amounting to a 47.3% increase over the prior year. COVID-19-related activities numbered 588 (59.5%). Consultations due to disease flare-up numbered 134 (13.7%), representing a 145% increase compared to 2019. Significant differences were found between reasons for using telemedicine and diagnosis, occupational status, contact week and treatment. CONCLUSION: The acute phase of the pandemic has changed the activity managed by the nursing staff on the unit. Identifying and analysing these changes has yielded valuable information to achieve more efficient management and better care quality for patients in special situations.","Navarro-Correal, Ester; Borruel, Natalia; Robles, Virginia; Herrera-de Guise, Claudia; Mayorga Ayala, Luis Fernando; Pérez Martínez, Zahira; Ibarz Casas, Arantxa; Agustino Rodríguez, Sandra; Batuecas Duelt, Irene Joana; García Alcaide, Jorge; López Branchadell, Sara; Zuriguel-Perez, Esperanza; Casellas, Francesc",Gastroenterol. hepatol.

Method This was a prospective longitudinal study of 98 adults (66 women) with baseline ages ranging from 40 to 85 years. The mean interval between T1 baseline and T2 follow-up measurements was 8.8 years with a range of 7-11 years. Measures of hearing threshold, gap detection, and auditory temporal-order identification were completed at T1 and T2. Cognitive measures completed at T1 and T2 were the 13 scales of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition. Three approaches were taken to analyze these data: (a) examination of changes over time in group performance, (b) correlations and slopes between auditory and cognitive measures to examine concomitant rates of decline over the 9-year T1-to-T2 period, and (c) regression analyses examining associations between auditory performance at T1 and cognitive performance 9 years later at T2. Results For the group data, there were significant declines in hearing loss, gap-detection thresholds at one frequency, and process-type measures of cognitive function from T1 to T2 matching the trends in the baseline cross-sectional data. Regression analyses of the longitudinal data revealed the strongest connection between auditory temporal-order processing and cognitive processing typically explaining 10%-15% of the variance. Conclusions A significant amount of variance in rates of cognitive decline, T1 to T2, and subsequent cognitive performance (T2) was explained by measures of auditory function. Although hearing loss occasionally emerged as a significant factor, auditory temporal-order identification emerged much more frequently as the auditory measure most strongly associated with cognitive function.","Humes, Larry E",J Speech Lang Hear Res,305,20

In this study, CRC screening key indicators, including the FIT(fecal immunochemical test) screening rate (or participation rate) and the rate of undergoing colonoscopy after positive FIT in 2019 and 2020, were surveyed in individual countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The impact of the pandemic on the effectiveness of CRC screening was simulated given different screening rates and colonoscopy rates and assuming the pandemic would persist or remain poorly controlled for a long period of time, using the empirical data from the Taiwanese program and the CRC natural history model. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the programs in this region were affected, but to different extents, which was largely influenced by the severity of the local pandemic. Most of the programs continued screening services in 2020, although a temporary pause occurred in some countries. The modeling study revealed that prolonged pauses of screening led to 6% lower effectiveness in reducing CRC mortality. Screening organizers should coordinate with health authorities to elaborate on addressing screening backlogs, setting priorities for screening, and applying modern technologies to overcome potential obstacles. Many novel approaches that were developed and applied during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the risk-stratified approach that takes into account personal CRC risk and the local epidemic status, as well as new digital technologies, are expected to play important roles in CRC screening in the future.","Chiu, Han-Mo; Su, Chiu-Wen; Hsu, Weng-Feng; Jen, Grace Hsiao-Hsuan; Hsu, Chen-Yang; Chen, Sam Li-Sheng; Chen, Hsiu-Hsi",Prev Med,305,1

STUDY DESIGN: By using a convenience sampling approach, 129 out of 205 randomly selected healthcare professionals from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine were invited to take part in a WeChat messaging app survey, Questionnaire Star, via a survey link. Healthcare personnel details were collected, including profession, years of professional experience and adverse reactions while wearing L3PPE. Survey results were divided by profession and years of professional experience; differences in adverse reactions were compared. RESULTS: Among the 129 healthcare professionals surveyed, 21 (16.28%) were doctors and 108 (83.72%) were nurses. A total of 122 (94.57%) healthcare professionals experienced discomfort while wearing L3PPE to treat patients with COVID-19. The main reasons for adverse reactions and discomfort include varying degrees of adverse skin reactions, respiratory difficulties, heat stress, dizziness and nausea. Doctors had a lower incidence of rashes (&#967;2=4.519, p=0.034) and dizziness (&#967;2=4.123, p=0.042) when compared with nurses. Junior (8.5 years of experience or fewer) healthcare personnel also experienced a higher rate of heat stress when compared with senior personnel (more than 8.5 years greater) (&#967;2=5.228, p=0.022). CONCLUSION: More attention should be offered to healthcare personnel wearing L3PPE to treat patients with COVID-19 because they are susceptible to developing adverse reactions.","Yuan, Niu; Yang, Wei-Xia; Lu, Jian-Li; Lv, Zhang-Hong",Postgrad. med. j,305,24

However, the exact role of Levamisole effect in clinical status of COVID-19 patients is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Levamisole on clinical status of patients with COVID-19 during their course of the disease. METHODS: This prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial was performed in adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (room-air oxygen saturation > 94%) from late April 2020 to mid-August 2020. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a 3-day course of Levamisole or placebo in combination with routine standard of care. RESULTS: With 25 patients in each arm, 50 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Most of the study participants were men (60%). On days 3 and 14, patients in Levamisole group had significantly better cough status distribution when compared to the placebo group (P-value = 0.034 and 0.005, respectively). Moreover, there was significant differences between the two groups in dyspnea at follow-up intervals of 7 (P-value = 0.015) and 14 (P-value = 0.010) days after receiving the interventions. However, no significant difference in fever status was observed on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 in both groups (P-value > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of the current study suggest that Levamisole may improve most of clinical status of patients with COVID-19. The patients receiving Levamisole had significantly better chance of clinical status including cough and dyspnea on day 14 when compared to the placebo. However, the effect-size of this finding has uncertain clinical importance.

Findings revealed, six success themes and eight major challenges from the voice of teachers experiencing a rapid and unprepared shift to virtual education. Suggestions for improving digital education revolve around four areas which suggest that pupils from marginal socioeconomic households were significantly disadvantaged during the COVID-driven virtual education scheme.

SARS, MERS, Ebola, Nipah and an array of arenavirus infections sporadically spillover into human populations and are often contained only as a result of their poor transmission in human hosts, coupled with intense public health control efforts in the early stages of an emerging epidemic. It is now more apparent than ever that we need a better and more proactive approach. One possibility is to eliminate the threat of spillover before it occurs using vaccines capable of autonomously spreading through wild animal reservoirs. We are now poised to begin developing self-disseminating vaccines targeting a wide range of human pathogens, but important decisions remain about how they can be most effectively designed and used to target pathogens with a high risk of spillover and/or emergence. In this Perspective, we first review the basic epidemiological theory establishing the feasibility and utility of self-disseminating vaccines. We then outline a road map for overcoming remaining technical challenges: identifying high-risk pathogens before they emerge, optimizing vaccine design with an eye to evolution, behaviour and epidemiology, and minimizing the risk of unintended consequences.","Nuismer, Scott L; Bull, James J",Nat Ecol Evol,305,1

Currently, there are no effective treatments for the majority of advanced lung diseases and lung transplantation remains the only hope for many chronically ill patients. Key opinion leaders speculate that the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, may lead to long-term lung damage, further exacerbating the need for regenerative therapies. New strategies for regenerative cell-based therapies harness the differentiation capability of human iPSCs for studying pulmonary disease pathogenesis and treatment. Excitingly, biomaterials are a cell culture platform that can be precisely designed to direct stem cell differentiation. Here, we present a closer look at the state-of-the-art of iPSC differentiation for pulmonary engineering, offer evidence supporting the power of biomaterials to improve stem cell differentiation, and discuss our perspective on the potential for tissue-informed biomaterials to transform pulmonary regenerative medicine.","Campbell, D.

Since there is no effective vaccine and treatment for this virus, therefore, the only way to mitigate this infection is the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social-distancing, community lockdown, quarantine, hospitalization or self-isolation and contact-tracing. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to explore the transmission dynamics and possible control of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, one of the Asian countries with a high burden of disease with more than 200,000 confirmed infected cases so far. Initially, a mathematical model without optimal control is formulated and some of the basic necessary analysis of the model, including stability results of the disease-free equilibrium is presented. It is found that the model is stable around the disease-free equilibrium both locally and globally when the basic reproduction number is less than unity. Despite the basic analysis of the model, we further consider the confirmed infected COVID-19 cases documented in Pakistan from March 1, till May 28, 2020 and estimate the model parameters using the least square fitting tools from statistics and probability theory. The results show that the model output is in good agreement with the reported COVID-19 infected cases. The approximate value of the basic reproductive number based on the estimated parameters is R 0≈1.87. The effect of low (or mild), moderate, and comparatively strict control interventions like social-distancing, quarantine rate, (or contact-tracing of suspected people) and hospitalization (or self-isolation) of testing positive COVID-19 cases are shown graphically. It is observed that the most effective strategy to minimize the disease burden is the implementation of maintaining a strict social-distancing and contact-tracing to quarantine the exposed people. Furthermore, we carried out the global sensitivity analysis of the most crucial parameter known as the basic reproduction number using the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and the partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) techniques. The proposed model is then reformulated by adding the time-dependent control variables u 1(t) for quarantine and u 2(t) for the hospitalization interventions and present the necessary optimality conditions using the optimal control theory and Pontryagin's maximum principle. Finally, the impact of constant and optimal control interventions on infected individuals is compared graphically.","Ullah, Saif; Khan, Muhammad Altaf",Chaos Solitons Fractals,305,29

METHODS: In this cohort study, we captured the data encompassing the first wave of the pandemic in Scotland, from March 1, 2020, when the first case was identified, to July 31, 2020, when infection rates had dropped sufficiently that shielding measures were officially terminated. The participants were the total population of Scotland, including all people with diabetes who were alive 3 weeks before the start of the pandemic in Scotland (estimated Feb 7, 2020). We ascertained how many people developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in this period from the Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland database (on virology), the RAPID database of daily hospitalisations, the Scottish Morbidity Records-01 of hospital discharges, the National Records of Scotland death registrations data, and the Scottish Intensive Care Society and Audit Group database (on critical care). Among people with fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19, diabetes status was ascertained by linkage to the national diabetes register, Scottish Care Information Diabetes. We compared the cumulative incidence of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with and without diabetes using logistic regression. For people with diabetes, we obtained data on potential risk factors for fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 from the national diabetes register and other linked health administrative databases. We tested the association of these factors with fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes, and constructed a prediction model using stepwise regression and 20-fold cross-validation. FINDINGS: Of the total Scottish population on March 1, 2020 (n=5â463â300), the population with diabetes was 319â349 (5·8%), 1082 (0·3%) of whom developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 by July 31, 2020, of whom 972 (89·8%) were aged 60 years or older. In the population without diabetes, 4081 (0·1%) of 5â143â951 people developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19. As of July 31, the overall odds ratio (OR) for diabetes, adjusted for age and sex, was 1·395 (95% CI 1·304-1·494; p<0·0001, compared with the risk in those without diabetes. The OR was 2·396 (1·815-3·163; p<0·0001) in type 1 diabetes and 1·369 (1·276-1·468; p<0·0001) in type 2 diabetes. Among people with diabetes, adjusted for age, sex, and diabetes duration and type, those who developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were more likely to be male, live in residential care or a more deprived area, have a COVID-19 risk condition, retinopathy, reduced renal function, or worse glycaemic control, have had a diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycaemia hospitalisation in the past 5 years, be on more anti-diabetic and other medication (all p<0·0001), and have been a smoker (p=0·0011). The cross-validated predictive model of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes had a C-statistic of 0·85 (0·83-0·86). INTERPRETATION: Overall risks of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were substantially elevated in those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared with the background population. The risk of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19, and therefore the need for special protective measures, varies widely among those with diabetes but can be predicted reasonably well using previous clinical history.

S protein mediates the SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells. The ""fusion core"" of the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) on S plays a crucial role in the virus infectivity, as it is part of a key membrane fusion architecture. While SARS-CoV-2 was becoming a global threat, scientists have been accumulating data on the virus at an impressive pace, both in terms of genomic sequences and of three-dimensional structures. On 15 February 2021, from the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences in the GISAID resource, we collected 415,673 complete S protein sequences and identified all the mutations occurring in the HR1 fusion core. This is a 21-residue segment, which, in the post-fusion conformation of the protein, gives many strong interactions with the heptad repeat 2, bringing viral and cellular membranes in proximity for fusion. We investigated the frequency and structural effect of novel mutations accumulated over time in such a crucial region for the virus infectivity. Three mutations were quite frequent, occurring in over 0.1% of the total sequences. These were S929T, D936Y, and S949F, all in the N-terminal half of the HR1 fusion core segment and particularly spread in Europe and USA. The most frequent of them, D936Y, was present in 17% of sequences from Finland and 12% of sequences from Sweden. In the post-fusion conformation of the unmutated S protein, D936 is involved in an inter-monomer salt bridge with R1185. We investigated the effect of the D936Y mutation on the pre-fusion and post-fusion state of the protein by using molecular dynamics, showing how it especially affects the latter one.","Oliva, Romina; Shaikh, Abdul Rajjak; Petta, Andrea; Vangone, Anna; Cavallo, Luigi",Molecules (Basel),305,30

Our aim was to characterize imaging, lab, and clinical correlates of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leukoencephalopathy, which may provide insight into the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven consecutive patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 who had brain MR imaging following intensive care unit admission were included. Seven (7/27, 26%) developed an unusual pattern of ""leukoencephalopathy with reduced diffusivity"" on diffusion-weighted MR imaging. The remaining patients did not exhibit this pattern. Clinical and laboratory indices, as well as neuroimaging findings, were compared between groups. RESULTS: The reduced-diffusivity group had a significantly higher body mass index (36 versus 28 kg/m2, P < .01). Patients with reduced diffusivity trended toward more frequent acute renal failure (7/7, 100% versus 9/20, 45%; P = .06) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate values (49 versus 85 mL/min; P = .06) at the time of MRI. Patients with reduced diffusivity also showed lesser mean values of the lowest hemoglobin levels (8.1 versus 10.2 g/dL, P < .05) and higher serum sodium levels (147 versus 139 mmol/L, P = .04) within 24 hours before MR imaging. The reduced-diffusivity group showed a striking and highly reproducible distribution of confluent, predominantly symmetric, supratentorial, and middle cerebellar peduncular white matter lesions (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight notable correlations between severe COVID-19 leukoencephalopathy with reduced diffusivity and obesity, acute renal failure, mild hypernatremia, anemia, and an unusual brain MR imaging white matter lesion distribution pattern. Together, these observations may shed light on possible SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with leukoencephalopathy, including borderzone ischemic changes, electrolyte transport disturbances, and silent hypoxia in the setting of the known cytokine storm syndrome that accompanies severe COVID-19.","Rapalino, O; Pourvaziri, A; Maher, M; Jaramillo-Cardoso, A; Edlow, B L; Conklin, J; Huang, S; Westover, B; Romero, J M; Halpern, E; Gupta, R; Pomerantz, S; Schaefer, P; Gonzalez, R G; Mukerji, S S; Lev, M H",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,305,29

A scaled-up, cluster-RCT with over 3000 Danish school children aged 10-12 years old.",20.250048,2.428357,2021-01-28,"BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) function evaluation by echocardiography is key in the management of ICU patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), however, it remains challenging. Quantification of RV deformation by speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) is a recently available and reproducible technique that provides an integrated analysis of the RV. However, data are scarce regarding its use in critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to assess its feasibility and clinical usefulness in moderate–severe ARDS patients. RESULTS: Forty-eight ARDS patients under invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) were consecutively enrolled in a prospective observational study. A full transthoracic echocardiography was performed within 36 h of MV initiation. STE-derived and conventional parameters were recorded. Strain imaging of the RV lateral, inferior and septal walls was highly feasible (47/48 (98%) patients). Interobserver reproducibility of RV strain values displayed good reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) > 0.75 for all STE-derived parameters) in ARDS patients. ROC curve analysis showed that lateral, inferior, global (average of the 3 RV walls) longitudinal systolic strain (LSS) and global strain rate demonstrated significant diagnostic values when compared to several conventional indices (TAPSE, S′, RV FAC). A RV global LSS value > − 13.7% differentiated patients with a TAPSE < vs > 12 mm with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 83%. Regarding clinical outcomes, mortality and cumulative incidence of weaning from MV at day 28 were not different in patients with normal versus abnormal STE-derived parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Global STE assessment of the RV was highly achievable and reproducible in moderate–severe ARDS patients under MV and additionally correlated with several conventional parameters of RV function. In our cohort, STE-derived parameters did not provide any incremental value in terms of survival or weaning from MV prediction. Further investigations are needed to evaluate their theranostic usefulness.

TRIAL DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial with parallel assignment. Adults will be assigned either to daily use of a meditation app for 30 days or to a control group (no usage of meditation app) with a 1:1 equivalence allocation ratio. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion Criteria: Participants must be 18 or older, have a smartphone, able to download apps to their smartphone, must be fluent in the English language, able to complete surveys on their own, and must be in the United States for the duration of the study. Exclusion Criteria: Current regular use of a mindfulness or meditation app, regular practice of mindfulness or meditation, regular therapy sessions, inability to complete surveys independently, or any mental health restrictions that would prevent participation. All data will be collected through the Insight Timer Meditation App and Google Forms. This trial is being conducted through the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine in Erie, PA, with all data collected digitally. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: Participants will be sent a link to a pre-intervention survey prior to first use of the mindfulness app. Participants will be instructed to use the Insight Timer app for 10 minutes daily for 30 days. At the end of the 30-day intervention period, participants will be sent a link for the post-intervention survey. Two months after the conclusion of the 30-day intervention period, participants will be sent a link for another post-intervention survey. Comparator: Participants will receive the same surveys, but will not use any mindfulness app for the 30-day intervention period. After this 30-day period, participants are invited to use the Insight Timer app if they so choose. MAIN OUTCOMES: The main outcomes are (1) anxiety as assessed by survey questions adapted from the GAD7, comparing pre-intervention to post-30-days of app usage and (2) well-being as assessed by survey questions adapted from the WHO-5, comparing pre-intervention and post-30-days of app usage.

Monoclonal neutralizing antibodies are an important drug class in the global fight against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic due to their ability to convey immediate protection and their potential to be used as both prophylactic and therapeutic drugs. Clinically used neutralizing antibodies against respiratory viruses are currently injected intravenously, which can lead to suboptimal pulmonary bioavailability and thus to a lower effectiveness. Here we describe DZIF-10c, a fully human monoclonal neutralizing antibody that binds the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. DZIF-10c displays an exceptionally high neutralizing potency against SARS-CoV-2, retains full activity against the variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 and still neutralizes the VOC B.1.351, although with reduced potency. Importantly, not only systemic but also intranasal application of DZIF-10c abolished the presence of infectious particles in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected mice and mitigated lung pathology when administered prophylactically. Along with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, these results highlight DZIF-10c as a novel human SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody with high in vitro and in vivo antiviral potency. The successful intranasal application of DZIF-10c paves the way for clinical trials investigating topical delivery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Halwe, Sandro; Kupke, Alexandra; Vanshylla, Kanika; Liberta, Falk; Gruell, Henning; Zehner, Matthias; Rohde, Cornelius; Krähling, Verena; Gellhorn Serra, Michelle; Kreer, Christoph; Klüver, Michael; Sauerhering, Lucie; Schmidt, Jörg; Cai, Zheng; Han, Fei; Young, David; Yang, Guangwei; Widera, Marek; Koch, Manuel; Werner, Anke; Kämper, Lennart; Becker, Nico; Marlow, Michael S.; Eickmann, Markus; Ciesek, Sandra; Schiele, Felix; Klein, Florian; Becker, Stephan",Viruses,305,16

As SCV2 is related to previously-studied coronaviruses that have been shown to have the capability for brain invasion, it seems likely that SCV2 may be able to do so as well. To date, although there have been many clinical and autopsy-based reports that describe a broad range of SCV2-associated neurological conditions, it is unclear what fraction of these have been due to direct CNS invasion versus indirect effects caused by systemic reactions to critical illness. Still critically lacking is a comprehensive tissue-based survey of the CNS presence and specific neuropathology of SCV2 in humans. We conducted an extensive neuroanatomical survey of RT-PCR-detected SCV2 in 16 brain regions from 20 subjects who died of COVID-19 disease. Targeted areas were those with cranial nerve nuclei, including the olfactory bulb, medullary dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and the pontine trigeminal nerve nuclei, as well as areas possibly exposed to hematogenous entry, including the choroid plexus, leptomeninges, median eminence of the hypothalamus and area postrema of the medulla. Subjects ranged in age from 38 to 97 (mean 77) with 9 females and 11 males. Most subjects had typical age-related neuropathological findings. Two subjects had severe neuropathology, one with a large acute cerebral infarction and one with hemorrhagic encephalitis, that was unequivocally related to their COVID-19 disease while most of the 18 other subjects had non-specific histopathology including focal β-amyloid precursor protein white matter immunoreactivity and sparse perivascular mononuclear cell cuffing. Four subjects (20%) had SCV2 RNA in one or more brain regions including the olfactory bulb, amygdala, entorhinal area, temporal and frontal neocortex, dorsal medulla and leptomeninges. The subject with encephalitis was SCV2-positive in a histopathologically-affected area, the entorhinal cortex, while the subject with the large acute cerebral infarct was SCV2-negative in all brain regions. Like other human coronaviruses, SCV2 can inflict acute neuropathology in susceptible patients. Much remains to be understood, including what viral and host factors influence SCV2 brain invasion and whether it is cleared from the brain subsequent to the acute illness.","Serrano, Geidy E.; Walker, Jessica E.; Arce, Richard; Glass, Michael J.; Vargas, Daisy; Sue, Lucia I.; Intorcia, Anthony J.; Nelson, Courtney M.; Oliver, Javon; Papa, Jaclyn; Russell, Aryck; Suszczewicz, Katsuko E.; Borja, Claryssa I.; Belden, Christine; Goldfarb, Danielle; Shprecher, David; Atri, Alireza; Adler, Charles H.; Shill, Holly A.; Driver-Dunckley, Erika; Mehta, Shyamal H.; Readhead, Benjamin; Huentelman, Matthew J.; Peters, Joseph L.; Alevritis, Ellie; Bimi, Christian; Mizgerd, Joseph P.; Reiman, Eric M.; Montine, Thomas J.; Desforges, Marc; Zehnder, James L.; Sahoo, Malaya K.; Zhang, Haiyu; Solis, Daniel; Pinsky, Benjamin A.; Deture, Michael; Dickson, Dennis W.; Beach, Thomas G.",medRxiv,305,20

We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic decreased the frequency of pediatric fracture operations. We also hypothesized that the frequency of emergency pediatric surgical operations decreased as well, as a result of patient-related reasons, such as neglecting or underestimating the symptoms, to avoid hospital admission. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nationwide data were individually collected and analyzed in all five tertiary pediatric surgical/trauma centers in Finland. Operations related to fractures, appendicitis, and acute scrotum in children aged above 16 years between March 1 and May 31 from 2017 to 2020 were identified. The monthly frequencies of operations and type of traumas were compared between prepandemic 3 years and 2020. RESULTS: Altogether, 1755 patients were identified in five tertiary hospitals who had an emergency operation during the investigation period. There was a significant decrease (31%, p = 0.03) in trauma operations. It was mostly due to reduction in lower limb trauma operations (32%, p = 0.006). Daycare, school, and organized sports–related injuries decreased significantly during the pandemic. These reductions were observed in March and in April. The frequencies of appendectomies and scrotal explorations remained constant. CONCLUSION: According to the postulation, a great decrease in the need of trauma operations was observed during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic. In the future, in case similar public restrictions are ordered, the spared resources could be deployed to other clinical areas. However, the need of pediatric surgical emergencies held stable during the COVID-19 restrictions.","Raitio, A.; Ahonen, M.; Jääskelä, M.; Jalkanen, J.; Luoto, T.

It exhibits a broad spectrum of health-promoting and therapeutic activities. Together with baicalein, it is considered to be the one of main active ingredients of Chinese medicines for the management of COVID-19. However, therapeutic use of wogonin may be limited due to low market availability connected with its low content in baikal skullcap and lack of efficient preparative methods for obtaining this compound. Although the amount of wogonin in skullcap root often does not exceed 0.5%, this material is rich in wogonin glucuronide, which may be used as a substrate for wogonin production. In the present study, a rapid, simple, cheap and effective method of wogonin and baicalein preparation, which provides gram quantities of both flavonoids, is proposed. The obtained wogonin was used as a substrate for biotransformation. Thirty-six microorganisms were tested in screening studies. The most efficient were used in enlarged scale transformations to determine metabolism of this xenobiotic. The major phase I metabolism product was 4′-hydroxywogonin—a rare flavonoid which exhibits anticancer activity—whereas phase II metabolism products were glucosides of wogonin.

While its clinical manifestations have been extensively studied, its pathogenesis is not yet fully understood. A limited number of autopsy studies have revealed that the lungs and the immune system are the organs that sustain the most severe damage. Other organs affected include the kidneys, brain, digestive tract, heart, liver, thyroid gland and urogenital tract. The primary target cells are pneumocytes and enterocytes, both cell types abundantly expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which is the main SARS-CoV receptor. Other cell types infected include the epithelial cells of renal tubules, cerebral neurons, and immune cells. The pathology of this disease results from both direct and indirect injury. Direct injury is caused by infection of the target cells by the virus. Indirect injury mainly results from immune responses, circulatory dysfunction, and hypoxia. In this review, we summarize the major pathological findings at the gross, cellular and molecular levels and discuss the various possible mechanisms that may contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS.

As with SARS, MERS and now SARS-CoV-2, the origin and emergence of new variants are often attributed to events of recombination that alter host tropism or disease severity. In most cases, recombination has been detected by searches for excessively similar genomic regions in divergent strains; however, such analyses are complicated by the high mutation rates of RNA viruses, which can produce sequence similarities in distant strains by convergent mutations. By applying a genome-wide approach that examines the source of individual polymorphisms and that can be tested against null models in which recombination is absent and homoplasies can arise only by convergent mutations, we examine the extent and limits of recombination in Betacoronaviruses. We find that recombination accounts for nearly 40% of the polymorphisms circulating in populations and that gene exchange occurs almost exclusively among strains belonging to the same subgenus. Although experimental studies have shown that recombinational exchanges occur at random along the coronaviral genome, in nature, they are vastly overrepresented in regions controlling viral interaction with host cells.","Bobay, Louis-Marie; O’Donnell, Angela C.; Ochman, Howard",PLoS Genet,305,18

Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from 120 children (<5 years old) who were hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections between November 2010 and October 2011. The respiratory virus detection assay was performed using the PCR/ESI‐MS assay and the DFA. The discordant PCR/ESI‐MS and DFA results were resolved with RT‐PCR plus sequencing. The overall agreement for PCR/ESI‐MS and DFA was 98.3% (118/120). Compared with the results from DFA, the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR/ESI‐MS assay were 100% and 97.5%, respectively. The PCR/ESI‐MS assay also detected more multiple virus infections and revealed more detailed subtype information than DFA. Among the 12 original specimens with discordant results between PCR/ESI‐MS and DFA, 11 had confirmed PCR/ESI‐MS results. Thus, the PCR/ESI‐MS assay is a high‐throughput, sensitive, specific and promising method to detect and subtype conventional viruses in respiratory tract infections and allows rapid identification of mixed pathogens.

Abstract We are facing a pandemic that is going to affect a significant part of the population. At the end of April in the world there are about 3,000,000 cases, with 205,000 deaths and 860,000 patients recovered. The response to this pandemic has in many cases led to a significant change in the daily work of caring for cancer patients, the good results of which depend largely on time-adjusted protocols and multidisciplinary treatments. We present a review of local, surgical and radiotherapy treatment together with authors' recommendations made from personal experience on ways to act in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. The multidisciplinary Breast Committees must continue to meet weekly in videoconference format. All surgical actions and irradiations must be carried out with maximum safety for both the patients and the participating teams. Hypofractionation in radiation therapy should be the standard treatment. Sometimes it is recommended to apply a primary systemic treatment or even a primary irradiation. Great coordination between the surgical and oncology teams, both medical and radiotherapeutic, is essential.","Pardo, Ricardo; Algara, Manel; Montero-Fernández, María Angeles; Sanz, Xavier; Vernet, Mar; Rodríguez, Nuria; Andrés-Luna, Rogelio; Piñero, Antoni; Ciérvide, R.; Córdoba, Raúl; Montero, Ángel; Osorio, Irene; Argudo, Nuria; Salido, Sergio; Pritchard, Susan; Bernar, Juan; Rajiv, Dave; Alves, Natalia Frade; Nicolau, Pau; Orihuela, Pilar; Jiménez, Marta",,305,24

The lockdown measures to restrict the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the following unfavorable meteorology in Beijing provided a natural experiment to examine how air mercury responds to strict control measures when the climate becomes humid and warm. Based on a high-time resolution emission inventory and generalized additive model, we found that air mercury concentration responded almost linearly to the changes in mercury emissions when excluding the impact of other factors. Existing pollution control and additional lockdown measures reduced mercury emissions by 16.7 and 12.5 kg/d during lockdown, respectively, which correspondingly reduced the concentrations of atmospheric mercury by 0.10 and 0.07 ng/m3. Emission reductions from cement clinker production contributed to the largest decrease in atmospheric mercury, implying potential mitigation effects in this sector since it is currently the number one emitter in China. However, changes in meteorology raised atmospheric mercury by 0.41 ng/m3. The increases in relative humidity (9.5%) and temperature (1.2 °C) significantly offset the effect of emission reduction by 0.17 and 0.09 ng/m3, respectively, which highlights the challenge of air mercury control in humid and warm weather and the significance of understanding mercury behavior in the atmosphere and at atmospheric interfaces, especially the impact from relative humidity.","Wu, Qingru; Tang, Yi; Wang, Long; Wang, Shuxiao; Han, Deming; Ouyang, Daiwei; Jiang, Yueqi; Xu, Peng; Xue, Zhigang; Hu, Jingnan",Sci Total Environ,305,11

We aimed to describe the length and rate of ICU admission, and explore the clinical variables influencing ICU use, for COVID-19 patients with known cardiovascular diseases or their risk factors (CVDRF). Methods and Results: A post hoc analysis was performed of 693 Japanese COVID-19 patients with CVDRF enrolled in the nationwide CLAVIS-COVID registration system between January and May 2020 (mean [±SD] age 68.3±14.9 years; 35% female); 199 patients (28.7%) required ICU management. The mean (±SD) ICU length of stay (LOS) was 19.3±18.5 days, and the rate of in-hospital death and hospital LOS were significantly higher (P<0.001) and longer (P<0.001), respectively, in the ICU than non-ICU group. Logistic regression analysis revealed that clinical variables reflecting impaired general condition (e.g., high C-reactive protein, low Glasgow Coma Scale score, SpO(2), albumin level), male sex, and previous use of β-blockers) were associated with ICU admission (all P<0.001). Notably, age was inversely associated with ICU admission, and this was particularly prominent among elderly patients (OR 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.95–0.99; P=0.0018). Conclusions: One-third of COVID patients with CVDRF required ICU care during the first phase of the pandemic in Japan. Other than anticipated clinical variables, such as hypoxia and altered mental status, age was inversely associated with the use of the ICU, warranting further investigation.","Yoshida, Naofumi; Iwata, Sachiyo; Ogawa, Masato; Izawa, Kazuhiro P.; Kuroda, Shunsuke; Kohsaka, Shun; Yonetsu, Taishi; Kitai, Takeshi; Torii, Sho; Sano, Takahide; Sakai, Yoshitada; Yamashita, Tomoya; Hirata, Ken-ichi; Matsue, Yuya; Matsumoto, Shingo; Node, Koichi",Circulation reports,305,26

Case Mortality Rates (CMR) per 100,000 population are more reliable than case-fatality rates per 100 test-positive cases, which are heavily dependent on the extent of viral case testing carried out in a country. We aimed to study the variations in CMR against population risk factors such as aging, underlying chronic diseases and social determinants such as poverty and overcrowding. Data on COVID-19 CMR in 93 countries was analyzed for associations with preexisting prevalence rates of eight diseases [asthma, lung cancer, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), hypertension, ischemic heart disease, depression and diabetes], and six socio-demographic factors [Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, unemployment, age over 65 years, urbanization, population density, and socio-demographic index]. These data were analyzed in three steps: correlation analysis, bivariate comparison of countries, and multivariate modelling. Bivariate analysis revealed that COVID-19 CMR were higher in countries that had high prevalence of population risk factors such as AD, lung cancer, asthma and COPD. On multivariate modeling however, AD, COPD, depression and higher GDP predicted increased death rates. Comorbid illnesses such as AD and lung diseases may be more influential than aging alone.","Hashim, Muhammad Jawad; Alsuwaidi, Ahmed R.; Khan, Gulfaraz",J Epidemiol Glob Health,305,28

Conventional treatment methods have disadvantages; however, adsorption in biomass is a highly promising method with high efficiency and low cost that avoids many of the disadvantages of conventional methods. Black tea (BT) wastes and water hyacinth (WH) have attracted attention for their ability to remove heavy metals from wastewater. Utilizing these approaches can remove contaminants and effectively manage problematic invasive species and wastes. The conventional uses of BT and WH were efficient for removing heavy metals from wastewater.

METHODS: 14 pwMS with EDSS <4.0 and 13 age‐ and sex‐matched healthy controls completed a 12‐week in‐person PRT exercise intervention. Outcome measures included: plasma metabolomics analysis, cardiovascular fitness tests, EDSS, timed 25‐foot walk (T25FW), six‐minute walk test (6MWT), hip strength, and modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS). We identified changes in the metabolome with PRT intervention in both groups using individual metabolite abundance and weighted correlation network defined metabolite module eigenvalues and then examined correlations in changes in metabolite modules with changes in various clinical outcomes. RESULTS: In both groups PRT intervention improved hip strength, distance walked in 6WMT, speed of walking, while fatigue (MFIS) was improved in pwMS. Fatty acid, phospholipid, and sex steroid metabolism were significantly altered by PRT in pwMS but not in controls. Changes in fatigue (MFIS score) were strongly inversely correlated and hip strength was moderately correlated with change in sex steroid metabolite module in pwMS. A similar relationship was noted between change in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate abundance (sex steroid metabolite) and fatigue in pwMS. We also noted an inverse correlation between changes in fatty acid metabolism and cardiovascular fitness in pwMS. INTERPRETATION: PRT‐induced metabolic changes may underlie improved clinical parameters in pwMS and may warrant investigation as potential therapeutic targets in future studies.","Keller, Jennifer; Zackowski, Kathleen; Kim, Sol; Chidobem, Ikechukwu; Smith, Matthew; Farhadi, Farzaneh; Bhargava, Pavan",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,305,16

They provide several advantages over more traditional approaches to vaccine development, showing strong immunogenicity and an overall favorable safety profile. While preclinical testing has provided some key insights on how RNA vaccines interact with the innate immune system, their mechanism of action appears to be fragmented amid the literature, making it difficult to formulate new hypotheses to be tested in clinical settings and ultimately improve this technology platform. Here, we propose a systems biology approach, based on the combination of literature mining and mechanistic graphical modeling, to consolidate existing knowledge around mRNA vaccines mode of action and enhance the translatability of preclinical hypotheses into clinical evidence. A Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for automated knowledge extraction retrieved key biological evidences that were joined into an interactive mechanistic graphical model representing the chain of immune events induced by mRNA vaccines administration. The achieved mechanistic graphical model will help the design of future experiments, foster the generation of new hypotheses and set the basis for the development of mathematical models capable of simulating and predicting the immune response to mRNA vaccines.","Leonardelli, Lorena; Lofano, Giuseppe; Selvaggio, Gianluca; Parolo, Silvia; Giampiccolo, Stefano; Tomasoni, Danilo; Domenici, Enrico; Priami, Corrado; Song, Haifeng; Medini, Duccio; Marchetti, Luca; Siena, Emilio",Front Immunol,305,1

DESIGN: Instrumental variables analysis relying on variation in state SNAP policies to isolate exogenous variation in household SNAP participation. SETTING: Nationally representative data on child and adult health from the 2008 to 2013 National Health Interview Survey. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 92 237 adults and 45 469 children who were either eligible for SNAP based on household income and state eligibility rules or were low income but not eligible for SNAP benefits. RESULTS: For adults, SNAP participation increased the probability of reporting very good or excellent health, and for both adults and children, reduced needing but having to go without dental care or eyeglasses. The size of these benefits was especially pronounced for children. However, SNAP participation increased the probability of needing but not being able to afford prescription medicine, and increased psychological distress for adults and behavioural problems for children under age 10. CONCLUSIONS: SNAP's benefits for adult health and improved access to dental and vision care for adults and children suggest benefits from the program's expansions during the current COVID-induced crisis. Predicted negative effects of SNAP participation suggest the need for attention to program and benefit structure to avoid harm and the need for continued research to explore the causal effects of program participation.","Miller, Daniel P; Morrissey, Taryn W",Public Health Nutr,305,32

The genome of these IBVs varies in size from 27596 bp to 27790 bp. Most IBV strains have the typical genomic organization of other gamacoronaviruses, however, two strains lacked 3a and 5b genes as a result of a nucleotide change within the start codon in the 3a or 5b genes. Analysis of our 110 viruses revealed that recombination events may be responsible for the emergence of the LX4 genotype with different topologies. Most of these viruses disappeared (before mid-2005) because they were not “fit” to adaptation in chickens. Finally, those of the “fit” viruses (after mid-2005) continued to evolve and have become widespread and predominant in commercial poultry. In addition, few of these viruses experienced recombination with those of the vaccine strains at the 3′ end of the genome.","Zhao, Wenjun; Gao, Mengying; Xu, Qianqian; Xu, Yang; Zhao, Yan; Chen, Yuqiu; Zhang, Tingting; Wang, Qiuling; Han, Zongxi; Li, Huixin; Chen, Lingfeng; Liang, Shuling; Shao, Yuhao; Liu, Shengwang",Vet Microbiol,305,5

It was soon discovered that the disease was caused by a novel coronavirus designated as SARS-CoV-2, and the disease was thus abbreviated to COVID-19 (COVID). The global medical community has directed its efforts not only to find effective therapies against the deadly pathogen but also to combat the concomitant complications. Two of the most common respiratory manifestations of COVID are a significant reduction in the diffusing capacity of the lungs (DLCO) and the associated pulmonary interstitial damage. One year after moderate COVID, the incidence rate of impaired DLCO and persistent lung damage still exceeds 30%, and one-third of the patients have severe DLCO impairment and fibrotic lung damage. The persistent respiratory complications may cause substantial population morbidity, long-term disability, and even death due to the lung fibrosis progression. The incidence of COVID-induced pulmonary fibrosis caused by COVID can be estimated based on a 15-year observational study of lung pathology after SARS. Most SARS patients with fibrotic lung damage recovered within the first year and then remained healthy; however, in 20% of the cases, significant fibrosis progression was found in 5–10 years. Based on these data, the incidence rate of post-COVID lung fibrosis can be estimated at 2–6% after moderate illness. What is worse, there are reasons to believe that fibrosis may become one of the major long-term complications of COVID, even in asymptomatic individuals. Currently, despite the best efforts of the global medical community, there are no treatments for COVID-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we analyze the latest data from ongoing clinical trials aimed at treating post-COVID lung fibrosis and analyze the rationale for the current drug candidates. We discuss the use of antifibrotic therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the IN01 vaccine, glucocorticosteroids as well as the stromal vascular fraction for the treatment and rehabilitation of patients with COVID-associated pulmonary damage.","Bazdyrev, Evgeny; Rusina, Polina; Panova, Maria; Novikov, Fedor; Grishagin, Ivan; Nebolsin, Vladimir",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),305,21

Results 13 out of 145 (9.0%) COVID-19 patients were confirmed re-positivity of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR test. The median interval between disease onset to recurrence was 38 days. SARS-CoV-2 re-positive cases were of significantly longer virus shedding duration, notably higher body temperature, heart rate and lower TNF-α and IgG levels on admission. Covariate logistic regression analysis revealed virus shedding duration and IgG levels are independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 return positive after discharge.

In this paper, we have evaluated the effects of obesity, a condition associated with chronic systemic inflammation, on the secretion of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in the blood of COVID-19 patients. Results have shown that SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are negatively associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in COVID-19 obese patients, as expected based on the known effects of obesity on humoral immunity. Antibodies in COVID-19 obese patients are also negatively associated with serum levels of pro-inflammatory and metabolic markers of inflammaging and pulmonary inflammation, such as SAA (serum amyloid A protein), CRP (C-reactive protein) and ferritin, but positively associated with NEFA (nonesterified fatty acids).

Lung transplant recipients are frequently exposed to respiratory viruses and are particularly at risk for severe complications. The aim of this study was to assess the association among the presence of a respiratory virus detected by molecular assays in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, respiratory symptoms, and acute rejection in adult lung transplant recipients. Methods. Upper (nasopharyngeal swab) and lower (BAL) respiratory tract specimens from 77 lung transplant recipients enrolled in a cohort study and undergoing bronchoscopy with BAL and transbronchial biopsies were screened using 17 different polymerase chain reaction—based assays. Results. BAL fluid and biopsy specimens from 343 bronchoscopic procedures performed in 77 patients were analyzed. We also compared paired nasopharyngeal and BAL fluid specimens collected in a subgroup of 283 cases. The overall viral positivity rate was 29.3% in the upper respiratory tract specimens and 17.2% in the BAL samples (P < .001). We observed a significant association between the presence of respiratory symptoms and positive viral detection in the lower respiratory tract (P = .012). Conversely, acute rejection was not associated with the presence of viral infection (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.20–0.88). The recovery of lung function was significantly slower when acute rejection and viral infection were both present. Conclusions. A temporal relationship exists between acute respiratory symptoms and positive viral nucleic acid detection in BAL fluid from lung transplant recipients. We provide evidence suggesting that respiratory viruses are not associated with acute graft rejection during the acute phase of infection.","Soccal, P.

Most previous studies considered one-way trips, either getting ambulances to patients or transporting patients to hospitals. This research assesses spatiotemporal access to EMS at the shequ (the smallest administrative unit) level in Wuhan, China, attempting to fill a gap in literature by considering and comparing both trips in the evaluation of EMS access. METHODS: Two spatiotemporal access measures are adopted here: the proximity-based travel time obtained from online map services and the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E-2SFCA) which is a gravity-based model. First, the travel time is calculated for the two trips involved in one EMS journey: one is from the nearest EMS station to the scene (i.e. scene time interval (STI)) and the other is from the scene to the nearest hospital (i.e. transport time interval (TTI)). Then, the predicted travel time is incorporated into the E-2SFCA model to calculate the access measure considering the availability of the service provider as well as the population in need. For both access measures, the calculation is implemented for peak hours and off-peak hours. RESULTS: Both methods showed a marked decrease in EMS access during peak traffic hours, and differences in spatial patterns of ambulance and hospital access. About 73.9% of shequs can receive an ambulance or get to the nearest hospital within 10 min during off-peak periods, and this proportion decreases to about 45.5% for peak periods. Most shequs with good ambulance access but poor hospital access are in the south of the study area. In general, the central areas have better ambulance, hospital and overall access than peripheral areas, particularly during off-peak periods. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the impact of peak traffic periods on EMS access, we found that good ambulance access does not necessarily guarantee good hospital access nor the overall access, and vice versa.","Luo, Weicong; Yao, Jing; Mitchell, Richard; Zhang, Xiaoxiang",Int J Health Geogr,305,1

While theoretically effective, this policy places a substantial social and economic burden on both the individual and wider society, which might result in low adherence and reduced policy effectiveness. We aimed to assess the merit of testing contacts to avert onward transmission and to replace or reduce the length of quarantine for uninfected contacts. METHODS: We used an agent-based model to simulate the viral load dynamics of exposed contacts, and their potential for onward transmission in different quarantine and testing strategies. We compared the performance of quarantines of differing durations, testing with either PCR or lateral flow antigen (LFA) tests at the end of quarantine, and daily LFA testing without quarantine, against the current 14-day quarantine strategy. We also investigated the effect of contact tracing delays and adherence to both quarantine and self-isolation on the effectiveness of each strategy. FINDINGS: Assuming moderate levels of adherence to quarantine and self-isolation, self-isolation on symptom onset alone can prevent 37% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 12–56) of onward transmission potential from secondary cases. 14 days of post-exposure quarantine reduces transmission by 59% (95% UI 28–79). Quarantine with release after a negative PCR test 7 days after exposure might avert a similar proportion (54%, 95% UI 31–81; risk ratio [RR] 0·94, 95% UI 0·62–1·24) to that of the 14-day quarantine period, as would quarantine with a negative LFA test 7 days after exposure (50%, 95% UI 28–77; RR 0·88, 0·66–1·11) or daily testing without quarantine for 5 days after tracing (50%, 95% UI 23–81; RR 0·88, 0·60–1·43) if all tests are returned negative. A stronger effect might be possible if individuals isolate more strictly after a positive test and if contacts can be notified faster. INTERPRETATION: Testing might allow for a substantial reduction in the length of, or replacement of, quarantine with a small excess in transmission risk. Decreasing test and trace delays and increasing adherence will further increase the effectiveness of these strategies. Further research is required to empirically evaluate the potential costs (increased transmission risk, false reassurance) and benefits (reduction in the burden of quarantine, increased adherence) of such strategies before adoption as policy.

The current study screened major depression in people with epilepsy (PWE) during the epidemic of the novel coronavirus‐related disease COVID‐19, in order to identify whether the outbreak generated negative psychological impact on PWE. Methods. A Chinese version of the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (C‐NDDI‐E), a self‐reporting depression inventory, was applied for rapid detection of major depression. Assessment was carried out online during three different periods (prior to, during, and after the outbreak of COVID‐19), with the aim of identifying changes in prevalence of depression and associated risk factors. Results. A total of 158 PWE were recruited into the study (48.7% female). The questionnaire completion rates were 94.3% and 70.9% during and after the outbreak, respectively. The prevalence of depression prior to the epidemic, as the baseline, was 34.8% and increased to 42.3% during the period of the epidemic. Towards the end of the outbreak, the prevalence declined towards the baseline (36.6%). Factors such as living alone (OR = 4.022, 95% CI: 1.158‐13.971, P = 0.028) and active seizures before the epidemic (OR = 2.993, 95% CI: 1.197‐7.486, P = 0.019) were associated with depression during the epidemic. Monotherapy appeared to be protective against depression (OR = 0. 105, 95% CI: 0.047‐0.235, P <0.001). Significance. Our results suggest that the pandemic exerts negative influence on PWE's mental health.

Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT scans faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT scans. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on a COVID-19 infection dataset demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art","Fan, D.-P.; Zhou, T.; Ji, G.-P.; Zhou, Y.; Chen, G.; Fu, H.; Shen, J.; Shao, L.",,305,16

Vaccine development against this pathogen has been delayed after the detrimental effects produced in children by vaccination with a formalin-inactivated hRSV preparation (FI-hRSV), which caused enhanced disease upon natural viral infection. Since then, several studies have focused on understanding the mechanisms underlying such disease exacerbation. Along these lines, several studies have suggested that antibodies elicited by immunization with FI-hRSV show low neutralizing capacity and promote the formation of immune complexes containing hRSV (hRSV-ICs), which contribute to hRSV pathogenesis through the engagement of Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) expressed on the surface of immune cells. Furthermore, a role for FcγRs is supported by studies evaluating the contribution of these molecules to hRSV-induced disease. These studies have shown that FcγRs can modulate viral clearance by the host and the inflammatory response triggered by hRSV infection. In addition, ICs can facilitate viral entry into host cells expressing FcγRs, thus extending hRSV infectivity. In this article, we discuss current knowledge relative to the contribution of hRSV-ICs and FcγRs to the pathogenesis caused by hRSV and their putative role in the exacerbation of the disease caused by this virus after FI-hRSV vaccination. A better understanding FcγRs involvement in the immune response against hRSV will contribute to the development of new prophylactic or therapeutic tools to promote virus clearance with limited inflammatory damage to the airways.","Acevedo, Orlando A.; Díaz, Fabián E.; Beals, Tomas E.; Benavente, Felipe M.; Soto, Jorge A.; Escobar-Vera, Jorge; González, Pablo A.; Kalergis, Alexis M.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,305,17

This may increase complications for patients with acute viral respiratory infections. UGT1A1 and CYP2D6 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of atazanavir and fluvoxamine repurposed for COVID-19. This study aimed to elucidate the role of interethnic variation in these enzymes in the efficacy of repurposed drug therapies. A retrospective cohort of 101 Jordanian Arab samples were genotyped using Affymetrix DMET Plus Premier Package. Comprehensive global population genetic structure analyses were performed for CYP2D6 and UGT1A1 allele frequencies across multi-ethnic populations of over 131,000 global subjects from 417 published reports, revealing that Jordanian Arabs share the closest sequence homology to European and Near East populations. The East Asian populations have significantly over-representaiton of individuals with diplotype pairs for reduced atazanavir metabolism compared to the African populations and are more likely to show impaired UGT1A1 metabolism. East Asian populations are also 4.4x more likely to show impaired fluvoxamine metabolism than South Central Asian and Oceanian populations, and 8x more likely than other ancestry populations.

Thus, it is generally well-adapted viruses, infecting many of us without doing much harm, and with the capacity to hide in our neurons for life. In rare situations, however, the primary infection becomes generalized or involves the brain. Normally, the primary HSV infection is asymptomatic, and a crucial element in the early restriction of virus replication and thus avoidance of symptoms from the infection is the concerted action of different arms of the innate immune response. An early and light struggle inhibiting some HSV replication will spare the host from the real war against huge amounts of virus later in infection. As far as such a war will jeopardize the life of the host, it will be in both interests, including the virus, to settle the conflict amicably. Some important weapons of the unspecific defence and the early strikes and beginning battle during the first days of a HSV infection are discussed in this review. Generally, macrophages are orchestrating a multitude of anti-herpetic actions during the first hours of the attack. In a first wave of responses, cytokines, primarily type I interferons (IFN) and tumour necrosis factor are produced and exert a direct antiviral effect and activate the macrophages themselves. In the next wave, interleukin (IL)-12 together with the above and other cytokines induce production of IFN-γ in mainly NK cells. Many positive feed-back mechanisms and synergistic interactions intensify these systems and give rise to heavy antiviral weapons such as reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. This results in the generation of an alliance against the viral enemy. However, these heavy weapons have to be controlled to avoid too much harm to the host. By IL-4 and others, these reactions are hampered, but they are still allowed in foci of HSV replication, thus focusing the activity to only relevant sites. So, no hero does it alone. Rather, an alliance of cytokines, macrophages and other cells seems to play a central role. Implications of this for future treatment modalities are shortly considered.","Ellermann-Eriksen, Svend",Virol J,305,20

The patients' self-reports of sleep quality was assessed using the Richards–Campbell Sleep Questionnaire at 0 and 24 h after inclusion. The demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected and compared between the good sleep group and poor sleep group. We found that 2 consecutive days of SD decreased the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and ALC recovery at 3 days after SD. Furthermore, post-septic poor sleep decreased the plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) immediately after 2 consecutive days of SD. The ANP levels at 24 h after inclusion were positively correlated with ALC recovery, the number of CD3(+) T cells, or the number of CD3(+) CD4(+) cells in the peripheral blood on day 5 after inclusion. Our data suggested that very-short-term poor sleep quality could slow down lymphocyte recovery over the following few days in septic patients who were recovering from a critical illness.

Africa was disproportionately affected, where 67% of total CEs, 67% of ‘Both’ events (CE and ND), and 46% of all outbreaks occurred for the study period. The odds ratio of a vaccine-preventable outbreak occurring in a CE versus an ND was 4.14 (95% confidence limits 1.9, 9.4). CONCLUSIONS: CEs had greater odds of being associated with outbreaks compared with NDs. Moreover, CEs had high odds of a vaccine-preventable disease causing that outbreak. Focusing on better vaccine coverage could reduce CE-associated morbidity and mortality by preventing outbreaks from spreading.","Culver, Amanda; Rochat, Roger; Cookson, Susan T.",Confl Health,305,30

In the UK, one in four people experience a gastrointestinal infection each year and epidemiological research highlights inequalities in the burden of disease. Specifically, poorer children are at greater risk of infection and the consequences of illness, such as symptom severity and time off work/school, are greater for less privileged groups of all ages. Gastrointestinal infections are, however, largely ‘hidden’ within the home and little is known about the lived experience and practices surrounding these illnesses, how they vary across contrasting socioeconomic contexts, or how inequalities in the disease burden across socioeconomic groups might come about. This paper presents data from an ethnographic study which illuminate how socioeconomic inequalities in the physical and material management and consequences of gastrointestinal infections are generated in families with young children. The study shows how the ‘work’ needed to manage gastrointestinal infections is more laborious for people living in more ‘disadvantaged’ conditions, exacerbated by: more overcrowded homes with fewer washing and toilet facilities; inflexible employment; low household incomes; and higher likelihood of co-morbidities which can be made worse by having a gastrointestinal infection. Our findings call into question the current approach to prevention of gastrointestinal infections which tend to focus almost exclusively on individual behaviours, which are not adapted to reflect differences in socioeconomic context. Public health agencies should also consider how wider social, economic and policy contexts shape inequalities in the management and consequences of illness. Our findings are also pertinent to the COVID-19 pandemic response in the UK. They highlight how research and policy approaches to acute infectious diseases need to take into consideration the differing lived experiences of contrasting households if they wish to address (and avoid exacerbating) inequalities in the future.","Rotheram, Suzanne; Cooper, Jessie; Barr, Ben; Whitehead, Margaret",Soc Sci Med,305,13

The chemical specificity and signal amplification of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) could be advantageous for developing a quantitative assay for SARS-CoV-2 with improved speed and accuracy over current testing methods. Here, we have tackled the challenges associated with SERS detection of viruses. As viruses are large, multicomponent species, they can yield different SERS signals, but also other abundant biomolecules present in the sample can generate undesired signals. To improve selectivity in complex biological environments, we have employed peptides as capture probes for viral proteins and developed an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mimetic peptide-based SERS sensor for SARS-CoV-2. The unique vibrational signature of the spike protein bound to the peptide-modified surface is identified and used to construct a multivariate calibration model for quantification. The sensor demonstrates a 300 nM limit of detection and high selectivity in the presence of excess bovine serum albumin. This work provides the basis for designing a SERS-based assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 as well as engineering SERS biosensors for other viruses in the future.","Payne, Taylor D.; Klawa, Stephen J.; Jian, Tengyue; Kim, Sang Hoon; Papanikolas, Micah J.; Freeman, Ronit; Schultz, Zachary D.",ACS Sens,305,28

DESIGN: A cross‐sectional survey. METHODS: Clinical nurses were conveniently recruited by an online link in three provinces out of Hubei, including Hunan (Central south), Chongqing (Southwest) and Xinjiang (Northwest) during 4‐10 February 2020. A structured questionnaire was distributed by an online investigation system. Information on sociodemographic characteristics, willingness, possible influencing factors (previous experience, health status, training conditions, perceptions on volunteering to practice in Hubei, family attitude and insurance) were collected. Binary logistic regression was conducted to explore the association of different factors with the willingness decision of nurses. RESULTS: A total of 11,183 nurses participated in this survey and a high proportion of them were willing to volunteer to practice in Hubei combating the epidemic. Nurses who were likely to volunteer had the following characteristics: younger, unmarried, members of the Communist Party of China, with senior professional qualification, working in critical care departments, with support from their families, with adequate training and learning, with good health status and low levels of anxiety. The regression model could explain 31.1% of the variances of the willingness decision of nurses. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of nurses in China were willing to practice in Hubei during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. Adequate training and psychological support would facilitate nurses to volunteer during the outbreak of an infectious disease. IMPACT: The study identified a high proportion of nurses in China were willing to to practice in Hubei combating the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. The findings will provide valuable references for nurses and decision makers to formulate better plans for increasing nursing workforce during such kind of public health crisis.","Gan, Xiaoqing; Shi, Zeya; Ying Chair, Sek; Cao, Xi; Wang, Qun",J Adv Nurs,305,21

METHODS: We conducted a pooled analysis of two prospective cohort studies. The outcomes of interest were in-hospital pulmonary embolism or lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (PE-LDVT), in-hospital nonleg deep vein thrombosis (NLDVT), and 90-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between predefined baseline prognostic factors and PE-LDVT or NLDVT. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between PE-LDVT or NLDVT and 90-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 2208 patients were included. The prevalence of any venous thromboembolism during 3 months before ICU admission was 3.6% (95% CI 2.8–4.4%). Out of 2166 patients, 47 (2.2%; 95% CI 1.6–2.9%) developed PE-LDVT and 38 patients (1.8%; 95% CI 1.2–2.4%) developed NLDVT. Renal replacement therapy (OR 3.5 95% CI 1.4–8.6), respiratory failure (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.1–3.8), and previous VTE (OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.7–7.7) were associated with PE-LDVT. Central venous catheters (OR 5.4; 95% CI 1.7–17.8) and infection (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.1–4.3) were associated with NLDVT. Occurrence of PE-LDVT but not NLDVT was associated with increased 90-day mortality (HR 2.7; 95% CI 1.6–4.6, respectively, 0.92; 95% CI 0.41–2.1). CONCLUSION: Thrombotic events are common in critically ill patients, both before and after ICU admittance. Development of PE-LDVT but not NLDVT was associated with increased mortality. Prognostic factors for developing PE-LDVT or NLDVT despite prophylaxis can be identified at ICU admission and may be used to select patients at higher risk in future randomized clinical trials.

The surface of the coatings was activated by using ArF excimer laser emitting ultraviolet radiation (λ = 193 nm) using different number of laser pulses and their fluence. The effects of surface activation and metallization were evaluated mainly based on optical and scanning electron microcopies (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that the presence of glass microspheres enabled the reduction in copper complex content, intensified the ablation process (higher cone-like structures created) and resulted in higher content of copper metallic seeds. On the other hand, the glass microspheres concentration, which was higher for lower size microspheres, was advantageous for obtaining a fully metallized layer.","Rytlewski, Piotr; Jagodziński, Bartłomiej; Malinowski, Rafał; Budner, Bogusław; Moraczewski, Krzysztof; Wojciechowska, Agnieszka; Augustyn, Piotr",Molecules,305,2

METHODS: The patients with nAMD having IVI appointments between March 16 and June 1, 2020 (RP in Turkey) were included in this retrospective study. For adherence analysis, the patients who attended (Group 1, n = 44) and who did not attend (Group 2, n = 60) their IVI appointment visits during the RP (V(RP)) were evaluated according to their last visit before the RP (V(0)). For outcome analysis, the patients who attend V(RP) and have follow-up (Group 1a, 46 eyes) and who did not attend V(RP) but later attended for follow-up (Group 2a, 33 eyes) were evaluated for functional (best-corrected visual acuity, BCVA [logMAR]) and anatomical (optical coherence tomography [OCT] disease activity) outcomes at the first visit after RP (V(1)) and last visit within six months after RP (V(2)). Patients received a complete ophthalmologic evaluation with anti-VEGF (Aflibercept) IVI administration at all visits. RESULTS: The adherence rate of the patients to V(RP) was 42.3% (44/104). The patients in Group 1 were significantly younger (mean ± SD years, 71.0 ± 8.1 vs. 74.7 ± 8.0, p = 0.024), had better median [IQR] BCVA at their first presentation (0.30 [0.54] vs. 0.61 [1.08], p = 0.023) and V(0) (0.40 [0.48] vs. 0.52 [0.70], p = 0.031), and had less hypertension (36.4% vs. 58.3%, p = 0.044) than Group 2. The mean ± SD delay of planned IVI at V(RP) in Group 2a was 13.9 ± 6.2 weeks. Disease activity in OCT was significantly higher in Group 2a than Group 1a at V(1) (60.6% vs. 32.6%, p = 0.025). In Group 2a, the median (IQR) BCVA was significantly worse at V(1) (0.70 [0.58]) and V(2) (0.70 [0.59]) than V(0) (0.52 [0.40], p = 0.047 and p = 0.035, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the scheduled nAMD patients in TAE protocol missed their IVI visits during the RP, which resulted in a delay of their treatments. The delay of IVI treatment in those patients resulted in an increase in OCT disease activity and a decrease in BCVA.","Sevik, Mehmet Orkun; Aykut, Aslan; Özkan, Gamze; Dericioğlu, Volkan; Şahin, Özlem",Int Ophthalmol,305,1

Its clinical course in most cases is monophasic; however, relapsing ADEM is rarely seen, which poses a diagnostic challenge for distinguishing this disease from multiple sclerosis (MS). Although typically encountered in children, it also occurs in adults with disease characteristics slightly different from the pediatric cases. Formerly, ADEM occurred particularly often in children with measles. However, the illness most often follows a non-descript viral or even bacterial infectious illness. ADEM occurs throughout the world, and may even be more common in less-developed countries, where MS is rare, than in developed ones, where MS is common. Children seldom get MS as opposed to adults, indicating that ADEM constitutes a distinct entity from MS. The prognosis of ADEM is generally good, but severe neurologic sequelae after ADEM are occasionally seen.

Conventional methods using reported incidence are unable to provide R t timely due to the delay from infection to reporting. Here, we aim to develop a framework to predict the R t in real-time using timely accessible data, i.e., human mobility, temperature, and risk awareness. Methods A linear regression model to predict R t was designed and embedded in the renewal process. Four prefectures of Japan with high incidence in the first wave were selected for model fitting and validation. Predictive performance was assessed by comparing the observed and predicted incidence using cross-validation, by testing on a separate dataset in two other prefectures with distinct geographical settings from the four prefectures. Results The predicted mean values of R t and 95% uncertainty intervals well traced the overall trend of incidence, while predictive performance was diminished when R t abruptly changed potentially due to superspreading events and when stringent countermeasures were implemented. Conclusions The described model can potentially be used for monitoring the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 ahead of the formal estimates subject to delay, providing essential information for timely planning and assessment of countermeasures.","Jung, Sung-mok; Endo, Akira; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.; Nishiura, Hiroshi",Int J Infect Dis,305,21

Due to the rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, many health care systems are at risk of exceeding their health care capacities, in particular in terms of SARS-CoV-2 tests, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and mechanical ventilators. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on health care systems by identifying those who are most likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, be hospitalized, or admitted to the ICU. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop, study, and evaluate clinical predictive models that estimate, using machine learning and based on routinely collected clinical data, which patients are likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or require hospitalization or intensive care. METHODS: Using a systematic approach to model development and optimization, we trained and compared various types of machine learning models, including logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, and gradient boosting. To evaluate the developed models, we performed a retrospective evaluation on demographic, clinical, and blood analysis data from a cohort of 5644 patients. In addition, we determined which clinical features were predictive to what degree for each of the aforementioned clinical tasks using causal explanations. RESULTS: Our experimental results indicate that our predictive models identified patients that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a priori at a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI 67%-81%) and a specificity of 49% (95% CI 46%-51%), patients who are SARS-CoV-2 positive that require hospitalization with 0.92 area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC; 95% CI 0.81-0.98), and patients who are SARS-CoV-2 positive that require critical care with 0.98 AUC (95% CI 0.95-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that predictive models trained on routinely collected clinical data could be used to predict clinical pathways for COVID-19 and, therefore, help inform care and prioritize resources.","Schwab, Patrick; DuMont Schütte, August; Dietz, Benedikt; Bauer, Stefan",J Med Internet Res,305,26

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted an online survey to assess the prevalence and clinical characteristics of PPEAH. The survey was voluntary, anonymous and addressed to medical and non-medical personnel. We used descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariate comparative analyses to identify factors associated with the development of PPEAH and its impact on work capacity. RESULTS: Out of 886 respondents, 88% (780) reported wearing PPE. Most of them were physicians (81%), 52.4% of whom were women. The prevalence of PPEAH was 65.5% (511/780) and 73.8% (377/511) were de novo headaches. PPEAH was acute, oppressive, bifrontal and of moderate intensity, and subsided with the removal of the PPE. Accompanying symptoms were common, and migraine and/or dysautonomic features were highly prevalent. Female sex, age > 40 years, use of PPE > 6 hours/day and the combination of an N95 mask and goggles were associated with the occurrence of PPEAH. There were factors associated with a negative impact on the ability to work because of the PPEAH. DISCUSSION: PPEAH may be a form of external compression headache (ECH); however, it has distinctive features that overlap with other primary and/or secondary headache disorders. CONCLUSIONS: PPEAH is prevalent and impacts on work-related activities. One subgroup presents characteristics not previously described in ECH.","Marfil-Rivera, A; Marfil-Garza, B A; Fernández-Garza, L E",Rev Neurol,305,9

Many patients at risk for severe COVID-19 manifestation have been identified as those with pre-existing conditions of pulmonary origin, as well as conditions which impair appropriate immune response, such as obesity. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe the manifestation, clinical course, and inflammatory biomarker milieu of COVID-19 in patients with obesity. SETTING: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 600 COVID-19 positive patients were stratified by World Health Organization (WHO) obesity class and their presenting symptoms, disease biomarkers, demographics, and outcomes [intubation rate, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of stay (LOS), mortality)] were investigated. RESULTS: Age was inversely related to obesity class; patients of obesity class III presented 12.9 years younger than patients of normal weight (p<0.0001). Initial ferritin lab values were negatively correlated with increasing obesity class (p=0.0192). Normal or near-normal lymphocyte profile was noted in patients with obesity compared to patients without obesity (p=0.0017). Patients with obesity had an increased rate of ICU admission (p=0.0215), increased length of stay (p=0.0004), but no differences in intubation rate (p=0.3705) or mortality (p=0.2486). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with obesity were more likely to present to the hospital at a younger age, with reduced levels of COVID-19 related biomarker disturbances, increased LOS and ICU admission rates, though were not at increased risk for mortality.","Le Guen, Claire L.; King, Neil A.; Zhao, Huaqing; Renza-Stingone, Elizabeth P.; Gerhard, Glenn S.; Soans, Rohit S.",Surg Obes Relat Dis,305,26

METHODS: This was a cross‐sectional study of subjects aged 0 to 17 years with JDM enrolled to the CLR from 2010 to 2015. Access to care was measured by calculating the distance from the subject zip code of residence to the treating pediatric rheumatology center and determining the state density of pediatric rheumatologists based on the 2015 American College of Rheumatology Workforce Study. Delay was categorized as early (<30 days), typical (1‐3 months), moderate (3‐12 months), and severe (>12 months). Ordered generalized additive models were used to determine the association between these measures and diagnostic delays. RESULTS: The median time to diagnosis was 3.1 months; 37.2% of patients experienced moderate delays, and 14.6% experienced severe delays. In a univariate analysis, younger age of disease onset and male sex were associated with delays. Using a generalized additive model accounting for age, sex, race, and ethnicity, increasing distance from treating pediatric rheumatologist and younger age at disease onset were associated with diagnostic delay. There was no association between the state density of rheumatologists and diagnostic delays in this model. CONCLUSION: In the CLR, we found moderate to severe diagnostic delays in the majority of subjects with JDM. Our data suggest that access to care, measured as the distance traveled to treating rheumatologist, is an important factor associated with delays in care but also highlight age as a contributing factor, suggesting that JDM may be less recognizable in young children.","Neely, Jessica; Shalen, Julia; Sturrock, Hugh; Kim, Susan",ACR Open Rheumatol,305,28

The World Health Organization declared it a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and called for collaborative efforts, such as contact tracing and promoting the public awareness about COVID-19, and recommended prevention and control measures. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of telephone counselling on the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAPs) of contacts of COVID-19 confirmed cases towards COVID-19 epidemiology and infection prevention and control measures. SETTING: Ten areas in Sharkia Governorate, Egypt divided into six rural and four urban areas. METHODS: A non-randomised controlled trial was conducted in Sharkia Governorate, Egypt, from 26 March 2020 to 12 April 2020 on 208 contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases, divided equally into two groups: an experiment group that was exposed to telephone counselling by the researchers and a control group that was exposed to routine surveillance by local health authority. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to assess the KAP of both groups towards COVID-19 before and after intervention. RESULTS: After intervention the percent of contacts who achieved good knowledge, positive attitudes and better practice scores in the experimental group was 91.3%, 57.8% and 71.2%, respectively, compared with 13.5%, 7.8% and 16.3%, respectively, in the control group. Male gender and working group were significantly associated with bad practice score.

One way to alleviate the problem might be to use prioritisation methods for patients on the waiting list and a wide range of research is available on such methods. However, significant variations and inconsistencies have been reported in prioritisation protocols from various specialties, institutions, and health systems. To bridge the evidence gap in existing literature, this comprehensive systematic review will synthesise global evidence on policy strategies with a unique insight to patient prioritisation methods to reduce waiting times for elective surgeries. This will provide evidence that might help with the tremendous burden of surgical disease that is now apparent in many countries because of operations that were delayed or cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and inform policy for sustainable healthcare management systems. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, with our most recent searches in January 2020. Articles published after 2013 on major elective surgery lists of adult patients were eligible, but cancer and cancer-related surgeries were excluded. Both randomised and non-randomised studies were eligible and the quality of studies was assessed with ROBINS-I and CASP tools. We registered the review in PROSPERO (CRD42019158455) and reported it in accordance with the PRISMA statement. RESULTS: The electronic search in five bibliographic databases yielded 7543 records (PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Cochrane) and 17 eligible articles were identified in the screening. There were four quasi-experimental studies, 11 observational studies and two systematic reviews. These demonstrated moderate to low risk of bias in their research methods. Three studies tested generic approaches using common prioritisation systems for all elective surgeries in common. The other studies assessed specific prioritisation approaches for re-ordering the waiting list for a particular surgical specialty. CONCLUSIONS: Explicit prioritisation tools with a standardised scoring system based on clear evidence-based criteria are likely to reduce waiting times and improve equitable access to health care. Multiple attributes need to be considered in defining a fair prioritisation system to overcome limitations with local variations and discriminations. Collating evidence from a diverse body of research provides a single framework to improve the quality and efficiency of elective surgical care provision in a variety of health settings. Universal prioritisation tools with vertical and horizontal equity would help with re-ordering patients on waiting lists for elective surgery and reduce waiting times.","Rathnayake, Dimuthu; Clarke, Mike; Jayasinghe, Viraj",PLoS One,305,5

Polysomnography (PSG) type I, the gold standard for the diagnosis of OSA, is expensive and difficult to access by low-income populations. In this study, we aimed to verify the accuracy of the oxyhemoglobin desaturation index (ODI) in comparison to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) using a portable monitor. METHODS: We evaluated 94 type III PSG home test results of 65 elderly patients (69.21±6.94 years old), along with information, such as the body mass index (BMI) and sex, using data obtained from a clinical trial database. RESULTS: A significant linear positive correlation (r=0.93, p<0.05) was observed between ODI and AHI, without any interference from sex, BMI, and positional component. The sensitivity of ODI compared to that of AHI increased with an increase in the severity of OSA, while the specificity of ODI in comparison to that of AHI was high for all degrees of severity. The accuracy of ODI was 80.7% for distinguishing between patients with mild and moderate apnea and 84.4% for distinguishing between patients with moderate and severe apnea. CONCLUSION: The ODI values obtained in uncontrolled conditions exhibited high sensitivity for identifying severe apnea compared to the AHI values, and correctly identified the severity of OSA in more than 80% of the cases. Thus, oximetry is promising strategy for diagnosing OSA.","da Rosa, João Carlos Fraga; Peres, Alessandra; Gasperin, Luciano; Martinez, Denis; Fontanella, Vania",Clinics (Sao Paulo),305,16

Recently, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the need for remote communication when patients and dentists cannot meet in person. Gingivitis is very common and characterized by red, swollen, bleeding gums. Gingivitis heals within 10 days of professional care and with daily, thorough oral hygiene practices. If left untreated, however, its progress may lead to teeth becoming mobile or lost. Of the many medical apps currently available, none monitor gingivitis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present a characterization and development model of a mobile health (mHealth) app called iGAM, which focuses on periodontal health and improves the information flow between dentists and patients. METHODS: A focus group discussed the potential of an app to monitor gingivitis, and 3 semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted on the use of apps for monitoring gum infections. We used a qualitative design process based on the Agile approach, which incorporated the following 5 steps: (1) user story, (2) use cases, (3) functional requirements, (4) nonfunctional requirements, and (5) Agile software development cycles. In a pilot study with 18 participants aged 18-45 years and with different levels of health literacy, participants were given a toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, toothpicks, and dental floss. After installing iGAM, they were asked to photograph their gums weekly for 4 weeks. RESULTS: All participants in the focus group believed in the potential of a mobile app to monitor gingivitis and reduce its severity. Concerns about security and privacy issues were discussed. From the interviews, 2 themes were derived: (1) “what's in it for me?” and (2) the need for a take-home message. The 5 cycles of development highlighted the importance of communication between dentists, app developers, and the pilot group. Qualitative analysis of the data from the pilot study showed difficulty with: (1) the camera, which was alleviated with the provision of mouth openers, and (2) the operation of the phone, which was alleviated by changing the app to be fully automated, with a weekly reminder and an instructions document. Final interviews showed satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: iGAM is the first mHealth app for monitoring gingivitis using self-photography. iGAM facilitates the information flow between dentists and patients between checkups and may be useful when face-to-face consultations are not possible (such as during the COVID-19 pandemic).","Tobias, Guy; Spanier, Assaf B",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,305,17

Pigs were monitored for clinical signs and PEDV RNA titers in feces and serum. For pathology and immunofluorescence staining for Ki67 (marker for crypt proliferation) and LGR5 (marker for crypt stem cell), 3–4 pigs were euthanized at postinoculation days (PIDs) 1, 3 and 5. Severe watery diarrhea and atrophic enteritis with moderate to high PEDV RNA titers in feces (7.5–12.2 log(10) GE/ml) and low viral RNA titers in serum (5.6–8.6 log(10) GE/ml) were observed in all inoculated nursing piglets at PIDs 1–5. In contrast, weaned pigs did not show evidence of PEDV infection at PID 1. Pigs exhibited high fecal shedding titers at PIDs 2–5 and mild to severe atrophic enteritis at PIDs 3–5, indicating a longer incubation for PEDV infection. While uninoculated or inoculated 27–31-day-old pigs showed large numbers of Ki67- or LGR5-positive cells in the intestinal crypts, there was a lack of LGR5-positive cells and low proliferation of crypts in jejunum of uninoculated 10–14-day-old piglets, possibly causing a slower turnover of enterocytes; however, the number of LGR5-positive cells and proliferation of intestinal crypts increased remarkably at 3–5 days after inoculation. Biologic mediators that promote crypt stem cell regeneration would be targets to improve the intestinal epithelium renewal during PEDV infection.","Jung, Kwonil; Annamalai, Thavamathi; Lu, Zhongyan; Saif, Linda J.",Vet Microbiol,305,24

METHODS: A cohort study using repeated measures of exposures and outcomes was conducted in healthy children (0 to 10 years) through The Applied Research Group for Kids (TARGet Kids!) COVID-19 Study of Children and Families in Toronto, Canada, between April 14 and July 15, 2020. Parents were asked to complete questionnaires about adherence to public health measures and children’s health behaviours. The primary exposure was the average number of days that children practiced public health preventive measures per week. The three outcomes were children’s outdoor time, total screen time, and sleep duration during COVID-19. Linear mixed-effects models were fitted using repeated measures of primary exposure and outcomes. RESULTS: This study included 554 observations from 265 children. The mean age of participants was 5.5 years, 47.5% were female and 71.6% had mothers of European ethnicity. Public health preventive measures were associated with shorter outdoor time (−17.2; 95% CI −22.07, −12.40; p < 0.001) and longer total screen time (11.3; 95% CI 3.88, 18.79; p = 0.003) during COVID-19.

However, the role of the lectin pathway (LP) of complement has not been explored. We examined mannose‐binding lectin associated serine protease (MASP2), the effector enzyme of the LP, in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and post‐allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) TMAs. Plasma MASP2 and terminal complement component sC5b‐9 levels were assessed by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Human MVEC were exposed to patient plasmas, and the effect of the anti‐MASP2 human monoclonal antibody narsoplimab on plasma‐induced MVEC activation was assessed by caspase 8 activity. MASP2 levels were highly elevated in all TMA patients versus controls. The relatively lower MASP2 levels in alloHSCT patients with TMAs compared to levels in alloHSCT patients who did not develop a TMA, and a significant decrease in variance of MASP2 levels in the former, may reflect MASP2 consumption at sites of disease activity. Plasmas from 14 of the 22 TMA patients tested (64%) induced significant MVEC caspase 8 activation. This was suppressed by clinically relevant levels of narsoplimab (1·2 μg/ml) for all 14 patients, with a mean 65·7% inhibition (36.8–99.4%; P < 0·0001). In conclusion, the LP of complement is activated in TMAs of diverse etiology. Inhibition of MASP2 reduces TMA plasma‐mediated MVEC injury in vitro. LP inhibition therefore may be of therapeutic benefit in these disorders.","Elhadad, S.; Chapin, J.; Copertino, D.; Van Besien, K.; Ahamed, J.; Laurence, J.",Clin Exp Immunol,305,29

For this reason, many medical diagnostic laboratories have made the switch to working in the field of molecular biology, and research undertaken to speed up the flow of samples through laboratory. The aim of this narrative review is to evaluate the current literature on laboratory techniques for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection available on pubmed.gov, Google Scholar, and according to the writers’ knowledge and experience of the laboratory medicine.

Targeting host cell pathways supporting viral replication is an attractive approach for development of antiviral compounds, especially with new, unexplored viruses where knowledge of virus biology is limited. Here, we present a strategy to identify host-targeted small molecule inhibitors using an image-based phenotypic antiviral screening assay followed by extensive target identification efforts revealing altered cellular pathways upon antiviral compound treatment. The newly discovered antiviral compounds showed broad-range antiviral activity against pathogenic RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, EBOV and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). Target identification of the antiviral compounds by thermal protein profiling revealed major effects on proteostasis pathways and disturbance in interactions between cellular HSP70 complex and viral proteins, illustrating the supportive role of HSP70 on many RNA viruses across virus families. Collectively, this strategy identifies new small molecule inhibitors with broad antiviral activity against pathogenic RNA viruses, but also uncovers novel virus biology urgently needed for design of new antiviral therapies.","Tampere, Marianna; Pettke, Aleksandra; Salata, Cristiano; Wallner, Olov; Koolmeister, Tobias; Cazares-Körner, Armando; Visnes, Torkild; Hesselman, Maria Carmen; Kunold, Elena; Wiita, Elisee; Kalderén, Christina; Lightowler, Molly; Jemth, Ann-Sofie; Lehtiö, Janne; Rosenquist, Åsa; Warpman-Berglund, Ulrika; Helleday, Thomas; Mirazimi, Ali; Jafari, Rozbeh; Puumalainen, Marjo-Riitta",Viruses,305,1

Because histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of paraffin‐embedded tissues play an important role in recognizing infectious agents in tissue samples, six in‐house polyclonal antibodies raised against three representative enteroviruses using an indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry were examined. This panel of polyclonal antibodies recognized three serotypes of enterovirus. Two of the polyclonal antibodies were raised against denatured virus particles from enterovirus A71, one was raised against the recombinant VP1 protein of coxsackievirus B3, and the other for poliovirus type 1 were raised against denatured virus particles, the recombinant VP1 protein and peptide 2C. Western blot analysis revealed that each of these antibodies recognized the corresponding viral antigen and none cross‐reacted with non‐enteroviruses within the family Picornaviridae. However, all cross‐reacted to some extent with the antigens derived from other serotypes of enterovirus. Indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry revealed that the virus capsid and non‐structural proteins were localized in the cytoplasm of affected culture cells, and skeletal muscles and neurons in neonatal mice experimentally‐infected with human enterovirus. The antibodies also recognized antigens derived from recent clinical isolates of enterovirus A71, coxsackievirus B3 and poliovirus. In addition, immunohistochemistry revealed that representative antibodies tested showed the same recognition pattern according to each serotype. Thus, the panel of in‐house anti‐enterovirus polyclonal antibodies described herein will be an important tool for the screening and pathological diagnosis for enterovirus infections, and may be useful for the classification of different enterovirus serotypes, including coxsackieviruses A and B, echoviruses, enterovirus A71 and poliovirus.","Kotani, Osamu; Iwata‐Yoshikawa, Naoko; Suzuki, Tadaki; Sato, Yuko; Nakajima, Noriko; Koike, Satoshi; Iwasaki, Takuya; Sata, Tetsutaro; Yamashita, Teruo; Minagawa, Hiroko; Taguchi, Fumihiro; Hasegawa, Hideki; Shimizu, Hiroyuki; Nagata, Noriyo",Neuropathology,305,1

The mechanism of nuclear translocation, and whether N protein associates with particular nucleolar components, is unknown. In this study, we confirm that a nucleolar phosphoprotein nucleophosmin (NPM1) interacts and co-localizes with the N protein in the nucleolus. In vitro binding studies indicated that aa 148–294 of N and aa 118–188 of NPM1 were required for binding. Interestingly, N protein importation into the nucleolus is independent of the ability of NPM1 to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Furthermore, overexpression of NPM1 promoted PEDV growth, while knockdown of NPM1 suppressed PEDV growth. In addition, binding of N protein to NPM1 protects it from proteolytic degradation by caspase-3, leading to increased cell survival. Taken together, our studies demonstrate a specific interaction of the N protein with the host cell protein NPM1 in the nucleolus. The results suggest potential linkages among viral strategies for the regulation of cell survival activities, possibly through an interaction of N protein with NPM1 which prevents its proteolytic cleavage and enhances cell survival, thus ultimately promoting the replication of PEDV.","Shi, Da; Shi, Hongyan; Sun, Dongbo; Chen, Jianfei; Zhang, Xin; Wang, Xiaobo; Zhang, Jialin; Ji, Zhaoyang; Liu, Jianbo; Cao, Liyan; Zhu, Xiangdong; Yuan, Jing; Dong, Hui; Wang, Xin; Chang, Tiecheng; Liu, Ye; Feng, Li",Sci Rep,305,1

Methods From September 2020- December 2020, trained study staff sent myLAB Box mail-based test kits and written instructions to gay, bisexual, and transgender study participants between the ages of 16-26 years. The test kits included a dried blood spot collection card for HIV (4th generation antigen/ antibody EIA) and syphilis (TP-EIA) testing, swabs and a urine collection kit for the detection of extragenital and genital Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, and a urine collection kit for the screening of six substances. Staff tracked shipment status, and when delivery was identified, contacted participants to assist them with selfcollection and test kit return. Results Of the 65 youth who participated to date, 49.2% (32/ 65) returned their kit and completed at least one test. Those 32 participants had a median age of 23.5 years (IQR 22-25). The median number of days from test kit ordered to results was 18.5 days (IQR 15-23.5);median number of days from collection to results was 10 days (IQR 8.5-12).

It is proposed that virus is normally latent in many elderly brains but reactivates periodically (as in the peripheral nervous system) under certain conditions, for example stress, immunosuppression, and peripheral infection, causing cumulative damage and eventually development of AD. Diverse approaches have provided data that explicitly support, directly or indirectly, these concepts. Several have confirmed HSV1 DNA presence in human brains, and the HSV1-APOE-ε4 association in AD. Further, studies on HSV1-infected APOE-transgenic mice have shown that APOE-e4 animals display a greater potential for viral damage. Reactivated HSV1 can cause direct and inflammatory damage, probably involving increased formation of beta amyloid (Aβ) and of AD-like tau (P-tau)—changes found to occur in HSV1-infected cell cultures. Implicating HSV1 further in AD is the discovery that HSV1 DNA is specifically localized in amyloid plaques in AD. Other relevant, harmful effects of infection include the following: dynamic interactions between HSV1 and amyloid precursor protein (APP), which would affect both viral and APP transport; induction of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in HSV1-infected astrocyte cultures, which has been linked to the likely effects of reactivation of the virus in brain. Several epidemiological studies have shown, using serological data, an association between systemic infections and cognitive decline, with HSV1 particularly implicated. Genetic studies too have linked various pathways in AD with those occurring on HSV1 infection. In relation to the potential usage of antivirals to treat AD patients, acyclovir (ACV) is effective in reducing HSV1-induced AD-like changes in cell cultures, and valacyclovir, the bioactive form of ACV, might be most effective if combined with an antiviral that acts by a different mechanism, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).","Itzhaki, Ruth F.",Front Aging Neurosci,305,1

In this study, we developed a duplex reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (duplex-rtRAA) assay containing an internal control in a single closed tube for the detection of human RSV. The internal control in the amplification effectively eliminated false-negative results and ensured the accuracy of the duplex-rtRAA system. We first developed and evaluated a universal singleplex-rtRAA assay for RSV. The sensitivity of this assay for RSV was determined as 4.4 copies per reaction, and the specificity was 100%. Next, a duplex-rtRAA assay with an internal control was established. The sensitivity of the duplex-rtRAA assay approached 5.0 copies per reaction, and no cross-reaction with other common respiratory viruses was observed. The two detection methods (singleplex-rtRAA and duplex-rtRAA) developed in this study were used to test 278 clinical specimens, and the results showed absolute consistency with RSV RT-qPCR analysis, demonstrating 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.

The Lancet Commission on pollution and health concludes that air pollution is the leading environmental cause of global disease and premature death. Indeed, there is a growing body of evidence that links air pollution not only to adverse cardiorespiratory effects but also to increased risk of cerebrovascular and neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite being a relatively new area of investigation, overall, there is mounting recent evidence showing that exposure to multiple air pollutants, in particular to fine particles, may affect the central nervous system (CNS) and brain health, thereby contributing to increased risk of stroke, dementia, Parkinson’s disease, cognitive dysfunction, neurodevelopmental disorders, depression and other related conditions. The underlying molecular mechanisms of susceptibility and disease remain largely elusive. However, emerging evidence suggests inflammation and oxidative stress to be crucial factors in the pathogenesis of air pollution-induced disorders, driven by the enhanced production of proinflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species in response to exposure to various air pollutants. From a public health perspective, mitigation measures are urgent to reduce the burden of disease and premature mortality from ambient air pollution.","Hahad, Omar; Lelieveld, Jos; Birklein, Frank; Lieb, Klaus; Daiber, Andreas; Münzel, Thomas",Int J Mol Sci,305,17

We here examine how the presence of direct purifying selection and background selection may bias demographic inference by evaluating two commonly-used methods (MSMC and fastsimcoal2), specifically studying how the underlying shape of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) and the fraction of directly selected sites interact with demographic parameter estimation. The results show that, even after masking functional genomic regions, background selection may cause the mis-inference of population growth under models of both constant population size and decline. This effect is amplified as the strength of purifying selection and the density of directly selected sites increases, as indicated by the distortion of the site frequency spectrum and levels of nucleotide diversity at linked neutral sites. We also show how simulated changes in background selection effects caused by population size changes can be predicted analytically. We propose a potential method for correcting for the mis-inference of population growth caused by selection. By treating the DFE as a nuisance parameter and averaging across all potential realizations, we demonstrate that even directly selected sites can be used to infer demographic histories with reasonable accuracy.","Johri, Parul; Riall, Kellen; Becher, Hannes; Excoffier, Laurent; Charlesworth, Brian; Jensen, Jeffrey D.",bioRxiv,305,29

The model was further examined against real data regarding the COVID-19 epidemic for seven European countries (with a total population of 290 million) during the periods in which social distancing measures were imposed, namely Italy and Spain, which had an enormous spread of the disease; the successful case of Greece; and four central European countries: France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. The value of the proposed model lies in its simplicity and in the fact that it is based on a universal natural mechanism, which through the presentation of an equivalent dynamical system apparently documents and provides a better understanding of the dynamical process behind viral epidemic spreads in general—even pandemics, such as in the case of COVID-19—further allowing us to come closer to controlling such situations.

Microinjection experiments showed that some ISVs might cross-infect between the two invasive whitefly cryptic species, Middle East Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1) and Mediterranean (MED), but others appeared to have a more restricted host range, reflecting the possibility of distinct long-term coevolution of these ISVs and whitefly hosts. Moreover, analysis of the profiles of virus-derived small-interfering RNAs indicated that some of the ISVs can successfully replicate in whitefly and the antiviral RNAi pathway of B. tabaci is actively involved in response to ISV infections. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the RNA virome, the distinct relationships and cross-cryptic species infectivity of ISVs in an agriculturally important insect vector.","Huang, Hai-Jian; Ye, Zhuang-Xin; Wang, Xin; Yan, Xiao-Tian; Zhang, Yan; He, Yu-Juan; Qi, Yu-Hua; Zhang, Xiao-Di; Zhuo, Ji-Chong; Lu, Gang; Lu, Jia-Bao; Mao, Qian-Zhuo; Sun, Zong-Tao; Yan, Fei; Chen, Jian-Ping; Zhang, Chuan-Xi; Li, Jun-Min",NPJ Biofilms Microbiomes,305,26

This case analysis describes the challenges faced by the ongoing Maracaibo Aging Study (MAS) during the deteriorating conditions in Venezuela. When the MAS began in 1997, it focused on memory-related disorders. Since then, strategic planning and proactive community participation allowed us to anticipate and address logistical, funding, and ethical challenges, and facilitated the enrollment and retention of more than 2500 subjects over 55 years of age. All participants, who are residents of the city of Maracaibo, Venezuela, underwent various assessments on several occasions. Here, we discuss how our approach to implementing a longitudinal, population-based study of age-related conditions has allowed our research program to continue throughout this period of political, economic, and social upheaval. DISCUSSION: As the social context in Venezuela became more complicated, new challenges emerged, and strategies to sustain the study and participation were refined. We identified five main mechanisms through which the evolving humanitarian crisis has affected implementation of the MAS: 1) community dynamics; 2) morale of researchers, staff, and participants; 3) financial feasibility; 4) components of the research process; and 5) impact on the health of staff, participants, and their families. Strategies to compensate for the impact on these components were implemented, based on inputs from community members and staff. Improved communication, greater involvement of stakeholders, broadening the scope of the project, and strengthening international collaboration have been the most useful strategies. Particular demands emerged, related to the increased mortality and comorbidities of participants and staff, and deterioration of basic services and safety. CONCLUSION: Although the MAS has faced numerous obstacles, it has been possible to continue a longitudinal research project throughout the humanitarian crisis, because our research team has engaged the community deeply and developed a sense of mutual commitment, and also because our project has provided funding to help keep researchers employed, somewhat attenuating the brain drain.","Maestre, Gladys E.; Pirela, Rosa V.; Paz, Carmen L.; Melgarejo, Jesus D.; Mena, Luis J.; Chavez, Carlos A.; Leendertz, Reinier; Petitto, Michele; Silva, Eglé; Calmón, Gustavo E.; Al-Aswad, Lama; Lee, Joseph H.; Terwilliger, Joseph D.",BMC Public Health,305,1

We exploit plausibly exogenous regional variation in the magnitude of the employment shock in Japan and adopt a difference-in-differences (DID) research design to identify the employment-shock impact. Our preferred point estimates suggest that a one-percentage-point decrease in the employment rate in the second quarter of 2020 resulted in an additional 0.14-0.44 male suicides per one hundred thousand male population in June 2020 and an additional 5.3-7.9 Public Assistance recipients per one hundred thousand population in August 2020. The impacts on female suicides and other poverty alleviation programs are not precisely estimated, but there is suggestive evidence that the same employment shock has also increased the caseloads of the other poverty alleviation programs. We also examine the impact of the increase in the unemployment rate and find a positive impact on the poverty alleviation programs but not on suicides.","Ando, M.; Furuichi, M.",,305,13

Previous work has focused primarily on hospitalized patients or on identifying risk factors for disease severity and mortality once the infection has taken place. We sought to leverage the ubiquity of smartphones and mobile applications to study risk factors for Covid-19 infection in a large, geographically heterogenous cohort. METHODS: We analyzed data obtained from the Covid-19 Citizen Science (CCS) Study, a worldwide, mobile application-based cohort. After employing forward selection to identify variables with p values < 0.1, multivariable logistic regression models were utilized to identify independent risk factors associated with prevalent SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Among 36,041 participants in 113 countries and all 50 states in the US, 484 participants had prevalent SARS-CoV-2 infection. After multivariable adjustment, being a healthcare worker, living with at least one school-aged child, having pets at home, and having immunodeficiency were each associated with an increased odds of SARS-CoV-2. The association between pets and prevalent SARS-CoV-2 was driven by dog ownership. After adjustment for the same covariates, Asian or Pacific Islander race, receiving a flu shot within the past year, increased level of education, and smoking or vaping marijuana within the last 30 days were each associated with a lower odds of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: We identified various characteristics and behaviors, many of which are potentially modifiable, associated with prevalent SARS-CoV-2 infection in a world-wide mobile application-based cohort.","Aung, Sidney; Vittinghoff, Eric; Nah, Gregory; Peyser, Noah D; Pletcher, Mark J; Olgin, Jeffrey E; Marcus, Gregory M",Int J Gen Med,305,1

For inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), gastrointestinal surgeries were postponed and changes in treatment and diagnostic procedures were made. As abrupt changes in treatment regimens may result in an increased morbidity and consequent well-being of patients with IBD, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with IBD. DESIGN: All patients with IBD who completed both Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire between 31 August and 13 September 2020 were included in our cohort study. The primary end point was to determine the HRQoL in patients with IBD, measured by the IBDQ and SF-36 questionnaire. The secondary end point was determining which factors influence the HRQoL in patients with IBD. RESULTS: 582 patients with IBD filled in the IBDQ and SF-36 questionnaire. The HRQoL in our study population was low according to the questionnaires on both physical and mental subscales. In addition, multivariate analysis showed that increased age, female sex and patients who underwent surgery had a significantly lower HRQoL, most frequently on the physical domains in both questionnaires. CONCLUSION: Patients with IBD had an overall low HRQoL during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, older patients, women and patients who underwent surgical procedures had the lowest physical HRQoL.","de Bock, Ellen; Filipe, Mando D; Meij, Vincent; Oldenburg, Bas; van Schaik, Fiona D M; Bastian, Okan W; Fidder, Herma F; Vriens, Menno R; Richir, Milan C",BMJ Open Gastroenterol,305,1

Paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS) with thymoma presents a challenge to clinicians because of the need to decipher the association between the presenting symptoms and the underlying tumor. The condition most commonly noted in patients with PNS with thymoma is myasthenia gravis. Other common autoimmune diseases that may present as PNS include systemic lupus erythematosus, pure red cell aplasia, and Good syndrome. Seventy-six percent of patients with PNS-associated thymoma experience resolution of PNS after curing thymoma. Materials and Methods: A 37-year-old man with a two-month fever accompanied by polyarthritis accidently found thymoma after contrast computed tomography scans of his chest. He accepted Video assisted thoracoscopic surgery with resection of thymoma. Results: Fever and polyarthritis resolved after operation but recurred in five days due to cytomegalovirus viremia, which might be predisposed by previous antibiotics treatment before the diagnosis of thymoma. Conclusion: Patients with a thymoma also have a high frequency of PNS, and the most frequent condition found in patients with PNS-associated thymoma is myasthenia gravis. Fever with polyarthritis has been rarely reported as a symptom of PNS-associated thymoma. Here we reported an unusual case of PNS mimicking reactive arthritis with thymoma, as diagnosed based on the patient’s clinical progression, imaging examination, and laboratory tests. The patient died of his comorbidities, and his death may have been related to long-term antibiotic use and consequent intestinal dysbiosis. This challenging case may help to inform clinicians of the need for detailed work-up of fever with unknown origin in the presence of chronic polyarthritis to prevent the overdiagnosis of inflammatory arthritis or rheumatic disease and avoid further comorbidities. Detailed work-up should include the patient’s history of infections, inflammation, and malignant or nonmalignant tumors.","Liao, Chang-Hung; Lyu, Sin-Yi; Chen, Hsiang-Cheng; Chang, Deh-Ming; Lu, Chun-Chi",Medicina (Kaunas),305,1

Although various molecular diagnostic methods based on nucleic acid amplification have been suggested as gold standards for identifying different species, these methods are not suitable for the rapid diagnosis of pathogens owing to their long result acquisition times and complexity. In this study, we developed a rapid bio-optical sensor that uses a ball-lensed optical fiber (BLOF) probe and an automatic analysis platform to precisely diagnose infectious pathogens. The BLOF probe is easy to align and has a high optical sensing sensitivity (1.5-fold) and a large detection range (1.2-fold) for an automatic optical sensing system. Automatic signal processing of up to 250 copies/reaction of DNA of Q-fever-causing Coxiella burnetii was achieved within 8 min. The clinical utility of this system was demonstrated with 18 clinical specimens (9 Q-fever and 9 other febrile disease samples) by measuring the resonant wavelength shift of positive or negative samples for Coxiella burnetii DNA. The results from the system revealed the stable and automatic optical signal measurement of DNA with 100% accuracy. We envision that this BLOF probe-based sensor would be a practical tool for the rapid, simple, and sensitive diagnosis of emerging infectious pathogens.","Park, Byungjun; Koo, Bonhan; Kim, Jisub; Lee, Kiri; Bang, Hyeonjin; Kim, Sung-Han; Jhang, Kyung Young; Shin, Yong; Lee, Seungrag",Biosensors (Basel),305,20

The present review assesses requirements for implementation of COVID-19 RDTs in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Review of PubMed-published articles assessing COVID-19 RDTs complemented with Instructions for Use (IFU) of products. Results: In total 47 articles on two COVID-19 Ag RDTs and 54 COVID-19 Ab RDTs and IFUs of 20 COVID-19 Ab RDTs were retrieved. Only five COVID-19 Ab RDTs (9.3%) were assessed with capillary blood sampling at the point-of-care; none of the studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Sampling: Challenges for COVID-19 Ag RDTs include nasopharyngeal sampling (technique, biosafety) and sample stability; for COVID-19 Ab RDTs equivalence of whole blood vs. plasma/serum needs further validation (assessed for only eight (14.8%) products). Sensitivity—Specificity: sensitivity of COVID-19 Ag and Ab RDTs depend on viral load (antigen) and timeframe (antibody), respectively; COVID-19 Ab tests have lower sensitivity compared to laboratory test platforms and the kinetics of IgM and IgG are very similar. Reported specificity was high but has not yet been assessed against tropical pathogens. Kit configuration: For COVID-19 Ag RDTs, flocked swabs should be added to the kit; for COVID-19 Ab RDTs, finger prick sampling materials, transfer devices, and controls should be added (currently only supplied in 15, 5, and 1/20 products). Usability and Robustness: some COVID-19 Ab RDTs showed high proportions of faint lines (>40%) or invalid results (>20%). Shortcomings were reported for buffer vials (spills, air bubbles) and their instructions for use. Stability: storage temperature was ≤ 30°C for all but one RDT, in-use and result stability were maximal at 1 h and 30 min, respectively. Integration in the healthcare setting requires a target product profile, landscape overview of technologies, certified manufacturing capacity, a sustainable market, and a stringent but timely regulation. In-country deployment depends on integration in the national laboratory network. Discussion/Conclusion: Despite these limitations, successful implementation models in triage, contact tracing, and surveillance have been proposed, in particular for COVID-19 Ab RDTs. Valuable experience is available from implementation of other disease-specific RDTs in sub-Saharan Africa.","Jacobs, Jan; Kühne, Vera; Lunguya, Octavie; Affolabi, Dissou; Hardy, Liselotte; Vandenberg, Olivier",Front Med (Lausanne),305,16

Evidence is taken from the COVID-19 Health System Response Monitor, a joint initiative of the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, the WHO Regional Office for Europe, and the European Commission, which has documented country responses to COVID-19 using a structured template completed by country experts. We show all countries faced common challenges during the pandemic, including difficulties in scaling-up testing capacity, implementing timely and appropriate containment measures amid much uncertainty and overcoming shortages of health and social care workers, personal protective equipment and other medical technologies. Country responses to address these issues were similar in many ways, but dissimilar in others, reflecting differences in health system organization and financing, political leadership and governance structures. In the US, lack of universal health coverage have created barriers to accessing care, while political pushback against scientific leadership has likely undermined the crisis response. Our findings highlight the importance of consistent messaging and alignment between health experts and political leadership to increase the level of compliance with public health measures, alongside the need to invest in health infrastructure and training and retaining an adequate domestic health workforce. Building on innovations in care delivery seen during the pandemic, including increased use of digital technology, can also help inform development of more resilient health systems longer-term.","Unruh, Lynn; Allin, Sara; Marchildon, Greg; Burke, Sara; Barry, Sarah; Siersbaek, Rikke; Thomas, Steve; Rajan, Selina; Koval, Andriy; Alexander, Mathew; Merkur, Sherry; Webb, Erin; Williams, Gemma A",Health policy,305,1

Data on immunogenicity and safety of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) are limited. METHODS: A multicentre observational study evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of the two-dose regimen BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in adult patients with AIIRD (n=686) compared with the general population (n=121). Serum IgG antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike S1/S2 proteins were measured 2–6 weeks after the second vaccine dose. Seropositivity was defined as IgG ≥15 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL. Vaccination efficacy, safety, and disease activity were assessed within 6 weeks after the second vaccine dose. RESULTS: Following vaccination, the seropositivity rate and S1/S2 IgG levels were significantly lower among patients with AIIRD versus controls (86% (n=590) vs 100%, p<0.0001 and 132.9±91.7 vs 218.6±82.06 BAU/mL, p<0.0001, respectively). Risk factors for reduced immunogenicity included older age and treatment with glucocorticoids, rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and abatacept. Rituximab was the main cause of a seronegative response (39% seropositivity). There were no postvaccination symptomatic cases of COVID-19 among patients with AIIRD and one mild case in the control group. Major adverse events in patients with AIIRD included death (n=2) several weeks after the second vaccine dose, non-disseminated herpes zoster (n=6), uveitis (n=2), and pericarditis (n=1). Postvaccination disease activity remained stable in the majority of patients. CONCLUSION: mRNA BNTb262 vaccine was immunogenic in the majority of patients with AIIRD, with an acceptable safety profile.

We sought to estimate case detection percentages with various routine NP and saliva testing frequencies. DESIGN: Simulation modelling study. METHODS: We constructed a sensitivity function based on the average infectiousness profile of symptomatic COVID-19 cases to determine the probability of being identified at the time of testing. This function was fitted to reported data on the percent positivity of symptomatic COVID-19 patients using NP testing. We then simulated a routine testing program with different NP and saliva testing frequencies to determine case detection percentages during the infectious period, as well as the pre-symptomatic stage. RESULTS: Routine bi-weekly NP testing, once every two weeks, identified an average of 90.7% (SD: 0.18) of cases during the infectious period and 19.7% (SD: 0.98) during the pre-symptomatic stage. With a weekly NP testing frequency, the corresponding case detection percentages were 95.9% (SD: 0.18) and 32.9% (SD: 1.23), respectively. A 5-day saliva testing schedule had a similar case detection percentage as weekly NP testing during the infectious period, but identified about 10% more cases (mean: 42.5%; SD: 1.10) during the pre-symptomatic stage.

This article examines the development, implementation, and processes of a restrictive housing reentry program in the Oregon Department of Corrections. It draws on data from official documents, site observations, and interviews with 12 prison officials and 38 prisoners. The Step Up Program (SUP) seeks to improve the living conditions in restrictive housing over business-as-usual, alleviate physiological and psychological harms of solitary confinement, and use rehabilitative programming to increase success upon returning to the general prison population or community. RESULTS: The impetus to change the culture and structure of restrictive housing was primarily the result of internal administrative reform. Prisoners assigned at random to housing assignments offered accounts of their daily activities suggesting that the SUP provides more time out-of-cell and greater access to other services and activities. Program participants preferred the living conditions in the SUP because they had more opportunities for social interaction and incentives for compliant behavior. However, views on the value of programming among respondents were mixed. CONCLUSIONS: The launch of the SUP occurred in early 2020, which was soon followed by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the program was never fully implemented as intended. As Oregon returns to more normal operations, it is possible that the SUP will be able to include even more out-of-cell time, greater socialization opportunities, and increased access to programming and other beneficial activities. As we await the opportunity to conduct prospective psychological and behavioral analyses, this study provides tentative support for the use of step down reentry programs in restrictive housing units.

So far, no approved vaccines and specific treatment options against LASV exist. To develop specific fusion inhibitors against LASV, we solved the crystal structure of the post-fusion 6 helix bundle (6-HB) formed by two heptad repeat domains (HR1 and HR2) of GP2. This fusion core contains a parallel trimeric coiled-coil of three HR1 helices, around which three HR2 helices are entwined in an antiparallel manner. Various hydrophobic and charged interactions form between HR1 and HR2 domains to stabilize the overall conformation of GP2 fusion core. Based on the structure, we designed several peptides spanning the HR2 domain and tested their antiviral activities. We found that the longer HR2 peptides were effective in inhibiting LASV GPC protein-mediated cell–cell fusion under low pH condition. These results not only suggest that LASV infects the target cell mainly through endocytosis, including micropinocytosis, and membrane fusion at low pH, but also provide an important basis for rational design of LASV fusion inhibitors.","Zhang, Xuejiao; Wang, Cong; Chen, Baohua; Wang, Qian; Xu, Wei; Ye, Sheng; Jiang, Shibo; Zhu, Yun; Zhang, Rongguang",Front Microbiol,305,26

Thymoquinone (TQ) is one of the most active ingredients in Nigella sativa seeds. It has a variety of beneficial properties including anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities. Here, we investigated the possible protective effects of TQ against kidney damage in septic BALB/c mice. Eight-week-old male BALB/c mice were divided into four groups: control, TQ, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and TQ+CLP. CLP was performed after 2 weeks of TQ gavage. After 48 h, we measured the histopathological alterations in the kidney tissue and the serum levels of creatinine (CRE) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). We also evaluated pyroptosis (NLRP3, caspase-1), apoptosis (caspase-3, caspase-8), proinflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6)-related protein and gene expression levels. Our results demonstrated that TQ inhibited CLP-induced increased serum CRE and BUN levels. It also significantly inhibited the high levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, caspase-3, caspase-8, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 induced by CLP. Furthermore, NF-κB protein level was significantly decreased in the TQ+CLP group than in the CLP group. Together, our results indicate that TQ may be a potential therapeutic agent for sepsis-induced AKI.","Guo, Li-Peng; Liu, Si-Xu; Yang, Qin; Liu, Hong-Yang; Xu, Lu-Lu; Hao, Yu-Hua; Zhang, Xiao-Qing",Biomed Res Int,305,2

In addition to immune suppression cessation, multiple therapies have been tried with no supportive evidence. Favipiravir and colchicine showed benefit in some reports. Here we describe 19 adult renal transplant recipients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who were treated with the cessation of immunosuppression, favipiravir, and colchicine on an outpatient basis. RESULTS: This case series includes 19 renal transplant recipients with a mean age of 38.4 + 11.6 years and a mean duration of 55.9 + 36.1 months post-transplant. They were maintained on triple therapy with a calcineurine inhibitor, antiproliferative therapy and steroids. The laboratory data at weeks 1,2, and 3 showed that at weeks 2 all markers of inflammation increased especially serum ferritin (1718 + 315 ng/ml). Serum creatinine increased by < 30% with urine protein creatinine of < 500 mg/g. The mean time to recovery was 13 + 3.1 days. The patient who was on mTOR inhibitor showed the highest inflammatory response and the longest time to recovery, 18 days. All patients showed complete recovery with stable graft function and no patient warranted dialysis, nor ICU care. CONCLUSION: In the settings of limited resources, unavailability of costly immunomodulatory therapies and limited hospital capacity, early case definition, judicious management of immune suppression, and affordable antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs will improve outcome in early cases of COVID-19 in renal transplant recipients.","Ali, Ala; S.

The effect of these lockdown measures on road safety remain to be fully understood, however preliminary data shows reductions in traffic volume and increases in risky driving behaviors. The objective of the present study is to compare self-reported risky driving behaviors (speeding, distracted driving, drinking and driving, and drugged driving) during the pandemic in Canada and the U.S. to determine what differences exist between these two countries. Data was collected using the Road Safety Monitor (RSM), an annual online public opinion survey that investigates key road safety issues, administered to a representative sample of N = 1,500 Canadian drivers and N = 1,501 U.S. drivers. Respondents were asked about the likelihood of engaging in risky driving during the pandemic as compared to before COVID-19. Results show the majority of respondents indicated their behavior did not change, and most positively, a small proportion reported they were less likely to engage in these risky driving behaviors. However, notable proportions indicated they were more likely to engage in risky driving behaviors during the pandemic, as compared to before COVID-19. Of those who indicated this, U.S. drivers had significantly higher percentages compared to their Canadian counterparts. Behaviors most often reported by this sub-section of drivers who admit to being more likely to engage in risky driving during the pandemic were speeding (7.6%) and drinking and driving (7.6%) in the U.S., and speeding (5.5%) and distracted driving (4.2%) in Canada. Logistic regression results confirm that country was a significant factor, as U.S. drivers had greater odds of reporting they were more likely to engage in these risky driving behaviors, with the exception of speeding. Age also had a significant effect, as increasing age was associated with lower odds of reporting that these risky driving behaviors were more likely during the pandemic. Conversely, sex did not have a significant effect. Overall, the current findings suggest that a small proportion of drivers reported being more likely to engage in risky driving behaviors and the pandemic may have led to changes in the profiles of those drivers engaging in risky driving behaviors during lockdown measures. These results have important implications for policies and can inform how to manage road safety during future lockdowns.","Vanlaar, W G M; Woods-Fry, H; Barrett, H; Lyon, C; Brown, S; Wicklund, C; Robertson, R D",Accid Anal Prev,305,1

Here, we explore the early perceived effects of COVID-19 on dermatology residents through an electronic sample survey and identify possible areas for targeted improvement in lieu of a possible second wave of COVID-19 cases. METHODS: On April 3, 2020, a survey of link with 25 questions was sent to dermatology program coordinators to be disseminated among dermatology residents in the United States. The survey was closed on April 13, 2020. All of the questions were optional and no personal identifiers were collected. RESULTS: A total of 140 dermatology residents from 50 different residency programs across 26 states responded to the survey. The majority of respondents (85%) reported negative effects of COVID-19 on their overall wellness. Despite the majority of residents (92%) speculating that COVID-19 will have negative long-term effects on the US economy, only 33% agreed or strongly agreed that it will affect their job prospects. Teledermatology was widely implemented following the declaration of a national emergency (96% of represented residencies compared with only 30% before the pandemic), with heavy resident involvement. The majority of residents (99%) reported having virtual didactics and that they found them to be beneficial. Most residents were uncomfortable with the prospect of being reassigned to a nondermatology specialty during the pandemic. In addition, 22% of residents believed that their leadership were not transparent and prompt in addressing changes relating to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Dermatology residents were affected negatively by COVID-19 in regard to their well-being, clinical training, and education. Several areas of improvement were identified that could improve our preparedness for a second wave of the virus.","Li, Yumeng M.; Galimberti, Fabrizio; Abrouk, Michael; Kirsner, Robert S.",South Med J,305,16

Here we have utilised RNA-seq to define cellular pathways regulated by ILRUN in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We find that inhibition of ILRUN expression increases cellular expression of several members of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), including the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Furthermore, inhibition of ILRUN results in increased SARS-CoV-2 replication. These data identify ILRUN as a novel inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication and represents, to our knowledge, the first report of ILRUN as a regulator of the RAAS. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT There is no doubt that the current rapid global spread of COVID-19 has had significant and far-reaching impacts on our health and economy and will continue to do so. Research in emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is growing rapidly, with new breakthroughs in the understanding of host-virus interactions and the development of innovative and exciting therapeutic strategies and new knowledge and tools to better protect against the impacts of disease. The human protein-coding gene ILRUN is a recently-characterised inhibitor of the transcription regulators p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP). Here we present the first evidence that ILRUN modulation has implications for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Virus infectivity assays confirmed that gene silencing of ILRUN had a proviral effect and increased SARS-CoV-2 replication, whilst over-expression of ILRUN inhibited SARS-CoV-2 production. Additionally, we observed that ILRUN also regulates the expression of key elements of the RAAS. These data have important implications for the development of antiviral strategies to deal with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Tribolet, Leon; Alexander, Marina R.; Brice, Aaron M.; van Vuren, Petrus Jansen; Rootes, Christina L.; Mara, Kostlend; McDonald, Meg; Bruce, Kerri L.; Gough, Tamara J.; Shi, Shuning; Cowled, Christopher; Bean, Andrew G.

Therefore, we established a surveillance system in the emergency room and established principles for managing patients suspected of COVID-19 who require emergency surgery. CASE SUMMARY: A 67-year-old man was diagnosed with appendicitis in March 2020. His wife was diagnosed with COVID-19 10 d earlier, and the patient was in close contact with her. The patient tested negative twice on an upper respiratory COVID-19 reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction screening test, but chest X-ray and chest computed tomography revealed patchy ground-glass opacity in both upper lobes of the patient’s lungs. The same emergency surgery procedure for patients with confirmed COVID-19 was applied to this patient suspected of having the disease to ensure that surgery was not delayed while waiting for the reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction results. A few hours after surgery, the upper respiratory tract specimen taken in the emergency room was negative for COVID-19 but the lower respiratory tract specimen was found to be positive for the disease. CONCLUSION: When COVID-19 is suspected, emergency surgery should be performed as for confirmed COVID-19 without delay.","Kim, Changho; Kim, Jong Kun; Yeo, In Hwan; Choe, Jae Young; Lee, Jeong Eun; Kang, So Jeong; Park, Chan Sub; Kwon, Ki Tae; Hwang, Soyoon",World J Clin Cases,305,20

Though evidence-based cost-effective interventions that are predicted to prevent up to one-third of maternal, newborn, and child health complications and deaths with universal coverage have been identified, more than 50% of people living in rural areas or from poor families still do not have access to these interventions in resource-constrained settings. METHODS: We conducted a multicountry systematic analysis of bottlenecks and proposed solutions to strengthen community health systems through a series of collaborative workshops in 22 countries in WCA. Countries were categorized by their under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) to assess specificities related to reported challenges. We also reviewed existing data on selected health system tracer interventions to analyze country profiles. RESULTS: The bottlenecks identified as severe or very severe were related to health financing (19 countries, 86%), essential medical technology and products (16 countries, 73%), integrated health service delivery (14 countries, 64%), and community ownership and partnerships (self-reported by 14 countries, 64%). Only the integrated service delivery was self-reported as a severe challenge by countries with high U5MR. The issue of human resources for community health was one of the least reported challenges. CONCLUSION: In WCA, strengthening community health systems as part of PHC revitalization efforts should focus on increasing health financing and innovative investments, strengthening the logistics management system, and fostering community ownership and partnerships. Countries with high U5MR should also reinforce integrated service delivery approaches through innovation.

By using an all-optical approach, we achieve ultra-fast temperature response with real-time temperature feedback using nanoliter scale reaction volumes. The system uses a microcavity to act as a nanoliter scale reaction vessel with a laser-driven and optically monitored temperature cycling system for ultrafast thermal cycling and incorporates an all-fiber fluorescence excitation/detection system to achieve real-time, high sensitivity fluorescence monitoring of the qPCR process. Further, we demonstrate the potential of the system to operate as a label-free qPCR system through direct optical measurement of the sample refractive index.

Marshallese are disproportionately burdened by poorer maternal and infant health outcomes. Exclusive breastfeeding can prevent or help mitigate maternal and infant health disparities. However, exclusive breastfeeding among United States Marshallese communities remains disproportionately low, and the reasons are not well documented. This paper describes the protocol of a mixed-methods concurrent triangulation longitudinal study designed to explore the beliefs and experiences that serve as barriers and/or facilitators to exclusive breastfeeding intention, initiation, and duration among Marshallese mothers in northwest Arkansas. METHODS: The mixed-methods design collects qualitative and quantitative data during simultaneous data collection events, at third trimester, six weeks postpartum, and six months postpartum. Quantitative and qualitative data will be analyzed separately and then synthesized during the interpretation phase. The research team will disseminate results to study participants, research stakeholders, the broader Marshallese community, and fellow researchers. DISCUSSION: Findings and results will be presented in subsequent manuscripts upon completion of the study. This study will be an important first step to better understand beliefs and experiences to exclusive breastfeeding intention, initiation, and duration in this community and will inform tools and interventions to help improve health outcomes. The study will also aid in filling the gap in research and providing essential information on the infant feeding beliefs and barriers among a Marshallese community in Arkansas.

The results revealed that 25 (9.0%) of them were PCR-positive. The sensitivity and specificity of the MHLW criteria were 100% and 10.7%, respectively. When the criteria excluded nonspecific symptoms, fatigue, and dyspnea, the sensitivity slightly decreased to 92%, and the specificity increased to 22.2%. The specificity was highest when the fever criterion was ≥37.5°C for ≥4 days, and exposure/travel history, including age and underlying comorbidities, was considered.

As of April 24th, mortality from COVID-19 has reached almost 200,000 people, with the United States (US) leading the globe in levels of morbidity and mortality. Large volumes of high acuity patients, particularly those of advanced age and with chronic co-morbidities, have significantly increased the need for palliative care resources beyond usual capacity. More specifically, COVID-19 has changed the way we approach patient and family member interactions. Concern for nosocomial spread of this infection has resulted in strict visitation restrictions that have left many patients to face this illness, make difficult decisions, and even die, alone in the hospital. In order to meet the needs of COVID patients, services such as Emergency Medicine and Palliative Care have responded rapidly by adopting novel ways of practicing medicine. We describe the use of telepalliative medicine (TM) implemented in an Emergency Department (ED) setting to allow family members the ability to interact with their loved ones during critical illness, and even during end of life. Use of this technology has helped facilitate goals of care discussions, in addition to providing contact and closure for both patients and their loved ones. We describe our rapid and ongoing implementation of TM consultation for our ED patients and discuss lessons learned and recommendations for others considering similar care models.","Flores, Stefan; Abrukin, Liliya; Jiang, Lynn; Titone, Lauren; Firew, Tsion; Lee, Jihae; Gavin, Nicholas; Romney, Marie-Laure; Nakagawa, Shunichi; Chang, Bernard P.",J Emerg Med,305,23

We conducted a case-control study in central Vietnam in 2016. A total of 378 febrile adult patients (AUFs) with a fever for ≤21 days, no evidence of localized infection and negative screening tests for dengue and malaria, and 384 afebrile adult patients (Controls) were prospectively enrolled. Whole blood, plasma, eschar swab, throat swab and urine specimens were collected and analysed. Quantitative PCR and RT-PCR were used to test for 55 bacteria, viruses and their subtypes. Serological tests were also used to test for rickettsial agents. The most common aetiology was influenza virus (20.9% in AUFs vs. 0% in Controls), followed by rickettsial agents (mainly Orientia tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia typhi) (10.8% vs. 0.3%), dengue virus (7.7% vs. 0.5%), Leptospira (4.8% vs. 0.8%), adenovirus (4.8% vs. 1.0%), and enterovirus (2.1% vs. 0%) (p < .05). The real proportion of dengue in AUF cases was underestimated because patients with dengue-positive rapid diagnosis tests were excluded from the study. The emerging agent Rickettsia felis, which had not been previously observed in Vietnam, was detected in this study. In total, 216 patients (57.1%) were given causative diagnoses, comprising 143 (66.2%) monoinfections and 73 (33.8%) coinfections. The infections caused by these agents should be considered in clinical practice and further studies. Additionally, agents susceptible to doxycycline were detected in 15.6% of AUFs; thus, this drug should be included in the panel used to treat AUF patients.","Le-Viet, Nhiem; Le, Viet-Nho; Chung, Hai; Phan, Duc-Tuan; Phan, Quang-Duong; Cao, Thanh-Van; Abat, Cédric; Raoult, Didier; Parola, Philippe",Emerg Microbes Infect,305,21

There are several potential overlapping mechanisms by which metformin may reduce mortality from Covid-19. Metformin’s past anti-infectious benefits have been both against the infectious agent directly, as well as by improving the underlying health of the human host.

Patients affected by hematological neoplasms appear to be particularly at risk of developing COVID-19 complications, with unfavorable outcomes. Here, we present the case of a 57-years-old woman diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and concurrent acute myeloid leukemia (AML). At the time of diagnosis, it was decided to postpone leukemia therapy to enable adequate COVID-19 pneumonia treatment. When her conditions related to pneumonia improved, the combination of Azacitidine-Venetoclax was used as first-line treatment instead of conventional intensive chemotherapy. At the end of the first two cycles, the patient showed complete remission, and a post-remission consolidation with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been planned. This case suggests that Azacytidine-Venetoclax induction may represent a valid and safe alternative to intensive chemotherapy in the challenging setting of patients with a concomitant diagnosis of AML and severe COVID-19 infection.","Taurino, Daniela; Frigeni, Marco; Grassi, Anna; Cavallaro, Gianluca; Salmoiraghi, Silvia; Spinelli, Orietta; Rambaldi, Alessandro; Lussana, Federico",Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,305,26

However, the pathogenesis of angiostrongylosis remains elusive. Natural killer cells (NK cells) are unique innate lymphocytes important in early defense against pathogens. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of NK cells in A. cantonensis infection and to elucidate the key factors that recruit NK cells into the CNS. METHODS: Mouse model of A. cantonensis infection was established by intragastric administration of third-stage larvae. The expression of cytokines and chemokines at gene and protein levels was analyzed by qRT-PCR and ELISA. Distribution of NK cells was observed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against YAC-1 cells was detected by LDH release assay. The ability of NK cells to secrete cytokines was determined by intracellular flow cytometry and ELISA. Depletion and adoptive transfer of NK cells in vivo was induced by tail vein injection of anti-asialo GM1 rabbit serum and purified splenic NK cells, respectively. CX(3)CL1 neutralization experiment was performed by intraperitoneal injection of anti-CX(3)CL1 rat IgG. RESULTS: The infiltration of NK cells in the CNS of A. cantonensis-infected mice was observed from 14 dpi and reached the peak on 18 and 22 dpi. Compared with uninfected splenic NK cells, the CNS-infiltrated NK cells of infected mice showed enhanced cytotoxicity and increased IFN-γ and TNF-α production ability. Depletion of NK cells alleviated brain injury, whereas adoptive transfer of NK cells exacerbated brain damage in A. cantonensis-infected mice. The expression of CX(3)CL1 in the brain tissue and its receptor CX(3)CR1 on the CNS-infiltrated NK cells were both elevated after A. cantonensis infection. CX(3)CL1 neutralization reduced the percentage and absolute number of the CNS-infiltrated NK cells and relieved brain damage caused by A. cantonensis infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the up-regulated CX(3)CL1 in the brain tissue recruits NK cells into the CNS and aggravates brain damage caused by A. cantonensis infection. The findings improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of angiostrongyliasis and expand the therapeutic intervention in CNS disease.","Zhang, Rong; Miao, Tingting; Qin, Min; Zhao, Chengsi; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Chengcheng; Liu, Xinjian; Chen, Ying; Chen, Ailing; Wang, Yong",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,305,7

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID‐19 patients in Thailand and review important aspects of this disease in ASEAN. METHODS: Thai patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand, were evaluated between 1 January 2020 and 30 April 2020. Patients' data, clinical presentation, exposure risk, past medical history, laboratory results, and treatment outcomes were extensively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 352 COVID‐19 tests were performed, and 40 patients with positive tests were studied. The mean age was 30.5 years, and 55% were female. Most (82.5%) had no underlying diseases. Comorbidities were associated with severe COVID‐19 (odds ratio [OR] 29.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.31–388.40, P = 0.009). Gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 12 patients (30%). The most common presenting symptoms were anorexia (17.5%) and diarrhea (15%). Gastrointestinal symptoms developed before (9.1%), concurrent with (63.6%), and after (27.3%) respiratory symptoms. Diarrhea was significantly associated with severe COVID‐19 (OR 38.52; 95% CI 3.11–476.70, P = 0.004). Twenty‐four patients (60%) received antiviral drugs; 40% had only supportive care. Only one patient required intensive care. No patient died. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal manifestations in COVID‐19 patients are common symptoms and can occur anytime during the disease course. Patients presenting with only gastrointestinal symptoms should raise clinical suspicion for COVID‐19 in areas with high disease incidence.

Infecting C57BL/6 mice with Plasmodium berghei K173 strain (PbK) resulted in pulmonary oedema, capillaries congested with leukocytes and infected red blood cells (iRBCs), and leukocyte infiltration into the lungs. This new model of malaria-associated lung pathology, without any accompanying cerebral complications, allows the investigation of mechanisms leading to the lung disease. The activity of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in alveolar epithelial cells is decreased by several respiratory tract pathogens and this is suggested to contribute to pulmonary oedema. We show that PbK, a pathogen that remains in the circulation, also decreased the activity and expression of ENaC, suggesting that infectious agents can have indirect effects on ENaC activity in lung epithelial cells. The reduced ENaC activity may contribute to the pulmonary oedema induced by PbK malaria.","Hee, Leia; Dinudom, Anuwat; Mitchell, Andrew J.; Grau, Georges E.; Cook, David I.; Hunt, Nicholas H.; Ball, Helen J.",Int J Parasitol,305,20

However, because of a number of factors, including changing trends in the use of technology over time, results on the efficacy of these interventions have been mixed. An updated framework is needed to help researchers better plan behavioral technology interventions by anticipating the needed resources and potential changes in trends that may affect interventions over time. Focusing on the domain of health interventions as a use case, we present the Adaptive Behavioral Components (ABC) model for technology-based behavioral interventions. ABC is composed of five components: basic behavior change; intervention, or problem-focused characteristics; population, social, and behavioral characteristics; individual-level and personality characteristics; and technology characteristics. ABC was designed with the goals of (1) guiding high-level development for digital technology–based interventions; (2) helping interventionists consider, plan for, and adapt to potential barriers that may arise during longitudinal interventions; and (3) providing a framework to potentially help increase the consistency of findings among digital technology intervention studies. We describe the planning of an HIV prevention intervention as a case study for how to implement ABC into intervention design. Using the ABC model to plan future interventions might help to improve the design of and adherence to longitudinal behavior change intervention protocols; allow these interventions to adapt, anticipate, and prepare for changes that may arise over time; and help to potentially improve intervention behavior change outcomes. Additional research is needed on the influence of each of ABC’s components to help improve intervention design and implementation.","Young, Sean D",J Med Internet Res,305,5

At the time of its arrival in Italy, available literary data were meager, and most of them concerned its epidemiology. World Health Organization proposed guidelines in march 2020, a strategy of treatment has been developed, and a significant number of subsequent articles have been published to understand, prevent, and cure COVID patients. METHODS: From the observation of two patients, we performed a careful analysis of scientific literature to unearth the relation between COVID infection, clinical manifestations as pneumonia and thrombosis, and to find out why it frequently affects obese, diabetics, and elderly patients. RESULTS: The analysis shows that hepcidin could represent one of such correlating factors. Hepcidin is most elevated in older age, in non-insulin diabetics patients and in obese people. It is the final target therapy of many medicaments frequently used. Viral disease, and in particular SARS-CoV19, could induce activation of the hepcidin pathway, which in turn is responsible for an increase in the iron load. Excess of iron can lead to cell death by ferroptosis and release into the bloodstream, such as free iron, which in turn has toxic and pro-coagulative effects. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of hepcidin and iron overload might play a crucial role in COVID infection, becoming potential targets for treatment. Hepcidin could also be considered as a biomarker to measure the effectiveness of our treatments and the restoration of iron homeostasis the final intent.

In this regard, in silico method plays an important role, as it is rapid and cost effective compared to the trial and error methods using experimental studies. Natural products are safe and easily available to treat coronavirus affected patients, in the present alarming situation. In this paper five phytochemicals, which belong to flavonoid and anthraquinone subclass, have been selected as small molecules in molecular docking study of spike protein of SARS-CoV2 with its human receptor ACE2 molecule. Their molecular binding sites on spike protein bound structure with its receptor have been analyzed. From this analysis, hesperidin, emodin and chrysin are selected as competent natural products from both Indian and Chinese medicinal plants, to treat COVID-19. Among them, the phytochemical hesperidin can bind with ACE2 protein and bound structure of ACE2 protein and spike protein of SARS-CoV2 noncompetitively. The binding sites of ACE2 protein for spike protein and hesperidin, are located in different parts of ACE2 protein. Ligand spike protein causes conformational change in three-dimensional structure of protein ACE2, which is confirmed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies. This compound modulates the binding energy of bound structure of ACE2 and spike protein. This result indicates that due to presence of hesperidin, the bound structure of ACE2 and spike protein fragment becomes unstable. As a result, this natural product can impart antiviral activity in SARS CoV2 infection. The antiviral activity of these five natural compounds are further experimentally validated with QSAR study.","Basu, Anamika; Sarkar, Anasua; Maulik, Ujjwal",Sci Rep,305,1

Here we describe the identification and crystal structures of four distinct α-helical domains derived from the highly conserved heptad-repeat (HR) regions of the S2 fusion subunit. The four domains are an antiparallel four-stranded coiled coil, a parallel trimeric coiled coil, a four-helix bundle, and a six-helix bundle that is likely the final fusogenic form of the protein. When considered together, the structural and thermodynamic features of the four domains suggest a possible mechanism whereby the HR regions, initially sequestered in the native S glycoprotein spike, are released and refold sequentially to promote membrane fusion. Our results provide a structural framework for understanding the control of membrane fusion and should guide efforts to intervene in the SARS coronavirus entry process.","Deng, Yiqun; Liu, Jie; Zheng, Qi; Yong, Wei; Lu, Min",Structure,305,32

However, the duration and the effectiveness of the protection conferred by the immune response against future infection remains to be assessed in a large population. Objective: To estimate the incidence of newly acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections in seropositiveindividuals from a population-based sample as compared to seronegative controls. Design: Retrospective longitudinal propensity-score matched cohort study. Setting: A seroprevalence survey including a population-based representative sample of the population from the canton of Geneva (Switzerland) was conducted between April and June 2020, immediately after the first pandemic wave. Each individual included in the seroprevalence survey was linked to a state centralized registry compiling virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections since the beginning of the pandemic. Participants: Participants aged twelve years old and over, who developed anti-spike IgG antibodies were matched one-to-two to seronegative controls, using a propensity-score including age, gender, immunodeficiency, body mass index, smoking status and education level. Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Main outcomes and measures: Our primary outcome was virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections which occurred from serological status assessment in April-June 2020 to the end of the second pandemic wave (January 2021). Additionally, incidence of infections, rate of testing and proportion of positive tests were analysed. Results: Among 8344 serosurvey participants, 498 seropositive individuals were selected and matched with 996 seronegative controls. After a mean follow-up of 35.6 (Standard Deviation, SD: 3.2) weeks, 7 out of 498 (1.4%) seropositive subjects had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, of which 5 (1.0%) were considered as reinfections. By contrast, infection rate was significantly higher in seronegative individuals (15.5%, 154/996) during a similar mean follow-up of 34.7 (SD 3.2) weeks, corresponding to a 94% (95%CI 86% to 98%, P<0.001) reduction in the hazard of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test for seropositive subjects. Conclusions and relevance: Seroconversion after SARS-CoV-2 infection confers protection to successive viral contamination lasting at least 8 months. These findings could help global health authorities establishing priority for vaccine allocation.","Leidi, A.; Koegler, F.; Dumont, R.; Dubos, R.; Zaballa, M.-E.; Piumatti, G.; Coen, M.; Berner, A.; Darbellay Farhoumand, P.; Vetter, P.; Vuilleumier, N.; Kaiser, L.; Courvoisier, D.; Azman, A.; Guessous, I.; Stringhini, S.",,305,15

It is unclear whether some respiratory support devices may increase the dispersion of infectious bioaerosols and thereby place healthcare workers at increased risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objectives: To quantitatively compare viral dispersion from invasive and noninvasive respiratory support modalities. Methods: This study used a simulated ICU room with a breathing-patient simulator exhaling nebulized bacteriophages from the lower respiratory tract with various respiratory support modalities: invasive ventilation (through an endotracheal tube with an inflated cuff connected to a mechanical ventilator), helmet ventilation with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) valve, noninvasive bilevel positive-pressure ventilation, nonrebreather face masks, high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO), and nasal prongs. Measurements and Main Results: Invasive ventilation and helmet ventilation with a PEEP valve were associated with the lowest bacteriophage concentrations in the air, and HFNO and nasal prongs were associated with the highest concentrations. At the intubating position, bacteriophage concentrations associated with HFNO (2.66 × 10(4) plaque-forming units [PFU]/L of air sampled), nasal prongs (1.60 × 10(4) PFU/L of air sampled), nonrebreather face masks (7.87 × 10(2) PFU/L of air sampled), and bilevel positive airway pressure (1.91 × 10(2) PFU/L of air sampled) were significantly higher than those associated with invasive ventilation (P < 0.05 for each). The difference between bacteriophage concentrations associated with helmet ventilation with a PEEP valve (4.29 × 10(–1) PFU/L of air sampled) and bacteriophage concentrations associated with invasive ventilation was not statistically significant. Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential differential risk of dispersing virus among respiratory support devices and the importance of appropriate infection prevention and control practices and personal protective equipment for healthcare workers when caring for patients with transmissible respiratory viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2.","Avari, Hamed; Hiebert, Ryan J.; Ryzynski, Agnes A.; Levy, Ariela; Nardi, Julie; Kanji-Jaffer, Hasina; Kiiza, Peter; Pinto, Ruxandra; Plenderleith, Simon W.; Fowler, Robert A.; Mbareche, Hamza; Mubareka, Samira",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,305,1

Recognition of the epidemiologic circumstances involved in zoonotic spillover, amplification, and spread of diseases is essential for prioritizing surveillance and predicting future disease emergence risk. We examine the animal hosts and transmission mechanisms involved in spillover of zoonotic viruses to date, and discover that viruses with high host plasticity (i.e. taxonomically and ecologically diverse host range) were more likely to amplify viral spillover by secondary human-to-human transmission and have broader geographic spread. Viruses transmitted to humans during practices that facilitate mixing of diverse animal species had significantly higher host plasticity. Our findings suggest that animal-to-human spillover of new viruses that are capable of infecting diverse host species signal emerging disease events with higher pandemic potential in that these viruses are more likely to amplify by human-to-human transmission with spread on a global scale.","Kreuder Johnson, Christine; Hitchens, Peta L.; Smiley Evans, Tierra; Goldstein, Tracey; Thomas, Kate; Clements, Andrew; Joly, Damien O.; Wolfe, Nathan D.; Daszak, Peter; Karesh, William B.; Mazet, Jonna K.",Sci Rep,305,20

A total of 290 subjects aged 19–29 years old were recruited from 20 public universities in Malaysia via snowball sampling. Data was collected through an online questionnaire which consisted of socio-demographic status, use of OFD apps (most frequently used brand, usage frequency, food choice, and expenditure per transaction), factors affecting food choice in OFD apps, consumers' perceptions of healthy food availability in OFD apps and recommendation for improvements. The most frequently used apps among the subjects was Food Panda (46.6%), however, majority of the subjects in this study (41.4%) rarely used OFD apps. Also, most of the subjects ordered unhealthy food (77.6%) and spent up to RM15–RM19 for each transaction (43.1%). There was no significant difference between the use of OFD apps and gender (p > 0.05). Among the five food choice motives, “price and convenience” motive was the most influencing food choice factor in OFD apps. Majority of the subjects (76.9%) had a negative perception of healthy food availability (variety, price, and quality of healthy food) in OFD apps. No significant association was found between consumers' perceptions of healthy food availability in OFD apps and their food choices made in OFD apps among the subjects in this study (p > 0.05). Also, majority (85.9%) responded they are keen to purchase healthy foods through OFD apps if they are given an option. However, most Malaysian public university students perceived that there were not much variety of healthy food, of good quality and affordable price, available in OFD apps. This finding suggests that the online food environment in Malaysia are perceived as unhealthy. Future studies can explore the online food environment particularly its impact on community health and well-being. Public health professionals and policymakers need to address the online food environment issues as part of the obesogenic food environment in Malaysia especially when OFD is one of the most convenient service in this country.","Eu, Elisa Zhen Rong; Sameeha, Mohd Jamil",Front Nutr,305,1

Decontamination of PPE could be useful to maintain adequate supplies, but there is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of decontamination technologies. METHODS: A modification of the American Society for Testing and Materials standard quantitative carrier disk test method (ASTM E-2197-11) was used to examine the effectiveness of 3 methods, including ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light, a high-level disinfection cabinet that generates aerosolized peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, and dry heat at 70°C for 30 minutes. We assessed the decontamination of 3 commercial N95 respirators inoculated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and bacteriophages MS2 and Phi6; the latter is an enveloped RNA virus used as a surrogate for coronaviruses. Three and 6 log(10) reductions on respirators were considered effective for decontamination and disinfection, respectively. RESULTS: UV-C administered as a 1-minute cycle in a UV-C box or a 30-minute cycle by a room decontamination device reduced contamination but did not meet criteria for decontamination of the viruses from all sites on the N95s. The high-level disinfection cabinet was effective for decontamination of the N95s and achieved disinfection with an extended 31-minute cycle. Dry heat at 70°C for 30 minutes was not effective for decontamination of the bacteriophages. CONCLUSIONS: UV-C could be useful to reduce contamination on N95 respirators. However, the UV-C technologies studied did not meet pre-established criteria for decontamination under the test conditions used. The high-level disinfection cabinet was more effective and met criteria for disinfection with an extended cycle.","Cadnum, Jennifer L.; Li, Daniel F.; Redmond, Sarah N.; John, Amrita R.; Pearlmutter, Basya; Donskey, Curtis J.",Pathog Immun,305,32

Expeditious research on the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, one of the latest discovered coronaviruses that infect humans, has provided valuable insights into the molecular aspects of cell‐death regulation during infection. Apoptosis was observed in vitro, while both apoptosis and necrosis were observed in tissues obtained from SARS patients. Viral proteins that can regulate apoptosis have been identified, and many of these also have the abilities to interfere with cellular functions. Occurrence of cell death in host cells during infection by other coronaviruses, such as the mouse hepatitis virus and transmissible porcine gastroenteritis virus, has also being extensively studied. The diverse cellular responses to infection revealed the complex manner by which coronaviruses affect cellular homeostasis and modulate cell death. As a result of the complex interplay between virus and host, infection of different cell types by the same virus does not necessarily activate the same cell‐death pathway. Continuing research will lead to a better understanding of the regulation of cell death during viral infection and the identification of novel antiviral targets.","Tan, Yee‐Joo; Lim, Seng Gee; Hong, Wanjin",Cell Microbiol,305,0

However, older people who delegate their food activities (food purchasing, cooking…) have been reported to have a worse nutritional status than people who take care of their food activities. In this context, we will conduct a systematic review of all studies related to the nutritional issue in home-delivered meal older recipients. Methods: In June 2020, we searched 3 databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, EMBASE) to identify studies from all years on older adults at home and receiving home-delivered meal services (population). The following outcomes were considered: nutritional status (Body Mass Index, weight, undernutrition) and nutritional intake. Any nutritional intervention, comparator, and study design were relevant for inclusion. Results: Forty-eight original studies met the inclusion criteria, most of them being published after the year 2000 (n = 34) and undertaken in the USA (n = 32). The selection includes 30 cross-sectional and 18 longitudinal studies. The main findings of this review are the following: (1) home-delivery meal older recipients are at high risk of undernutrition; (2) providing home-delivery meals may improve the nutritional status and nutrient intake; (3) this improvement is even higher when the home-delivery meal service is improved, for instance by providing dietetic counseling or adding supplementary snacks/meals or enriched food. However, even an improved service does not allow all the older recipients meeting their recommended nutritional allowance. Conclusion: This review reveals a need to further develop strategies allowing home-delivery meal older recipients to fulfill their nutritional needs. From a methodological point of view, there is a need to describe in more detail the home-delivered services provided to studies' participants to better consider meal frequency and meal content in the results.","Fleury, Ségolène; Tronchon, Paul; Rota, Juliane; Meunier, Charlotte; Mardiros, Oliver; Van Wymelbeke-Delannoy, Virginie; Sulmont-Rossé, Claire",Front Nutr,305,4

Its causes and mechanisms are diverse and complex, and it is still unavoidable in clinical work. There is a high incidence of ED after otorhinolaryngology surgery, which may result from the sudden loss of functional senses and discomfort of surgical organs. This study aims to test a non-invasive, non-drug treatment modality of nose clamping and mouth-breathing training before surgery to reduce ED.

Study participants will be randomly assigned in two groups with a 1:1 ratio. The pretreatment group (P-group) will receive an intervention by nasal splint and mouth-breathing training before surgery, while the control group (C-group) will not receive any intervention; following which both groups will undergo FESS under general anaesthesia in accordance with the same anaesthesia scheme. After surgery, we will perform a single-blinded assessment of ED occurrence with stratification. IBM SPSS Statistics V.20 statistical software will be used for statistical analyses.

Availability of laboratory COVID-19 testing capacity using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was essential for case detection. Hence, it was critical to establish and expand this capacity to test for COVID-19 in Ethiopia. To this end, using a three-phrased approach, potential public and private laboratories with RT-PCR technology were assessed, capacitated with trained human resource and equipped as required. These laboratories were verified to conduct COVID-19 testing with quality assurance checks regularly conducted. Within a 10-month period, COVID-19 testing laboratories increased from zero to 65 in all Regional States with the capacity to conduct 18,454 tests per day. The success of this rapid countrywide expansion of laboratory testing capacity for COVID-19 depended on some key operational implications: the strong laboratory coordination network within the country, the use of non-virologic laboratories, investment in capacity building, digitalization of the data for better information management and establishing quality assurance checks. A weak supply chain for laboratory reagents and consumables, differences in the brands of COVID-19 test kits, frequent breakdowns of the PCR machines and inadequate number of laboratory personnel following the adaption of a 24/7 work schedule were some of the challenges experienced during the process of laboratory expansion. Overall, we learn that multisectoral involvement of laboratories from non-health sectors, an effective supply chain system with an insight into the promotion of local production of laboratory supplies were critical during the laboratory expansion for COVID-19 testing. The consistent support from WHO and other implementing partners to Member States is needed in building the capacity of laboratories across different diagnostic capabilities in line with International Health Regulations. This will enable efficient adaptation to respond to future public health emergencies.","Kebede, Adisu; Lanyero, Betty; Beyene, Berhane; Mandalia, Mayur Lalji; Melese, Daniel; Girmachew, Feven; Mekonnen, Adamu; Ayana, Gonfa; Yemanebirhan, Nebiyou; Hailu, Getnet; Asrat, Habtamu; Nurahmed, Negash; Gashu, Andargachew; Eshetu, Kirubel; Assefa, Zewdu; Abayneh, Aschalew; Musa, Emmanuel; Abate, Ebba",Pan Afr Med J,305,3

Since the turn of the century, various organizations have funded non‐governmental organizations (NGOs) in Ukraine to provide PWID with needles and syringes, condoms, HIV and HCV testing, and improve linkage to opioid agonist therapy (OAT) and HIV treatment. We investigated whether contact with these NGOs was associated with improved HIV prevention and treatment outcomes among PWID. METHODS: Five rounds of respondent‐driven sampled integrated bio‐behavioural survey data (2009 [N = 3962], 2011 [N = 9069], 2013 [N = 9502], 2015 [N = 9405], and 2017 [N = 10076]) among PWID in Ukraine (including HIV/HCV testing and questionnaires) were analysed using mixed‐effect logistic regression models (mixed‐effects: city, year). These regression models assessed associations between being an NGO client and various behavioural, OAT, HIV testing and HIV treatment outcomes, adjusting for demographic characteristics (age, gender, lifetime imprisonment, registration in a drug abuse clinic, education level). We also assessed associations between being an NGO client and being HIV positive or HCV positive, likewise adjusting for demographic characteristics (as above). RESULTS: NGO clients were more likely to have received HIV testing ever (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 5.37, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 4.97 to 5.80) or in the last year (aOR 3.37, 95% CI: 3.20 to 3.54), to have used condoms at last sexual intercourse (aOR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.30 to 1.44) and sterile needles at last injection (aOR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.20 to 1.56), to be currently (aOR 4.19, 95% CI: 3.48 to 5.05) or ever (aOR 2.52, 95% CI: 2.32 to 2.74) on OAT, and to have received syringes (aOR 109.89, 95% CI: 99.26 to 121.66) or condoms (aOR 54.39, 95% CI: 50.17 to 58.96) in the last year. PWID who were HIV positive (aOR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.33 to 1.48) or HCV positive (aOR 1.57, 95% CI: 1.49 to 1.65) were more likely to have contact with NGOs, with HIV positive PWID in contact with NGOs being more likely to be registered at AIDS centres (aOR 2.34, 95% CI: 1.88 to 2.92) and to be on antiretroviral therapy (aOR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.40 to 1.83). CONCLUSIONS: Contact with PWID targeted NGOs in Ukraine is associated with consistently better preventive, HIV testing and HIV treatment outcomes, suggesting a beneficial impact of harm reduction NGO programming.","Trickey, Adam; Semchuk, Nadiya; Saliuk, Tetiana; Sazonova, Yana; Varetska, Olga; Walker, Josephine G; Lim, Aaron G; Stone, Jack; Vickerman, Peter",J Int AIDS Soc,305,30

Rapid spread of COVID-19 has forced clinicians to care for patients with a highly contagious disease without evidence-based guidelines. Using a virtual modified nominal group technique, the Pediatric Difficult Intubation Collaborative (PeDI-C), which currently includes 35 hospitals from 6 countries, generated consensus guidelines on airway management in pediatric anesthesia based on expert opinion and early data about the disease. PeDI-C identified overarching goals during care, including minimizing aerosolized respiratory secretions, minimizing the number of clinicians in contact with a patient, and recognizing that undiagnosed asymptomatic patients may shed the virus and infect health care workers. Recommendations include administering anxiolytic medications, intravenous anesthetic inductions, tracheal intubation using video laryngoscopes and cuffed tracheal tubes, use of in-line suction catheters, and modifying workflow to recover patients from anesthesia in the operating room. Importantly, PeDI-C recommends that anesthesiologists consider using appropriate personal protective equipment when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures in asymptomatic children, in addition to known or suspected children with COVID-19. Airway procedures should be done in negative pressure rooms when available. Adequate time should be allowed for operating room cleaning and air filtration between surgical cases. Research using rigorous study designs is urgently needed to inform safe practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Until further information is available, PeDI-C advises that clinicians consider these guidelines to enhance the safety of health care workers during airway management when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures. These guidelines have been endorsed by the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia and the Canadian Pediatric Anesthesia Society.","Matava, Clyde T.; Kovatsis, Pete G.; Summers, Jennifer Lee; Castro, Pilar; Denning, Simon; Yu, Julie; Lockman, Justin L.; Von Ungern-Sternberg, Britta; Sabato, Stefano; Lee, Lisa K.; Ayad, Ihab; Mireles, Sam; Lardner, David; Whyte, Simon; Szolnoki, Judit; Jagannathan, Narasimhan; Thompson, Nicole; Stein, Mary Lyn; Dalesio, Nicholas; Greenberg, Robert; McCloskey, John; Peyton, James; Evans, Faye; Haydar, Bishr; Reynolds, Paul; Chiao, Franklin; Taicher, Brad; Templeton, Thomas; Bhalla, Tarun; Raman, Vidya T.; Garcia-Marcinkiewicz, Annery; Gálvez, Jorge; Tan, Jonathan; Rehman, Mohamed; Crockett, Christy; Olomu, Patrick; Szmuk, Peter; Glover, Chris; Matuszczak, Maria; Galvez, Ignacio; Hunyady, Agnes; Polaner, David; Gooden, Cheryl; Hsu, Grace; Gumaney, Harshad; Pérez-Pradilla, Caroline; Kiss, Edgar E.; Theroux, Mary C.; Lau, Jennifer; Asaf, Saeedah; Ingelmo, Pablo; Engelhardt, Thomas; Hervías, Mónica; Greenwood, Eric; Javia, Luv; Disma, Nicola; Yaster, Myron; Fiadjoe, John E.",Anesth Analg,305,26

Despite that those drugs are known to cause prolonged QT interval individually there is no study assessing the impact of this combination on electrocardiography (ECG). This study aimed to assess the impact of a 5-day course of HCQ and azithromycin combination on ECG in non-ICU COVID19(+) patients. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we enrolled 109 COVID19(+) patients who required non-ICU hospitalization. All patients received 5-day protocol of HCQ and azithromycin combination. On-treatment ECGs were repeated 3-6 h after the second HCQ loading dose and 48-72 h after the first dose of the combination. ECGs were assessed in terms of rhythm, PR interval, QRS duration, QT and QTc intervals. Baseline and on-treatment ECG findings were compared. Demographic characteristics, laboratory results were recorded. Daily phone call-visit or bed-side visit were performed by attending physician. RESULTS: Of the 109 patients included in the study, the mean age was 57.3 ± 14.4 years and 48 (44%) were male. Mean baseline PR interval was 158.47 ± 25.10 ms, QRS duration was 94.00 ± 20.55 ms, QTc interval was 435.28 ± 32.78 ms, 415.67 ± 28.51, 412.07 ± 25.65 according to Bazett's, Fridericia's and Framingham Heart Study formulas respectively. ∆PR was −2.94 ± 19.93 ms (p = .55), ∆QRS duration was 5.18 ± 8.94 ms (p = .03). ∆QTc interval was 6.64 ± 9.60 ms (p = .5), 10.67 ± 9.9 ms (p = .19), 14.14 ± 9.68 ms (p = .16) according to Bazett's, Fridericia's and Framingham Heart Study formulas respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between QTc intervals. No ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation or significant conduction delay was seen during follow-up. There was no death or worsening heart function. CONCLUSION: The 5-day course of HCQ- AZM combination did not lead to clinically significant QT prolongation and other conduction delays compared to baseline ECG in non-ICU COVID19(+) patients.","Bakhshaliyev, Nijad; Uluganyan, Mahmut; Enhos, Asim; Karacop, Erdem; Ozdemir, Ramazan",J Electrocardiol,305,1

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Published studies in Medline from 1 January 2000 to 10 April 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Curative, neoadjuvant, and adjuvant indications for surgery, systemic treatment, or radiotherapy for cancers of the bladder, breast, colon, rectum, lung, cervix, and head and neck were included. The main outcome measure was the hazard ratio for overall survival for each four week delay for each indication. Delay was measured from diagnosis to first treatment, or from the completion of one treatment to the start of the next. The primary analysis only included high validity studies controlling for major prognostic factors. Hazard ratios were assumed to be log linear in relation to overall survival and were converted to an effect for each four week delay. Pooled effects were estimated using DerSimonian and Laird random effect models. RESULTS: The review included 34 studies for 17 indications (n=1 272 681 patients). No high validity data were found for five of the radiotherapy indications or for cervical cancer surgery. The association between delay and increased mortality was significant (P<0.05) for 13 of 17 indications. Surgery findings were consistent, with a mortality risk for each four week delay of 1.06-1.08 (eg, colectomy 1.06, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.12; breast surgery 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13). Estimates for systemic treatment varied (hazard ratio range 1.01-1.28). Radiotherapy estimates were for radical radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (hazard ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.14), adjuvant radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery (0.98, 0.88 to 1.09), and cervix cancer adjuvant radiotherapy (1.23, 1.00 to 1.50). A sensitivity analysis of studies that had been excluded because of lack of information on comorbidities or functional status did not change the findings. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer treatment delay is a problem in health systems worldwide. The impact of delay on mortality can now be quantified for prioritisation and modelling. Even a four week delay of cancer treatment is associated with increased mortality across surgical, systemic treatment, and radiotherapy indications for seven cancers. Policies focused on minimising system level delays to cancer treatment initiation could improve population level survival outcomes.","Hanna, Timothy P; King, Will D; Thibodeau, Stephane; Jalink, Matthew; Paulin, Gregory A; Harvey-Jones, Elizabeth; O’Sullivan, Dylan E; Booth, Christopher M; Sullivan, Richard; Aggarwal, Ajay",BMJ,305,1

Type I IFNs can influence dendritic cell (DC) activation, maturation, migration, and survival, but also directly enhance natural killer (NK) and T/B cell activity, thus orchestrating various innate and adaptive immune effector functions. Therefore, type I IFNs have long been considered essential in the host defense against virus infections. More recently, it has become clear that depending on the type of virus and the course of infection, production of type I IFN can also lead to immunopathology or immunosuppression. Similarly, in bacterial infections type I IFN production is often associated with detrimental effects for the host. Although most cells in the body are thought to be able to produce type I IFN, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) have been termed the natural “IFN producing cells” due to their unique molecular adaptations to nucleic acid sensing and ability to produce high amounts of type I IFN. Findings from mouse reporter strains and depletion experiments in in vivo infection models have brought new insights and established that the role of pDCs in type I IFN production in vivo is less important than assumed. Production of type I IFN, especially the early synthesized IFNβ, is rather realized by a variety of cell types and cannot be mainly attributed to pDCs. Indeed, the cell populations responsible for type I IFN production vary with the type of pathogen, its tissue tropism, and the route of infection. In this review, we summarize recent findings from in vivo models on the cellular source of type I IFN in different infectious settings, ranging from virus, bacteria, and fungi to eukaryotic parasites. The implications from these findings for the development of new vaccination and therapeutic designs targeting the respectively defined cell types are discussed.","Ali, Shafaqat; Mann-Nüttel, Ritu; Schulze, Anja; Richter, Lisa; Alferink, Judith; Scheu, Stefanie",Front Immunol,305,1

In the context of the rapid global dissemination of the Covid-19 pandemic, describing viral infection rates in relation to international air travel early during the pandemic can help inform future public health policy. The objective of this study is to determine whether proximity to an international airport predicted higher infection rates during the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States (US). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the authors examined the incidence of Covid-19 in areas near US international airports in the first weeks after detection of Covid-19 in all 50 states, using publicly available county-level incidence of Covid-19 data. They performed a multiple regression to determine the relative effects of population density and air traffic in the Counties Containing Airports (CCA) and the number of Covid-19 cases, and determined the odds of Covid-19 in cities near airports and CCA compared to the rest of the state. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis revealed that air traffic was significantly correlated with Covid-19 cases during the initial phase of pandemic while population density was not significantly correlated. Three weeks into the pandemic, the pooled odds of Covid-19 cases in CCA was 2.66 (95%CI [2.64, 2.68], p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The counties in the US containing international airports represented initial hotspots for Covid-19 transmission. Early public health containment efforts focused on these areas may help mitigate disease transmission during future similar novel respiratory virus epidemics.","Chokshi, Aastha; Dalla-Piazza, Michelle; Zhang, Wei Wei; Sifri, Ziad",Travel Med Infect Dis,305,18

An online cross‐sectional survey was conducted on Pakistani citizens via the snowball sampling technique. A total of 377 respondents (256 males and 121 females) participated in this study from August to October 2020. Adapted scales were validated using confirmatory factor analysis, and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS‐SEM) was applied to the data to test the hypothesised model. The study's findings showed a negative relationship between fear of COVID‐19 and QOL. Likewise, a reciprocal relationship was found between situational depression and quality of life. The results indicate that fear of COVID‐19 and situational depression during the pandemic have affected the lives of Pakistani citizens. The findings are particularly relevant for improving the QOL by limiting the information received from media and social networks. There is a need to control these mediums and promote community‐based interventions to provide accurate knowledge regarding COVID‐19. Fear of COVID‐19 and situational depression may be reduced in this way. Based on the current findings, psychotherapy and counselling programmes must be planned to minimise the adverse effects of fear of COVID‐19 and depression on the QOL of citizens due to the ongoing progression of the pandemic.","Ashraf, Muhammad Umair; Raza, Saqlain; Ashraf, Asfa; Mehmood, Waqas; Patwary, Ataul Karim",J Public Aff,305,16

However, less is known about the excess all-cause mortality and air pollution-human activity responses. This study estimated the weekly excess all-cause mortality during COVID-19 and evaluated the impacts of air pollution and human activities on mortality variations during the 10th to 52nd weeks of 2020 among sixteen countries. A SARIMA model was adopted to estimate the mortality benchmark based on short-term mortality during 2015–2019 and calculate excess mortality. A quasi-likelihood Poisson-based GAM model was further applied for air pollution/human activity response evaluation, namely ground-level NO(2) and PM(2.5) and the visit frequencies of parks and workplaces. The findings showed that, compared with COVID-19 mortality (i.e., cause-specific mortality), excess all-cause mortality changed from −26.52% to 373.60% during the 10th to 52nd weeks across the sixteen countries examined, revealing higher excess all-cause mortality than COVID-19 mortality in most countries. For the impact of air pollution and human activities, the average country-level relative risk showed that one unit increase in weekly NO(2), PM(2.5), park visits and workplace visits was associated with approximately 1.54% increase and 0.19%, 0.23%, and 0.23% decrease in excess all-cause mortality, respectively. Moreover, compared with the impact on COVID-19 mortality, the relative risks of weekly NO(2) and PM(2.5) were lower, and the relative risks of weekly park and workplace visits were higher for excess all-cause mortality. These results suggest that the estimation based on excess all-cause mortality reduced the potential impact of air pollution and enhanced the influence of human activities compared with the estimation based on COVID-19 mortality.","Meng, Yuan; Wong, Man Sing; Xing, Hanfa; Kwan, Mei-Po; Zhu, Rui",Int J Environ Res Public Health,305,16

Recombination junctions that were identified in clinical strains of this study, as well as in clinical strains of previous studies, were superimposed on RNA secondary structure models of 2C and 3D genomic regions. Furthermore, we created an in vitro model, based on double infection of cell-culture with two poliovirus strains, for the production and identification of recombinant Sabin strains in 2C and 3D regions. Our intention was to compare the results that refer to the correlation of recombination junctions and RNA secondary structures in 2C and 3D regions of clinical strains, with the respective results of the in vitro model. Most of the recombination junctions of the clinical strains were correlated with RNA secondary structure elements, which were identical between recombining Sabin strains, and also presented high predictive value. In consensus were, the respective results originated from the in vitro model. We propose that the distribution of specific types of recombination junctions in certain regions of Sabin strains is not fortuitous and is correlated with RNA secondary structure elements identical to both recombination partners. Furthermore, results of this study highlight an important role for the stem region of the RNA structure elements in promoting recombination.

Care and nursing homes have become the sites of greatest concentration of cases. We intended to review 30-day mortality of COVID-19 patients with hip fractures. This is relevant given the disease impact in this age group. METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies linked to mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 patients who have undergone non-elective hip surgeries using the keywords “COVID-19”OR “SARS-cov-2”OR “Coronavirus Infections”; AND “Surgery”OR “Hip”OR “Fracture”OR “Orthopedics.” We included all patients with hip fractures, but excluded pathological fractures and other non-traumatic hip pathologies. Four-hundred and eighty-one articles were identified for screening, in addition to an unpublished case-series of 67 patients that have 3 cases turned positive for COVID 19, yielding a total of 50patients for the final review. RESULTS: The study included 4 articles published until May 9th 2020 and a case-series: 26(52%) patients were females; the median age was 86years; hypertension(53.6%), diabetes mellitus type II(28.6%), and coronary artery heart disease(25%) were the most common comorbidities; 34(68%) patients had intertrochanteric hip fracture and 16(32%) patients had femoral neck fractures; 22(59.5%) patients underwent cephalomedullary nail fixation, 12(32.4%) patients had hemiarthroplasty, and for 3(8.1%) patients, the type of surgery was not documented; 20(40%) patients died(12patients died before the surgery and 8died after surgery at a median time of 3days), 29(76.3%) patients had an unremarkable course throughout hospitalization and were discharged including 1(2.6%) patient managed non-operatively, and 1(2.6%) patient was admitted to the ICU after the surgery but eventually discharged. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infected elderly patients have a higher 30-days mortality rate compared to non-COVID-19 infected cases. Further studies are warranted to look at the morbidity and mortality rates in COVID-19 positive patients with hip fractures and to investigate how these outcomes can be improved.

Open science (OS) is described as an open commons, in which a right to science renders all possible scientific data for everyone to access and use. In this common space, capitalist platforms now provide many essential services and are taking the lead in public health activities. These neoliberal businesses, however, have a problematic role in the capture of public goods. This paper argues that the open commons is a community of rights, consisting of people and institutions whose interests mutually support the public good. If OS is a cornerstone of public health, then reaffirming the public good is its overriding purpose, and unethical platforms ought to be excluded from the commons and its benefits.","CAPPS, BENJAMIN",Cambridge quarterly of healthcare ethics : CQ : the international journal of healthcare ethics committees,305,16

Further, that the debate in the use of person-first language versus identity-first language should centre first and foremost on the needs, autonomy, and rights of autistic people, so in to preserve their rights to self-determination. Lastly, we provide directions for future research.","Botha, Monique; Hanlon, Jacqueline; Williams, Gemma Louise",J Autism Dev Disord,305,1

Along with human beings, several species of wild and pet animals have been demonstrated to be infected by SARS‐CoV‐2, both naturally and experimentally. In addition, with constant emergence of new variants, the species susceptibility might further change which warrants intensified screening efforts. India is a vast and second most populated country, with a habitat of a very diverse range of animal species. In this study we place on record of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections in three captive Asiatic lions. Detailed genomic characterization revealed involvement of Delta mutant (Pango lineage B.1.617.2) of SARS‐CoV‐2 at two different locations. Interestingly, no other feline species enclosed in the zoo/park were found infected. The epidemiological and molecular analysis will contribute to the understanding of the emerging mutants of SARS‐CoV‐2 in wild and domestic animals.","Karikalan, M.; Chander, V.; Mahajan, S.; Deol, P.; Agrawal, R.

Besides future prospects for building lunar gateways as support to human space flight, the Moon is an attractive location for scientific purposes. Not only will its study give insight on the foundations of the Solar System but also its location, uncontaminated by the Earth's ionosphere, represents a vantage point for the observation of the Sun and planetary bodies outside the Solar System. Lunar exploration has been traditionally conducted by means of single-agent robotic assets, which is a limiting factor for the return of scientific missions. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) is developing fundamental technologies towards increased autonomy of robotic explorers to fulfil more complex mission tasks through cooperation. This paper presents an overview of past, present and future activities of DLR towards highly autonomous systems for scientific missions targeting the Moon and other planetary bodies. The heritage from the Mobile Asteroid Scout (MASCOT), developed jointly by DLR and CNES and deployed on asteroid Ryugu on 3 October 2018 from JAXA's Hayabusa2 spacecraft, inspired the development of novel core technologies towards higher efficiency in planetary exploration. Together with the lessons learnt from the ROBEX project (2012–2017), where a mobile robot autonomously deployed seismic sensors at a Moon analogue site, this experience is shaping the future steps towards more complex space missions. They include the development of a mobile rover for JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) in 2024 as well as demonstrations of novel multi-robot technologies at a Moon analogue site on the volcano Mt Etna in the ARCHES project. Within ARCHES, a demonstration mission is planned from the 14 June to 10 July 2021,(1) during which heterogeneous teams of robots will autonomously conduct geological and mineralogical analysis experiments and deploy an array of low-frequency antennas to measure Jovian and solar bursts.

It is important to achieve high COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates in this group as soon as a vaccine is available. As future healthcare providers, they will be entrusted with providing vaccine recommendations and counseling vaccine-hesitant patients. METHODS: This project used self-report to assess vaccine hesitancy and acceptance among medical students towards the novel COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: Nearly all participants had positive attitudes towards vaccines and agreed they would likely be exposed to COVID-19; however, only 53% indicated they would participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial and 23% were unwilling to take a COVID-19 vaccine immediately upon FDA approval. Students willing to immediately take the vaccine were more likely to trust public health experts, have fewer concerns about side effects and agree with vaccine mandates (P < 0.05). Concern for serious side effects was independently predictive of lower odds of intent to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial (AOR = 0.41, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among US medical students and highlights the need for an educational curriculum about the safety and effectiveness to promote uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine.","Lucia, Victoria C; Kelekar, Arati; Afonso, Nelia M",J Public Health (Oxf),305,22
