OBJECTIVES: A systematic description of a seasonal influenza patient population at a German university hospital to improve risk stratification and clinical care. METHODS: In this monocentric, retrospective observational study of the 2017/2018 influenza season at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, patients with confirmed influenza infection were included. RESULTS: Of all influenza swabs performed in the emergency department, 24% (n = 162/676) were positive. A total of 255 patients (median age 66 years) had an influenza infection (influenza A n = 79, influenza B n = 176); 27 (15.3%) were nosocomial infections. Of the 179 (70.2%) patients that were hospitalized, 51 (20%) received intensive medical care. Patients with subsequent need for intensive care had an elevated CRP level (69.5 mg/dl [SD 62.8] vs. 141.7 [SD 127.2] mg/dl) at the time of influenza diagnosis and more frequent infiltrates in X‑ray/CT of the thorax (n = 43 [33.6%] vs. n = 43 [84.3%]). Antiviral therapy with oseltamivir was administered for 74 (29.0%) patients and 11 (6.1%) patients were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Of the 23 (9.0%) patients who died, only four of them had been vaccinated (trivalent). Those four had an influenza B infection. CONCLUSION: The structured use of diagnostic tests (influenza PCR, X‑ray/CT chest and CRP) and antiviral therapy (oseltamivir) as well as targeted management of admission, intensive care capacities, and an increase in vaccination rates are important for improving patient care and optimizing the use of resources during seasonal influenza epidemics.","Kraef, Christian; van der Meirschen, Marc; Wichmann, Dominic; Kutza, Meike; Restemeyer, Cordula; Addo, Marylyn M.; Lohse, Ansgar W.; Schmiedel, Stefan; Kluge, Stefan; Schulze zur Wiesch, Julian",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,579,1

ORFs 2 to 7 were cloned in plasmids downstream of the Sp6 RNA polymerase promoter, and the translation of transcripts generated in vitro yielded proteins that could be immunoprecipitated with porcine anti-LV serum. Synthetic polypeptides of 15 to 17 amino acids were selected from the amino acid sequences of ORFs 2 to 7 and antipeptide sera were raised in rabbits. Antisera that immunoprecipitated the in vitro translation products of ORFs 2 to 5 and 7 were obtained. Sera containing antibodies directed against peptides from ORFs 3 to 7 reacted positively with LV-infected alveolar lung macrophages in the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. Using these antipeptide sera and porcine anti-LV serum, we identified three structural proteins and assigned their corresponding genes. Virions were found to contain a nucleocapsid protein of 15 kDa (N), an unglycosylated membrane protein of 18 kDa (M), and a glycosylated membrane protein of 25 kDa (E). The N protein is encoded by ORF7, the M protein is encoded by ORF6, and the E protein is encoded by ORF5. The E protein in virus particles contains one or two N-glycans that are resistant to endo-β-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase H. This finding indicates that the high-mannose glycans are processed into complex glycans in the Golgi compartment. The protein composition of the LV virions further confirms that LV is evolutionarily related to equine arteritis virus, simian hemorrhagic fever virus, and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus.","Meulenberg, Janneke J.M.; Petersen-Den Besten, Annelien; De Kluyver, Eric P.; Moormann, Rob J.M.; Schaaper, Wim M.M.; Wensvoort, Gert",Virology,579,22

The role of specific pathways of virus entry and release in the pathogenesis of viral infection is examined together with the mechanisms utilized by viruses to circumvent the epithelial barrier. Polarized epithelial cells in culture, which can be grown on permeable supports, provide excellent systems for investigating the events in virus entry and release at the cellular level, and much information is being obtained using such systems. Much remains to be learned about the precise routes by which many viruses traverse the epithelial barrier to initiate their natural infection processes, although important information has been obtained in some systems. Another area of great interest for future investigation is the process of virus entry and release from other polarized cell types, including neuronal cells.","Tucker, Simon P.; Compans, Richard W.",Adv Virus Res,579,4

During the outbreak, there were widespread reports of plague patients presenting with atypical symptoms, such as prolonged duration of illness and upper respiratory tract symptoms. Reported mortality among plague cases was also substantially lower than that reported in the literature (25% versus 50% in treated patients). A prospective multicenter observational study was carried out to investigate potential reasons for these atypical presentations. Few subjects among our cohort had confirmed or probable plague, suggesting that, in part, there was overdiagnosis of plague cases by clinicians. However, 35% subjects reported using an antibiotic with anti-plague activity before hospital admission, whereas 55% had antibiotics with anti-plague activity detected in their serum at admission. Although there may have been overdiagnosis of plague by clinicians during the outbreak, the high frequency of community antibiotic may partly explain the relatively few culture-positive sputum samples during the outbreak. Community antibiotic use may have also altered the clinical presentation of plague patients. These issues make accurate detection of patients and the development of clinical case definitions and triage algorithms in urban pneumonic plague outbreaks difficult.","Salam, Alex P.; Raberahona, Mihaja; Andriantsalama, Prisca; Read, Liam; Andrianarintsiferantsoa, Faraniaina; Razafinambinintsoa, Tiana; Rakotomalala, Rado; Hasiniatsy, Rodrigue N.

Numerous efforts have been made to develop drought-tolerant maize lines and to explore drought tolerant mechanisms in maize. However, there is a lack of comparative studies on transcriptomic changes between drought-tolerant and control maize lines. RESULTS: In the present study, we have developed a drought-tolerant maize mutant (C7–2t) by irradiating the seeds of maize inbred line ChangC7–2 (C7–2) with (60)Co-γ. Compared to its wild type C7–2, C7–2t exhibited a significantly delayed wilting and higher drought tolerance under both the controlled and field conditions, indicating its high water-holding ability. Transcriptomic profiling was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between C7–2 and C7–2t during drought. As a result, a total of 4552 DEGs were implied in drought tolerance of C7-2 and C7-2t. In particular, the expression of photosynthesis-related genes in C7–2 was inhibited, whereas these genes in C7–2t were almost unaffected under drought. Moreover, a specific set of the DEGs were involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and taurine (hypotaurine) metabolism in C7–2t; these DEGs were enriched in cell components associated with membrane systems and cell wall biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: The drought tolerance of C7–2t was largely due to its high water-holding ability, stable photosynthesis (for supporting osmoregulation) and strengthened biosynthesis of cell walls under drought conditions.","Zhang, Qinbin; Liu, Hui; Wu, Xiaolin; Wang, Wei",BMC Plant Biol,579,16

It is potentially harmful for the lung and the diaphragm, but its detection is challenging. Magnitude of effort generated by RT is currently unknown. Our objective was to validate supervised methods for automatic detection of RT using only airway pressure (Paw) and flow. A secondary objective was to describe the magnitude of the efforts generated during RT. METHODS: We developed algorithms for detection of RT using Paw and flow waveforms. Experts having Paw, flow and esophageal pressure (Pes) assessed automatic detection accuracy by comparison against visual assessment. Muscular pressure (Pmus) was measured from Pes during RT, triggered breaths and ineffective efforts. RESULTS: Tracings from 20 hypoxemic patients were used (mean age 65 ± 12 years, 65% male, ICU survival 75%). RT was present in 24% of the breaths ranging from 0 (patients paralyzed or in pressure support ventilation) to 93.3%. Automatic detection accuracy was 95.5%: sensitivity 83.1%, specificity 99.4%, positive predictive value 97.6%, negative predictive value 95.0% and kappa index of 0.87. Pmus of RT ranged from 1.3 to 36.8 cmH(2)0, with a median of 8.7 cmH(2)0. RT with breath stacking had the highest levels of Pmus, and RTs with no breath stacking were of similar magnitude than pressure support breaths. CONCLUSION: An automated detection tool using airway pressure and flow can diagnose reverse triggering with excellent accuracy. RT generates a median Pmus of 9 cmH(2)O with important variability between and within patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: BEARDS, NCT03447288.

This study considers how urban social inequities are distributed in terms of burdens and benefits by quantifying exposure through an urban heat risk index (UHRI), and proximity to greenspace through the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), at the ward level in Delhi. Landsat derived remote sensing imagery for May and September 2011 is used in a sensitivity analysis of varying seasonal exposure. Multivariable models based on generalized estimating equations (GEEs) reveal significant statistical associations (p < 0.05) between UHRI/NDVI and several indicators of social vulnerability. For example, the proportions of children (β = 0.922, p = 0.024) and agricultural workers (β = 0.394, p = 0.016) are positively associated with the May UHRI, while the proportions of households with assets (β = −1.978, p = 0.017) and households with electricity (β = −0.605, p = 0.010) are negatively associated with the May UHRI. In contrast, the proportions of children (β = 0.001, p = 0.633) and agricultural workers (β = 0.002, p = 0.356) are not significantly associated with the May NDVI, while the proportions of households with assets (β = 0.013, p = 0.010) and those with electricity (β = 0.008, p = 0.006) are positively associated with the May NDVI. Our findings emphasize the need for future research and policies to consider how socially vulnerable groups are inequitably exposed to the impact of climate change-related urban heat without the mitigating effects of greenspace.","Mitchell, Bruce C.; Chakraborty, Jayajit; Basu, Pratyusha",Int J Environ Res Public Health,579,1

Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase isoenzyme (UGT1A1) glucuronidates bilirubin and converts the toxic form of bilirubin to its nontoxic form. METHOD: A retrospective study was conducted to review clinical information of ABO hemolysis neonates (ABO HDN) admitted to the Department of Neonatology, referred for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, in a large general hospital of southern China from 2011 to 2017. Variation status of UGT1A1 was determined by direct sequencing or genotype assays. RESULT: Sixty-nine ABO HDNs were included into the final analysis. UGT1A1 c.211 G > A mutation (UGT1A1*6, p.Arg71Gly, rs4148323) was significantly associated with the increased bilirubin level in ABO HDNs, after adjusted by age, sex and feeding method (P = 0.019 for TBIL, P = 0.02 for IBIL). Moreover, heterozygous and/or homozygous UGT1A1 mutations in the coding sequence region were significantly associated with the increased risk of developing hazardous hyperbilirubinemia (as defined by TSB > 427 umol/L) as compared those with a normal UGT1A1 genotype (OR(adj) = 9.16, 95%CI 1.99–42.08, P = 0.002) in the study cohort.

Digital health interventions (DHIs) may improve patient health care self-management and outcomes. We aimed to determine if patients with AMI using a DHI have lower 30-day unplanned all-cause readmissions than a historical control. METHODS: This nonrandomized controlled trial with a historical control, conducted at 4 US hospitals from 2015 to 2019, included 1064 patients with AMI (DHI n=200, control n=864). The DHI integrated a smartphone application, smartwatch, and blood pressure monitor to support guideline-directed care during hospitalization and through 30-days post-discharge via (1) medication reminders, (2) vital sign and activity tracking, (3) education, and (4) outpatient care coordination. The Patient Activation Measure assessed patient knowledge, skills, and confidence for health care self-management. All-cause 30-day readmissions were measured through administrative databases. Propensity score–adjusted Cox proportional hazard models estimated hazard ratios of readmission for the DHI group relative to the control group. RESULTS: Following propensity score adjustment, baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the DHI versus control patients (standardized differences <0.07), including a mean age of 59.3 versus 60.1 years, 30% versus 29% Women, 70% versus 70% White, 54% versus 54% with private insurance, 61% versus 60% patients with a non ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and 15% versus 15% with high comorbidity burden. DHI patients were predominantly in the highest levels of patient activation for health care self-management (mean score 71.7±16.6 at 30 days). The DHI group had fewer all-cause 30-day readmissions than the control group (6.5% versus 16.8%, respectively). Adjusting for hospital site and a propensity score inclusive of age, sex, race, AMI type, comorbidities, and 6 additional confounding factors, the DHI group had a 52% lower risk for all-cause 30-day readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.26–0.88]). Similar results were obtained in a sensitivity analysis employing propensity matching. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in patients with AMI, the DHI may be associated with high patient activation for health care self-management and lower risk of all-cause unplanned 30-day readmissions.

Effective control of breathing ensures that the airway is protected, maintains volume homeostasis, and provides ventilation. Upper airway structures are effectors for all of these functions that affect the entire airway. Nasal functions include air conditioning and protective reflexes that can be exaggerated and involve circulatory changes. Oral cavity and pharyngeal patency enable airflow and feeding, but during sleep pharyngeal closure can result in apnea. Coordination of breathing with sucking and nutritive swallowing alters during development, while nonnutritive swallowing at all ages limits aspiration. Laryngeal functions in breathing include protection of the subglottic airway, active maintenance of its absolute volume, and control of tidal flow patterns. These are vital functions for normal lung growth in fetal life and during rapid adaptations to breathing challenges from birth through adulthood. Active central control of breathing focuses on the coordination of laryngeal and diaphragmatic activities, which adapts according to the integration of central and peripheral inputs. For the intensivist, knowledge of upper airway physiology can be applied to improve respiratory support. In a second part the mechanical properties of the respiratory system as a critical component of the chain of events that result in translation of the output of the respiratory rhythm generator to ventilation are described. A comprehensive understanding of respiratory mechanics is essential to the delivery of optimized and individualized mechanical ventilation. The basic elements of respiratory mechanics will be described and developmental changes in the airways, lungs, and chest wall that impact on measurement of respiratory mechanics with advancing postnatal age are reviewed. This will be follwowed by two sections, the first on respiratory mechanics in various neonatal pathologies and the second in pediatric pathologies. The latter can be classified in three categories. First, restrictive diseases may be of pulmonary origin, such as chronic interstitial lung diseases or acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, which are usually associated with reduced lung compliance. Restrictive diseases may also be due to chest wall abnormalities such as obesity or scoliosis (idiopathic or secondary to neuromuscular diseases), which are associated with a reduction in chest wall compliance. Second, obstructive diseases are represented by asthma and wheezing disorders, cystic fibrosis, long term sequelae of neonatal lung disease and bronchiolitis obliterans following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Obstructive diseases are defined by a reduced FEV1/VC ratio. Third, neuromuscular diseases, mainly represented by DMD and SMA, are associated with a decrease in vital capacity linked to respiratory muscle weakness that is better detected by PImax, PEmax and SNIP measurements.","Hutchison, Alastair A.; Leclerc, Francis; Nève, Véronique; Pillow, J.

In the majority of symptomatic cases, COVID-19 results in a mild disease predominantly characterised by upper respiratory tract symptoms. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a nasopharyngeal sample is the mainstay of diagnosis, but there is an ~30% false negative rate early in the disease and in patients with mild disease, and therefore repeat testing may be required. RT-PCR positivity can persist for several days after resolution of symptoms. IgM and IgG antibody responses become positive several days after the onset of symptoms, and robust antibody responses are detectable in the second week of illness. Antibody-based immunoassays have a limited role in the diagnosis of early symptomatic disease. However, their incremental benefit over RT-PCR in the first 2 weeks of illness is currently being clarified in ongoing studies. Such assays may be useful for surveillance purposes. However, their role in potentially selecting individuals who may benefit from vaccination, or as a biomarker identifying persons who could be redeployed into essential employment roles, is being investigated. Rapid antibody-based immunoassays that detect viral antigen in nasopharyngeal samples are being developed and evaluated.","Dheda, K; Jaumdally, S; Davids, M; Chang, J-W; Jina, P; Pooran, A; Makambwa, E; Esmail, A; Vardas, E; Presier, W",,579,16

The repercussions of the ongoing debate over accountability, and the purposes and limits of UN immunity, are likely to reverberate for years to come. Despite considerable attention from the international law community, however, almost none of the resulting scholarship has focused on the international health law aspects of the case. The international spread of the vast majority of infectious diseases has been the subject matter of international law only since the 2005 revision of the International Health Regulations (IHRs). By contrast, preventing the international transmission of cholera has been the object of multilateral state negotiation for over 160 years, resulting in it becoming the sole subject matter of not merely the first, but the first three binding international health law treaties over a century ago. Since that time, cholera prevention has remained an unbroken thread woven through the history of international health law, from the initial International Sanitary Conventions, through the formation of the World Health Organisation, and into the twenty-first century. The current iteration of the IHRs are today one of the most universally accepted sources of binding international legal obligations of any kind; as the only disease that has appeared in all previous iterations over nearly 125 years, preventing the transnational spread of cholera approaches customary international law status. This chapter builds upon these themes to re-examine the conduct of the United Nations through this lens. It explores UN standards, and actual UN practice, as they relate to medical guidance to peacekeeping missions, preventative measures for peacekeepers such as vaccination and prophylaxis, and treatment of sewage and sanitation. In doing so, it offers valuable lessons from the past and the present on how international law around infectious disease might be effectively implemented, and followed, in the future.","Houston, Adam Rainis",Infectious Diseases in the New Millennium,579,16

Such a notion acknowledges humanity’s reliance on technologies to transmute history, trauma, or memory, transforming technologies from medium and machine into artefacts for circulation and exchange. The transcendence of medium into artefacts as sites of trauma equally highlights the socio-political frames within which testimony is extracted and witnessing is enacted, unleashing trauma as a cultural form and a resonant genre of popular consumption. This paper, in tracing the trajectory of these technologies of trauma and its cultural turn from the sensorial to mass witnessing to the aesthetic regimes of immediacy in the digital age, comes to term with our machinic bind in releasing trauma and its aestheticization as a cultural artefact and the unethical challenges, which unfold in such a proposition. The development of print, photography, television, and digital platforms as technologies of trauma reiterates the popularization of trauma, witnessing and testimony as cultural forms reiterating how these are intimately implicated in our emergence as active consuming communities of trauma and in tandem how these remake us as vulnerable subjects through the circulation of trauma as a cultural form.","Ibrahim, Yasmin",Hu Arenas,579,16

Existing techniques for process variant analysis detect statistically-significant differences between variants at the level of individual entities (such as process activities) and their relationships (e.g. directly-follows relations between activities). This may lead to a proliferation of differences due to the low level of granularity in which such differences are captured. This paper presents a novel approach to detect statistically-significant differences between variants at the level of entire process traces (i.e. sequences of directly-follows relations). The cornerstone of this approach is a technique to learn a directly-follows graph called mutual fingerprint from the event logs of the two variants. A mutual fingerprint is a lossless encoding of a set of traces and their duration using discrete wavelet transformation. This structure facilitates the understanding of statistical differences along the control-flow and performance dimensions. The approach has been evaluated using real-life event logs against two baselines. The results show that at a trace level, the baselines cannot always reveal the differences discovered by our approach, or can detect spurious differences.","Taymouri, Farbod; La Rosa, Marcello; Carmona, Josep",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,579,4

Nuciferine is an active component derived from folium nelumbinis and has been demonstrated to have beneficial effects on a high-fat diet (HFD) induced hepatic steatosis model. However, the effect of the altered metabolites of nuciferine on NAFLD has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we established a NAFLD rat model using HFD and treated with nuciferine. The lipid content levels, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress were investigated to access the therapeutic effects of nuciferine. Additionally, the metabolic regulatory mechanisms of nuciferine on NAFLD were analyzed using untargeted metabolomics. Gene expression of the key enzymes related to the changed metabolic pathways following nuciferine intervention was also investigated. The results showed that nuciferine treatment significantly reduced the body weight, levels of lipids, and liver enzymes in the blood and improved the hepatic steatosis in the NAFLD rat model. Nuciferine treatment also increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and decreased the levels of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) in the liver. Nuciferine treatment decreased the serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and upregulated the gene expression of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in the liver. Metabolomic analysis indicated a metabolism disorder in the NAFLD rat model reflected in a dysfunction of the glycerophospholipid, linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, arginine and proline metabolism. Conversely, treatment with nuciferine improved the metabolic disorder in the NAFLD rat model. Nuciferine treatment also regulated the gene expression of key enzymes related to the glycerophospholipid, linoleic acid, and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism pathways in the liver. In conclusion, our study demonstrated an amelioration of the metabolic disorders following nuciferine treatment in NAFLD rat model.

Burnout is associated with many deleterious consequences affecting health care outcomes. The present study is intended to determine the dimensions of burnout in nurses on surgical, medical and critical care units and its relationship with demographic characteristics. METHODS: In this descriptive research study, performed at critical and non- critical care units, 743 nurses were randomly selected by quota sampling from medical sciences universities in Iran. Data collection instruments included a “demographic questionnaire” and the “Persian version of the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. Data were analyzed using SPSS20. RESULTS: The findings showed that regarding all dimensions, the lowest level of burnout belonged to surgical wards whereas the highest level pertained to critical care wards indicating a significant difference among various aspects of burnout in different wards, i.e., surgery, medical, and critical care. There was no significant difference in gender, academic degree, and marital status in any of the aspects of burnout in critical care units; yet, the difference was significant between surgical and medical wards (P < 0.05). There were a negative significant correlation between some dimensions of burnout with age and nursing experience in critical care and medical wards (P < 0.05). Whereas in surgical wards, there were a positive significant correlation between some aspects of burnout with nursing experience and age (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study found that the critical care nurses have significantly higher level of burnout compared to the medical-surgical nurses. These results should be considered when planning burnout prevention schedules for nurses.","Mahmoudi, Sara; Barkhordari-Sharifabad, Maasoumeh; Pishgooie, Amir-Hosein; Atashzadeh-Shoorideh, Foroozan; Lotfi, Zahra",BMC Nurs,579,16

To our knowledge, it is the first study in Turkey to value human life losses associated with COVID-19. Methods: A human capital approach (HCA) model was applied to estimate the total monetary value of the 4,807 human lives lost in Turkey (TMVHL) from COVID-19 by 15 June 2020. The TMVHL equals the sum of monetary values of human lives lost (MVHL) across nine age groups. The MVHL accruing to each age group is the sum of the product of discount factor, years of life lost, net GDP per capita, and the number of COVID-19 deaths in an age group. The HCA model was re-calculated five times assuming discount rates of 3%, 5%, and 10% with a national life expectancy of 78.45 years; and the world highest life expectancy of 87.1 years and global life expectancy of 72 years with 3% discount rate. Results: The 4807 human life losses from COVID-19 had a TMVHL of Int$1,098,469,122; and a mean of Int$228,514 per human life. Reanalysis with 5% and 10% discount rates, holding national life expectancy constant, reduced the TMVHL by Int$167,248,319 (15.2%) and Int$ 429,887,379 (39%), respectively. Application of the global life expectancy reduced the TMVHL by 36.4%, and use of world highest life expectancy increased TMVHL by 69%. However, the HCA captures only the economic production losses incurred as a result of years of life lost. It ignores non-market contributions to social welfare and the adverse effects of economic activities.

With the Trump Administration, the situation has changed dramatically as President Trump is supportive of neither multilateralism in general nor of the EU, which is weakened through BREXIT, in particular. Trump’s focus on the US merchandise trade balance deficit is ill-placed and import tariffs imposed on China seem to be excessive as the optimum tariff rate is miscalculated on the basis of the traditional formula – while a new adequate formula would include the role of sectoral US outward FDI stocks.

At the same time, the prospects for EU cooperation are declining due to political disappointment concerning the national corona pandemic policy in some member countries. An effective anti-corona pandemic policy would mean to organize a consistent EU-ASEAN cooperation or a G20 cooperation with a later extension to UN Organizations, including the IMF, the World Bank and the WHO.

The four semi-cokes were obtained under the pyrolysis temperature of 400, 500, 600 and 700 °C, named as SM-400, SM-500, SM-600 and SM-700, respectively. The analyses of nitrogen adsorption, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra and Raman spectra were carried out to explain the change in combustion ratio and grindability. The result showed that the specific surface area of samples had an essential effect on the combustion ratio of SM-400 and SM-500. Meanwhile, the grindability depended on the strength of coal matrix, and the augment of pore amounts would increase the grindability. The functional groups and graphitization degree of the same sample were identical with the combustion ratio. With the pyrolysis upgrading temperature increasing, the combustion ratio of sample decreased, corresponding to the decrease in the benzene ring and the increase in graphitization degree. In addition, the thermogravimetric analysis was carried out, and the result was compared against what was shown in the data of combustion ratio. For pulverized coal injection, the combustion ratio was more intuitive and more accurate than combustibility.","Huang, Chun-chao; Ning, Xiao-jun; Wang, Guang-wei; Zhang, Jian-liang; Peng, Zheng-fu; Teng, Hai-peng",J,579,16

Moreover, there is no sign of a sustained decline in any country till date. Continuous rise of positive cases has instilled fear in people, society and even health professionals. According to WHO’s daily situation report, 22,073 COVID-19 cases of healthcare professionals have been reported to the WHO as of Wednesday, 8 April 2020 by Jin (Mil Med Res 7:24, 2020). Infection to health professionals is a serious concern not only because they are a valuable frontline worker but also because of the risk of spread to co-workers and non-Covid patients. This project was undertaken to develop a solution to minimize the chance of infection to the health care professionals by providing them isolation from a potential source of Covid-19 and similar highly contagious diseases. The two models of Chitra swab collection booth were developed to: (1) protect health professionals from the risk of infection (2) to provide technical know-how to manufacturers to produce booths using locally available materials while meeting international regulations and (3) reduce the consumption of personal protective equipment. The prototypes developed were tested for safety and efficacy in accordance with the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA. The device received the registration for commercialisation from the Central Drugs Control Standard Organization, Ministry of Health, Government of India, as a non-notified medical device.","Nair, Saurabh Sudhakaran; Prajapati, Arvind Kumar; Venkatesan, Ramesh Babu; Vayalappil, Muraleedharan Chirathodi; Kishore, Asha",Trans Indian Natl,579,22

From the medical point of view, the data might be useful to clinicians and vaccinologists to develop and evaluate immunomodulatory and immunotherapeutic approaches. As a matter of fact, primates seem to be unreliable animal models for revealing potential autoimmune events in preclinical testing of immunotherapies. In terms of genomics, the scarce or absent peptide sharing between pathogens and primates versus the massive peptide sharing existing between pathogens and humans lets foresee mechanisms of pathogen sequence insertion/deletion/alteration that have differently operated in mammals over evolutionary timescales. Why and how the human genome has been colonized by pathogen sequences and why and how primates escaped such a colonization appears to be the new scientific challenge in our efforts to understand not only the origin of Homo sapiens but also his autoimmune diseasome.","Kanduc, Darja; Shoenfeld, Yehuda",Glob Med Genet,579,6

Feminist scholars have theorized these interlocking systems of domination as the “continuum of violence.” Building on this scholarship, we conceptualize the U.S. response to and the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic as reflective of the continuum of violence. We argue that crises like pandemics expose the antidemocratic and exclusionary practices inherent in this continuum, which is especially racialized and gendered. To support our argument, we provide empirical evidence of the continuum of violence in relation to COVID-19 vis-à-vis the interrelated issues of militarization and what feminists call “everyday security,” such as public health and gender-based violence. The continuum of violence contributes theoretically and practically to our understanding of how violence that the pandemic illuminates is embedded in broader systems of domination and exclusion.","Forester, Summer; O'Brien, Cheryl",,579,3

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The main chemical components of QHD were searched using traditional Chinese medicine system pharmacology technology platform (TCMSP) and PubChem database. The main chemical components of the prescription were ADMET screened by the ACD/Labs software. The main active ingredient was screened by 60% oral bioavailability, and 60% of “bad” ingredients were removed from the drug-like group. Swiss Target Prediction, the SEA, and HitPick systems were sequentially used to search for the target of each active ingredient, and a network map of the QHD's target of the active ingredient was constructed. Genome annotation database platforms (GeneCards, OMIM, and DisGeNET) were used to predict action targets related to fatty liver disease. “Drug-Disease-Target” network diagram could be visualized with the help of Cytoscape (3.7.1) software. UniProt and STRING database platforms were used to build a protein interaction network. The KEGG signal pathway and DAVID platform were analyzed for biological process enrichment. RESULTS: A total of 128 active ingredients and 275 corresponding targets in QHD were discovered through screening. 55 key target targets and 27 important signaling pathways were screened, such as the cancer pathway, P13K-AKT signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, and other related signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed the material basis of QHD and discussed the pharmacological mechanism of QHD in fatty liver, thus providing a scientific basis for the clinical application and experimental research of QHD in the future.","Gao, Shan-shan; Sun, Ji-jia; Wang, Xin; Hu, Yi-yang; Feng, Qin; Gou, Xiao-jun",Biomed Res Int,579,33

Little is known, however, about potential risk and protective factors linked to loneliness during the pandemic. In the present study, we examined factors associated with loneliness in a U.S. sample of adults aged 50 and older with at least one chronic condition. Participants included 701 adults aged 50 to 94 (M = 64.57 years, SD = 8.84) who were recruited over 8 consecutive weeks between May 14 and July 9, 2020 to complete an anonymous online survey. We estimated a series of multiple linear regressions to determine how sociodemographic characteristics, health characteristics, stress related to COVID-19, and social resources were independently associated with loneliness during the pandemic. Two-thirds of participants reported moderate to severe loneliness. The fully adjusted regression model showed that being a person of color, having a spouse or cohabiting partner, and reporting more emotional support were linked to lower levels of loneliness. Higher anxiety symptoms, more worry about being infected with COVID-19, and greater perceived financial strain because of COVID-19 were associated with higher levels of loneliness. These findings pinpoint potential targets for interventions to improve and maintain the well-being of a particularly vulnerable subgroup of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and in future public health crises.","Polenick, Courtney; Perbix, Emily; Salwi, Shreya; Maust, Donovan; Birditt, Kira; Brooks, Jessica",Innov Aging,579,10

A 22-item survey was administered to 229 volunteers who previously worked with children through the Oasis Intergenerational Tutoring program in St. Louis. Questions focused on technology use patterns and attitudes toward virtual volunteering. Most respondents have used a computer, a smartphone, and the Internet before at home (90.3%), but 22.8% of respondents feel uncomfortable or very uncomfortable when using the Internet. Video conferencing software such as Zoom or Skype was not used before by 14.0% of the respondents, the top reasons being because they prefer other forms of communication (48.4%) or find it too difficult to keep up with technology (19.4%). If tutoring becomes virtual-only, 60.6% of the participants responded they were somewhat likely or very likely to participate, with significant variation by school districts (X2 = 21.92, p < .05, Cramer’s V = 0.33) ranging from 42.6% to 96.0% (Bonferroni post hoc p < .05). Tutors from school districts that were less likely to tutor virtually had lower levels of education and higher levels of discomfort when using the Internet. The respondents also voiced that while virtual tutoring may eliminate barriers to in-person tutoring, such as commuting to schools and inclement weather, they were concerned about establishing a personal connection with their students online. These findings suggest that tutors anticipate both benefits and challenges with virtual volunteering and efforts to engage older adults virtually should factor in prior use of technology and variations by geography.","Sun, Peter; Morrow-Howell, Nancy; Pawloski, Elizabeth; Swinford, Emma",Innov Aging,579,16

The situation is compounded by the loss of depth information during perspective projection. We present Center3D, a one-stage anchor-free approach and an extension of CenterNet, to efficiently estimate 3D location and depth using only monocular RGB images. By exploiting the difference between 2D and 3D centers, we are able to estimate depth consistently. Center3D uses a combination of classification and regression to understand the hidden depth information more robustly than each method alone. Our method employs two joint approaches: (1) LID: a classification-dominated approach with sequential Linear Increasing Discretization. (2) DepJoint: a regression-dominated approach with multiple Eigen’s transformations [6] for depth estimation. Evaluating on KITTI dataset [8] for moderate objects, Center3D improved the AP in BEV from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] , and the AP in 3D from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] .

Some of them are related to the unavailability of radiology specialists, the increasingly overwhelming number of Chest X-Ray images generated daily, or the respiratory disease by itself. Consequently, it might lead to radiologist burnout. Furthermore, an unusual location of pathological lung signs may lead to a misdiagnosis of severe pulmonary disease. Several pathological signs are observed from a Chest X-Ray and on different tissues: Heart and Pericardium, Hili, Mediastinum, Lungs, Pleura, and Chest wall. In the present study, a Deep Learning model is presented, which identifies several tissues and abnormal signs that may require a deeper evaluation.

The model reached 97% of accuracy. These results suggest that our model can be used as an automatic identifier of tissues and pathological signs from Chest X-Ray images. In consequence, it constitutes a meaningful and essential tool for preliminary studies of the severe respiratory disease since it can potentially decrease the number of false positives in the most common radiological examination ordered for patient evaluation. It also could be used for screening purposes to detect findings that may be useful in any pathology assessment, and in the decision-making process of conducting further image modality evaluations, such as CT.","Carnier, Martin; Albertti, Raul; Gavidia, Liliana; Severeyn, Erika; La Cruz, Alexandra","Artificial Intelligence, Computer and Software Engineering Advances",579,5

Even though everyone is at risk of infections regardless of ethnicity, income, age, and political affiliation, the consequences of the epidemic will weigh enormously in the global south, at the level of the very fragile sanitary architecture, the economic, social and cultural fabric. This study examines the key determinants of social media adoption and the consequences of their use in managing a public health crisis of International Concern like COVID-19. We propose a theoretical framework resulting from a combination of several approaches, such as the Health Belief Model, the Technology Acceptance Model and the theory of Social Influence. Moreover, we use a mixed research method to carry out various investigations in our study. The findings and recommendations of this research will serve as a research base for government agencies, health organizations and associations in the reflections and strategic actions being implemented to effectively fight against COVID-19 and equip marginalized communities with efficient information through the use of social media.","Kuika Watat, Josue; Moukoko Mbonjo, Magaly",Re-imagining Diffusion and Adoption of Information Technology and Systems: A Continuing Conversation,579,1

Most of the offices and academic institutions started operating, on ‘work-from-home’ mode, on digital platform. Even senior citizens, non-working homemakers and kids spent more time in social (networking and communication) media. The ‘difficult times’ of COVID—pandemic has also shown the world the ‘different times’ and the difference in our preferred way of functioning. The ‘digital consumption pattern’ changed substantially, both by its scale and by diversity. The present paper discusses the issue of ‘effectiveness and impact’ of ‘digital medium’ on ‘digital life’ of its users (/digital consumers), particularly during this extended lockdown. The objective is to discuss issues relating to the ‘effect of extended/longer use of net, during this pandemic, for academic and professional activities from home, continuously’. The study is about the life in virtual world, particularly during this extended lockdown. The paper adopts a method of descriptive statistical analysis, covering different categories of users of Eastern India. Using a structured questionnaire method, descriptive primary data, relating to digital consumption, were collected from around 1350 respondents, from Odisha and its neighbouring states. Result shows how different categories prefer and use their preferred social media. Study finds a significant contribution of Internet-based social media (SM), countering ‘social isolation’ of senior citizens.","Subudhi, Rabi N.",Trends of Data Science and Applications,579,1

First, renewable energy is introduced from the circular economy perspective, to better understand its significance in promoting sustainability. Solar energy among all renewable energy sources is the most promising for resource-stressed tropical cities such as Singapore. For such densely populated built-environments, innovative energy systems such as the building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems serve as good options to capture and use renewable energy incident on large facade areas. To estimate the financial feasibility of implementing BIPV systems and the cost-competitiveness in comparison with conventional building materials, the LCC serves as an enabling tool to evaluate the viability of these energy systems as per the market need. A step-by-step illustration of the LCC analysis, based on the tool developed by the BIPV Centre of Excellence at the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), is provided as a case study. This highlights the significance of LCC in evaluating the economic benefits of a practical application of a BIPV system for a representative high-rise building in Singapore. The benefits of transiting toward such sustainable and clean energy systems from a consumer and environmental perspective are summarized as the conclusion of the chapter.","Patil, Rashmi Anoop; Shabunko, Veronika; Ramakrishna, Seeram",An Introduction to Circular Economy,579,1

The structural identities of the azo-chromene 4a-l were confirmed on the basis of their spectral data and elemental analysis, and a UV–visible study was performed in a Dimethylformamide (DMF) solution for these molecules. Additionally, the antimicrobial activity was investigated against four human pathogens (Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria) and four fungi, employing an agar well diffusion method, with their minimum inhibitory concentrations being reported. Molecules 4a, 4g, and 4h were discovered to be more efficacious against Syncephalastrum racemosum (RCMB 05922) in comparison to the reference drugs, while compounds 4b and 4h demonstrated the highest inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) in evaluation against the reference drugs. Moreover, their cytotoxicity was assessed against three different human cell lines, including human colon carcinoma (HCT-116), human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2), and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) with a selection of molecules illustrating potency against the HCT-116 and MCF-7 cell lines. Furthermore, the molecular modeling results depicted the binding interactions of the synthesized compounds 3b and 3h in the active site of the E. coli DNA gyrase B enzyme with a clear SAR (structure–activity relationship) analysis. Lastly, the density functional theory’s (DFTs) theoretical calculations were performed to quantify the energy levels of the Frontier Molecular Orbitals (FMOs) and their energy gaps, dipole moments, and molecular electrostatic potentials.

Ephrin-B2 and -B3 are entry receptors for Hendra and Nipah viruses, but Cedar virus can utilize human ephrin-B1, -B2, -A2 and -A5 and mouse ephrin-A1. However, the entry receptor for MojV remains unknown, and its species tropism is not well characterized. Here, we utilized recombinant full-length and soluble forms of the MojV fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins in membrane fusion and receptor tropism studies. MojV F and G were functionally competent and mediated cell–cell fusion in primate and rattine cells, albeit with low levels and slow fusion kinetics. Although a relative instability of the pre-fusion conformation of a soluble form of MojV F was observed, MojV F displayed significantly greater fusion activity when heterotypically paired with Ghana virus G. An exhaustive investigation of A- and B-class ephrins indicated that none serve as a primary receptor for MojV. The MojV cell fusion phenotype is therefore likely the result of receptor restriction rather than functional defects in recombinant MojV F and G glycoproteins.","Cheliout Da Silva, Sofia; Yan, Lianying; Dang, Ha V.; Xu, Kai; Epstein, Jonathan H.; Veesler, David; Broder, Christopher C.",Viruses,579,26

Convenience store companies have also earned such recognition through their responses to natural disasters. This is, however, somewhat paradoxical, since their just-in-time business model is in principle highly vulnerable to such events. This article introduces the case of the Japanese convenience store to demonstrate how responding to grand societal challenges can—beyond demonstrating corporate social responsibility or striving for legitimacy—become an essential part of corporate business models. It argues that such an approach creates the need for higher-level capabilities and increases the number of involved stakeholders, and concludes that this might throw previously successful business models off balance.","Meyer-Ohle, Hendrik",Asian Bus Manage,579,32

RCS released guidance on altering surgical practise during the pandemic to deliver safe surgical care in March, 2020. We present an audit conducted at a DGH comparing practice of emergency general surgery (EGS) with RCS guidance at the peak of COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Consecutive patients undergoing EGS from 1(st) April to 15(th) May,2020. Data of demographics, ASA grade, comorbidities, type of surgery, hospital stay, informed COVID-19 pneumonia consent, complications and 30-day mortality were collected. Pre- and post-operative COVID-19 status was determined. RESULTS: Forty-four (n = 44) patients, mean age 47.5 and IQR (26-69). Male (55.8%) and females (44.2%). Preoperative COVID19 status was confirmed in around 79.1% patients. All (100%) patients who underwent CT imaging preoperatively had CT chest performed. Informed consent for COVID19 pneumonia was taken in 4.7% patients. 30-day mortality risk was 7% and complications risk was 4.7%. RR of 30-day mortality in preoperative COVID19 status positive patients was RR = 0.92 (CI 0.85-1.01) and for complications was RR = 0.95 (CI 0.88-1.02).

For these reason there was a reorganization of inflammatory bowel disease follow-up visit shifting from traditional visit to telemedicine whereas it’ was possible. Our survey aimed to evaluated satisfaction about follow up video-consulting in IBD patients. METHODS: From September to December 2020, 75 video-consults were made as follow up in patients with IBD. Video-consult wasn’t performed as first visit nor in patients with new clinical issue. Every consult lasted about 15 minutes. At the end of the visit, a questionnaire of satisfaction was e-mailed to each patient. This questionnaire evaluated several items: satisfaction, difficulty of connection, opportunity to repeat the video-consult even in post-Covid-19 era, safety compared to face-to-face visit, level of concern about Covid-19 disease and fear of in-hospital transmission RESULTS: 70% of the patients indicated an high video-consult rating and in most of cases (88%) there were no connection problems. The majority (88%) would like to repeat the tele-visit even in the post-Covid 19 era (77%). Video-consult seemed to be perceived as safer than face-to-face visit even if, in case of urgent consultation, it was preferred a traditional visit. Moreover, Covid-19 infection and fear of in-hospital trasmission was a great concern in the 73% and 58% of the patients respectively.

Anecdotally, many patients ‐ even those who experience only mild cases initially ‐ continue to suffer from symptoms months after diagnosis, including indicators of potential autonomic dysfunction like tachycardia upon standing. However, the long‐term impact of and recovery from COVID‐19 on autonomic and cardiovascular function in otherwise healthy individuals remains largely unclear. METHODS: Otherwise healthy young adults (n=11, 6F) who had tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 came to the laboratory two times: Visit 1 (V1) was 3‐4 weeks post‐diagnosis, and Visit 2 (V2) was one month later. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA; n=2) via microneurography, beat by beat systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) arterial blood pressure via finger photoplethysmography, and heart rate (HR) were continuously measured in subjects at rest, during a 2‐min cold pressor test (CPT), and during 5 min each at 30° and 60° head up tilt (HUT; no MSNA). Paired sample t‐tests and two‐way ANOVA were used to determine differences in the cardiovascular outcome measures between visits. RESULTS: Resting SBP (123 ± 18 vs. 119 ± 17 mmHg), DBP (73 ± 16 vs. 69 ± 7 mmHg), and HR (63 ± 10 vs. 62 ± 9 bpm) did not change from V1 to V2. Preliminary data (n=2) indicates MSNA may decrease from V1 to V2 (14.5 ± 4 vs. 9 ± 3 bursts·min‐1), but the study is currently not powered to examine statistical significance. During the 2‐minute CPT protocol, SBP (150 ± 10 vs. 145 ± 13 mmHg, p=0.08), DBP (94 ± 12 vs. 88 ± 12 mmHg, p=0.10), and HR (77 ± 19 vs. 71 ± 11 bpm, p=0.11) tended to be the same or lower from V1 to V2. Likewise, individual data from two subjects suggests MSNA reactivity during a painful stimulus (CPT) may decrease from V1 to V2 (16 ± 4 vs 10 ± 3 bursts·min‐1). These two subjects also exhibited reduced MSNA during the three‐minute CPT recovery period from V1 to V2 (14 ± 2 vs. 7 ± 1 bursts·min‐1). During both 30° and 60° HUT, SBP, DBP, and HR responses were similar between V1 and V2. CONCLUSION: Young, otherwise healthy individuals infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 may have exaggerated sympathetic neural and cardiovascular responses to physiological stress 3‐4 weeks post‐positive test date. However, preliminary data indicates that sympathetic and cardiovascular reactivity to painful stimuli is reduced from one‐ to two‐months post‐diagnosis. Continued monitoring of autonomic and cardiovascular function is warranted to determine the long‐term consequences of contracting SARS‐CoV‐2.","Stute, Nina; Province, Valesha; Augenreich, Marc; Stickford, Jonathon; Ratchford, Stephen; Stickford, Abigail",FASEB J,579,15

The COVID19 pandemic has not only disrupted the health system of the entire world but has also put tremendous pressure on it. According to the CDC, mucormycosis (previously called zygomycosis) is a serious but rare fungal infection caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes. These molds live throughout the environment. Mucormycosis mainly affects people who have health problems or take medicines that lower the body's ability to fight germs and sickness. It is an aggressive fulminant invasive fungal infection that can occur in patients with diverse precipitating factors such as uncontrolled diabetes, renal failure, organ transplant, long‐term corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy, cirrhosis, burns, Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome and malignancies such as lymphomas and leukemias. Reportings of mucormycosis in covid patients have posed an additional apprehension and an onus on the already struggling government and health care workers. OBJECTIVE: Description of case series of mucormycosis in post COVID19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Systematic review of various studies reporting presence of mucormycosis in post covid patients was done. The study was conducted to assess the impact of mucormycosis on patients suffering from a virus. While searching keywords “covid” and “mucormycosis” on Google Scholar and internet, we found 9 studies which reported 13 post covid patients infected with mucormycosis. RESULT: Mucormycosis can be divided into at least six clinical syndromes: rhino‐orbital‐cerebral, pulmonary, cutaneous, gastrointestinal, disseminated, and miscellaneous. Analysis of post covid patients showed four clinical manifestations‐ Rhino‐Orbital‐Cerebral Disease (3 research papers reporting one case each and 1 research paper with 4 patients); Pulmonary Disease (3 research papers with 4 cases); Gastrointestinal Disease (1 research paper with 1 case) and Disseminated (1 research paper with 1 case). Out of these total thirteen patients, seven were reported dead. [Table: see text] CONCLUSION: As per Worldometer approximately 88 million cases of COVID19 have been reported so far of which nearly 1.9 million succumbed to death. Although the reported data relating to presence of mucormycosis in Covid patients is very meagre, yet the fatality rate is more than fifty percent. The situation is alarming. Exhaustive studies need to be undertaken as delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment may lead to higher risk of negative outcomes.","Agarwal, Abhimanyu; Puri, Inder",FASEB J,579,16

The UK government reacted to this with a three‐pronged approach of importing, up‐scaling existing production and supporting new design projects. The latter two parts – labelled the UK Ventilator Challenge – included over 50 companies from various sectors including the automotive and aerospace industries. Nine multi‐partner consortia and five single‐company projects were initiated with varying approaches. This study explores lessons learned during the setup and management of these medical device designs and manufacturing consortia. A qualitative survey methodology was employed, and 32 semi‐structured stakeholder interviews were conducted. The primary data was triangulated through the collection of 42 secondary data sources such as webinars and radio interviews. Transcription and a three‐step data analysis process of thematic coding identified six lessons learned. The analysis of the data showed that a strong, appealing common goal can enable employee motivation and trust as well as align priorities across all companies involved. This facilitates the involvement and fruitful collaboration of companies with varying sizes and fields of expertise. Furthermore, selecting the most suitable employees with specialist knowledge for high‐priority projects and empowering them to make decisions can have a positive effect on project performance. The findings from the study complement existing literature on new product development and crisis management processes. In addition, the results uncover potential long‐term effects such as more openness for cross‐sector collaborations, which can serve as interesting sources for further research.","von Behr, Carl‐Magnus; Semple, Georgia Anne; Minshall, Tim",,579,24

COVID‐19 continues to cause widespread economic and social turmoil, and while the current focus is on both minimising the spread of the disease and deploying a range of vaccines to save lives, attention will soon turn to future proofing. In line with this, this paper proposes a prediction and containment model that could be used for pandemics and natural disasters. It combines selective lockdowns and protective cordons to rapidly contain the hazard while allowing minimally impacted local communities to conduct “business as usual” and/or offer support to highly impacted areas. A flexible, easy to use data analytics model, based on Self Organising Maps, is developed to facilitate easy decision making by governments and organisations. Comparative tests using publicly available data for Great Britain (GB) show that through the use of the proposed prediction and containment strategy, it is possible to reduce the peak infection rate, while keeping several regions (up to 25% of GB parliamentary constituencies) economically active within protective cordons.","Moodley, Raymond; Chiclana, Francisco; Caraffini, Fabio; Gongora, Mario",,579,22

The prepared set constitutes five analogues that differ from each other by the terminally attached compact polar group. Characterization of the synthesized derivatives is conducted using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized optical microscopy (POM), and UV-spectroscopy. Molecular structures were elucidated by elemental analyses, FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy. DSC and POM investigations indicated that all the prepared derivatives are monomorphic possessing the nematic (N) phase, except for the unsubstituted derivative that is nonmesomorphic. On the other side, the photophysical study and the optical spectra measurements confirm the photoactivity of the present compounds under UV/visible irradiation. The measured optical spectra showed impressive enhancement in the optical absorption and reduction in the optical bandgap from 3.63 to 3.0 eV depending on the terminal group. From the study of the DC electric properties, the lowest resistance, 106.5 GΩ at scan rate 0.1 V/s, was observed for the I6(d) film with Cl terminal, which decreased to 49.5 GΩ by increasing the scan rate to 0.5 V/s. Moreover, the electrical conductance is decreased from 9.39 pS to 1.35 pS at scan rate 0.1 V/s by changing the terminal group from Cl to F. The enhanced optical absorption and the reduced energy gap make the optimized samples suitable material for solar energy applications.","Gomha, Sobhi M.; Ahmed, Hoda A.; Shaban, Mohamed; Abolibda, Tariq Z.; Khushaim, Muna S.; Alharbi, Khalid A.",Materials (Basel),579,16

Along with the R-MHI-5, other instruments were applied to measure anxiety and depression. Regarding the results, it was evidenced that the model with two related factors presents better fit indices (CFI = .99; TLI = .99; RMSEA = .071) compared to a one-dimensional model (CFI = .74; TLI = .48; RMSEA = .422). Also, it was found that the factorial structure of the MHI-5 did not show evidence of being strictly invariant for the group of men and women. However, it did show evidence of partial invariance for the group of adolescents and adults. Furthermore, the latent relationships model showed that psychological well-being is negatively related to anxiety (− .25) and depression (− .37), and psychological distress is positively related to anxiety (.85) and depression (.87). From the IRT perspective, all items present adequate discrimination indices, with item 4 being the most accurate item to assess psychological well-being. Regarding psychological distress, items 3 and 5 are the most accurate to assess this dimension. It is concluded that the scale that the R-MHI-5 is an instrument with robust psychometric evidence from the perspective of CTT and IRT.","Vilca, Lindsey W.; Chávez, Blanca V.; Fernández, Yoselin Shara; Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás",Trends in Psychol.,579,16

Methods: Six hundred and seven older adults (Sample 1) and 156 older adults (Sample 2) participated in the study during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. The older adults completed a battery of validated instruments for anxiety, stress, concern of COVID-19 infection (outcome variables), satisfaction with health, perceived danger of COVID-19, loneliness, intolerance of uncertainty (IU), optimism, powerlessness, and coping self-efficacy (predictor variables). The data were analyzed using multiple linear regression. Results: The older adults in both samples experienced moderate levels of anxiety, stress, and concern of COVID-19 infection. The greatest amount of variability in anxiety and stress was explained by powerlessness, IU, optimism, and coping self-efficacy. Concern of COVID-19 infection was best predicted by the perceived danger of COVID-19. Conclusion: The findings contribute to the existing knowledge about the mental health of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the role of the psychological predictors of anxiety, stress, and concern of COVID-19 infection during both waves.","Köverová, Miroslava; Ráczová, Beáta; Kováčová Holevová, Bibiána",Gerontol Geriatr Med,579,16

In the diagnosis of L. monocytogenes meningoencephalitis (LMM), the traditional test often reports negative owing to the antibiotic treatment or a low number of bacteria in the cerebrospinal fluid. To date, timely diagnosis and accurate treatment remains a challenge for patients with listeria infections. CASE PRESENTATION We present the case of a 66-year-old woman whose clinical manifestations were suspected as tuberculous meningoencephalitis, but the case was finally properly diagnosed as LMM by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The patient was successfully treated using a combined antibacterial therapy, comprising ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSION To improve the sensitivity of LMM diagnosis, we used NGS for the detection of L. monocytogenes. Hence, the clinical utility of this approach can be very helpful since it provides quickly and trust results.","Lan, Zi-Wei; Xiao, Min-Jia; Guan, Yuan-Lin; Zhan, Ya-Jing; Tang, Xiang-Qi",BMC infectious diseases,579,1

Based on previous widespread disasters, future high prevalence of short- and long-term adverse mental health consequences are anticipated. Studies of COVID-19 outside the United States indicated moderately high levels of distress, but we have little information regarding Americans' distress nor the factors associated with relative distress or adjustment during this unprecedented time. This study represents the first national view of Americans' distress during the massive disruption of COVID-19 and identifies levels of stress exposure, protective psychosocial resources, and coping strategies. METHOD Data were collected April 7-9, 2020 from an online platform, using best practices for ensuring high-quality data; 1,015 completed respondents are included ([53.9%] women; average age = 38.9 years; mostly White [82.4%] and non-Hispanic [91.5%]). Respondents' locations ranged across the United States, from 18.5% in the Northeast to 37.8% in the South. RESULTS Fairly high levels of stress exposure and peritraumatic and general distress (depression, anxiety, and stress) were reported. Emotion regulation skills along with active and distraction coping emerged as the strongest predictors of lower distress levels. CONCLUSIONS These results identify potential targets for online mental health interventions-focusing on engaging in adaptive emotion regulation and coping (e.g., through telehealth mental health first aid)-during the pandemic to offset the likely rise in distress over the months ahead.

The tissue niche imprints macrophage identity, phenotype and function. The role of vascular endothelial signals in tailoring the phenotype and function of tissue macrophages remains unknown. The lung is a highly vascularized organ and replete with a large population of resident macrophages. We found that, in response to inflammatory injury, lung endothelial cells release the Wnt signaling modulator Rspondin3, which activates β-catenin signaling in lung interstitial macrophages and increases mitochondrial respiration by glutaminolysis. The generated tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate, in turn, serves as the cofactor for the epigenetic regulator TET2 to catalyze DNA hydroxymethylation. Notably, endothelial-specific deletion of Rspondin3 prevented the formation of anti-inflammatory interstitial macrophages in endotoxemic mice and induced unchecked severe inflammatory injury. Thus, the angiocrine-metabolic-epigenetic signaling axis specified by the endothelium is essential for reprogramming interstitial macrophages and dampening inflammatory injury.","Zhou, Bisheng; Magana, Lissette; Hong, Zhigang; Huang, Long Shuang; Chakraborty, Sreeparna; Tsukasaki, Yoshikazu; Huang, Cary; Wang, Li; Di, Anke; Ganesh, Balaji; Gao, Xiaopei; Rehman, Jalees; Malik, Asrar B",Nature immunology,579,24

We hypothesized that patients with primary graft dysfunction (PGD) after lung transplantation would have higher RAGE levels in plasma than patients without PGD. OBJECTIVES To test the association of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) levels with PGD in a prospective, multicenter cohort study. METHODS We measured plasma levels of sRAGE at 6 and 24 hours after allograft reperfusion in 317 lung transplant recipients at seven centers. The primary outcome was grade 3 PGD (Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)) < 200 with alveolar infiltrates) within the first 72 hours after transplantation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patients who developed PGD had higher levels of sRAGE than patients without PGD at both 6 hours (median 9.3 ng/ml vs. 7.5 ng/ml, respectively; P = 0.028) and at 24 hours post-transplantation (median 4.3 ng/ml vs. 1.9 ng/ml, respectively; P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that the relationship between levels of sRAGE and PGD was attenuated by elevated right heart pressures and by the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Median sRAGE levels were higher in subjects with cardiopulmonary bypass at both 6 hours (P = 0.003) and 24 hours (P < 0.001). sRAGE levels at 6 hours were significantly associated with intraoperative red cell transfusion (Spearman's rho = 0.39, P = 0.002 in those with PGD), and in multivariable linear regression analyses this association was independent of confounding variables (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Elevated plasma levels of sRAGE are associated with PGD after lung transplantation. Furthermore, plasma sRAGE levels are associated with blood product transfusion and use of cardiopulmonary bypass.","Christie, Jason D; Shah, Chirag V; Kawut, Steven M; Mangalmurti, Nilam; Lederer, David J; Sonett, Joshua R; Ahya, Vivek N; Palmer, Scott M; Wille, Keith; Lama, Vibha; Shah, Pali D; Shah, Ashish; Weinacker, Ann; Deutschman, Clifford S; Kohl, Benjamin A; Demissie, Ejigayehu; Bellamy, Scarlett; Ware, Lorraine B",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,579,9

Vertebral canal endoscopy has been used in man to localise spinal cord lesions and has the potential to become a useful diagnostic technique in horses. OBJECTIVE To establish a surgical approach via the atlanto-occipital space to the cervical vertebral canal in equine cadavers and describe the endoscopic anatomy of the cervical epidural and subarachnoid spaces. METHODS The cadavers of 25 mature horses were used to assess 3 surgical methods to approach the cervical vertebral canal, including 2 minimally invasive and one open technique. Once the approach had been made, a flexible videoendoscope was inserted into the epidural space (epiduroscopy) or the subarachnoid space (myeloscopy) and advanced caudally until the intervertebral space between C7 and T1 was reached. RESULTS The epidural and subarachnoid spaces could not be accessed reliably using the minimally invasive techniques. Furthermore, damage to the nervous tissues was a frequent complication with these procedures. The open approach allowed successful insertion of the videoendoscope into the epidural and subarachnoid spaces in all horses and no inadvertent damage was observed. Anatomical structures that could be seen in the epidural space included the dura mater, nerve roots, fat and the ventral internal vertebral venous plexus. In the subarachnoid space, the spinal cord, nerve roots, blood vessels, denticulate ligaments and external branch of the accessory nerve were seen. CONCLUSIONS Using the open approach, epiduroscopy and myeloscopy over the entire length of the cervical vertebral canal are possible in the mature horse. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE Cervical vertebral canal endoscopy may become a valuable tool to localise the site of spinal cord injury in horses with cervical vertebral stenotic myelopathy and could aid in the diagnosis of other diseases of the cervical spinal cord.","Prange, T; Derksen, F J; Stick, J A; Garcia-Pereira, F L",Equine veterinary journal,579,1

In contrast to many other viruses in birds of the family Turdidae or viruses of the family Picornaviridae, TV1, TV2 and TV3 were found exclusively in the autumn and winter months. Two genomes each of TV1, TV2 and TV3 were sequenced. Regions P1, P2 and P3 of the three turdiviruses possessed, respectively, <40, <40 and <50 % amino acid identities with those of other picornaviruses. Moreover, P1, P2 and P3 of TV1 also possessed, respectively, <40, <40 and <50 % amino acid identities with those of TV2 and TV3. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TV1, TV2 and TV3 were distantly related to members of the genus Kobuvirus. Among the three turdiviruses, TV2 and TV3 were always clustered together, with high bootstrap supports of 1000. The genomic features of TV2 and TV3 were also distinct from TV1, including lower G+C contents, shorter leader protein and a preference for codon sequence NNT rather than NNC for amino acids that can use either NNT or NNC as codons (P<0.001 by χ(2)-test).

The bacterial RhlE-like DEAD-box RNA helicases are among the least well studied of these enzymes. They are widespread especially among Proteobacteria, whose genomes often encode multiple homologs. The significance of the expansion and diversification of RhlE-like proteins for bacterial fitness has not yet been established. Here, we study the two RhlE homologs present in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that, in the course of evolution, RhlE1 and RhlE2 have diverged in their biological functions, molecular partners and RNA-dependent enzymatic activities. Whereas RhlE1 is mainly needed for growth in the cold, RhlE2 also acts as global post-transcriptional regulator, affecting the level of hundreds of cellular transcripts indispensable for both environmental adaptation and virulence. The global impact of RhlE2 is mediated by its unique C-terminal extension, which supports the RNA unwinding activity of the N-terminal domain as well as an RNA-dependent interaction with the RNase E endonuclease and the cellular RNA degradation machinery.

DESIGN A systematic review of the peer-reviewed and gray literature of home-based primary care and palliative care programs among Medicaid beneficiaries including dual eligibles. SETTING HBMC including home-based primary care and palliative care programs. PARTICIPANTS Studies describing Medicaid beneficiaries receiving HBMC. MEASUREMENTS Three groups of studies were included: those focused on HBMC specifically for Medicaid beneficiaries, studies that described the proportion of Medicaid patients receiving HBMC, and those that used Medicaid status as a dependent variable in studying HBMC. RESULTS The peer-reviewed and gray literature searches revealed 574 unique studies of which only 16 met inclusion criteria. Few publications described HBMC as an integral care delivery model for Medicaid programs. Data from the programs described suggest the use of HBMC for Medicaid beneficiaries can reduce healthcare costs. The addition of social supports to HBMC appears to convey additional savings and benefits. CONCLUSION This systematic literature review highlights the relative dearth of literature regarding the use and impact of HBMC in the Medicaid population. HBMC has great potential to reduce Medicaid costs, and innovative programs combining HBMC with social support systems need to be tested.","Zimbroff, Robert M; Ritchie, Christine S; Leff, Bruce; Sheehan, Orla C",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,579,1

METHODS In the PROSpective Cohort with Incident Stroke Berlin (PROSCIS-B), patients with first-ever ischemic stroke were followed for 3 years. The primary combined endpoint consisted of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality. Citrate-blood levels of endothelial MV (EMV), leukocyte-derived MV (LMV), monocytic MV (MMV), and platelet-derived MV (PMV) were measured using flow cytometry. Kaplan-Meier curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the effect of MV levels on the combined endpoint. RESULTS Five hundred seventy-one patients were recruited (median age 69 years; 39% female; median NIHSS 2, interquartile range 1-4) and 95 endpoints occurred. Patients with levels of EMV [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-4.9] or LMV (HR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.4-6.8) in the highest quartile were more likely to experience an event than participants with lower levels using the lowest quartile as reference category. The association was less pronounced for PMV (HR = 1.7, 95% CI 0.9-3.2) and absent for MMV (HR = 1.1, 95% CI 0.6-1.8). CONCLUSION High levels of EMV and LMV after stroke were associated with worse cardiovascular outcome within 3 years. These results reinforce that endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation affect the long-term prognosis after stroke. EMV and LMV might play a role in risk prediction for stroke patients. STUDY REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01363856. UID: NCT01363856.

Group IID-secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IID) is abundantly expressed in dendritic cells in lymphoid tissues and resolves the Th1 immune response by controlling the steady-state levels of anti-inflammatory lipids such as docosahexaenoic acid and its metabolites. Here, we show that psoriasis and contact dermatitis were exacerbated in Pla2g2d-null mice, whereas they were ameliorated in Pla2g2d-overexpressing transgenic mice, relative to littermate wild-type mice. These phenotypes were associated with concomitant alterations in the tissue levels of ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites, which had the capacity to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory and Th1/Th17-type cytokines in dendritic cells or lymph node cells. In the context of cancer, however, Pla2g2d deficiency resulted in marked attenuation of skin carcinogenesis, likely because of the augmented anti-tumor immunity. Altogether, these results underscore a general role of sPLA2-IID as an immunosuppressive sPLA2 that allows the microenvironmental lipid balance toward an anti-inflammatory state, exerting beneficial or detrimental impact depending upon distinct pathophysiological contexts in inflammation and cancer.","Miki, Yoshimi; Kidoguchi, Yuh; Sato, Mariko; Taketomi, Yoshitaka; Taya, Choji; Muramatsu, Kazuaki; Gelb, Michael H; Yamamoto, Kei; Murakami, Makoto",The Journal of biological chemistry,579,17

While most patients are diagnosed in childhood, some present as adults. Laparoscopic Ladd's procedure is an accepted alternative to laparotomy in children but has not been well-studied in adults. This study was designed to investigate outcomes for adults undergoing laparoscopic Ladd's repair for malrotation. METHODS We performed a single-institution retrospective chart review over 11 years. Data collected included patient age, details of pre-operative work-up and diagnosis, surgical management, complications, rates of re-operation, and symptom resolution. Patients were evaluated on an intent-to-treat basis based on their planned operative approach. Categorical data were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Continuous data were analyzed using Student's t test. RESULTS Twenty-two patients were identified (age range 18-63). Fifteen were diagnosed pre-operatively; of the remaining seven patients, four received an intra-operative malrotation diagnosis during elective surgery for another problem. Most had some type of pre-operative imaging, with computed tomography being the most common (77.3 %). Comparing patients on an intent-to-treat basis, the two groups were similar with respect to age, operative time, and estimated blood loss. Six patients underwent successful laparoscopic repair; three began laparoscopically but were converted to laparotomy. There was a statistically significant difference in hospital length of stay (LOS) (5.0 ± 2.5 days vs 11.6 ± 8.1 days, p = 0.0148) favoring the laparoscopic approach. Three patients required re-operation: two underwent side-to-side duodeno-duodenostomy and one underwent a re-do Ladd's procedure. Ultimately, three (two laparoscopic, one open) had persistent symptoms of bloating (n = 2), constipation (n = 2), and/or pain (n = 1). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic repair appears to be safe and effective in adults. While a small sample size limits the power of this study, we found a statistically significant decrease in LOS and a trend toward decreased postoperative nasogastric decompression. There were no significant differences in complication rates, re-operation, or persistence of symptoms between groups.","Frasier, Lane L; Leverson, Glen; Gosain, Ankush; Greenberg, Jacob",Surgical endoscopy,579,1

Angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) converts angiotensin II to angiotensin (1-7) and thus, may protect against effects of angiotensin II. We hypothesized that ACE2 deficiency increases oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in cerebral arteries and examined the role of ACE2 in age-related cerebrovascular dysfunction. METHODS Endothelial function, expression of angiotensin system components, NADPH oxidase subunits, and proinflammatory cytokines were examined in cerebral arteries from adult (12 months old) and old (24 months old) ACE2 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. The superoxide scavenger tempol was used to examine the role of oxidative stress on endothelial function. RESULTS Vasodilatation to acetylcholine was impaired in adult ACE2 KO (24±6% [mean±SE]) compared with WT mice (52±7%; P<0.05). In old mice, vasodilatation to acetylcholine was impaired in WT mice (29±6%) and severely impaired in ACE2 KO mice (7±5%). Tempol improved endothelial function in adult and old ACE2 KO and WT mice. Aging increased mRNA for tumor necrosis factor-α in WT mice, and significantly increased mRNA levels of NAPDH oxidase 2, p47(phox), and Regulator of calcineurin 1 in both ACE2 KO and WT mice. mRNA levels of angiotensin system components did not change during aging. CONCLUSIONS ACE2 deficiency impaired endothelial function in cerebral arteries from adult mice and augmented endothelial dysfunction during aging. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in cerebrovascular dysfunction induced by ACE2 deficiency and aging.","Peña Silva, Ricardo A; Chu, Yi; Miller, Jordan D; Mitchell, Ian J; Penninger, Josef M; Faraci, Frank M; Heistad, Donald D",Stroke,579,31

The rate of origin of higher-level taxa is therefore the product of the rate of speciation times the probability that two new species coexist long enough to reach a particular level of divergence. Here I have explored these two parameters of disparification in bacteria. Owing to low recombination rates, sexual isolation is not a necessary milestone of bacterial speciation. Rather, irreversible and indefinite divergence begins with ecological diversification, that is, transmission of a bacterial lineage to a new ecological niche, possibly to a new microhabitat but at least to new resources. Several algorithms use sequence data from a taxon of focus to identify phylogenetic groups likely to bear the dynamic properties of species. Identifying these newly divergent lineages allows us to characterize the genetic bases of speciation, as well as the ecological dimensions upon which new species diverge. Speciation appears to be least frequent when a given lineage has few new resources it can adopt, as exemplified by photoautotrophs, C1 heterotrophs, and obligately intracellular pathogens; speciation is likely most rapid for generalist heterotrophs. The genetic basis of ecological divergence may determine whether ecological divergence is irreversible and whether lineages will diverge indefinitely into the future. Long-term coexistence is most likely when newly divergent lineages utilize at least some resources not shared with the other and when the resources themselves will coexist into the remote future.","Cohan, Frederick M",Microbiology spectrum,579,24

There may be delays to symptom relief due to travel to the person's home. In a randomised controlled trial (RCT) previously reported, nasal fentanyl (NF) or buccal midazolam (BM) were administered by lay carers in a hospice. OBJECTIVE (1) To report experiences of lay carers who administered NF and BM for symptom control and (2) To use feedback to develop guidance informing a future definitive RCT to determine whether NF and BM administered by lay carers can lead to timely, improved symptom control for people dying at home and fewer 'emergency' community nursing visits than standard breakthrough medication administered by healthcare professionals. MATERIAL AND METHODS Semistructured interviews with lay carers who gave trial medication were conducted. Interview data were analysed using a stage by stage method to code and categorise transcripts. FINDINGS The six themes were: (1) Participation-lay carers welcomed the opportunity to administer medication; (2) Ease of use-lay carers found preparations easy to use; (3) How things could have been done differently-lay carers would have liked access to trial drugs at home; (4) Training-lay carers were happy with the training they received; (5) Timing-lay carers liked the immediacy of trial drugs and (6) Evaluation-assessing symptom intensity and drug efficacy. CONCLUSIONS Participation was acceptable to patients and lay carers, and beneficial for symptom relief. The findings will inform planning for a future community-based study.","Perkins, Paul; Parkinson, Anne; Taylor, Vanessa; Husbands, Emma",BMJ supportive & palliative care,579,29

METHODS Patients eligible for elective laparoscopic right or left hemicolectomy or anterior resection of rectum were randomly assigned to either the use of Ligasure or Ultracision. The primary end point was intraoperative reduction of blood loss. Secondary end points were intraoperative and postoperative morbidity and operative time. RESULTS Between April 2005 and December 2006, 140 consecutive patients were included in the study (70 Ligasure and 70 Ultracision. We performed 31 right hemicolectomies, 69 left hemicolectomies, and 40 anterior resections of rectum. Blood loss was 109.6 ml (Ultracision 107.9 ml vs. Ligasure 111.2 ml, P value = 0.72). Intraoperative complication rate was 2.8 percent (Ultracision 1.4 percent vs. Ligasure 4.2 percent, P value < 0.01). Postoperative mortality was 0.7 percent.

METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of all MT patients between January 2015 and May 2018. Successful recanalization was defined as a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b-3. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) was defined according to European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study 3. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 at 3 months indicated good outcome. RESULTS MT was performed in 410 patients: 221 DTC and 189 DS. Median NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 16 and premorbid mRS score was 0. Thrombolysis was applied in 62.2% with the same time from symptom onset in both groups (94.5 vs 95 minutes). Successful recanalization (79.3% vs 77.8%) and NIHSS score reduction from admission to discharge (16-7 vs 17-6) were comparable. Time delay from onset to revascularization was 96 minutes in DS (212 vs 308 minutes, p = 0.001). At follow-up, DTC patients had a trend to better outcome (33.5% vs 24.3%, p = 0.056). Neither sICH (6.3% vs 5.9%, p = 0.840) nor mortality (31.2% vs 34.4%, p = 0.387) differed between the groups. CONCLUSION DS patients benefit from MT without relevant safety concerns, but with a trend to unfavorable outcome compared to DTC patients. These results suggest that DS is suitable to provide MT in rural areas where DTC is not possible.","Feil, Katharina; Rémi, Jan; Küpper, Clemens; Herzberg, Moriz; Dorn, Franziska; Kunz, Wolfgang G; Rotkopf, Lukas T; Heinrich, Johanna; Müller, Katharina; Laub, Christoph; Levin, Johannes; Hüttemann, Katrin; Dabitz, Rainer; Müller, Robert; Wollenweber, Frank A; Pfefferkorn, Thomas; Hamann, Gerhard F; Liebig, Thomas; Dieterich, Marianne; Kellert, Lars",Neurology,579,1

Previous reports have shown satisfactory short-term oncologic results. We evaluated the safety and short-term outcomes in rectal cancer subjects who underwent transanal minilaparoscopy-assisted natural orifice surgery total mesorectal excision (TME) rectal resection. METHODS Twenty selected patients with rectal cancer were enrolled onto a prospective study of minilaparoscopy-assisted natural orifice surgery TME rectal resection. The study endpoints were safety of access (intra- or postoperative morbidity) and adequacy of oncological resection criteria; intact TME; distal and circumferential margins; and number of lymph nodes retrieved. RESULTS All procedures were successfully completed with the transanal NOTES and minilaparoscopy technique. The mean age was 65 ± 10 years; 55% of patients were male; the mean body mass index was 25.3 ± 3.8 kg/m(2). Thirty-five percent of tumors were in the distal rectum, 50% in midrectum, and 15% in proximal rectum. Coloanal anastomoses were hand sewn in 65% and stapled in 35%. Mean operative time was 235 ± 56 min. There were no procedure-related complications. Pathologic analysis demonstrated negative distal and circumferential margins in all patients. An average of 15.9 ± 4.3 lymph nodes were retrieved. The mesorectal fascia was intact in all the specimens. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that transanal NOTES with minilaparoscopic assistance in the hands of a specialized team is safe; meets the oncologic requirements for high-quality rectal cancer surgery; and may offer advantages over pure laparoscopic approaches for visualizing and dissecting out the distal mesorectum. Minilaparoscopic assistance allows one to compensate for the limitations of current NOTES instrumentation to ensure the safety and adequacy of oncologic resection in these difficult cases. Careful patient selection, a specialized team, and long-term outcome evaluation are critical before this procedure can be considered for routine clinical use.","de Lacy, Antonio M; Rattner, David W; Adelsdorfer, Cedric; Tasende, Marta M; Fernández, María; Delgado, Salvadora; Sylla, Patricia; Martínez-Palli, Graciela",Surgical endoscopy,579,16

However, the benefits of energy innovation have not been experienced across various sectors in Swedish economy, and it might be anticipated that the potential aim of achieving carbon neutrality might not be accomplished to the fullest. Hence, being faced with the need of policy realignment for Sweden, this study has made an attempt to discover the dynamics between carbon tax revenue and energy innovation over a period of 1990-2019, following Quantile-on-Quantile Regression framework. The results obtained from the study show that the impact of carbon tax revenue on energy innovation might turn out to be ineffective beyond a certain threshold limit. A similar pattern has also been observed for the impact of energy innovation on carbon tax revenue. This study gives an indication that there might be a non-linear association between both these model parameters. The study outcomes have paved a way to design a policy framework for helping Swedish economy to attain the objectives of Sustainable Development Goals, while paving the ways to achieve carbon neutrality.","Cheng, Ya; Sinha, Avik; Ghosh, Vinit; Sengupta, Tuhin; Luo, Huawei",Journal of environmental management,579,24

Approximately 45-90% of affected individuals with DOA harbor pathogenic variants in the OPA1 gene. The mutation spectrum of OPA1 comprises nonsense, canonical and non-canonical splice site, frameshift and missense as well as copy number variants, but intragenic inversions have not been reported so far. CASE PRESENTATION We report a 33-year-old male with characteristic clinical features of DOA. Whole-genome sequencing identified a structural variant of 2.4 kb comprising an inversion of 937 bp at the OPA1 locus. Fine mapping of the breakpoints to single nucleotide level revealed that the structural variation was an inversion flanked by two deletions. As this rearrangement inverts the entire first exon of OPA1, it was classified as likely pathogenic. CONCLUSIONS We report the first DOA case harboring an inversion in the OPA1 gene. Our study demonstrates that copy-neutral genomic rearrangements have to be considered as a possible cause of disease in DOA cases.","Weisschuh, Nicole; Mazzola, Pascale; Heinrich, Tilman; Haack, Tobias; Wissinger, Bernd; Tonagel, Felix; Kelbsch, Carina",BMC medical genetics,579,1

A multidisciplinary approach to the selection and application of these agents requires input from all members of the surgical team including surgeons, perioperative nurses, blood bank specialists, and pharmacists. However, pharmacist knowledge regarding topical hemostats may be limited based on lack of formal education within college of pharmacy curricula as well as their use being predominantly in the operating room setting. Furthermore, some of these agents might be procured through central supply rather than the hospital pharmacy. Topical hemostats include agents that act as a mechanical barrier to bleeding and provide a physical matrix for clotting, biologically active agents that catalyze coagulation, combination therapies, and synthetic sealants and adhesives. Although many of the topical hemostats were approved for use before the requirement for clinical trials, this review provides an overview of the available clinical evidence regarding the appropriate uses and safety considerations associated with these agents. Proper use of these agents is vital to achieving the best clinical outcomes. Specifically, knowledge of the contraindications and potential adverse events associated with topical hemostats can help prevent unwanted outcomes. Therefore, an understanding of the benefits and potential risks associated with these agents will allow hospital pharmacists to assist in the development and implementation of institutional policies regarding the safe and effective use of hemostatic agents commonly used in the surgical suite.","Gabay, Michael; Boucher, Bradley A",Pharmacotherapy,579,8

Patient decision aids (PtDAs) are tools used in clinical practices to facilitate active patient involvement in healthcare decision-making. Nonetheless, PtDA effects have not been systematically evaluated for hip and knee total joint arthroplasty (TJA) decision-making. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the effect of patient decision aids compared to alternative of care on quality and process of decision-making when provided to adults with hip and knee osteoarthritis considering primary elective TJA. METHODS This systematic review will follow the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. This protocol was reported based on the PRISMA-P checklist guidelines. Studies will be searched in CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Eligible studies will be randomized control trial (RCT) evaluating the effect of PtDA on TJA decision-making. Descriptive and meta-analysis of outcomes will include decision quality (knowledge and values-based choice), decisional conflict, patient involvement, decision-making process satisfaction, actual decision made, health outcomes, and harm(s). Risk of bias will be evaluated with Cochrane's risk of bias tool for RCTs. Quality and strength of recommendations will be appraised with Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). DISCUSSION This review will provide a summary of RCT findings on PtDA effect on decision-making quality and process of adults with knee and hip osteoarthritis considering primary elective TJA. Further, it will provide evidence comparing different types of PtDA used for TJA decision-making.

Clinical studies comparing 21% and 100% O(2) included many infants with only mild and moderate asphyxia. OBJECTIVES We aimed to investigate the effect of these oxygen fractions on haemodynamic parameters, arterial blood gases, oxygen saturation indices and markers of inflammation and hypoxic damage when resuscitating asystolic newborn pigs following asphyxia. METHODS Newborn swine (n = 32, age 12-36 h, weight 2.0-2.7 kg) were progressively asphyxiated until asystole occurred. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated with ventilation with either 21% (n = 16) or 100% O(2) (n = 16). Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was defined as a heart rate >or= 100 min(-1). RESULTS Mean time of hypoxia, pH, base excess and pCO(2) at asystole were comparable between the groups. All animals except 2 in the 100% group achieved ROSC. One animal in the 21% group suffered bradycardia at baseline and was excluded. For the remaining 15 animals resuscitated with 21% O(2), median time to ROSC (interquartile range) was 150 s (115-180), whereas animals in the 100% group achieved ROSC after 135 s (113-168); p = 0.80. There were no differences in the temporal changes in mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, pH, pCO(2), interleukin-1beta or lactate/pyruvate ratios. However, systemic and regional cerebral oxygen saturations were higher in the animals resuscitated with 100% oxygen. CONCLUSION In this animal model of severe perinatal asphyxia, resuscitation with room air seemed to be as safe and effective as the use of 100% oxygen.","Solevåg, Anne L; Dannevig, Ingrid; Nakstad, Britt; Saugstad, Ola D",Neonatology,579,17

Study procedures were performed before and after indacaterol and placebo treatments according to a cross-over, randomized, double-blind protocol in forty-four patients (27 on bisoprolol and 17 on carvedilol). No differences between indacaterol and placebo were observed in the whole population except for a significantly higher VE/VCO2 slope and lower maximal PETCO2 during exercise with indacaterol, entirely due to the difference in the bisoprolol group (VE/VCO2 31.8 ± 5.9 vs. 28.5 ± 5.6, p < 0.0001 and maximal PETCO2 36.7 ± 5.5 vs. 37.7 ± 5.8 mmHg, p < 0.02 with indacaterol and placebo, respectively). In carvedilol, indacaterol was associated with a higher peak heart rate (119 ± 34 vs. 113 ± 30 bpm, with indacaterol and placebo) and a lower prevalence of hypopnea during sleep (3.8 [0.0;6.3] vs. 5.8 [2.9;10.5] events/hour, with indacaterol and placebo).

OBJECTIVE This study examines the evidence behind this recommendation because severe injuries can result from motorcycle crashes and patients can benefit from treatment at higher-level trauma centers. METHODS This retrospective cohort study used the National Trauma Data Bank 2015 dataset. We conducted descriptive analyses (univariate and bivariate) followed by adjusted multivariate analysis to examine the association between trauma center designation levels and survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS A total of 28,821 patients with motorcycle injuries were included. Most patients were men (n = 25,361; 88%) and aged between 16 and 64 years (n = 26,989; 93.6%). Survival rates were higher in level II (n = 10,658; 95.3%) and III (n = 2,129; 95.5%) trauma centers compared to level I centers (n = 14,498; 94.6%). After adjusting for confounders, decreased survival to hospital discharge was noted for patients treated at level III trauma centers compared to those at level I centers (odds ratio 0.543; 95% confidence interval 0.390-0.729). No difference in survival was noted between level I and II centers. CONCLUSIONS Patients with motorcycle crash-related injuries treated at higher-level trauma center (I or II) had increased survival. This warrants a re-evaluation and adjustment of the field triage criterion for such patients.

This review aimed to summarize characteristics of measurement tools used to assess screen time in young children; evaluate reporting of psychometric properties; and examine time trends related to measurement and reporting of screen time. A systematic review of articles published in English across three databases from January 2009 to April 2020 was undertaken using PROSPERO protocol (registration: CRD42019132599) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Included articles measured screen time as outcome, exposure, or confounder in children 0-6 years. The search identified 35,868 records, 1035 full-text articles were screened for eligibility, and 622 met inclusion criteria. Most measures (60%) consisted of one to three items and assessed duration of screen time on a usual day. Few measures assessed content (11%) or coviewing (7%). Only 40% of articles provided a citation for the measure, and only 69 (11%) reported psychometric properties-reliability n = 58, validity n = 19, reliability and validity n = 8. Between 2009 and 2019, the number of published articles increased from 28 to 71. From 2015, there was a notable increase in the proportion of articles published each year that assessed exposure to mobile devices in addition to television. The increasing number of published articles reflects increasing interest in screen time exposure among young children. Measures of screen time have generally evolved to reflect children's contemporary digital landscape; however, the psychometric properties of measurement tools are rarely reported. There is a need for improved measures and reporting to capture the complexity of children's screen time exposures.","Byrne, Rebecca; Terranova, Caroline O; Trost, Stewart G",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,579,1

Here we show that the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) scavenger receptor B type 1 (SR-B1) facilitates ACE2-dependent entry of SARS-CoV-2. We find that the S1 subunit of SARS-2-S binds to cholesterol and possibly to HDL components to enhance viral uptake in vitro. SR-B1 expression facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into ACE2-expressing cells by augmenting virus attachment. Blockade of the cholesterol-binding site on SARS-2-S1 with a monoclonal antibody, or treatment of cultured cells with pharmacological SR-B1 antagonists, inhibits HDL-enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection. We further show that SR-B1 is coexpressed with ACE2 in human pulmonary tissue and in several extrapulmonary tissues. Our findings reveal that SR-B1 acts as a host factor that promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry and may help explain viral tropism, identify a possible molecular connection between COVID-19 and lipoprotein metabolism, and highlight SR-B1 as a potential therapeutic target to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wei, Congwen; Wan, Luming; Yan, Qiulin; Wang, Xiaolin; Zhang, Jun; Yang, Xiaopan; Zhang, Yanhong; Fan, Chen; Li, Dongyu; Deng, Yongqiang; Sun, Jin; Gong, Jing; Yang, Xiaoli; Wang, Yufei; Wang, Xuejun; Li, Jianmin; Yang, Huan; Li, Huilong; Zhang, Zhe; Wang, Rong; Du, Peng; Zong, Yulong; Yin, Feng; Zhang, Wanchuan; Wang, Nan; Peng, Yumeng; Lin, Haotian; Feng, Jiangyue; Qin, Chengfeng; Chen, Wei; Gao, Qi; Zhang, Rui; Cao, Yuan; Zhong, Hui",Nature metabolism,579,22

METHODS To develop the MDcpg2020 , the mood disorders committee conducted an extensive review of the available literature to develop evidence-based recommendations (EBR) based on National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guidelines. In the MDcpg2020, these recommendations sit alongside consensus-based recommendations (CBR) that were derived from extensive deliberations of the mood disorders committee, who drew on their expertise and clinical experience. Therefore, this guideline summary is an abridged version that focuses on major depression. In collaboration with international experts in the field, it synthesises the key recommendations made in relation to the diagnosis and management of major depression. RESULTS The depression summary provides a systematic approach to diagnosis, and a logical clinical framework for management. The latter begins with Actions, which include important strategies that should be implemented from the outset. These include lifestyle changes, psychoeducation and psychological interventions. The summary advocates the use of antidepressants in the management of depression as Choices and nominates seven medications that can be trialled as clinically indicated before moving to Alternatives for managing depression. Subsequent strategies regarding Medication include Increasing Dose, Augmenting and Switching (MIDAS). The summary also recommends the use of ECT, and discusses how to approach non-response. CONCLUSIONS The major depression summary provides up to date guidance regarding the management of major depressive disorder, as set out in the MDcpg2020 .

Acute ingestion of anthocyanins improves postprandial glucose responses to a single carbohydrate-rich meal under strictly controlled conditions. PURPOSE Examine whether acute and short-term supplementation with anthocyanin-rich New Zealand blackcurrant (NZBC) extract can improve postprandial glucose responses to mixed-macronutrient meals. METHODS Twenty-five overweight (BMI > 25 kg m2) sedentary individuals participated in one of the following double-blinded, randomised controlled trials: (1) ingestion of 600 mg NZBC extract or placebo prior to consumption of a high-carbohydrate, high-fat liquid meal (n = 12); (2) 8-days supplementation with NZBC extract (600 mg day-1) or placebo, with insulin sensitivity and markers of inflammation assessed on day-7, and free-living postprandial glucose (continuous glucose monitoring) assessed on day-8 (n = 13). RESULTS A single dose of NZBC extract had no effect on 3 h postprandial glucose, insulin or triglyceride responses. However, in response to short-term NZBC extract supplementation insulin sensitivity was improved (+ 22%; P = 0.011), circulating C-reactive protein concentrations decreased (P = 0.008), and free-living postprandial glucose responses to both breakfast and lunch meals were reduced (- 9% and - 8%, respectively; P < 0.05), compared to placebo. CONCLUSION These novel results indicate that repeated intake, rather than a single dose of NZBC extract, is required to induce beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and postprandial glucose handling in individuals with overweight or obesity. Continuous glucose monitoring enabled an effect of NZBC extract to be observed under free-living conditions and highlights the potential of anthocyanin-rich supplements as a viable strategy to reduce insulin resistance.","Nolan, A; Brett, R; Strauss, J A; Stewart, C E; Shepherd, S O",European journal of nutrition,579,30

Energy-based electrosurgical and ultrasonic devices are often used to replace sutures and mechanical clips to provide rapid hemostasis and decrease surgery time. Some of these devices may create undesirably large collateral zones of thermal damage and tissue necrosis, or require separate mechanical blades for cutting. Infrared lasers are currently being explored as alternative energy sources for vessel sealing applications. In a previous study, a 1470-nm laser was used to seal vessels 1 to 6 mm in diameter in 5 s, yielding burst pressures of ∼500 mmHg. The purpose of this study was to provide vessel sealing times comparable with current energy-based devices, incorporate transection of sealed vessels, and demonstrate high vessel burst pressures to provide a safety margin for future clinical use. A 110-W, 1470-nm laser beam was transmitted through a fiber and beam shaping optics, producing a 90-W linear beam 3.0 by 9.5 mm for sealing (400 W/cm2), and 1.1 by 9.6 mm for cutting (1080 W/cm2). A two-step process sealed and then transected ex vivo porcine renal vessels (1.5 to 8.5 mm diameter) in a bench top setup. Seal and cut times were 1.0 s each. A burst pressure system measured seal strength, and histologic measurements of lateral thermal spread were also recorded. All blood vessels tested (n=55 seal samples) were sealed and cut, with total irradiation times of 2.0 s and mean burst pressures of 1305±783 mmHg. Additional unburst vessels were processed for histological analysis, showing a lateral thermal spread of 0.94±0.48 mm (n=14 seal samples). This study demonstrated that an optical-based system is capable of precisely sealing and cutting a wide range of porcine renal vessel sizes and, with further development, may provide an alternative to radiofrequency- and ultrasonic-based vessel sealing devices.","Giglio, Nicholas C; Hutchens, Thomas C; Perkins, William C; Latimer, Cassandra; Ward, Arlen; Nau, William H; Fried, Nathaniel M",Journal of biomedical optics,579,31

Many studies have found associations between SN and indicators of poor health outcomes, such as smoking, low socioeconomic status and obesity. However, less is known about the prevalence of this organism and more specifically about other oral site-specific locations that may harbor this organism. METHODS Using an existing patient repository (n = 47) of DNA isolated from saliva and other oral sites (n = 235), including the dorsum of the tongue, lower lingual incisor, upper buccal molar and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), molecular screening for SN was performed. Screening results were analyzed for associations between demographic variables (age, sex, race/ethnicity) and clinical information (body mass index or BMI, presence of orthodontic brackets, primary/mixed/permanent dentition). RESULTS qPCR screening revealed a total of n = 62/235 sites or 26.3% harboring SN with saliva and GCF (either alone or in combination with one or more sites) most often observed (Saliva, n = 23/27 or 85.18%, GCF, n = 14/27 or 51%). Analysis of site-specific data revealed most positive results were found among saliva and GCF alone or in combination, with fewer positive results observed among the tongue (33.3%), lower lingual incisor (29.6%), and upper buccal molar (25.9%). No significant associations were found between demographic or clinical variables and presence of SN at any site. CONCLUSIONS These results may be among the first to describe site-specific locations of S. noxia among various additional oral biofilm sites. These data may represent a significant advancement in our understanding of the sites and locations that harbor this organism, which may be important for our understanding of the prevalence and distribution of these organisms among patients of different ages undergoing different types of oral treatments, such as orthodontic treatment or therapy.","McDaniel, Jaydene; McDaniel, Steven; Samiano, Beanca Jhanine; Marrujo, Matthew; Kingsley, Karl; Howard, Katherine M",Current issues in molecular biology,579,30

A total of 26 diagnosis and treatment protocols of TCM for COVID-19 were retrieved after screening(including 1 national scheme and 25 regional ones), among which 16 contained aspects of both prevention and treatment, 7 only involved treatment contents and 3 were prevention schemes. The courses of COVID-19 can be divided into early stage, middle stage, severe stage and recovery stage. The pathogeny of COVID-19 in TCM is damp-toxin, with the core pathogenesis of damp-toxin retention in lung and Qi repression. Its pathological features can be summarized as ""damp, toxin, obstruction, deficiency"". The location of the disease is lung, always involving spleen and stomach, and may further affect heart and kidney in severe cases. The major treatments for each course are Fanghua Shizuo, Xuanfei Touxie(early stage); Qingre Jiedu, Xuanxie Feire(middle stage); Kaibi Gutuo, Huiyang Jiuni(severe stage); Qingjie Yure, Yiqi Yangyin(recovery stage). There were many diagnosis and treatment protocols for COVID-19 have been published, which generally followed the national edition, through with certain personalities in different regional protocols.

We examined overall survival (OS) in patients with RA and solid malignancies receiving bDMARDs. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with RA and solid malignancies seen at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2002 and 2014. Cox proportional hazard regression models, stratified by tumor type and stage, were fit evaluating use of bDMARDs as a time fixed and time varying covariate. RESULTS We identified 431 RA patients with solid malignancies: 111 (26%) received bDMARDs after their cancer diagnosis. Median OS from cancer diagnosis was 16.1 years. Of the patients receiving bDMARDs, most had localized disease, and only 14 (13%) had advanced cancer. In the stratified Cox models no statistically significant differences were observed between patients who received tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) or patients who received nonTNFi, compared with those who did not receive bDMARDs (hazard ratio (HR), 0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.31, 1.44; HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.26, 4.60 respectively). In breast cancer patients, those receiving TNFi or nonTNFi had a numerically higher but statistically nonsignificant HR compared with those who did not receive bDMARD: HR, 1.40 (95% CI, 0.42, 4.73), and HR, 1.37 (95% CI, 0.22, 8.42) respectively. CONCLUSION No significant differences in OS were observed between patients who received bDMARDs and those who did not. Additional data is needed to evaluate other cancer outcomes such as recurrence and progression, and patients with advanced cancer. Key Points •We found no statistically significant differences in OS between patients with RA and concomitant solid malignancies who received bDMARDs and those who did not. •Most patients who received bDMARDs had been diagnosed with early stage cancer •As few patients with advanced cancer received bDMARDs safety for this group cannot be established •No significant differences were observed between TNFi and nonTNFi, but the sample size was small.","Pundole, Xerxes; Zamora, Natalia V; Siddhanamatha, Harish; Lin, Heather; Tayar, Jean; Leung, Cheuk Hong; Li, Liang; Suarez-Almazor, Maria E",Clinical rheumatology,579,31

There has been an unprecedented rise in the use of personal protective equipment and practice of personal hygiene measures against COVID-19. The extended use of protective measures (PM) can lead to ill effects on the skin. Our aim was to investigate PM-induced dermatoses amongst healthcare workers and the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted over a period of 2 months. The study subjects were patients who presented to dermatology outpatient clinics or sought teleconsultation for skin problems related to the use of PMs against COVID-19. A detailed history was obtained and cutaneous examination was documented for all the patients in a pre-set proforma. Diagnoses of the adverse skin effects were formulated based upon history and clinical examination. RESULTS A total of 101 cases with cutaneous adverse effects due to the use of PMs against COVID-19 were included in the study. The general population and healthcare workers were affected similarly, comprising of 54.5% and 45.5%, respectively. The mean age of the study participants was 36.71 ± 15.72 years. The most common culprit material was soap and water (56.4%). Contact dermatitis was found to be the most common adverse effect in the majority of our patients (72.3%). The most common symptom reported was pruritus (45.5%). The wearing of personal protective equipment for a longer duration was significantly associated with multiple symptoms (P = 0.026). CONCLUSION The enhanced use of different PMs against COVID-19 can result in a variety of adverse skin effects. In our study, the use of soap and water was the most common culprit PM, and contact dermatitis was the most common adverse effect noted.","Mushtaq, Sabha; Terzi, Erdinc; Recalcati, Sebastiano; Salas-Alanis, Julio C; Amin, Sanober; Faizi, Nafis",International journal of dermatology,579,1

Internet-based treatment for problematic alcohol use, specifically, has been found to show results on par with other forms of treatment. However, in-depth knowledge of users' experiences is required to understand what works, and what needs further development. The aim of this study is to investigate the help-seeking motives among users of an internet-based service for problematic alcohol use, as well as the users' experiences of the support available through the service. METHOD The study consists of a thematic analysis of interviews with 38 former users of the internet-based intervention Alkoholhjälpen. RESULTS The analysis shows that health and relationship factors, as well as feelings of shame, were important motives for the users' decisions to reduce their drinking. Availability and anonymity seem to have been important reasons for choosing internet-based support. The different treatment components, i.e. ICBT program, therapist support and discussion forum, were each perceived as helpful by some users but not by others. Treatment components were described as more useful when users were able to personally identify with the content, and when it helped them reflect on their own alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS There are several aspects that are relevant, beyond the comparison between components, if we want to understand what works and for whom in internet-based treatment. Internet-based treatment services should be generous in terms of options for the users.","Ekström, Veronica; Johansson, Magnus",Addiction science & clinical practice,579,15

We can expect many to die prematurely secondary to COVID-19 across the United States. We present a case of how several hospital systems-based interventions, intended to slow viral spread and to protect health care workers, have inadvertently created barriers to routine palliative interventions in this patient population. Isolation of patients, limitation of visitors and interdisciplinary support, and changes in nursing and provider assessment have all had their impact on how we deliver palliative care. These barriers have altered many aspects of our established workflow and algorithms for care, including changes in communication, goals of care discussions, how providers and nurses are monitoring for symptoms, and end-of-life monitoring. These challenges required real-time solutions such as technology utilization, proposing a change in medical delivery systems, and reducing redundancy to preserve personal protective equipment.

Sharing best practices in population health nursing education is especially critical now, in the era of COVID-19, when more nurses will be called to apply public health principles to patient care regardless of their work setting. Although evidence from national nursing education bodies outline several critical implications for nursing curricula, undergraduate nursing programs lack operational guidance for instituting effective curricular changes to population health nursing teaching and learning. The purpose of this paper is to outline the process by which a college of nursing translated this evidence into innovation through program development of a yearlong Population Health Internship (PHI) in its BSN program. The inaugural PHI cohort placed 81 nursing students in 19 population health agencies to work with 64 interprofessional mentors. The author details the six steps taken to operationalize the curricular innovation to enable replication by others. Initial student evaluation data show participation in the PHI enables positive mentor relationships and exposes students to roles of population health nurses and the scope of their activities. Community agency evaluation data indicate satisfaction with the yearlong model, noting that nursing intern contributions extended agency missions.","Fricas, Jennifer",Journal of professional nursing : official journal of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing,579,24

There is evidence that socio-economic position influences oral health behaviours, but little is known about this association during adolescence. This study aims to investigate the association between social disadvantage (individual- and area-level) and oral health behaviours among Australian adolescents. METHODS This study utilised data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). The sample consisted of 2877 adolescents. Exposure measures were area-level social disadvantage (Socioeconomic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA)), and parent-reported household income from Wave 5. Outcomes, measured in Wave 6, wereadolescent-reported oral health behaviours: frequency of brushing, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and dental visits. Associations between quintiles of each exposure and each oral health behaviour were tested by fitting multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS Household income and area-level disadvantage were associated with dental visits and brushing frequency. Associations between social disadvantage and consumption of SSBs was less apparent, with only the leastdisadvantaged adolescentshaving lower odds of consumption of SSBs compared to the mostdisadvantaged group.

Conversely, dissecting the splenic vein with the pancreatic parenchyma is easy and time-saving. Objective To establish the safety of combined division of the splenic vein compared with separate division of the splenic vein. Design, Setting, and Participants This study was designed as a multicenter prospective randomized phase 3 trial. All results were analyzed using the modified intent-to-treat set. Patients undergoing DP for pancreatic body and tail tumors were eligible for inclusion. Patients were randomly assigned between August 10, 2016, and July 30, 2019. Interventions Patients were centrally randomized (1:1) to either separate division of the splenic vein or combined division of the splenic vein. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was the incidence of grade B/C PF, and the incidence of intra-abdominal hemorrhage was included as one of the secondary end points. Results A total of 318 patients were randomly assigned, and 2 patients were excluded as ineligible. Of the 316 remaining patients, 150 (50.3%) were male. The modified intent-to-treat population constituted 159 patients (50.3%) in the separate division group and 157 patients (49.7%) in the combined division group. In the modified intent-to-treat set, the proportion of grade B/C PF in the separate division group was 27.1% (42 of 155) vs 28.6% (44 of 154) in the combined division group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.108; 95% CI, 0.847-1.225; P = .047), demonstrating noninferiority of the combined division of the splenic vein against separate division. The incidence of postoperative intra-abdominal hemorrhage in the 2 groups was identical at 1.3%. Conclusions and Relevance This study demonstrated noninferiority of the combined division of the splenic vein compared with separate division of the splenic vein regarding safety.

METHODS Crohn´s disease patients, who failed anti-TNF treatment and started vedolizumab or ustekinumab in standard care as second-line biological, were identified in the observational prospective Dutch Initiative on Crohn and Colitis Registry. Corticosteroid-free clinical remission (Harvey Bradshaw Index ≤4), biochemical remission (C-reactive protein ≤5 mg/L and fecal calprotectin ≤250 µg/g), combined corticosteroid-free clinical and biochemical remission, and safety outcomes were compared after 52 weeks of treatment. To adjust for confounding and selection bias, we used multiple logistic regression and propensity score matching. RESULTS In total, 128 vedolizumab- and 85 ustekinumab-treated patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. After adjusting for confounders, ustekinumab-treated patients were more likely to achieve corticosteroid-free clinical remission (odds ratio [OR]: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.36-4.90, P = 0.004), biochemical remission (OR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.10-4.96, P = 0.027), and combined corticosteroid-free clinical and biochemical remission (OR: 2.74, 95% CI: 1.23-6.09, P = 0.014), while safety outcomes (infections: OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 0.63-2.54, P = 0.517; adverse events: OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 0.62-2.81, P = 0.464; hospitalisations: OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.32-1.39, P = 0.282) were comparable between the two groups.

In 1699, the Health Council of the Republic of Lucca founded the ""sanatorium"" concept as place of care and isolation. In 1865 Villemain inoculated tubercular material from a human lymph node into a rabbit, obtaining for the first time the typical tubercular lesions. Some years later, on March 24, 1882, Robert Koch announced to the Berlin Society of Physiology the discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In the same period Virchow improved awareness of risk factors and correct behaviours among the general population. In 1952 Waksman won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the first active drug against TB: streptomycin. Nevertheless, drug resistance appeared rapidly some years later and it is still a great challenge in TB fight nowadays.","Riccardi, N; Canetti, D; Martini, M; Diaw, M M; DI Biagio, A; Codecasa, L; Barberis, I; Bragazzi, N L; Besozzi, G",Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,579,31

Here, we show that exosomes produced by naive bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM-exo) contain anti-inflammatory microRNA-99a/146b/378a that are further increased in exosomes produced by BMDM polarized with IL-4 (BMDM-IL-4-exo). These exosomal microRNAs suppress inflammation by targeting NF-κB and TNF-α signaling and foster M2 polarization in recipient macrophages. Repeated infusions of BMDM-IL-4-exo into Apoe-/- mice fed a Western diet reduce excessive hematopoiesis in the bone marrow and thereby the number of myeloid cells in the circulation and macrophages in aortic root lesions. This also leads to a reduction in necrotic lesion areas that collectively stabilize atheroma. Thus, BMDM-IL-4-exo may represent a useful therapeutic approach for atherosclerosis and other inflammatory disorders by targeting NF-κB and TNF-α via microRNA cargo delivery.","Bouchareychas, Laura; Duong, Phat; Covarrubias, Sergio; Alsop, Eric; Phu, Tuan Anh; Chung, Allen; Gomes, Michael; Wong, David; Meechoovet, Bessie; Capili, Allyson; Yamamoto, Ryo; Nakauchi, Hiromitsu; McManus, Michael T; Carpenter, Susan; Van Keuren-Jensen, Kendall; Raffai, Robert L",Cell reports,579,19

There has been a recent increase in the use of PROMIS measures, yet little has been written about the reporting of these measures in the field of orthopedics. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review to determine the uptake of PROMIS measures across orthopedics and to identify the type of PROMIS measures and domains that are most commonly used in orthopedic research and practice. METHODS We searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus using keywords and database-specific subject headings to capture orthopedic studies reporting PROMIS measures through November 2018. Our inclusion criteria were use of PROMIS measures as an outcome or used to describe a population of patients in an orthopedic setting in patients ≥ 18 years of age. We excluded non-quantitative studies, reviews, and case reports. RESULTS Our final search yielded 88 studies published from 2013 through 2018, with 57% (50 studies) published in 2018 alone. By body region, 28% (25 studies) reported PROMIS measures in the upper extremity (shoulder, elbow, hand), 36% (32 studies) reported PROMIS measures in the lower extremity (hip, knee, ankle, foot), 19% (17 studies) reported PROMIS measures in the spine, 10% (9 studies) reported PROMIS measures in trauma patients, and 6% (5 studies) reported PROMIS measures in general orthopedic patients. The majority of studies reported between one and three PROMIS domains (82%, 73 studies). The PROMIS Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) approach was most commonly used (81%, 72 studies). The most frequently reported PROMIS domains were physical function (81%, 71 studies) and pain interference (61%, 54 studies). CONCLUSION Our review found an increase in the reporting of PROMIS measures over the recent years. Utilization of PROMIS measures in orthopedic populations is clinically appropriate and can facilitate communication of outcomes across different provider types and with reduced respondent burden. REGISTRATION The protocol for this systematic review was designed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines and is registered with the PROSPERO database (CRD42018088260).","Horn, Maggie E; Reinke, Emily K; Couce, Logan J; Reeve, Bryce B; Ledbetter, Leila; George, Steven Z",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,579,16

However, recanalization fails in about 16.5% of interventions. We report our experience with unsuccessful MT and analyze technical reasons plus patient-related parameters for failure. METHODS Five hundred ninety-six patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation and intention to perform MT with an aspiration catheter and/or stent retriever were analyzed. Failure was defined as 0, 1, or 2a on the mTICI scale. Patients with failing MT were analyzed for interventional progress and compared to patients with successful intervention, whereby parameters included demographics, medical history, stroke presentation, and treatment. RESULTS One hundred of the 596 (16.8%) interventions failed. In 20 cases, thrombus could not be accessed or passed with the device. Peripheral arterial occlusive disease is common in those patients. In 80 patients, true stent retriever failure occurred. In this group, coagulation disorders are associated with poor results, whereas atrial fibrillation is associated with success. The administration of intravenous thrombolysis and intake of nitric oxide donors are associated with recanalization success. Intervention duration was significantly longer in the failing group. CONCLUSION In 20% of failing MT, thrombus cannot be reached/passed. Direct carotid puncture or surgical arterial access could be considered in these cases. In 80% of failing interventions, thrombus can be passed with the device, but the occluded vessel cannot be recanalized. Rescue techniques can be an option. Development of new devices and techniques is necessary to improve recanalization rates. Assessment of pre-existing illness could sensitize for occurring complications.","Heider, Dominik M; Simgen, Andreas; Wagenpfeil, Gudrun; Dietrich, Philipp; Yilmaz, Umut; Mühl-Benninghaus, Ruben; Roumia, Safwan; Faßbender, Klaus; Reith, Wolfgang; Kettner, Michael",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,579,1

These dressings consist of a skin interface layer that absorbs fluid from the skin surface and reduces the potential for microbial colonization within the dressing by means of ionic silver. This study examines the ability of silver to reduce the bioburden within the dressing as well as the localized effect due to potential silver mobility. Approach: Ability of silver to reduce bioburden within the ROCF-ciNPT dressing was assessed using Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida spp. Furthermore, silver mobility was assessed using an in vitro skin model to study the zone of inhibition along with released silver quantification. Using a porcine model, diffusion of silver into blood and tissue was studied using emission spectrometry and histology. Results: Microbial growth in the ROCF-ciNPT dressing was significantly reduced (∼2.7-4.9 log reduction) compared to a silver-free negative control. No zone of inhibition was observed for microbial colonies for up to 7 days with minimal localized silver release (<5.5 ppm release). In vivo studies demonstrated no measurable concentration (<0.2 μg/g) of silver in the blood, urine, feces, kidney, and liver tissue biopsy. Innovation: This study provides an important insight into silver concentration and mobility within the ROCF-ciNPT dressing, given emerging concerns associated with potential silver cytotoxicity. Conclusion: These results indicate the concentration of silver (0.019% silver by weight) in the ROCF-ciNPT dressings has been adequate to reduce bioburden within the skin interface layer, while severely limiting the amount of silver leaching out.","Kharkar, Prathamesh M; Osborne, Sandra N; Stern, Scout L; Pleitner, Aaron; Wiencek, K Mark; Kieswetter, Kristine M",Advances in wound care,579,1

Among these, the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) system is the most effective. However, the precise mechanism of GAD induction is unknown. We previously reported that a tolC mutant lacking the TolC outer membrane channel was defective in GAD induction. Here, we show that indole, a substrate of TolC-dependent efflux pumps and produced by the tryptophanase encoded by the tnaA gene, negatively regulates GAD expression. GAD expression was restored by deleting tnaA in the tolC mutant; in wild-type E. coli, it was suppressed by adding indole to the growth medium. RNA-sequencing revealed that tnaA mRNA levels drastically decreased upon exposure to moderately acidic conditions (pH 5.5). This decrease was suppressed by RNase E deficiency. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the RNase E-dependent degradation of tnaA mRNA is accelerated upon acid exposure, which decreases intracellular indole concentrations and triggers GAD induction.","Kanda, Takeshi; Abiko, Genta; Kanesaki, Yu; Yoshikawa, Hirofumi; Iwai, Noritaka; Wachi, Masaaki",Scientific reports,579,30

COVID-19 has posed a huge threat to public health and economic stability worldwide. CR3022, a human monoclonal neutralizing antibody isolated from a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) recovery patient, was confirmed to be able to bind the S protein of HCoV-19 with a certain degree of neutralizing activity. Crystal structural information indicated that CR3022 could bind to the epitope on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of HCoV-19, whose epitope consists of 28 amino acids, and 24 of them are conserved in SARS-CoV of SARS. However, the crystal structure is only a static conformation at a certain moment in time, and it cannot provide dynamic details of the interaction between antigen and antibody. METHODS In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation combined with MM/PBSA and CAS methods were performed to investigate the binding mechanism of binding of CR3022 against SARS-CoV-RBD and HCoV-19-RBD in order to determine their holographic dynamic information. RESULTS It was found that the CR3022-SARS-CoV-RBD complex was more stable during 100ns MD run than that of the CR3022-HCoV19-RBD system. There were common conservative amino acids on the β2 sheet of RBD, including Tyr369, Phe377, Lys378, Tyr380, Gly381, Lys386, Leu390 and others. These conservative amino acids play significant roles in the binding process of CR3022 antibody against SARS-CoV-RBD and HCoV-19-RBD. It was also found that the binding mode of CR3022 to its native target SARS-CoV-RBD is more comprehensive and uniform. Moreover, the β2 sheet residue Thr385 and non-β2 sheet residues Arg408 and Asp428 of the CR3022- SARS-CoV-RBD system were found to be crucial for their binding affinities, thus forming a special conformational epitope. However, these key amino acids are not present in the CR3022-HCoV-19-RBD system. The binding mode of CR3022 and HCoV-19-RBD is similar to that of SARS-CoV-RBD, but the deficiency of crucial hydrogen-bonds and salt-bridges. Therefore, the binding of CR3022 and HCoV19-RBD only draws on the partial mode of the binding of CR3022 and SARS-CoV-RBD, so there is a loss of affinity. CONCLUSION Thus, in order to better fight the epidemic of COVID-19 with the CR3022 antibody, this antibody needs to further improve the neutralization efficiency of HCoV-19 through mutation of it's CDR region.","Yu, Wei; Wu, Xiaomin; Ren, Jiayi; Zhang, Xiaochun; Wang, Yueming; Li, Chengming; Xu, Wenwen; Zheng, Weihong; Liao, Huaxin; Yuan, Xiaohui; Li, Jason; Li, Gang",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,579,1

An Amazon Mechanical Turk sample of 829 individuals was evaluated with a series of instruments assessing the severity of the OCRDs before and during the pandemic. Additional questionnaires about sociodemographic factors, personal and family histories of OCRD, COVID-19 related events, compulsivity and impulsivity traits, schizotypal symptoms, and the severity of depression, anxiety and stress levels, were also used. Participants reported that OCD, hoarding disorder (HD) and skin picking disorder (SPD) symptoms significantly worsened during the pandemic along with increased disability, more affective symptoms and reduced quality of life. Female gender, a higher number of COVID-19 related stressful events, and higher pre-COVID-19 fear of harm and symmetry symptoms predicted more severe OCD symptoms during the pandemic, whereas lack of a HD diagnosis by a mental health professional and more severe schizotypal symptoms predicted worsened hoarding symptoms. Greater compulsivity traits were associated with more severe COVID-19 pandemic obsessive-compulsive and hoarding symptoms. These data indicate that the immense distress resulting from the COVID-19 included significant deterioration of OCRDs' symptoms, particularly of OCD, HD and SPD. It was also possible to identify a pre-pandemic profile of people most at risk of pandemic-related deterioration in OCRDs' symptoms, which may prove valuable for preventative initiatives in relation to the likely future waves of COVID-19 or of other communicable diseases.

Older adults (>55 years of age) have been identified by industry, government, and researchers as a demographic who can benefit significantly from the use of intelligent assistive technology to support various activities of daily living. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this scoping review is to summarize the literature on the importance of the concept of ""trust"" in the adoption of intelligent assistive technologies to assist aging in place by older adults. METHODS Using a scoping review methodology, our search strategy will examine the following databases: ACM Digital Library, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. Two reviewers will independently screen the initial titles obtained from the search, and these results will be further inspected by other members of the research team for inclusion in the review. RESULTS This review will provide insights into how the concept of trust is actualized in the adoption of intelligent assistive technology by older adults. Preliminary sensitization to the literature suggests that the concept of trust is fluid, unstable, and intimately tied to the type of intelligent assistive technology being examined. Furthermore, a wide range of theoretical lenses that include elements of trust have been used to examine this concept. CONCLUSIONS This review will describe the concept of trust in the adoption of intelligent assistive technology by older adults, and will provide insights for practitioners, policy makers, and technology vendors for future practice.","McMurray, Josephine; Strudwick, Gillian; Forchuk, Cheryl; Morse, Adam; Lachance, Jessica; Baskaran, Arani; Allison, Lauren; Booth, Richard",JMIR research protocols,579,10

The primary immunisation consists of 4 separate 0.5 ml doses of Fendrix®, administered at the following schedule: 1 month, 2 months and 6 months from the date of the first dose. Once the positivity was reached in any of the doses, the participant finished the study and was not given the following doses. 68.66% (46 out 67) had a positive response to first dose of Fendrix®. 57.14% (12 out 21) had a positive response to second dose of Fendrix®. 22.22% (2 out 9) had a positive response to third dose of Fendrix and 42.96% (3 out 7) had a positive response to last dose of Fendrix®. Overall, 94.02% (64 out 67) of participants had a positive response to Fendrix®. No serious adverse event occurred. CONCLUSIONS The use of Fendrix®, is a viable vaccine alternative for NHS workers classified as ""non-responders"". Revaccination of healthy non-responders with Fendrix®, resulted in very high proportions of responders without adverse events.

Patients were included from a longitudinal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging study of minor stroke/transient ischemic attack patients. Images were co-registered and new WMH at 18 months were identified by comparing follow-up imaging with baseline fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). Regions-of-interest (ROIs) were placed on FLAIR images in one of three categories: (1) WMH seen at both baseline and follow-up imaging, (2) new WMH seen only on follow-up imaging, and (3) regions of normal-appearing white matter at both time points. Registered CBF maps at baseline were used to measure CBF in the ROIs. A multivariable model was developed using mixed-effects logistic regression to determine the effect of baseline CBF on the development on new WMH. Forty patients were included. Mean age was 61±11 years, 30% were female. Low baseline CBF, female sex, and presence of diabetes were independently associated with the presence of new WMH on follow-up imaging. The odds of having new WMH on follow-up imaging reduces by 0.61 (95% confidence interval=0.57 to 0.65) for each 1 mL/100 g per minute increase in baseline CBF. We conclude that regions of white matter with low CBF develop new WMH on follow-up imaging.","Bernbaum, Manya; Menon, Bijoy K; Fick, Gordon; Smith, Eric E; Goyal, Mayank; Frayne, Richard; Coutts, Shelagh B",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,579,1

The present study is a retrospective analysis of these post-COVID-19 patients presenting to one of the units of Viswanathan Chest Hospital, Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, University of Delhi, Delhi in the period from 17 June 2020 to 22 October 2020. We analysed the demographic profile, history, functional assessment and all investigations of this study cohort. Out of the 2,165 patients provided consultation, there were 35 patients of post-COVID-19, which were included in the present study. These patients had a mean duration of 47 days from discharge to first visit to our hospital. Pre-existing respiratory comorbidity was present in 63%. History of hospitalisation was present in 52%. Fatigue (65%) was the most common symptom followed by breathlessness (60%), cough (45.71%) and chest pain (28.57%). Three patients had significant desaturation on 6-minute walk test and one patient had type 2 respiratory failure on presentation. Chest X-ray was abnormal in 34.28% (n=12). On CT thorax (n=17) the most common finding was diffuse reticulations (52.94%) followed by diffuse ground glass opacities (GGOs) (35.29%). One patient each were newly diagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis and tubercular unilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Conclusively, post-COVID-19 patients may have remnant symptoms like fatigue, breathlessness and cough. Also, patients with pre-existing respiratory diseases are more symptomatic and even may suffer from deterioration in the clinical course. Further we need to be alert of alternate diagnosis or infections like tuberculosis (TB) in these patients, especially in TB endemic countries like India. Simultaneously, the use of immunosuppressant drugs like steroids for COVID-19 management, predisposes to TB. A proper evaluation with holistic and standardised management plan is the need of the hour for post-COVID-19 patients, until its time course, evolution and manifestations are unravelled.","Goel, Nitin; Goyal, Nitesh; Kumar, Raj",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,579,1

TCP inhibits secretion of sex hormones. Similar to CPF, TCP can bind to sex steroid hormone receptors and decrease the secretion of sex hormones. However, little attention has been paid to the ability of TCP and CPF to interfere with androgen receptor (AR) in Sertoli cells. This study aimed to explain how TCP promotes the inhibitory effect of CPF on the paracrine function of Sertoli cells. Western blotting indicated that after 20 weeks of exposure, expression of AR in testes was significantly reduced by CPF. An in vitro assay measured the cytotoxicity of CPF, TCP and diethylphosphate (DEP) on viability of Sertoli cells by Cell Counting Kit-8. CPF cytotoxicity was greater than that of TCP, and TCP cytotoxicity was greater than that of DEP at concentrations of 1000 μmol/L. Western blotting indicated that TCP and CPF both decreased expression of AR and cAMP-response element binding protein phosphorylation, while DEP had no effect in Sertoli cells, which are important in regulating paracrine function of Sertoli cells. The fluorescence measurements and docking studies revealed that testosterone, CPF and TCP showed four types of intermolecular interactions with AR, highlighting alkyl bonds with some of the same amino acids. Compared with testosterone, CPF and TCP also showed significant synergistic interaction with AR. CPF interacted with more amino acids and interaction energy than TCP did. This research elucidates TCP in the antiandrogenic effect of CPF on the paracrine function and suggests that TCP or chemicals with a trichloropyridine structure must be considered during reproductive toxicity assessment of potential environmental pollutants.","Gao, Haina; Li, Jinwang; Zhao, Guoping; Li, Yixuan",Toxicology,579,29

These include greater interest in viral respiratory infections (partially stimulated by the recent influenza A pandemic), improved characterisation of who is at risk of community-acquired pneumonia and mycobacterial infection, research into better diagnostics and attempts to develop new or improved scoring scales for a range of respiratory infection syndromes. There have also been a limited number of articles on how to manage patients with respiratory infection, including describing the efficacy of prevention by vaccination. Overall, there has been a discernible emphasis on transferring advances in clinical science to actual clinical practice, with several papers using molecular methodologies or measuring levels of cytokines or other potential biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with lung infection. There have also been manuscripts linking specific pathogen genotypes to infection phenotype, an area that is likely to be increasingly important in explaining some of the variations in severity between patients with respiratory infection.

However, the role of bariatric surgery is not well understood in this subgroup. METHODS A total of 2244 morbid obese individuals aged 18-65 years undergoing bariatric surgery were selected. Patients were considered MHMO according to the joint interim statement (JIS) definition, as having two or less abnormalities in these five parameters: waist circumference (WC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), systolic or diastolic blood pressure (SBP or DBP), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Otherwise, they were considered metabolically unhealthy morbid obese (MUMO). Follow-up data were collected at 6, 12, and 24 months post-surgery. RESULTS Prior to surgery, 36.2% of participants were MHMO and had significantly lower BMI, WC, TG, FPG, SBP, and DBP and higher HDL-C compared to MUMO. Both MHMO and MUMO participants showed a significant decrease in BMI, WC, TG, SBP, DBP, and FPG and increase in HDL-C and the percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL). Two-year post-operative changes (from baseline) of BMI, WC, and %EWL were greater in MHMO subjects and changes of TG, HDL-C, DBP, SBP, and FPG were greater in MUMO subjects. Further multivariate regression analysis for delta (∆) change in these characteristics revealed that only the delta (∆) changes of WC and %EWL were statistically different between the two phenotypes and were greater in MHMO subjects, 2 years after the surgery (- 3.077 cm decrease in WC and + 3.612% higher %EWL compared to MUMO subjects). CONCLUSION Bariatric surgery is an effective method for reduction of metabolic abnormalities and weight loss in both MUMO and MHMO phenotypes. Benefits of this intervention are comparable between patients with these two obesity phenotypes.","Barzin, Maryam; Aryannezhad, Shayan; Khalaj, Alireza; Mahdavi, Maryam; Valizadeh, Majid; Ghareh, Sahar; Azizi, Feridoun; Hosseinpanah, Farhad",Obesity surgery,579,0

Moreover, we aimed to explore whether they integrate recommended features for the use of mobile technologies in healthcare and recognized parameters for optimal conservative UI treatment. METHODS We conducted a literature search on Medline, Embase, CINAHL, REHABDATA, Cochrane Library and PEDro databases. Eligible articles included people with UI of any type and use of a mobile technology for the conservative self-management of UI. Two reviewers independently screened, reviewed, and extracted data on study design, type of mobile technologies, valuable features, and outcomes related to UI. RESULTS Twelve articles (level of evidence II to V) were retained. Technologies used were a mobile app alone (n = 2), a Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT) device and app (n = 2), a PFMT device and telerehabilitation (n = 1), a smartphone messaging system (n = 1), and an internet-based program (n = 1). PFMT programs prescribed a daily frequency for at least 8 weeks. Between 1 and 4 valuable features were reported out of 6 identified. After intervention, at least 1 outcome on UI severity was reported improved in 6/7 studies, satisfaction was high in 3/3 studies and adherence was high (daily usage) in 4/5 studies. CONCLUSION There is level 2 evidence that there are benefits of using mobile technologies in terms of improvements in UI, satisfaction, adherence, and costs. Mobile technologies reviewed seem to follow optimal PFMT parameters, but users could benefit further from more built-in features that may optimize rehabilitation outcomes.","Bernard, Stéphanie; Boucher, Sabrina; McLean, Linda; Moffet, Hélène",International urogynecology journal,579,16

Patients and Methods Investigators from six centers performed RFA for hepatic hemangioma and used a standardized follow-up protocol. Data were collected from 291 patients, including 253 patients with hepatic hemangioma 5 to 9.9 cm in diameter (group A) and 38 with hepatic hemangioma ≥ 10 cm (group B). Technical success, complete ablation, and complications attributed to the RFA procedure were reported. Analysis of variance was used to determine whether the major complication rate was related to tumor size or clinical experience. Results A total of 304 lesions were treated in 291 patients. Technical success was achieved without adverse events in all cases. A total of 301 lesions were completely ablated, including 265 of 265 (100%) lesions in group A, and 36 of 39 (92.31%) in group B. The rate of technology-related complications was similar in groups A and B (5.14% (13/253) and 13.16% (5/38), respectively; P = 0.121). Moreover, all technology-related complications occurred during the early learning curve period. The rate of hemolysis-related complications in two groups were 83.40% (211/253) and 100% (38/38) (P =0.007) and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome-related complications in two groups were 33.99% (86/253) and 86.84% (33/38) (P<0.001). There were no delayed complications in either group. Conclusion RFA is minimally invasive, safe, and effective for hepatic hemangiomas 5 to 9.9 cm in diameter. More clinical data are needed to confirm the safety of RFA for hepatic hemangiomas ≥ 10 cm.","Wu, Shilun; Gao, Ruize; Yin, Tao; Zhu, Ruhang; Guo, Shigang; Xin, Zonghai; Li, Aolei; Kong, Xinliang; Gao, Jun; Sun, Wenbing",Frontiers in oncology,579,1

The aim of this study was to determine the relationships between oxygenator exhaust and blood concentrations of isoflurane and the BIS score during CPB when administering isoflurane into the sweep gas supply to the oxygenator. METHODS Seventeen patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery using CPB and isoflurane with BIS monitoring were recruited in a single-centre university hospital. Isoflurane gas was delivered via a calibrated vaporiser at the beginning of anaesthetic induction. Radial arterial blood samples were collected after the initiation of CPB and before aortic cross-clamping, which were analysed for isoflurane by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The BIS score and the concentration of exhausted isoflurane from the oxygenator membrane, as measured by an anaesthetic gas analyser, were recorded at the time of blood sampling. RESULTS The mean duration of anaesthetic induction to arterial blood sampling was 90 min (95%CI: 80,100). On CPB, the median BIS was 39 (range, 7-43) and the mean oxygenator exhaust isoflurane concentration was 1.24 ± 0.21%. No significant correlation was demonstrated between BIS with arterial isoflurane concentration (r=-0.19, p=0.47) or oxygenator exhaust isoflurane concentration (r=0.07, p=0.80). Mixed-venous blood temperature was moderately correlated to BIS (r=0.50, p=0.04). Oxygenator exhaust isoflurane concentration was moderately, positively correlated with its arterial concentration (r=0.64, p<0.01). DISCUSSION In conclusion, in patients undergoing heart surgery with CPB, the findings of this study indicate that, whilst oxygenator exhaust concentrations were significantly associated with arterial concentrations of isoflurane, neither had any association with the BIS scores, whereas body temperature has moderate positive correlation.","Ng, Ka Ting; Alston, R Peter; Just, George; McKenzie, Chris",Perfusion,579,31

We examined the results regarding simulated VRS and provided an overview of how the current results may be employed in VRS training. Lastly, we evaluated the quality of these results. METHODS The databases of Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for articles in English involving simulated VRS training. A qualitative analysis was performed, since the studies which met our inclusion criteria did not allow for a quantitative meta-analysis. RESULTS We identified 203 articles of which seven met the inclusion criteria. Of these, six studies investigated simulation with EyeSi® Surgical (VRMagic, Mannheim, Germany). Six studies reported positive performance curves. Four studies showed construct validity. One study attempted to show skill transfer from simulator to vitrectomies performed on cadavers. Methodological quality of the included studies was moderate but lacking in instrument validation. CONCLUSION Simulator-based training in VRS can assess and possibly assist acquisition of a variety of VRS skills. Further research is needed to support transfer from simulator to operating room. Future studies should strive to follow established validation frameworks and streamline study designs.","Rasmussen, Rasmus Christian; Grauslund, Jakob; Vergmann, Anna Stage",BMC ophthalmology,579,1

The sitting position is known to cause physiological changes related to cardiovascular adaptation. Interscalene nerve blocks (ISB) are the most commonly used techniques and are considered gold standard regional anesthesia methods for shoulder surgeries. Cerebral vessels located around sympathetic ganglia provide sympathetic system integrity. This local anesthetic spreading during ISB could be a side effect or provide a protective effect on cerebral ischemia. Our study aimed to investigate the cerebral protective effect of the ISB in arthroscopic shoulder surgeries in a sitting position. Material and methods After the approval of Koç University Clinical Research Ethics Committee (2020.020.IRB1.011), records of patients between January and December 2019 with shoulder arthroscopy at the Vehbi Koç Foundation (VKV) American hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Records of the hemodynamic response, INVOSTM (Medtronic, Minneapolis, USA) (rSO2) parameters, pain scores, and additional analgesic needs of all cases were examined in the intraoperative and postoperative period. Results Data of 40 patients who met the criteria to be included in the study was analyzed. Our study showed that the sitting position leading to hypotension coincided with a decrease in INVOS values. Nevertheless, we did not record any significant hypotension after ISB, and this may be due to the use of a minimal dose of local anesthetic. There was a certain increase in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) values ​​after ISB. We saw that the value of regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) increased on both the ISB side and the non-ISB side. This shows that the ISB can have a global impact on the brain. Specificially, the increase in rSO2 values ​​in the ISB side compared to the other side suggests that ISB has possible positive effects on cerebral blood flow. Conclusion Our study has shown that ISB may transiently increase the rSO2 levels in the sitting position during shoulder surgery.","Coşarcan, Sami Kaan; Gurkan, Yavuz; Doğan, Alper Tunga; Koyuncu, Özgür; Erçelen, Ömür",Cureus,579,16

SETTING Tertiary care medical center. PATIENTS Four hundred ten patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. DESIGN Prospective observational study. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Autoregulation was monitored during cardiopulmonary bypass by calculating a continuous, moving Pearson's correlation coefficient between mean arterial blood pressure and processed near-infrared spectroscopy signals to generate the variable cerebral oximetry index. When mean arterial blood pressure is below the lower limit of autoregulation, cerebral oximetry index approaches 1, because cerebral blood flow is pressure passive. An identifiable lower limit of autoregulation was ascertained in 348 patients. Based on the RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, End-stage renal disease), acute kidney injury developed within 7 days of surgery in 121 (34.8%) of these patients. Although the average mean arterial blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass did not differ, the mean arterial blood pressure at the limit of autoregulation and the duration and degree to which mean arterial blood pressure was below the autoregulation threshold (mm Hg × min/hr of cardiopulmonary bypass) were both higher in patients with acute kidney injury than in those without acute kidney injury. Excursions of mean arterial blood pressure below the lower limit of autoregulation (relative risk 1.02; 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.03; p < 0.0001) and diabetes (relative risk 1.78; 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 2.50; p = 0.001) were independently associated with for acute kidney injury. CONCLUSIONS Excursions of mean arterial blood pressure below the limit of autoregulation and not absolute mean arterial blood pressure are independently associated with for acute kidney injury.

The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of intracanal cryotherapy on postoperative pain after root canal therapy in patients with pulpal or peri-radicular pathosis. METHODS We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library as well as the top three endodontic journals for relevant papers. We included randomized controlled trials that included adults. Our main outcome was postoperative pain intensity measured with a validated scale. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane criteria and the quality of the included studies using GRADE. We used a random-effects model for meta-analysis. RESULTS Eight studies involving 810 patients were included. The overall risk of bias was moderate. Seven of eight studies used a visual analog scale to measure pain intensity. Compared with controls, intracanal cryotherapy significantly reduced postoperative pain at 6 (mean difference [MD] -1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.61 to -2.14; P < 0.05; I2 = 76%; moderate quality evidence) and 24 hours after the procedure (MD -1.43; 95% CI -0.70 to -2.15; P < 0.05; I2 = 89%; moderate quality evidence). There was no significant effect on pain at 48 and 72 hours and 7 days after the procedure.

In addition to primary bariatric operations, data regarding the complications of revision procedures and redo operations have been analyzed. Participation in the quality assurance study is required for all certified centers in Germany. RESULTS SGs are a popular redo operation after failed gastric banding. Using the German Bariatric Surgery Registry, we analyzed data from 137 SGs that were used in a one-step approach after GB and 37 SGs that were used in a two-step approach. Leakage rates for primary SGs dropped to 1.9 %. The incidence of leakage after a one-step SG after GB is significantly higher (4.4 %) than for a two-step approach (0 %).

Consistent with an extrafollicular B cell response, patients with severe COVID-19 have elevated frequencies of clonally expanded, class-switched, unmutated plasmablasts. However, it is unclear whether B cell populations in individuals with mild COVID-19 are similarly skewed. In this study, we use single-cell RNA sequencing of B cells to show that in contrast to patients with severe COVID-19, subjects with mildly symptomatic COVID-19 have B cell repertoires enriched for clonally diverse, somatically hypermutated memory B cells ∼30 d after the onset of symptoms.

NoV is nonenveloped, with a single-stranded RNA genome, and is primarily transmitted person to person. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is critical for the production of genomic and subgenomic RNA and is therefore a prime target for antiviral therapies. Using high-throughput screening, nearly 20,000 ""lead-like"" compounds were tested for inhibitory activity against the NoV genogroup II, genotype 4 (GII.4) RdRp. The four most potent hits demonstrated half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) between 5.0 μM and 9.8 μM against the target RdRp. Compounds NIC02 and NIC04 revealed a mixed mode of inhibition, while NIC10 and NIC12 were uncompetitive RdRp inhibitors. When examined using enzymes from related viruses, NIC02 demonstrated broad inhibitory activity while NIC04 was the most specific GII.4 RdRp inhibitor. The antiviral activity was examined using available NoV cell culture models; the GI.1 replicon and the infectious GV.1 murine norovirus (MNV). NIC02 and NIC04 inhibited the replication of the GI.1 replicon, with 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) of 30.1 μM and 71.1 μM, respectively, while NIC10 and NIC12 had no observable effect on the NoV GI.1 replicon. In the MNV model, NIC02 reduced plaque numbers, size, and viral RNA levels in a dose-dependent manner (EC50s between 2.3 μM and 4.8 μM). The remaining three compounds also reduced MNV replication, although with higher EC50s, ranging from 32 μM to 38 μM.

The function of HKU1-HE remains largely undetermined. In this study, we examined binding of the S1 domain of hCoV-HKU1 spike to a panel of cells and found that the S1 could specifically bind on the cell surface of a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, RD. Pretreatment of RD cells with neuraminidase (NA) and trypsin greatly reduced the binding, suggesting that the binding was mediated by sialic acids on glycoproteins. However, unlike other group 2a CoVs, e.g., hCoV-OC43, for which 9-O-acetylated sialic acid (9-O-Ac-Sia) serves as a receptor determinant, HKU1-S1 bound with neither 9-O-Ac-Sia-containing glycoprotein(s) nor rat and mouse erythrocytes. Nonetheless, the HKU1-HE was similar to OC43-HE, also possessed sialate-O-acetylesterase activity, and acted as a receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) capable of eliminating the binding of HKU1-S1 to RD cells, whereas the O-acetylesterase-inactive HKU1-HE mutant lost this capacity. Using primary human ciliated airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures, the only in vitro replication model for hCoV-HKU1 infection, we confirmed that pretreatment of HAE cells with HE but not the enzymatically inactive mutant blocked hCoV-HKU1 infection. These results demonstrate that hCoV-HKU1 exploits O-Ac-Sia as a cellular attachment receptor determinant to initiate the infection of host cells and that its HE protein possesses the corresponding sialate-O-acetylesterase RDE activity. IMPORTANCE Human coronaviruses (hCoV) are important human respiratory pathogens. Among the six hCoVs identified to date, only hCoV-HKU1 has no defined cellular receptor. It is also unclear whether hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein plays a role in viral entry. In this study, we found that, similarly to other members of the group 2a CoVs, sialic acid moieties on glycoproteins are critical receptor determinants for the hCoV-HKU1 infection. Interestingly, the virus seems to employ a type of sialic acid different from those employed by other group 2a CoVs. In addition, we determined that the HKU1-HE protein is an O-acetylesterase and acts as a receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) for hCoV-HKU1. This is the first study to demonstrate that hCoV-HKU1 uses certain types of O-acetylated sialic acid residues on glycoproteins to initiate the infection of host cells and that the HKU1-HE protein possesses sialate-O-acetylesterase RDE activity.","Huang, Xingchuan; Dong, Wenjuan; Milewska, Aleksandra; Golda, Anna; Qi, Yonghe; Zhu, Quan K; Marasco, Wayne A; Baric, Ralph S; Sims, Amy C; Pyrc, Krzysztof; Li, Wenhui; Sui, Jianhua",Journal of virology,579,1

Poor immunogenicity of H7N9 haemagglutinin (HA) is a major obstacle to the development of an effective H7N9 vaccine. Here, we found that the vaccine containing the H7HA head conjugated with IgG Fc (Hd-Fc) induced strong neutralizing antibody responses and protection against H7N9 infection, whilst the Fc-conjugated H7HA stalk (St-Fc)-based vaccine could not induce neutralizing antibodies, although the St-Fc-immunized mice were partially protected. The vaccines containing the full-length extracellular domain of HA conjugated with Fc and the mixture of Hd-Fc plus St-Fc induced significantly lower neutralizing antibody and haemagglutination inhibition titres than the Hd-Fc-based vaccine. These results suggest that the St-Fc may have inhibitory effects on the neutralizing immunogenicity of Hd-Fc. Therefore, the neutralizing domain(s), such as the receptor-binding domain, in the HA head should be kept and the non-neutralizing domain(s) in the HA stalk with the ability to potentially suppress the neutralizing immunogenicity of HA head should be removed from Fc-conjugated HA-based influenza vaccines to increase the neutralizing antibody response.","He, B; Xia, S; Yu, F; Fu, Y; Li, W; Wang, Q; Lu, L; Jiang, S",The Journal of general virology,579,1

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to investigate the anxiety and depression and general effect of COVID-19 pandemic on AR patients' psychological status in Wuhan, China. METHODS In October 2019, 222 outpatients suffering from AR in our department and 133 healthy controls were enrolled. All participants were asked to finish the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) questionnaire. The demographic characteristics and the severity of AR symptoms were recorded. In April 2020, the AR patients and healthy controls were re-contacted to finish the questionnaires by telephone or online. The SAS and SDS scores in AR patients and healthy controls and the correlation with other variables were analyzed. RESULTS For AR patients, the SAS and SDS scores were significantly higher than healthy controls. Meanwhile, the rates of anxiety and depression were 24.8% and 19.4% respectively. The education level and symptoms severity were correlated with SAS and SDS scores. Ninety-eight AR patients and 56 healthy controls finished the questionnaires after COVID-19 pandemic. The AR patients' SAS and SDS scores were lower than before COVID-19 pandemic and were correlated with AR symptom scores. The scores of healthy controls were not different with before COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The occurrence of anxiety and depression is common in AR patients. Severity of symptoms and low education level are the risk factors causing anxiety and depression. COVID-19 pandemic has no significant negative impact on the AR patients' psychological status.","Wang, Yin; Shi, Cancan; Yang, Yaqi; Zhang, Si; Li, Wenjing; Huang, Nan; Zhu, Rongfei",Asian Pacific journal of allergy and immunology,579,16

Previously, we reported that each of the 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB proteins of Aichi virus (AiV), a picornavirus, forms a complex with the Golgi apparatus protein ACBD3 and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KB) at viral RNA replication sites (replication organelles [ROs]), enhancing PI4KB-dependent phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) production. Here, we demonstrate AiV hijacking of the cellular cholesterol transport system involving oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP), a PI4P-binding cholesterol transfer protein. AiV RNA replication was inhibited by silencing cellular proteins known to be components of this pathway, OSBP, the ER membrane proteins VAPA and VAPB (VAP-A/B), the PI4P-phosphatase SAC1, and PI-transfer protein β. OSBP, VAP-A/B, and SAC1 were present at RNA replication sites. We also found various previously unknown interactions among the AiV proteins (2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB), ACBD3, OSBP, VAP-A/B, and SAC1, and the interactions were suggested to be involved in recruiting the component proteins to AiV ROs. Importantly, the OSBP-2B interaction enabled PI4P-independent recruitment of OSBP to AiV ROs, indicating preferential recruitment of OSBP among PI4P-binding proteins. Protein-protein interaction-based OSBP recruitment has not been reported for other picornaviruses. Cholesterol was accumulated at AiV ROs, and inhibition of OSBP-mediated cholesterol transfer impaired cholesterol accumulation and AiV RNA replication. Electron microscopy showed that AiV-induced vesicle-like structures were close to ER membranes. Altogether, we conclude that AiV directly recruits the cholesterol transport machinery through protein-protein interactions, resulting in formation of membrane contact sites between the ER and AiV ROs and cholesterol supply to the ROs.IMPORTANCE Positive-strand RNA viruses utilize host pathways to modulate the lipid composition of viral RNA replication sites for replication. Previously, we demonstrated that Aichi virus (AiV), a picornavirus, forms a complex comprising certain proteins of AiV, the Golgi apparatus protein ACBD3, and the lipid kinase PI4KB to synthesize PI4P lipid at the sites for AiV RNA replication. Here, we confirmed cholesterol accumulation at the AiV RNA replication sites, which are established by hijacking the host cholesterol transfer machinery mediated by a PI4P-binding cholesterol transfer protein, OSBP. We showed that the component proteins of the machinery, OSBP, VAP, SAC1, and PITPNB, are all essential host factors for AiV replication. Importantly, the machinery is directly recruited to the RNA replication sites through previously unknown interactions of VAP/OSBP/SAC1 with the AiV proteins and with ACBD3. Consequently, we propose a specific strategy employed by AiV to efficiently accumulate cholesterol at the RNA replication sites via protein-protein interactions.","Ishikawa-Sasaki, Kumiko; Nagashima, Shigeo; Taniguchi, Koki; Sasaki, Jun",Journal of virology,579,1

The M carboxy-terminal endodomain contains a conserved domain (CD) following the third transmembrane (TM) domain. The importance of the CD (SWWSFNPETNNL) in mouse hepatitis virus was investigated with a panel of mutant proteins, using genetic analysis and transient-expression assays. A charge reversal for negatively charged E(121) was not tolerated. Lysine (K) and arginine (R) substitutions were replaced in recovered viruses by neutrally charged glutamine (Q) and leucine (L), respectively, after only one passage. E121Q and E121L M proteins were capable of forming virus-like particles (VLPs) when coexpressed with E, whereas E121R and E121K proteins were not. Alanine substitutions for the first four or the last four residues resulted in viruses with significantly crippled phenotypes and proteins that failed to assemble VLPs or to be rescued into the envelope. All recovered viruses with alanine substitutions in place of SWWS residues had second-site, partially compensating, changes in the first TM of M. Alanine substitution for proline had little impact on the virus. N protein coexpression with some M mutants increased VLP production. The results overall suggest that the CD is important for formation of the viral envelope by helping mediate fundamental M-M interactions and that the presence of the N protein may help stabilize M complexes during virus assembly.","Arndt, Ariel L; Larson, Blake J; Hogue, Brenda G",Journal of virology,579,12

To increase detection sensitivity and response dynamics, we genetically engineered firefly luciferase to detect specific intermolecular interactions through modulation of its luminescence activity. This concept has been applied in covalent, noncovalent, and allosteric design configurations. The covalent design gives sensitive detection of protease activity through a cleavage-dependent increase in luminescence. The noncovalent and allosteric designs allow reversible detection of the small molecules rapamycin and cAMP, respectively. These sensors allow detection of molecular processes within living cells following addition of the luciferin substrate to the growth medium. For example, the cAMP sensor allows monitoring of intracellular signal transduction associated with G-protein coupled receptor function. These and other luminescent biosensors will be useful for the sensitive detection of cellular physiology in research and drug discovery.","Fan, Frank; Binkowski, Brock F; Butler, Braeden L; Stecha, Peter F; Lewis, Martin K; Wood, Keith V",ACS chemical biology,579,30

Psychological distress is considered a reliable proxy for psychopathology and can be negatively influenced by childhood trauma through sensitization effects. Emotion dysregulation has been proposed as a potential mediator of this mechanism. We aimed to test this hypothesis in a national Italian sample assessed in the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. METHODS We investigated the relationship between psychological distress and childhood trauma in 500 healthy participants assessed through a survey-based study, after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic lockdown in Italy. Levels of psychological distress and history of childhood trauma were obtained using the Kessler-10 (K10) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, respectively. We used bootstrapped mediation analysis to test the mediator role of emotional dysregulation, measured through the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, on the effect of childhood trauma on psychological distress. RESULTS In total, 190 (38%) reported psychological distress related to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Individuals with psychological distress experienced more childhood trauma, specifically emotional abuse (F = 23.51, df = 1, p < 0.001) and neglect (F = 10.98, df = 1, p = 0.001). After modelling the effect of emotional dysregulation, the impact of childhood trauma on coronavirus disease 2019-related psychological distress resulted in indirect effects and mediated by deficits in emotion regulation mechanisms (bootstrapped lower level of confidence interval = 0.345, upper level of confidence interval = 0.598). CONCLUSION Childhood trauma is associated with increased vulnerability to the stressful effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Our data suggest that emotional dysregulation may represent a dimension mediating the impact of childhood trauma on coronavirus disease 2019-related psychological distress and may be considered as specific target for interventions aiming at empowering resilience.","Janiri, Delfina; Moccia, Lorenzo; Dattoli, Luigi; Pepe, Maria; Molinaro, Marzia; De Martin, Valentina; Chieffo, Daniela; Di Nicola, Marco; Fiorillo, Andrea; Janiri, Luigi; Sani, Gabriele",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,579,1

Large cohort studies can provide further understanding into inter-individual differences, with more precise characterization of the pathways by which the gut microbiota influences human physiology and disease processes. Here, we aimed to profile the stool microbiome of children and adults from two population-based cohort studies, comprising 2,111 children in the age-range of 9 to 12 years (the Generation R Study) and 1,427 adult individuals in the range of 46 to 88 years of age (the Rotterdam Study). For the two cohorts, 16S rRNA gene profile datasets derived from the Dutch population were generated. The comparison of the two cohorts showed that children had significantly lower gut microbiome diversity. Furthermore, we observed higher relative abundances of genus Bacteroides in children and higher relative abundances of genus Blautia in adults. Predicted functional metagenome analysis showed an overrepresentation of the glycan degradation pathways, riboflavin (vitamin B2), pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis pathways in children. In contrast, the gut microbiome of adults showed higher abundances of carbohydrate metabolism pathways, beta-lactam resistance, thiamine (vitamin B1) and pantothenic (vitamin B5) biosynthesis pathways. A predominance of catabolic pathways in children (valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation) as compared to biosynthetic pathways in adults (valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis) suggests a functional microbiome switch to the latter in adult individuals. Overall, we identified compositional and functional differences in gut microbiome between children and adults in a population-based setting. These microbiome profiles can serve as reference for future studies on specific human disease susceptibility in childhood, adulthood and specific diseased populations.","Radjabzadeh, Djawad; Boer, Cindy G; Beth, Sanne A; van der Wal, Pelle; Kiefte-De Jong, Jessica C; Jansen, Michelle A E; Konstantinov, Sergey R; Peppelenbosch, Maikel P; Hays, John P; Jaddoe, Vincent W V; Ikram, M Arfan; Rivadeneira, Fernando; van Meurs, Joyce B J; Uitterlinden, André G; Medina-Gomez, Carolina; Moll, Henriette A; Kraaij, Robert",Scientific reports,579,1

Using surveillance data from the BioFire Syndromic Trends epidemiology network in the United States from January 2014 to September 2019, we characterized the epidemiological dynamics of EV-D68 and found latitudinal gradient in the mean timing of EV-D68 cases, which are likely climate driven. We also demonstrated a strong spatiotemporal association of EV-D68 with AFM. Mathematical modeling suggested that the recent dominant biennial cycles of EV-D68 dynamics may not be stable. Nonetheless, we predicted that a major EV-D68 outbreak, and hence an AFM outbreak, would have still been possible in 2020 under normal epidemiological conditions. Nonpharmaceutical intervention efforts due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are likely to have reduced the sizes of EV-D68 and AFM outbreaks in 2020, illustrating the broader epidemiological impact of the pandemic.","Park, Sang Woo; Pons-Salort, Margarita; Messacar, Kevin; Cook, Camille; Meyers, Lindsay; Farrar, Jeremy; Grenfell, Bryan T",Science translational medicine,579,1

All systematic reviews included after exclusions were independently reviewed to determine whether clinical trials registries had been included as part of the search process. Studies that reported using a trials registry were further examined to determine whether trial data were included in the analysis of these systematic reviews. RESULTS Our initial search resulted in 292 articles, which was narrowed to 256 after exclusions.

Here, we attempted to resolve this discrepancy by applying more realistic evolutionary models that have previously revealed the ancient evolutionary history of other RNA viruses.

The objective of this paper is to detail an approach to investigate bupropion's efficacy for preventing postpartum smoking relapse among women who quit smoking during pregnancy. Specifically, we designed a two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial testing the efficacy of bupropion vs. placebo as a relapse prevention tool. Mothers of healthy infants who quit smoking while pregnant will be stratified based on current or past history of major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder and randomized to receive either active (bupropion XL 300 mg/day) or placebo medication for 12 weeks.

METHODS Observational population-based study with longitudinal follow-up in patients with COPD identified in a primary care electronic medical records database in Catalonia, covering 80% of the general population. The aims were to characterize COPD patients who initiated TT and to describe treatment pathways before and after TT initiation. Time to and probability of step down or complete discontinuation of TT was described using restricted mean survival time and Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS A total of 34,018 COPD patients initiated TT during the study period. Of them, 23,867 (70.1%) were GOLD A/B. 18,453 (54.2%) were non-exacerbators, 9931 (29.2%) infrequent exacerbators, 5634 (16.5%) frequent exacerbators and 1923 (5.6%) had asthma-COPD overlap. Drugs most frequently used prior to initiation of TT were long-acting antimuscarinics (22.5%) and combination of long-acting beta2 agonists/inhaled corticosteroids (15.2%). A total of 11,666 (34.3%) stepped down and 1091 (3.2%) discontinued TT during follow-up. Step down following TT was more likely in patients with severe COPD, especially during the first year; however, discontinuation was more common among patients with mild COPD. CONCLUSION Most patients initiating treatment with TT were non exacerbators and continued on the same treatment over time regardless severity of disease. Stepping down was more frequent in severe patients, while discontinuation was more common among mild patients. Overall, it appears that TT is extensively used in primary care for treatment of patients with COPD.","Monteagudo, Mònica; Nuñez, Alexa; Solntseva, Iryna; Dhalwani, Nafeesa; Booth, Alison; Barrecheguren, Miriam; Lambrelli, Dimitra; Miravitlles, Marc",Archivos de bronconeumologia,579,1

Nevertheless, little has been published on the factors differentiating MIS-C from other conditions in the acute care setting. We investigated differences in presentation and laboratory studies between suspected versus confirmed MIS-C patients. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study on patients 21 years or younger undergoing investigation for possible MIS-C at a single institution between April 21 and July 1, 2020. The primary outcome was diagnosis of MIS-C or an alternative final diagnosis. Clinical features and laboratory findings from initial presentation were collected and analyzed. RESULTS A total of 106 patients (median, 4 years; 55.7% male) were included, of whom 17 (16%) of 106 met the criteria for MIS-C. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children patients were significantly more likely to report a coronavirus disease 2019 exposure (odds ratio (OR), 13.17 [3.87-44.9]), have gastrointestinal symptoms (OR, 3.81 [1.02-14.19]), and have a significantly higher odds of having abnormal laboratory values including high-sensitivity troponin T (OR, 13 [4.0-42.2]), N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (OR, 8.4 [2.3-30.1]), D-dimer (OR, 13 [1.6-103]), and ferritin (OR, 7.8 [2.2-27.2]). There were also differences between groups in inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (median, 134.45 mg/L vs 12.6 mg/L; P < 0.05) and procalcitonin (1.71 ng/mL vs 0.14 ng/mL; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Higher elevations in key laboratory studies may help to distinguish between MIS-C patients and non-MIS-C patients presenting to the emergency department.","Kelly, Michael S; Fernandes, Neil D; Carr, Audrey V; Lahoud-Rahme, Manuella; Cummings, Brian M; Chiu, Joanne S",Pediatric emergency care,579,16

However, the lipophilicity of the first generation Tc(CO)(3)-dipyridyl complexes has resulted in substantial hepatobiliary uptake when either examined as lysine derivatives or integrated into biologically active small molecules and peptides. Here we designed, synthesized, and evaluated novel SAAC systems that have been chemically modified to promote overall Tc(CO)(3)L(3) complex hydrophilicity with the intent of enhancing renal clearance. A series of lysine derived SAAC systems containing functionalized polar imidazole rings and/or carboxylic acids were synthesized via reductive alkylation of the epsilon amino group of lysine. The SAAC systems were radiolabeled with (99m)Tc, purified, and evaluated for radiochemical stability, lipophilicity, and tissue distribution in rats. The log P values of the (99m)Tc complexes were determined experimentally and ranged from -0.91 to -2.33. The resulting complexes were stable (>90%) for at least 24 h. Tissue distribution in normal rats of the lead (99m)Tc complexes demonstrated decreased liver (<1 %ID/g) and gastrointestinal clearance (<1.5%ID/g) and increased kidney clearance (>15 %ID/g) at 2 h after injection compared to the dipyridyl lysine complex (DpK). One of the new SAAC ligands, [(99m)Tc]bis-carboxymethylimidazole lysine, was conjugated to the N-terminus of Tyr-3 octreotide and evaluated for localization in nude mice bearing AR42J xenografts to examine tissue distribution, tumor uptake and retention, clearance, and route of excretion for comparison to (111)In-DOTA-Tyr-3-octreotide and (99m)Tc-DpK-Tyr-3-octreotide. (99m)Tc-bis-(carboxymethylimidazole)-lysine-Tyr-3-octreotide exhibited significantly less liver uptake and gastrointestinal clearance compared to (99m)Tc-DpK-Tyr-3-octreotide while maintaining tumor uptake in the same mouse model. These novel chelators demonstrate that lipophilicity can be controlled and organ distribution significantly altered, opening up broad application of these novel SAAC systems for radiopharmaceutical design.","Maresca, Kevin P; Marquis, John C; Hillier, Shawn M; Lu, Genliang; Femia, Frank J; Zimmerman, Craig N; Eckelman, William C; Joyal, John L; Babich, John W",Bioconjugate chemistry,579,1

While physical and social activity may protect against structural decline, other lifestyle behaviors may be accelerating factors. We examined whether riskier lifestyle correlates with accelerated brain aging using the BrainAGE score in 622 older adults from the 1000BRAINS cohort. Lifestyle was measured using a combined lifestyle risk score, composed of risk (smoking, alcohol intake) and protective variables (social integration and physical activity). We estimated individual BrainAGE from T1-weighted MRI data indicating accelerated brain atrophy by higher values. Then, the effect of combined lifestyle risk and individual lifestyle variables was regressed against BrainAGE. One unit increase in combined lifestyle risk predicted 5.04 months of additional BrainAGE. This prediction was driven by smoking (0.6 additional months of BrainAGE per pack-year) and physical activity (0.55 less months in BrainAGE per metabolic equivalent). Stratification by sex revealed a stronger association between physical activity and BrainAGE in males than females. Overall, our observations may be helpful with regard to lifestyle-related tailored prevention measures that slow changes in brain structure in older adults.","Bittner, Nora; Jockwitz, Christiane; Franke, Katja; Gaser, Christian; Moebus, Susanne; Bayen, Ute J; Amunts, Katrin; Caspers, Svenja",Brain structure & function,579,20

Methods and Results CVH was computed at 2 ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study visits in 1987 to 1989 and 1993 to 1995, using 7 metrics (smoking, body mass index, total cholesterol, blood glucose, blood pressure, physical activity, and diet), each classified as poor, intermediate, and ideal. Overall CVH was classified as poor, intermediate, and ideal to correspond to 0 to 2, 3 to 4, and 5 to 7 metrics at ideal levels. There 10 038 participants, aged 44 to 66 years that were eligible. From the first to the second study visit, there was an improvement in overall CVH for 17% of participants and a decrease in CVH for 21% of participants. At both study visits, 28%, 27%, and 6% had poor, intermediate, and ideal overall CVH, respectively. Compared with those with poor CVH at both visits, the risk of cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio [HR], 0.26; 95% CI, 0.20-0.34) and mortality (HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.29-0.44) was lowest in those with ideal CVH at both measures. Improvement from poor to intermediate/ideal CVH was also associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.59-0.75) and mortality (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72-0.89). Conclusions Improvement in CVH or stable ideal CVH, compared with those with poor CVH over time, is associated with a lower risk of incident cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. The change in smoking status and cholesterol may have accounted for a large part of the observed association.","Gaye, Bamba; Tajeu, Gabriel S; Vasan, Ramachandran S; Lassale, Camille; Allen, Norrina B; Singh-Manoux, Archana; Jouven, Xavier",Journal of the American Heart Association,579,1

The present study was aimed to evaluate whether MSCs could have a protective effect in hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN) and the underlying mechanisms. A rat HN model was established by oral administration of a mixture of potassium oxonate (PO, 1.5 g/kg) and adenine (Ad, 50 mg/kg) daily for 4 weeks. For MSCs treatment, MSCs (3 × 106 cells/kg per week) were injected via tail vein from the 2nd week for 3 times. The results showed that along with the elevated uric acid (UA) in HN rats, creatinine (CREA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), microalbuminuria (MAU) and 24-hour urinary protein levels were significantly increased comparing with the normal control rats, while decreased after MSCs treatment. Moreover, the mRNA levels of inflammation and fibrosis-related gene were reduced in UA + MSCs group. Consistently, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining results showed the destruction of kidney structure and fibrosis were significantly alleviated after MSCs administration. Similarly, in vitro, NRK-52Es cells were treated with high concentration UA (10 mg/dL) in the presence of MSCs, and we found that MSCs co-culture could inhibited UA-induced cell injury, characterized as improvement of cell viability and proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Collectively, MSCs treatment could effectively attenuate UA-induced renal injury, and thus it might be a potential therapy to hyperuricemia-related renal diseases.","Li, Lan; Cheng, Dongqi; An, Xingxing; Liao, Guangneng; Zhong, Ling; Liu, Jingping; Chen, Younan; Yuan, Yujia; Lu, Yanrong",International immunopharmacology,579,1

This has led to widespread research for the identification of molecular-based biomarkers. Among them, survivin is a recently characterized protein which is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis family. The aim of this study is evaluating the expression of survivin in oral leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, and OSCC compared with normal mucosa. Materials and Methods The retrospective study consisted of twenty cases of oral leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, and OSCC in the age group of 20-70 years. Twenty cases of normal mucosa made up the control group. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with the use of survivin polyclonal antibody. Grades of expression of survivin were evaluated. Kruskal-Wallis test was used for statistical analysis. Results The expression of survivin was higher in OSCC (80%) when compared to oral leukoplakia (70%), oral lichen planus (45%), and normal mucosa (35%). The variation in the expression of survivin between the samples was statistically significant with P = 0.015 (Kruskal-Wallis test significant at 0.01 level).

This communication can be made more complete and reliable with technologies that automatically document the actions of field medics. However, designing state-of-the-art technology for military field personnel and civilian first responders is challenging due to the barriers researchers face in accessing the environment and understanding situated actions and cognitive models employed in the field. OBJECTIVE To identify design insights for an automated sensing clinical documentation (ASCD) system, we sought to understand what information is transferred in trauma cases between prehospital and hospital personnel, and what contextual factors influence the collection, management, and handover of information in trauma cases, in both military and civilian cases. METHODS Using a multi-method approach including video review and focus groups, we developed an understanding of the information needs of trauma handoffs and the context of field documentation to inform the design of an automated sensing documentation system that uses wearables, cameras, and environmental sensors to passively infer clinical activity and automatically produce documentation. RESULTS Comparing military and civilian trauma documentation and handoff, we found similarities in the types of data collected and the prioritization of information. We found that military environments involved many more contextual factors that have implications for design, such as the physical environment (eg, heat, lack of lighting, lack of power) and the potential for active combat and triage, creating additional complexity. CONCLUSIONS An ineffectiveness of communication is evident in both the civilian and military worlds. We used multiple methods of inquiry to study the information needs of trauma care and handoff, and the context of medical work in the field. Our findings informed the design and evaluation of an automated documentation tool. The data illustrated the need for more accurate recordkeeping, specifically temporal aspects, during transportation, and characterized the environment in which field testing of the developed tool will take place. The employment of a systems perspective in this project produced design insights that our team would not have identified otherwise. These insights created exciting and interesting challenges for the technical team to resolve.","Novak, Laurie Lovett; Simpson, Christopher L; Coco, Joseph; McNaughton, Candace D; Ehrenfeld, Jesse M; Bloos, Sean M; Fabbri, Daniel",Journal of medical Internet research,579,1

AIM We investigated whether patients and their families were consistent in recognizing the occurrence and severity of symptomatic side effects of chemotherapy treatment for cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS This was a prospective observational study. We administered a questionnaire survey to patients and family members to assess the frequency of occurrence (1: never, 2: almost never, 3: sometimes, 4: frequently, 5: almost always, 6: unknown) and the degree of severity (1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe, 4: extremely severe, 5: unknown) of physical and psychological symptoms associated with cancer chemotherapy. Weighted Kappa and Cramer coefficients were used to assess consistency between the two groups. We surveyed 20 pairs of patients (5 men, 15 women) and their families (10 men, 10 women); 17 pairs lived together. The median age was 65.5 years (interquartile [IQR], 58.75, 69.25) for patients and 61.00 years (IQR, 47.25, 71.25) for family members. Of patients, 17 had solid cancer, and three had leukemia. Family members mostly recognized objectively visible symptoms such as hair loss and development of spots and keratinization. However, it was difficult for families to detect invisible subjective symptoms such as weakness, dysesthesia, depressed mood, and unarticulated anxiety. CONCLUSIONS The results indicated that recognition of invisible subjective symptoms in patients undergoing chemotherapy was difficult even for family members. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach in which various medical professionals actively communicate with both patients and families is important. Information sharing in collaboration with patients and families could increase understanding of the patient's condition and optimize patient care.","Horio, Fukuko; Ikeda, Tokunori; Arake, Yurimi; Kawashima, Nodoka; Eto, Erina; Matsukura, Makoto; Fujii, Isao; Uchida, Yuji",Cancer reports,579,1

Although these infections commonly have many cardiorespiratory sequelae, the national burden of influenza- and RSV-attributable cardiorespiratory events remains unknown for the multimorbid and vulnerable LTCF population. Objective To estimate the incidence of cardiorespiratory hospitalizations that were attributable to influenza and RSV among LTCF residents and to quantify the economic burden of these hospitalizations on the US health care system by estimating their associated cost and length of stay. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study used national Medicare Provider Analysis and Review inpatient claims and Minimum Data Set clinical assessments for 6 respiratory seasons (2011-2017). Long-stay residents of LTCFs were identified as those living in the facility for at least 100 days (index date), aged 65 years or older, and with 6 months of continuous enrollment in Medicare Part A were included. Follow-up occurred from the resident's index date until the first hospitalization, discharge from the LTCF, disenrollment from Medicare, death, or the end of the study. Residents could re-enter the sample; thus, long-stay episodes of care were identified. Data analysis was performed between January 1 and September 30, 2020. Exposures Seasonal circulating pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1), human influenza A(H3N2), influenza B, and RSV. Main Outcomes and Measures Cardiorespiratory hospitalizations (eg, asthma exacerbation, heart failure) were identified using primary diagnosis codes. Influenza- and RSV-attributable cardiorespiratory events were estimated using a negative binomial regression model adjusted for weekly circulating influenza and RSV testing data. Length of stay and costs of influenza- and RSV-attributable events were then estimated. Results The study population comprised 2 909 106 LTCF residents with 3 138 962 long-stay episodes and 5 079 872 person-years of follow-up. Overall, 10 939 (95% CI, 9413-12 464) influenza- and RSV-attributable cardiorespiratory events occurred, with an incidence of 215 (95% CI, 185-245) events per 100 000 person-years. The cost of influenza- and RSV-attributable cardiorespiratory events was $91 055 393 (95% CI, $77 885 316-$104 225 470), and the length of stay was 56 858 (95% CI, 48 757-64 968) days. Conclusions and Relevance This study found that many cardiorespiratory hospitalizations among LTCF residents in the US were attributable to seasonal influenza and RSV. To minimize the burden these events place on the health care system and residents of LTCFs and to prevent virus transmission, additional preventive measures should be implemented.","Bosco, Elliott; van Aalst, Robertus; McConeghy, Kevin W; Silva, Joe; Moyo, Patience; Eliot, Melissa N; Chit, Ayman; Gravenstein, Stefan; Zullo, Andrew R",JAMA network open,579,1

Methods: Data of reported NCP cases and Baidu Migration Indexin all provinces of the country as of February 14, 2020 were collected. The correlation analysis between cumulative number of reported cases and the migration index from Hubei was performed, and the imported risks from Hubei to different provinces across China were further evaluated. Results: A total of 49 970 confirmed cases were reported nationwide, of which 37 884 were in Hubei Province. The average daily migration index from Hubei to other provinces was 312.09, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei were 117.95 and 194.16, respectively. The cumulative NCP cases of provinces was positively correlated with the migration index derived from Hubei province, also in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei, with correlation coefficients of 0.84, 0.84, and 0.81. In linear model, population migration from Hubei Province, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei account for 71.2%, 70.1%, and 66.3% of the variation, respectively. The period of high exported risk from Hubei occurred before January 27, of which the risks before January 23 mainly came from Wuhan, and then mainly from other cities in Hubei. Hunan Province, Henan Province and Guangdong Province ranked the top three in terms of cumulative imported risk (the cumulative risk indices were 58.61, 54.75 and 49.62 respectively). Conclusion: The epidemic in each province was mainly caused by the importation of Hubei Province.

It is a leading cause of morbidity and revision following TJA. As such, PJI is a significant driver of healthcare costs. The prevalence of PJI related to resistant and atypical organisms is increasing, and approximately 10-30% of PJIs are culture-negative. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current epidemiology, diagnostics, and management of PJI associated with resistant and atypical pathogens and of culture-negative PJIs. METHODS The published literature related to the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of atypical, drug-resistant, and culture-negative PJI is reviewed. RESULTS The clinical diagnosis of PJI is often challenging, particularly when pathogens are fastidious or when antibiotics have been administered empirically. Molecular diagnostic studies, such as synovial α-defensin, may provide rapid, accurate identification of PJI, even in the setting of concurrent antibiotics administration or systemic inflammatory disease. Once PJI is diagnosed, two-stage exchange arthroplasty remains the gold standard for treating PJI with resistant microorganisms, since there is a high rate of treatment failure with irrigation and debridement and with one-stage exchange arthroplasty. CONCLUSION Additional research is needed to define the optimal treatment of PJIs associated with rare pathogens, such as fungi and mycobacteria. There is a need for inexpensive, reliable tests that rapidly detect specific microbial species and antimicrobial susceptibilities. Additional research is also required to define the specific organisms, clinical scenarios, surgical techniques, and antimicrobial regimens that allow for reproducible treatment success with prosthetic retention strategies.","McLawhorn, Alexander S; Nawabi, Danyal H; Ranawat, Amar S",The open orthopaedics journal,579,1

In spite of ongoing improvements, provincial and sub-provincial leaders face barriers, such as established modes of operation, lack of training, shortage of trained risk communicators, and limited understanding and willingness of recipients to mitigate risks. METHODS We assessed the current status of and barriers to risk communication knowledge and practice among public health practitioners in China. We designed the survey questionnaire to capture information related to the risk communication core capacities required by international health regulations and common risk communication principles. RESULTS Our findings showed that risk communication training has successfully developed an awareness of risk communication principles and the ability to implement those principles in practice in China. CONCLUSIONS Future efforts should focus on areas such as a dedicated risk communication workforce, requirements that public health agencies develop a risk communication plan, and additional training for public health practitioners and their partners. It is critical that the infectious diseases prevention and control law be amended to grant provincial and local public health agencies more autonomy to release information.","Cope, James R; Frost, Melinda; Richun, Li; Xie, Ruiqian",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,579,6

Aim of this manuscript is to describe our experience with the roll-out and utilization of a virtual pre-transplant evaluation platform to facilitate ongoing transplant wait-listing during the early peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN This is a retrospective analysis of the process improvement project implemented to continue the evaluation of potential kidney transplant candidates and ensure waitlist placement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Operational metrics include transplant volume per month, referral volume per month, pre-transplant patients halted prior to completing an evaluation per month, evaluations completed per and patients waitlisted per month. RESULTS Between April and September 2020, a total of 1258 patients completed an evaluation. 247 patients were halted during this time period prior to completing a full evaluation. 152 patients were presented at selection and113 placed on the waitlist. Furthermore, patients in the active referral phase were able to be reduced by 46%.More evaluations were completed within the virtual platform (n=930 vs n= 880) yielding similar additions to the waitlist in 2020 (n=282) versus 2019 (n=308) despite the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The virtual platform allowed continued maintenance of a large kidney transplant program despite the inability to live in person visits. The value of this platform will likely transform our approach to the pre-transplant process and provides an additional valuable method to improve patient equity and access to transplant.","Rohan, Vinayak S; Pilch, Nicole; Cassidy, Deborah; McGillicuddy, John; White, Jared; Lin, Angello; Nadig, Satish N; Taber, David J; Dubay, Derek; Baliga, Prabhakar K",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,579,29

Pathology reports were requested from all NA zoological institutions housing snow leopards that died between 01 January 1999 and 31 December 2019. Data were reviewed and cause of death (COD) and concurrent diseases were summarized and compared by age group, organ system, and disease process. The 241 snow leopards in this report include 109 males, 130 females, and two of undetermined sex. Among them were 116 geriatric snow leopards (>15 yr), 72 adults (15-3 yr), 16 juveniles (3 yr to 2 mo), 32 neonates (2 mo to 0 days), and five fetuses (<0 days). Overall, noninfectious diseases were the most common COD across all age groups (73%). In adult and geriatric snow leopards, chronic renal disease (CRD) (38.8%) and malignant neoplasia (19.7%), including oral squamous cell carcinoma (6.4%), were a common COD. In juveniles and neonates, perinatal death and congenital diseases, including ocular coloboma (15.6%), were a common COD. Individuals with CRD were 13.5 and 4.36 times more likely to have veno-occlusive disease and cardiac fibrosis, respectively. Snow leopards with urolithiasis were 5.27 times more likely to have CRD. Infectious (14.1%) and inflammatory diseases (8.7%) for which no specific etiology was identified were less common overall and more common in juveniles and neonates (25% and 21%, respectively). Neoplasms not previously reported in snow leopards or that are generally uncommon in the veterinary literature included transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (n = 7) and mesothelioma (n = 1).","Womble, Mandy; Georoff, Timothy A; Helmick, Kelly; Carpenter, Nancy A; Joslin, Janis; Tupa, Lynn; Tetzloff, Jay; McAloose, Denise",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,579,1

Here we report a novel vaccination regimen consisting of a mucosal prime with a modified replicating vaccinia virus Tiantan strain (MVTT(SIVgpe)) and an intramuscular boost with a nonreplicating adenovirus strain (Ad5(SIVgpe)). This regimen elicited robust cellular immune responses with enhanced magnitudes, sustainability, and polyfunctionality, as well as higher titers of neutralizing antibodies against the simian immunodeficiency virus SIV(mac1A11) in rhesus monkeys. The reductions in peak and set-point viral loads were significant in most animals, with one other animal being protected fully from high-dose intrarectal inoculation of SIV(mac239). Furthermore, the animals vaccinated with this regimen were healthy, while ~75% of control animals developed simian AIDS.

To date, pathologic analyses have been limited to patient reports and autopsy series. METHODS We evaluated biopsy samples of native and allograft kidneys from patients with COVID-19 at a single center in New York City between March and June of 2020. We also used immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and electron microscopy to examine this tissue for presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS The study group included 17 patients with COVID-19 (12 men, 12 black; median age of 54 years). Sixteen patients had comorbidities, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes, malignancy, or a kidney or heart allograft. Nine patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Fifteen patients (88%) presented with AKI; nine had nephrotic-range proteinuria. Among 14 patients with a native kidney biopsy, 5 were diagnosed with collapsing glomerulopathy, 1 was diagnosed with minimal change disease, 2 were diagnosed with membranous glomerulopathy, 1 was diagnosed with crescentic transformation of lupus nephritis, 1 was diagnosed with anti-GBM nephritis, and 4 were diagnosed with isolated acute tubular injury. The three allograft specimens showed grade 2A acute T cell-mediated rejection, cortical infarction, or acute tubular injury. Genotyping of three patients with collapsing glomerulopathy and the patient with minimal change disease revealed that all four patients had APOL1 high-risk gene variants. We found no definitive evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in kidney cells. Biopsy diagnosis informed treatment and prognosis in all patients. CONCLUSIONS Patients with COVID-19 develop a wide spectrum of glomerular and tubular diseases. Our findings provide evidence against direct viral infection of the kidneys as the major pathomechanism for COVID-19-related kidney injury and implicate cytokine-mediated effects and heightened adaptive immune responses.","Kudose, Satoru; Batal, Ibrahim; Santoriello, Dominick; Xu, Katherine; Barasch, Jonathan; Peleg, Yonatan; Canetta, Pietro; Ratner, Lloyd E; Marasa, Maddalena; Gharavi, Ali G; Stokes, M Barry; Markowitz, Glen S; D'Agati, Vivette D",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,579,1

Previous studies have shown that in natural Tregs (nTregs), FOXP3 can be regulated by polyubiquitination and deubiquitination. However, the molecular players active in this pathway, especially those modulating FOXP3 by deubiquitination in the distinct induced Treg (iTreg) lineage, remain unclear. Here, we identify the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 44 (USP44) as a novel deubiquitinase for FOXP3. USP44 interacts with and stabilizes FOXP3 by removing K48-linked ubiquitin modifications. Notably, TGF-β induces USP44 expression during iTreg differentiation. USP44 co-operates with USP7 to stabilize and deubiquitinate FOXP3. Tregs genetically lacking USP44 are less effective than their wild-type counterparts, both in vitro and in multiple in vivo models of inflammatory disease and cancer. These findings suggest that USP44 plays an important role in the post-translational regulation of Treg function and is thus a potential therapeutic target for tolerance-breaking anti-cancer immunotherapy.","Yang, Jing; Wei, Ping; Barbi, Joseph; Huang, Qianru; Yang, Evan; Bai, Yakun; Nie, Jia; Gao, Yanhang; Tao, Jinhui; Lu, Ying; Xie, Chichu; Hou, Xiaoxia; Ren, Jiazi; Wu, Xingmei; Meng, Jian; Zhang, Ying; Fu, Juan; Kou, Wei; Gao, Yayi; Chen, Zuojia; Liang, Rui; Tsun, Andy; Li, Dan; Guo, Wenzhi; Zhang, Shuijun; Zheng, Song-Guo; Niu, Junqi; Galardy, Paul; Tong, Xuemei; Shi, Guochao; Li, Huabin; Pan, Fan; Li, Bin",EMBO reports,579,1

While marginal food security falls next to high food security on the spectrum, new quantitative research indicates marginal food security status is associated with negative health outcomes and poor academic performance among college students. Qualitative research focusing on college students experiencing marginal food security has not been conducted. This study aims to qualitatively explore experiences of college students with marginal food security and to identify themes to better understand and provide context regarding how marginal food security impacts students. DESIGN Students were recruited for semi-structured interviews with questions designed to study the challenges associated with students' food situations. All interviews were recorded and transcribed with themes identified via an inductive approach. SETTING A large public university on the US west coast. PARTICIPANTS Thirty college students. RESULTS Key themes that emerged: purchasing cheap unhealthy foods; insufficient time to prepare and eat meals on a regular basis; stress and anxiety around the inability to eat healthy food and future health issues; self-perception of health when eating poorly along with physical symptoms; and low academic motivation by not fully participating in their courses due to few healthy food options or missing meals. CONCLUSION Marginal food security can potentially diminish students' health and their capacity to learn and succeed in their coursework. The results emphasize that students experiencing marginal food security should not be grouped with students experiencing high food security.","Gamba, Ryan J; Schmeltz, Michael T; Ortiz, Nancy; Engelman, Alina; Lam, Juleen; Ampil, Adianez; Pritchard, Maria M; Santillan, Joshua Kier Adrian; Rivera, Esteban S; Wood, Lana Mariko; Ingram, Darice; Cheyne, Kate; Taylor, Sarah",Public health nutrition,579,24

METHODS Mortality and underlying causes of death were ascertained from the National Death Index. Indirect standardization using age- and sex-specific nationwide all-cause and cause-specific mortality data extracted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder Online Database allowed for calculation of standardized mortality ratios (SMR). RESULTS There were 47 deaths (96% female) among 1437 IHR participants that met inclusion criteria. The average age at death was 46 years (range, 20-95 years). Participants of the IHR experienced higher all-cause mortality than the general population (SMR, 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.1). Suicide, accidents, and deaths from medical/surgical complications were the most common underlying causes, accounting for 43% of all deaths. When compared to the general population, the risk of suicide was over 6 times greater (SMR, 6.1; 95% CI, 2.9-12.7) and the risk of death from accidental overdose was over 3 times greater (SMR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.6-7.7). The risk of suicide by overdose was over 15 times greater among the IHR cohort than in the general population (SMR, 15.3; 95% CI, 6.4-36.7). CONCLUSIONS Patients with IIH in the IHR possess significantly increased risks of death from suicide and accidental overdose compared to the general population. Complications of medical/surgical treatments were also major contributors to mortality. Depression and disability were common among decedents.","Hermes, Sam M; Miller, Nick R; Waslo, Carin S; Benes, Susan C; Tanne, Emanuel",Neurology,579,1

It has also generated considerable biomedical interest not only because of its extraordinary longevity, but also because of unusual protective features (e.g. its tolerance of variable oxygen availability), which may be pertinent to several human disease states, including ischemia/reperfusion injury and neurodegeneration. A recent article entitled 'Surprisingly long survival of premature conclusions about naked mole-rat biology' described 28 'myths' which, those authors claimed, are a 'perpetuation of beautiful, but falsified, hypotheses' and impede our understanding of this enigmatic mammal. Here, we re-examine each of these 'myths' based on evidence published in the scientific literature. Following Braude et al., we argue that these 'myths' fall into four main categories: (i) 'myths' that would be better described as oversimplifications, some of which persist solely in the popular press; (ii) 'myths' that are based on incomplete understanding, where more evidence is clearly needed; (iii) 'myths' where the accumulation of evidence over the years has led to a revision in interpretation, but where there is no significant disagreement among scientists currently working in the field; (iv) 'myths' where there is a genuine difference in opinion among active researchers, based on alternative interpretations of the available evidence. The term 'myth' is particularly inappropriate when applied to competing, evidence-based hypotheses, which form part of the normal evolution of scientific knowledge. Here, we provide a comprehensive critical review of naked mole-rat biology and attempt to clarify some of these misconceptions.","Buffenstein, Rochelle; Amoroso, Vincent; Andziak, Blazej; Avdieiev, Stanislav; Azpurua, Jorge; Barker, Alison J; Bennett, Nigel C; Brieño-Enríquez, Miguel A; Bronner, Gary N; Coen, Clive; Delaney, Martha A; Dengler-Crish, Christine M; Edrey, Yael H; Faulkes, Chris G; Frankel, Daniel; Friedlander, Gerard; Gibney, Patrick A; Gorbunova, Vera; Hine, Christopher; Holmes, Melissa M; Jarvis, Jennifer U M; Kawamura, Yoshimi; Kutsukake, Nobuyuki; Kenyon, Cynthia; Khaled, Walid T; Kikusui, Takefumi; Kissil, Joseph; Lagestee, Samantha; Larson, John; Lauer, Amanda; Lavrenchenko, Leonid A; Lee, Angela; Levitt, Jonathan B; Lewin, Gary R; Lewis Hardell, Kaitlyn N; Lin, TzuHua D; Mason, Matthew J; McCloskey, Dan; McMahon, Mary; Miura, Kyoko; Mogi, Kazutaka; Narayan, Vikram; O'Connor, Timothy P; Okanoya, Kazuo; O'Riain, M Justin; Park, Thomas J; Place, Ned J; Podshivalova, Katie; Pamenter, Matthew E; Pyott, Sonja J; Reznick, Jane; Ruby, J Graham; Salmon, Adam B; Santos-Sacchi, Joseph; Sarko, Diana K; Seluanov, Andrei; Shepard, Alyssa; Smith, Megan; Storey, Kenneth B; Tian, Xiao; Vice, Emily N; Viltard, Mélanie; Watarai, Akiyuki; Wywial, Ewa; Yamakawa, Masanori; Zemlemerova, Elena D; Zions, Michael; Smith, Ewan St John",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,579,12

METHODS All outpatient surgeries performed at The Ottawa Hospital between April 1, 2008, and March 31, 2018 by urology, general surgery, gynecology, and thoracic surgery were identified. All ER encounters within 90 days of surgery were captured. Rates of ER encounters by surgical service and procedure type were determined. Patient and surgical factors associated with ER encounters were identified. Factors included age, sex, marital status, presence of primary care provider, procedure, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score. RESULTS A total of 38 377 outpatient surgeries by the included surgical services were performed during the study period, of which urology performed 16 552 (43.1%). Overall, 5641 (14.7%) ER encounters were identified within 90 days of surgery, including 2681 (47.5%) after urologic surgery. On multivariable analysis, higher ASA score IV vs. I was associated with higher risk of ER encounter (relative risk [RR] 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46-2.5) and being married was associated with a lower risk of ER encounter (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.93).

We developed an artificial intelligence system with deep learning that can automatically detect small-bowel angioectasia in CE images. METHODS We trained a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) system based on Single Shot Multibox Detector using 2,237 CE images of angioectasia. We assessed its diagnostic accuracy by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value using an independent test set of 10,488 small-bowel images, including 488 images of small-bowel angioectasia. RESULTS The AUC to detect angioectasia was 0.998. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of CNN were 98.8%, 98.4%, 75.4%, and 99.9%, respectively, at a cut-off value of 0.36 for the probability score. CONCLUSIONS We developed and validated a new system based on CNN to automatically detect angioectasia in CE images. This may be well applicable to daily clinical practice to reduce the burden of physicians as well as to reduce oversight. This article is protected by copyright.

We aimed to establish whether the use of hydrogel coils improved efficacy outcomes compared with bare platinum coils. MATERIALS AND METHODS PRET was an investigator-led, pragmatic, multicenter, parallel, randomized (1:1) trial. Randomized allocation was performed separately for patients in PRET-1 and PRET-2, by using a Web-based platform ensuring concealed allocation. The primary outcome was a composite of a residual/recurrent aneurysm, adjudicated by a blinded core laboratory, or retreatment, intracranial bleeding, or mass effect during the 18-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, mortality, and morbidity (mRS > 2). The hypothesis was that hydrogel would decrease the primary outcome from 50% to 30% at 18 months, necessitating 125 patients per group (500 for PRET-1 and PRET-2). RESULTS The trial was stopped once 250 patients in PRET-1 and 197 in PRET-2 had been recruited because of slow accrual. A poor primary outcome occurred in 44.4% (95% CI, 35.5%-53.2%) of those in PRET-1 allocated to platinum compared with 52.5% (95% CI, 43.4%-61.6%) of patients allocated to hydrogel (OR, 1.387; 95% CI, 0.838-2.295; P = .20) and in 49.0% (95% CI, 38.8%-59.1%) in PRET-2 allocated to platinum compared with 42.1% (95% CI, 32.0%-52.2%) allocated to hydrogel (OR, 0.959; 95% CI, 0.428-1.342; P = .34). Adverse events and morbidity were similar. There were 3.6% deaths (1.4% platinum, 5.9% hydrogel; P = .011). CONCLUSIONS Coiling of large and recurrent aneurysms is safe but often poorly effective according to angiographic results. Hydrogel coiling was not shown to be better than platinum.","Raymond, J; Klink, R; Chagnon, M; Barnwell, S L; Evans, A J; Mocco, J; Hoh, B H; Turk, A S; Turner, R D; Desal, H; Fiorella, D; Bracard, S; Weill, A; Guilbert, F; Lanthier, S; Fox, A J; Darsaut, T E; White, P M; Roy, D",AJNR.

METHODS The data came from the prospective national representative Santé et Itinéraire Professionnel (SIP) survey, including a sample of 5600 French workers interviewed in 2006 and 2010. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to measure MDE and GAD. Analyses were performed using weighted generalized estimation equations, and were stratified by gender. RESULTS No changes in MDE and GAD were observed for both genders among the working population. No differential changes were observed, except one: the prevalence of GAD increased among women working in the public sector while there was no change among women in the private sector. LIMITATIONS Two data collections over a 4-year period may not capture the effects of the crisis on mental disorders properly. CONCLUSION No changes in mental disorders between 2006 and 2010 were found but the increase in the prevalence of anxiety among women in the public sector may be of particular interest for prevention policies.

Clinical data and perioperative hemodynamic parameters, blood tests and time of surgery were recorded. Postoperative infarct volume was quantitatively assessed by semiautomatic segmentation. Mean diastolic blood pressure (dBP) during surgery (rho -0.239, 95% CI -0.11 - -0.367, p = 0.017), liquid balance (rho 0.236, 95% CI 0.1-0.373, p = 0.017) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) during surgery (rho -0.206, 95% CI -0.07 - -0.34, p = 0.041) showed significant correlation to infarct volume. A rank regression model including also age and recurrent surgery as possible confounders revealed mean intraoperative dBP, liquid balance and length of surgery as independent factors for infarct volume. Univariate survival analysis showed mean intraoperative dBP and MAP as significant prognostic factors, length of surgery also remained as significant prognostic factor in a multivariate model. Perioperative close anesthesiologic monitoring of blood pressure and liquid balance is of high significance during brain tumor surgery and should be performed to prevent or minimize perioperative infarctions and to prolong survival.","Bette, Stefanie; Wiestler, Benedikt; Wiedenmann, Felicitas; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Bretschneider, Martin; Barz, Melanie; Huber, Thomas; Ryang, Yu-Mi; Kochs, Eberhard; Zimmer, Claus; Meyer, Bernhard; Boeckh-Behrens, Tobias; Kirschke, Jan S; Gempt, Jens",Scientific reports,579,12

We aimed to evaluate the clinical implications of trabeculation and its relevance to outcomes. A total of 296 patients (age 63 ± 12 years; 64% men) with trabeculation who underwent echocardiography were retrospectively identified between January 2011 and December 2012. Analyses were conducted on distinguished trabeculation which was divided into NC (maximum noncompacted/compacted ratio ≥ 2.0) or hypertrabeculation (HT) (ratio < 2.0). We evaluated features of trabeculation and explored cardiovascular (CV) outcome events (coronary revascularization, hospitalization for worsening heart failure (HF), stroke, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), and CV death). Over a mean of 4.2 years, CV outcome events occurred in 122 (41%) patients who were older and exhibited an increased frequency of diabetes mellitus, stroke, implantation of ICD, HF and dilated cardiomyopathy. The frequencies of NC or HT, the trabeculation ratio and its manifestation were similar among patients with and without events. NC/HT with concomitant apical hypocontractility and worsening systolic function were univariable predictors of adverse events. On multivariable analysis, concomitant apical hypocontractility on NC/HT remained significant (hazard ratio 8.94, 95% confidence interval 2.9-27.2, p < 0.001) together with old age, HF and increased E/e' ratio.

Methods: Prospective cohort study of very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants with hsPDA requiring treatment from March 2014 to December 2016 in a tertiary Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in Singapore. NIRS was applied at diagnosis until 24-48 hours after the last dose of ibuprofen or postsurgical ligation. All PDAs were documented to be closed by echocardiography. Post-treatment values (control group) were compared against pretreatment values. Results: 29 infants were studied, with mean gestational age of 26.7 weeks and birthweight of 956g.Median day of life of PDA diagnosis was 4. Seven infants (24.1%) underwent PDA ligation. There was significant reduction in FTOE before treatment till after last dose of medication or ligation by a mean difference of 7.27% (p < 0.05). Reduction in FTOE was also found between the first dose of medication till after the last dose or ligation. Cerebral SrO2 significantly increased between first dose of medication till last dose of medication by a mean difference of 3.09% (p = 0.034). RrSO2 values were not significantly affected. No correlation between NIRS values and PDA size was found. Conclusion: Significant increase in cerebral SrO2 and reduction in FTOE by NIRS post PDA closure in hemodynamically significant PDAs suggest that PDA closure may reduce cerebral hypoxia burden.","Poon, Woei Bing; Tagamolila, Vina","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",579,1

OBJECTIVE Our primary objective was to compare reported fusion rates after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) using structural allograft versus polyetheretherketone (PEEK) interbody devices in patients with cervical spine degeneration. Our secondary objectives were to compare differences in rates of subsidence and reoperation and in patient-reported outcomes between the 2 groups. METHODS Through a systematic review of the English-language literature using various databases, we identified 4702 articles. After we applied inclusion and exclusion criteria, 14 articles (7 randomized controlled trials, 4 prospective studies, and 3 retrospective studies) reporting fusion rates of structural allograft or PEEK interbody devices were eligible for our analysis. No randomized controlled trials compared outcomes of structural allograft versus PEEK interbody devices. Extracted data included authors, study years, study designs, sample sizes, patient ages, duration of follow-up, types of interbody devices used, fusion rates, definition of fusion, reoperation rates, subsidence rates, and patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS Fusion rates were 82% to 100% for allograft and 88% to 98% for PEEK interbody devices. The reported data were insufficient to perform meta-analysis. Structural allograft had the highest reported rate of reoperation (14%), and PEEK interbody devices had the highest reported subsidence rate (18%). Patient-reported outcomes improved in both groups. There was insufficient high-quality evidence to compare the associations of various PEEK modifications with fusion rates. CONCLUSION Fusion rates were similar between structural allograft and PEEK interbody devices when used for ACDF for cervical spine degeneration. Currently, there is insufficient high-quality evidence to assess associations of PEEK modifications with fusion rates.

However, Laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery requires a high degree of skill. Any surgeon who is going to embark on these difficult resections should have at a minimum laparoscopic suturing skills in order to be able to close the peritoneal defect. METHODS In laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer, the intracorporeal suture technique required to close the pelvic cavity is very difficult. Barbed sutures have recently been proposed to facilitate laparoscopic suturing. Two patients with rectal cancer who underwent laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection (APR) with intracorporeal closure of the pelvic cavity from September to October 2012 were enrolled in this study. RESULTS We present our initial experience of two consecutive cases of intracorporeal closure of the pelvic cavity by totally laparoscopic APR. After clinical follow-up, the two patients have no complaints and have shown no signs of recurrence.

Because patients with diabetes and foot ulcers may have a higher risk for amputations, techniques that facilitate complex wound healing and prevent limb amputation are desirable. Here, we investigate a limb preservation strategy that includes application of a human acellular dermal wound matrix (HADWM). METHOD Medical history, physical examination and full wound assessment were completed for all patients. Systemic antibiotics and appropriate offloading were prescribed as needed. Wounds were debrided to create a bleeding bone and/or wound base for HADWM (Graftjacket regenerative tissue matrix, Wright Medical Technology, Inc., licensed by KCI, an Acelity company, San Antonio, TX). Healing progress was monitored over four weeks with weekly postoperative visits. 'Healed' was defined as full epithelialisation without drainage. RESULTS Lower extremity ulcers, 16 in 13 patients, were treated with HADWM between May 2004 and July 2013. The median patient age was 76 years (range: 38-90). The average number of comorbidities was three per patient, while 6 (46%) patients had ≥4 comorbidities. Diabetes mellitus (92%) and peripheral vascular disease (77%) were the two most common. All 16 (100%) wounds healed without complications. There were no recurrences in the 11 wounds of the nine patients available for follow-up. Of these patients two had previously advised to receive major leg amputations retained functional limbs. CONCLUSION The results in this small study reflect our practice's 10-year experience using HADWM as part of a limb preservation strategy.","Williams, M L; Holewinski, J E",Journal of wound care,579,24

Therefore, it is prudent for transplant centers to know the rules of engagement as it pertains to their practice. RECENT FINDINGS OPTN besides providing the regulatory oversight for safe and continued practice of transplant centers, provides necessary tools like: advanced statistical models and technological platforms to aid, and guide transplant centers including the necessary safeguards for high-quality transplant care.CMS regulations although had different thresholds to flag underperformance, often covered common grounds similar to the OPTN, therefore considered duplicative and unnecessary. But with much deliberation and consideration CMS undertook a major overhaul to the final rule for re-approval applications, a giant leap in the positive direction for transplant innovation and growth. SUMMARY The duplicative regulatory framework of OPTN and CMS has although achieved the goal of improving 1-year patient outcomes, it has proven costly in terms of slowing innovation, increasing organ discard and stunting growth of transplant volume.

METHODS ARAMIS was first compared with two transanal minimally invasive surgery platforms (SILS Port and GelPOINT Path) on human cadavers. Surgeons with different experience performed running sutures at different distances, at four quadrants, using the three platforms and gave a score to visibility, safety, and maneuverability. ARAMIS was then utilized on patients affected with rectal neoplasia who met the inclusion criteria. Patients and tumor characteristic and results were prospectively collected. The follow-up examinations included proctoscopy at 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS According to surgeons' scores, ARAMIS improves visibility and safety with respect to other platforms for distances beyond 10 cm. The procedure, which lasted an average of 59 min, was successfully carried out in 14 patients. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were reported. The mean tumor size was 3 cm; they were located a mean of 11 cm from the anal verge. Complete removal of the lesion was possible in 13/14 patients. There was one case of adenoma recurrence at follow-up. CONCLUSION Study results showed that ARAMIS, which is equipped with an adjustable rectoscope, can be considered a safe, effective platform for transanal surgery. The rectoscope protects the rectum during the procedure, a particularly important consideration when proximal rectal lesions are being treated. Further clinical studies are warranted to confirm these encouraging results.","Polese, Lino; Rizzato, Roberto; Porzionato, Andrea; Da Dalt, Gianfranco; Bressan, Alice; De Caro, Raffaele; Merigliano, Stefano",International journal of colorectal disease,579,1

Flow cytometry was introduced to evaluate cell apoptosis. The protein levels of C-caspase 3 were determined by western blot. The starBase was used to predict the interaction between miR-195-5p and AFAP1-AS1. Xenograft tumor model was established to investigate the biological role of AFAP1-AS1 in PTX resistance in vivo. The levels of AFAP1-AS1 and FKBP1A were upregulated in PCa tissues and cells, as well as PTX-resistant PCa cells, while the expression of miR-195-5p was declined. Knockdown of AFAP1-AS1 promoted the sensitivity of PTX-resistant PCa cells to PTX, induced apoptosis of PTX-resistant PCa cells, whereas the impacts could be reversed by reducing the expression of miR-195-5p. FKBP1A overexpression could rescue the effects of miR-195-5p-mediated enhancement on the sensitivity of PTX-resistant PCa cells to PTX, promotion on apoptosis of PTX-resistant PCa cells. AFAP1-AS1 interacted with miR-195-5p and miR-195-5p could bind to the 3'UTR of FKBP1A. AFAP1-AS1 silencing inhibited the tumor growth in mice implanted with PC3-TXR cell. The protein level of PCNA was decreased in PC3-TXR cells transfected with sh-AFAP1-AS1, while the expression of C-caspase 3 was upregulated. AFAP1-AS1 silencing attenuated the resistance of PTX-resistant PCa cells to PTX by downregulating FKBP1A via sponging miR-195-5p.","Leng, Weiping; Liu, Qingzuo; Zhang, Shidong; Sun, Dekang; Guo, Yongshun",Cancer biology & therapy,579,12

Advances in early diagnosis and therapeutic strategies have decreased the mortality of BC and improved the prognosis of patients to some extent. However, the development of drug resistance has limited the success rate of systemic therapies. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in drug resistance in BC via various mechanisms, which contribute to a complex regulatory network. In this review, we summarize the latest findings on the mechanisms underlying drug resistance modulated by lncRNAs in BC. In addition, we discuss the potential clinical applications of lncRNAs as targeted molecular therapy against drug resistance in BC.","Du, Tonghua; Shi, Ying; Xu, Shengnan; Wan, Xiaoyu; Sun, Haiyin; Liu, Bin",OncoTargets and therapy,579,16

The dual-track interactive nursing model is a nursing intervention aimed to provide specific and community nursing. For patients with chronic diseases, this model can improve the patients' self-management and rehabilitation. The effect of this model on the mental health of patients with chronic diseases has been unanimously recognized by researchers. In this study, a dual-track interactive nursing model intervention was conducted on the anxiety and depression in elderly patients with coronary heart disease to verify the psychological effect of the model. SUBJECTS AND METHODS From June 2018 to June 2019, 136 elderly patients with coronary heart disease (mean age of 63.5±8.26 years) from three communities in Changsha, Hunan Province, China were selected as subjects. A total of 53 and 50 patients were identified in the intervention and the control groups, respectively. The control group underwent routine longitudinal referral, whereas the intervention group was subjected to a two-track interactive nursing model intervention. The Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) and related questionnaires were used to monitor and compare the two groups before and after the intervention and employed for scoring and comparative analysis. RESULTS After the intervention, the mental health scores of the intervention group in total score, somatization, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, and paranoia are significantly lower than those of the control group (P<0.05). The intervention group has scored significantly higher in coping style but significantly lower in negative coping than the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The application of the dual-track interactive nursing model intervention in the management of patients with coronary heart disease can improve the self-management and the mental health of patients with coronary heart disease.","Yang, Jiao; Hu, Hongling; Li, Yamin",Psychiatria Danubina,579,7

In vitro studies indicate that the antiviral effect of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) requires a high concentration of the drug. Objective To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 CQ dosages in patients with severe COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted from March 23 to April 5, 2020, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Interventions Patients were allocated to receive high-dosage CQ (ie, 600 mg CQ twice daily for 10 days) or low-dosage CQ (ie, 450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days). Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was reduction in lethality by at least 50% in the high-dosage group compared with the low-dosage group. Data presented here refer primarily to safety and lethality outcomes during treatment on day 13. Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results. Outcomes will be presented to day 28. Viral respiratory secretion RNA detection was performed on days 0 and 4. Results Out of a predefined sample size of 440 patients, 81 were enrolled (41 [50.6%] to high-dosage group and 40 [49.4%] to low-dosage group). Enrolled patients had a mean (SD) age of 51.1 (13.9) years, and most (60 [75.3%]) were men. Older age (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [13.7] years vs 47.4 [13.3] years) and more heart disease (5 of 28 [17.9%] vs 0) were seen in the high-dose group. Viral RNA was detected in 31 of 40 (77.5%) and 31 of 41 (75.6%) patients in the low-dosage and high-dosage groups, respectively. Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40). The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]). Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%). Conclusions and Relevance The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir. These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.

Ninety Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into three groups (n = 30 per group). In sham group, rats received laparotomy, and the intestine was exposed for 15 minutes without II. In I/R + saline group and I/R + hydrogen group, rats received II after laparotomy and then intestine was relocated 8 hours later, followed by immediately intraperitoneal injection of normal saline and hydrogen rich water (HRW) (5 mL/kg), respectively. One hour later, the intestine was collected for hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry for apoptotic cells and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine, and blood was harvested for detection of tumor necrosis factor-α, malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed the intestinal mucosa was significantly damaged in I/R + saline group, which was markedly attenuated after HRW treatment. The serum tumor necrosis factor-α content increased significantly in I/R + saline group, but HRW treatment reduced serum tumor necrosis factor-α content as compared to I/R + saline group (P < 0.05). Serum malondialdehyde content and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine positive cells in the intestine increased dramatically after II, but HRW significantly reduced them in I/R+hydrogen group (P < 0.05). In addition, superoxide dismutase activity reduced markedly and apoptotic cells increased in I/R + saline group as compared to sham group, but they HRW increased superoxide dismutase activity and reduced apoptotic cells significantly in I/R + hydrogen group (P < 0.05). Our results indicate hydrogen rich water is able to attenuate II induced intestinal I/R injury via inhibiting intestinal inflammation, attenuating intestinal/serum oxidative stress and reducing apoptotic intestinal cells.","Wu, Mao-Jun; Chen, Min; Sang, Sang; Hou, Long-Long; Tian, Mao-Lang; Li, Kuang; Lv, Fang-Qi",Medical gas research,579,17

DESIGN Prospective, randomized controlled trial. SETTING University Hospital. SUBJECTS 200 adult ASA physical status I and II patients scheduled for surgery. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to two groups, one to receive ventilation via the EzT (n = 100) or the ETT (n = 100). After preoxygenation and induction with fentanyl and propofol, patients received muscle relaxation. The respective airway device was then inserted and mechanical ventilation was instituted. MEASUREMENTS Ease of insertion, number of insertion maneuvers, time until airtight seal of the airway was achieved, duration of surgery, leak pressure as well as arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)) data, were recorded. MAIN RESULTS Mallampati airway class was higher in the EzT group (P < 0.029), while thyromental distance showed no difference between the two groups. Ease of insertion was noted in the EzT group (P < 0.043). Number of insertions was equal in both groups; insertion time was shorter with the EzT (15.5 +/- 3.6 sec vs. 19.3 +/- 4.6 sec; P < 0.0001). Leak pressure and SpO(2) were not significantly different, while ETCO(2) was lower with the ETT (P < 0.024). Adjustments had to be made for two EzT group patients. No difference in frequency of laryngo-pharyngeal discomfort was observed in either group. CONCLUSION Insertion of an EzT appears to reduce time and facilitate placement of an airway device when compared with direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.","Lorenz, Veit; Rich, James M; Schebesta, Karl; Taslakian, Sevak; Müllner, Michael; Frass, Michael; Schuster, Ernst; Illievich, Udo M; Kaye, Alan D; Vaida, Sonia; Krafft, Peter",Journal of clinical anesthesia,579,24

While some SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals present as asymptomatic, others exhibit mild symptoms that may include fever, cough, chills, and unusual symptoms like loss of taste and smell and reddening in the extremities (e.g., ""COVID toes"", suggestive of microvessel damage). Still others alarm healthcare providers with extreme and rapid onset of high-risk indicators of mortality that include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ hypercoagulation, hypoxia and cardiovascular damage. Researchers are quickly refocusing their science to address this enigmatic virus that seems to unveil itself in new ways without discrimination. As investigators begin to identify early markers of disease, identification of common threads with other pathologies may provide some clues. Interestingly, years of research in the field of radiation biology documents the complex multi-organ nature of another disease state that occurs after exposure to high doses of radiation: the acute radiation syndrome (ARS). Inflammation is a key common player in COVID-19 and ARS, and drives the multi-system damage that dramatically alters biological homeostasis. Both conditions initiate a cytokine storm, with similar pro-inflammatory molecules increased and other anti-inflammatory molecules decreased. These changes manifest in a variety of ways, with a demonstrably higher health impact in patients having underlying medical conditions. The potentially dramatic human impact of ARS has guided the science that has identified many biomarkers of radiation exposure, established medical management strategies for ARS, and led to the development of medical countermeasures for use in the event of a radiation public health emergency. These efforts can now be leveraged to help elucidate mechanisms of action of COVID-19 injuries. Furthermore, this intersection between COVID-19 and ARS may point to approaches that could accelerate the discovery of treatments for both.","Rios, Carmen I; Cassatt, David R; Hollingsworth, Brynn A; Satyamitra, Merriline M; Tadesse, Yeabsera S; Taliaferro, Lanyn P; Winters, Thomas A; DiCarlo, Andrea L",Radiation research,579,20

In contrast, triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that a subset of TNBC critically requires CDK4/6 for proliferation, and yet, these TNBC are resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition due to sequestration of CDK4/6 inhibitors into tumor cell lysosomes. This sequestration is caused by enhanced lysosomal biogenesis and increased lysosomal numbers in TNBC cells. We developed new CDK4/6 inhibitor compounds that evade the lysosomal sequestration and are efficacious against resistant TNBC. We also show that coadministration of lysosomotropic or lysosome-destabilizing compounds (an antibiotic azithromycin, an antidepressant siramesine, an antimalaria compound chloroquine) renders resistant tumor cells sensitive to currently used CDK4/6 inhibitors. Lastly, coinhibition of CDK2 arrested proliferation of CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant cells.

A newer generation of this kit, released in Canada in early 2010, is designed to simplify the procedure and reduce the turnaround time by about 24 h. The assay methodology and targets included in this version of the kit are different; consequently, the objective of this study was to compare the detection of a panel of respiratory viral targets using the older Luminex xTAG RVP (RVP Classic) assay with that using the newer xTAG RVP Fast assay. This study included 334 respiratory specimens that had been characterized for a variety of respiratory viral targets; all samples were tested by both versions of the RVP assay in parallel. Overall, the RVP Classic assay was more sensitive than the RVP Fast assay (88.6% and 77.5% sensitivities, respectively) for all the viral targets combined. Targets not detected by the RVP Fast assay included primarily influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus type 2, and human coronavirus 229E.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTINGS An online, 16-question survey was distributed across several evidence synthesis, health technology assessment and guideline development organisations. We asked the respondents what tools they use and abandon, how often and when they use the tools, their perceived time savings and accuracy, and desired new tools. Descriptive statistics were used to report the results. RESULTS 253 respondents completed the survey; 89% have used systematic review automation tools - most frequently whilst screening (79%). Respondents' 'top 3' tools included: Covidence (45%), RevMan (35%), Rayyan and GRADEPro (both 22%); most commonly abandoned were Rayyan (19%), Covidence (15%), DistillerSR (14%) and RevMan (13%). Tools saved time (80%) and increased accuracy (54%). Respondents taught themselves to how to use the tools (72%); lack of knowledge was the most frequent barrier to tool adoption (51%). New tool development was suggested for the searching and data extraction stages. CONCLUSION Automation tools will likely have an increasingly important role in high-quality and timely reviews. Further work is required in training and dissemination of automation tools and ensuring they meet the desirable features of those conducting systematic reviews.","Scott, Anna Mae; Forbes, Connor; Clark, Justin; Carter, Matt; Glasziou, Paul; Munn, Zachary",Journal of clinical epidemiology,579,28

To better understand human exposure to NNIs, 10 parent compounds, and 6 of their metabolites were analyzed in 408 urine samples collected from 129 healthy adults in Wuhan, Central China, during autumn and winter of 2018. These specimens included repeated urine samples taken in 3 d from 75 volunteers. The urinary concentrations of desnitro-imidacloprid (DN-IMI), imidacloprid-olefin (IMI-olefin), and desmethyl-acetamiprid (DM-ACE) were higher (4-40 times) than those of their parent compounds (IMI and acetamiprid, ACE). DN-IMI and IMI-olefin accounted for 92% of the urinary Σ3IMI (the sum of IMI and its specific metabolites measured). Positive correlations (r) were observed between DN-IMI and IMI (0.50), IMI-olefin and IMI (0.75), and DM-ACE and ACE (0.53). Good to excellent inter-day reliabilities (unadjusted intraclass correlation coefficients) were observed for IMI-olefin (0.61) and DM-ACE (0.81), while moderate inter-day reliability was observed for DN-IMI (0.43). The urinary NNI concentrations were significantly higher in autumn than in winter, and higher in urban areas than in rural areas, while no significant gender or age-related differences were observed. To our knowledge, this is the first report on DN-IMI and IMI-olefin in human urine.","Wang, Aizhen; Mahai, Gaga; Wan, Yanjian; Yang, Zong; He, Zhenyu; Xu, Shunqing; Xia, Wei",Environment international,579,1

METHODS This prospective, multicenter clinical trial enrolled 220 consecutive participants between November 29, 2006, and January 14, 2008, followed by a second cohort of 102 participants between January 14 and June 18, 2008. Enrolled participants had carotid stenosis (symptomatic >50% or asymptomatic >80%). The first 220 subjects underwent distal EPD placement with a new large-diameter filter, and the second cohort of 102 underwent placement of an older EPD that is no longer manufactured. All 322 participants were to be treated with a dedicated carotid stent with a tapered, small, closed-cell design (Xact; Abbott Vascular) and were to be included in the long-term evaluation. Independent neurologic assessment was performed before CAS and at 1 day, 30 days, and annually after CAS. All primary end point events were independently adjudicated by a central committee. RESULTS The periprocedural composite end point of DSMI (95% confidence interval) in the first 220 participants was 2.3% (0.74%, 5.22%), with a combined death and stroke rate of 1.8% (0.50%, 4.59%) and a rate of death and major stroke of 0.5% (0.01%, 2.51%). As of January 3, 2011, the median follow-up for the entire 322-subject cohort for the long-term evaluation was 2.8 years. Freedom from the periprocedural composite of DSMI plus ipsilateral stroke thereafter was 95.4%, with an annualized ipsilateral stroke rate of 0.4%. CONCLUSIONS CAS outcomes in patients at high risk for CEA have improved from earlier carotid stent trials. With periprocedural rates of DSMI of 2.3%, death or stroke at 1.8%, and death or major stroke rate of 0.5%, PROTECT has the lowest rate of periprocedural complications among other comparable single-arm CAS trials in patients at high risk for CEA.","Matsumura, Jon S; Gray, William; Chaturvedi, Seemant; Yamanouchi, Dai; Peng, Lei; Verta, Patrick",Journal of vascular surgery,579,1

(2) To provide a treatment algorithm for care of COVID-19 positive/suspected hip fractures patients that accounts for their increased risk of morbidity and mortality. SETTING One academic medical center including 4 Level 1 trauma centers, 1 university-based tertiary care referral hospital, and 1 orthopaedic specialty hospital. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS One thousand two hundred seventy-eight patients treated for hip fractures between October 2014 and April 2020, including 136 patients treated during the COVID-19 pandemic between February 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020. INTERVENTION The Score for Trauma Triage in the Geriatric and Middle-Aged ORIGINAL (STTGMAORIGINAL) score was modified by adding COVID-19 virus as a risk factor for mortality to create the STTGMACOVID score. Patients were stratified into quartiles to demonstrate differences in risk distribution between the scores. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Inpatient and 30-day mortality, major, and minor complications. RESULTS Both STTGMA score and COVID-19 positive/suspected status are independent predictors of inpatient mortality, confirming their use in risk assessment models for geriatric hip fracture patients. Compared with STTGMAORIGINAL, where COVID-19 patients are haphazardly distributed among the risk groups and COVID-19 inpatient and 30 days mortalities comprise 50% deaths in the minimal-risk and low-risk cohorts, the STTGMACOVID tool is able to triage 100% of COVID-19 patients and 100% of COVID-19 inpatient and 30 days mortalities into the highest risk quartile, where it was demonstrated that these patients have a 55% rate of pneumonia, a 35% rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome, a 22% rate of inpatient mortality, and a 35% rate of 30 days mortality. COVID-19 patients who are symptomatic on presentation to the emergency department and undergo surgical fixation have a 30% inpatient mortality rate compared with 12.5% for patients who are initially asymptomatic but later develop symptoms. CONCLUSION The STTGMA tool can be modified for specific disease processes, in this case to account for the COVID-19 virus and provide a robust risk stratification tool that accounts for a heretofore unknown risk factor. COVID-19 positive/suspected status portends a poor outcome in this susceptible trauma population and should be included in risk assessment models. These patients should be considered a high risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality. Patients with COVID-19 symptoms on presentation should have surgery deferred until symptoms improve or resolve and should be reassessed for surgical treatment versus definitive nonoperative treatment with palliative care and/or hospice care.

These techniques began with transanal endoluminal surgical removal of rectal masses and have progressed to transanal radical proctectomy for rectal cancer. The first transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) was performed in 2009 by Sylla, Rattner, Delgado, and Lacy. The improved visibility and working space associated with the taTME technique is intriguing. This video manuscript outlines the training pathway followed by pioneers in the taTME technique, the process of implementation into clinical practice, and initial case report. METHODS A double board-certified colorectal surgeon with expertise in rectal cancer, minimally invasive total mesorectal excision, transanal endoscopic surgery (TES), and intersphincteric dissection, underwent taTME training in male cadaver models. Institutional review board (IRB) approval for a phase I clinical trial was achieved. The entire operative team including surgeons, nurses, and operative staff underwent taTME cadaver training the day prior to the first clinical case. The case was proctored by an expert in taTME. RESULTS A 66-year-old male with uT3N1M0 rectal cancer located in the posterior distal rectum, underwent taTME with laparoscopic abdominal assistance, hand sewn coloanal anastomosis, and diverting loop ileostomy. The majority of the TME was performed transanally with laparoscopic assistance for exposure, splenic flexure mobilization, and high ligation of the vascular pedicles. Operative time was 359 min. There were no intraoperative complications. Pathology revealed a ypT2N1 moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma, grade I TME, 1 cm circumferential radial margin, and 2/13 positive lymph nodes. CONCLUSION Implementation of taTME into practice can be achieved by surgeons with expertise in minimally invasive TME, TES, pre-clinical taTME training in cadavers, case observation, proctoring, and ongoing mentorship.

This manuscript reports on the systemic benefits of restoring and achieving dopamine homeostasis to reverse and normalize thoughts and behaviors of Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) dysfunctional conditions and their effects on behavioral physiology; function of reward genes; and focuses on digestive, immune, eye health, and the constellation of symptomatic behaviors. The role of nutrigenomic interventions on restoring normal brain functions and its benefits on these systems will be discussed. We demonstrate that modulation of dopamine homeostasis using nutrigenomic dopamine agonists, instead of pharmaceutical interventions, is achievable. The allied interlinking with diverse chronic diseases and disorders, roles of free radicals and incidence of anaerobic events have been extensively highlighted. In conjunction, the role of dopamine in aspects of sleep, rapid eye movement and waking are extensively discussed. The integral aspects of food indulgence, the influence of taste sensations, and gut-brain signaling are also discussed along with a special emphasis on ocular health. The detailed mechanistic insight of dopamine, immune competence and the allied aspects of autoimmune disorders are also highlighted. Finally, the integration of dopamine homeostasis utilizing a patented gene test and a research-validated nutrigenomic intervention are presented. Overall, a cutting-edge nutrigenomic intervention could prove to be a technological paradigm shift in our understanding of the extent to which achieving dopamine homeostasis will benefit overall health.","Downs, B W; Blum, K; Bagchi, D; Kushner, S; Bagchi, M; Galvin, J M; Lewis, McG; Siwicki, D; Brewer, R; Boyett, B; Baron, D; Giordano, J; Badgaiyan, R D",Journal of systems and integrative neuroscience,579,12

The nature of autoregulation dysfunction in these conditions is unclear. We therefore evaluated autoregulation in 30 patients with preeclampsia, 30 patients with CHTN, and 20 patients with GHTN and compared them with a control group of 30 normal pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN The autoregulatory index (ARI) was calculated with the use of simultaneously recorded cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (transcranial Doppler ultrasound), blood pressure (noninvasive arterial volume clamping), and end-tidal carbon dioxide during a 7-minute period of rest. ARI values of 0 and 9 indicate absent and perfect autoregulation, respectively. We use analysis of variance with Bonferroni test vs a control group. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. RESULTS ARI was significantly reduced in preeclampsia (ARI, 5.5 ± 1.6; P = .002) and CHTN (ARI, 5.6 ± 1.7; P = .004), but not in GHTN (ARI, 6.7 ± 0.8; P = 1.0) when compared with control subjects (ARI, 6.7 ± 0.8). ARI was more decreased in patients with CHTN who subsequently experienced preeclampsia than in those who did not (ARI, 3.9 ± 1.9 vs 6.1 ± 1.2; P = .001). This was not true for women with GHTN or control subjects who later experienced preeclampsia. CONCLUSION Pregnant women with CHTN or preeclampsia (even after exclusion of superimposed preeclampsia) have impaired autoregulation when compared with women with GHTN or normal pregnancy. Whether the decreased ARI in patients with CHTN who later experience preeclampsia is due to preexistent differences or early affected cerebral circulation remains to be determined.","van Veen, Teelkien R; Panerai, Ronney B; Haeri, Sina; Singh, Jasbir; Adusumalli, Jasvant A; Zeeman, Gerda G; Belfort, Michael A",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,579,17

Acute occurrences, however, may still require further development and investigation and therefore we studied acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The efficacy of endovascular procedures such as mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for the treatment of large vessel occlusion (LVO), can be improved by testing the performance of thrombectomy devices and techniques using patient specific 3D printed neurovascular models. METHODS 3D printed phantoms were connected to a flow loop with physiologically relevant flow conditions, including input flow rate and fluid temperature. A simulated blood clot was introduced into the model and placed in the proximal Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) region. Clot location, composition, length, and arterial angulation were varied and MTs were simulated using stent retrievers. Device placement relative to the clot and the outcome of the thrombectomy were recorded for each situation. Digital subtraction angiograms (DSA) were captured before and after LVO simulation. Recanalization outcome was evaluated using DSA as either 'no recanalization' or 'recanalization'. Forty-two 3DP neurovascular phantom benchtop experiments were performed. RESULTS Clot angulation within the MCA region had the most significant impact on the MT outcome, with a p-value of 0.016. Other factors such as clot location, clot composition, and clot length correlated weakly with the MT outcome. CONCLUSIONS This project allowed us to gain knowledge of how such characteristics influence thrombectomy success and can be used in making clinical decisions when planning the procedure and selecting specific thrombectomy tools and approaches.","Sommer, Kelsey N; Bhurwani, Mohammad Mahdi Shiraz; Tutino, Vincent; Siddiqui, Adnan; Davies, Jason; Snyder, Kenneth; Levy, Elad; Mokin, Maxim; Ionita, Ciprian N",3D printing in medicine,579,6

Few studies examine the accuracy of paramedic performed FAST examinations. The duration of an ultrasound training program remains controversial. This study's purpose was to assess the accuracy of paramedic FAST exam interpretation following a one hour didactic training session. METHODS The interpretation of paramedic performed FAST exams was compared to the interpretation of physician performed FAST examinations on a mannequin model containing 300ml of free fluid following a one hour didactic training course. Results were compared using the Chi-square test. Differences in accuracy rate were deemed significant if p < 0.05. RESULTS Fourteen critical care flight paramedics and four emergency physicians were voluntarily recruited. The critical care paramedics were mostly ultrasound-naive whereas the emergency physicians all had ultrasound training. The correct interpretation of FAST scans was comparable between the two groups with accuracy of 85.6% and 87.5% (∆1.79 95%CI -33.85 to 21.82, p = 0.90) for paramedics and emergency physicians respectively. CONCLUSIONS This study determined that critical care paramedics were able to use ultrasound to detect free fluid on a simulated mannequin model and interpret the FAST exam with a similar accuracy as experienced emergency physicians following a one hour training course. This suggests the potential use of prehospital ultrasound to aid in the triage and transport decisions of trauma patients while limiting the financial and logistical burden of ultrasound training.","Waterman, Bradley; Van Aarsen, Kristine; Lewell, Michael; Tien, Homer; Myslik, Frank; Peddle, Michael; Doran, Sean",CJEM,579,7

In concert, these domains facilitate dynamic virion attachment to cell-surface sialoglycans. Most HEs (type I) target 9-O-acetylated sialic acids (9-O-Ac-Sias), but one group of coronaviruses switched to using 4-O-Ac-Sias instead (type II). This specificity shift required quasisynchronous adaptations in the Sia-binding sites of both lectin and esterase domains. Previously, a partially disordered crystal structure of a type II HE revealed how the shift in lectin ligand specificity was achieved. How the switch in esterase substrate specificity was realized remained unresolved, however. Here, we present a complete structure of a type II HE with a receptor analog in the catalytic site and identify the mutations underlying the 9-O- to 4-O-Ac-Sia substrate switch. We show that (i) common principles pertaining to the stereochemistry of protein-carbohydrate interactions were at the core of the transition in lectin ligand and esterase substrate specificity; (ii) in consequence, the switch in O-Ac-Sia specificity could be readily accomplished via convergent intramolecular coevolution with only modest architectural changes in lectin and esterase domains; and (iii) a single, inconspicuous Ala-to-Ser substitution in the catalytic site was key to the emergence of the type II HEs.

As the main site of APP synthesis the liver is constantly exposed to antigens or pathogens via blood flow, but also to systemic inflammatory signals originating either from the splanchnic area or from the circulation. Under both homeostatic and acute-phase response (APR) conditions the composition of APP's is determined by the pattern of regulatory mediators derived from the systemic circulation or from local cell populations, especially liver macrophages.

Analyses by qRT- PCR indicated that a combination of rHCVcp/ TSE with oil body induced high levels of IL-10 cytokines compared to that of the FA adjuvant. These characteristics are important properties for the design of an HCV vaccine candidate and indicate the potential of Canola-derived antigen and oil bodies in addressing these concerns.","Mohammadzadeh, Sara; Roohvand, Farzin; Ehsani, Parastoo; Hatef Salmanian, Ali; Ajdary, Soheila","APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",579,16

We tested how different types of seizures affect baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and heart rate variability (HRV). We hypothesized that BRS and HRV would be reduced after bilateral convulsive seizures (BCS). Methods: We recorded blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram (ECG) and oxygen saturation continuously in patients (n = 18) with intractable epilepsy undergoing video-EEG monitoring. A total of 23 seizures, either focal seizures (FS, n = 14) or BCS (n = 9), were analyzed from these patients. We used 5 different HRV measurements in both the time and frequency domains to study HRV in pre- and post-ictal states. We used the average frequency domain gain, computed as the average of the magnitude ratio between the systolic BP (BPsys) and the RR-interval time series, in the low-frequency (LF) band as frequency domain index of BRS in addition to the instantaneous slope between systolic BP and RR-interval satisfying spontaneous BRS criteria as a time domain index of BRS. Results: Overall, the post-ictal modulation of HRV varied across the subjects but not specifically by the type of seizures. Comparing pre- to post-ictal epochs, the LF power of BRS decreased in 8 of 9 seizures for patients with BCS; whereas following 12 of 14 FS, BRS increased. Similarly, spontaneous BRS decreased following 7 of 9 BCS. The presence or absence of oxygen desaturation was not consistent with the changes in BRS following seizures, and the HRV does not appear to be correlated with the BRS changes. These data suggest that a transient decrease in BRS and temporary loss of cardiovascular homeostatic control can follow BCS but is unlikely following FS. Significance: These findings indicate significant post-ictal autonomic dysregulation in patients with epilepsy following BCS. Further, reduced BRS following BCS, if confirmed in future studies on SUDEP cases, may indicate one quantifiable risk marker of SUDEP.","Esmaeili, Behnaz; Kaffashi, Farhad; Theeranaew, Wanchat; Dabir, Aman; Lhatoo, Samden D; Loparo, Kenneth A",Frontiers in neurology,579,5

Guidelines recommend interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) as first line screening method for the general population. Studies provided conflicting evidence on IGRA and tuberculin skin test (TST) performance in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. We assessed test concordance and the effects of immunosuppression on their performance in IBD patients. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases (2011-2018) for studies testing TST and IGRA in IBD. Primary outcome was TST and IGRA concordance. Secondary outcomes were effects of immunosuppressive therapy on performance. Immunosuppression defined as either steroids, thiopurine, methotrexate or cyclosporine use. We used the pooled random effects model to adjust for heterogeneity analyzed using (I2-Q statistics). We compared the fixed model to exclude smaller study effects. Results Sixteen studies (2,488 patients) were included. Pooled TST and IGRA concordance was 85% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81%-88%; P=0.01). Effects of immunosuppression were reported in 8 studies (814 patients). The odds ratio of testing positive by IGRA decreased to 0.57 if immunosuppressed (95% CI, 0.31-1.03; P=0.06). The odds ratio of testing positive by TST if immunosuppressed was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.61-2.12; P=0.69). The fixed model yielded similar results, however the negative effect of immunosuppression on IGRA reached statistical significance (P=0.01). Conclusions While concordance was 85% between TST and IGRA, the performance of IGRA seems to be negatively affected by immunosuppression. Given the importance of detecting latent tuberculosis prior to anti-TNF initiation, further randomized controlled trials comparing the performance of TST and IGRA in IBD patients are needed.","Alrajhi, Saad; Germain, Pascale; Martel, Myriam; Lakatos, Peter; Bessissow, Talat; Al-Taweel, Talal; Afif, Waqqas",Intestinal research,579,1

METHODS We screened for RIAC among 1248 infants with a gestational age ≥36 weeks using our established method with cranial ultrasound, SpO2 monitoring, and polygraphy. We classified the infants into three groups: symmetric IUGR, asymmetric IUGR, and control. We compared the perinatal factors with the incidence of RIAC and feeding hypoxemia among the three groups. RESULTS Overall, 26 infants had symmetric IUGR, 143 infants had asymmetric IUGR, and 1079 infants were in the control group. RIAC was observed in 10 (6.9%) infants in the asymmetric IUGR group and in 37 (3.4%) infants in the control group. Feeding hypoxemia was observed in 15 (10.5%) infants in the asymmetric IUGR group and in 52 (4.8%) infants in the control group. The incidence of RIAC and feeding hypoxemia in the asymmetric IUGR group was significantly more than that in the control group. None of the infants with symmetric IUGR exhibited RIAC or feeding hypoxemia. CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that asymmetric IUGR is a risk factor for RIAC and feeding hypoxemia. These infants should be aggressively screened for RIAC.","Minowa, Hideki; Mima, Aya; Ikeda, Yuka; Yasuhara, Hajime; Ebisu, Reiko; Ohgitani, Ayako","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",579,7

Despite clear interventions to reduce these infections, their impact on preventing stillbirths is unclear, with conflicting evidence. AREAS COVERED The purpose of this review is to discuss data regarding infectious causes of stillbirths, and interventions for the prevention and/or treatment of these infections. We discuss the limitations in evaluating the true effect of the interventions on stillbirths, and highlight the importance of preventing infections in the grand scheme of improving maternal and infant pregnancy outcomes. We used PubMed to identify relevant studies, reviews, and meta-analysis until January 2021. EXPERT OPINION Maternal infections during pregnancy, especially malaria and syphilis, are notable causes of stillbirth in low- and middle-income countries. Despite considerable global advocacy, there is scant recognition of the potential to reduce the burden of antepartum stillbirths related to infections. Reducing stillbirths overall must become an important indicator for quality of care and accountability, and progress must also be assessed by coverage of key interventions that impact stillbirths, which includes population-based screening, prevention and timely treatment of infections during pregnancy.","Aleem, Samia; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,579,16

Satellite measurements of long-term CO2 data with global coverage improve our understanding of global carbon cycles. However, the sensitivity of the space-borne measurements to anthropogenic emissions on a regional scale is less explored because of data sparsity in space and time caused by impacts from geophysical factors such as aerosols and clouds. Here, we used global land mapping column averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2) data (Mapping-XCO2), generated from a spatio-temporal geostatistical method using GOSAT and OCO-2 observations from April 2009 to December 2020, to investigate the responses of XCO2 to anthropogenic emissions at both global and regional scales. Our results show that the long-term trend of global XCO2 growth rate from Mapping-XCO2, which is consistent with that from ground observations, shows interannual variations caused by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The spatial distributions of XCO2 anomalies, derived from removing background from the Mapping-XCO2 data, reveal XCO2 enhancements of about 1.5–3.5 ppm due to anthropogenic emissions and seasonal biomass burning in the wintertime. Furthermore, a clustering analysis applied to seasonal XCO2 clearly reveals the spatial patterns of atmospheric transport and terrestrial biosphere CO2 fluxes, which help better understand and analyze regional XCO2 changes that are associated with atmospheric transport. To quantify regional anomalies of CO2 emissions, we selected three representative urban agglomerations as our study areas, including the Beijing-Tian-Hebei region (BTH), the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomerations (YRD), and the high-density urban areas in the eastern USA (EUSA). The results show that the XCO2 anomalies in winter well capture the several-ppm enhancement due to anthropogenic CO2 emissions. For BTH, YRD, and EUSA, regional positive anomalies of 2.47 ± 0.37 ppm, 2.20 ± 0.36 ppm, and 1.38 ± 0.33 ppm, respectively, can be detected during winter months from 2009 to 2020. These anomalies are slightly higher than model simulations from CarbonTracker-CO2. In addition, we compared the variations in regional XCO2 anomalies and NO2 columns during the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic from January to March 2020. Interestingly, the results demonstrate that the variations of XCO2 anomalies have a positive correlation with the decline of NO2 columns during this period. These correlations, moreover, are associated with the features of emitting sources. These results suggest that we can use simultaneously observed NO2, because of its high detectivity and co-emission with CO2, to assist the analysis and verification of CO2 emissions in future studies.","Sheng, Mengya Lei Liping Zeng Zhao-Cheng Rao Weiqiang Zhang Shaoqing",Remote Sensing,579,1

Also in COVID-19 pandemic, we need to maintain social distancing while taking examination offline. So, this paper proposes system that can help examinees in knowing their seat number in their respective examination hall with the help of online Web portal. It can help in eliminating the crowd at the notice board and can also save their time. With the help of an admit card generated to which a barcode be attached, an examinee can scan that code each day and know their seating location as per a daily basis. Another system is also proposed for face recognition that can help the examiner in identifying the identity of candidates that can also alert them if they are not found in the database using deep learning. Within the examination hall, the orientation of the head and movement of the mouth of an examinee provide us the clue of suspicious behaviors. Nowadays, most of the suspicious behaviors monitoring procedures are done manually that involves a lot of invigilators in each examination hall. In the pandemic situation, we proposed an intelligent invigilation using video surveillance that can autonomously detect and track examinee’s eye gaze, head orientation, and mouth movement to robustly detect their cheating activities. Algorithms which are implemented independently include eigen-face, fisherface, and linear binary pattern histograms. With the help of webcam installed at each examinee’s desk, if any suspicious activity is detected, the system will generate an alarm indicating such behaviors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Sakya, G.; Singh, S.; Mishra, S.; Tiwari, S.

Transparent barriers are an engineering control that are utilized to intercept air traveling between customers to workers. Information on the effectiveness of these barriers against aerosols is limited. In this study, a cough simulator was used to represent a cough from a customer. Two optical particle counters were used (one on each side of the barrier, labeled reference and worker) to determine the number of particles that migrated around a transparent barrier. Nine barrier sizes and a no barrier configuration were tested with six replicates each. Tests of these 10 configurations were conducted for both sitting and standing scenarios to represent configurations common to nail salons and grocery stores, respectively. Barrier efficiency was calculated using a ratio of the particle count results (reference/worker). Barriers had better efficiency when they were 9 to 39 cm (3.5 to 15.5 inches) above cough height and at least 91 cm (36 inches) wide, 92% and 93% respectively. Barriers that were 91 cm (36 inches) above table height for both scenarios blocked 71% or more of the particles between 0.35-0.725 {micro}m and 68% for particles between 1 to 3 {micro}m.

Variation in the TMPRSS2 gene may account for the difference in population disease susceptibility. The haplotype-based genetic sharing and structure of TMPRSS2 among global populations have not been studied so far. Therefore, in the present work, we used this approach with a focus on South Asia to study the haplotypes and their sharing among various populations worldwide. We have used next-generation sequencing data of 393 individuals and analysed the TMPRSS2 gene. Our analysis of genetic relatedness for this gene showed a closer affinity of South Asians with the West Eurasian populations therefore, host disease susceptibility and severity particularly in the context of TMPRSS2 will be more akin to West Eurasian instead of East Eurasian. This is in contrast to our prior study on ACE2 gene which shows South Asian haplotypes have a strong affinity towards West Eurasians. Thus ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have an antagonistic genetic relatedness among South Asians. We have also tested the SNP’s frequencies of this gene among various Indian state populations with respect to the case fatality rate. Interestingly, we found a significant positive association between the rs2070788 SNP (G Allele) and the case fatality rate in India. It has been shown that the GG genotype of rs2070788 allele tends to have a higher expression of TMPRSS2 in the lung compared to the AG and AA genotypes, thus it might play a vital part in determining differential disease vulnerability. We trust that this information will be useful in underscoring the role of the TMPRSS2 variant in COVID-19 susceptibility and using it as a biomarker may help to predict populations at risk.","Pandey, Rudra Kumar; Srivastava, Anshika; Singh, Prajjval Pratap; Chaubey, Gyaneshwer",bioRxiv,579,1

These measurements are made possible owing to the use of a gas pixel detector (GPD) at the focus of three X-ray telescopes. The GPD allows simultaneous measurements of the interaction point, energy, arrival time, and polarization angle of detected X-ray photons. The increase in sensitivity, achieved 40 years ago, for imaging and spectroscopy with the Einstein satellite will thus be extended to X-ray polarimetry for the first time. The characteristics of gas multiplication detectors are subject to changes over time. Because the GPD is a novel instrument, it is particularly important to verify its performance and stability during its mission lifetime. For this purpose, the spacecraft hosts a filter and calibration set (FCS), which includes both polarized and unpolarized calibration sources for performing in-flight calibration of the instruments. In this study, we present the design of the flight models of the FCS and the first measurements obtained using silicon drift detectors and CCD cameras, as well as those obtained in thermal vacuum with the flight units of the GPD. We show that the calibration sources successfully assess and verify the functionality of the GPD and validate its scientific results in orbit; this improves our knowledge of the behavior of these detectors in X-ray polarimetry.","Ferrazzoli, Riccardo; Muleri, Fabio; Lefevre, Carlo; Morbidini, Alfredo; Amici, Fabrizio; Brienza, Daniele; Costa, Enrico; Monte, Ettore Del; Marco, Alessandro Di; Persio, Giuseppe Di; Donnarumma, Immacolata; Fabiani, Sergio; Monaca, Fabio La; Loffredo, Pasqualino; Maiolo, Luca; Maita, Francesco; Piazzolla, Raffaele; Ramsey, Brian; Rankin, John; Ratheesh, Ajay; Rubini, Alda; Sarra, Paolo; Soffitta, Paolo; Tobia, Antonino; Xie, Fei",,579,33

Similarly, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is causing severe, sometimes fatal, respiratory disease in calves. Both viruses are pneumovirus and the infections with human respiratory syncytial virus and BRSV have similar clinical, pathological, and epidemiological characteristics. In this study we used experimental BRSV infection in calves as a model of respiratory syncytial virus infection to demonstrate important aspects of viral replication and clearance in a natural target animal. Replication of BRSV was demonstrated in the luminal part of the respiratory epithelial cells and replication in the upper respiratory tract preceded the replication in the lower respiratory tract. Virus excreted to the lumen of the respiratory tract was cleared by neutrophils whereas apoptosis was an important way of clearance of BRSV-infected epithelial cells. Neighboring cells, which probably were epithelial cells, phagocytized the BRSV-infected apoptotic cells. The number of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased during the course of infection, but the T cells were not found between the epithelial cells of the bronchi up until apoptosis was no longer detected, thus in the bronchi there was no indication of direct contact-dependent T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity in the primary infection.","Viuff, Birgitte; Tjørnehøj, Kirsten; Larsen, Lars E.; Røntved, Christine M.; Uttenthal, Åse; Rønsholt, Leif; Alexandersen, Soren",The American Journal of Pathology,579,16

These include: using predominantly percentages when communicating the absolute risk, but also providing (for balance) a format which conveys a higher perception of risk (expected frequency out of 10,000); using a visual linear scale cut at an appropriate point to illustrate the maximum risk, explained through an illustrative persona who might face that highest level of risk; and providing context to the absolute risk through presenting a range of other personas illustrating people who would face risks of a wide range of different levels. These personas should have their major risk factors (age, existing health conditions) described. By contrast, giving people absolute likelihoods of other risks they face in an attempt to add context was considered less helpful.","Freeman, Alexandra LJ; Kerr, John; Recchia, Gabriel; Schneider, Claudia; Lawrence, Alice CE; Finikarides, Leila; Luoni, Giulia; Dryhurst, Sarah; Spiegelhalter, David J",,579,24

Screening measures including SARS-CoV-2 polymerase-chain reaction (CovPCR) testing prior to invasive procedures, therapy administration, were instituted to address risk of spread from asymptomatic (AS) pts. Studies have documented poor outcomes with COVID-19 in cancer pts with rate of AS COVID-19 ranging from 0.6%- 8%. (Liang et.al, 2020;Al-Shamsi, et.al, 2020, Shah et.al. 2020). In the general population, rates of AS cases was estimated to be 17% (Byambasuren, O., 2020). This study aimed to examine the incidence and characteristics of AS COVID -19 in cancer pts, and determine its effect on cancer care delivery at a tertiary care center. Methods: With IRB approval, a retrospective chart review was conducted on cancer pts undergoing CoVPCR screening. Pts were considered AS if they had no recent fever (≥100.5 °F), cough, headache, loss of taste/smell, shortness of breath, diarrhea, or high risk exposure. This analysis compared cases (positive CoVPCR) identified by screening of AS pts to control (negative CoVPCR) pts (matched by planned procedure type and month of screening). Each COVID case was matched to 2 negative controls on month and planned procedure type. Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared between cases and controls using conditional logistic regression or Mantel-Haenszel tests. Results: Between 03/2020 and 09/2020, 4143 AS pts underwent CovPCR testing and 75 were chosen for analysis (25 cases;50 controls). The incidence of AS COVID-19 in cancer pts was 0.6% (25/4143). Median age was lower in the cases (64 vs 70y, p = 0.04). Gender, race, primary cancer diagnosis, and co-morbidity distribution was similar between cases and controls. Of the cases, 10 pts (40%) never underwent the planned oncologic intervention while 11 (44%) had a delay related to the positive CoVPCR (2 pts had no intervention planned). Only 1 pt (2%) in control arm didn't undergo the planned procedure. The mean duration of delay was 18 days (range 0-49 days, SD 16.72) in cases versus Zero days in control. Four (16.7%) cases developed symptoms within 14 days of positive CoVPCR testing but the PCR value did not predict this conversion. Conclusions: Incidence of AS COVID in our cancer pts was significantly lower than general population. Active screening delayed oncologic care but with institution of safety measures like separate treatment rooms and scheduling procedures at the end of the day have ensured safe and prompt cancer care delivery during the pandemic. Future research needs will address incorporating vaccination status into the screening algorithm to limit widespread CoVPCR screening, thus improving care delivery and cost effectiveness.","Ross, N.; Handorf, E.

In this regard, the role of media as an information channel in delivering the reliable information and motivating the active participation of citizens in complying with government's preventive actions becomes much more important. In this study, the role of online news and social media on people's preventive actions considering the role of trust in citizens and government from the perspective of social capital is investigated. For the empirical study, a structural equation modeling is employed by using survey material gathered from South Korea in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. South Korea was selected as its COVID-19 prevention strategy focused not only on the provision of medical support, but also on the enhancement of social trust through active engagement with people through media channels. Our results reveal that the perceived characteristics of online news and social media influence preventive actions through the trust in citizens or in government. In addition, while online news media enhances trust in both the citizens and the government, social media only influences trust in citizens. Based on our findings, the role of media in preventing the spread of COVID-19 is dicussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Lee, J.; Kim, K.; Park, G.; Cha, N.",Telematics and Informatics,579,4

Effective strategies for climate adaptation and development depend on understanding these differential sensitivities to climatic variability. This study focuses on a vulnerable population living in forest-fringe villages of central India, where seasonal migration is a common livelihood strategy for poor households to supplement their incomes with remittances. We quantify the relative sensitivity of a decision to migrate for the first time to climate and socio-economic variables and how the sensitivities vary for different segments of the population. We surveyed 5000 households in 500 forest-fringe villages to identify patterns of migration from 2013 to 2017. Using a mixed-effects logistic regression model, we predicted the probability of first-time migration of a household member based on climate variables and household- and district-level characteristics. We find that households in more agricultural and prosperous districts experience lower rates of migration but are more sensitive to climatic variability than households in poorer districts. The probability of first-time migration from a household in the most prosperous district increases by approximately 40% with one standard deviation in mean maximum temperature or rainfall from the 1981-2017 mean. However, the probability of migration does not vary as a function of climatic variability for households in the poorest district. We attribute this difference in sensitivities to the greater dependence on agriculture and irrigation in more prosperous districts and poverty-driven dependence on migration regardless of the climate in poorer districts. Households investing remittances from migration in agricultural intensification could become increasingly sensitive to climate variability, particularly with water shortages and projected increases in climate variability in the region. Promotion of non-agricultural livelihood options and climate-resilient agriculture could the reduce sensitivity of migration to climate variability in the study region.","Choksi, P.; Singh, D.; Singh, J.; Mondal, P.; Nagendra, H.; Urpelainen, J.; DeFries, R.",Environmental Research Letters,579,25

Recent institutional reforms, such as states changing remittance rules for the sales and use tax following the Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, were enacted to increase tax revenue collections and create a more neutral tax system. Although these reforms induced more remote vendors to remit taxes on a destination basis, the revenue gains were modest, consistent with most large online vendors remitting taxes prior to the reforms. Instead, following the recent large shock to online shopping from the COVID-19 pandemic, the shift to destination-based taxation has redistributed revenues between large and small local jurisdictions. Increased online shopping raises revenue growth in small jurisdictions while contracting revenues in large jurisdictions. But Wayfair is not the end of the story: technological changes that induce new consumption patterns promise new challenges for fiscal authorities. Critical challenges for the next decades include limiting administrative and compliance costs of enforcing taxes in a digital world, determining filing thresholds, dealing with online marketplaces and facilitators, and taxing the consumption of digital services from two-sided platforms. With respect to digital services, we discuss whether consumption taxes should be imposed on both monetized platforms and nonmonetized platforms, such as social media, and the mechanisms for doing so.","Agrawal, D.

Methods: Using a test-negative case-control design, information on vaccination status of cases with Covid-19 among healthcare workers in our institution in Puducherry, India, and an equal number of matched controls, i.e. positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, was obtained. The cases and controls were matched for age ({+/-} 3 years) and date of testing ({+/-} 3 days). The groups were compared using multivariable conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR), with adjustment for gender, occupational role, presence of symptoms and presence of a comorbidity condition. Per cent vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as 100x(1-adjusted odds ratio). Results: Using data from 360 case-control pairs, VE of one dose and of two doses, in providing protection against Covid-19 was 49% (95% CI: 17%-68%) and 54% (27%-71%), respectively. In view of a difference in the proportion of cases and controls who had symptoms, a separate analysis of data from 203 pairs where both the case and the control had symptoms was done, which showed, VE of 58% (28%-75%) and 64% (38%-78%) after one dose and two doses, respectively. Among cases with moderately severe disease that required oxygen therapy, VE following any number of vaccine doses was 95% (44%-100%).

In addition, for antibody therapies and vaccines that target the spike protein, it’s unclear if these reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or spike protein multiorgan tropism equally. We used fluorescently labeled spike protein near infrared fluorescence to study viral behavior, using an in vivo dynamic imaging system, in young mice. We found a spike protein body-wide biodistribution followed by a slow regional elimination, except for the liver, which showed an accumulation. Spike protein uptake was highest for the lungs, and this was followed by kidney, heart and liver, but, unlike the choroid plexus, it was not detected in the brain parenchyma or cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, the brain vascular barriers were effective in restricting the entry of spike protein into brain parenchyma in young healthy mice. While both anti-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and anti-spike protein antibodies suppressed spike protein biodistribution and organ uptake, anti-spike protein antibody was more effective. By extension, our data support the efficacy of these antibodies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 biodistribution kinetics and multiorgan tropism that could determine coronavirus 19 organ-specific outcomes.","Brady, Molly; Combs, Abigail; Venkatraman, Chethana; Solorzano, Alexander; Johnson, Angelique; McQuaid, Conor; Rahman, Akib; Leyva, Hannah; Edmund Kwok, Wing-Chi; Wood, Ronald W; Deane, Rashid",bioRxiv,579,1

This project invites and assists participants in developing their awareness systems for COVID-19. The system comes with a set up consisting of standard information and the necessary coding explained to the participant. The findings are open and shared through an honor system. The awareness system consists of four embedded subsystems known as diagnostics systems, simulation, tracing, and pattern-matching systems. The diagnostic system uses inference rules to generate an outcome by diseases with the same symptoms related to COVID-19. The skeleton for the simulation system works as a game, depicting how the virus enters and interacts with the body's cells with different four scenarios such as involved in defeating the body's cell, defeating the virus, neutral coexistence of the virus and enclosure, and at best, turning into a positive virus. At that stage of defeating the body's cell, the virus will replicate itself by an assigned degree with a recursive behavior. The tracing system traces the COVID19 and the participant's health using red, green, and blue (RGB) colors. The combination of RGB creates more than 16 million using 24 bits in binary or hexadecimal. The red color reserves for COVID-19, with 16 shades of red for a symptom with a 16 degree of severity.

International virus imports into the study area were captured at the facilities of Chasimba, Matsangoni, Mtondia, and Mavueni, while all four exports from the region were captured from the Chasimba facility, all occurring to Africa destinations. A strong spatial clustering of virus strains at all locations was observed associated with local evolution. Our study shows that influenza A(H3N2) virus epidemics in local populations appear to be characterized by limited introductions followed by significant local spread and evolution.","Owuor, D.

Consider two examples: (a) a highly detrimental misconception surrounding the current pandemic—that COVID-19 is like the common flu—is based on the similarity of the visible symptoms;(b) people think mushrooms are more closely related to plants than to animals because mushrooms and plants both grow in the ground. Our research asked whether it is possible to combat misconceptions using compelling visual representations. Previous research found that the Gestalt principles of perceptual grouping affect reasoning with evolutionary trees. We explored the potential of designing such trees as a “myth buster” tool to target biological misconceptions. More specifically, we tested the hypothesis that students would judge misconception-based inferences to be weaker when the perceptual grouping of the branches looked less consistent, as opposed to more consistent, with the misconception. The results showed that our manipulation of perceptual grouping affected students’ propensity to make inferences consistent with their misconceptions, in the direction predicted, for six separate misconceptions. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Liu, J.; Novick, L.

This results in overall poorer population health for minoritized people. In 2020, Black and Hispanic/Latinx communities throughout the United States, including the state of Illinois, experienced disproportionately high rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Public health officials in Illinois implemented targeted programs at state and local levels to increase intervention access and reduce disparities. METHODS: To quantify how disparities in COVID outcomes evolved through the epidemic, data on SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests, COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19 deaths were obtained from the Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System for the period from March 1 to December 31, 2020. Relative risks of COVID-19 cases and deaths were calculated for Black and Hispanic/Latinx vs. White residents, stratified by age group and epidemic interval. Deaths attributable to racial/ethnic disparities in incidence and case fatality were estimated with counterfactual simulations. RESULTS: Disparities in case and death rates became less drastic after May 2020, but did not disappear, and were more pronounced at younger ages. From March to May of 2020, the risk of a COVID-19 case for Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations was more than twice that of Whites across all age groups. The relative risk of COVID-19 death reached above 10 for Black and Hispanic/Latinx individuals under 50 years of age compared to age-matched Whites in the early epidemic. In all Illinois counties, relative risk of a COVID-19 case was the same or significantly increased for minoritized populations compared to the White population. 79.3% and 86.7% of disparities in deaths among Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations, respectively, were attributable to differences in age-adjusted incidence compared to White populations rather than differences in case fatality ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Racial and ethnic disparities in the COVID-19 pandemic are products of society, not biology. Considering age and geography in addition to race/ethnicity can help to identify the structural factors driving poorer outcomes for certain groups. Studies and policies aimed at reducing inequalities in disease exposure will reduce disparities in mortality more than those focused on drivers of case fatality.","Holden, T. M.; Simon, M.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyze the relationship between social media and stock market trends during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of social theory and Baudrillard's simulacra and hyperreality theory. The authors conducted the data analysis in two phases: the emotional and Granger correlation analysis by using the KPI6 software to analyze 3,275,588 tweets for the predominant emotion on each day and observe its relationship with the stock market. Findings: The research results show a significant Granger causality relation between tweets on a particular day and the closing price of the FTSE MIB during the first phase of the COVID-19 epidemic. The results highlight a strong relationship between social media hyperreality and the real world. The study confirms the role of social media in predicting stock market volatility. Research limitations/implications: The findings have theoretical and practical implications as they reveal the relevance of social media in our society and its relationship with businesses and economies. In an emergency, social media, as an expression of users' feelings and emotions, can generate a state of hyperreality that is strong correlated with reality. Since social media allows users to publish and share messages without any filter and mediation, the hyperreality generated is affected by highly subjective elements. Originality/value: This research is different from the previous ones on the same topic because unlike previous studies, conducted under normal or simulated scenarios, this study is focused on the first phase of an unpredictable and unforeseen emergency event: the COVID-19 pandemic. This research adopts a multidisciplinary approach and integrates previous studies on the economic and financial effects generated by social media by applying well-known theories to a new and unexplored context.

Place and Duration of Study: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Riyadh city, the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, during the national lockdown, between July 2020 and December 2020. Methodology: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A questionnaire composed of a total of 40 questions, which include socio-demographic, knowledge, attitude, and practice questions. According to the responses, a scale has been established in order to categorize the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice towards social distancing and COVID-19 into three categories;good, fair, and poor. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Independent t-test were used to determine the differences between categories. Multivariable linear regression analysis and Pearson's correlation were performed in order to identify factors related to KAP. Results: This study included 407 participants;more than half of them (54%) were females, while (46%) were males. All participants were 18 years and above.

In an attempt to understand the demand and main drivers of telemedicine abortion, we analysed the requests that Women on Web (WoW), an online telemedicine abortion service operating worldwide, received from France throughout 2020. Methods: We conducted a parallel convergent mixed-method study among 809 consultations received from France at WoW between 1 January and 31 December 2020. We performed a cross-sectional study of data obtained from the WoW consultation survey and a manifest content analysis of anonymised email correspondence of 140 women consulting with WoW helpdesk from France. Results: We found that women encounter macro-level, individual-level, and provider-level constraints while trying to access abortion in France. The preferences and needs over secrecy (46.2%), privacy (38.3%), and comfort (34.9%) are among the most frequent reasons for women from France to choose telemedicine abortion through WoW. The COVID-19 pandemic seems to be an important driver for resorting to telemedicine (30.6%). The lockdowns seem to have had an impact on the number of consultations received at WoW from France, increasing from 60 in March to 128 in April during the first lockdown and from 54 in October to 80 in November during the second lockdown. Conclusions: The demand for at-home medical abortion via teleconsultation increased in France during the lockdowns. However, drivers of telemedicine abortion are multi-dimensional and go beyond the conditions unique to the pandemic. Given the various constraints women continue to encounter in accessing safe abortion, telemedicine can help meet womens preferences and needs for secrecy, privacy and comfort, while facilitating improved access to and enabling more person-centred abortion care.","ATAY, H.; Perivier, H.; Gemzell-Danielsson, K.; Guilleminot, J.; Hassoun, D.; Hottois, J.; Gomperts, R.; Levrier, E.",,579,22

While this positions glycans as being essential for understanding and targeting host-pathogen interactions, their considerable diversity and a lack of methods has hitherto stymied progress in leveraging their predictive potential. Here, we utilize a curated dataset of 12,674 glycans from 1,726 species to develop and apply machine learning methods to extract evolutionary information from glycans. Our deep learning-based language model SweetOrigins provides evolution-informed glycan representations that we utilize to discover and investigate motifs used for molecular mimicry-mediated immune evasion by commensals and pathogens. Novel glycan alignment methods enable us to identify and contextualize virulence-determining motifs in the capsular polysaccharide of Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Further, we show that glycan-based phylogenetic trees contain most of the information present in traditional 16S rRNA-based phylogenies and improve on the differentiation of genetically closely related but phenotypically divergent species, such as Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis. Leveraging the evolutionary information inherent in glycans with machine learning methodology is poised to provide further – critically needed – insights into host-pathogen interactions, sequence-to-function relationships, and the major influence of glycans on phenotypic plasticity.","Bojar, Daniel; Powers, Rani K.; Camacho, Diogo M.; Collins, James J.",bioRxiv,579,25

International teams of scholars have pointed out the new work-related challenges, underlining leaders' role in successfully managing them. This study aimed at investigating the role of destructive leadership in the job demands-resources and recovery model during the Covid-19 pandemic. In detail, this study intended to assess (1) whether destructive leadership is positively associated with off-work-hours technology-assisted job demand (off-TAJD) and cognitive demands, as well as whether it decreases autonomy, (2) whether two demands-off-TAJD and cognitive demands-and two resources-social support and autonomy-are respectively negatively and positively related to recovery, and (3) whether recovery mediates the relationship between demands, resources, and exhaustion. A total of 716 French remote workers (61% were women) took part in this study. Data were collected using a self-report questionnaire. A multi-group structural equation model was used to test the hypotheses. The findings confirmed a significant association between destructive leadership, the two job demands, and autonomy;furthermore, all three variables mediated the relationship between destructive leadership and recovery. The findings showed the key role played by recovery as a mediator between, on one hand, off-TAJD, cognitive demands, autonomy, and social support, and, on the other hand, exhaustion.

The CoV nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) is a bi-functional replicase subunit harboring an N-terminal 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain and a C-terminal (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domain that is assumed to be involved in viral mRNA capping. Here, we first revisited the crystal structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV nsp14 to perform an in silico comparative analysis between different betacoronaviruses (β-CoVs). In this study, we identified several residues likely to be involved in the formation of the catalytic pocket of N7MTase, which presents a fold that is distinct from the Rossmann fold observed in most known MTases. Next, for multiple β-CoVs, site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues was used to assess their importance for in vitro enzymatic activity and viral replication in cell culture. For SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, most of the engineered mutations abolished the N7-MTase function, while not affecting nsp14-ExoN activity. Upon reverse engineering of these mutations into β-CoV genomes, we identified two substitutions (R310A and F426A in SARS-CoV) that abrogated viral progeny production and one mutation (H424A) that yielded a crippled phenotype across all β-CoVs tested. Our results identify the N7-MTase as a critical enzyme for β-CoV replication and defined key residues of its catalytic pocket that can be targeted to design inhibitors with a potential pan-coronaviral activity spectrum. Significance Statement The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic emphasizes the urgent need to develop efficient broad-spectrum anti-CoV drugs. The structure-function characterization of conserved CoV replicative enzymes is key to identifying the most suitable drug targets. Using a multidisciplinary comparative approach and different β-CoVs, we characterized the key conserved residues of nsp14 (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase, a poorly defined subunit of the CoV mRNA-synthesizing machinery. Our study highlights the unique structural features of this enzyme and establishes its essential role in β-CoV replication, while identifying two residues that are critical for the replication of all four β-CoVs tested, including SARS-CoV-2.","Ogando, Natacha S.; Kazzi, Priscila El; Posthuma, Clara C.; Thiel, Volker; Canard, Bruno; Ferron, François; Decroly, Etienne; Snijder, Eric J.",bioRxiv,579,12

On the 16th of May around 4.5 million people got infected and over 300,000 died due to the infection of COV2. The effective treatment remains a challenge. Targeted therapeutics are still under investigation. The papain-like protease (PLPro) from the human SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a cysteine protease that plays a critical role in virus replication. Its activity is required to process the viral polyprotein into functional, mature subunits. Moreover, COV2 uses this enzyme to modulate the host’s immune system to its own benefit. Therefore, it represents a highly promising target for the development of antiviral drugs. In this work, we discovered that ebselen, a synthetic organoselenium drug molecule with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and cytoprotective activity in mammalian cells and cytotoxicity in lower organisms, is a highly active inhibitor of PLProCoV2. We proved that ebselen is a covalent, fast-binding inhibitor of PLProCoV2 exhibiting a low micromolar potency. Furthermore, we identified a difference between PLPro from SARS-CoV-1 (the corona virus which caused the 2002–2004 outbreak, SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 that allows to explain the difference in dynamics of the replication, and, thus, the disease progression. Namely, we present that they show differences in the binding affinity of substrates that we observed through kinetics and molecular docking studies. Using a novel Approximate Bayesian Computation method we were able to find kinetic constants for both enzymes. Molecular modeling study on the structure of the active site and binding mode of the ebselen with SARS and COV2 showed also significant differences that could explain our observation that ebselen is less active and slower bounding with SARS than COV2. In conclusion, we show that ebselen inhibits the activity of the essential viral enzyme papain-like protease (PLpro) from SARS-COV-2 in low micromolar range.","Węglarz-Tomczak, Ewelina; Tomczak, Jakub M.; Talma, Michał; Brul, Stanley",bioRxiv,579,1

In this context, leveraging IoT and cloud-based technology help to remedy COVID-19 consequences by means of enabling individuals to manage their essential activities remotely with minimum engagement. However, sharing and gathering sensitive information over public insecure channel brings enormous security risks. To avoid these risks, we present a new practical lightweight multi-factor authentication and authorization scheme for real-time data access in IoT cloud-based environment, called LMAAS-IoT. Our scheme is suitable for, but not limited to, managing large scale systems such as health infrastructures. LMAAS-IoT is secure, efficient and strengthens user anonymity using dynamic index. Our design supports high scalability systems with efficient user registration process in which the legitimate user can access current as well as newly added system entities without further processes. We employed “one-way cryptographic hash functions” along with “bitwise XOR operations”. In addition, a fuzzy extractor algorithm is used at user side to verify user’s biometric information. LMAAS-IoT is analyzed for security with the help of the widely used “Real-Or-Random (ROR)” model;proof of correctness using BAN-logic;formal security verification using the broadly accepted “Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA)” tool as well as the informal security analysis.

Three scenarios were prepared for balancing the deficiency of about 3 GW of power and 20 TWh of electricity in the national power grid in the years 2031–2040, which may emerge as a result of the delayed accomplishment of investment programs, particularly in nuclear energy. The first scenario presents a variant entailing the rapid phasing out of coal and the replacement of the decommissioned power units with new gas-powered units, where the missing power volume would be partially balanced by import, and partially through gas-based production in the new power units. The second scenario assumes that the missing power would be balanced by retaining the existing, older coal-powered units, whereas the required electricity would be compensated by import. The third scenario involves the production of the missing volume of electricity using coal with CO2 capture in existing or new coal-powered units.","Tokarski, Stanisław Magdziarczyk Małgorzata Smoliński Adam",Energies,579,15

The objective of this analysis is to combine text annotation, social network analysis, and statistical modeling to identify advice-seekers on online social media for buprenorphine-naloxone use and study their characteristics. Methods: We collected 5,258 posts and their comments from Reddit between 2014 and 2019. Among 202 posts which met our inclusion criteria, we annotated each post to determine which were advice-seeking (n=137) and not advice-seeking (n=65). We also annotated each posting user's medication use stage and quantified their connectedness using social network analysis. In order to analyze the relationship between advice-seeking with a user's social connectivity and medication use stage, we constructed four models which varied in explanatory variables. Results: The stepwise model (containing ""total degree"" (P=0.002), ""using: inducting/tapering"" (P<0.001), and ""using: other"" (P=0.01) as significant explanatory variables) outperformed all other models. We found that users with fewer connections and who are currently using buprenorphine-naloxone are more likely to seek advice than users who are well-connected and no longer using the medication, respectively. Importantly, advice-seeking behavior is most accurately predicted using a combination of network characteristics and medication use status, rather than either factor alone. Conclusions: Our findings provide insights for the clinical care of people recovering from opioid use disorder and the nature of online medical advice-seeking overall. Clinicians should be especially attentive (e.g., through frequent follow-up) to patients who are inducting or tapering buprenorphine-naloxone or signal limited social support.","Garcia, G.-g.; Dehghanpoor, R.; Stringfellow, E.; Gupta, M.; Rochelle, J.; Mason, E.; Pujol-Mitchell, T.; Jalali, M.

SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illness in 10-15% of infected individuals and mortality in 2-3%. Vaccines are urgently needed to prevent infection and to contain viral spread. Although several mRNA- and adenovirus-based vaccines are highly effective, their dependence on the “cold chain” transportation makes global vaccination a difficult task. In this context, a stable lyophilized vaccine may present certain advantages. Accordingly, establishing additional vaccine platforms remains vital to tackle SARS- CoV-2 and any future variants that may arise. Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been used to eradicate smallpox disease, and several attenuated viral strains with enhanced safety for human applications have been developed. We have generated two candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on two vaccinia viral strains, MVA and v-NY, that express full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Whereas MVA is growth-restricted in mammalian cells, the v-NY strain is replication-competent. We demonstrate that both candidate recombinant vaccines induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in C57BL/6 mice vaccinated according to prime-boost regimens. Furthermore, our vaccination regimens generated TH1-biased immune responses in mice. Most importantly, prime-boost vaccination of a Syrian hamster infection model with MVA-S and v-NY-S protected the hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting that these two vaccines are promising candidates for future development. Finally, our vaccination regimens generated neutralizing antibodies that partially cross-neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.","Kulkarni, Rakesh; Chen, Wen-Ching; Lee, Ying; Kao, Chi-Fei; Hu, Shiu-Lok; Ma, Hsiu-Hua; Jan, Jia-Tsrong; Liao, Chun-Che; Liang, Jian-Jong; Ko, Hui-Ying; Sun, Cheng-Pu; Lin, Yin-Shoiou; Wang, Yu-Chiuan; Wei, Sung-Chan; Lin, Yi-Ling; Ma, Che; Chao, Yu-Chan; Chou, Yu-Chi; Chang, Wen",bioRxiv,579,1

Due to the limited data, existing models suffer from incapable feature extraction and poor network convergence and optimization. Accordingly, a multi-stage residual network, MSRCovXNet, is proposed for effective detection of COVID-19 from chest x-ray (CXR) images. As a shallow yet effective classifier with the ResNet-18 as the feature extractor, MSRCovXNet is optimized by fusing two proposed feature enhancement modules (FEM), i.e. low-level and high-level feature maps (LLFMs and HLFMs), which contain respectively more local information and rich semantic information, respectively. For effective fusion of these two features, a single-stage FEM (MSFEM) and a multi-stage FEM (MSFEM) are proposed to enhance the semantic feature representation of the LLFMs and the local feature representation of the HLFMs, respectively. Without ensembling other deep learning models, our MSRCovXNet has a precision of 98.9% and a recall of 94% in detection of COVID-19, which outperforms several state-of-the-art models. When evaluated on the COVIDGR dataset, an average accuracy of 82.2% is achieved, leading other methods by at least 1.2%.

However, the level of identification with the Catholic Church in Poland has been gradually declining in the last three decades. In this paper, we explore the recent wave of civil protests which began in October 2020 as a reaction to the new restrictions on legal access to abortion. Thousands of people took to the streets to participate in what became known as “the Women’s Strike”. The protesters not only rejected the government but also dissented from the Catholic Church and its strong influence over the Polish state. The case study presented here focuses on the events that took place in Kraków, particularly the protests around the famous “Pope’s window”. We identify the symbolic tools used by the protesters and explore the connection between “Women’s Strike”, the emergent discourses on the poor handling of the sexual abuse problems in the Catholic Church by John Paul II and his close associates, and the growing contestation of Church’s position towards LGBTQ+. We employ the notion of crisis to discuss the implications of the mass protests to the transformation of the Catholic landscape in Poland.","Motak, Dominika Krotofil Joanna Wójciak Dorota",Religions,579,29

The current COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong impact on the labor market from three main perspectives: number of jobs (through unemployment and underemployment), quality of work (through wages, or access to social protection), and through the effects on specific groups, with a higher degree of vulnerability to unfavorable labor market outcomes. The measures aiming to reduce economic activity and social contacts lead to a reduction of labor demand and implicitly to the increase of the unemployment rate. In this context, it becomes even more relevant to be able to monitor the unemployment rate, providing relevant forecasts that include the effects of market shocks. Thus, our paper aims to forecast the unemployment rate for the period 2020–2023 using the Box-Jenkins methodology based on ARIMA models, exploring also the uncertainty based on fan charts. Although the baseline forecast offers valuable information, a good understanding of risks and uncertainties related to this forecast is equally important. The empirical results highlighted an ascending trend for unemployment rate during 2020, followed by a slow and continuous decrease until the end of 2023 with a high probability for the forecast to be above the central projection.","Davidescu, Adriana AnaMaria Apostu Simona-Andreea Stoica Liviu Adrian",Sustainability,579,24

Data on the morphological separation between Anchomanes and Pseudohydrosme are reviewed. Although phylogenomic studies may show in future that the two genera need to be merged, for the moment their separation is reinforced on morphological grounds. Anchomanes lacks the spathe tube, ovoid-globose, 2 – 4 locular pistil and thick, lobed stigma on a symmetric, stout style that we show to characterise the redelimited Pseudohydrosme. (Anchomanes has oblong, polygonal, 1-locular pistils, stigmas asymmetric, sessile, thin and disc-like or on asymmetrical conical styles and are pointed or brush-like). In addition, Pseudohydrosme (where known) has stipitate (versus sessile) fruits and on current evidence lacks the lacticifers recorded from Anchomanes. We test the hypothesis that the taxon is a new species to science, naming it as Pseudohydrosme bogneri, and conclude that it is Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) using the IUCN 2012 standard.

There are many research works have been done in this field, but still have limitations in terms of latency, security, response delay, and long execution times. To remove these limitations, this paper introduces a Smart Healthcare Framework called Remote in-Home Health Monitoring (RHHM), which provides architecture and functionalities in order to facilitate the control of patients’ conditions when they are at home. The framework exploits the benefits of fog layers with high-level services such as local storage, local real-time data processing, and embedded data mining for taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and the cloud and to become a decision maker. In addition to, it incorporates camera with body sensors in diagnosis for more reliability and efficiency with privacy preserving. The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated using the popular iFogSim toolkit. The results show the proposed system’s ability to reduce latency, energy consumption, network communications, and overall response time.

These pathological features are reproduced in a model of chronic meningeal inflammation generated by the injection of lentiviral vectors for the lymphotoxin-α (LTα) and interferon-γ (IFNγ) genes.

Mathematical models are employed to estimate the transmission potential and perform short-term forecasts of the COVID-19 epidemic trajectory in Colombia. Furthermore, geographic heterogeneity of COVID-19 in Colombia is examined along with the analysis of mobility and social media trends, showing that the increase in mobility in July 2020 and January 2021 were correlated with surges in case incidence. The estimation of national and regional reproduction numbers shows sustained disease transmission during the early phase of the pandemic, exhibiting sub-exponential growth dynamics. Moreover, most recent estimates of reproduction number are >1.0 at the national and regional levels as of May 30, 2021.

Although the risk for a severe disease course is low among children with COVID-19, symptoms may be exacerbated by underlying disease and/or immunosuppressive medication. We analysed clinical data from COVID-19 cases in among pediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in Germany reported to the BIKER registry. Objectives: This is an analysis of clinical data for 56 COVID-19 cases reported to the German BIKER registry from 29 German pediatric rheumatology centers and clinics from February 2020 to January 2021. Methods: The major task of the German BIKER (Biologics in Paediatric Rheumatology) Registry is surveillance of biologics used in pediatric rheumatology patients. Following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, a survey was established to proactively interview all participating centers regarding the occurrence, presentation and outcome of SARS-CoV-2-infected children with rheumatic diseases. Initially, the interviews were conducted in weekly intervals, later bi-weekly. A standardized Adverse Event of Special Interest form was developed requesting biographic data, pre-treatment, current medication, data on clinical presentation, course, treatment and outcome of COVID-19 pediatric rheumatology patients. Results: In all, 56 patients with JIA and SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported (Table 1). Of these patients, 71% were 12 or more years old. At the time of infection, 41% of the patients received conventional DMARDs and 52% received biologics (Table 1). Forty-four patients (79%) received either a conventional DMARD or a biologic. Most patients had a polyarticular course of their JIA (57%). In 49 of the 56 cases (88%) COVID-19 was detected directly by PCR (n=46), by antigen test only (n=1) or an undisclosed method (n= 2). Six patients had detectable SARS-CoV2 antibodies and reported to have had typical symptoms. One patient tested negative but developed typical symptoms at approximately the same time a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was returned for a family member. Symptoms were reported in 43 of the 56 patients (77%): fever n=15, rhinitis n=14, cough n=12, headache n=10, loss of sense of taste and/or smell n=9, pharyngitis n=8, fatigue n=5, musculoskeletal pain n=5, GI symptoms n=2 (abdominal pain n=1, diarrhoea n=1), dizziness n=3, encephalitis/seizure/respiratory failure/death n=1. Thirteen patients (23%) were asymptomatic. A 3-year-old female patient initially diagnosed with systemic JIA developed intracranial oedema and respiratory failure. Her SARS-CoV2 PCR test was positive and pulmonary imaging displayed typical changes in lung texture. Before her SARS-CoV-2 infection, the patient was treated with methotrexate and low-dose steroids. Unfortunately, she died three days following hospital admission. Genetic testing revealed an inborn immunodeficiency. Except for this one patient, all other cases were treated as outpatients and no deaths were reported. Conclusion: Apart from one patient with an inborn immunodeficiency who died from her COVID-19 infection, no case of hospitalization or severe COVID-19 was reported in our cohort of JIA patients. At the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, nearly 80% of patients in our cohort had been treated with conventional DMARD and/ or biologics.

Tripal consists of a collection of Drupal modules that are used to manage, visualize, and disseminate biological data stored within Chado. Hosting is provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 cloud instance with resource scaling. New sequences sourced from diagnostic labs contain at a minimum four data items: genomic information; date of collection; collection location (state or province level); and a unique identifier. Users can download annotated genomic sequences from the database using a customized search interface that incorporates data mined from published literature; search for similar sequences using BLAST-based tools; and explore annotated reference genomes. Additionally, because the bulk of data presently are PRRSV sequences, custom curation and annotation pipelines have determined PRRSV genotype (Type 1 or 2), the location of open reading frames and nonstructural proteins, generated amino acid sequences, the occurrence of putative frame shifts, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) classification of GP5 genes. Genomic data from seven major swine pathogens have been curated and annotated. The resource provides researchers timely access to sequences discovered by veterinary diagnosticians, allowing for epidemiological and comparative virology studies. The result will be a better understanding on the emergence of novel swine viruses in the United States (US), and how these novel strains are disseminated in the US and abroad.

Methods: An analysis of a retrospective nature was carried out on clinically-based data as well as CT manifestations in 102 patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis who were admitted to our hospital between the 24th of January, 2020 and the 5th of February, 2020. Scoring of CT manifestations was accomplished, and the total score was used to determine the severity of lung injury. Results: Of the 102 patients, 10 had mild COVID-19, 72 had COVID-19 that was classed as moderate, 16 had COVID-19 that was severe, and 4 had COVID-19 that was critically severe. In all, 92 patients developed lung lesions, among whom 85 showed bilateral lung involvement. Superior lobe lesions and lesions in the middle-inner zone of the lung less frequently affected patients who developed moderate COVID-19 as compared to patients who developed severe/critically severe COVID-19 (all P < 0.05). The lesion manifestations included ground-glass opacity shadows (98.9%) and mixed-density shadows with consolidation (45.7%). Lamellar lesions and interlobular septal thickening less frequently affected patients with COVID-19 that was moderate than in patients with COVID-19 that was severe or critically severe (P < 0.05). In terms of COVID-19 that was moderate, severe or critically severe, the average scores associated with CT were 10.68 ± 6.32, 22.31 ± 8.07, and 30.75 ± 1.89 points respectively. A cumulative CT score of ≤ 20 points was the critical point for distinguishing moderate COVID-19 from severe/critically severe COVID-19. Conclusion: With regards to CT manifestations that were associated with COVID-19, certain characteristics were demonstrated and these varied in relation to different classifications of COVID-19. Cumulative CT score could be used to evaluate the clinical classification and degree of lung damage in patients who develop COVID-19.","Li, Chunhua Tang Guangxiao Liu Xueyan Yang Jia Lu Yanqiu Dai Xin Lyu Fajin Li Yongmei Lyu Shengxiu Chen Yaokai",Journal of Medical Imaging and Health Informatics,579,11

Mainly to identify target sequences in order to generate robust vaccines and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, but also to track viral genetic temporal and geographic evolution and to mine for variants associated with reduced or increased disease severity. Several online tools and bioinformatic phylogenetic analyses have been released, but the main interest lies in the Spike protein, which is the pivotal element of current vaccine design, and in the Receptor Binding Domain, that accounts for most of the neutralizing the antibody activity. Methods Here, we present an open-source bioinformatic protocol, and a web portal focused on SARS-CoV-2 single mutations and minimal consensus sequence building as a companion vaccine design tool. Furthermore, we provide immunogenomic analyses to understand the impact of the most frequent RBD variations. Results Results on the whole GISAID sequence dataset at the time of the writing (October 2020) reveals an emerging mutation, S477N, located on the central part of the Spike protein Receptor Binding Domain, the Receptor Binding Motif. Immunogenomic analyses revealed some variation in mutated epitope MHC compatibility, T-cell recognition, and B-cell epitope probability for most frequent human HLAs.

To identify societal responses to COVID-19 that do address or affect the risk of future zoonoses associated with industrial animal farming, the literature was screened for measures, actions, proposals and attitudes following the guidelines of a scoping review. Forty-one articles with relevant information published between 1 January 2020 and 30 April 2021 were identified directly or indirectly via bibliographies from 138 records retrieved via Google Scholar.

Yet with a serious discrepancy in the resources available between rich and poor countries not every country is able to employ widespread testing. Here we developed machine learning models for predicting the number of COVID-19 cases in a country based on multilinear regression and neural networks models. The models are trained on data from US states and tested against the reported infections in the European countries. The model is based on four features: Number of tests Population Percentage Urban Population and Gini index. The population and number of tests have the strongest correlation with the number of infections. The model was then tested on data from European countries for which the correlation coefficient between the actual and predicted cases R2 was found to be 0.88 in the multi linear regression and 0.91 for the neural network model. The model predicts that the actual number of infections in countries where the number of tests is less than 10% of their populations is at least 26 times greater than the reported numbers.,"Hashim, S.; Farooq, S.; Syriopoulos, E.; Cremer, K. d. l.

This metaphor highlights that stigma is not a static or fixed state but is enacted through processes of continuity and change. The following three orienting concepts are identified: (a) lineage (i.e. origin narratives and initial manifestations are created in relation to existing stigmas, stereotypes, and outgroups), (b) variation (i.e. stigma changes over time in response to new content and contexts), and (c) strength (i.e. stigma can be amplified or weakened through counter- or de-stigmatizing forces). I go on to use this metaphor to offer an analysis of the emergence of COVID-19 stigma. The lineage of COVID-19 stigma includes a long history of contagious disease, resonant with fears of contamination and death. Origin narratives have stigmatized Asian/Chinese groups as virus carriers, leading to socio-political manifestations of discrimination. Newer 'risky' groups have emerged in relation to old age, race and ethnicity, poverty, and weight, whose designation as 'vulnerable' simultaneously identifies them as victims in need of protection but also as a risk to the social body. Counter-stigmatizing trends are also visible. Public disclosure of having COVID-19 by high-status individuals such as the actor Tom Hanks has, in some instances, converted 'testing positive' into shared rather than shamed behaviour in the West. As discourses concerning risk, controllability, and blame unfold, so COVID-19 stigma will further mutate. In conclusion, the metaphor of mutation, and its three concepts of lineage, variation, and strength, offers a vocabulary through which to articulate emergent and ongoing stigma processes. Furthermore, the concept of stigma mutation identifies a clear role for social scientists and public health in terms of process engagement;to disrupt stigma, remaking it in less deadly forms or even to prevent its emergence altogether.","Farrimond, H.",Sociological Research Online,579,1

The formation of toxic disinfection by-products is a negative side-effect of chlorine’s reaction with organic matter, of which trihalomethanes (THM) are one of the most dominant (though not most toxic) groups. Greywater treatment in vertical flow constructed wetlands leads to a decrease in dissolved organic matter. We hypothesized that these dissolved organic carbon (DOC) changes would be reflected in differences in THM formation. Greywater samples, at different treatment levels (i.e., decreasing organic matter content), were exposed to 5 mg/L of chlorine for 1 h. THM formation in raw greywater samples was significantly lower than in the more treated (recirculated) samples, despite their significantly higher DO concentrations. This trend was verified in six different systems. Furthermore, this was also shown when greywater was exposed to higher chlorine doses (25 and 50 mg/L). It is suggested that the increase in THM formation for longer recirculated water is the result of two factors: competition between a higher number of reactive sites in the raw water’s organic matter, which leads to smaller THM yields, and changes in the abundance of THM formation moieties in the recirculated water’s DOC. The latter was reflected in the SUVA increase in the treated water. Overall, THM formation, following treated greywater chlorination at the lower chlorine concentration studied, is not expected to pose an environmental health risk when the water is reused for irrigation.","Bernstein, Anat Hagar Siebner Kaufman Andrew G.",Water,579,10

The pandemic may affect physical and mental health. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the fear of COVID-19 and study the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and preventive behaviors against COVID-19. Material and methods: We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study to evaluate the fear of COVID-19 and preventive behaviors against COVID-19 among the volunteer population in Golestan Province, Iran in May 2020 and June 2020. The online questionnaire included the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and the prevention behaviors against COVID-19, which are used to assess the fear and prevention behaviors of the population, respectively. The data were presented by mean and frequency. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with Fear of COVID-19 at a significant level of 0.05 in Stata 14. Results: A total of 734 of the 900 individuals contacted completed the survey, with a participation rate of 81.5%. The mean age of the participants was 33.97 ± 10.68 years and 375 (51.9%) were females. The mean Fear of COVID-19 score in the participants was 19.69 ± 5.96. There was a significant positive correlation between Fear of COVID-19 and preventive behaviors (r = 0.19, p < 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed participants with a higher perceived threat of COVID-19, women, married participants, health workers and people with underlying diseases had higher levels of fear of COVID-19. Conclusions: The fear of COVID-19 in Iranian society is high, which indicates the need to pay attention to the mental health in pandemic conditions. Appropriate intervention action can be designed and implemented according to the factors that affect fear. In addition, it should be noted that people with less fear are less likely to observe the COVID-19’s preventative behaviors.","Charkazi, A.; Ahmadi-Livani, M.; Nori, A.; Foroughi, A.; Mosazadeh, H.; Rahimi, A.; Ghelichi-Ghojogh, M.; Kalteh, E.

Background IPT augments the control of body balance in contact receivers without a provision of mechanical body weight support. The nature of the processes governing the social haptic interaction, whether they are predominantly reactive or predictive, is uncertain. Method Ten healthy adult individuals performed maximum forward reaching (MFR) without visual feedback while standing upright. We evaluated their control of reaching behaviour and of body balance during IPT provided by either another human individual or by a robotic system in two alternative control modes (reactive vs predictive). Results Changes in reaching behaviour under the robotic IPT, such as lower speed and straighter direction were linked to reduced body sway. MFR of the contact receiver was influenced by the robotic control mode such as that a predictive mode reduced movement variability and increased postural stability to a greater extend in comparison to human IPT. The effects of the reactive robotic system, however, more closely resembled the effects of IPT provided by human contact provider. Conclusion The robotic IPT system was as supportive as human IPT. Robotic IPT seemed to afford more specific adjustments, such as trading reduced speed for increased accuracy, to meet the intrinsic demands and constraints of the robotic system. Possibly, IPT provided by a human contact provider reflected reactive interpersonal postural coordination more similar to the robotic system’s follower mode. Précis Interpersonal touch support by a robotic system was evaluated against support provided a human partner during maximum forward reaching. Human contact receivers showed comparable benefits in their reaching postural performance between the support conditions. Coordination with the robotic system, nevertheless, afforded specific adaptations in the reaching behaviour.","Johannsen, Leif; Potwar, Karna; Saveriano, Matteo; Endo, Satoshi; Lee, Dongheui",bioRxiv,579,5

Thus, due to the increased use of WBL in higher education, an effective WBL interface design for higher education is truly important in order to attract students to use WBL and to further keep them engaged during learning via the Web-based platform. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the aesthetics of web interfaces based on experts’ opinions. This study adopted a quantitative research approach involving a data-gathering survey. Fifteen (15) WBL interfaces were designed based on nine (9) design principles which were balance, proportion, simplicity, alignment, movement, hierarchy, consistency, contrast, and proximity. The results of this study discovered that nine (9) WBL interfaces were determined by the experts as aesthetic interfaces, five (5) WBL interfaces as non-aesthetic and 1 (one) WBL interface was considered neither aesthetic nor non-aesthetic. This finding revealed that six (6) out of nine (9) interfaces had the balance design principle. However, balance was also in most non-aesthetic interfaces. A possible reason that balance was the most design principle in both the aesthetic and the non-aesthetic interfaces is that when designing WBL interfaces, there is a need to consider the combination of the design principles as a whole, and not count the design principles individually. In conclusion, this study's findings could contribute to the knowledge in the Human Computer Interaction domain, specifically in the interface design area. © 2021, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses in the United States have limited the use of banknotes in favor of credit cards. However, SARS-CoV-2 has shown greater stability on plastic in several studies. Herein, the stability of SARS-CoV-2 at room temperature on banknotes, money cards and coins was investigated. In vitro studies with live virus suggested SARS-CoV-2 was highly unstable on banknotes, showing an initial rapid reduction in viable virus and no viral detection by 24 hours. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was far more stable on money cards with live virus detected after 48 hours. Environmental swabbing of currency and money cards on and near the campus of Brigham Young University supported these results, with no detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on banknotes, and a low level on money cards. No viable virus was detected on either. These preliminary results suggest that the use of money cards over banknotes in order to slow the spread of this virus may be ill-advised.

We established two distinct ethanolamine transport systems of a high affinity (K1 = 55.6 - 66.5 μM), mediated by CTL1, and of a low affinity (K2 = 275 - 299 μM), mediated by CTL2. Both types of transport are Na+-independent and mediated in a pH dependent manner, as expected for ethanolamine/H+ antiporters. Primary human fibroblasts with separate frameshift mutations (M1= SLC44A1 ΔAsp517 and M2= SLC44A1 ΔSer126) are devoid of CTL1 ethanolamine transport but maintain unaffected CTL2 transport. The lack of CTL1 or CTL2 reduced the ethanolamine transport, the flux by the CDP-ethanolamine Kennedy pathway and PE synthesis. Overexpression of CTL1 in SLC44A1 ΔSer126 (M2) cells improved the ethanolamine transport and PE synthesis. The SLC44A1 ΔSer126 cells are reliant on CTL2 function and CTL2 siRNA almost completely abolished ethanolamine transport in the whole cells and mitochondria. Overexpression of CTL1 and CTL2 cDNAs increased ethanolamine transport in control and SLC44A1ΔSer126 cells. CTL1 and CTL2 facilitated mitochondrial ethanolamine uptake, but the transport mediated by CTL1 is predominant in the whole cells and mitochondria. These data firmly established that CTL1 and CTL2 are the first identified ethanolamine transporters in the whole cells and mitochondria, with intrinsic roles in de novo PE synthesis by the CDP-Etn Kennedy pathway and compartmentation of intracellular ethanolamine. Significance The lack of Choline Transporter Like 1 (SLC44A1/CTL1) is the primary cause of a new neurodegenerative disorder with elements of childhood-onset parkinsonism and mitochondrial dysfunction. SLC44A2/CTL2 encodes the human neutrophil antigen 3, causes autoimmune hearing loss and Meniere’s disease, and has been recently identified as the main risk factor for thrombosis-the major cause of death in Covid-19 patients. Our investigation provides insights into the novel functions of CTL1 and CTL2 as intrinsic ethanolamine transporters. CTL1 and CTL2 are high and low affinity transporters, with direct roles in the membrane phospholipid synthesis. The work contributes to new knowledge for CTL1 and CTL2 independent transport functions and the optimization of prevention and treatment strategies in those various diseases.","Taylor, Adrian; Grapentine, Sophie; Ichhpuniani, Jasmine; Bakovic, Marica",bioRxiv,579,1

Aerosols can act as cloud condensation nuclei, contributing to the formation of cloud droplets, cloud electrification and lightning, while high concentrations of aerosols can contribute to a decrease in lightning due to radiative effects. Meteorology plays a dominant role in lightning activity, distorting the effect of aerosols. More measurements, as presented here, are needed to establish the complex relationship between aerosols and lightning. The Po Valley, a heavily industrialized region, was highly affected by the COVID-19 lockdown. The reduction of non-essential activities and mobility coincided with a significant drop in pollutant concentrations and lightning. We investigate the relationship between lightning, meteorology and aerosols. We find that the variation in lightning during the lockdown as compared to recent years cannot be fully attributed to meteorology. ~60 ± 10% of the observed decrease is attributed to meteorology, and ~40 ± 10% to the reduction in aerosol emissions. © 2021","Pérez-Invernón, F.

Though clustering of cellular transcriptomes is the default technique for defining cell types and subtypes, single cell clustering can be strongly influenced by technical variation. In fact, the prevalent unsupervised clustering algorithms can cluster cells by technical, rather than biological, variation. Results Compared to de novo (unsupervised) clustering methods, we demonstrate using multiple benchmarks that supervised clustering, which uses reference transcriptomes as a guide, is robust to batch effects. To leverage the advantages of supervised clustering, we present RCA2, a new, scalable, and broadly applicable version of our RCA algorithm. RCA2 provides a user-friendly framework for supervised clustering and downstream analysis of large scRNA-seq data sets. RCA2 can be seamlessly incorporated into existing algorithmic pipelines. It incorporates various new reference panels for human and mouse, supports generation of custom panels and uses efficient graph-based clustering and sparse data structures to ensure scalability. We demonstrate the applicability of RCA2 on SC data from human bone marrow, healthy PBMCs and PBMCs from COVID-19 patients. Importantly, RCA2 facilitates cell-type-specific QC, which we show is essential for accurate clustering of SC data from heterogeneous tissues. In the era of cohort-scale SC analysis, supervised clustering methods such as RCA2 will facilitate unified analysis of diverse SC datasets.

International fellows in subspecialty training programs are essential members of the frontline physician workforce, who may be facing additional and unique challenges being far away from their home country. We aimed to understand the impact of the pandemic on the wellbeing of current international fellows in the Hematology/Oncology training program. Methods: We conducted an online survey of 52 international fellows at the PMCC from July 6-August 10, 2020. There were 60 questions divided into 4 sections: demographics, wellbeing assessment using the validated Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS), fellowship specific questions (personal and professional) and coping strategies using the validated brief COPE scale. Results: Response rate was 46% (n = 24). Relevant demographics include: married (65%), male (54%), age between 31-35 years (48%), have children (48%), and home country from Asia (48%). Mean SWEMWBS score was 21, indicating lower overall wellbeing than the general population (23.6). Compared to pre-COVID-19, many reported a decline in their wellbeing (63%), sense of guilt for not being with their family (45%) or helping their country (41%), stress in personal relationships (26%), fatigue (50%), sleep disorders (38%) and loss of interest in daily activities (38%). Personal events were altered by almost 80% and 20% plans to extend their fellowship. According to the Brief- COPE scale, most fellows used more adaptive coping mechanisms (mean score 39.2) as opposed to maladaptive ones (mean score 21.8). Conclusions: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the overall wellbeing of international fellows. Understanding the specific challenges and coping mechanisms of international fellows may help Institutions develop better targeted strategies to promote their overall wellbeing, professional development and highquality patient care during these unprecedented times.","Stecca, C.; Jiang, D.

To minimize transmission, we find that the highest priority individuals across 179 countries are typically those between 30 and 59 years of age because of their high contact rates and higher risk of infection and disease. Conversely, morbidity and mortality are initially most effectively reduced by targeting 60+ year olds who are more likely to experience severe disease. However, when population-level coverage is sufficient -- such that herd immunity can be achieved through targeted dose allocation -- prioritizing middle-aged individuals becomes the most effective strategy to minimize hospitalizations and deaths.

The primary outcome measure was willingness to use immunity certificates across three different domestic settings (1. Visiting the GP for a non urgent health issue, 2. Dining in a restaurant, and 2. Attending a performance in a theatre). For each setting two options, one prioritising convenience (option A) and the other privacy (option B), were offered. Our secondary outcome measures were computed indices from items adapted from the Health Belief Model, Attitudes towards sharing immunity status with service providers, Prior to COVID- 19 lifestyle. In addition, we recorded data about respondents socio- demographic characteristics. Respondents were more willing to use immunity certificates that prioritised convenience, rather than privacy, when visiting their GP (92%). However, privacy was more favourable (84%) in the other two settings (dining in a restaurant and going to a theatre) compared to convenience (39%). Personal beliefs about COVID-19 and immunity certificates were associated with variations in willingness to use these across all scenarios. No variations were observed across socio-demographics and lifestyle. The findings of this survey suggest that there is not one size fits all solution for designing immunity certificates. Immunity certificates are complex socio-technical systems, any attempt to implement these for domestic use should be tailored to different settings and user needs. The design of certification services requires a more evidence-based approach and further research is needed to understand how different settings, design elements (like convenience or privacy) and personal beliefs about the pandemic should inform their design.","Niculaescu, C.-E.; Sassoon, I.; Avila, I.

To cross the outer membrane of the complex Gram-negative cell envelope, antibiotics permeate through porins, trimeric channel proteins that enable the exchange of small polar molecules.

Using X-ray crystallography, high-resolution electrophysiology, atomistic biomolecular simulation, and liposome swelling experiments, we demonstrate differences in drug binding affinity, ion selectivity and drug permeability of PorB. Our work further reveals distinct interactions between the transversal electric field in the porin eyelet and the zwitterionic drugs, which manifest themselves under applied electric fields in electrophysiology and are altered by the mutation.

Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized, double-blind, single-dose, phase 3 trial that enrolled residents and staff of 74 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in the United States with at least 1 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 index case. A total of 1175 participants enrolled in the study from August 2 to November 20, 2020. Database lock was triggered on January 13, 2021, when all participants reached study day 57. Interventions Participants were randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion of bamlanivimab, 4200 mg (n = 588), or placebo (n = 587). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was incidence of COVID-19, defined as the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and mild or worse disease severity within 21 days of detection, within 8 weeks of randomization. Key secondary outcomes included incidence of moderate or worse COVID-19 severity and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results The prevention population comprised a total of 966 participants (666 staff and 300 residents) who were negative at baseline for SARS-CoV-2 infection and serology (mean age, 53.0 [range, 18-104] years;722 [74.7%] women). Bamlanivimab significantly reduced the incidence of COVID-19 in the prevention population compared with placebo (8.5% vs 15.2%;odds ratio, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.28-0.68];P &lt; .001;absolute risk difference, -6.6 [95% CI, -10.7 to -2.6] percentage points). Five deaths attributed to COVID-19 were reported by day 57;all occurred in the placebo group. Among 1175 participants who received study product (safety population), the rate of participants with adverse events was 20.1% in the bamlanivimab group and 18.9% in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were urinary tract infection (reported by 12 participants [2%] who received bamlanivimab and 14 [2.4%] who received placebo) and hypertension (reported by 7 participants [1.2%] who received bamlanivimab and 10 [1.7%] who received placebo). Conclusions and Relevance Among residents and staff in skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, treatment during August-November 2020 with bamlanivimab monotherapy reduced the incidence of COVID-19 infection. Further research is needed to assess preventive efficacy with current patterns of viral strains with combination monoclonal antibody therapy. This randomized clinical trial assesses the effect of a single intravenous infusion of bamlanivimab vs placebo on incidence of COVID-19 among residents and staff of skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. Question Among residents and staff of skilled nursing and assisted living facilities with high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, what is the effect of bamlanivimab on the incidence of COVID-19? Findings This randomized phase 3 clinical trial included 966 participants who were residents and staff at US skilled nursing and assisted living facilities with at least 1 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 index case and who were negative at baseline for SARS-CoV-2 infection and serology, enrolled from August to November 2020. The incidence of COVID-19 infection among those treated with bamlanivimab vs placebo was 8.5% vs 15.2%, respectively, a difference that was statistically significant. Meaning Bamlanivimab monotherapy compared with placebo reduced the risk of COVID-19 in residents and staff of skilled nursing and assisted living facilities.","Cohen, M. S.; Nirula, A.; Mulligan, M.

A popular example is ATAC-seq, whereby Tn5 transposase inserts sequencing adapters into accessible DNA (‘tagmentation’). CUT&Tag is a tagmentation-based epigenomic profiling method in which antibody tethering of Tn5 to a chromatin epitope of interest profiles specific chromatin features in small samples and single cells. Here we show that by simply modifying the tagmentation conditions for histone H3K4me2 or H3K4me3 CUT&Tag, antibody-tethered tagmentation of accessible DNA sites is redirected to produce chromatin accessibility maps that are indistinguishable from the best ATAC-seq maps. Thus, chromatin accessibility maps can be produced in parallel with CUT&Tag maps of other epitopes with all steps from nuclei to amplified sequencing-ready libraries performed in single PCR tubes in the laboratory or on a home workbench. As H3K4 methylation is produced by transcription at promoters and enhancers, our method identifies transcription-coupled accessible regulatory sites.","Henikoff, Steven; Henikoff, Jorja G.; Kaya-Okur, Hatice S.; Ahmad, Kami",bioRxiv,579,20

Deficits in predictive coding may contribute to difficulties with social communication and overreliance on repetitive predictable environments in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using a mismatch negativity (MMN) task involving rhythmic tone sequences of varying complexity, we tested the hypotheses that 1) individuals with ASD have reduced MMN response to auditory stimuli that deviate in presentation timing from expected patterns, particularly as pattern complexity increases and 2) amplitude of MMN signal is inversely correlated with level of impairment in social communication and repetitive behaviors. Electroencephalography was acquired as individuals (age 6-21years) listened to repeated five-rhythm tones that varied in the Shannon entropy of the rhythm across three conditions (zero, medium-1 bit) and high-2 bit entropy). The majority of the tones conformed to the established rhythm (standard tones); occasionally the 4th tone was temporally shifted relative to its expected time of occurrence (deviant tones). Social communication and repetitive behaviors were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale and Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised. Both neurotypical controls (n=19) and individuals with ASD (n=21) show stepwise decreases in MMN as a function of increasing entropy. Contrary to the result forecasted by a predictive coding hypothesis, individuals with ASD do not differ from controls in these neural mechanisms of prediction error to auditory rhythms of varied temporal complexity, and there is no relationship between these signals and social communication or repetitive behavior measures. Lay Summary We tested the idea that the brain’s ability to use previous experience to influence processing of sounds is weaker in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than in neurotypical individuals. We found no difference between individuals with ASD and neurotypical controls in brain wave responses to sounds that occurred earlier than expected in either simple or complex rhythms. There was also no relationship between these brain waves and social communication or repetitive behavior scores.","Knight, Emily J.; Oakes, Leona A.; Hyman, Susan L.; Freedman, Edward G.; Foxe, John J.",bioRxiv,579,1

In this paper we focus to analyze the accidents data from the data reported by Instat web site over this year and to estimate whether this pandemic has affected to the number of road accidents and fatalities in our country. As in many other countries there is a noticeable decrease in road accidents during this year, but at the same time it seems that the number of fatalities in proportion to the reduction of accidents has not fallen. We argue that it is possible to apply Chi-Square approach and also Odss Radio approach to better identify the significant factors which affect road accidents. Furthermore through these statistical approaches we have studied the significant relation between the factors and the fatalities that occurred during 2020. It is evidenced that gender, age and months are significant factors in our accidents data;there is also a predominance of men gender in fatalities compared to women gender as well as drivers more than pedestrians. Given the rapidly increasing of lost lives in proportion to road accidents that are a major challenge for the health system, we recommend that more emphasis placed on the use of statistical methods - in the search for road safety by government researchers and road safety experts.","Dervishi, R.; Kasharaj, J.; Kondi, I.",International Journal of Ecosystems and Ecology Science-Ijees,579,16

In this work we describe the innate cell signature and immunophenotype of children admitted to PICU because of PIMS-TS. Also, we compare it with healthy controls and children admitted to PICU because bacterial infection, viral infection and Kawasaki disease. We made a prospective-retrospective observational study in a tertiary pediatric hospital. Children admitted to PICU because of PIMS-TS from March 2020 to September 2020 were consecutively included. They were compare with previous cohorts from our center. A total of 247 children were included: 183 healthy controls, 25 viral infections, 20 bacterial infections, 6 Kawasaki disease and 13 PIMS-TS. PIMT-TS showed the lowest percentage of lymphocytes and monocytes with higher relative numbers of CD4+ (p =0,000). At the same time, we describe a differential expression of CD64, CD11a and CD11b. Monocytes and neutrophils in PIMS-TS showed higher levels of CD64 expression compared to all groups (p = 0,000). Also, proteins involved in leukocyte tissue migration, like CD11a and CD11b were highly expressed compare to other severe viral or bacterial infections (p = 0,000). In PIMS-TS this increased CD11a expression could be a sign of the activation and trafficking of these leukocytes. These findings are congruent with an inflammatory process and the trend of these cells to leave the bloodstream. In conclusion, we compare for the first time the innate cellular response of children with PIMS-TS with other severe forms of viral or bacterial infection and Kawasaki disease. Our findings define a differential cell innate signature.

The admission of large numbers of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease risks overwhelming the capacity to protect other patients from exposure. The delay between clinical suspicion and confirmatory testing adds to the complexity of the problem. Methods We implemented a triage tool aimed at minimising hospital acquired COVID-19 particularly to patients at risk of severe disease. Patients were allocated to triage categories defined by likelihood of COVID-19 and risk of a poor outcome. Category A (low-likelihood; high-risk), B (high-likelihood; high-risk), C (high-likelihood; low-risk) and D (low-likelihood; low-risk). This determined the order of priority for isolation in single-occupancy rooms with Category A the highest. Patients in other groups were cohorted when isolation capacity was limited with additional interventions to reduce transmission. Results 93 patients were evaluated with 79 (85%) receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis during their admission. Of those without a COVID-19 diagnosis: 10 were initially triaged to Category A; 0 to B; 1 to C and 4 to D. All high risk patients requiring isolation were, therefore, admitted to single-occupancy rooms and protected from exposure. 28 (30%) suspected COVID-19 patients were evaluated to be low risk (groups C & D) and eligible for cohorting. No symptomatic hospital acquired infections were detected in the cohorted patients. Discussion Application of a clinical triage tool to guide isolation and cohorting decisions may reduce the risk of hospital acquired transmission of COVID-19 especially to individuals at the greatest of risk of severe disease.","Patterson, Benjamin; Marks, Michael; Martinez-Garcia, Gemma; Bidwell, Gabriella; Luintel, Akish; Ludwig, Dalia; Parks, Tom; Gothard, Philip; Thomas, Rik; Logan, Sarah; Shaw, Karen; Stone, Neil; Brown, Mike",,579,1

In this paper, we will review on the use of the natural products and its findings on how it is being used for treating and preventing the infection of COVID-19. Only those reports were included that WHO edited in the situation. The extracts of the various herbal products and the molecules that are purified exert an anti-SARS-CoV-2 action and they inhibit the virus directly since the entry of the virus by replicating them. It is even interesting to find that some of the herb related products are able to block the C-2 receptors that are protease serine TMPRRS2. These are the proteins COVID-19 virus requires to infect the human cells.

However, increased global demand has led to a shortage of commercial SARS-CoV-2 sequencing kits, and not every country has the technological capability or the funds for high-throughput sequencing platforms. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate a rapid, cost-efficient genome sequencing protocol that uses supplies, equipment, and methodologic expertise available in standard molecular or diagnostic laboratories to identify circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Methods: Sets of primers flanking the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene were designed using SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences retrieved from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) Database and synthesized in-house. Primer specificity and final sequences were verified using online prediction analyses with BLAST. The primers were validated using 282 nasopharyngeal samples collected from patients assessed as positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the diagnostic laboratory of the hospital using a Rotor-Gene PCR cycler with an Altona Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 kit. The patient samples were subjected to RNA extraction followed by cDNA synthesis, conventional polymerase chain reaction, and Sanger sequencing. Protocol specificity was confirmed by comparing these results with SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing of the same samples. Results: Sanger sequencing using the newly designed primers and next-generation whole genome sequencing of 282 patient samples indicated identical variants of concern results: 123 samples contained the alpha variant (B.1.1.7); 78, beta (B.1.351), 0, gamma (P.1), and 13, delta (B.1.617.2). Moreover, the remaining samples were non-VOC that belonged to none of these variants and had 99.97% identity with the reference genome. Only four samples had poor sequence quality by Sanger sequencing owing to a low viral count (Ct value >38). Therefore, mutation calls were >98% accurate. Conclusions: Sanger sequencing method using in-house primers is an alternative approach that can be used in facilities with existing equipment to mitigate limitations in high throughput supplies required to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. This protocol is easily adaptable for detection of emerging variants.","Alhamlan, F.; Bakheet, D.; Bohol, M.; Alsanea, M.; Alahaideb, B.; Alhadeq, F.; Alsuwairi, F.; Al-Abdulkareem, M.; Asiri, M.; Almaghrabi, R.; Altamimi, S.; Mutabagani, M.; Althawadi, S.; Al-Qahtani, A.",,579,26

While there are limited reports of neurologic involvement in the context of COVID-19 infection, recent evidence has established the neuroinvasive potential of the virus. A 57-year-old man was diagnosed with COVID-19 via a polymerase chain reaction test and treated as an outpatient with a combination of prednisone and azithromycin. Nine days after his initial diagnosis, he was admitted to the intensive care unit for acute respiratory failure where he required high-flow oxygen support at a maximum of 60 L/minute. Ten days after his admission to the intensive care unit, he was discharged requiring no oxygen at rest, but 2-3 L/minute with exertion. Nine days after his discharge, he was readmitted with a six-day history of bilateral lower extremity weakness, low back pain, diminished sensation, bowel and bladder incontinence, and decreased rectal sensation and tone. Evaluation for cauda equina syndrome was unremarkable;however, cervical magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe central cervical stenosis of C3-4 and C4-5 with spinal cord flattening and intraparenchymal T2 hyperintensity. The examination was notable for muted reflexes in the bilateral lower extremities, T10 sensory level, decreased rectal tone, and ambulation with a walker. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed an albuminocytologic dissociation. Treatment with intravenous dexamethasone and immunoglobulin resulted in partial motor resolution and complete resolution of his bowel and bladder incontinence within three days of treatment. In the face of this novel global pandemic, surgeons and clinicians should carefully evaluate patients presenting with neurologic deficits and ensure a thorough examination to accurately identify the appropriate etiology for a neurologic deficit.","Letchuman, V.; Wemhoff, K.

Our research (Natsal-COVID) indicates that in the UK, 10% of people aged 18–59 had physical or sexual contact with a romantic or sexual partner outside their household (PCOH) during a period in which contact was limited. We explored motivations and decision-making among people reporting PCOH in the four months following the initial national lockdown on 23rd March 2020.MethodSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 individuals reporting PCOH during a period in which physical distancing measures were in place. Participants were recruited through a large, quasi-representative survey investigating sexual behaviour in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic (Natsal-COVID). Interviews were analysed thematically.ResultsParticipants were single (n=8) or in long-term, non-cohabiting, relationships (n=10). While participants in the two groups differed in their reported motivations for PCOH, all demonstrated complex and individualised decision-making, weighing up risks such as SARS-CoV-2 transmission, judgement of peers, and benefits, including feelings of security and improved mental health. For those in relationships, the primary motivation was continuity: participants expected to continue seeing their romantic partner. Participants rationalised this contact as ‘low risk’ in relation to other ‘risks’ of COVID-19 exposure, and reduced other activities (such as shopping, seeing friends) to maintain this contact. For single participants, loneliness and boredom were reported as the primary motivators for PCOH, with dating apps often used to facilitate contact. For both groups, evidence of considered decision-making was clear, with participants referencing government guidance, personal situations, and risk when describing their deliberations.ConclusionIndividuals did not make decisions about PCOH lightly. However, physical contact with partners was considered important and thus rationalised.

This systematic review aims to assess the association of mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW) and platelet-large cell ratio (P-LCR) with disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Methods: English and Chinese databases were searched electronically to identify studies reporting data on MPV, PDW or P-LCR in COVID-19 patients. Included articles underwent a quality rating. A meta-analysis was performed using the standard mean difference and interpreted as the common language effect size (CLES). Results: Twenty-two studies (11,906 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Of these, 14 were rated poor and eight were fair. The MPV and P-LCR was significantly higher at hospital admission in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. The MPV, PDW and P-LCR were significantly higher at hospital admission in non-survivors compared to survivors. There was a marked increase in the probability of a severe COVID-19 patient presenting with higher P-LCR at hospital admission than a non-severe patient (CLES: 68.7% [95% CI: 59.8%, 76.5%]), when compared with MPV and PDW ((CLES: 59.2% [95% CI: 53.1%, 65.1%]) and (CLES: 55.9% [95% CI: 50.6%, 62.2%]), respectively). Conclusion: Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with the increased production of larger, younger platelets. When comparing MPV, PDW and P-LCR, P-LCR is the most important biomarker for evaluating platelet activity. P-LCR testing at hospital admission could identify COVID-19 patients with increased risk for thrombotic events, allowing preventative treatment.","Daniels, S. A.; Wei, H.; Denning, D. W.",,579,28

We have reported that mice treated with a combination of inhaled Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/6 and TLR 9 agonists (Pam2-ODN) to stimulate innate immunity are broadly protected against respiratory pathogens, but the mechanisms underlying this protection remain incompletely elucidated. Here, we show in a lethal paramyxovirus model that Pam2-ODN-enhanced survival is associated with robust virus inactivation by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which occurs prior to internalization by lung epithelial cells. However, we also found that mortality in sham-treated mice temporally corresponded with CD8+ T cell-enriched lung inflammation that peaks on days 11-12 after viral challenge, when the viral burden has waned to a scarcely detectable level. Pam2-ODN treatment blocked this injurious inflammation by reducing the viral burden, and alternatively, depleting CD8+ T cells 8 days after viral challenge also decreased mortality. These findings reveal opportunities for targeted immunomodulation to protect susceptible individuals against the morbidity and mortality of respiratory viral infections.","Wali, Shradha; Flores, Jose R.; Jaramillo, Ana Maria; Goldblatt, David L.; Pantaleón García, Jezreel; Tuvim, Michael J.; Dickey, Burton F.; Evans, Scott E.",bioRxiv,579,28

Using an experiment-to-machine-learning scheme applied to a limited experimental dataset, we built a model that can predict the photocatalytic activity of materials for antimicrobial applications over a wide range of material compositions. This machine-learning-assisted strategy offers the opportunity to reduce the cost, labor, time, and precursors consumed during experiments that are based on trial and error.

Objectives: To investigate the cumulative incidence and risk factors for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection and SARS-CoV2 testing in patients with IMID compared with matched non-IMID patients from the general population. Methods: A population-based, matched cohort study was conducted using health administrative data from adults living in Ontario, Canada from January to December 2020. Cohorts for each of the following IMID were assembled: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (including lupus, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's, inflammatory myositis), multiple sclerosis (MS), iritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and vasculitis. Each patient was matched with 5 non-IMID comparators based on age, sex, area of residence and living in long term care (LTC). Standardized cumulative rates of testing for SARS-CoV2, and for receiving a positive test between IMID and non-IMID were compared between IMID and non-IMID patients. Multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed sociodemographic factors associated with COVID-19 testing and positivity. Results: A total of 493,499 IMID patients and 2,466,946 non-IMID comparators were assessed. Significantly more IMID patients versus non-IMID were tested for SARS-CoV2 (27.4% vs. 22.7%), while the proportions of those positive for COVID-19 were identical (0.9% of all patients in both groups). Overall, IMID patients were more likely to undergo SARS-CoV2 testing (odds ratio (OR) 1.28, 95% CI 1.27, 1.29), but their overall risk of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was not elevated (OR 0.97 (95% CI 0.93, 1)). However, the risk of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection was lower in IBD (OR 0.75), MS (OR 0.77) and psoriasis (OR 0.94) and marginally higher in RA (OR 1.07) and iritis (OR 1.13) compared with non-IMID comparators (Figure 1A). The highest standardized rates of COVID-19 infection were found in vasculitis (115 per 10,000 patients) and iritis (109 per 10,000 patients) (Figure 1B). Risk factors for COVID-19 infection included younger age, living in LTC, multimorbidity, urban living and lower income (Table 1). Conclusion: Patients across all IMID were more likely to be tested for COVID-19 versus non-IMID patients. IMID patients were not at higher risk for testing positive for COVID-19 as an overall group, yet risk varied across disease subgroups.","Eder, L.; Croxford, R.; Drucker, A.; Mendel, A.; Bindee, K.; Touma, Z.; Johnson, S.; Cook, R.; Bernatsky, S.; Haroon, N.; Widdifield, J.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,579,24

The purpose of this integrative review was to update what is currently known about blended learning within the Aotearoa New Zealand and Australian nursing education context and to generate new perspectives to inform the evidence-based use of blended learning. An integrative review approach was utilised. Systematic searches of the databases Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Complete, ERIC via Ovid, PsychInfo via Ovid, and Google Scholar were conducted. Articles were included for review if they were published between 2010 and 2020 and reported on research involving a combination of online and face-toface teaching in undergraduate nursing programmes in Aotearoa New Zealand or Australia that led to a registered nurse qualification. All seven articles that met the inclusion criteria were from Australia and were published between 2016 and 2020. The findings were analysed and summarised into five main categories: definitions of blended learning;teacher qualities;benefits of blended learning;challenges of the blended learning approach;and future considerations. While this review found that teacher qualities influenced students' perceptions and experiences of blended learning, further research is needed on how teachers perceived and experienced blended learning. While COVID-19 has accelerated the use of online and blended learning internationally;this review identified a lack of empirical knowledge on the efficacy and experience of blended learning across nursing education in Aotearoa New Zealand an Australia. A more nuanced definition of blended learning would assist researchers and educators to develop effective and adaptable blended learning teaching strategies in the Aotearoa New Zealand and Australian context. With increased directives for adaptable blended learning modalities within nursing education, this review of the current literature within Aotearoa New Zealand and Australia was timely and will provide important updates for nurse educators on how best to provide blended learning and provide a framework for future research.","Neville, Stephen PhD R.

Three different options were available for the school to choose from. However, most schools have opted for option A which states that the classes are organized face-to-face but various safety measures must be ensured. Each class or group is equated to a closed set where there are no distance requirements. In turn, the distance between the classes must be observed. This means that students stay in the same class all day and are accompanied by teachers of the respective classes. This can lead to improper ventilation as for most of the schools in Latvia it is organized through the opening of windows. To test this, measurements of CO2 concentration were done in a classroom Secondary School in Daugavpils. The results showed that the CO2 concentration was very high and often reached and exceeded the maximum measuring capacity of the device - 4000 ppm. It indicates that following the special safety procedures cause a negative effect on IAQ as the classrooms are not properly ventilated. This can lead to a drop in the performance of pupils as well as stimulate the transmission of other infectious diseases.

The Cec was founded in 2002 to provide clinical ethics support services. While its approach was inspired by North American models, it was shaped by and adapted to the French context. This approach is called the ""Commitment Model,"" as it draws upon societal engagement in all phases of its service and places the perspectives of individual patients at its core.

The need to restore the assistance activity has led us to adopt new individual prophylaxis and hygiene measures. METHODS Doctors and staff must wear dedicated clothes. Mask and gloves are mandatory for patients. A visit is scheduled every 60 minutes to allow the sanitation of the rooms. The day before the visit patients are contacted by telephone for the Covid-19 risk triage. In the presence of symptoms the visit is postponed. In the presence of other risk factors a IgG/IgM Rapid Test for Covid-19 is performed on admission to the clinic. In the presence of fever, if an extraordinary rapid test cannot be performed, the visit must be postponed. Rapid test positive patients cannot be visited: they are placed in solitary confinement at their home waiting for a nasopharyngeal swab for Covid-19. When the rapid test is positive, immediate room sanitation also occurs. The rooms dedicated to the outpatient clinic as well as medical and not medical instruments are disinfected. CONCLUSION The one adopted can be a useful management model for any type of care activity in order to guarantee the safety of patients and all the staff.

The positive samples further underwent genetic sequencing. RESULTS Among the 1165 nasopharyngeal aspirates, viruses were detected in 871 samples (74.76%), among which RSV (27.03%) was the most common virus, followed by HRV (17.33%), PIV3 (13.73%), HBoV (8.67%) and hMPV (6.52%). The overall positive rate of viral detection showed no significant differences between males and females (X2=2.241, P=0.134), whereas the positive rates of PIV3, hMPV, and HBoV in males were higher than in females. The positive rate of viral detection showed significant differences among different age groups (X2=10.934, P=0.027), and the highest positive rate was noted in the age group of 6 months to 1 year. Furthermore, the overall positive rate of viral detection showed a significant difference in term of seasonal distribution, with a peak prevalence in winter. CONCLUSIONS Virues predominate in the etiology of pediatric ALRTI in Changsha, and RSV, HRV and PIV3 are the main viruses for ALRTI. HBoV and hMPV have become increasingly important. Viral infection-associated ALRTI shows a prevail in the age group of 6 months to 1 year as well as in winter.","Xiao, Ni-Guang; Zhang, Bing; Duan, Zhao-Jun; Xie, Zhi-Ping; Zhou, Qiong-Hua; Zhong, Li-Li; Gao, Han-Chun; Ding, Xiao-Fang; Zeng, Sai-Zhen; Huang, Han; Hou, Yun-De",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,579,17

Two conserved viral glycoproteins, gB and gH, are required for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)-mediated membrane fusion, but little is known of how these proteins cooperate during entry. Both glycoproteins were shown to contain heptad repeat (HR) sequences predicted to form alpha-helical coiled coils, and the inhibitory activity against infection of four sets of synthetic peptides corresponding to HR1 and HR2 of gB and gH was tested. The interactions between these HR peptides were also investigated by circular dichroism, native polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography. gH coiled-coil peptides were more effective than gB coiled-coils peptides in inhibiting virus infectivity. The peptides did not impair fusion when added to cells immediately after infection. In contrast, inhibition of infection was observed, albeit to various extents, when peptides were added to virus before or during inoculation. The results of biophysical analyses were indicative of the existence of an interaction between HR1 and HR2 of gH and suggest that the HRs of gB and gH do not interact with each other.","Galdiero, Stefania; Vitiello, Mariateresa; D'Isanto, Marina; Falanga, Annarita; Collins, Craig; Raieta, Katia; Pedone, Carlo; Browne, Helena; Galdiero, Massimiliano",The Journal of general virology,579,28

Fire training and march training may present environmental risk factors for adenovirus-associated outbreaks. Most symptoms were mild. The most frequent symptom in patients with pneumonia and FRI was cough. Patients with pneumonia were associated with an increased incidence of dizziness (crude odds ratio [cOR], 9.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.38-37.15) and a decreased incidence of rhinorrhea (cOR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.04-0.53) during adenovirus-associated outbreaks.

However, due to the relatively high costs involved, it has yet to attain widespread use by chytridiomycosis researchers. Using the results of a disease survey of 467 wild frogs from eastern Queensland, Australia, we examine the necessity of triplicate assays in qPCR detection of chytridiomycosis. We describe a singlicate qPCR assay that can be used to substantially decrease costs, with no significant decrease in sensitivity.

Performing radical surgery using this technique requires preoperative estimation of tumor extension both histologically and by X-ray images. It should allow provide safe and radical excision of rectal tumors. In our department, patients with rectal tumors are evaluated for risk factors using barium enema, endoscopic ultrasound, punch biopsy, etc. Fifty patients (rectal cancer, 34: cartinoid, 4: adenoma, 12) have undergone radical TEM. The operation was converted to open surgery in 2 cases because of rectal perforation. Radical open surgery was performed after TEM in 1 patient since cancer invasion was revealed by postoperatively upon histological examination.

For people more directly involved in clinical practice (physicians, clinical laboratory professionals and patients), translational research responds to the need to accelerate the capture of benefits of research, closing the gap between what we know and what we practice. This basically means the transfer of diagnostic and therapeutic advances proven effective in large, well-conducted trials (and, therefore, evidence-based) to daily medical practice. Translational research should be regarded as a two-way road: bench to bedside, and bedside to bench. In particular, to make possible a more effective translation process, a new road map should be implemented through interaction and cooperation between basic researchers, clinicians, laboratory professionals and manufacturers. Some examples of recent developments in clinical laboratory testing, including markers of cardiovascular diseases, clinical proteomics and recombinant allergens, may explain the importance of careful evaluation of all variables that allow the introduction of such new insights into clinical practice to assure better clinical outcomes. The vital role of laboratory medicine in the delivery of safer and more effective healthcare requires more careful evaluation not only of the analytical characteristics, but also of any other variable that may affect the clinical usefulness and diagnostic performances of laboratory tests, thus allowing more accurate interpretation and utilization of laboratory information.","Plebani, Mario; Marincola, Francesco M",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,579,11

We now present data on the structural proteins of EAV and the assignment of their respective genes. Virions are composed of a 14-kDa nucleocapsid protein (N) and three membrane proteins designated M, GS, and GL. M is an unglycosylated protein of 16 kDa, and GS and GL are N-glycosylated proteins of 25 and 30 to 42 kDa, respectively. The broad size distribution of GL results from heterogeneous N-acetyllactosamine addition since it is susceptible to digestion by endo-beta-galactosidase. Using monospecific antisera as well as an antivirion serum, and by expression of individual ORFs, the genes for the structural proteins were identified: ORF 7 codes for N, ORF 6 for M, ORF 5 for GL, and ORF 2 for GS. With the exception of GS, the proteins are about equally abundant in EAV virions, being present at a molar ratio of 3 (N):2 (M):3 (GL). The GS protein, which is expressed at a level similar to that of M in infected cells, is strikingly underrepresented in virus particles (1 to 2%). Our data justify a distinct taxonomic position for EAV, together with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus and simian hemorrhagic fever virus; although coronavirus- and toroviruslike in features of transcription and translation, the virion architecture of EAV is fundamentally different.","de Vries, A A; Chirnside, E D; Horzinek, M C; Rottier, P J",Journal of virology,579,17

Methodology Data from 25 confirmed moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients, with high levels of pro-inflammatory markers and pulmonary function worsening on best supportive care and Itolizumab were included in this analysis. Patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were excluded. Clinical parameters (oxygen requirement) and laboratory parameters (ferritin, interleukin [IL]-6, C-reactive protein [CRP] and absolute lymphocyte count [ALC]) were studied preand post-treatment. Average total length of stay in hospital and ICU, percentage of patients requiring ICU admission and average time taken for weaning off oxygen for all patients were also reported. Results All Patients were in the range of 30-78 years of age, with majority being male (76%). Most prevalent comorbid conditions were diabetes (64%) and hypertension (28%). Median IL-6 value showed a decline by 85.4%. Significant reduction in median CRP (86.96%) and Ferritin (55.61%) was observed post- Itolizumab compared to pre-dose values. Median ALC improved from 1605 cells/ mm3 (pre-dose) to 2462.5 cells/mm3 (post-dose). Average recovery time, defined as time from Itolizumab infusion to discharge was 9.28 ± 4.04 days. Average duration of hospitalization and ICU admission was 14.24 ± 4.15 and 8.27 ± 4.47 days, respectively, with 76% patients recovered and discharged. Median oxygen saturation improved from 88 % (pre-dose) to 96 % (post-dose). All patients were weaned off oxygen within Avg + SD : 6.53 ± 2.09 days post-Itolizumab treatment.

Three patients (12%) did not show improvement in ordinal sore of which two patients died because of complications due to pre-existing comorbidities. The all-cause mortality of 8%; was considered not related to Itolizumab. One infusion related event reported abated with infusion period extension. Interpretation and Conclusion A single dose of Itolizumab accelerated recovery in adult patients with COVID-19 by controlling immune hyperactivation. The clinical improvement was demonstrated by reduction in inflammatory markers, weaning off oxygen, reduced length of hospital stay and improvement of ordinal score. Itolizumab was well tolerated and when administered in the early phase of the inflammatory cascade is an efficient therapeutic option for treatment of cytokine release syndrome in moderate to severe COVID-19 patients.","Gore, Vishal; Kshirsagar, Dinesh P; Bhat, Shreepad M; Khatib, Khalid I; Mansukhani, Bhavna",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,579,17

METHODS The study included 15 patients scheduled for elective carotid endarterectomy. The carotid sheath block was performed after ultrasound-guided localization of the carotid bifurcation (level C4-C6) at the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A mix of 7.5 mL ropivacaine 0.75%, 7.5 mL prilocaine1% and 3 mL iopromidum was injected at the base of the carotid bifurcation. An additional 15 mL of the mixture was administered subcutaneously at the surgical incision line. Thirty minutes after the block, a computed tomography scan of the head, neck region and upper thorax was performed to reconstruct a 3-D distribution of the injectate. RESULTS All patients achieved C2-C4 dermatomal sensory blockade. None required conversion to general anesthesia. The injectate spread ranged from the vertebral body of C1 to the vertebral body of T3. The mean volume of distribution was 97±13 mL, the craniocaudal spread 138±19 mm, dorsoventral 57±8 mm and coronal 53±8 mm. The mean carotid artery circumference contact was 252°±77, with four patients (27%) presenting with a ring formation (360°) around the carotid artery. CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound-guided carotid sheath block provided an extensive spread of local anesthetic. A complete ring formation of local anesthetic around the artery does not seem necessary for a successful anesthesia. The resulting nerve blockade thus appears sufficient for surgery, with minor risks compared to blind methods.","Casutt, Mattias; Breitenmoser, Ivo; Werner, Lennart; Seelos, Robert; Konrad, Christoph","Heart, lung and vessels",579,29

In Group 2, on the other hand, the sigmoid colon was divided from the middle with LigaSure LS1200 probe and its distal was closed with LigaSure. In both groups, the proximal sigmoid colon was entered by means of colostomy with 4/0 silk to the left part of the abdomen. Operation durations, adhesion levels and explosion pressures were recorded. Tissue samples were taken for tissue hydroxyproline level. RESULTS While the average duration of the operation was 25.7 minutes in Group 1, it was 18.8 minutes in Group 2 and the difference between them was significant in favour of LigaSure. (p<0.001). Stump explosion pressure was 181.4 (160-190) mmHg in average in the suture group (Group 1), and 173.3 (150-190) mmHg in the LigaSure group (Group 2) and the difference between them was not statistically significant. Tissue hydroxyproline level was 123.6 (13-232) in Group 1, and 123.3 (32-216) in Group 2 and no significant difference was determined between the groups.

Serological survey is an useful tool for vulnerability mapping in an infectious disease pandemic. The aim of the current study was to assess seroprevalence of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 and its determinants among HCWs of a tertiary healthcare facility of India. It was an observational study, cross-sectional in design conducted among 919 HCWs of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, Bihar, India during September, 2020. In results, IgG seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 among the study subjects was 13.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 11.2-15.6%]. In univariate logistic regression analysis; gender, occupation, place of posting, use of full personal protective equipment (PPE), prior corona virus disease (COVID)-19 infection, influenza like illness (ILI), use of steam inhalation, consumption of azithromycin, zinc and vitamin C were the significant attributes which affected the IgG seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2. In the multivariable logistic regression model; occupation, place of posting, prior COVID-19 infection and ILI were significant determinants of IgG seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2. To conclude, majority of the HCWs were found to be IgG seronegative for SARS-CoV-2.

Good veterinary governance is a necessary condition for sustainable economic development insomuch as it promotes the effective delivery of services and improves the overall performance of animal health systems. This article defines governance in Veterinary Services and proposes a framework for its measurement. It also discusses the role of Veterinary Services and analyses the governance dimensions of the performance-assessment tools developed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). These tools (OIE PVS Tool and PVS Gap Analysis) track the performance of Veterinary Services across countries (a harmonised tool) and over time (the PVS Pathway). The article shows the usefulness of the OIE PVS Tool for measuring governance, but also points to two shortcomings, namely (i) the lack of clear outcome indicators, which is an impediment to a comprehensive assessment of the performance of Veterinary Services, and (ii) the lack of specific measures for assessing the extent of corruption within Veterinary Services and the extent to which demand for better governance is being strengthened within the animal health system. A discussion follows on the drivers of corruption and instruments for perception-based assessments of country governance and corruption. Similarly, the article introduces the concept of social accountability, which is an approach to enhancing government transparency and accountability, and shows how supply-side and demand-side mechanisms complement each other in improving the governance of service delivery. It further elaborates on two instruments--citizen report card surveys and grievance redress mechanisms--because of their wider relevance and their possible applications in many settings, including Veterinary Services. Also, central to improving transparency and accountability is access to information and a discussion on the appropriate level of decentralisation of Veterinary Services. Bringing Veterinary Services into compliance with OIE international standards would contribute to improving governance and providing economic benefits through increased animal productivity, the expansion of trade and improved food security. It would also help to increase public health benefits, through greater food safety and better prevention and control of zoonoses.","Msellati, L; Commault, J; Dehove, A",Revue scientifique et technique,579,18

The cotton rat is classified in the family Cricetidae (with hamsters and gerbils) and is a distant cousin of the common laboratory rat (Rattus) classified in the family Muridae (with the common laboratory mouse, Mus). Antibody reagents that are specific for cotton rat immunoglobulins have not been described. To enhance the usefulness of this model, four immunoglobulins in Sigmodon serum were characterized (IgG1, IgG2, IgA, IgM) and antisera specific for each immunoglobulin were made. Sera from three different species of Sigmodon were examined, S. hispidus (SH), S. arizoni (SA) and S. fulviventer (SF). Although IgA and IgM appeared similar in all three species, the IgG were expressed differently because normal serum levels of IgG2 were deficient in SH when compared with SA and SF and to other rodents. Similarly, IgG2 antibody response to purified protein antigen was deficient in SH although the IgG1 antibody response was superior to that in SF and SA. The three cotton rat species were infected with respiratory syncytial virus, and the kinetics of the antibody response was measured. Neutralizing antibody developed faster and to a higher titre in SH than in SA and SF. The enhanced immunoresponsiveness in SH may compensate for the IgG2 deficiency in SH and these changes appear to be relatively recent events in the evolution of this most populous species of Sigmodon.","Coe, J E; Prince, G A",Immunology,579,22

While active templates in vitro were able to accumulate in vivo, some very weak templates in vitro were also able to accumulate in vivo without reversion or second-site alterations. Computer models of hairpin structure indicated that biologically active promoters could have hairpins less stable than wild type, with loops of variable length and sequence, and without a need for a 6-base single-stranded tail. In addition, transcripts containing compensatory exchanges in the upper stem region that had limited activity in vitro were biologically active in vivo, indicating that positioning of specific bases in the stem is not required to produce an active minus-strand promoter.","Stupina, V; Simon, A E",Virology,579,20

In 1999, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommended that a network of immunisation registers be established in Canada. The Canadian Immunization Registry Network (CIRN) was established to coordinate the development of standards and facilitate the sharing of knowledge and experience to develop a national network of such registers. In 2003, the National Immunization Strategy identified immunisation registers as an important component in improving national immunisation surveillance. In addition, there has been consistent public and professional interest in a national immunisation register being available and considerable progress has been made in developing technologies to facilitate the capture of immunisation-related data. More specifically, the automated identification of vaccines, through the use of barcodes on vaccines, will facilitate collection of data related to administered vaccine doses. Nevertheless, challenges remain in the implementation of immunisation registers in all Canadian provinces and territories such that Canada still does not currently have a fully functional network of immunisation registers with the capacity to be interoperable between jurisdictions and to allow for data to be captured at the national level.","Laroche, J A; Diniz, A J",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,579,9

MATERIAL AND METHOD manual review of books and other documents on diabetes mellitus in Spain was conducted. In addition, a specific research of articles published using MeSH terms diabetes mortality, prevalence, incidence, cost, inequalities and Spain was conducted in Medline through Internet (PubMed). Minimun Basic Data Set was utilized as source for complication description by Communities Autonomus. RESULTS DM is one of the leading cause of mortality and the third one in women. With regard to Autonomous Communities, Canary Islands, Ceuta y Melilla and Andalusia show the greatest mortality with a downward trend. Diabetics present greater mortality than non diabetic patients, being complications the main cause of the over-mortality, especially ischemic heart disease. Estimations of prevalence for DM2 range from 4.8% to 18.7% and for DM1, from .08% to .2%. In pregnancy, it has been noted a prevalence ranging from 4.5% to 16.1%. With respect to incidence per year, it is estimated a range from 146 to 820 per 100,000 inhabitants for DM2 and a range from 10 to 17 new cases annually per 100,000 inhabitants for DM1. Costs for DM1 show very different results, averaging between 1,262 and 3,311 euro per people and year. There are differences for DM2 costs as well, averaging between 381 and 2,560 euro per patient and year. Total costs estimated range from 758 to 4,348 euro per person and year. Relationship between a low socioeconomic level (LSL) and DM2 risk has been proved. Moreover, it has been noted that the less LSL the worse is the disease control, coupled with a greater frequency and more frequent factors of DM2 risk. CONCLUSIONS The knowledge about the situation of the DM as a Public Health problem in Spain is limited. Mortality data available does not gather its real magnitude, and prevalence, incidence, costs and inequalities research are very poor and hardly comparable. In spite of this degree of incertitude, we can state that DM is an important public health problem with a continuous increase, especially DM2, if the appropriate prevention and control measures are not taken.","Ruiz-Ramos, Miguel; Escolar-Pujolar, Antonio; Mayoral-Sánchez, Eduardo; Corral-San Laureano, Florentino; Fernández-Fernández, Isabel",Gaceta sanitaria,579,22

The Patient Care Enhancement System (PACES) is a form of electronic medical records presently in service in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). We assess the feasibility of PACES data for surveillance, describe time-trends, and identify methods of sub-analysis which could improve performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS Medical consults from July 2000 to June 2003 were extracted. Diagnosis codes were mapped to 7 infectious disease syndromes according to the categorisation in the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE): gastrointestinal (GI), fever (FEVER), respiratory, (RESP), coma (COMA), neurological (NEURO), dermatologic-haemorrhagic (DERMHEM) and dermatologic- infectious (DERM-INF). RESULTS A total of 732,233 episodes of care were analysed. Weekly periodicity was observed, with decreased weekend consults; there were no obvious seasonal trends in any of the syndromes. RESP, FEVER and GI syndromes were common events. Sub-analyses, either by restricting to cases with a repeated consultation, or grouping the data by medical centres, could dramatically lower thresholds used to flag outbreaks. CONCLUSION In spite of the level of background noise inherent in a system consisting mainly of primary care consults, sub-analysis by medical centre, or restriction to cases with repeated consults were able to yield sensitive thresholds for outbreak detection.","Ang, B C H; Chen, M I C; Goh, T L H; Ng, Y Y; Fan, S W","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",579,10

METHODS Thirteen prenatally diagnosed CC patients from 1997 to 2015 were included. Seven patients (1997-2008) underwent open surgery (OS group), and 6 (2009-2015) underwent laparoscopic surgery (LS group). In the asymptomatic patients, LS was performed when the patients weighed over 5 kg. When the patient had clinical manifestations, early LS was performed irrespective of body weight. A retrospective comparison was conducted between the LS and OS groups in terms of the operative time, blood loss, postoperative fasting period, hospital stay, and intra- and postoperative complications. RESULTS There was no difference between the demographics of both groups. The operative time was significantly longer (380 vs. 288 min) and blood loss was significantly lower (4 vs. 30 mL) in the LS group. Additionally, the postoperative fasting period (3 vs. 6 days) and hospital stay (11 vs. 20 days) were significantly shorter in the LS group. Intraoperative events and early postoperative complications were not encountered in either group. Small bowel obstruction requiring surgery occurred in two patients, 10 and 13 years after OS, respectively. CONCLUSIONS LS is as safe and feasible as OS in small children with prenatally diagnosed CC, although sufficient pediatric laparoscopic expertise is mandatory.","Matsumoto, Mariko; Urushihara, Naoto; Fukumoto, Koji; Yamoto, Masaya; Miyake, Hiromu; Nakajima, Hideaki",Surgery today,579,1

To understand the mechanism of this effect, we have analyzed the transcriptional profiles of primary human fibroblast cells that were first treated with IFN-beta1, IFN-gamma, or a combination of both and then subsequently infected with HSV-1. We have identified two types of synergistic activities in the gene expression patterns induced by IFN-beta1 and IFN-gamma that may contribute to inhibition of HSV-1 replication. The first is defined as ""synergy by independent action,"" in which IFN-beta1 and IFN-gamma induce distinct gene categories. The second, ""synergy by cooperative action,"" is a term that describes the positive interaction between IFN-beta1 and IFN-gamma as defined by a two-way analysis of variance. This form of synergy leads to a much higher level of expression for a subset of genes than is seen with either interferon alone. The cooperatively induced genes by IFN-beta1 and IFN-gamma include those involved in apoptosis, RNA degradation, and the inflammatory response. Furthermore, the combination of IFN-beta1 and IFN-gamma induces significantly more apoptosis and inhibits HSV-1 gene expression and DNA replication significantly more than treatment with either interferon alone. Taken together, these data suggest that IFN-beta1 and IFN-gamma work both independently and cooperatively to create an antiviral state that synergistically inhibits HSV-1 replication in primary human fibroblasts and that cooperatively induced apoptosis may play a role in the synergistic effect on viral replication.","Peng, Tao; Zhu, Jia; Hwangbo, Yon; Corey, Lawrence; Bumgarner, Roger E",Journal of virology,579,20

OBJECTIVE To determine the epidemiological features, course, and outcomes of patients with SARS-related critical illness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Retrospective case series of 38 adult patients with SARS-related critical illness admitted to 13 intensive care units (ICUs) in the Toronto area between the onset of the outbreak and April 15, 2003. Data were collected daily during the first 7 days in the ICUs, and patients were followed up for 28 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was mortality at 28 days after ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included rate of SARS-related critical illness, number of tertiary care ICUs and staff placed under quarantine, and number of health care workers (HCWs) contracting SARS secondary to ICU-acquired transmission. RESULTS Of 196 patients with SARS, 38 (19%) became critically ill, 7 (18%) of whom were HCWs. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of the 38 patients was 57.4 (39.0-69.6) years. The median (IQR) duration between initial symptoms and admission to the ICU was 8 (5-10) days. Twenty-nine (76%) required mechanical ventilation and 10 of these (34%) experienced barotrauma. Mortality at 28 days was 13 (34%) of 38 patients and for those requiring mechanical ventilation, mortality was 13 (45%) of 29. Six patients (16%) remained mechanically ventilated at 28 days. Two of these patients had died by 8 weeks' follow-up. Patients who died were more often older, had preexisting diabetes mellitus, and on admission to hospital were more likely to have bilateral radiographic infiltrates. Transmission of SARS in 6 study ICUs led to closure of 73 medical-surgical ICU beds. In 2 university ICUs, 164 HCWs were quarantined and 16 (10%) developed SARS. CONCLUSIONS Critical illness was common among patients with SARS. Affected patients had primarily single-organ respiratory failure, and half of mechanically ventilated patients died.

Serial interval, which is defined as the time between symptom onsets in an infector-infectee pair, and the incubation period are key parameters in determining the control strategies for COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate surveillance of HCWs and estimate the serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 149 HCWs and 36 certain infector-infectee pairs between 19th March 2020 and 1st November 2020 in a university hospital were included in the study. Epidemiological characteristics were recorded. Serial interval and incubation period were estimated using parametric accelerated failure time models. RESULTS: Forty HCWs (26.8%) were detected via contact-based surveillance. Of 100 HCWs epidemiologically linked with a confirmed COVID-19 case, 36 (36%) had contact with a colleague. The median serial interval was 3.93 days (95% CI: 3.17-4.83). Of symptomatic HCWs, 97.5% had developed symptoms 13.71 (95% CI: 9.39-18.73) days after symptom onset of the primary case. The median incubation period was 3.99 (95% CI: 3.25-4.84) days. Of symptomatic HCWs, 97.5% developed symptoms within 9.49 (95% CI: 6.75-12.20) days after infection. CONCLUSIONS: The serial interval and the incubation period of COVID-19 in HCWs were shorter than in the general population. Rigorous contact tracing and isolation of infected HCWs could have resulted in shorter serial intervals. Implementation of more stringent in-hospital control measures focussed on transmission between HCWs should be considered.","Emecen, Ahmet Naci; Basoglu Sensoy, Ecem; Sezgin, Edanur; Yildirim Ustuner, Buket; Keskin, Salih; Siyve, Neslisah; Celik, Saadet Goksu; Bayrak, Gamze; Senturk Durukan, Nurcan; Coskun Beyan, Ayse; Ergor, Alp; Unal, Belgin; Ergor, Gul",Infect Dis (Lond),579,26

We report on the compliance with the COVID-19 vaccine of pts affected by solid tumors. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cancer pts afferent to Medical Oncology-1-Unit of Regina Elena National-Cancer-Institute in Rome were considered eligible for vaccination if they were receiving systemic immunosuppressive antitumor treatment, or received it in the last 6 months, or having an uncontrolled advanced disease. The Pfizer-BNT162b2 vaccine was proposed to all candidates by phone contact or during a scheduled visit. Reasons of refusal were collected by administrating a 6-items-multiple-choice questionnaire. RESULTS From March 1st to 20th,2021, out 914 eligible pts 102 refused vaccination (11.2%,95%CI9.1-13.2). The most frequent (&gt;10%) reasons reported were concerns about vaccine-related adverse events (48.1%), negative interaction with concomitant antitumor therapy (26.7%) and the fear of allergic reaction (10.7%). The refusal rate (RR) after March 15th (date of AstraZeneca-AZD1222 suspension) was more than doubled compared to the RR observed before (19.7%vs8.6%,OR2.60,95%CI1.69-3.99,p&lt;0.0001)(Fig.1B). ECOG-PS 2 was associated with higher RR compared with ECOG-PS 0-1(OR2.94,95%CI1.04-8.34,p=0.04). No statistically significant differences in RR according to other clinical characteristics were found. CONCLUSIONS Our experience represents the first worldwide report on the adherence of cancer-pts to COVID-19 vaccination and underlines how regulatory decisions and media news-spreading could influence the success of the campaign.","Di Noia, Vincenzo Renna Davide Barberi Vittoria Dicivita Mattia Riva Federica Costantini Giulia Aquila Emanuela Dell’ Russillo Michelangelo Bracco Domenico La Malfa Antonia Marina Giannarelli Diana Cognetti Francesco",European Journal of Cancer,579,7

However, the nutritional status of COVID-19 patients has not yet been extensively examined. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the nutritional status of COVID-19 patients and to identify factors independently associated with malnutrition risk. METHODS: In this single-center, cross-sectional study, we analyzed data from 760 hospitalized COVID-19 patients between 29 January 2020 and 15 March 2020. Based on the Nutrition Risk Screening (NRS) 2002 score, we divided patients into the normal nutrition group (NRS score <3) and the malnutrition risk group (NRS score &#8805;3). The associations of age, gender, symptoms, comorbidities, BMI, serum albumin and prealbumin concentrations, disease severity, activities of daily living (ADL) score, and clinical outcomes with malnutrition risk were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with malnutrition risk. RESULTS: Of patients with COVID-19, 82.6% were at risk of malnutrition. There were statistical differences in the age, incidence of fever, BMI, serum albumin and prealbumin concentrations, ADL score, and disease severity between the 2 groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that age &#8805;65 y (vs. <65 y; OR: 5.40; P < 0.001), serum albumin <35 g/L (vs. &#8805;35 g/L; OR: 3.61; P < 0.001), serum prealbumin <150 mg/L (vs. &#8805;150 mg/L; OR: 2.88; P = 0.042), critical cases (vs. moderate cases; OR: 4.46; P < 0.001), ADL score 41-60 (vs. ADL score 100; OR: 4.50; P = 0.012), and ADL score &#8804;40 (vs. ADL score 100; OR: 9.49; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with the risk of malnutrition in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that prevalence of malnutrition risk was high in COVID-19 patients. Older age, low serum albumin and prealbumin concentrations, ADL score <60, and disease severity were independent factors associated with malnutrition risk.","Liu, Aihong; Cong, Jingjing; Wang, Qiong; Mei, Yuxin; Peng, Yingjie; Zhou, Meng; Zhu, Wenli; Chen, Xiaoqing; Guan, Wenjing; He, Ping",J. nutr,579,2

There is no existing literature that focuses on such impact on RD organisations in any jurisdictions, nor RD populations across multiple jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to RD organisations between April and May 2020. Quantitative and qualitative data on the impact of COVID-19 on RD organisations and patients were collected from the organisation representative's perspective. Qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis. A follow-up focus group meeting was conducted in August 2020 to validate the survey findings and to discuss specific needs, support and recommendations for sustainable healthcare systems during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 80 RD organisations from Australia, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, India, Japan, mainland China, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan participated in the study. Of all, 89% were concerned about the impact of pandemic on their organisations. Results indicate that 63% of the organisations functioned at a reduced capacity and 42% stated a decrease in funding as their biggest challenge. Overall, 95% believed their patients were impacted, particularly in healthcare access, social lives, physical health, psychological health and financial impact. Specifically, 43% identified the reduced healthcare access as their top impact, followed by 26% about the impact on daily living and social life. Focus group meeting discussed differential impact across jurisdictions and point towards telemedicine and digitalisation as potential solutions. CONCLUSIONS: This serves as the first study to assess the impact of COVID-19 on RD patients and organisations across multiple jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region, identifying major themes on the impact on both RD patients and organisations. By including 80 organisations from ten jurisdictions, our study presents the most comprehensive assessment of the pandemic's impact to date. It highlights the need for mental health support and sheds light on moving towards telemedicine and digitalisation of organisation operation, which constitutes a sustainable model in times of pandemics and beyond.","Chung, Claudia Ching Yan; Ng, Yvette Nga Chung; Jain, Ritu; Chung, Brian Hon Yin",Orphanet J Rare Dis,579,16

Serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) is frequently found elevated in severe SARS-CoV2 infection, which indicates skeletal muscle damage precipitating limb weakness or even ventilatory failure. CASE PRESENTATION: We addressed such a patient in his forties presented with features of severe SARS-CoV2 pneumonia and high serum CPK. He developed severe sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and received intravenous high dose corticosteroid and tocilizumab to counter SARS-CoV2 associated cytokine surge. After 10 days of mechanical ventilation (MV), weaning was unsuccessful albeit apparently clear lung fields, having additionally severe and symmetric limb muscle weakness. Ancillary investigations in addition with serum CPK, including electromyogram, muscle biopsy, and muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested acute myopathy possibly due to skeletal myositis. CONCLUSION: We wish to stress that myopathogenic medication in SARS-CoV2 pneumonia should be used with caution. Additionally, serum CPK could be a potential marker to predict respiratory failure in SARS-CoV2 pneumonia as skeletal myopathy affecting chest muscles may contribute ventilatory failure on top of oxygenation failure due to SARS-CoV2 pneumonia.","Islam, Badrul; Ahmed, Mohiuddin; Islam, Zhahirul; Begum, S M",Skelet Muscle,579,16

Despite no restriction over the platelet donation activities, plateletpheresis donors became apprehensive regarding the possible risk of spread of the COVID-19 during the platelet donation and in the hospital premises. Many of them started hesitating for platelet donations. With this, the blood center started having an acute shortage of platelets. Various confidence-building steps were implemented by the blood center to promote voluntary plateletpheresis. The blood center staff and individual donors were educated to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The donor organizations and plateletpheresis donors were informed about the steps to be taken by the blood center during the donation and necessary steps for the prevention of the possible spread of COVID-19. With the help of these measures, the confidence of the individual platelet donors and the donor organizations was restored in the blood center and regular plateletpheresis was continued. These measures may also be useful to other blood centers in the COVID-19 pandemic and this experience may be useful if a similar pandemic lockdown happens in the future.","Ojha, Shashank; Gupta, Abhaykumar Malind; Nagaraju, P; Poojary, Minal; S H, Sumathi",Transfus Apher Sci,579,24

In this study, we addressed the epidemic characteristics, driving factors, prevention and control measures of influenza A, a more common epidemic. In addition, we reviewed the global efforts on how to prevent and control influenza effectively and related scientific research achievements, which aims to provide experience and suggestions for the prevention and control of COVID-19. The results show that: (1) Influenza A is a seasonal epidemic, affected by climatic, social political, cultural factors and others. It is more contagious in low-temperature, low-humidity, densely populated environment. (2) The prevention and control of influenza A mainly includes seasonal influenza virus surveillance, influenza virus ecological studies, broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies and universal vaccines, as well as the etiological assessment of influenza pandemic risk. Seasonal influenza virus surveillance is the core of public health policy formulation and follow-up scientific research. (3) Similar to influenza A, the prevalence of COVID-19 is affected by climate factors such as temperature, as well as social, political, cultural and other factors, which needs to draw the lessons from the mature experience, technologies and platforms of influenza. The combination of multiple actions, such as strengthening virus surveillance, conducting further research on virus ecology and etiological risk assessment and drug discovery is essential for early warning and prediction of the possible secondary wave of epidemics in the future.

METHODS: We used the TriNetX platform to analyze 20 health care institutions that have relevant, up-to-date encounter data. Using this COVID and Cancer Research Network (CCRN), we compared cancer cohorts identified by querying encounter data pre-COVID (January 2019-April 2019) and current (January 2020-April 2020). Cohorts were generated for all patients with neoplasms (malignant, benign, in situ, and of unspecified behavior), with new incidence neoplasms (first encounter), with exclusively malignant neoplasms, and with new incidence malignant neoplasms. Data from a UK institution were similarly analyzed. Additional analyses were performed on patients with selected cancers, as well as on those having had cancer screening. RESULTS: Clear trends were identified that suggest a significant decline in all current cohorts explored, with April 2020 displaying the largest decrease in the number of patients with cancer having encounters. Of the cancer types analyzed, lung, colorectal, and hematologic cancer cohorts exhibited smaller decreases in size in April 2020 versus 2019 (-39.1%, -39.9%, -39.1%, respectively) compared with cohort size decreases for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma (-47.7%, -49.1%, -51.8%, respectively). In addition, cancer screenings declined drastically, with breast cancer screenings dropping by -89.2% and colorectal cancer screenings by -84.5%. CONCLUSION: Trends seen in the CCRN clearly suggest a significant decrease in all cancer-related patient encounters as a result of the pandemic. The steep decreases in cancer screening and patients with a new incidence of cancer suggest the possibility of a future increase in patients with later-stage cancer being seen initially as well as an increased demand for cancer screening procedures as delayed tests are rescheduled.","London, Jack W; Fazio-Eynullayeva, Elnara; Palchuk, Matvey B; Sankey, Peter; McNair, Christopher",JCO Clin Cancer Inform,579,26

METHODS: A total of 12 150 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (publicly available) from 69 countries were analysed. Mutational clusters were assessed by hierarchical clustering. Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) was used to select the best inhibitors of 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL-Pr) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) among the FDA-approved drugs and to evaluate the impact of mutations on binding affinity of these drugs. The impact of mutations on epitope recognition was predicted following Grifoni et al. (Cell Host Microbe 2020. 27: 671-80.). RESULTS: Thirty-five key mutations were identified (prevalence: &#8805;0.5%), residing in different viral proteins. Sixteen out of 35 formed tight clusters involving multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins, highlighting intergenic co-evolution. Some clusters (including D614GSpike + P323LRdRp + R203KN + G204RN) occurred in all continents, while others showed a geographically restricted circulation (T1198KPL-Pr + P13LN + A97VRdRp in Asia, L84SORF-8 + S197LN in Europe, Y541CHel + H504CHel + L84SORF-8 in America and Oceania). SBVS identified 20 best RdRp inhibitors and 21 best 3CL-Pr inhibitors belonging to different drug classes. Notably, mutations in RdRp or 3CL-Pr modulate, positively or negatively, the binding affinity of these drugs. Among them, P323LRdRp (prevalence: 61.9%) reduced the binding affinity of specific compounds including remdesivir while it increased the binding affinity of the purine analogues penciclovir and tenofovir, suggesting potential hypersusceptibility. Finally, specific mutations (including Y541CHel + H504CHel) strongly hampered recognition of Class I/II epitopes, while D614GSpike profoundly altered the structural stability of a recently identified B cell epitope target of neutralizing antibodies (amino acids 592-620). CONCLUSIONS: Key genetic elements reflect geographically dependent SARS-CoV-2 genetic adaptation, and may play a potential role in modulating drug susceptibility and hampering viral antigenicity. Thus, a close monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 mutational patterns is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of treatments and vaccines worldwide.","Salpini, Romina; Alkhatib, Mohammad; Costa, Giosuè; Piermatteo, Lorenzo; Ambrosio, Francesca Alessandra; Di Maio, Velia Chiara; Scutari, Rossana; Duca, Leonardo; Berno, Giulia; Fabeni, Lavinia; Alcaro, Stefano; Ceccherini-Silberstein, Francesca; Artese, Anna; Svicher, Valentina",J. antimicrob. chemother,579,21

The pandemic dynamics of COVID-19 needs to be studied in detail. A pandemic model with hierarchical quarantine and time delay is proposed in this paper. In the COVID-19 case, the virus incubation period and the antibody failure will cause the time delay and reinfection, respectively, and the hierarchical quarantine strategy includes home isolation and quarantine in hospital. These factors that affect the spread of COVID-19 are well considered and analyzed in the model. The stability of the equilibrium and the nonlinear dynamics is studied as well. The threshold value &#964; k of the bifurcation is deduced and quantitatively analyzed. Numerical simulations are performed to establish the analytical results with suitable examples. The research reveals that the COVID-19 outbreak may recur over a period of time, which can be helpful to increase the number of tested people with or without symptoms in order to be able to early identify the clusters of infection. And before the effective vaccine is successfully developed, the hierarchical quarantine strategy is currently the best way to prevent the spread of this pandemic.","Yang, Wei",Dyn Games Appl,579,16

METHODS: We used for training and validation an ensemble of ten convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with mainly bedside CXRs of 250 COVID-19 and 250 non-COVID-19 subjects from two hospitals (Centres 1 and 2). We then tested such system on bedside CXRs of an independent group of 110 patients (74 COVID-19, 36 non-COVID-19) from one of the two hospitals. A retrospective reading was performed by two radiologists in the absence of any clinical information, with the aim to differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients. Real-time polymerase chain reaction served as the reference standard. RESULTS: At 10-fold cross-validation, our deep learning model classified COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients with 0.78 sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.81), 0.82 specificity (95% CI 0.78-0.85), and 0.89 area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI 0.86-0.91).

RESULTS: 231,498/2,474,066(9%) contacts of 1,064,004 index cases tested PCR-positive. PCR-positive results in contacts independently increased with higher case viral loads (lower Ct values) e.g., 11.7%(95%CI 11.5-12.0%) at Ct=15 and 4.5%(4.4-4.6%) at Ct=30. B.1.1.7 infection increased PCR-positive results by ~50%, (e.g. 1.55-fold, 95%CI 1.49-1.61, at Ct=20). PCR-positive results were most common in household contacts (at Ct=20.1, 8.7%[95%CI 8.6-8.9%]), followed by household visitors (7.1%[6.8-7.3%]), contacts at events/activities (5.2%[4.9-5.4%]), work/education (4.6%[4.4-4.8%]), and least common after outdoor contact (2.9%[2.3-3.8%]). Contacts of children were the least likely to test positive, particularly following contact outdoors or at work/education. The most and least sensitive LFDs would detect 89.5%(89.4-89.6%) and 83.0%(82.8-83.1%) of cases with PCR-positive contacts respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infectivity varies by case viral load, contact event type, and age. Those with high viral loads are the most infectious. B.1.1.7 increased transmission by ~50%. The best performing LFDs detect most infectious cases.","Lee, Lennard Y W; Rozmanowski, Stefan; Pang, Matthew; Charlett, Andre; Anderson, Charlotte; Hughes, Gareth J; Barnard, Matthew; Peto, Leon; Vipond, Richard; Sienkiewicz, Alex; Hopkins, Susan; Bell, John; Crook, Derrick W; Gent, Nick; Walker, A Sarah; Peto, Tim E A; Eyre, David W",Clin. infect. dis,579,1

Spreading globally, it is now considered pandemic, with approximately 3 million cases worldwide at the end of April. Its symptoms include fever, cough, and headache, but the main one is shortness of breath. In turn, it is believed that there is a relationship between COVID-19 and damage to the heart muscle, and hypertensive and diabetic patients, for example, seem to have worse prognosis. Therefore, COVID-19 may worsen in individuals with underlying adverse conditions, and a not negligible number of patients hospitalized with this virus had cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. Systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression may be behind this association. In addition, the virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) receptors, more precisely ACE2, to penetrate the cell; therefore, the use of ACE inhibitor drugs and angiotensin receptor blockers could cause an increase in these receptors, thus facilitating the entry of the virus into the cell. There is, however, no scientific evidence to support the interruption of these drugs. Since they are fundamental for certain chronic diseases, the risk and benefit of their withdrawal in this scenario should be carefully weighed. Finally, cardiologists and health professionals should be aware of the risks of infection and protect themselves as much as possible, sleeping properly and avoiding long working hours.","Ferrari, Filipe",Arq Bras Cardiol,579,26

Police departments are also increasingly consumers of surveillance technologies that are created, sold, and controlled by private companies. They exercise an undue influence over police today in ways that are not widely acknowledged and increasingly play a role in the data capture and processing that feeds into larger cloud infrastructures and data markets. These developments are having profound effects on how policing is organized and on existing power relations, whereby decisions are increasingly being made by algorithms. Although attention is paid to algorithmic police surveillance in academic research as well as in mainstream media, critical discussions about its democratic oversight are rare. The goal of this paper is to contribute to ongoing research on police and surveillance oversight and to question how current judicial oversight of algorithmic police surveillance in Belgium addresses socio-technical harms of these surveillance practices.","van Brakel, R.",Surveillance &amp; Society,579,19

The Authors investigated how the drastic changes in daily activities modified the epidemiology of hand trauma lesions. Methods: The Authors analyzed the characteristics of hand and wrist traumatic disorders during the months of February and March comparing 2019 to 2020. Collected data included age distribution, traumatic etiology, diagnosis and type of surgical procedures. Results: The total number of orthopedic and trauma patients significantly decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 (3360 vs 1470). The number of hand and wrist injuries didn't show a significant difference between 2019 and 2020 instead (192 vs 131). The overall number of patients hospitalized and surgically treated at our Operative Unit (OU) was 168 in 2019 and 120 in 2020. Male patients resulted prevalent (60,7â¯M vs 39,3F/2019; 63,2â¯M vs 36,8F/2020). In terms of patient age, in 2020 we registered a significant reduction of cases in the 20-35-year-old age group and a significant increase in the 51-65 and 66-80-year-old age groups. Traffic-related, sport-related and fortuitous injuries significantly decreased in 2020, while the number of domestic accidents significantly increased. Analyzing the Hospital Discharge Records (HDR), we found a significant increase in the number of proximal and middle phalanx fractures; no significant differences were found for other kinds of discharge diagnosis. As for the choice of surgical treatment options, no differences were found between 2019 and 2020. Conclusion: Even during drastic movement restrictions and the prolonged suspension of work and leisure activities secondary to COVID-19 epidemic in 2020, hand and wrist traumas rate remained almost the same compared to the same period of the previous year. Nevertheless, a significant change in the etiology and patient age was registered. In fact, sport and traffic-related traumas decreased respect to domestic traumas, while the previous prevalent involvement of young adults was surpassed by accidental hand traumas in the elderly and active adults.","Andrea, Poggetti; Andrea, Del Chiaro; Maria, Nucci Anna; Chiara, Suardi; Sandra, Pfanner",,579,8

The expression of these receptors on the ocular surface is unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gene expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors was investigated in conjunctival epithelial cell samples and in ex-vivo cornea samples using microarray or transcriptome sequencing. RESULTS: ACE2 is expressed in conjunctival samples at a low level, while BSG and TMPRSS2 are expressed at intermediate levels in both conjunctiva and cornea. Other receptors such as ANPEP, AGTR2 are expressed at low level in the conjunctiva. Two RNA editing enzymes involved in antiviral responses, APOBEC3A, and ADAR-1 were also highly expressed. CONCLUSIONS: The ocular surface may represent an entry point for the SARS-CoV-2 in the human body. The conjunctiva and the cornea can adopt antiviral countermeasures which may explain the low prevalence of eye involvement.","Leonardi, Andrea; Rosani, Umberto; Brun, Paola",Ocul Immunol Inflamm,579,16

The occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has been reported to be as high as 43%. This is comparable to AKI in other forms of pneumonia requiring hospitalization, as well as in non-infectious conditions like cardiac surgery. The impact of AKI on COVID-19 outcomes is difficult to assess at present but, similar to other forms of sepsis, AKI is strongly associated with hospital mortality. Indeed, mortality is reported to be very low in COVID-19 patients without AKI. Given that AKI contributes to fluid and acid-base imbalances, compromises immune response and may impair resolution of inflammation, it seems likely that AKI contributes to mortality in these patients. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of AKI in COVID-19 are thought to be multifactorial including systemic immune and inflammatory responses induced by viral infection, systemic tissue hypoxia, reduced renal perfusion, endothelial damage and direct epithelial infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. Mitochondria play a central role in the metabolic deregulation in the adaptive response to the systemic inflammation and are also found to be vital in response to both direct viral damage and tissue reperfusion. These stress conditions are associated with increased glycolysis and reduced fatty acid oxidation. Thus, there is a strong rationale to target AKI for therapy in COVID-19. Furthermore, many approaches that have been developed for other etiologies of AKI such as sepsis, inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion, have relevance in the treatment of COVID-19 AKI and could be rapidly pivoted to this new disease.","Kellum, John A; van Till, J W Olivier; Mulligan, George",Nephrol Dial Transplant,579,15

Primary-care providers are rapidly adopting telehealth modalities for care provisions during this unprecedented pandemic to allow practices to continue delivering primary care while preventing community spread of COVID-19. Federal legislation has responded to emergent public-health needs by removing barriers that have impeded widespread adoption of telehealth modalities. This legislation has omitted professional registered nurses (RNs) from delivering reimbursable telehealth services, which is problematic for primary-care practice. RNs historically have led telehealth service delivery and should therefore be included in new legislation as eligible health professionals permitted to provide reimbursable telehealth services.

en la década de los 70&#039;s, que significa &quot;curar a distancia&quot; La Telemedicina consiste en el uso de las tecnologías de la información y la comunicación (TIC) para mejorar los resultados en la salud de los pacientes, aumentando el acceso a la atención médica y la información (Castillejo y Antonio 2013) La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) define a la telemedicina, como el aporte de servicios de salud, donde la distancia es un factor crítico, por cualquier profesional de salud, usando las nuevas tecnologías de la comunicación para el intercambio válido de información en el diagnóstico, tratamiento y la prevención de enfermedades o lesiones, investigación y evaluación, y educación continuada de los proveedores de salud, todo con el interés de mejorar la salud de los individuos y sus comunidades (World Health Organization 2010;WHO Group Consultation on Health Telematics (1997: Geneva 1998) En el contexto de la pandemia del COVID-19, su rápida diseminación y la alta probabilidad de contagio dentro de las instituciones de salud, han generado que se preste atención al uso de la telemedicina Las ventajas del uso de la telemedicina, en la pandemia del COVID-19,son: 1) puede limitar la exposición del personal de salud a pacientes potencialmente infectados, 2) puede reducir la exposición de pacientes con morbilidades, como asma, inmunodeficiencias, a pacientes infectados y 3) puede permitir una rápida evaluación de infecciones potenciales de COVID-19, reduciendo de esta manera, la probabilidad que estos pacientes infectados vayan al centro de salud y expongan a más personas al virus (Shaker et al , s f ) La telemedicina permitiría una comunicación de 24/7 entre los médicos y los pacientes, empleando cualquier dispositivo tecnológico disponible (Hollander y Carr 2020) Finalmente, se debe tener en claro, que esta aproximación virtual, como la telemedicina, no debe reemplazar el manejo cínico en-persona en todos los casos METODOS: Con la finalidad de evitar el contacto persona-persona entre los médicos y los pacientes, en un escenario como el de la pandemia de COVID-19, se ha propuesto el uso videoconsultas médicas (Greenhalgh et al 2020) De esta manera, luego, de la confirmación de un caso positivo, la telemedicina puede emplearse en la monitorización remota de estos casos, empleando video conferencias entre el médico y el paciente, cuando este último se encuentre en cuarentena domiciliaria (Zhai et al 2020) Las video consultas también podrían emplearse para realizar un &quot;triaje hacia adelante&quot;al paciente (en inglés forward triage), es decir hacer una evaluación anticipada antes de que el paciente llegue al servicio de emergencia A esto se le conoce como telemedicina directa al consumidor, esto permitiría, en el caso del COVID-19, establecer una autocuarentena anticipada, protegiendo a los pacientes y al personal que se encuentran en los centros de salud (Hollander y Carr 2020) RESULTADOS: En general, dentro de los beneficios brindados por el sistema ETCS se tiene que, durante el 28 de enero del 2018 al 17 de febrero 2020, se atendieron por telemedicina 63 casos severos y 591 casos leves y moderados El servicio de nube de la telemedicina permitió, dentro de las salas de aislamiento, recopilar y evaluar de manera efectiva los datos de salud del paciente, como presión arterial, nivel de oxígeno, entre otros Esto redujo el contacto directo con el paciente infectado, evitando una posible transmisión al personal de salud También facilitó el trabajo multidisciplinario de especialistas en el tratamiento y manejo de los pacientes infectados Y además logró, que el equipo especializado en el tratamiento de COVID-19, brindara una capacitación masiva al personal de salud de todos los hospitales conectados al sistema CONCLUSIÓN: La telemedicina durante la pandemia de COVID-19, puede ser considerada como una herramienta para el seguimiento y manejo de casos positivos A través, de vide llamadas o llamadas telefónicas, el personal de salud puede hacer un seguimiento activo del desarrollo de la enfermedad en los pacientes afectados por el COVID 19 Pese a que a la fecha no se cuenta con estudios que evalúen la utilidad de la telemedicina en el contexto de la pandemia por COVID-19, los beneficios del uso de la telemedicina son ampliamente conocidos en países desarrollados, donde se emplea para el manejo de varias condiciones médicas, e incluso enfermedades infecciosas (Pham y Badowski 2019) La habilitación de un sistema de monitoreo remoto requerirá el establecimiento de protocolos de trabajo detallados, donde se especifiquen si el número de llamadas o video conferencias dependerá del riesgo de complicaciones que tenga el paciente, considerando su edad y si vive sólo o con otros familiares El paciente debe comprender que esta opción de manejo clínico será igual de efectiva que aquella que se lleva a cabo en un centro de salud de persona a persona, para que el sistema pueda funcionar Además, es necesario asegurar el soporte informático, y estructural para brindar una atención continúa y de buena calidad También se deben establecer mecanismos de regulación que supervisen la implementación del sistema de telemedicina, con el objetivo de asegurar que todos los casos de COVID-19, mantenidos en cuarentena domiciliaria no sufran complicaciones posteriores que puedan ocasionar la muerte del paciente Finalmente, es importante indicar que la implementación de herramientas tecnológicas en el monitoreo de pacientes estará restringido a regiones donde el acceso a servicios de luz, telefonía y/o internet sea permanente;y donde la población cuente con las herramientas tecnológicas, línea telefónica y/o teléfono inteligente, que permitan al médico

This review will focus on patients with diseases in which immunosuppression is a vital part of the treatment regimen, including those with solid organ transplants, rheumatologic disorders, sarcoidosis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We will summarize the current knowledge of immunosuppression in these diseases and the risk of contracting COVID-19. Furthermore, we will discuss if immunosuppression increases severity of COVID-19 presentation. RECENT FINDINGS: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number patients receiving chronic immunosuppression have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our understanding of the immunology of SARS-CoV-2 is advancing at a rapid pace. Currently, a number of clinical trials are underway to investigate the role of immunosuppressive treatments in the management of this disease. SUMMARY: Currently, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that solid organ transplant recipients on chronic immunosuppression are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Solid organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes but the data are not consistent. There is evidence to suggest that patients with rheumatologic disorders or IBDs are not at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and do not necessarily experience worse clinical outcomes. Patients with sarcoidosis are not necessarily at increased risk of COVID-19, although there is limited data available to determine if immunosuppression worsens outcomes in this population.","Manansala, Michael; Baughman, Robert; Novak, Richard; Judson, Marc; Sweiss, Nadera",Curr Opin Pulm Med,579,16

Various techniques or methods such as PET, ECG, EMG, MRI exist to detect and quantify stress. Physiological features produced throughout the brain’s electrical activity are documented by a medical technique known as an electroencephalogram (EEG). In this context, this paper posits a comparative analysis of the above-described methods of stress detection and accentuates on stress detection methodology using EEG signals, as EEG is a perfect non-invasive tool, widely used in clinical and research domains. The fractal dimension (FD) method, which is an indicator of curve irregularities, has been used in the detection of stress for feature extraction, applying three FD algorithms viz. Higuchi, Katz and Permutation Entropy. For classification, this study aims to apply and compare a number of classic machine learning algorithms based on accuracy, precision and sensitivity. This paper also presents a novel architecture, based on EEG analysis in MATLAB, fractal dimension used for feature extraction along with Machine Learning processes for classification i.e., Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network which is useful for early-stage stress detection, analyzing different stress levels viz. mild, moderate and high accuracy and providing ways for people to cope with stress in order to enhance their performance.","Agrawal, Jharna Gupta Manish Garg Hitendra",IOP Conference Series.

We report a data-independent acquisition method, Scanning SWATH, that accelerates mass spectrometric (MS) duty cycles, yielding quantitative proteomes in combination with short gradients and high-flow (800 µl min-1) chromatography. Exploiting a continuous movement of the precursor isolation window to assign precursor masses to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragment traces, Scanning SWATH increases precursor identifications by ~70% compared to conventional data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods on 0.5-5-min chromatographic gradients. We demonstrate the application of ultra-fast proteomics in drug mode-of-action screening and plasma proteomics. Scanning SWATH proteomes capture the mode of action of fungistatic azoles and statins. Moreover, we confirm 43 and identify 11 new plasma proteome biomarkers of COVID-19 severity, advancing patient classification and biomarker discovery. Thus, our results demonstrate a substantial acceleration and increased depth in fast proteomic experiments that facilitate proteomic drug screens and clinical studies.","Messner, Christoph B; Demichev, Vadim; Bloomfield, Nic; Yu, Jason S L; White, Matthew; Kreidl, Marco; Egger, Anna-Sophia; Freiwald, Anja; Ivosev, Gordana; Wasim, Fras; Zelezniak, Aleksej; Jürgens, Linda; Suttorp, Norbert; Sander, Leif Erik; Kurth, Florian; Lilley, Kathryn S; Mülleder, Michael; Tate, Stephen; Ralser, Markus",Nat. biotechnol,579,14

However, the incidence and clinical relevance of this relation remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the incidence, severity and clinical impact of acute pancreatitis in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of a prospective, observational cohort concerning all COVID-19 patients admitted to two Dutch university hospitals between 4 March 2020 and 26 May 2020. Primary outcome was acute pancreatitis potentially related to COVD-19 infection. Acute pancreatitis was defined according to the revised Atlanta Classification. Potential relation with COVID-19 was defined as the absence of a clear aetiology of acute pancreatitis. RESULTS: Among 433 patients with COVID-19, five (1.2%) had potentially related acute pancreatitis according to the revised Atlanta Classification. These five patients suffered from severe COVID-19 infection; all had (multiple) organ failure and 60% died. None of the patients developed necrotizing pancreatitis. Moreover, development of acute pancreatitis did not lead to major treatment consequences. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous research, our study demonstrated that COVID-19 related acute pancreatitis is rare and of little clinical impact. It is therefore debatable if acute pancreatitis in COVID-19 patients requires specific screening. We hypothesize that acute pancreatitis occurs in patients with severe illness due to COVID-19 infection as a result of transient hypoperfusion and pancreatic ischemia, not as a direct result of the virus.","Bulthuis, Margo C; Boxhoorn, Lotte; Beudel, Martijn; Elbers, Paul W G; Kop, Marnix P M; van Wanrooij, Roy L J; Besselink, Marc G; Voermans, Rogier P",Scand J Gastroenterol,579,24

This study aims to systematically examine the housing and health problems of vulnerable groups using a bibliometric approach to explore how housing causes health problems, types of health illnesses, and coping strategies. It is found that the poor housing mechanism, persistent inequalities, and poor housing environments have a significant impact on the health of vulnerable groups. Therefore, the government must make concerted efforts across all sectors to ensure that the housing and health care needs of vulnerable groups are improved, and that housing security standards and related policies are improved; targeted safety plans are formulated with community as the carrier, taking into account the characteristics of vulnerable groups; and new information technology is widely used to provide medical convenience for vulnerable groups. It is hoped that the research in this paper can arouse social attention to the health of vulnerable groups and improve their health from the perspective of housing, so as to point out the direction for solving the housing health problems of vulnerable groups in the future.","Chen, Junhua; Hao, Shuya; Wu, Ying",Rev. environ. health,579,0

In Study 2 (N = 68), participants made moral decisions before and after observing the decisions of a prosocial or antisocial peer. Peer observation caused participants' own preferences to resemble those of their peers. This peer influence effect on value computation manifested as an increased weight on choice attributes promoting the peers' goals that occurred independently from peer influence on initial choice bias. Participants' self-reported awareness of influence tracked more closely with computational measures of prosocial than antisocial influence.

MATERIAL AND METHODS From 20 January 2020 to 2 February 2020, 6 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 1 male and 5 females, were retrospectively reviewed in Zhejiang Hospital. These cases were clinically assessed and classified as common COVID-19. All patients underwent thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) within 2 days after the onset of symptoms, and their images were viewed by 2 radiologists who were blind to their clinical records. RESULTS CT images of 6 confirmed patients were collected. Two of the 6 patients (33.3%) had bilateral lung involvements and 4 (66.7%) had single-lung involvement. Two cases (33.3%) had a single lesion, 2 cases (33.3%) had 2 lesions, and 2 cases (33.3%) had multiple lesions. There were 2 cases (33.3%) with focal subpleural distribution and 1 case (16.7%) along the bronchial vascular bundle. Five cases (83.3%) had ground-glass opacities, 4 cases (66.7%) had ground-glass nodules, 1 case (16.7%) had thickened lobular septum, 2 cases (33.3%) had thickened bronchial wall, 2 cases (33.3%) had halo sign,1 case (16.7%) had crazy-paving sign, and 1 case (16.7%) had tree-in-bud sign. CONCLUSIONS The imaging manifestations of early-stage COVID-19 are relatively mild, and the imaging findings of some patients are not typical, which can easily lead to missed diagnoses.

SARS-CoV-2, a RNA single-stranded virus, has been detected in the amniotic fluid, in the cord blood and in the placentas of the infected women. In the light of these findings, the theoretical risk of intrauterine infection for fetuses, or of peripartum infection occurring during delivery for neonates, has a biological plausibility. The extent of this putative risk might, however, vary during the different stages of pregnancy, owing to several variables (physiological modifications of the placenta, virus receptors' expression, or delivery route).

METHODS: Descriptive study of a series of cases of patients scheduled for endoscopy during the month of May 2020, when endoscopic activity was resumed after the peak of the pandemic, following SCD, SEED, AEG and ESGE recommendations. We examined nasopharyngeal samples 48-72 hours before the appointment, by RT-PCR, in all patients. RNA extraction was performed using the kits: Qiagen®-adapted, BiosSprint®96-DNA-Blood-Kit (384). For amplification-detection of SARS-CoV-2, methods recommended by the WHO and the CDC were followed. RESULTS: 110 asymptomatic patients without close contact with a positive case in the previous 14 days were scheduled; 105 (96.4%) were negative and five (4.5%) were positive. Two patients developed respiratory symptoms after diagnosis (presymptomatic) and three remained asymptomatic. Allfive5 patients were autochthonous cases with no history of travel or residence in another city or country associated with high prevalence of infection. Four cases were women aged 60-81 years.

Nodes can join and leave the network at any time or they can move to different spatial locations. %operating at multiple spatial and temporal scales. In this scenario, monitoring spatial and temporal properties plays a key role in understanding of how complex behaviors can emerge from local and dynamic interactions. We propose here the Spatio-Temporal Reach and Escape Logic, (STREL), a logic-based formal language designed to express and monitor spatio-temporal requirements over the execution of mobile and spatially distributed CPS. STREL considers the physical space in which CPS entities (nodes of the graph) are arranged as a weighted graph representing their dynamic topological configuration. Both nodes and edges have attributes modelling physical and logical quantities that can evolve over time. STREL combines the Signal Temporal Logic with two spatial modalities reach and escape that operate over the weighted graph. From these basic operators, we can derive other important spatial modalities such as everywhere, somewhere and surround. We propose both a qualitative and quantitative semantics based on constraint semirings, an algebraic structure suitable for constraint satisfaction and optimisation. We provide an offline monitoring algorithm for STREL and we show the feasibility of our approach with the application to two case studies: monitoring spatio-temporal requirements over a simulated mobile ad-hoc sensor network and a simulated epidemic spreading model for COVID19.","Bartocci, E.; Bortolussi, L.; Nenzi, L.; Loreti, M.",,579,1

To combat this, administration of high dose vitamin C (ascorbic acid or ascorbate), in addition to the standard conventional supportive treatments, has been shown in literature as a safe and effective therapy for severe cases of respiratory viral infections. Morbidity, mortality, infectiveness, and spread of infectious diseases are dependent on the host-pathogen relationship. Given the lack of effective and safe anti-viral drugs for coronaviruses, there should be more attention in supporting host immune defense, cytoprotection, and immunoregulation. The implementation of a high dose of vitamin C therapy could dramatically reduce the need for high doses of corticosteroids, antibacterial and anti-viral drugs that may be immunosuppressive, adrenal depressive, and toxic, complicating the disease course. In order to effectively fight the novel virus, medical professionals should explore readily available pharmaceutical and nutritional therapeutic agents with proven antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immune-supportive properties.

Here, we sought to validate the MSL-COVID-19 score, originally developed to predict COVID-19 mortality in Mexicans. Also, an adaptation of the formula is proposed for the prediction of COVID-19 severity in a triage setting (Nutri-CoV). METHODS: We included patients evaluated from March 16th to August 17th, 2020 at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición, defining severe COVID-19 as a composite of death, ICU admission or requirement for intubation (n = 3,007). We validated MSL-COVID-19 for prediction of mortality and severe disease. Using Elastic Net Cox regression, we trained (n = 1,831) and validated (n = 1,176) a model for prediction of severe COVID-19 using MSL-COVID-19 along with clinical assessments obtained at a triage setting. RESULTS: The variables included in MSL-COVID-19 are: pneumonia, early onset type 2 diabetes, age > 65 years, chronic kidney disease, any form of immunosuppression, COPD, obesity, diabetes, and age <40 years. MSL-COVID-19 had good performance to predict COVID-19 mortality (c-statistic = 0.722, 95%CI 0.690-0.753) and severity (c-statistic = 0.777, 95%CI 0.753-0.801). The Nutri-CoV score includes the MSL-COVID-19 plus respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry. This tool had better performance in both training (c-statistic = 0.797, 95%CI 0.765-0.826) and validation cohorts (c-statistic = 0.772, 95%CI 0.0.745-0.800) compared to other severity scores.

COVID-19 originates from a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the scientific community is faced with the daunting task of creating a novel model for this pandemic or, in other words, creating novel science. This paper is the first part of a series of two papers that explore the intricate relationship between the different challenges that have hindered biomedical research and the generation of scientific knowledge during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: During the early stages of the pandemic, research conducted on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was chaotic and sparked several heated debates with respect to the scientific methods used and the quality of knowledge generated. Research on HCQ is used as a case study in both papers. The authors explored biomedical databases, peer-reviewed journals, pre-print servers, and media articles to identify relevant literature on HCQ and COVID-19, and examined philosophical perspectives on medical research in the context of this pandemic and previous global health challenges. RESULTS: This paper demonstrates that a lack of prioritization among research questions and therapeutics was responsible for the duplication of clinical trials and the dispersion of precious resources. Study designs, aimed at minimising biases and increasing objectivity, were, instead, the subject of fruitless oppositions. The duplication of research works, combined with poor-quality research, has greatly contributed to slowing down the creation of novel scientific knowledge.

DESIGN: Single-center retrospective review using data from patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requiring intubation. SETTING: Tertiary-care center in Indianapolis, IN, United States. PATIENTS: Patients hospitalized at international units Health Methodist Hospital with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requiring intubation between March 23, 2020, and April 8, 2020, who underwent ultrasound evaluation for venous thrombosis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 45 patients were included. Nineteen of 45 patients (42.2%) were found to have deep venous thrombosis. Patients found to have deep venous thrombosis had no difference in time to intubation (p = 0.97) but underwent ultrasound earlier in their hospital course (p = 0.02). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were similar between the groups on day of intubation and day of ultrasound (p = 0.44 and p = 0.07, respectively). D-dimers were markedly higher in patients with deep venous thrombosis, both for maximum value and value on day of ultrasound (p < 0.01 for both). Choice of prophylactic regimen was not related to presence of deep venous thrombosis (p = 0.35). Ultrasound evaluation is recommended if D-dimer is greater than 2,000 ng/mL (sensitivity 95%, specificity 46%) and empiric anticoagulation considered if D-dimer is greater than 5,500 ng/mL (sensitivity 53%, specificity 88%). CONCLUSIONS: Deep venous thrombosis is very common in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. There was no difference in incidence of deep venous thrombosis among different pharmacologic prophylaxis regimens, although our analysis is limited by small sample size. D-dimer values are elevated in the majority of these patients, but there may be thresholds at which screening ultrasound or even empiric systemic anticoagulation is indicated.","Trigonis, Russell A; Holt, Daniel B; Yuan, Rebecca; Siddiqui, Asma A; Craft, Mitchell K; Khan, Babar A; Kapoor, Rajat; Rahman, Omar",Crit Care Med,579,26

OBJECTIVES: To examine the managerial challenges, actions taken, and insights of directors of ophthalmology departments in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional survey of directors of ophthalmology departments during the COVID-19 pandemic while the Israeli population was quarantined. RESULTS: All 21 directors answered the survey. The majority of the COVID-19 admissions were located in the center of Israel (53%) and Jerusalem (30%). E-communication took a central role in coping with the pandemic with 80% of the directors satisfied with this form of communication; 75% reported a reduction in clinical and surgery volume of at least 25%, and 40% reported reallocations of manpower. Most of the medical staff used gloves, a face shield, disposable robe, and a mask with no uniformity across departments. Cross satisfaction was noted regarding a hospital's ability to equip the departments. Lack of preparation for post-pandemic era was reported by all directors, but one (95%). Directors sought guidelines and uniformity regarding outpatient referral to the hospital (p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines via safe digital platforms aid in management decisions and uniformity across departments. Advanced preparation is needed to prevent adverse clinical outcomes and to maintain treatment continuum.

The mediating and moderating mechanisms underlying this association are also unknown. Based on a nationally representative sample of migrant adolescents, this study examined whether school engagement mediated the association between teacher discrimination and depression, and whether the direct and mediating effects were moderated by poverty. Our sample comprised 2041 migrant adolescents (46.2% female) from the first two waves of the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS). The results indicated that teacher discrimination (T1) was positively associated with depression (T2). Emotional engagement with school (T1) rather than cognitive engagement with school (T1) partially mediated this association. Moreover, poverty status moderated the direct association between teacher discrimination and migrant adolescents' depression as well as the indirect relationship via emotional school engagement. Specifically, the direct and indirect effects were stronger for migrant adolescents living in poverty than they were for their non-impoverished counterparts.

METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 were given an IL6ri (sarilumab or tocilizumab) based on iteratively reviewed guidelines. IL6ri were initially reserved for critically ill patients, but after review, treatment was liberalized to patients with lower oxygen requirements. Patients were divided into two groups: those requiring &#8804;45% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (termed stage IIB) and those requiring >45% FiO2 (termed stage III) at the time of IL6ri administration. The main outcomes were all-cause mortality, discharge alive from hospital, and extubation. RESULTS: A total of 255 COVID-19 patients were treated with IL6ri (149 stage IIB and 106 stage III). Patients treated in stage IIB had lower mortality than those treated in stage III (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-0.74). Overall, 218 (85.5%) patients were discharged alive. Patients treated in stage IIB were more likely to be discharged (aHR 1.43, 95% CI 1.06-1.93) and were less likely to be intubated (aHR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24-0.79). CONCLUSIONS: IL6ri administration prior to >45% FiO2 requirement was associated with improved COVID-19 outcomes.

Data were collected on demographic characteristics, lifestyle changes during the quarantine period, and the psychological impact of the lock-down on adolescents' life. RESULTS: Most adolescents experienced feelings of fear, discouragement, and anxiety which strongly affected the approach to their daily lifestyles. Most of the surveyed subjects reported having used this period to acquire new skills and to practice physical activities at home. The use of technology was predominant both for recreational activities and educational purposes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the strong psychological impact of the quarantine, adolescents showed good levels of resilience.

The ""new normal"" we are living in to defend ourselves against this tiny yet dangerous enemy has serious repercussions on children's lives. This becomes even more evident if we think of those children who are doubly vulnerable - they are even more fragile because they live in conditions of particular hardship when they live outside their family, have a disability, or live in poverty. Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have witnessed the proliferation of numerous initiatives by various national and international children's rights institutions, which have called for urgent measures to protect children's rights. At this precise moment, the concept of the child's best interests is also reinterpreted as a result of a reasonable compression of certain children's rights and the prevalence of others. The present paper will attempt an analytical reconstruction of children's fundamental rights by analyzing how these rights have changed during the pandemic. In fact, it is necessary to know if and/or how much have the rights of minors changed as a result of the emergency. The second part of the paper is dedicated to the question of which children's rights will be most compromised or changed in thepost-Covid-19 era. In reflecting on the inevitable consequences that the pandemic will leave on the delicate balance of the development of children's rights, the author will offer some proposals on how to contain the encountered difficulties.","Winkler, Sandra PhD Assistant Professor",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,579,16

To reduce unproductive picker working time as in traditional picker-to-parts warehousing systems, different solutions are proposed in the literature and in practice. For example, in a mixed-shelves storage policy, items of the same stock keeping unit are spread over several shelves in a warehouse; or automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are used to transport the picked items from the storage area to packing stations instead of human pickers. This is the first paper to combine both solutions, creating what we call AGV-assisted mixed-shelves picking systems. We model the new integrated order batching and routing problem in such systems as an extended multi-depot vehicle routing problem with both three-index and two-commodity network flow formulations. Due to the complexity of the integrated problem, we develop a novel variable neighborhood search algorithm to solve the integrated problem more efficiently. We test our methods with different sizes of instances, and conclude that the mixed-shelves storage policy is more suitable than the usual storage policy in AGV-assisted mixed-shelves systems for both single-line and multi-line orders (saving up to 67% on driving distances for AGVs).

Clinical manifestations and biomarkers in early stages of disease with relevant predictive impact for outcomes remain largely unexplored. We aimed to identify parameters which are significantly different between subgroups. DESIGN: 125 patients with COVID-19 were analysed. Patients with ARDS (N = 59) or non-ARDS (N = 66) were compared, as well as fatal outcome versus survival in the two groups. KEY RESULTS: ARDS and non-ARDS patients did not differ with respect to comorbidities or medication on developing a fatal outcome versus survival. Body mass index was higher in patients with ARDS versus non-ARDS (p = 0.01), but not different within the groups in survivors versus non-survivors. Interleukin-6 levels on admission were higher in patients with ARDS compared to non-ARDS as well as in patients with fatal outcome versus survivors, whereas lymphocyte levels were lower in the different subgroups (all p<0.05).

In recent years, there has been a lot of work incorporating edge features along with node features for prediction tasks. One of the main difficulties in using edge features is that they are often handcrafted, hard to get, specific to a particular domain, and may contain redundant information. In this work, we present a framework for creating new edge features, applicable to any domain, via a combination of self-supervised and unsupervised learning. In addition to this, we use Forman-Ricci curvature as an additional edge feature to encapsulate the local geometry of the graph. We then encode our edge features via a Set Transformer and combine them with node features extracted from popular GNN architectures for node classification in an end-to-end training scheme. We validate our work on three biological datasets comprising of single-cell RNA sequencing data of neurological disease, \textit{in vitro} SARS-CoV-2 infection, and human COVID-19 patients. We demonstrate that our method achieves better performance on node classification tasks over baseline Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) models. Furthermore, given the attention mechanism on edge and node features, we are able to interpret the cell types and genes that determine the course and severity of COVID-19, contributing to a growing list of potential disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","Sehanobish, Arijit; Ravindra, Neal G.; Dijk, David van",,579,16

The COVID-19 emergency, its related global mobility restrictions and fear of hospitalization further highlighted the need of a comprehensive solution. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to design and test a pragmatic e-Health system based on multiparametric telemonitoring to support of TIA/stroke patients in sub-acute phase during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We proposed a telemonitoring system and protocol for TIA/minor stroke patients during COVID-19 pandemic for patients at risk of stroke recurrence. This system involves the use of portable devices for BP/HR/SpO2/temperature sensing, panic-button, gateway, and a dedicated ICT platform. The protocol is a 14-day multiparametric telemonitoring, therapy, and emergency intervention based on vital sign alteration notifications. We conducted a proof-of-concept validation test on 8 TIA/minor stroke patients in the early post-acute phase (< 14 days from ischemic event). RESULTS: The proposed solution allowed to promptly and remotely identify vital sign alterations at home during the early post-acute phase, allowing therapy and behavioral intervention adjustments. Also, we observed a significant improvement of quality of life, as well as a significant reduction of anxiety and depression status. TUQ showed ease of use, good interface quality and high user satisfaction of the proposed solution. The 3-month follow-up showed total adherence of prescribed therapy and no stroke/TIA recurrence or other emergency department admissions. CONCLUSION: The proposed e-Health solution and telemonitoring protocol may be highly useful for early post-acute remote patient management, thus supporting constant monitoring and patient adherence to the treatment pathway, especially during the COVID-19 emergency.","Ajcevic, Milos; Furlanis, Giovanni; Naccarato, Marcello; Caruso, Paola; Polverino, Paola; Marsich, Alessandro; Accardo, Agostino; Manganotti, Paolo",Int J Med Inform,579,16

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter retrospective observational study of patients 18 years hospitalized due to COVID-19 at the Johns Hopkins Health system. Patients who were transferred from another facility with >24 hours stay and patients who died within 48 hours of hospitalization were excluded. METHODS: Elevated PCT values were determined based on each hospitals definition. Antibiotic therapy and PCT results were evaluated for patients with no evidence of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (bCAP) and patients with confirmed, probable, or possible bCAP. The added value of PCT to clinical criteria in detecting bCAP were evaluated with receiving operating curve characteristics (ROC). RESULTS: 64% (611/962) of patients received a PCT. ROC curves for clinical criteria and clinical criteria plus PCT were similar (at 0.5ng/ml and 0.25ng/ml). By bCAP group, median initial PCT values were 0.58 ng/mL (IQR 0.24, 1.14), 0.23 ng/mL (IQR 0.1, 0.63) and 0.15 ng/mL (IQR 0.09, 0.35) for proven/probable, possible, and no bCAP groups. Among patients without bCAP, an elevatedPCT was associated with 1.8 additional days of CAP therapy (95% CI 1.01 2.75, P<0.01) compared to patients with a negative PCT after adjusting for potential confounders. Duration of CAP therapy was similar between patients without a PCT ordered and a low PCT for no bCAP and possible bCAP groups. CONCLUSIONS: PCT may be abnormal in COVID-19 patients without bCAP and may result in receipt of unnecessary antibiotics.","Fabre, Valeria; Karaba, Sara; Amoah, Joe; Robinson, Matthew; Jones, George; Dzintars, Kathryn; Katz, Morgan; Landrum, B Mark; Qasba, Sarojini; Gupta, Pooja; Klein, Eili; Cosgrove, Sara E",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,579,1

METHODS: The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey is an anonymous 74-item survey administered via social media across China. A national sample of 10,545 adults in all 31 provinces in mainland China provided data on sociodemographic characteristics, awareness, attitudes towards COVID-19, lifestyle factors, and health outcomes during the quarantine. Regression models tested associations among study variables adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Among the 9,016 total participants (42.6% men and 57.4% women), 585 reported having diagnosed diabetes and 8,431 had no diabetes. Participants with diabetes perceived themselves to be at higher risk and were more worried about being infected with COVID-19 when compared to non-diabetic individuals (p < 0.001). During the COVID-19 pandemic, participants with diabetes were more likely to experience food and drug shortages and to increase their physical activity, compared to their counterparts. Among diabetic respondents, a high proportion of current smokers (74.1%) and drinkers (68.5%) reported increased amounts of smoking and drinking.

Previous approaches using mathematical programming methods have shown to be effective but are limited by computational costs. In this work, we present PREEMPT, a new approach for intervention via maximizing the influence of vaccinated nodes on the network. We prove submodular properties associated with the objective function of our method so that it aids in construction of an efficient greedy approximation strategy. Consequently, we present a new parallel algorithm based on greedy hill climbing for PREEMPT, and present an efficient parallel implementation for distributed CPU-GPU heterogeneous platforms. Our results demonstrate that PREEMPT is able to achieve a significant reduction (up to 6.75x) in the percentage of people infected and up to 98% reduction in the peak of the infection on a city scale network. We also show strong scaling results of PREEMPT on up to 128 nodes of the Summit supercomputer. Our parallel implementation is able to significantly reduce time to solution, from hours to minutes on large networks.

We have used a bioinformatic approach to aid in designing an epitope peptide-based vaccine against the spike protein of the virus. Five antigenic B cell epitopes with viable antigenicity and a total of 27 discontinuous B cell epitopes were mapped out structurally in the spike protein for antibody recognition. We identified eight CD8+ T cell 9-mers and 12 CD4+ T cell 14-15-mer as promising candidate epitopes putatively restricted by a large number of MHC I and II alleles, respectively. We used this information to construct an in silico chimeric peptide vaccine whose translational rate was highly expressed when cloned in pET28a (+) vector. With our In silico test, the vaccine construct was predicted to elicit high antigenicity and cell-mediated immunity when given as a homologous prime-boost, triggering of toll-like receptor 5 by the adjuvant linker. The vaccine was also characterized by an increase in IgM and IgG and an array of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Upon in silico challenge with SARS-CoV-2, there was a decrease in antigen levels using our immune simulations. We, therefore, propose that potential vaccine designs consider this approach.","Chukwudozie, Onyeka S; Gray, Clive M; Fagbayi, Tawakalt A; Chukwuanukwu, Rebecca C; Oyebanji, Victor O; Bankole, Taiwo T; Adewole, Richard A; Daniel, Eze M",PLoS One,579,16

In this study, we perform support vector regression lesion-symptom mapping using a brain tumor model to test the hypothesis that brain regions specifically involved in lexical retrieval from visual and auditory stimuli represent overlapping neural systems. We find that principal components analysis of language tasks revealed multicollinearity between picture naming, auditory naming, and a validated measure of word finding, implying the existence of redundant cognitive constructs. Nonparametric, multivariate lesion-symptom mapping across participants was used to model accuracies on each of the four language tasks.

Before restrictions were introduced, the random spread of infections as described by the SEIR model grew exponentially. The addition of control measures introduces a mixing of order and disorder in the system's evolution which fall under a different mathematical class of models that can eventually lead to critical phenomena. A generic analytical solution is hard to obtain. We use machine learning to solve the new equations for $i(r,t)$, the infections $i$ in any region $r$ at time $t$ and derive predictions for the spread of infections over time as a function of the strength of the specific measure taken and their duration. The machine is trained in all of the COVID-19 published data for each region, county, state, and country in the world. It utilizes optimization to learn the best-fit values of the model's parameters from past data in each region in the world, and it updates the predicted infections curves for any future restrictions that may be added or relaxed anywhere.

Design/methodology/approach: The research was qualitative, using case study methodology. The case study was about the Brazilian organization Ânima Educação, which is the greatest among the five largest publicly traded education companies in Brazil. Secondary data collection and content analysis was carried out. Findings: As emotional response toward the problems caused by the pandemic, the company's leadership adopted an empathic behavior, allowing traces of its empathic culture to emerge. Empathy was expressed through the implementation of SR practices aimed at workers (policy of not firing in the first two months of the pandemic), at students (provision of technological apparatus, online classes, physical/psychological assistance and negotiation of late fees) and at the society (assistance to the elderly). Originality/value: It was concluded that empathy can be taken as the emotional motivator for companies to engage in SR practices, especially in extreme circumstances in society, as the economic and health challenges that the world is experiencing with the COVID-19 pandemic nowadays. SR practices, in turn, can foster even more empathy in organizations, mobilizing leaders and their respective groups in the creation and implementation of new practices, thus demonstrating that the relationship between empathy and SR practices is a “two-way street”. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Lemos Lourenço, M.; Rosalia Ribeiro Silva, M.; Santana Galvão Oliveira, R.",Social Responsibility Journal,579,20

Speculation about variable effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in obesity likely increases vaccine hesitancy among individuals with obesity, who face not only a higher risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 but also weight stigma, which reduces health care engagement at baseline. Clinical and public health messaging must be data driven, transparent, and sensitive to these biological and sociological vulnerabilities.","Townsend, Matthew J; Kyle, Theodore K; Stanford, Fatima Cody",Obesity (Silver Spring),579,29

Our findings propose more caution in the interpretation of RT-PCR data, promoting, instead, also the quantification of age and sex-based risk factors using HRCT images. Statistical analysis of our methodology reveals a direct relation between intensity, skewness and kurtosis of the radiological features and the gender of patients. Moreover, we investigate the effect of the age of patients on the appearance of COVID-19 pneumonia in the HRCT images. We have also applied our methodology to investigate the effect of time on the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia within the lungs. Subsequently, we find a strong relationship between image analysis and the informed medical diagnosis asserted by the radiologists. Additionally, our results also indicate increase in the severity of lung infection in the first and second week after the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 symptoms. Thereafter, a gradual decrease in the lung damage is observed during the third week. The proposed image analysis methodology can be used as a simple complementary tool for infectious disease diagnostics as demonstrated in this study with an example of SARS-CoV-2 to provide better understanding of the disease for drug and vaccine development.","Asadi, Fariba; Shahnazari, Razieh; Bhalla, Nikhil; Payam, Amir Farokh",,579,10

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Many centers are currently screening surgical patients for COVID-19 using either chest CT, RT-PCR or both, due to the risk for worsened surgical outcomes and nosocomial spread. The optimal design and yield of such a strategy are currently unknown. METHODS: This multicenter study included consecutive adult patients without COVID-19 symptoms who underwent preoperative screening using chest CT and RT-PCR before elective or emergency surgery under general anesthesia. RESULTS: A total of 2093 patients without COVID-19 symptoms were included in 14 participating centers; 1224 were screened by CT and RT-PCR and 869 by chest CT only. The positive yield of screening using a combination of chest CT and RT-PCR was 1.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.8-2.1]. Individual yields were 0.7% (95% CI: 0.2-1.1) for chest CT and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.6-1.7) for RT-PCR; the incremental yield of chest CT was 0.4%. In relation to COVID-19 community prevalence, up to â¼6% positive RT-PCR was found for a daily hospital admission rate >1.5 per 100,000 inhabitants, and around 1.0% for lower prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: One in every 100 patients without COVID-19 symptoms tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with RT-PCR; this yield increased in conjunction with community prevalence. The added value of chest CT was limited. Preoperative screening allowed us to take adequate precautions for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in a surgical population, whereas negative patients needed only routine procedures.","Puylaert, Carl A J; Scheijmans, Jochem C G; Borgstein, Alexander B J; Andeweg, Caroline S; Bartels-Rutten, Annemarieke; Beets, Geerard L; van Berge Henegouwen, Mark I; Braak, Sicco J; Couvreur, Roy; Daams, Freek; van Es, Hendrik W; Franken, Lotte C; Grotenhuis, Brechtje A; Hendriks, Eduard R; de Hingh, Ignace H J T; Hoeijmakers, Fieke; Ten Holder, Joris T; Huisman, Peter M; Kazemier, Geert; van Kesteren, Floortje; van Kesteren, Jurre; Keywani, Kammy; Kuiper, Sara Z; Lange, Maurits D J; Lobatto, Mark E; du Mée, Arthur W F; Poeze, Martijn; van Praag, Elise M; van Rossen, Jorit; van Santvoort, Hjalmar C; Sedee, Wouter J A; Seelen, Leonard W F; Sharabiany, Sarah; Sosef, Nico L; Quanjel, Marian J R; Veltman, Jeroen; Verhagen, Tim; van de Vlasakker, Vincent C J; Weeder, Pepijn D; van Werven, Jochem R; Wesdorp, Nina J; van Dieren, Susan; Han, Alvin X; Russell, Colin A; de Jong, Menno D; Bossuyt, Patrick M M; Quarles van Ufford, Jet M E; Prokop, Mathias W; Gisbertz, Suzanne S; Prins, Jan M",Ann Surg,579,13

This study is aimed at a general surgical audience that may be interested in exploring how mHealth can improve both access and health care quality for surgical patients and their families. We review the current uses of mHealth by surgeons for surgical site infection, new models of the perioperative surgical home, acute care surgical triage, remote patient monitoring devices, and evaluation and management of surgical consultations in the patient's home. We also review institutional and governmental barriers to the adoption of mHealth and offer some preliminary solutions that may aid the surgeon who wishes to implement this technology in their day-to-day practice.","Lesher, Aaron P; Gavrilova, Yulia; Ruggiero, Kenneth J; Evans, Heather L",J Surg Res,579,1

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been listed as an international public health emergency. Clinical first-line nurses are at a high risk of infection, and they face a lack of experience and inadequate preparation for COVID-19, leading to physical and psychological disorders. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted from January to February 2020 at a COVID-19-designated hospital in Wuhan, China. Thirty nurses were selected for the study using a purposive sampling method. Data were collected by semi-structured interviews and analysed using content analysis. RESULTS: Two main categories were defined in the study from the perspective of nurses: negative experiences during clinical first-line work and positive impacts of clinical first-line work. Under the first category, two subcategories were included: psychological experiences of clinical first-line work and difficulties faced during clinical first-line work. The analysis further yielded two subcategories for the second category: the needs of clinical first-line work and the impact of clinical first-line work on professional attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that success depends upon strengthening emergency training and knowledge of infectious diseases for nurses, providing adequate protective equipment and improving the emergency response plans of hospitals for public health emergencies. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: It is believed that our findings will guide hospital managers to make improvements in personal, administrative and institutional areas and that they will provide a reference and inspiration for nurses with regard to public health emergencies in the future.","Tan, Rong; Yu, Ting; Luo, Kaiyan; Teng, Fen; Liu, Yilan; Luo, Jian; Hu, Deying",J. nurs. manag,579,26

The first case of COVID-19 in Singapore was detected on January 23, 2020, and by March 16, a total of 243 cases had been confirmed, including 157 locally acquired cases. Clinical and epidemiologic findings of all COVID-19 cases in Singapore through March 16 were reviewed to determine whether presymptomatic transmission might have occurred. Presymptomatic transmission was defined as the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected person (source patient) to a secondary patient before the source patient developed symptoms, as ascertained by exposure and symptom onset dates, with no evidence that the secondary patient had been exposed to anyone else with COVID-19. Seven COVID-19 epidemiologic clusters in which presymptomatic transmission likely occurred were identified, and 10 such cases within these clusters accounted for 6.4% of the 157 locally acquired cases. In the four clusters for which the date of exposure could be determined, presymptomatic transmission occurred 1-3 days before symptom onset in the presymptomatic source patient. To account for the possibility of presymptomatic transmission, officials developing contact tracing protocols should strongly consider including a period before symptom onset. Evidence of presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 underscores the critical role social distancing, including avoidance of congregate settings, plays in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wei, Wycliffe E; Li, Zongbin; Chiew, Calvin J; Yong, Sarah E; Toh, Matthias P; Lee, Vernon J",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,579,24

The initial number of new cases and new deaths had a positive trend prior to policy change. After lockdown, a statistically significant decrease in new confirmed cases was found in all state capitals. We also found evidence that lockdown measures were likely to reverse the trend of new daily deaths due to COVID-19. In São Luís, we observed a reduction of 37.85% while in Fortaleza the decrease was 33.4% on the average difference in daily deaths if the lockdown had not been implemented.

Vaccines are considered the most powerful measure to fight the pandemic and protect people from COVID-19. Based on the concerted activities of scientists, manufacturers and regulators, the urgent need for effective countermeasures has provoked the development and licensure of novel COVID-19 vaccines in an unprecedentedly fast and flexible manner within <1 year. To ensure the safety and efficacy of these novel vaccines during the clinical development and the routine use in post-licensure vaccination campaigns existing regulatory requirements and procedures had to be wisely and carefully adapted to allow for an expedited evaluation without compromising the thoroughness of the regulatory and scientific assessment. In this review, we describe the regulatory procedures, concepts and requirements applied to guide and promote the highly accelerated development and licensure of safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccines in Europe.","Wagner, Ralf; Meißner, Juliane; Grabski, Elena; Sun, Yuansheng; Vieths, Stefan; Hildt, Eberhard",Allergy,579,20

This can only be achieved by fostering a culture that rewards initiative and empowers inpatient teams to implement and comply with changes which everyone understands and benefits from. The experience of an inner London acute psychiatric unit has shown the value of combining proactive leadership, multidisciplinary decision making and good communication in adapting services to an everchanging environment. Practical solutions have emerged that have improved service delivery and patient care, and which will likely outlast the COVID-19 pandemic. These include changes to team work and routine, streamlining patient care with a focus on goal directed admissions, developing a healthier work environment and adopting novel technology in patient care and multidisciplinary collaboration. KEY POINTS Psychiatric inpatient units have to manage the COVID-19 crisis alongside the risk of acutely disturbed behaviour, while ensuring high standards of care and patient throughput. To respond to the COVID-19 crisis, inpatient units have to foster a culture that rewards initiative and empowers teams to implement and comply with changes that everyone understands and benefits from.

When examining the predominant diseases of the twenty first century landscape, widening health disparities, and significant changes in the United States healthcare system, it is imperative to view wellness and sickness in a broader public health context rather than a singular focus of the biomedical model. While undergraduate opportunities to study public health are on the rise in the United States, there is a parallel urgency for medical curricula to recognize the importance of the complex interrelated socio-ecological root causes of health, well-being, and illness. In order to reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases and increase health equity, it is necessary for medical education to integrate core public health knowledge and competencies. Contemporary health challenges require a public health approach, in addition to clinical skills, for physicians to provide equitable care. The COVID-19 pandemic further underscores the necessity to mitigate the effects of socio-ecological determinants of health. Seven key recommendations are presented from a training to practice timeline emphasizing the important linkages between medical education, socio-ecological influences on health, and public health. As the health challenges in society and communities shift, so too must training of future physicians.

This study assesses the impact on a large acute paediatric hospital service in London, evaluating the trends in the acute paediatric orthopaedic trauma referral caseload and operative casemix before (2019) and during (2020) COVID-19 lockdown.Patients and methods - A longitudinal retrospective observational prevalence study of both acute paediatric orthopaedic trauma referrals and operative caseload was performed for the first 6 ""golden weeks"" of lockdown. These data were compared with the same period in 2019. Statistical analyses included median (± median absolute deviation), risk and odds ratios as well as Fisher's exact test to calculate the statistical significance, set at p &#8804; 0.05.Results - Acute paediatric trauma referrals in 2020 were reduced by two-thirds compared with 2019 (n = 302 vs. 97) with a halving risk (RR 0.55) and odds ratios (OR 0.43) of sporting-related mechanism of injuries (p = 0.002). There was a greater use of outpatient telemedicine in the COVID-19 period with more Virtual Fracture Clinic use (OR 97, RR 84, p < 0.001), and fewer patients being seen for consultation and followed up face to face (OR 0.55, RR 0.05, p < 0.001).Interpretation - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a decline in the number of acute paediatric trauma referrals, admissions, and operations during the COVID period. There has also been a significant change in the patient pathway with more being reviewed via the means of telemedicine to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission and exposure.

The case illustrates the complicated diagnostic struggles that clinicians have encountered during the pandemic and provokes the possibility of COVID19 as a potential risk factor for PCP pneumonia. A 62-year-old female presented to a New York City Hospital in July 2020 with hypoxic respiratory failure. She had a past medical history of coronary artery disease s/p stent and CABG, rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. She was s/p a two month course of antibiotics for sternal wound infection. At presentation, her SpO2 was 75% on room air. She endorsed worsening shortness of breath for 3 weeks. Admission labs were significant for GFR=20, elevated LFTs 2-3xULN, CRP=19.2, troponin=0.5, BNP=45,000 and ANC=1.1. Chest x-ray demonstrated perihilar infiltrates sparing the left upper lobe. She was placed on bipap. COVID19 nasal swab was negative, antibodies were positive. She was intially treated for CHF exaccerbation. During the course of admission, she developed worsening hypoxemia requiring intubation and shock requiring vasopressors. She underwent bronchoscopy with BAL, which revealed lymphocyte count of 42% suspicious for methotrexate toxicity. Steroids were initiated for the treatment of both potential COVID19 and methotrexate toxicity. She developed progressive white out leading to pneumothoraces requiring chest tube insertion. The patient expired. Culture from BAL eventually grew PCP. This patient's case was extremely challenging and introduces thought-provoking questions regarding cooccurrence of PCP and COVID19. There have been a few case reports of PCP coinfection with COVID19. These infections can have significant overlap in terms of the initial imaging and symptoms (bilateral ground glass opacities associated with progressive hypoxemia over weeks). Bronchoscopy is useful for confirming PCP amidst this diagnostic challenge. There has been speculation that lymphopenia associated with COVID19 may result in susceptibility to PCP. PCP infections have commonly been associated with lymphopenia (low CD4) in HIV patients. Most viral infections can predispose patients to fungal and bacterial super-infection. This case raises the question of whether PCP prophylaxis may be considered in patients with COVID19 and other risk factors for development of PCP, such as immunosuppression.","Ramdhanie, L.; Gafoor, K.; Chauhan, S.; Cervellione, K.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,579,20

Sanitary protection measures are not specifically recommended within households. This study examined the risk of seroconversion in cancer patients according to their household exposure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This seroprevalence study was a prevalence study conducted in Torrejon de Ardoz (Spain). It analysed the seroprevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies in 104,299 volunteers (participation rate of 74.8% of population) from 29 May to 05 June 2020. Personal authorisation was requested to collect by questionnaire the test results from cancer patients, who attended the Outpatient Department of the University Hospital of Torrejón, and their cohabitants between 01-19 June 2020. RESULTS: A total of 229 cancer patients were included in the study. Sixty-four of the 229 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (27.9%) and 22 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies (9.6%). The overall seroprevalence (IgG or IgM positive) was 31.4% (general population seroprevalence was 10% in Spain). Of 72 seropositive patients, 54.2% had intrafamilial exposure vs 45.8% who did not. Among seronegative patients, 30.6% had seropositive cohabitants. The probability of seropositivity for a cancer patient was significantly related to intrafamilial exposure (OR 2.684, 95% CI 1.51-4.76, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients are a high-risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The article first reviews how the U.S. government created a legal framework for Global War on Terror detainees that differs from established conventions under international humanitarian law to protect prisoners of war. It discusses the circumstances of a Guantanamo detainee named Mohammed al-Qahtani who was tortured in U.S. custody, according to Guantanamo's top official. The U.S. government has declined to refer legal charges against him but also refused to release him since he has been considered a threat to U.S. national security. The article analyzes how al-Qahtani's attorneys challenged the legality of his detention and referred to an independent psychiatric evaluation played to establish the legal basis for ""irreparable harm."" al-Qahtani's independent psychiatric evaluation asserted that he displayed symptoms consistent with those exhibited by survivors of torture. Legally, the ruling establishes a precedent for Guantanamo detainees who are being held in indefinite detention to compel the U.S. government to clarify their legal status or arrange an examination by a mixed medical commission. Twenty-two other detainees out of the forty still at Guantanamo fall in this legal category, so the precedent has far-reaching consequences.

The transcription factor nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) modulates the functions of the immune cells and alters the gene expression profile of different cytokines in response to various pathogenic stimuli, while many proinflammatory factors have been known to induce NF-&#954;B signalling cascade. Besides, NF-&#954;B has been known to potentiate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to apoptosis in various tissues in many diseases and viral infections. Though the reports on the involvement of the NF-&#954;B signalling pathway in COVID-19 are limited, the therapeutic benefits of NF-&#954;B inhibitors including dexamethasone, a synthetic form of glucocorticoid, have increasingly been realized.

Participants711 participants, mean age 49.5 (SD 12.9, range 18-90). 395 (55.6%) had experienced the death of a parent, 152 (21.4%) a partner. 628 (88.6%) were female and 33 (4.7%) from a minority ethnic background. The mean age of the person who died was 72.2 (SD 16.1, range miscarriage to 102 years). 311 (43.8%) deaths were from confirmed/suspected COVID-19, and 410 (57.8%) deaths occurred in hospital. Main outcome measuresEnd-of-life care experiences (six items, e.g. involvement in care decisions) and pandemic-related challenges before and after death (six items, e.g. unable to visit prior to death). ResultsDeaths in hospital/care home increased the likelihood of: unable to visit prior to death, unable to say goodbye as wanted, limited contact in last days of life (all P<0.001). Deaths in hospice/at home increased the likelihood of: involved in care decisions (P<0.001), well supported by healthcare professionals (HCPs) after the death (P=0.003). Hospice deaths increased the likelihood of being given bereavement support information, which was least likely for care home deaths (P<0.001). Hospital deaths decreased the likelihood of knowing the contact details for the responsible care professional (P=0.001). Bereavement due to COVID-19 decreased the likelihood of: involvement in care decisions (P<0.001), feeling well supported by HCPs after the death (P<0.001), and increased the likelihood of: being unable to say goodbye (OR=0.348; 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.605), social isolation and loneliness (OR=0.439; 95% CI: 0.261 to 0.739), limited contact with relatives/friends (OR=0.465; 95% CI: 0.254 to 0.852). Expected deaths were associated with higher likelihood of feeling involved, informed, and well supported by HCPs (all P<0.001). The deceased being a partner or child increased the likelihood of knowing the contact details for the responsible care professional (P=0.001), being able to visit (P<0.001) and given bereavement support information (P<0.001). Being a bereaved partner strongly increased odds of social isolation and loneliness, e.g. OR = 0.092 (95% CI: 0.028 to 0.297) partner versus distant family member. ConclusionsFour clear risk factors were found for poorer end-of-life care and pandemic-related challenges in bereavement: place, cause and expectedness of death, and relationship to the deceased. O_TEXTBOXWhat is already known on this topic?O_LISince the start of the pandemic, over 20 million family members and friends have been bereaved due to COVID-19, with millions more bereaved due to other causes. C_LIO_LIBereavement of any cause during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with specific challenges, including limited access to people before their death, pressure on health and social care providers, quarantining due to infection or exposure, lockdowns and social distancing. C_LIO_LIThere remains little evidence to inform optimal clinical practice, bereavement support and the policy response to COVID-19 as a mass bereavement event. C_LI What this study addsO_LIOur study highlights four risk factors for poorer end-of-life care and increased risk of pandemic-related challenges in early bereavement: place, cause and expectedness of death and relationship to the deceased. C_LIO_LICOVID-19 deaths, hospital and care home deaths and unexpected deaths were generally associated with poorer outcomes, while being a partner of the person who died (regardless of cause) and bereavement due to COVID-19 increased the odds of experiencing social isolation and loneliness in bereavement. C_LIO_LIThese factors should be taken into account in clinical practice, policy and bereavement support.

This disease has a spectrum of different clinical pictures with different outcomes. Herein, we report all the data from three paucisymptomatic patients during a hospital stay that might represent a paradigmatic example of the method by which SARS-CoV-2 is shed. We demonstrated the lack of an adequate qualitative and quantitative immune response by multiparametric flow cytometry analysis. Our data can provide a new perspective about the method by which SARS-CoV-2 is shed and the clinical weight of viral persistence. In all three cases, the long persistence of the virus and the consistent reduction in both innate and adaptative immune cells are not associated with greater disease severity. These patients might represent at least part of the population. In particular, one patient oscillated between positive and negative swab tests several times without presenting any immune response. In all three cases, the immune response failure was not associated with a clinically significant involvement, indicating that it is not the virus's ability to impair the immune system, as well as its presence and persistence the fundamental mechanism that might causally lead to death. Finally, this kind of immune response in paucisymptomatic patients could pose a considerable danger to public health that questions the quarantine period.

METHODS: Hospitalized children aged < 14 years with ARTIs were enrolled from April 2017 to March 2018; nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected and subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction tests for HMPV. HMPV-positive samples were genotyped based on a partial N gene. Whole genome sequences were determined for samples with high viral loads. RESULTS: 4.08% (52/1276) enrolled paediatric patients were identified as having HMPV infection. The epidemic season is winter and early spring, children aged &#8804; 4 years were more susceptible to HMPV infection (47/52, 90.38%).

Drugs identified in this way may inhibit the entry and replication of pathogens in host cells. The SARS-CoV-2 associated coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has become the most contagious and deadly pandemic disease in the world today. In abeyance of any specific vaccine or therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2, the burgeoning situation urges a need for effective drugs to treat the virus-infected patients. Herbal medicines have been used as natural remedies for treating various infectious diseases since ancient times. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is important for the attachment and pathogenesis of the virus. Therefore, this study focused on the search of useful ligands for S protein among active constituents present in common herbs that could serve as efficient remedies for COVID-19. We analysed the binding efficiency of twelve compounds present in common herbs with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 through molecular docking analysis and also results are validated with two different docking tools. The binding efficiency of ligands was scored based on their predicted pharmacological interactions coupled with binding energy estimates. In docking analysis, compound ""I""(Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)) was found to have the highest binding affinity with the viral S protein, followed by compounds, ""F""(Curcumin),""D""(Apigenin) and ""E""(Chrysophanol). The present study corroborates that compound ""I""(EGCG) mostly present in the integrants of green tea, shows the highest potentiality for acting as an inhibitor of SARSCoV- 2. Further, characterization of the amino acid residues comprising the viral binding site and the nature of the hydrogen bonding involved in the ligand-receptor interaction revealed significant findings with herbal compound ""I""(EGCG) binding to the S protein at eight amino acid residues. The binding sites are situated near to the amino acids which are required for virus pathogenicity. The findings of the present study need in vivo experiments to prove the utility of ""I"", ""F"",""D""and ""E""compounds and their further use in making herb-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 product in near future. This analysis may help to create a new ethno-drug formulation for preventing or curing the COVID-19.","Subbaiyan, Anbazhagan; Ravichandran, Karthikeyan; Singh, Shiv Varan; Sankar, Muthu; Thomas, Prasad; Dhama, Kuldeep; Malik, Yashpal S.; Singh, Raj Kumar; Chaudhuri, Pallab",J.

Relying on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) molecular testing alone cannot reveal the infection proportion, which could play a critical role in vaccination prioritization. We evaluated the utility of a combination orthogonal serological testing (COST) algorithm alongside RT-PCR to quantify prevalence with the aim of identifying candidate patient clusters to receive single and/or delayed vaccination. METHODS: We utilized 108,505 patients with suspected COVID-19 in a retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR vs. IgG-nucleocapsid (IgG&lt;sub&gt;NC&lt;/sub&gt;) antibody testing coverage in routine practice for the estimation of prevalence. Prospectively, an independent cohort of 21,388 subjects was simultaneously tested by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and IgG&lt;sub&gt;NC&lt;/sub&gt; to determine the prevalence. We used 614 prospective study subjects to assess the utility of COST (IgG&lt;sub&gt;NC&lt;/sub&gt;, IgM-spike (IgM&lt;sub&gt;SP&lt;/sub&gt;), and IgG-spike (IgG&lt;sub&gt;SP&lt;/sub&gt;)) in establishing the infection proportion to identify a single-dose vaccination cohort. RESULTS: Retrospectively, we observed a 6.3% (6871/108,505) positivity for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and only 2.3% (2533/108,505) of cases had paired IgG&lt;sub&gt;NC&lt;/sub&gt; serology performed. Prospectively, IgG&lt;sub&gt;NC&lt;/sub&gt; serology identified twice the number of COVID-positive cases in relation to RT-PCR alone.

The regressed suitable puncture area and angle can further navigate the positioning part of VeniBot, which is an important step towards a fully autonomous venipucture robot.

When the damage is chronic, regeneration goes awry, impairing liver function and causing cirrhosis. Hence, cirrhosis may rather be a protective response to injury, where wound-healing processes are set to primarily repair the damaged liver. Although cirrhosis is clinically considered a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), comprehensive population-based studies demonstrate a very modest incidence, refuting the idea that cirrhosis progresses to HCC.

BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 outbreak in China in December of 2019, several studies attempted to identify the epidemiological, viral and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. Given the rapid widespread transmission of the COVID-19 disease worldwide, a more comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of its features is needed to better inform nurses, clinicians and public health policy makers. METHODS: A rapid review and meta-analysis were carried out to identify the main diagnostic features of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients at the time of hospitalisation. All case series, cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies published from 01/01/2020 till 30/06/2020 in English and Chinese that stated all or at least two of the outcomes of interest (clinical features, laboratory and radiological findings) were included. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalence and 95% confidence intervals. Conduction of the review adheres to the PRISMA checklist. RESULTS: 21 studies involving 8837 patients were included in the quantitative synthesis. Fever, cough and fatigue were the most common clinical features, while the most relevant laboratory abnormalities at the time of hospitalisation were lymphopenia, elevated C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase.

A specific type of interaction is that of location-based alerts, where mobile users subscribe to a service provider (SP) in order to be notified when a certain event occurs nearby. Consider, for instance, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where contact tracing has been singled out as an effective means to control the virus spread. Users wish to be notified if they came in proximity to an infected individual. However, serious privacy concerns arise if the users share their location history with the SP in plaintext. To address privacy, recent work proposed several protocols that can securely implement location-based alerts. The users upload their encrypted locations to the SP, and the evaluation of location predicates is done directly on ciphertexts. When a certain individual is reported as infected, all matching ciphertexts are found (e.g., according to a predicate such as""10 feet proximity to any of the locations visited by the infected patient in the last week""), and the corresponding users notified. However, there are significant performance issues associated with existing protocols. The underlying searchable encryption primitives required to perform the matching on ciphertexts are expensive, and without a proper encoding of locations and search predicates, the performance can degrade a lot. In this paper, we propose a novel method for variable-length location encoding based on Huffman codes. By controlling the length required to represent encrypted locations and the corresponding matching predicates, we are able to significantly speed up performance. We provide a theoretical analysis of the gain achieved by using Huffman codes, and we show through extensive experiments that the improvement compared with fixed-length encoding methods is substantial.","Shaham, Sina; Ghinita, Gabriel; Shahabi, Cyrus",,579,24

The aim of the present study was to compare the characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between hospitalized men and women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. This multicenter, retrospective, observational study is based on the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry. We analyzed the differences between men and women for a wide variety of demographic, clinical, and treatment variables, and the sex distribution of the reported COVID-19 deaths, as well as intensive care unit (ICU) admission by age subgroups. This work analyzed 12,063 patients (56.8% men). The women in our study were older than the men, on average (67.9 vs. 65.7 years; p < 001). Bilateral condensation was more frequent among men than women (31.8% vs. 29.9%; p = 0.007). The men needed non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation more frequently (5.6% vs. 3.6%, p < 0.001, and 7.9% vs. 4.8%, p < 0.001, respectively). The most prevalent complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome, with severe cases in 19.9% of men (p < 0.001). In men, intensive care unit admission was more frequent (10% vs. 6.1%; p < 0.001) and the mortality rate was higher (23.1% vs. 18.9%; p < 0.001). Regarding mortality, the differences by gender were statistically significant in the age groups from 55 years to 89 years of age. A multivariate analysis showed that female sex was significantly and independently associated with a lower risk of mortality in our study. Male sex appears to be related to worse progress in COVID-19 patients and is an independent prognostic factor for mortality. In order to fully understand its prognostic impact, other factors associated with sex must be considered.","Josa-Laorden, Claudia; Crestelo-Vieitez, Anxela; García Andreu, María Del Mar; Rubio-Rivas, Manuel; Sánchez, Marcos; Toledo Samaniego, Neera; Arnalich Fernández, Francisco; Iguaran Bermudez, Rosario; Fonseca Aizpuru, Eva Ma; Vargas Núñez, Juan Antonio; Pesqueira Fontan, Paula Maria; Serrano Ballesteros, Jorge; Freire Castro, Santiago Jesús; Pestaña Fernández, Melani; Viana García, Alba; Nuñez Rodriguez, Victoria; Giner-Galvañ, Vicente; Carrasco Sánchez, Francisco Javier; Hernández Milián, Almudena; Cobos-Siles, Marta; Napal Lecumberri, Jose Javier; Herrero García, Virginia; Pascual Pérez, Maria de Los Reyes; Millán Núñez-Cortés, Jesús; Casas Rojo, José Manuel",,579,16

The purpose of this study is to explain how this was nevertheless achieved. Design/methodology/approach: From the perspective of systems theory, social action in principle does not present itself as a problem but as a solution to (latent) social problems. In the sociological analysis presented here, it is therefore precisely a matter of uncovering or pointing out those (changed) social structures in which a social “lockdown” appears as a solution. Findings: The paper explains that with the emergence of social media through applications such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, a new force is establishing itself at the level of society as a system. It is one that is characterized by being highly vulnerable to moral communication. A susceptibility to morality manifests, on the one hand, through an individual differentiation of society made possible by social media – for example, in the emerging Chinese social credit system – and, on the other hand, through the specific communicative structures of the social media themselves. It is argued that social media, in the form of a moral authority with a lasting effect on society as a whole, make a significant contribution to realizing the social “lockdown.” Originality/value: The originality of the paper results from the fact that the emergence of a new social phenomenon (“lockdown”) is explained. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Räwel, J.",Kybernetes,579,10

There is increasing evidence that these patients are at risk for various cardiovascular insults; however, there are currently no guidelines for the diagnosis and management of such cardiovascular complications in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. We share data and recommendations from a multidisciplinary team to highlight our institution's clinical experiences and guidelines for managing cardiovascular complications of coronavirus disease 2019. Design Setting and Patients: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to one of six ICUs dedicated to the care of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 located in three hospitals within one academic medical center in Atlanta, Georgia. Measurements/Interventions: Chart review was conducted for sociodemographic, laboratory, and clinical data. Rates of specific cardiovascular complications were assessed, and data were analyzed using a chi-square or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for categorical and continuous variables. Additionally, certain cases are presented to demonstrate the sub committee's recommendations. Main Results: Two-hundred eighty-eight patients were admitted to the ICU with coronavirus disease 2019. Of these, 86 died (29.9%), 242 (84.03%) had troponin elevation, 70 (24.31%) had dysrhythmias, four (1.39%) had ST-elevation myocardial infarction, eight (2.78%) developed cor pulmonale, and 190 (65.97%) with shock. There was increased mortality risk in patients with greater degrees of troponin elevation (p < 0.001) and with the development of arrhythmias (p < 0.001), cor pulmonale (p < 0.001), and shock (p < 0.001).

While molecular detection tools enable identification of respiratory viruses in wheezing children, it remains unclear if and how these viruses are associated with wheezing. The objective of this systematic review is to clarify the prevalence of different respiratory viruses in children with wheezing. METHODS: We performed an electronic in Pubmed and Global Index Medicus on 01 July 2019 and manual search. We performed search of studies that have detected common respiratory viruses in children &#8804;18 years with wheezing. We included only studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Study data were extracted and the quality of articles assessed. We conducted sensitivity, subgroup, publication bias, and heterogeneity analyses using a random effects model. RESULTS: The systematic review included 33 studies. Rhinovirus, with a prevalence of 35.6% (95% CI 24.6-47.3, I2 98.4%), and respiratory syncytial virus, at 31.0% (95% CI 19.9-43.3, I2 96.4%), were the most common viruses detected. The prevalence of other respiratory viruses was as follows: human bocavirus 8.1% (95% CI 5.3-11.3, I2 84.6%), human adenovirus 7.7% (95% CI 2.6-15.0, I2 91.0%), influenza virus6.5% (95% CI 2.2-12.6, I2 92.4%), human metapneumovirus5.8% (95% CI 3.4-8.8, I2 89.0%), enterovirus 4.3% (95% CI 0.1-12.9, I2 96.2%), human parainfluenza virus 3.8% (95% CI 1.5-6.9, I2 79.1%), and human coronavirus 2.2% (95% CI 0.6-4.4, I2 79.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus may contribute to the etiology of wheezing in children.

The genomes of SARS-COV-2 strains isolated from different parts of the world are now available and the unique features of constituent genes and proteins need to be explored to understand the biology of the virus. Spike glycoprotein is one of the major targets to be explored because of its role during the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. We analyzed 320 whole-genome sequences and 320 spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using multiple sequence alignment. In this study, 483 unique variations have been identified among the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 including 25 nonsynonymous mutations and one deletion in the spike (S) protein. Among the 26 variations detected in S, 12 variations were located at the N-terminal domain (NTD) and 6 variations at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which might alter the interaction of S protein with the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Besides, 22 amino acid insertions were identified in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with that of SARS-CoV. Phylogenetic analyses of spike protein revealed that Bat coronavirus have a close evolutionary relationship with circulating SARS-CoV-2. The genetic variation analysis data presented in this study can help a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

Their glycoproteins (S in CoV, HA in Flu A) and ion channels (E in CoV, M2 in Flu A) are S-acylated. We show that viruses of all genera and from all hosts contain clusters of acylated cysteines in HA, S and E, consistent with the essential function of the modification. In contrast, some Flu viruses lost the acylated cysteine in M2 during evolution, suggesting that it does not affect viral fitness. Members of the DHHC family catalyze palmitoylation. Twenty-three DHHCs exist in humans, but the number varies between vertebrates. SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A proteins are acylated by an overlapping set of DHHCs in human cells. We show that these DHHC genes also exist in other virus hosts. Localization of amino acid substitutions in the 3D structure of DHHCs provided no evidence that their activity or substrate specificity is disturbed. We speculate that newly emerged CoVs or Flu viruses also depend on S-acylation for replication and will use the human DHHCs for that purpose. This feature makes these DHHCs attractive targets for pan-antiviral drugs.","Abdulrahman, D. A.; Meng, X.; Veit, M.",Pathogens,579,26

In addition to the millions of individuals who have been infected with the disease, billions of individuals have been asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on epidemics or traumatic events suggests that this can lead to profound behavioral and mental health changes; however, researchers are rarely able to track these changes with frequent, near-real-time sampling or compare their findings to previous years of data for the same individuals. OBJECTIVE: By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data among college students who have been participating in a longitudinal study for the past 2 years, we sought to answer two overarching questions. First, have the behaviors and mental health of the participants changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous time periods? Second, are these behavior and mental health changes associated with the relative news coverage of COVID-19 in the US media? METHODS: Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students, with 178 (82.0%) students providing data during the Winter 2020 term. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Winter 2020 term compared to previous terms in the same cohort were modeled using mixed linear models. RESULTS: During the first academic term impacted by COVID-19 (Winter 2020), individuals were more sedentary and reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms (P<.001) relative to previous academic terms and subsequent academic breaks. Interactions between the Winter 2020 term and the week of the academic term (linear and quadratic) were significant. In a mixed linear model, phone usage, number of locations visited, and week of the term were strongly associated with increased amount of COVID-19-related news. When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, and phone usage), both anxiety (P<.001) and depression (P=.03) were significantly associated with COVID-19-related news. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with prior academic terms, individuals in the Winter 2020 term were more sedentary, anxious, and depressed. A wide variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer locations visited, were associated with fluctuations in COVID-19 news reporting. While this large-scale shift in mental health and behavior is unsurprising, its characterization is particularly important to help guide the development of methods to reduce the impact of future catastrophic events on the mental health of the population.","Huckins, Jeremy F; daSilva, Alex W; Wang, Weichen; Hedlund, Elin; Rogers, Courtney; Nepal, Subigya K; Wu, Jialing; Obuchi, Mikio; Murphy, Eilis I; Meyer, Meghan L; Wagner, Dylan D; Holtzheimer, Paul E; Campbell, Andrew T",J Med Internet Res,579,12

These efforts can be limited by the requirement for invasive or logistically difficult collection of patient samples such as blood, urine, stool, sputum, and nasopharyngeal swabs. Oral sampling is an appealing, non-invasive alternative that could greatly facilitate high-throughput sampling in community settings. Oral sampling has been described for the detection of dozens of human pathogens, including pathogens whose primary sites of infection are outside of the oral cavity, such as the respiratory pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2. Oral sampling can demonstrate active infections as well as resolving or previous infection, the latter through the detection of antibodies. Its potential applications are diverse, including improved diagnosis in special populations (e.g. children), population surveillance, and infectious disease screening. In this minireview, we address the use of oral samples for the detection of diseases that primarily manifest outside of the oral cavity.

The perceived threat of COVID-19 has the potential to cause severe psychological maladjustment. The aim of the study is to explore Spanish radiographers' concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study was quantitative, observational and cross-sectional. The sample was made up of 546 radiographers working in Spain during the outbreak. The instrument used for analysis was an ad hoc questionnaire with socio-demographic questions and the questionnaire on perception of threat from COVID-19 validate to spanish healthcare professionals. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 70.1% of female, 29.7% of male and 0.2% undeclare sex participants. The results showed a high level of a perceived threat from COVID-19 (7.57 ± 0.088), furthermore we observed a high level of threat about the possibility of infecting family members (8.49 ± 0.25), patients (8.33 ± 0.086), and coworkers (8.35 ± 0.084). Furthermore, females have a higher level of a perception of threat to spread infection between patients (r = -0.136; p = 0.001) and coworkers (r = -0.118; p = 0.006), than males. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic is perceived as a serious threat, being especially concerned about the threat of spreading the infection to family, coworkers, and patients. The perception of risk depends partly on professionals' gender and family responsibilities. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our findings suggest that it is recommended that healthcare professionals receive formation to reinforce and improve their emotional competencies for coping successfully with potentially stressful situations like COVI19 pandemic.","Ruiz, C; Llopis, D; Roman, A; Alfayate, E; Herrera-Peco, I",,579,23

This study aims to assess correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution and CT scores as based on findings from sequential chest CT examinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Thirty patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis underwent chest CT examinations. Five patients who did not have positive CT findings or who had not yet fulfilled criteria for discharge from the hospital were excluded. CT scores were determined according to CT findings and lung involvement. The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment was recorded for each patient, and on the basis of this information, patients with COVID-19 were divided into group 1 (patients for whom this interval was &#8804; 3 days) and group 2 (those for whom this interval was > 3 days). The CT scores for each group were fitted using a Lorentzian line-shape curve to show the variation tendency during treatment. The differences in age, sex, and last CT scores determined before discharge between the two groups were analyzed, and correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution as well as with the highest CT score also underwent statistical analysis. RESULTS. A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in the study. The fitted tendency curves for group 1 and group 2 were significantly different, with peak points showing that the estimated highest CT score was 10 and 16 for each group, respectively, and the time to disease resolution was 6 and 13 days, respectively. The Mann-Whitney test showed that the last CT scores were lower for group 1 than for group 2 (p = 0.025), although the chi-square test found no difference in age and sex between the groups. The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment had a positive correlation with the time to disease resolution (r = 0.93; p = 0.000) as well as with the highest CT score (r = 0.83; p = 0.006).

Expression of Nsp14, a protein involved in viral RNA replication, provoked a dramatic remodeling of the transcriptome that strongly resembled that observed following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, Nsp14 expression altered the splicing of more than 1000 genes and resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of circRNAs, which are linked to innate immunity. These effects were independent of Nsp14 exonuclease activity and the co-factor Nsp10. Activation of the NFkB pathway and increased expression of CXCL8 occurred early upon Nsp14 expression. IMPDH2, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of guanine biosynthesis, was identified as a key mediator of the effect. Nsp14 expression caused an increase in GTP cellular levels, and the effect of Nsp14 was strongly decreased in presence of an IMPDH2 inhibitor. Together, our data demonstrate an unknown role for Nsp14 with implications for therapy.","Zaffagni, Michela; Harris, Jenna M; Patop, Ines L; Pamudurti, Nagarjuna Reddy; Nguyen, Sinead; Kadener, Sebastian",,579,20

Molecular docking of the major seven compounds of essential oil (citronellol, alpha-terpineol, eucalyptol, d-limonene, 3-carene, o-cymene, and alpha-pinene) with Mpro was studied by AutoDock 4.2, and the properties were analysed by PreADMET and Biovia Discovery Studio visualizer. RESULTS: The calculated parameters such as binding energy, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bond interactions of 6LU7 (Mpro) with Eucalyptus and Corymbia volatile secondary metabolites represented its scope as an effective therapy option against covid-19. Among the docked compounds, eucalyptol shows the least binding energy without toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of this study reported that the essential oil of Eucalyptus and Corymbia species, mainly eucalyptol can be utilized as a potential inhibitor against COVID-19 and also it can be used in its treatment. Hence, further analysis was required to explore its potential application in medicine.","Panikar, Sukanya; Shoba, Gunasekaran; Arun, Muthukrishnan; Sahayarayan, Jesudass Joseph; Usha Raja Nanthini, A; Chinnathambi, Arunachalam; Alharbi, Sulaiman A; Nasif, Omaima; Kim, Hak-Jae",J Infect Public Health,579,5

The objective of this article is to share our operational protocols to deliver an appropriate hospital trauma care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We changed our work shifts, in consideration of the high number of patients; colleagues from smaller hospitals in the area joined us to increase the number of surgeons available. Thanks to the collaboration between orthopaedists, anaesthesiologists, and nurses, we created a flow chart and separate routes (in the emergency room, in the wards, and in the operating rooms) to optimize patient management. Our protocols allow us to always provide healthcare professionals with the correct personal protective equipment for the task they are performing. RESULTS: Our strategies proved to be practical and feasible. Having a well thought plan helped us to provide for the most robust response possible. We have not yet been able to study the effectiveness of our protocols, and our recommendations may not be applicable to all healthcare facilities. Nonetheless, sharing our early experience can help other institutions conducting and adapting such plans more quickly.

In order to promptly inform and advise the population on nutrition optimization in the early days of anti-epidemic measures, an information reference Contact Center was created and is continuously functioning on the basis of the Federal Research Centre of Nutrition and Biotechnology. Equally important is the implementation of measures aimed at the prevention of food contamination with COVID-19 agent. In this regard, the Federal Research Centre of Nutrition and Biotechnology, together with Rospotrebnadzor prepared guidelines on measures to prevent the transmission of a new coronavirus infection through foods. Another aspect that the medical community has faced in connection with the pandemic is the need to reorient specialized medical organizations that have not previously worked with patients with infectious diseases in order to create Clinical centers for the treatment of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19. Thus, in the context of the spread of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19, many areas of medicine are involved in the process of providing anti-epidemic measures.

Focusing on Morlet wavelets, we propose to instead adapt the scales, orientations, and slants of the filters to produce problem-specific parametrizations of the scattering transform.

As such, the possibility of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood. We describe an investigation of two instances of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same individual. METHODS: A 25-year-old man who was a resident of Washoe County in the US state of Nevada presented to health authorities on two occasions with symptoms of viral infection, once at a community testing event in April, 2020, and a second time to primary care then hospital at the end of May and beginning of June, 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from the patient at each presentation and twice during follow-up. Nucleic acid amplification testing was done to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. We did next-generation sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs. Sequence data were assessed by two different bioinformatic methodologies. A short tandem repeat marker was used for fragment analysis to confirm that samples from both infections came from the same individual. FINDINGS: The patient had two positive tests for SARS-CoV-2, the first on April 18, 2020, and the second on June 5, 2020, separated by two negative tests done during follow-up in May, 2020. Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 showed genetically significant differences between each variant associated with each instance of infection. The second infection was symptomatically more severe than the first. INTERPRETATION: Genetic discordance of the two SARS-CoV-2 specimens was greater than could be accounted for by short-term in vivo evolution. These findings suggest that the patient was infected by SARS-CoV-2 on two separate occasions by a genetically distinct virus. Thus, previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 might not guarantee total immunity in all cases. All individuals, whether previously diagnosed with COVID-19 or not, should take identical precautions to avoid infection with SARS-CoV-2. The implications of reinfections could be relevant for vaccine development and application.

Using 15N-NH2Cl as an isotope tracer, we found that 15N-TCNM accounted for 70.7-76.5% of total TCNM during UV/NH2Cl treated 2 natural waters, which was significantly higher than the proportion of 15N-TCNM in chloramination (NH2Cl alone). This is a direct evidence that NH2Cl, rather than the nitrogenous matters in waters, was the predominant nitrogen source of TCNM during UV/NH2Cl treatment. Phenol derivatives with meta-substituents and with electron-withdrawing groups facilitated the formation of TCNM precursors during UV/NH2Cl treatment. Significant correlations were found between Hammett constants (&#963;) of substituents and TCNM formation potentials. The formation mechanisms of TCNM were revealed using resorcinol as a representative phenolic compound. During UV/NH2Cl treatment, HOâ¢, reactive chlorine species and reactive nitrogen species contributed to 28.1%, 29.0% and 19.4% of resorcinol degradation. Five nitro(so)-intermediates were identified as the main TCNM precursors. The formation pathways of TCNM were proposed. Alkaline pH was recommended to reduce the formation of TCNM precursors during UV/NH2Cl treatment.","Zhang, Xinran; Zhai, Jiaxin; Lei, Yu; Huang, Huang; Ren, Pengfei; Lambropoulou, Dimitra; Yang, Xin",J Hazard Mater,579,1

Based on our results, and in combination with the literature findings, we can conclude that the serological SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurement is a helpful tool in the fight against COVID-19. The assays can provide information about the patient's previous contact with the virus. Anti-spike protein assays correlate well with the virus neutralization test and can be used in the screening of potential convalescent plasma donors.","Simánek, Václav; Pecen, Ladislav; Krátká, Zuzana; Fürst, Tomás; Rezácková, Hana; Topolcan, Ondrej; Fajfrlík, Karel; Sedlácek, Dalibor; Sín, Robin; Pazdiora, Petr; Zelená, Hana; Slouka, David; Kucera, Radek",Diagnostics (Basel),579,25

The energy sector is of no exception, with several concerns being raised about the ramifications that will arise for the clean energy transition. The goal of our study is to review how governments in Africa have responded to this challenge in the energy sector. We used an internet search to gather information from government policy statements/briefs, and websites of international organizations such as the IMF, WHO, KPMG, and the World Bank. Our review revealed that the majority of preliminary responses were short-term and include the provision of free electricity, waiver/suspension of bill payments, and VAT exemptions on electricity bills. These measures were more pronounced in sub-Sahara Africa while oil-rich countries of the North mostly have broad economic measures that target their oil and gas sectors. Economic stimulus packages prepared by most countries do not explicitly mention energy sector companies/institutions, especially the Renewable Energies (RE) sector. Only three countries (Nigeria, Kenya, and Burkina Faso) had specific interventions for renewables. Overall, interventions were mostly fiscal/financial and short-term, with medium to long term measures often broad without being specific to the energy sector. As governments take measures to bolster their economies, they must pay particular attention to the challenges posed by the pandemic in the energy sector and capitalize on the opportunities that it presents to drive the clean energy transition.","Akrofi, Mark McCarthy; Antwi, Sarpong Hammond",Energy Res.

Given the critical importance of blood donation and transfusion we analyzed 92 blood samples of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 stratified by symptoms. Study Design and Methods: We therefore tested blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR targeting the E gene. In addition, we tested each blood sample for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies via ELISA and performed plaque reduction neutralization tests. Results: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was absent in the blood of mild to asymptomatic patients (57 individuals) and only detectable in individuals with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit (35 individuals) (n = 6/92 [6.5%];p = 0.023 Fisher’s exact test). Interestingly, anti-spike IgG antibodies were not significantly higher in intensive care unit patients compared to mild patients, but we found that their neutralizing capacity was disproportionately increased (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Our observations support the hypothesis that there are no potential hazards from blood or plasma transfusion of SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals with mild flu-like symptoms and more importantly of asymptomatic individuals.

METHODS: We matched lab-confirmed COVID-19 case and death data reported to the NYC Health Department as of June 2, 2020, against the NYC HIV surveillance registry. We describe and compare the characteristics and COVID-19-related outcomes of PWH diagnosed with COVID-19 with all NYC PWH and with all New Yorkers diagnosed with COVID-19. RESULTS: Through June 2, 204,583 NYC COVID-19 cases were reported. The registry match identified 2,410 PWH with diagnosed COVID-19 eligible for analysis (1.06% of all COVID-19 cases). Compared with all NYC PWH and all New Yorkers diagnosed with COVID-19, a higher proportion of PWH with COVID-19 were older, male, Black or Latino, and living in high-poverty neighborhoods. At least one underlying condition was reported for 58.9% of PWH with COVID-19. Compared with all NYC COVID-19 cases, a higher proportion of PWH with COVID-19 experienced hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and/or death; most PWH who experienced poor COVID-19-related outcomes had CD4 <500 cells/µL. CONCLUSIONS: Given NYC HIV prevalence is 1.5%, PWH were not overrepresented among COVID-19 cases. However, compared with NYC COVID-19 cases overall, a greater proportion of PWH had adverse COVID-19-related outcomes, perhaps because of a higher prevalence of factors associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. Given the pandemic's exacerbating effects on health inequities, HIV public health and clinical communities must strengthen services and support for people living with and affected by HIV.","Braunstein, Sarah L; Lazar, Rachael; Wahnich, Amanda; Daskalakis, Demetre C; Blackstock, Oni J",Clin Infect Dis,579,0

The new coronavirus responsible for this outbreak-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a bat coronavirus, RaTG132. Although bats may be the reservoir host for a variety of coronaviruses3,4, it remains unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 has additional host species. Here we show that a coronavirus, which we name pangolin-CoV, isolated from a Malayan pangolin has 100%, 98.6%, 97.8% and 90.7% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV-2 in the E, M, N and S proteins, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of pangolin-CoV is almost identical to that of SARS-CoV-2, with one difference in a noncritical amino acid. Our comparative genomic analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in the recombination of a virus similar to pangolin-CoV with one similar to RaTG13. Pangolin-CoV was detected in 17 out of the 25 Malayan pangolins that we analysed. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histological changes, and circulating antibodies against pangolin-CoV reacted with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The isolation of a coronavirus from pangolins that is closely related to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that these animals have the potential to act as an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2. This newly identified coronavirus from pangolins-the most-trafficked mammal in the illegal wildlife trade-could represent a future threat to public health if wildlife trade is not effectively controlled.","Xiao, Kangpeng; Zhai, Junqiong; Feng, Yaoyu; Zhou, Niu; Zhang, Xu; Zou, Jie-Jian; Li, Na; Guo, Yaqiong; Li, Xiaobing; Shen, Xuejuan; Zhang, Zhipeng; Shu, Fanfan; Huang, Wanyi; Li, Yu; Zhang, Ziding; Chen, Rui-Ai; Wu, Ya-Jiang; Peng, Shi-Ming; Huang, Mian; Xie, Wei-Jun; Cai, Qin-Hui; Hou, Fang-Hui; Chen, Wu; Xiao, Lihua; Shen, Yongyi",Nature,579,16

We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases. METHODS: We collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation. FINDINGS: Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9-19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9-28·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70â117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56-3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23-1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27-0·38] in those aged <60 years vs 6·4% [5·7-7·2] in those aged &#8805;60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2-15·9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4-3·5] in those aged <60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8-11·1] in those aged &#8805;60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39-1·33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0-37·6) in those aged 80 years or older. INTERPRETATION: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.

Telehealth benefits include improving access, decreasing costs, and elevating patient's experience. A review of cost minimization (CM) analyses was performed in order to explore scientific studies associated with integrating tele-otolaryngology in clinical practice. Our primary objective was to evaluate published literature for cost related to the implementation of telemedicine across otolaryngology, and to determine CM when compared to in-person visits. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic Literature Review. METHODS: We performed a systematic review using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane in May 2020, to identify studies with a cost analysis of tele-otolaryngology care. Inclusion criteria focused on articles citing CM data from telehealth services. Literature quality was assessed using the MINORS scoring system. RESULTS: From 380 original articles screened only nine evaluated cost in otolaryngology. CM in the US ranged from $68 to $900 per visit. Cost was evaluated in general otolaryngology, sleep medicine, otology, and head and neck cancer surgery, the latter had the most benefit. The most common types of telehealth visits were routine follow-up and screening. Data were insufficient for meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine has been trialed across various otolaryngology subspecialties; its incorporation is projected to have a meaningful impact on access to specialty care. This research suggests that the delivery of virtual care reduces cost with the potential of increasing net revenue across multiple otolaryngology subspecialties. Further studies are needed to better discern the entirety of cost savings and the best settings for integration.

METHODS: The Arizona Department of Health Services convened and facilitated 4 meetings during 4 months with a workgroup comprising the deans and curriculum representatives of all 18 medical, osteopathic, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, dental, podiatry, and naturopathic programs in Arizona. During this collaborative and iterative process, the workgroup reviewed existing curricula, established a philosophical framework, and developed a flexible and practical structure for a curriculum that would suit the needs of all program types. RESULTS: The Arizona Pain and Addiction Curriculum was finalized in June 2018. The curriculum aims to redefine pain and addiction as multidimensional public health issues and is structured as 10 core components, each supported by a detailed set of evidence-based objectives. The curriculum includes a set of annual metrics to collect from both programs (focused on implementation progress and barriers) and learners (focused on knowledge, attitudes, and practice plans). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first example of a statewide collaboration among diverse health professional education programs to create a single, standard curriculum. This collaborative process and the nonproprietary Arizona Pain and Addiction Curriculum may serve as a useful template for other states to enhance pain and addiction education.","Villarroel, Lisa; Mardian, Aram S; Christ, Cara; Rehman, Shakaib",Public Health Rep,579,33

Methods and Results We reviewed data on previously healthy pediatric patients (&#8804;18 years) with structurally normal hearts who presented at hospitals in the United States, United Kingdom, Spain and Pakistan with MIS-C and had consultation with a pediatric cardiologist. Data collected included demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory values, electrocardiographic abnormalities, echocardiographic findings and initial therapies. A total of 55 patients presented with MIS-C. Thirty-five patients (64%) had evidence of decreased left ventricular function, 17 (31%) had valvulitis, 12 (22%) with pericardial effusion and 11 (20%) with coronary abnormalities. Twenty-seven (49%) required ICU admission and 24 (44%) had evidence of shock. Eleven patients (20%) fulfilled complete Kawasaki disease criteria and had lower NT pro-BNP, D-dimer and ferritin levels compared with those who did not fulfill criteria. Electrophysiologic abnormalities occurred in 6 patients and included complete atrioventricular (AV) block, transient AV block and ventricular tachycardia.

The top barriers for medication adherence were non availability of medication (54.81%), financial difficulties (30.29%), did not feel much improvement with eye drops (20.19%). On multiple regression analysis, longer distance to hospital, low socioeconomic status, more than one antiglaucoma medication use, lack of awareness of glaucoma, non-complaint before COVID-19 and stress due to the pandemic were found to be significant factors for medication non adherence. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for reformation in health care system for accessibility of medical care to patients in rural areas. Decentralization of health system to primary care level and utilization of teleophthalmology should be considered by health care planners in future.","Subathra, G N; Rajendrababu, Sharmila R; Senthilkumar, Vijayalakshmi A; Mani, Iswarya; Udayakumar, B",Indian J Ophthalmol,579,16

We conducted a descriptive analysis using public health data to describe age- and sex-specific acute care use, length of stay (LOS) and mortality associated with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive analysis using Ontario's Case and Contact Management Plus database of individuals who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Ontario from Mar. 1 to Sept. 30, 2020, to determine age- and sex-specific hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, use of invasive mechanical ventilation, LOS and mortality. We stratified analyses by month of infection to study temporal trends and conducted subgroup analyses by long-term care residency. RESULTS: During the observation period, 56 476 individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were reported; 41 049 (72.7%) of these were younger than 60 years, and 29 196 (51.7%) were female. Proportion of cases shifted from older populations (> 60 yr) to younger populations (10-39 yr) over time. Overall, 5383 (9.5%) of individuals were admitted to hospital; of these, 1183 (22.0%) were admitted to the ICU, and 712 (60.2%) of these received invasive mechanical ventilation. Mean LOS for individuals in the ward, ICU without invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU with invasive mechanical ventilation was 12.8 (standard deviation [SD] 15.4), 8.5 (SD 7.8) and 20.5 (SD 18.1) days, respectively. Among patients receiving care in the ward, ICU without invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU with invasive mechanical ventilation, 911/3834 (23.8%), 124/418 (29.7%) and 287/635 (45.2%) died, respectively. All outcomes varied by age and decreased over time, overall and within age groups. INTERPRETATION: This descriptive study shows use of acute care and mortality varying by age and decreasing between March and September 2020 in Ontario. Improvements in clinical practice and changing risk distributions among those infected may contribute to fewer severe outcomes.","Mac, Stephen; Barrett, Kali; Khan, Yasin A; Naimark, David M J; Rosella, Laura; Ximenes, Raphael; Sander, Beate",CMAJ Open,579,1

METHODS: We searched Embase, Medline, bioRxiv, and medRxiv up to 22 June 2020. We included cohorts or cross-sectional studies which systematically tested populations regardless of symptoms for COVID-19, or case series of any size reporting contact investigations of asymptomatic index patients. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed quality using pre-specified criteria. Only moderate/high quality studies were included. The main outcomes were proportion of asymptomatic infection among COVID-19 positive persons at testing and through follow-up, and secondary attack rate among close contacts of asymptomatic index patients. A qualitative synthesis was performed. Where appropriate, data were pooled using random effects meta-analysis to estimate proportions and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Of 6,137 identified studies, 71 underwent quality assessment after full text review, and 28 were high/moderate quality and were included. In two general population studies, the proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection at time of testing was 20% and 75%, respectively; among three studies in contacts it was 8.2% to 50%. In meta-analysis, the proportion (95% CI) of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in obstetric patients was 95% (45% to 100%) of which 59% (49% to 68%) remained asymptomatic through follow-up; among nursing home residents, the proportion was 54% (42% to 65%) of which 28% (13% to 50%) remained asymptomatic through follow-up. Transmission studies were too heterogenous to meta-analyse. Among five transmission studies, 18 of 96 (18.8%) close contacts exposed to asymptomatic index patients were COVID-19 positive. CONCLUSIONS: Despite study heterogeneity, the proportion of asymptomatic infection among COVID-19 positive persons appears high and transmission potential seems substantial. To further our understanding, high quality studies in representative general population samples are required.","Yanes-Lane, Mercedes; Winters, Nicholas; Fregonese, Federica; Bastos, Mayara; Perlman-Arrow, Sara; Campbell, Jonathon R; Menzies, Dick",PLoS One,579,21

Soon after the emergence of COVID-19, medical practitioners used X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images of patients' lungs to detect COVID-19. Machine learning methods are capable of improving the identification accuracy of COVID-19 in X-ray and CT images, delivering near real-time results, while alleviating the burden on medical practitioners. In this work, we demonstrate the efficacy of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, trained with a combination of deep convolutional and handcrafted features extracted from X-ray chest scans. We use this combination of features to discriminate between healthy, common pneumonia, and COVID-19 patients. The performance of the combined feature approach is compared with a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) and the SVM trained with handcrafted features. We find that combining the features in our novel framework improves the performance of the classification task compared to the independent application of convolutional and handcrafted features. Specifically, we achieve an accuracy of 0.988 in the classification task with our combined approach compared to 0.963 and 0.983 accuracy for the handcrafted features with SVM and CNN respectively.","Zhang, Weihan; Pogorelsky, Bryan; Loveland, Mark; Wolf, Trevor",,579,10

This paper aims to examine how the design of a residential course was adapted to an online context and how this adaptation may prove beneficial to future iterations of the course. Design/methodology/approach: This analysis centers on a master’s-level course in which students design software to support learning. One of the major changes to the course revolves around the transition from a traditional rubric-based grading scheme to a specifications grading system. This latter approach provides a series of binary (pass/fail) requirements (specifications) that students must meet to pass. Various forms of interactions were also altered during the transition; the authors investigate these in the paper. Findings: This study found that the move to specifications grading helped students and the instructor to focus on the important work of meeting course learning goals. The approach also aligned well with authentic scenarios in which software projects are tested against certain specifications. Finally, this study concludes that thinking about specifications grading in the future can help us to develop more resilient pedagogical design approaches that respond to various forms of disruptions and changes. Originality/value: The course design insights described in this paper illustrate alternative ways of instruction that can be especially useful during times of emergency, but which may also provide an added level of authenticity and learner motivation during times of stability.","Quintana, Rebecca; Quintana, Chris",inform.Learn.Sci,579,27

It is documented that health-seeking behaviors change during pandemics. The objective of this study was to examine social determinants associated with decisions to seek dental care in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 4372 participants were invited to this cross-sectional web-based survey distributed from April 21 to June 20, 2020. The survey included a list of emergency, urgent, and routine dental procedures. Participants were asked if they would seek dental care for these conditions during the pandemic, and what pain severity would make them seek dental treatment. Logistic regression models were performed for predicting variables that explain the decision to go or not to go to the dental clinic during the pandemic for each dental condition. RESULTS: A total of 3443 responded to this survey. The emergency dental situation participants were most willing to go to the dental clinic for was trauma involving facial bones compromising the airway (94.5%). Only 65.8% were willing to seek care for facial cellulitis compromising the airway. On average 35.2% reported seeking teleconsultation as the first step. Eighteen percent of participants were still willing to go to the dental clinic during the pandemic for routine dental procedures. Multiple logistic regression showed that females (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.6, OR 95% CI 1.3, 1.9), people who had never visited a dentist (OR: 1.8, OR 95% CI 1.3, 2.5), and people living in metropolitan regions (OR: 1.8, OR 95%: 1.4, 2.3) had higher odds for not seeking emergency dental care during this pandemic. The pain threshold for seeking dental care during the pandemic was 7 out of 10. Female, those who never visited a dentist, and those from urban regions reported higher pain threshold before seeking dental care (P value < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Social disparities were found in emergency dental care seeking decision-making in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was alarming that some people were afraid to seek dental care for life-threatening dental emergencies as cellulitis during this pandemic. This reflects the importance of increasing public health awareness and governmental regulations.","Meisha, Dalia E; Alsolami, Ahad Mosallem; Alharbi, Ghaliah Muslih",BMC Oral Health,579,20

Over the last few years, numerous mobile apps have been developed to challenge the brain with cognitive exercises; however, little is currently known about how age influences capacity for performance improvement when playing cognitive mobile games. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the score data of cognitive mobile games over a period of 100 gaming sessions to determine age-related learning ability for new cognitive tasks by measuring the level of score improvement achieved by participants of different ages. METHODS: Scores from 9000 individuals of different ages for 7 cognitive mobile games over 100 gaming sessions were analyzed. Scores from the first session were compared between age groups using one-way analysis of variance. Mixed models were subsequently used to investigate the progression of scores over 100 sessions. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found between age groups for the initial scores of 6 of the 7 games (linear trend, P<.001). Cognitive mobile game scores increased for all participants (P<.001) suggesting that all participants were able to improve their performance. The rate of improvement was, however, strongly influenced by the age of the participant with slower progression for older participants (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence to support two interesting insights-cognitive mobile game scores appear to be sensitive to the changes in cognitive ability that occur with advancing age; therefore, these games could be a convenient way to monitor cognitive function over long-term follow-up, and users who train with the cognitive mobile games improve regardless of age.","Bonnechère, Bruno; Bier, Jean-Christophe; Van Hove, Olivier; Sheldon, Sally; Samadoulougou, Sékou; Kirakoya-Samadoulougou, Fati; Klass, Malgorzata",JMIR Serious Games,579,27

The gold standard for diagnosis relies heavily on clinical suspicion along with PCR based assays of respiratory swabs. This nucleic acid study is highly sensitive and specific, however, there are faults, especially during the incubation period, during which the virus is hard to detect. Here we present a case of a patient, presenting with signs and symptoms of pneumonia, with serial negative viral swabs spaced out over time, who was ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19 infection via more invasive means. Case: A 49-year-old female with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with cough and shortness of breath for 2 days which developed when she returned to New York from Florida. Her personal history was significant for her occupation as an ER nurse and a history of vaping for 5-6 years.After arrival to the emergency department, the patient was febrile to 103.3 F, tachycardic, and hypoxic, saturating 89% on room air. Her laboratory work was significant for a mildly elevated D-dimer level, elevated CRP (11.23), normal procalcitonin level, and two negative COVID-19 swabs over 2 days. Her initial chest X ray showed multifocal pneumonia and a CT chest showed ground glass opacities amid dense consolidation. The patient was empirically treated for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia with antibiotics. The patient's respiratory and hemodynamic status started to decline, despite treatment. Ultimately, the patient required further investigation - a bronchoalveolar lavage was ultimately found to be positive for the COVID-19 virus, and the patient was immediately started on Remdesivir. Discussion: In this day and age, countries are increasingly utilizing the COVID-19 reverse-transcriptase PCR and are pushing for widespread testing for case detection, but how sensitive and specific is this test, really? Serial testing with swabs performed at intervals should be the answer as the viral load of the COVID RNA steadily rises and peaks over 0-9 days after onset of symptoms. However, this may not be the case in a majority of patients and more invasive testing using bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage may be the only way to truly diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia. The delay in confirmation, however, could prove to be truly fatal, subjecting patients to painful measures like intubation. This case brings to light the realization that nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs may not be sufficient to detect the virus with full certainty.","Menon, A.; Bachan, M.; Khan, Z.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,579,21

To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of ensuring healthy lives and well-being for all ages, particularly for newborns and children under the age of 5 (goal 3b), it is essential to generate and use quality data for evidence-based decision making to overcome barriers inherent in immunization systems. In Pakistan, only 66 % of children receive all basic vaccinations, and in Sindh province, the number is even lower at 49 %. In 2012, IRD developed and piloted Zindagi Mehfooz (Safe Life; ZM) ElR, an Android-based platform that records and analyses individual-level child data in real-time. In 2017 in collaboration with Expanded Programme for Immunization (EPI) Sindh, ZM was scaled-up across the entire Sindh province and is currently being used by 2521 government vaccinators in 1539 basic health facilities, serving >48 million population. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to demonstrate how big immunization data from the ZM-EIR is being leveraged in Sindh, Pakistan for actionable decision making via three use cases (a) improving performance management of vaccinators to increase geographical coverage, (b) quantifying the impact of provincial accelerated outreach activities, and (c) examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine immunization coverage to help devise a tailored approach for future efforts. METHODS: From October 2017 to April 2020, more than 2.9 million children and 0.9 million women have been enrolled, and more than 22 million immunization events have been recorded in the ZM-EIR. We extracted de-identified data from ZM-EIR for January 1, 2019 - April 20, 2020, period. Given the needs of each use case, monthly and daily indicators on vaccinator performance (attendance and compliance), daily immunization visits, and the number of antigens administered were calculated. Geo-coordinate data of antigen administration was extracted and displayed on geographic maps using QGIS. All generated reports were shared at fixed frequency with various stakeholders, such as partners at EPI-Sindh, for utilization in decision making and informing policy. RESULT: Our use-cases demonstrate the use of EIR data for data-driven decision making. From January - December 2019, the monthly monitoring of program indicators helped increase the vaccinator attendance from 44% to 88%, while an 85 % increase in geographical coverage was observed in a polio-endemic super high-risk union council (SHRUC) in Karachi. The analysis of daily average antigens administered during accelerated outreach efforts (AOE) as compared to routine activities showed an increase in average daily Pentavalent-3, Measles-1, and Measles-2 vaccines administered by 103%, 154%, and 180% respectively. These findings helped decide to continue the accelerated effort in high-risk areas (compared to the entire province) rather than discontinuing the activity due to high costs. During COVID-19 lockdown, the daily average number of child immunizations reduced from 16,649 to 4335 per day, a decline of 74% compared to 6 months preceding COVID-19 lockdown. ZM-EIR data is currently helping to shape the planning and implementation of critical strategies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The big data for vaccines generated through EIRs is a powerful tool to monitor immunization work-force and ensure chronically missed communities are identified and covered through targeted strategies. Geospatial data availability and analysis is changing the way EPI review meetings occur with stakeholders, taking data-driven decisions for better planning and resource allocation. In the fight against COVID-19 pandemic, as governments gradually begin to shift from containing the outbreak to strategizing a plan for sustaining the essential health services, the countries that will emerge most successful are likely the ones who can best use technology and real-time data for targeted efforts.","Siddiqi, Danya Arif; Abdullah, Sara; Dharma, Vijay Kumar; Shah, Mubarak Taighoon; Akhter, Mohammed Adil; Habib, Ali; Khan, Aamir Javed; Chandir, Subhash",Int J Med Inform,579,33

The present study examined the development and evaluation of care pathways to manage nutritional care of patients following COVID-19 infection prior to and after discharge. METHODS: Registered UK dietitians completed an online questionnaire comprising 26 questions about the development of a pathway, its use, evaluation and training needs. RESULTS: Of 57 responses from organisations, 37 (65%) were involved in the planning/management of nutritional care. Only 19 responses had a new or adapted COVID-19 pathway. Of these, 74% reported involvement of dietetic services, 47% reported > 1 eligibility criteria for pathway inclusion and 53% accepted all positive or suspected cases. All respondents used nutritional screening, first-line dietary advice (food first) and referral for further advice and monitoring. Weight and food intake were the most used outcome measure. All pathways addressed symptoms related to nutrition, with the most common being weight loss with poor appetite, not being hungry and skipping meals in 84% of pathways. Over half of respondents (54%) planned to evaluate their pathway and 83% reported that they were 'very or reasonably confident' in their team's nutritional management of COVID-19. Less than half (42%) reported on training needs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite challenges encountered, pathways were developed and implemented. Dietitians had adapted to new ways of working to manage nutritional care in patients prior to and after discharge from hospital following COVID-19 infection.

Further training is essential to improve some aspects in this field. Social media has proven to be the optimal source of information for medical students, which is incompatible with their future careers as doctors. The pandemic had a negative impact on medical students, expressed as fear regarding the virus spread; nevertheless, many have felt the need to assist healthcare systems under appropriate precautions.","Magklara, Elli; Angelis, Stavros; Solia, Eirini; Katsimantas, Antonios; Kourlaba, Georgia; Kostakis, Georgios; Tsakotos, Georgios; Zaoutis, Theoklis; Filippou, Dimitrios",Acta Biomed,579,24

METHODS: A total of 122 subjects with COVID-19 were included: 106 SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients and 16 RT-PCR-negative patients with symptoms and chest computed tomography (CT) consistent with COVID-19. Ninety-six historical blood donation samples were used as controls. Demographic and clinical characteristics were retrieved from electronic records. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated, as were their 95% binomial confidence intervals using the Clopper-Pearson method. All analyses were performed in R version 3.6.3. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the chromatographic immunoassay in all RT-PCR-positive patients, irrespective of the timing of symptom onset, was 85.8% (95% binomial CI 77.7% to 91.9%). This increased with time after symptom onset, and at >14 days was 94.9% (85.9% to 98.9%). The specificity was 100% (96.4% to 100%). 15/16 (94%) RT- PCR-negative cases tested positive. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes mellitus and the most frequent symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea. All RT-PCR-negative patients had pneumonia. The most frequent thoracic CT findings were ground glass changes (nâ¯=â¯11, 68%), which were bilateral in 9 (56%) patients, and diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates (nâ¯=â¯5, 31%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 rapid chromatographic immunoassay evaluated in this study had a high sensitivity and specificity using plasma, particularly after 14 days from symptom onset. ELISA and qualitative rapid chromatographic immunoassays can be used for the diagnosis of RT-PCR-negative patients.","Costa, Silvia Figueiredo; Buss, Lewis; Espinoza, Evelyn Patrícia Sanchez; Vieira, Jose Mauro; de Oliveira da Silva, Lea Campos; de Souza, Regina Maia; Neto, Lauro Perdigão; Porto, Ana Paula Matos; Lazari, Carolina; Dos Santos, Vera Aparecida; da Silva Duarte, Alberto; Nastri, Ana Catharina; da Costa Leite, Gabriel Fialkovitz; Manuli, Erika; de Oliveira, Maura Salaroli; Zampelli, Daniella Bosco; Pastore, Laerte; Segurado, Aluísio Cotrim; Levin, Anna S; Sabino, Ester",J Clin Virol,579,21

We examined the associations between the proportion of Black residents in NHs and COVID-19 infections and deaths, accounting for structural bias (operationalized as county-level factors) and stratifying by urbanicity/rurality. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional observational cohort study using publicly available data from the LTCfocus, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Long-Term Care Facility COVID-19 Module, and the NYTimes county-level COVID-19 database. Four multivariable linear regression models omitting and including facility characteristics, COVID-19 burden, and county-level fixed effects were estimated. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In total, 11,587 US NHs that reported data on COVID-19 to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and had data in LTCfocus and NYTimes from January 20, 2020 through July 19, 2020. MEASURES: Proportion of Black residents in NHs (exposure); COVID-19 infections and deaths (main outcomes). RESULTS: The proportion of Black residents in NHs were as follows: none= 3639 (31.4%), <20% = 1020 (8.8%), 20%-49.9% = 1586 (13.7%), &#8805;50% = 681 (5.9%), not reported = 4661 (40.2%). NHs with any Black residents showed significantly more COVID-19 infections and deaths than NHs with no Black residents. There were 13.6 percentage points more infections and 3.5 percentage points more deaths in NHs with &#8805;50% Black residents than in NHs with no Black residents (P < .001). Although facility characteristics explained some of the differences found in multivariable analyses, county-level factors and rurality explained more of the differences. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: It is likely that attributes of place, such as resources, services, and providers, important to equitable care and health outcomes are not readily available to counties where NHs have greater proportions of Black residents. Structural bias may underlie these inequities. It is imperative that support be provided to NHs that serve greater proportions of Black residents while considering the rurality of the NH setting.","Travers, Jasmine L; Agarwal, Mansi; Estrada, Leah V; Dick, Andrew W; Gracner, Tadeja; Wu, Bei; Stone, Patricia W",J Am Med Dir Assoc,579,25

Here, we present the implementation of a practical MCMC method in the open-source software package PyBioNetFit (PyBNF), which is designed to support parameterization of mathematical models for biological systems. The new MCMC method, am, incorporates an adaptive move proposal distribution. For warm starts, sampling can be initiated at a specified location in parameter space and with a multivariate Gaussian proposal distribution defined initially by a specified covariance matrix. Multiple chains can be generated in parallel using a computer cluster. We demonstrate that am can be used to successfully solve real-world Bayesian inference problems, including forecasting of new Coronavirus Disease 2019 case detection with Bayesian quantification of forecast uncertainty. PyBNF version 1.1.9, the first stable release with am, is available at PyPI and can be installed using the pip package-management system on platforms that have a working installation of Python 3.

Pain is a commonly studied symptom in pancreatic cancer; however, few studies examine the frequency of multiple patient-reported symptoms. Our aim is to ascertain patient-reported symptom burden at initial consultation with a palliative care provider and compare patient prognostic awareness to provider estimation of prognosis. METHODS: Data were extracted from the standardized Quality Data Collection Tool (QDACT). Adults with pancreatic cancer seen by a palliative care provider were included. Descriptive statistics were used to describe demographic features, symptom prevalence and burden, as well as assess patient prognosis awareness defined by congruence or incongruence with provider estimated prognosis. RESULTS: 285 patients were included in our analysis. The average age was 68 years (SD: 12.4), 87.2% were white, 50% male. The mean number of moderate/severe symptoms was 2.6 (SD: 2) out of 9 symptoms. Tiredness (66.7%), appetite (64.5%) and pain (46.2%) had the highest rates of moderate/severe symptom burden. Patients with a prognosis of 1-6 months had the lowest proportion of congruence with provider estimation (56.5%). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests targets to improve patient-centered care of pancreatic cancer. Patients commonly have multiple symptoms that are moderate/severe at time of palliative care referral. While pain has been well-reported, tiredness and decreased appetite are more prevalent at initial visit. This emphasizes the importance of assessing multiple symptoms and working closely with palliative care for early referral. Overall, one third of patient prognosis estimates differed from the provider assessment of prognosis. Our data support the importance of early referral to palliative care to manage symptoms and better prepare patients for end-of-life care.","Johnson, Alyson M; Wolf, Steven; Xuan, Mengdi; Samsa, Greg; Kamal, Arif; Fisher, Deborah A",J Palliat Care,579,23

Fortunately, most children display only mild-to-moderate symptoms, but there are a subset that will have severe symptoms warranting treatment. This review evaluates the current evidence for antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment of acute SARS-COV-2 infections, including coronavirus disease 2019 in pediatrics. RECENT FINDINGS: Treatment recommendations continue to evolve with emerging results from clinical trials. Initial therapies were tailored to repurposed medications, and have now transitioned toward more specific antiviral therapy. In addition to specific antiviral therapy, there is also support to modulate the immune system and reduce inflammatory damage seen in coronavirus disease 2019. Much of the data result from adult studies with subsequent extrapolation to pediatrics. SUMMARY: Recommended therapy will continue to adapt as results return from clinical trials. A continued commitment from the National Institutes of Health and research community to assist in determining optimal therapies for pediatric patients is essential. Until then, most recommendations will likely be informed from the results seen in adult populations.","Murphy, Mark E; Clay, Gwendolyn; Danziger-Isakov, Lara; Schulert, Grant; Paulsen, Grant C",Curr Opin Pediatr,579,1

Moreover, other out-ofhospital spaces have been transformed into hospitalization units to absorb the large number of patients that had to be treated and isolated. To guarantee the distribution of medicines and the quality of the pharmaceutical care, drug distribution systems, such as unit dose and automated dispensing systems, have undergone transformations. Standard stocks were assigned for COVID units, and different dispensing circuits to avoid the risk of cross-contamination between COVID and non-COVID units were created, as well as disinfection protocols for medication transport systems and medication return protocols. All this without forgetting COVID treatment protocol's changes that were affected by the availability of the drugs. The increase in the number of beds in out-of-hospital spaces, such as field hospitals, hotels, socio-medical centers and nursing homes, has challenged Pharmacy Services, since new medication dispensing and conciliation circuits have been created forcing the increase of pharmacy staff's presence and modifying work shifts, to afford all the new tasks successfully.

MAIN: SARS-CoV-2 stimulates humoral and cellular immunity systems, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear NF-kB signalling pathways, which regulate inflammatory gene expression and immune cell differentiation. The result is pro-inflammatory cytokines release, hyperinflammatory condition, and cytokine storm, which provoke severe lung alterations that can lead to multi-organ failure in COVID-19. Multiple genetic and immunologic factors may contribute to the severity of COVID-19 in African individuals when compared to the rest of the global population. In this article, the role of malaria, NF-kB and MAPK pathways, caspase-12 expression, high level of LAIR-1-containing antibodies, and differential glycophorins (GYPA/B) expression in COVID-19 are discussed. CONCLUSION: Understanding pathophysiological mechanisms can help identify target points for drugs and vaccines development against COVID-19.

In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, several behavioural change and policy initiatives, such as physical distancing, have been implemented to control the spread of the coronavirus. Social media data can reveal public perceptions toward how governments and health agencies across the globe are handling the pandemic, as well as the impact of the disease on people regardless of their geographic locations in line with various factors that hinder or facilitate the efforts to control the spread of the pandemic globally. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people globally using social media data. METHODS: We apply natural language processing (NLP) and thematic analysis to understand public opinions, experiences, and issues with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic using social media data. First, we collect over 47 million COVID-19-related comments from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and three online discussion forums. Second, we perform data preprocessing which involves applying NLP techniques to clean and prepare the data for automated keyphrase extraction. Third, we apply NLP approach to extract meaningful keyphrases from over 1 million randomly-selected comments, as well as compute sentiment scores for each keyphrase and assign sentiment polarity (i.e., positive, negative, or neutral) based on the scores using lexicon-based technique. Fourth, we grouped related negative and positive keyphrases into categories or broad themes. RESULTS: A total of 34 negative themes emerged, out of which 15 are health-related issues, psychosocial issues, and social issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic from the public perspective. Some of the health-related issues are increased mortality, health concerns, struggling health systems, and fitness issues; while some of the psychosocial issues include frustrations due to life disruptions, panic shopping, and expression of fear. Social issues include harassment, domestic violence, and wrong societal attitude. In addition, 20 positive themes emerged from our results. Some of the positive themes include public awareness, encouragement, gratitude, cleaner environment, online learning, charity, spiritual support, and innovative research. CONCLUSIONS: We uncover various negative and positive themes representing public perceptions toward the COVID-19 pandemic and recommend interventions that can help address the health, psychosocial, and social issues based on the positive themes and other research evidence. These interventions will help governments, health professionals and agencies, institutions, and individuals in their efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 and minimize its impact, as well as in reacting to any future pandemics.","Oyebode, Oladapo; Ndulue, Chinenye; Adib, Ashfaq; Mulchandani, Dinesh; Suruliraj, Banuchitra; Orji, Fidelia Anulika; Chambers, Christine; Meier, Sandra; Orji, Rita",,579,6

Foram utilizados dados de inquérito telefônico entre participantes do ELSI-Brasil (Estudo Longitudinal da Saúde dos Idosos Brasileiros), conduzido entre maio e junho de 2020. Avaliou-se o uso de medidas de prevenção não farmacológica para COVID-19, motivos para sair de casa segundo a presença de multimorbidade e variáveis sociodemográficas. Participaram do estudo 6.149 pessoas. Multimorbidade foi mais frequente no sexo feminino, em casados, na faixa etária 50-59 anos de idade e em moradores da zona urbana. A maior parte da população saiu de casa entre uma e duas vezes na última semana, percentual que aumentou segundo o número de morbidades (22,3% sem morbidades e 38% com multimorbidade). Sair de casa todos os dias teve menor ocorrência entre indivíduos com multimorbidade (10,3%), e 9,3% saíram de casa na última semana para obter atendimento de saúde. Higienização de mãos (&gt; 98%) e sempre usar máscara ao sair de casa (&gt; 96%) foram hábitos quase universais. Observou-se maior adesão ao isolamento social entre as mulheres com multimorbidade quando comparadas com os homens (RP = 1,49; IC95%: 1,23-1,79); esta adesão aumentou proporcionalmente com a idade e inversamente ao nível de escolaridade. O comportamento de proteção em pessoas com multimorbidade parece ser maior em relação aos demais, embora questões relacionadas ao isolamento social e cuidado em saúde mereçam ser destacadas. Esses achados podem ser úteis na customização de estratégias de enfrentamento atual da pandemia.","Batista, Sandro Rodrigues; Souza, Ana Sara Semeão de; Nogueira, Januse; Andrade, Fabíola Bof de; Thumé, Elaine; Teixeira, Doralice Severo da Cruz; Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda; Facchini, Luiz Augusto; Nunes, Bruno Pereira",Cad.

MAS and associated cytokine storms have been observed in COVID-19 patients exhibiting systemic hyperinflammation. Interleukin-18 (IL-18), a proinflammatory cytokine belonging to the IL-1 family, is elevated in both MAS and COVID-19 patients, and its level is known to correlate with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. IL-18 binds its specific receptor IL-1 receptor 5 (IL-1R5, also known as IL-18 receptor alpha chain), leading to the recruitment of the coreceptor, IL-1 receptor 7 (IL-1R7, also known as IL-18 receptor beta chain). This heterotrimeric complex then initiates downstream signaling, resulting in systemic and local inflammation. Here, we developed a novel humanized monoclonal anti-IL-1R7 antibody to specifically block the activity of IL-18 and its inflammatory signaling. We characterized the function of this antibody in human cell lines, in freshly obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in human whole blood cultures. We found that the anti-IL-1R7 antibody significantly suppressed IL-18-mediated NF&#954;B activation, reduced IL-18-stimulated IFNÎ³ and IL-6 production in human cell lines, and reduced IL-18-induced IFNÎ³, IL-6, and TNF&#945; production in PBMCs. Moreover, the anti-IL-1R7 antibody significantly inhibited LPS- and Candida albicans-induced IFNÎ³ production in PBMCs, as well as LPS-induced IFNÎ³ production in whole blood cultures. Our data suggest that blocking IL-1R7 could represent a potential therapeutic strategy to specifically modulate IL-18 signaling and may warrant further investigation into its clinical potential for treating IL-18-mediated diseases, including MAS and COVID-19.","Li, Suzhao; Jiang, Liqiong; Beckmann, Karsten; Højen, Jesper Falkesgaard; Pessara, Ulrich; Powers, Nicholas E; de Graaf, Dennis M; Azam, Tania; Lindenberger, Jared; Eisenmesser, Elan Z; Fischer, Stephan; Dinarello, Charles A",J Biol Chem,579,1

The role of RPT in critically ill COVID-19 patients is poorly described. We aimed to investigate the effects of RPT on oxygenation and lung aeration in critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Methods: Observational pre-post study. Patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to the ICU, who received a protocolized CPT session and for which a pre-and post-RPT lung ultrasound (LUS) was performed, were included. A subgroup of patients had an available quantitative computed tomography (CT) scan performed within 4 days from RPT. The primary aim was to evaluate whether RPT improved oxygenation;secondary aims included correlations between LUS, CT and response to RPT. Results: Twenty patients were included. The median (1st–3rd quartile) PaO2/FiO2 was 181 (105–456), 244 (137–497) and 246 (137–482) at baseline (T0), after RPT (T1), and after 6 h (T2), respectively. PaO2/FiO2 improved throughout the study (p = 0.042);particularly, PaO2/FiO2 improved at T1 in respect to T0 (p = 0.011), remaining higher at T2 (p = 0.007) compared to T0. Correlations between LUS, volume of gas (rho = 0.58, 95%CI 0.05–0.85, p = 0.033) and hyper-aerated mass at CT scan (rho = 0.54, 95% CI 0.00–0.84, p = 0.045) were detected. No significant changes in LUS score were observed before and after RPT. Conclusions: RPT improved oxygenation and the improvement persisted after 6 h. Oxygenation improvement was not reflected by aeration changes assessed with LUS.

Most studies have investigated short-term responses of organisms to unrealistically high concentrations of pesticides; however, chronic exposure to persistent low concentrations, which are more likely to occur in the environment, are rarely analyzed. Here, we tested the response of polyps of the Moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita, to environmental concentrations of the herbicide atrazine and the insecticide chlorpyrifos, individually and in combination, over nine weeks. We hypothesized that exposure to individual pesticides would reduce rates of asexual reproduction and alter polyps' metabolite profiles, and that the results would be more severe when polyps were exposed to the combined pesticides. Polyps survived and reproduced (through budding) in all treatments and no differences among treatments were observed. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) spectroscopy revealed no difference in profiles of polar metabolites of polyps exposed to the individual or combined pesticides. Our results suggest that A. aurita polyps are unaffected by chronic exposure to atrazine and chlorpyrifos at concentrations recommended as being protective by current Australian water quality guidelines.

METHODS: A retrospective study conducted between February and June 2020 in Dubai, UAE, for all laboratory-confirmed Coronavirus disease-19 patients. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and clinical outcomes were compared between patients with and without acute cardiac injury. RESULTS: During the study period, 203 patients were included, of which, 44 (21.7%) had evidence of acute cardiac injury. Compared with patients without acute cardiac injury, patients with acute cardiac injury were: older, had more shortness of breath, diabetes, hypertension, and more bilateral airspace shadowing on admission chest radiography. These patients also had a higher neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimers and lactate dehydrogenase but lower lymphocyte count. Regarding outcomes, these patients had higher intensive care admissions; a higher rate of complications including acute kidney and liver injury, acidosis, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, needed more mechanical ventilation, and had a significantly higher risk of death. CONCLUSION: Acute cardiac injury is common among Coronavirus disease-19 patients. These patients present with higher comorbidities, have high inflammatory markers and have greater risk for in-hospital multi-organ damage, need for mechanical ventilation, and death.

FLW are in need of self-care programs to support their mental health. METHODS: Quasi-experimental study to assess the impact of a simple mental well-being and emotional regulation training, the Community Resiliency Model (CRM), using a convenience sample of FLW. Baseline scores of mental well-being and stress measures were compared with follow-up scores at 3 time points. Outcomes were psychological wellness (World Health Organization-5 Well-being Index); resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10); traumatic stress (Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale); physical symptoms (Somatic Symptom Scale-8). RESULTS: Of the 104 participants who enrolled and attended the CRM training, 73 (70.2%) completed at least 1 posttest. Well-being scores increased at 1 year with a small-moderate effect size (Cohen d=0.32). Resilience scores increased with a small-moderate effect size by 1 year (Cohen d=0.36).

However, analysis of immunity against SARS-COV-2 is currently lacking. METHODS: Here, we analyzed T cell immunity directed against SARS-CoV-2 spike-, membrane-, and nucleocapsid-protein by flow cytometry and spike-specific neutralizing antibodies in ten Tx in comparison to 26 nonimmunosuppressed (non-Tx) COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Tx-patients (seven renal, one lung, and two combined pancreas-kidney transplants) were recruited in this study during the acute phase of COVID-19 with a median time after SARS-CoV-2-positivity of 3 and 4 days for non-Tx- and Tx-patients, respectively. Despite immunosuppression, we detected antiviral CD4 T cell-response in 90% of Tx-patients. SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 T cells produced multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating their potential protective capacity. Neutralizing antibody-titers did not differ between groups. SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells targeting membrane- and spike-protein were lower in Tx-patients, albeit without statistical significance. However, frequencies of anti-nucleocapsid-protein-reactive, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyfunctional CD8 T cells, were similar between patient cohorts. Tx-patients showed features of a prematurely aged adaptive immune system, but equal frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-reactive memory T cells. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a polyfunctional T cell immunity directed against SARS-CoV-2-proteins as well as neutralizing antibodies can be generated in Tx-patients despite immunosuppression. In comparison to nonimmunosuppressed-patients, no differences in humoral and cellular antiviral-immunity were found. Our data presenting the ability to generate SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity in immunosuppressed patients has implications for the handling of SARS-CoV-2-infected Tx patients and raises hopes for effective vaccination in this cohort.Supplemental Visual Abstract; http://links.lww.com/TP/C186.","Thieme, Constantin J; Anft, Moritz; Paniskaki, Krystallenia; Blazquez-Navarro, Arturo; Doevelaar, Adrian; Seibert, Felix S; Hoelzer, Bodo; Konik, Margarethe Justine; Meister, Toni L; Pfaender, Stephanie; Steinmann, Eike; Berger, Marc Moritz; Brenner, Thorsten; Kölsch, Uwe; Dolff, Sebastian; Roch, Toralf; Witzke, Oliver; Schenker, Peter; Viebahn, Richard; Stervbo, Ulrik; Westhoff, Timm H; Babel, Nina",Transplantation,579,16

The study investigated the preventive behaviors applied in dentistry settings and the level of fear of COVID-19 infection among dentists. A total of 83 respondents (34.94% male and 63.86% female) were included in the research. Sociodemographic data were collected, together with new institutional and personal rules regarding preventive behaviors. Fear of COVID-19 Scale was used to measure the fear of infection. Data was analyzed using SPSS (v.25, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). During the first seven months of confinement, 3.9% of dentists were confirmed with COVID-19 and one fourth treated confirmed positive patients. A quarter of the doctors declared that they had periods when they lived away from home being afraid of transmitting the disease to their family members, and significant data were found in doctors being parents. The closure of dental offices had a negative impact on the financial situation of dentists, especially on those working in rural area offices. Many doctors encountered difficulties in purchasing protective suits and medical supplies, and more than half of the respondents (65.1%, N = 54) focused on the quality of protective suits when purchasing them. More than half of the dentists were trained how to use them. The score for fear of COVID 19 was similar to dentists from other countries. Respondents with chronic diseases were more prone to show higher level of anxiety when following the news and stories related to COVID-19 on TV, media, or social networks. One third of dentists mentioned that they had treated exclusively specific urgent dental problems since the onset of the pandemic and more than 13.3% declared that they refused to provide medical assistance to some specific pathologies because of the fear of infection. The results reflect new challenges and rules adopted by dentists in order to diminish the risk of infection and the impact of pandemic considering their psychological, familial, and financial context. Policymakers and professional associations around may benefit from these findings while formulating guidelines to support dentists during COVID-19 or any future pandemics.","Iurcov, R.; Pop, L.

However, as GFP is a small soluble protein, it easily crosses membranes if cell integrity is disrupted, and GFP signal is lost or diffuse if the specimen is not fixed beforehand. While pre-fixation is often feasible for histological analyses, many molecular biology procedures and new imaging techniques, such as imaging mass spectrometry, require unfixed specimens. To be able to use GFP labeling in tissues prepared for such applications, we have tested various protocols to minimize the loss of GFP signal. Here we show that, in cryocut sections of snap-frozen brain tissue from two GFP reporter mouse lines, leaking of the GFP signal is prevented by omitting the commonly performed drying of the cryosections, and by direct post-fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde pre-warmed at 30-37 °C. Although the GFP staining does not reach the same quality as obtained with pre-fixed tissue, GFP localization within the cells that express it is preserved with this method. This protocol can thus be used to identify GFP positive cells on sections originating from unfixed, cryosectioned tissue.","Scandella, Valentina; Paolicelli, Rosa Chiara; Knobloch, Marlen",Sci Rep,579,14

Finland is a country with extraordinary sauna culture and bathing opportunities. However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic introduced regulations and unprecedented closures to shared sauna facilities. In this study we aimed to examine the previously unknown baseline bathing frequency and its possible change during the epidemic. DESIGN: We investigated several aspects of sauna bathing with self-reports: the frequency, its possible changes, reasons for change, and beliefs about its health effects among a representative sample of thousand Finns aged 18-75 years. This online survey was administered in May 2020. RESULTS: Before the pandemic, 59 % of our respondents had enjoyed sauna at least once a week. Since the pandemic began, up to 23 % had reduced or stopped their bathing. This was often due to restricted sauna access. However, 11 % of respondents bathed more frequently and attributed this change to seeking relaxation and passing time. These findings demonstrate a surprising flexibility in this health-promoting national pastime. Men were more active bathers than women overall and women under 35 enjoy sauna more seldom than older women. Only 7.9 % of all respondents bathed at least four times a week, exceeding a suggested threshold for maximum health benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Finnish people are active sauna bathers. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that the frequency of bathing is dependent on good access to sauna facilities. This flexibility and wide access could be exploited to improve public health in the long term if more frequent bathing became a standard.","Liikkanen, Lassi A; Laukkanen, Jari A",Complement Ther Med,579,1

We hypothesize a consequence of COVID-19 is reduced operative volume across the country. We aim to examine changes in volume of common gastrointestinal operations during COVID-19, including elective, urgent/emergent, and cancer operations. We also evaluate if hospitals with more COVID-19 admissions were most impacted. METHODS: The Vizient database was used to determine monthly operative volume from November 2019 to June 2020 for elective operations (hiatal hernia repairs, bariatric surgery), urgent operations (cholecystectomies, appendectomies, inguinal hernia repairs), and cancer operations (colectomies, gastrectomies, esophagectomies). COVID-19 admissions per hospital were also determined. November 2019-January 2020 was defined as ""pre-COVID."" The monthly reduction in volume from pre-COVID was calculated for each operation. The top quartile (25%) of hospitals with the most COVID admissions were also evaluated separately from hospitals with fewer COVID cases. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance. RESULTS: Data from 559 hospitals were analyzed. The volumes of all operations evaluated were significantly reduced during the pandemic except gastrectomies and esophagectomies for cancer. The greatest reduction in all operations was in April. In April, the volume of bariatric surgery reduced by 98% (P < 0.001), hiatal hernia repairs by 96% (P < 0.001), urgent cholecystectomies by 42% (P < 0.001), urgent inguinal hernia repairs by 40% (P < 0.001), urgent appendectomies by 24% (P < 0.001), and colectomies for cancer by 39% (P < 0.001). Hospitals with the most COVID-19 admissions had greater reductions in all operations than hospitals with fewer COVID cases. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus pandemic led to a significant reduction in volume of all gastrointestinal operations evaluated except gastrectomies and esophagectomies.

This study focuses on the following questions: what is the new interest to telework for employees and what are the potential reasons for this? How much employees feel able to do their work remotely now and why? To answer these questions, we conducted a survey over several weeks, that involved employees coming from different industries (N=170), in order to collect their experience, skills and motivations for teleworking. The results show that adoption of telework is real for the respondents. Those who have experienced it present a strong motivation and a real capacity to use it, with almost no technological barriers. The theoretical model that we used, based on Technology Acceptance Models (TAM), has highlighted an important new factor of telework adoption: time saved in commuting. The study points out that adoption of telework could be sustainable for both public and private organizations, and this requires a critical examination and discussion.","Berberat, Steve; Rosat, Damien; Kouadio, Armand",,579,1

Consequently, it has received much attention from academics and the retail industry. The aim of this study is to review, identify, and synthesise the psychological causes of panic buying, which is a relatively new and unexplored area in consumer behaviour research. A systematic review of the related literature is conducted. The review suggests that panic buying is influenced by (1) individuals' perception of the threat of the health crisis and scarcity of products; (2) fear of the unknown, which is caused by negative emotions and uncertainty; (3) coping behaviour, which views panic buying as a venue to relieve anxiety and regain control over the crisis; and (4) social psychological factors, which account for the influence of the social network of an individual. This study contributes to the literature by consolidating the scarce and scattered research on the causes of panic buying, drawing greater theoretical insights into each cause and also offers some implications for health professionals, policy makers, and retailers on implementing appropriate policies and strategies to manage panic buying.

We show here that an anti-SEB monoclonal antibody (mAb), 6D3, can bind this viral motif at its polybasic (PRRA) insert to inhibit infection in live virus assays. The overlap between the superantigenic site of the spike and its proteolytic cleavage site suggests that the mAb prevents viral entry by interfering with the proteolytic activity of cell proteases (furin and TMPRSS2). The high affinity of 6D3 for this site originates from a polyacidic segment at its heavy chain CDR2. The study points to the potential utility of 6D3 for possibly treating COVID-19, MIS-C, or common colds caused by human coronaviruses that also possess a furin-like cleavage site.","Cheng, Mary Hongying; Porritt, Rebecca A; Rivas, Magali Noval; Krieger, James M; Ozdemir, Asli Beyza; Garcia, Gustavo; Arumugaswami, Vaithilingaraja; Fries, Bettina C; Arditi, Moshe; Bahar, Ivet",,579,13

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Only patients aged between 3 and 16 years, who had started treatment before the lockdown and had spent this periodwith both parents were included in the study. The interviews were carried out using an anonymous questionnaire that assessed school and play activities, the type of diet, the time dedicated to home oral hygiene and the activities carried out with parents. Parents' work situation during lockdown was included to correlate it with time spent at home. The Frankl Behavior Rating Scale was used to determine the degree of cooperation during dental sessions pre- and post-lockdown. Chi-square test and Fisher's Exact tests were used to identify statistical associations of improvement with each categorical variable. Student's t-test was used to highlight the differences in mean values of continuous variables between subjects considered more cooperative and unimproved subjects. Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the model. Assumption of linearity of independent variables and log-odds were assessed by Box-Tidwell transformation. Final selection was carried out using the Akaike criterion and all statistical analyses were carried out using the STATA statistical software package. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 212 patients (103F; 109M). The age ranged between 3 and 16 years with an average age of 9.03 years; 82.08% (95% CI 76.24-86.99) of the subjects showed an improvement in collaboration compared to pre-lockdown. Logistic analysis reveals a statistically significant increase of the odds of improvement in patients with a lower pre-lockdown collaboration (OR: 6.05, p = 0.001), in children with a parental presence at home (jobless, OR : 30.55, p <0.001; in ""smart working"", OR: 23.06, p <0.001) when compared to children whose parents work away from home. From a further exploratory analysis, time dedicated to home oral hygiene was increased if associated with an increased presence of the parents at home (p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Changes in family routines and increased parental presence at home, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, are associated with improved collaboration of children during dental sessions.

As advanced AD is difficult to manage, accurate diagnosis of the disorder is critical. Previous studies have revealed effective deep learning methods of classification. However, deep learning methods require a large number of image datasets. Moreover, medical images are affected by various environmental factors. In the current study, we propose a deep learning-based method for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is less sensitive to different datasets for external validation, based upon F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT). RESULTS: The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of our proposed network were 86.09%, 80.00%, and 92.96% (respectively) using our dataset, and 91.02%, 87.93%, and 93.57% (respectively) using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We observed that our model classified AD and normal cognitive (NC) cases based on the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), where pathological changes occur in AD. The performance of the GAP layer was considered statistically significant compared to the fully connected layer in both datasets for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p < 0.01). In addition, performance comparison between the ADNI dataset and our dataset showed no statistically significant differences in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model demonstrated the effectiveness of AD classification using the GAP layer. Our model learned the AD features from PCC in both the ADNI and Severance datasets, which can be seen in the heatmap. Furthermore, we showed that there were no significant differences in performance using statistical analysis.","Kim, Han Woong; Lee, Ha Eun; Oh, KyeongTaek; Lee, Sangwon; Yun, Mijin; Yoo, Sun K",Biomed Eng Online,579,1

Due to an increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) transmission, elective surgical treatment has been suspended in many centers. The effects of COVID-19 in the early post-operative period after esophagectomy remains unknown. In this report, we present three cases of patients diagnosed with esophago-gastric junction cancer who were scheduled for elective esophagectomy with a curative intention during second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in a single high-volume tertiary center. Despite all available safety measures, one of the patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia on post-operative day two, leading to an impaired respiratory function and increased pleural fluid collection from the chest tube, resulting in a prolonged time of hospital stay. Finding a good balance between the COVID-19-related perioperative risks and consequences of delaying surgical treatment in patients diagnosed with esophago-gastric cancer is a challenge. In order to achieve the best possible outcome, care must be taken to ensure availability of necessary treatment options and to reduce the risk of SARS-Cov-2 transmission perioperatively.","Nurczyk, Kamil; Chan, Chia-En; Nowak, Norbert; Skoczylas, Tomasz",Curr Oncol,579,20

One of the world's largest annual gatherings, Arbaeen, occurs in Iraq. We studied respiratory symptoms and risk and protective factors using representative sampling of Arbaeen pilgrims in 2019 to inform prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Structured sampling was used to recruit walking pilgrims. A questionnaire asked about respiratory symptoms, risk, and preventive factors, including hygiene-related resources of toilet facilities. The commonest symptom reported by the 1842 participants (63.3% male, 36.7% female) was cough (25.6%). Eating in mawkibs (rest areas) with indoor kitchens and drinking only packaged water were associated with lower risk of cough (AOR = 0.72, CI = 0.56-0.94; AOR = 0.60; CI = 0.45-0.78, p < 0.05). Facemask use was associated with increased risk of cough (AOR = 2.71, CI = 2.08-3.53, p < 0.05). Handwashing was not protective against cough, or against (one or more of) cough, fever, or breathlessness in multivariate analysis. Toilet facilities often lacked running water (32.1%) and soap (26.1%), and had shared hand towels (17%). To reduce risk of respiratory infections including COVID-19 during Arbaeen or other mass gatherings, needs include running water, soap, and hygienic hand drying options or hand sanitiser. Education on proper handwashing and facemask approaches and monitoring around food preparation and eating spaces are needed.","Al-Ansari, Farah; Mirzaei, Masoud; Al-Ansari, Basma; Al-Ansari, Mohammad Basim; Abdulzahra, Mohammed Saeed; Rashid, Harunor; Hill-Cawthorne, Grant A; Al Ansari, Mustafa; Negin, Joel; Conigrave, Katherine",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),579,1

These restrictions were justified on the basis the health system may be overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases and in order to prevent deaths. Governments are now considering how they may de-escalate these restrictions. This article argues that an appropriate approach may be to lift the general lockdown but implement selective isolation of the elderly. While this discriminates against the elderly, there is a morally relevant difference-the elderly are far more likely to require hospitalisation and die than the rest of the population. If the aim is to ensure the health system is not overwhelmed and to reduce the death rate, preventing the elderly from contracting the virus may be an effective means of achieving this. The alternative is to continue to keep everyone in lockdown. It is argued that this is levelling down equality and is unethical. It suggests that in order for the elderly to avoid contracting the virus, the whole population should have their liberty deprived, even though the same result could be achieved by only restricting the liberty of the elderly. Similar arguments may also be applied to all groups at increased risk of COVID-19, such as men and those with comorbidities, the obese and people from ethnic minorities or socially deprived groups. This utilitarian concern must be balanced against other considerations, such as equality and justice, and the benefits gained from discriminating in these ways must be proportionately greater than the negative consequences of doing so. Such selective discrimination will be most justified when the liberty restriction to a group promotes the well-being of that group (apart from its wider social benefits).","Savulescu, Julian; Cameron, James",J. med. ethics,579,5

MERS-CoV strains from early epidemic clade A and contemporary epidemic clade B have not been phenotypically characterized to compare their abilities to infect cells and mice. In this study, we showed that a clade B virus ChinaGD01 strain caused more severe disease in mice, with delayed viral clearance, increased inflammatory cytokines, and decreased antiviral T cell responses, than the early clade A virus EMC/2012. Given the differences in pathogenicity of different clades of MERS-CoV, periodic assessment of currently circulating MERS-CoV is needed to monitor potential severity of zoonotic disease.","Wang, Yanqun; Sun, Jing; Li, Xiaobo; Zhu, Airu; Guan, Wenda; Sun, De-Qiang; Gan, Mian; Niu, Xuefeng; Dai, Jun; Zhang, Lu; Zhang, Zhaoyong; Shi, Yongxia; Huang, Shuxiang; Mok, Chris Ka Pun; Yang, Zifeng; Wang, Zhongfang; Tan, Wenjie; Li, Yimin; Chen, Ling; Chen, Rongchang; Peiris, Malik; Zhong, Nanshan; Zhao, Jingxian; Huang, Jicheng; Zhao, Jincun",J. virol,579,16

METHODS: Secondary analysis from the PRoVENT-COVID study. The PRoVENT-COVID is a national, multicenter, retrospective observational study done at 22 intensive care units in the Netherlands. Consecutive patients aged at least 18 years were eligible for participation if they had received invasive ventilation for COVID-19 at a participating ICU during the first month of the national outbreak in the Netherlands. The aim was to quantify the dynamics and determine the prognostic value of surrogate markers of wasted ventilation in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS. RESULTS: A total of 927 consecutive patients admitted with COVID-19-related ARDS were included in this study. Estimations of wasted ventilation such as the estimated dead space fraction (by Harris-Benedict and direct method) and ventilatory ratio were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors at baseline and during the following days of mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). The end-tidal-to-arterial PCO2 ratio was lower in non-survivors than in survivors (p < 0.001). As ARDS severity increased, mortality increased with successive tertiles of dead space fraction by Harris-Benedict and by direct estimation, and with an increase in the VR. The same trend was observed with decreased levels in the tertiles for the end-tidal-to-arterial PCO2 ratio. After adjustment for a base risk model that included chronic comorbidities and ventilation- and oxygenation-parameters, none of the dead space estimates measured at the start of ventilation or the following days were significantly associated with 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant impairment of ventilation in the early course of COVID-19-related ARDS but quantification of this impairment does not add prognostic information when added to a baseline risk model.

Administrators are currently faced with decisions about whether to open during the pandemic and what modifications of their normal operations might be necessary to protect students, faculty and staff. There is little information, however, on what measures are likely to be most effective and whether existing interventions could contain the spread of an outbreak on campus. We develop a full-scale stochastic agent-based model to determine whether in-person instruction could safely continue during the pandemic and evaluate the necessity of various interventions. Simulation results indicate that large scale randomized testing, contact-tracing, and quarantining are important components of a successful strategy for containing campus outbreaks. High test specificity is critical for keeping the size of the quarantine population manageable. Moving the largest classes online is also crucial for controlling both the size of outbreaks and the number of students in quarantine. Increased residential exposure can significantly impact the size of an outbreak, but it is likely more important to control non-residential social exposure among students. Finally, necessarily high quarantine rates even in controlled outbreaks imply significant absenteeism, indicating a need to plan for remote instruction of quarantined students.","Gressman, Philip T; Peck, Jennifer R",Math Biosci,579,16

Resurgences of COVID-19 have also been observed in many other countries. In Guangzhou, China, a small outbreak, involving less than 100 residents, emerged in March and April 2020, and comprehensive and near-real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted. When the numbers of confirmed cases among overseas travelers increased, public health measures were enhanced by shifting from self-quarantine to central quarantine and SARS-CoV-2 testing for all overseas travelers. In an analysis of 109 imported cases, we found diverse viral variants distributed in the global viral phylogeny, which were frequently shared within households but not among passengers on the same flight. In contrast to the viral diversity of imported cases, local transmission was predominately attributed to two specific variants imported from Africa, including local cases that reported no direct or indirect contact with imported cases. The introduction events of the virus were identified or deduced before the enhanced measures were taken. These results show the interventions were effective in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and they rule out the possibility of cryptic transmission of viral variants from the first wave in January and February 2020. Our study provides evidence and emphasizes the importance of controls for overseas travelers in the context of the pandemic and exemplifies how viral genomic data can facilitate COVID-19 surveillance and inform public health mitigation strategies.","Jia, Hong-Ling; Li, Peng; Liu, Hong-Jie; Zhong, Jia-Yong; Qin, Peng-Zhe; Su, Wen-Zhe; Zheng, Ying-Feng; Li, Kui-Biao; Zeng, Qing; Li, Jin-Hui; Li, Li-Zhong; Cao, Lan; Wu, Ji-Bin; Chen, Yi-Yun; Jia, Lei-Li; Song, Hong-Bin; Zhang, Qi-Wei; Yang, Guang; Jing, Chun-Xia; Bo, Xiao-Chen; Zhang, Zhou-Bin; Di, Biao; Xiao, Chuan-Le; Ni, Ming",J Clin Microbiol,579,1

OBJECTIVES: This study compared the risk of initiation of antipsychotic medications among older adults with dementia treated with the ChEIs donepezil, rivastigmine, or galantamine. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used multiyear (2013-2015) Medicare claims data involving Parts A, B, and D. The study sample included community-dwelling older adults (aged &#8805; 65 years) with a diagnosis of dementia. The study identified new users of ChEIs and followed them for up to 180 days for antipsychotic initiation. The ChEIs included donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, whereas antipsychotics included typical and atypical agents. Donepezil was used as the reference category as it is the most commonly used ChEI and only acts on acetylcholinesterase, whereas both rivastigmine and galantamine have dual mechanisms of action. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression compared the risk of and time to antipsychotic initiation among the three ChEIs, adjusting for other risk factors. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 178,441 older adults with dementia who were new users of ChEIs. A total of 23,433 (15.14%) donepezil users, 4114 (19.04%) rivastigmine users, and 324 (15.77%) galantamine users initiated antipsychotics. The mean time to antipsychotic initiation among patients who received antipsychotics was 109.29 ± 69.72 days for donepezil users, 96.70 ± 71.60 days for rivastigmine users, and 104.15 ± 72.53 days for galantamine users. The Cox regression analysis showed that rivastigmine (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.34) was significantly associated with antipsychotic initiation compared with donepezil, whereas no significant difference was observed between galantamine and donepezil (aHR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.81-1.20). CONCLUSION: The study found a 27% increased risk of antipsychotic initiation among users of rivastigmine compared with donepezil users. There was no difference between galantamine and donepezil for antipsychotic initiation. Although the limitations of the study should be considered, the results suggest that donepezil or galantamine may be more appropriate treatments for older patients with dementia, to minimize antipsychotic use.","Rege, Sanika; Carnahan, Ryan M; Johnson, Michael L; Chen, Hua; Holmes, Holly M; Aparasu, Rajender R",Drugs aging,579,16

METHODS: A model comprising a human cadaveric corneoscleral rim mounted on an artificial anterior chamber was used. Three-port 25 gauge vitrectomy simulated surgery was performed with any visible aerosol production recorded using high-speed 4K camera. The following were assessed: (1) vitrector at maximum cut rate in static and dynamic conditions inside the model, (2) vitrector at air-fluid interface in a physical model, (3) passive fluid-air exchange with a backflush hand piece, (4) valved cannulas under air, and (5) a defective valved cannula under air. RESULTS: No visible aerosol or droplets were identified when the vitrector was used within the model. In the physical model, no visible aerosol or droplets were seen when the vitrector was engaged at the air-fluid interface. Droplets were produced from the opening of backflush hand piece during passive fluid-air exchange. No visible aerosol was produced from the intact valved cannulas under air pressure, but droplets were seen at the beginning of fluid-air exchange when the valved cannula was defective. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of visible aerosol generation during simulated vitrectomy surgery with competent valved cannulas. In the physical model, no visible aerosol was generated by the high-speed vitrector despite cutting at the air-fluid interface.","Liyanage, Sidath; Ramasamy, Pathma; Elhaddad, Omar; Darcy, Kieren; Hudson, Andrew; Keller, Johannes",,579,20

Over the past few months, COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic, with over 400,000 documented cases globally as of March 24, 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, but has been shown to have effective human-to-human transmission. COVID-19 results in mild symptoms in the majority of infected patients, but can cause severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and death. Given the novel nature of COVID-19, no established treatment beyond supportive care exists currently, but extensive public-health measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented globally to curb the spread of disease, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and protect vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying medical comorbidities. Since this is an emerging infectious disease, there is, as of yet, limited data on the effects of this infection on patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly so for those with congenital heart disease. We summarize herewith the early experience with COVID-19 and consider the potential applicability to and implications for patients with cardiovascular disease in general and congenital heart disease in particular.","Tan, Weiyi; Aboulhosn, Jamil",Int J Cardiol,579,6

Background: COVID-19-associated morbidity is correlated with multiple factors including age, comorbidities, and host response to the virus. Our understanding of the risk of critical illness due to prior neurological conditions remains limited. Here, we hypothesized that prior cerebrovascular disease is a risk factor for severe outcomes in COVID-19, including increased duration of MV. Design/Methods: A cross-sectional study of 1128 consecutive adult patients admitted to a tertiary care center in Boston, Massachusetts, and diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. The association between history of cerebrovascular disease and critical illness defined as MV or death was examined using logistic regression with inverse probability weighting of the propensity score. Cumulative incidence of successful extubation without death over 45 days was examined using competing risk analysis. Results: Of the 1128 adults admitted with COVID-19, 350 (36%) were critically ill by day 28. The median age was 59 years (standard deviation: 18 years), 640 (57%) were men, and 401 (36%) were Latinx ethnicity. As of June 2nd, 2020, 127 (11%) patients died. A total of 257 (23%) of patients had a prior neurological diagnosis;most common was cerebrovascular disease (16%). Prior cerebrovascular disease was significantly associated with critical illness (OR 1.54 [95% CI: 1.14 - 2.07]), lower rate of successful extubation (cause-specific HR 0.57 [95% CI: 0.33-0.98]), and increased duration of intubation (restricted mean time difference 4.02 days [95% CI: 0.34- 10.92]) compared to patients without cerebrovascular disease. Conclusions: History of cerebrovascular disease adversely affects COVID-19 outcomes including increased risk of critical illness and prolonged intubation.

METHOD: In our study, we included patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer in the general surgery clinic between the dates 03.20.2020 and 05.20.2020, when the hospital was declared COVID-19 pandemic hospital. Emergency colorectal cancer surgeries such as ileus and perforation were excluded from the study. RESULTS: While in the status of pandemic hospital, 80 COVID-19 (+) and 563 COVID-19 (+) suspicious patients were treated.

METHOD: Multicenter, prospective cohort study, conducted in 17 pediatric intensive care units in five states in Brazil, from March to July 2020. Patients from 1 month to 19 years who met the MIS-C diagnostic criteria were included consecutively. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were included, with the following conditions: Kawasaki-like disease (nâ¯=â¯26), incomplete Kawasaki disease (nâ¯=â¯16), acute cardiac dysfunction (nâ¯=â¯10), toxic shock syndrome (nâ¯=â¯3), and macrophage activation syndrome (nâ¯=â¯1). Median age was 6.2 years (IQR 2.4-10.3), 70% were boys, 59% were non-whites, 20% had comorbidities, 48% reported a contact with COVID-19 cases, and 55% had a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR and/or serology. Gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 71%, shock symptoms in 59%, and severe respiratory symptoms in less than 20%. d-Dimer was increased in 80% and cardiac dysfunction markers in more than 75%. Treatment included immunoglobulin (89%); corticosteroids, antibiotics, and enoxaparin in about 50%; and oseltamivir and antifungal therapy in less than 10%. Only 11% needed invasive mechanical ventilation, with a median duration of five days (IQR 5-6.5). The median length of PICU stay was six days (IQR 5-11), and one death occurred (1.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Most characteristics of the present MIS-C patients were similar to that of other cohorts. The present results may contribute to a broader understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and its short-term consequences. Long-term multidisciplinary follow-up is needed, since it is not known whether these patients will have chronic cardiac impairment or other sequelae.","Lima-Setta, Fernanda; Magalhães-Barbosa, Maria Clara de; Rodrigues-Santos, Gustavo; Figueiredo, Elaine Augusta das Neves; Jacques, Melissa de Lorena; Zeitel, Raquel de Seixas; Sapolnik, Roberto; Borges, Cibelle Teixeira da Siva; Lanziotti, Vanessa Soares; Castro, Roberta Esteves Vieira de; Bellinat, Ana Paula Novaes; Silva, Thiago Peres da; Oliveira, Felipe Rezende Caino de; Reis, Bárbara Carvalho Santos Dos; Castro, Natália Almeida de Arnaldo Silva Rodriguez; Macedo, João Henrique Garcia Cobas; Scarlato, Ana Carolina Cabral Pinheiro; Riveiro, Paula Marins; Mota, Isabele Coelho Fonseca da; Lorenzo, Vivian Botelho; Lucena, Natalia Martins Lima de; Azevedo, Zina Maria Almeida de; Cunha, Antonio José L A; Prata-Barbosa, Arnaldo",,579,26

On the basis of a longitudinal study, we investigated the importance of these factors in predicting PDB. METHODS: The participants were 347 adolescents residing in Italy.

RESULTS: After the COVID-19 national lockdown, adolescents experienced fewer positive emotions and more negative emotions compared with 1 year earlier. Nevertheless, these emotional changes, and adolescents' personality (except for openness to experiences), were not related to the adoption of PDB. Instead, the autonomous motivation of adolescents significantly predicted a higher likelihood to adopt PDB by increasing the intention to engage in this behavior and, more indirectly, by substantially decreasing moral disengagement, which was negatively related to PDB. In contrast, controlled motivation corresponded to significantly higher levels of moral disengagement and predicted less likelihood of adopting PDB.

Experimental studies justify that among respiratory virus infected mice, a weaker ER signaling leads to increased morbidity and mortality in both males and females. In animal experiments, estrogen treatment silences the inflammatory reactions and decreases virus titers leading to improved survival rate; it seems to be an ideal prevention and therapy against COVID-19. We should overcome the widespread reluctance to estrogen therapy as we have a unique estrogen formula; conjugated estrogens, or conjugated equine estrogens available under the brand name of Premarin deriving from natural sources. Premarin can exert similar ER upregulative and gene repairing power like endogenous estrogen without any risk for adverse reactions.

ASC protein is an adaptor protein present in several inflammasome complexes that performs several intra- and extracellular functions, in monomeric form or as ASC specks, during physiological and pathological processes related to inflammation and adaptive immunity. Extracellular ASC specks (eASC specks) released during cell death by pyroptosis can contribute as a danger signal to the propagation of inflammation via phagocytosis and activation of surrounding cells. ASC specks are found in the circulation of patients with chronic inflammatory diseases and have been considered as relevant blood biomarkers of inflammation. eASC amplifies the inflammatory signal, may induce the production of autoantibodies, transports molecules that bind to this complex, contributing to the generation of antibodies, and can induce the maturation of cytokines promoting the modelling of the adaptive immunity. Although several advances have been registered in the last 21 years, there are numerous unknown or enigmatic gaps in the understanding of the role of eASC specks in the organism. Here, we provide an overview about the ASC protein focusing on the probable roles of eASC specks in several diseases, up to the most recent studies concerning COVID-19.","de Souza, Jean Gabriel; Starobinas, Nancy; Ibañez, Olga Celia Martinez",Immunology,579,1

Currently, drugs originally developed for other viruses or parasites are currently in clinical trials based on empiric data. In the quest of an effective antiviral drug, the most specific target for an RNA virus is the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) which shows significant differences between positive-sense and negative-sense RNA viruses. An accurate evaluation of RdRps from different viruses may guide the development of new drugs or the repositioning of already approved antiviral drugs as treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

Yeast isolates from patients' blood were identified by 21-plex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing, then subjected to antifungal susceptibility testing according to the CLSI M27-A3 protocol. Among 1988 patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICUs, seven had fungemia (7/1988;0.03%), among whom six had CAC. The mortality of the limited CAC cases was high and greatly exceeded that of patients with COVID-19 but without candidemia (100% (6/6) vs. 22.7% (452/1988)). In total, nine yeast isolates were collected from patients with fungemia: five Candida albicans, three C. glabrata, and one Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. Half of the patients infected with C. albicans (2/4) were refractory to both azoles and echinocandins. The high mortality of patients with CAC, despite antifungal therapy, reflects the severity of the disease in these patients and underscores the importance of rapid diagnosis and timely initiation of antifungal treatment.","Arastehfar, A.; Shaban, T.; Zarrinfar, H.; Roudbary, M.; Ghazanfari, M.; Hedayati, M.

The Case of Migrant Children in Poland,16.877398,4.6995597,2021,"BACKGROUND: Parental anxiety about young people's use of media has increased with the advent of Generation Alpha. Excessive consumption is assumed to lead to a sedentary lifestyle, psychiatric disorders, overconsumption of sexual content and suicidal behaviour. But are these assumptions valid? METHODS: We supplemented data from the 2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Study for Belgium with a bibliographical search of online databases (Medline, Scopus, PsycArticles, PsycInfo, PubMed) with the keywords 'adolescent' - 'internet' and 'sedentarity' or 'suicide' or 'family' or 'sex*' or 'porno*' for articles published between 2014 and 2019. We selected 27 original research articles and/ or quantitative or qualitative meta-analyses. RESULTS: Total consumption of different media (television, video games, internet) remained stable until 2010, and significantly increased in 2014. No parallel increase in sedentarity was reported. Controversy continues to surround the quantification of overconsumption, and the definition of 'problematic use'. Nevertheless, it appears that 5% of young people have unusual internet use, and 97.5% of these meet the criteria for a mental disorder. The risk of overconsumption is related to four factors: familial, personality, peer influence and supply. These general factors are supplemented by specific factors related to the abuse of sexual content and suicidal behaviour. For the latter, specific risk factors are the same as for suicidal young people who are not influenced by social media. CONCLUSION: Even if screen time is higher for Generation Alpha, these young people are no more at risk unless they accumulate risk factors. They are also exposed to challenges that researchers have not yet studied in any depth. One question relates to how they can manage their privacy if their parents published, without their consent, photographs of them as children? Another issue is their relationship to knowledge, given that everything they need to know can easily be found online.","Zdanowicz, Nicolas; Reynaert, Christine; Jacques, Denis; Lepiece, Brice; Dubois, Thomas",Psychiatr Danub,579,29

Epitope mapping, X-ray crystallography, and cryo-electron microscopy revealed two distinct antigenic sites and showed two neutralizing nanobodies from different epitope classes bound simultaneously to the spike trimer. Nanobody-Fc fusions of the four most potent nanobodies blocked ACE2 engagement with RBD variants present in human populations and potently neutralized both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the N501Y D614G variant at concentrations as low as 0.1 nM. Prophylactic administration of either single nanobody-Fc or as mixtures reduced viral loads by up to 104-fold in mice infected with the N501Y D614G SARS-CoV-2 virus.

A growing number of studies have shown worsening mental health measures globally during the pandemic. However, there is a lack of empirical study on how people support their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine a number of formal and informal mental health support. Further, it explored factors that might be associated with the use of different types mental health support. METHODS: Data from 26,720 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed between 13th April 2020 and 3rd July 2020. Data were analysed using logistic and Poisson regression models. RESULTS: About 45% of people reported talking to friends or family members to support their mental health, 43% engaging in self-care activities, 20% taking medication, 9% speaking to mental health professionals, 8% talking to a GP or other health professional, and another 8% using helpline or online services. Gender, education, living status, loneliness, pre-existing mental health conditions, general depression and anxiety, coping and personality were found to be associated with the use of mental health support. CONCLUSION: While the negative impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are inevitable, people can play an active role in managing their mental health. Understanding the patterns and predictors of various kinds of mental health support during the pandemic is crucial for future service planning and delivery through recognising potential barriers to mental health care faced by certain groups.","Bu, Feifei; Mak, Hei Wan; Fancourt, Daisy",Soc. psychiatr. psychiatr. epidemiol,579,16

METHODS: From 13 March to 9 April 2020, all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and discharged alive were included in this retrospective observational study. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of 30-day readmission, and a restricted cubic spline function was utilized to assess the linearity of the association between continuous predictors and 30-day readmission. RESULTS: A total of 1062 patients were included in the analysis, with a median follow-up time of 62 days. The mean age of patients was 56.5 years, and 40.5% were women. At the end of the study, a total of 48 (4.5%) patients were readmitted within 30 days of discharge, and a median time to readmission was 5 days. The most common primary diagnosis of 30-day readmission was a hypoxic respiratory failure (68.8%) followed by thromboembolism (12.5%) and sepsis (6.3%). The patients with a peak serum creatinine level of &#8805;1.29 mg/dL during the index hospitalization, compared to those with a creatinine of <1.29 mg/dL, had 2.4 times increased risk of 30-day readmission (adjusted odds ratio: 2.41; 95% CI: 1.23-4.74). The mortality rate during the readmission was 22.9%. CONCLUSION: With 4.5% of the thirty-day readmission rate, COVID-19 survivors were readmitted early after hospital discharge, mainly due to morbidities of COVID-19.

The development of methods to effectively decontaminate N95 respirators while maintaining their integrity is crucial for respirator regeneration and reuse. In this study, we systematically evaluated five respirator decontamination methods using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) or ultraviolet (254 nm wavelength, UVC) radiation. Through testing the bioburden, filtration, fluid resistance, and fit (shape) of the decontaminated respirators, we found that the decontamination methods using BioQuell VHP, custom VHP container, Steris VHP, and Sterrad VHP effectively inactivated Cardiovirus (3-log10 reduction) and bacteria (6-log10 reduction) without compromising the respirator integrity after 2-15 cycles. Hope UVC system was capable of inactivating Cardiovirus (3-log10 reduction) but exhibited relatively poorer bactericidal activity. These methods are capable of decontaminating 10-1000 respirators per batch with varied decontamination times (10-200 min). Our findings show that N95 respirators treated by the previously mentioned decontamination methods are safe and effective for reuse by industry, laboratories, and hospitals.","Wang, C.

This study aims to determine whether active surveillance of patients with leprosy and their contact individuals increased identification of latent leprosy cases in the low-endemic areas. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was carried out between October 2014 and August 2016 in 21 counties throughout Shandong Province. The survey was conducted among patients with leprosy released from treatment (RFT) and their contacts from both household and neighbors. RESULTS: A total of 2,210 RFT patients and 9,742 contacts comprising 7877 household contacts (HHCs), including 5,844 genetic related family members (GRFMs) and 2033 non-genetic related family members and 1,865 contacts living in neighboring houses (neighbor contacts, NCs), were recruited. Among identified individuals, one relapsed and 13 were newly diagnosed, giving a detection rate of 0.12%, corresponding to 120 times the passive case detection rate. Detection rates were similar for HHCs and NCs (0.114% vs. 0.214%, P = 0.287). Analysis of the family history of leprosy patients revealed clustering of newly diagnosed cases and association with residential coordinates of previously-diagnosed multibacillary leprosy cases. CONCLUSION: Active case-finding programs are feasible and contributes to early case detection by tracking HHCs and NCs in low-endemic areas.","Wang, Na; Chu, Tongsheng; Li, Furong; Wang, Zhenzhen; Liu, Dianchang; Chen, Mingfei; Wang, Honglei; Niu, Guiye; Liu, Dan; Zhang, Mingkai; Xu, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Yan; Li, Jinghui; Li, Zhen; You, Jiabao; Mao, Liguo; Li, Huaizhang; Chen, Yongjin; Liu, Hong; Zhang, Furen",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,579,16

Morbidity and mortality caused by this virus are alarming for the possible increased threat to human health. A Suitable diagnostic test is the prerequisite for designing and developing control measures. But, the tests being employed at present possess one or the other drawback for this disease diagnosis. During the dengue virus infections, NS2B is essential for the stability and catalytic activity of the NS3 protease. N-terminal 185 amino acids of NS3 protease domain along with hydrophilic portion of NS2B (NS2BNS3pro) is being used to screen dengue inhibitors but not for diagnosis until now. In the present study, we have used purified NS2BNS3pro as an antigen to trap anti-NS2BNS3pro antibodies of the clinical samples. Antibodies were detected successfully in both western blotting and ELISA tests. In ELISA, antibodies were detected in both primary and secondary infections of all serotypes. Interestingly, 17 samples declared as other febrile infections by NS1 and IgM/IgG tests were found to be positive in present test, which were further confirmed by RT-PCR. In silico studies suggested the absence of conserved epitopes between NS2BNS3pro and the counterpart in JEV, Zika, and CHIKV, indicating less possibility of crossreaction, which was in turn confirmed by using synthetic peptides representing the above epitopes. Statistical analysis with 76% specificity, 87% sensitivity, and 95% concordance also supported the present test as a suitable test for large scale diagnosis of dengue virus infections.

Consequently, patients with pre-existing rheumatic diseases in Switzerland were confronted with an acute drug shortage.We have therefore designed, produced and characterized a generic HCQ drug formulation. The proposed HCQ formulation can be manufactured by using a minimal number of operation steps (mixing, wet granulation, sieving, blending, compression) and readily available pharmaceutical excipients.HCQ tablets were manufactured by granulation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), blending with the external phase and compaction using a non instrumented single punch tablet press. Analytics and identification of the API was performed by a combination of NMR, ESI-MS, FTIR and HPLC.

It was recognised that such restrictions could have profound impact on residents and their families. Nonetheless, these measures were strictly imposed over a prolonged period in many countries; impeding families from remaining involved in their relatives' care and diluting the meaningful connections for residents with society. It is timely to explore the impact of public health measures on people living in nursing homes from an ethical perspective. In order to foreground the ethical dimensions of the implications of visitor restrictions in nursing homes, we compiled an ethical case that reflects some recent experiences of nursing homes residents and their families, in the Irish Republic. We describe a series of events encountered by a woman and her family during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020 and we deploy an ethical decision-making tool to guide and structure our analysis. Our case analysis draws attention to ethical principles that are relevant to explicating the ethical duties and obligations that arise in relation to the interests, well-being, and safety of residents and their families, as well as nursing home staff and the wider community during a pandemic. These include the right of autonomy, trust, minimising harm, and proportionality. We conclude that a number of different strategies should be adopted by nursing homes and relevant regulatory bodies. This includes honest, regular communication between the nursing home staff, the resident and their family. Central to communications is the resident's wishes, their current clinical status and the all-important wider public health obligations. National strategies include mass vaccination, the timely provision of guidance documents and interventions from regulatory bodies that are patient-centred, adaptable, and cost effective.","Hartigan, Irene; Kelleher, Ann; McCarthy, Joan; Cornally, Nicola",Nurs Ethics,579,10

The pandemic changed the healthcare paradox with newer workplace and societal challenges faced by the healthcare personnel. The purpose of this study is to identify the antecedents of workplace and societal challenges faced by the healthcare personnel. Our study conducted in Kolkata and other adjoining areas of West Bengal included respondents who volunteered for individual in-depth interviews. The sample size was kept at n = 20 after due technical considerations. Freelisting and pile sorting was done to generate clusters. The qualitative study identified five constructs with 18 items under workplace challenges and three constructs with five items under societal/community challenges. Workplace challenges included resource availability, adequacy and allocation, financial issues, perceived managerial ineffectiveness, inconsistent guidelines and perceived occupational stress, while societal/community challenges included dread disease, social adaptiveness and challenges related to essential services. A salience threshold was established and the multidimensional scaling provided four major clusters: financial support and sustainability, adaptive resilience, infection risk mitigation and healthcare facility preparedness. Suggestive actions for the identified challenges were summed as enhanced production of diagnostic kits through public–private partnership models and industrial production reforms. Enhanced testing facility for COVID-19 will help to identify new cases. Financial stresses need long-term sustainable alternative that will avoid pay cuts and unemployment.

RNA transcribed from the full-genome cDNA was highly infectious after electroporation into cells, producing 2.9 × 106 plaque-forming unit (PFU)/mL of virus. Compared with a clinical isolate, the infectious-clone-derived SARS-CoV-2 (icSARS-CoV-2) exhibited similar plaque morphology, viral RNA profile, and replication kinetics. Additionally, icSARS-CoV-2 retained engineered molecular markers and did not acquire other mutations. We generated a stable mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 (icSARS-CoV-2-mNG) by introducing this reporter gene into ORF7 of the viral genome. icSARS-CoV-2-mNG was successfully used to evaluate the antiviral activities of interferon (IFN). Collectively, the reverse genetic system and reporter virus provide key reagents to study SARS-CoV-2 and develop countermeasures.","Xie, Xuping; Muruato, Antonio; Lokugamage, Kumari G; Narayanan, Krishna; Zhang, Xianwen; Zou, Jing; Liu, Jianying; Schindewolf, Craig; Bopp, Nathen E; Aguilar, Patricia V; Plante, Kenneth S; Weaver, Scott C; Makino, Shinji; LeDuc, James W; Menachery, Vineet D; Shi, Pei-Yong",Cell Host Microbe,579,21

The dynamics of antibody-secreting plasmablasts and germinal centre B cells induced by these vaccines in humans remain unclear. Here we examined antigen-specific B cell responses in peripheral blood (n = 41) and draining lymph nodes in 14 individuals who had received 2 doses of BNT162b2, an mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) gene1. Circulating IgG- and IgA-secreting plasmablasts that target the S protein peaked one week after the second immunization and then declined, becoming undetectable three weeks later. These plasmablast responses preceded maximal levels of serum anti-S binding and neutralizing antibodies to an early circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as emerging variants, especially in individuals who had previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (who produced the most robust serological responses). By examining fine needle aspirates of draining axillary lymph nodes, we identified germinal centre B cells that bound S protein in all participants who were sampled after primary immunization. High frequencies of S-binding germinal centre B cells and plasmablasts were sustained in these draining lymph nodes for at least 12 weeks after the booster immunization. S-binding monoclonal antibodies derived from germinal centre B cells predominantly targeted the receptor-binding domain of the S protein, and fewer clones bound to the N-terminal domain or to epitopes shared with the S proteins of the human betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1. These latter cross-reactive B cell clones had higher levels of somatic hypermutation as compared to those that recognized only the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which suggests a memory B cell origin. Our studies demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccination of humans induces a persistent germinal centre B cell response, which enables the generation of robust humoral immunity.","Turner, Jackson S; O039,; Halloran, Jane A; Kalaidina, Elizaveta; Kim, Wooseob; Schmitz, Aaron J; Zhou, Julian Q; Lei, Tingting; Thapa, Mahima; Chen, Rita E; Case, James Brett; Amanat, Fatima; Rauseo, Adriana M; Haile, Alem; Xie, Xuping; Klebert, Michael K; Suessen, Teresa; Middleton, William D; Shi, Pei-Yong; Krammer, Florian; Teefey, Sharlene A; Diamond, Michael S; Presti, Rachel M; Ellebedy, Ali H",Nature,579,16

Since the exact number of infected cases is unknown, the number of documented cases was used by many disease transmission models to infer epidemiological parameters. This means that it was possible to produce biased estimates of epidemiological parameters and hence of the effects of intervention measures, because the percentage of all cases that were documented changed during the first 2 months of the epidemic, as a consequence of a gradually improving diagnostic capability. METHODS: To overcome these limitations, we constructed a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) model, accounting for intervention measures and temporal changes in the proportion of new documented infections out of total new infections, to characterize the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan across different stages of the outbreak. Pre-symptomatic transmission was taken into account in our model, and all epidemiological parameters were estimated using the Particle Markov-chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) method. RESULTS: Our model captured the local Wuhan epidemic pattern as two-peak transmission dynamics, with one peak on February 4 and the other on February 12, 2020. The impact of intervention measures determined the timing of the first peak, leading to an 86% drop in the Re from 3.23 (95% CI, 2.22 to 4.20) to 0.45 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.69). The improved diagnostic capability led to the second peak and a higher proportion of documented infections. Our estimated proportion of new documented infections out of the total new infections increased from 11% (95% CI 1-43%) to 28% (95% CI 4-62%) after January 26 when more detection kits were released. After the introduction of a new diagnostic criterion (case definition) on February 12, a higher proportion of daily infected cases were documented (49% (95% CI 7-79%)). CONCLUSIONS: Transportation restrictions and quarantine measures together in Wuhan were able to contain local epidemic growth.","Liang, Jingbo; Yuan, Hsiang-Yu; Wu, Lindsey; Pfeiffer, Dirk Udo",BMC Infect Dis,579,26

However, our knowledge on disease recovery is sparse and concerns about long-term pulmonary impairments are increasing. Causing a broad spectrum of symptoms, COVID-19 can manifest as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the most severely affected patients. Notably, pulmonary infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causing agent of COVID-19, induces diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) followed by fibrotic remodeling and persistent reduced oxygenation in some patients. It is currently not known whether tissue scaring fully resolves or progresses to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. The most aggressive form of pulmonary fibrosis is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a fatal disease that progressively destroys alveolar architecture by uncontrolled fibroblast proliferation and the deposition of collagen and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. It is assumed that micro-injuries to the alveolar epithelium may be induced by inhalation of micro-particles, pathophysiological mechanical stress or viral infections, which can result in abnormal wound healing response. However, the exact underlying causes and molecular mechanisms of lung fibrosis are poorly understood due to the limited availability of clinically relevant models. Recently, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 with the urgent need to investigate its pathogenesis and address drug options, has led to the broad application of in vivo and in vitro models to study lung diseases. In particular, advanced in vitro models including precision-cut lung slices (PCLS), lung organoids, 3D in vitro tissues and lung-on-chip (LOC) models have been successfully employed for drug screens. In order to gain a deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and ultimately alveolar tissue regeneration, it will be crucial to optimize the available models for SARS-CoV-2 infection in multicellular systems that recapitulate tissue regeneration and fibrotic remodeling. Current evidence for SARS-CoV-2 mediated pulmonary fibrosis and a selection of classical and novel lung models will be discussed in this review.","Kiener, M.; Roldan, N.; Machahua, C.; Sengupta, A.; Geiser, T.; Guenat, O.

Results: Of all surveys, 6.3% (n=13) reported utilizing traditional bone setting for their injury prior to presenting to KCMC. Of the self-administered surveys, 13.6% (n=6) reported utilizing bone setting compared to 4.3% (n=7) of the physician-administered surveys (p=0.050). Negative perceptions of bone setting were more common than positive perceptions and the main reason patients did not utilize bone setting was concern for competency (35.8%, n=67). Conclusion: Our study found lower bone setting utilization than expected considering the reliance of Tanzanians on traditional care reported in the literature. This suggests patients utilizing traditional care for musculoskeletal injury are not seeking allopathic care; therefore, collaboration with bone setters could expand allopathic access to these patients. Patients were less likely to report bone setter utilization to a physician revealing the stigma of seeking traditional care, which may present an obstacle for collaboration.","Card, Elizabeth B; Obayemi, Joy E; Shirima, Octavian; Rajaguru, Praveen; Massawe, Honest; Premkumar, Ajay; Sheth, Neil P",Afr Health Sci,579,24

It is estimated that at least 50% of older adults in the U.S. have pets; while pets may be a source of support, they could also pose unique challenges during an already trying time. We aimed to investigate how pets impacted the everyday lives of older adults in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A large survey of U.S. pet owners (n = 2,068) was administered to assess the impact of relationships with pets during COVID-19 on human health and well-being. We conducted bivariate analyses to compare levels of social support, loneliness, pet attachment, and family income for a subset of older adults (ages 65 and older) with a younger comparison group (ages 18-64). Using thematic and content analysis, we analyzed two open-ended prompts from age 65+ respondents (n = 122): (1) the pros and cons of living with pets during the pandemic, and (2) advice for those living with pets in future pandemics. Results: Older adults, on average, reported lower levels of social support and less loneliness than respondents below age 65. There were no significant differences in strength of attachment to pets nor income between the younger and older respondents. For the open-ended prompt regarding pros and cons, we coded three emerging themes and related sub-themes: (1) pros (company; more time together; life purpose or meaning; love; support; stress relief; routine; distraction; exercise), (2) cons (general worry; potential for illness; limited participation; veterinary care access; obtaining supplies; difficulty meeting pet needs; financial concerns), and (3) no difference. Advice shared was coded into 13 themes/sub-themes: pets' health and welfare; make plans; veterinary information; treat pets like family; don't abandon pets; human health and well-being; stay calm; enjoy pets; keep routine; be careful of transmission; seek community resources; keep supplies stocked; and finances. Conclusions: Pets may fulfill some social and emotional needs for older adults during this particularly isolating event; equally important to consider are the challenges that may be precipitated by and/or exacerbated by this public health emergency.","Applebaum, Jennifer W; Ellison, Carlyn; Struckmeyer, Linda; Zsembik, Barbara A; McDonald, Shelby E",Front Public Health,579,16

Based on the rapid increase in the rate of human infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Considering that there is no specific drug or vaccine yet for COVID-19, effective rapid diagnosis of viruses has become very important in terms of early detection and control of the outbreak. The routine difficulties of isolating the virus necessitated the diagnosis to be made with more serological tests for many years. However, in recent years, molecular tests that provide fast and high-quality viral diagnosis information have started to take their place in laboratories. Syndrome-based PCR tests after PCR and multiplex PCR tests are also approaches that question the direct factor and accelerate the diagnosis and treatment. LAMP PCR technology has also developed rapidly, and the diagnosis time has been shortened in the field or at the bedside with very small portable devices. As a new technology, CRISPR diagnostic methods and portable DNA sequencing devices will be very useful in the diagnosis of viral infections in the clinic for rapid results per patient. With immunoprecipitation systems using luciferase-labeled antigens, virus identification, quantitation, antiviral efficacy can be monitored. COVID-19 outbreak management increased the need for very fast and reliable tests and triggered the laboratory biotechnology industry. The entire world is experiencing a dynamic pandemic process in which the benefits of new, highly sensitive, accessible and portable identification methods will be tested. The presence of a large number of applications in the approval process for these methods provides strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic algorithms will have richer and productive solutions in the near future. Experiences will be guiding in better understanding of other viral infections, establishing bedside diagnostic solutions, providing more effective treatments.","Altindis, Mustafa; Feyzioǧlu, Bahadir",Gazi Med.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent PCI in England between January 2017 and April 2020 in the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society database. RESULTS: Forty-four hospitals reported PCI procedures for 126 491 patients. There were &#8776;700 procedures performed each week before the lockdown. After the March 23, 2020 lockdown (11th/12th week in 2020), there was a 49% fall in the number of PCI procedures after the 12th week in 2020. The decrease was greatest in PCI procedures performed for stable angina (66%), followed by non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (45%), and ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (33%). Patients after the lockdown were younger (64.5 versus 65.5 years, P<0.001) and less likely to have diabetes (20.4% versus 24.6%, P<0.001), hypertension (52.0% versus 56.8%, P=0.001), previous myocardial infarction (23.5% versus 26.7%, P=0.008), previous PCI (24.3% versus 28.3%, P=0.001), or previous coronary artery bypass graft (4.6% versus 7.2%, P<0.001) compared with before the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown in England has resulted in a significant decline in PCI procedures. Fewer patients underwent PCI for stable angina. This enabled greater capacity for urgent and emergency cases, and a reduced length of stay was seen for such patients. Significant changes in the characteristics of patients towards a lower risk phenotype were observed, particularly for non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, reflecting a more conservative approach to this cohort.","Kwok, Chun Shing; Gale, Chris P; Curzen, Nick; de Belder, Mark A; Ludman, Peter; Lüscher, Thomas F; Kontopantelis, Evangelos; Roebuck, Chris; Denwood, Tom; Burton, Tony; Hains, Julian; Deanfield, John E; Mamas, Mamas A",Circ Cardiovasc Interv,579,33

Complying with GMO requirements is complex, varies significantly across EU Member States and is leading to delays to clinical trials with ATMPs. Such delays and varying implementation of the GMO legislation makes the EU less attractive as a region to conduct clinical trials with investigational gene therapies. This is detrimental to EU patients, since their timely access to these transformative potentially curative medicines is delayed. Despite recent initiatives coordinated by the European Commission (EC) to facilitate and reduce discrepancies across the EU regarding the application of the GMO requirements, it remains particularly difficult to conduct multicenter clinical trials with ATMPs containing or consisting of GMOs involving several EU Member States. The recent decision for the EC to temporarily derogate potential coronavirus disease 2019 treatments and vaccines from some provisions of the GMO requirements was made on the basis of a clear recognition of such complexities and resulting delays to clinical development. The Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, and the European Association for Bioindustries call upon the EC, together with national competent authorities, to exempt ATMPs containing or consisting of GMOs from the GMO legislation. Such a simplification will eliminate the delays currently reported to occur when submitting environmental risk assessments and GMO applications to the national competent authorities. An exemption from GMO requirements will make the EU a more attractive region for clinical development of gene therapies and could accelerate European patients' access to these potentially life-saving medicines. Maintaining a system for GMO assessment that is different across countries may also prevent ATMPs from realizing the full benefits of a harmonized clinical trial approval process under the Clinical Trials Regulation. The undersigned organizations to this publication urge the EC to use its right of initiative to put forward a legislative proposal to exempt ATMPs in clinical development from the EU GMO legislation, within the timeframe proposed in the 2020 EU Pharmaceutical Strategy (by 2022). Implementation of a GMO exemption scheme before the end of the transition period for the Clinical Trial Regulation (the end of 2023) is important to avoid new Clinical Trial Application submissions for ATMPs under the Clinical Trial Regulation having to conduct the whole GMO assessment process in parallel. It is considered that ATMPs pose negligible risk to the environment. Such ATMPs include the following: human somatic cells modified ex vivo; recombinant virus-based vectors, including those containing genome editing nucleic acid sequences (which may also be delivered nonvirally); and bacterial vectors. Outside of controlled storage conditions, gene therapies cannot survive for any appreciable length of time. Upon clinical administration, any recombinant gene therapy viral vector particles that do not enter host cells are diluted within the body and if excreted are in such low multiplicity to no longer be viable or considered infectious to persons, animals, or living organisms within the environment. Any nucleic acids released into the environment are rapidly degraded.","Beattie, Stuart",Hum. gene ther,579,16

METHODS: We used data on age, ethnicity, deprivation index, pre-existing health conditions and clinical outcomes on 1,829 COVID-19 cases reported in New Zealand. We used a logistic regression model to calculate odds ratios for the risk of hospitalisation by ethnicity. We also considered length of hospital stay and risk of fatality. RESULTS: After controlling for age and pre-existing conditions, we found that Maori have 2.50 times greater odds of hospitalisation (95% CI 1.39-4.51) than non-Maori non-Pacific people. Pacific people have three times greater odds (95% CI 1.75-5.33). CONCLUSIONS: Structural inequities and systemic racism in the healthcare system mean that Maori and Pacific communities face a much greater health burden from COVID-19. Older people and those with pre-existing health conditions are also at greater risk. This should inform future policy decisions including prioritising groups for vaccination.","Steyn, N.; Binny, R.

However, patients with advanced liver disease and those after liver transplantation represent vulnerable patient cohorts with an increased risk of infection and/or a severe course of COVID-19. In addition, the current pandemic requires unusual allocation of healthcare resources which may negatively impact the care of patients with chronic liver disease that continue to require medical attention.

The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. Two authors independently screened the articles, extracted eligible ones, and assessed the quality of studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. The collected data were analyzed by the Stata software. The amount of heterogeneity was demonstrated by the I2 test.

These sites contribute to fundamental cellular processes including lipid biosynthesis, autophagy, apoptosis, ER-stress and calcium (Ca2+) signalling. At MERCS, Ca2+ ions are transferred from the ER directly to mitochondria through a core protein complex composed of inositol-1,4,5 trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R), voltage-gated anion channel 1 (VDAC1), mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and adaptor protein glucose-regulated protein 75 (Grp75); this complex is regulated by several associated proteins. Deregulation of ER-mitochondria Ca2+ transfer contributes to pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and other diseases. The efficacy of Ca2+ transfer between ER and mitochondria depends on the protein composition of MERCS, which controls ER-mitochondria interaction regulating, for example, the transversal distance between ER membrane and OMM and the extension of the longitudinal interface between ER and mitochondria. These parameters are altered in neurodegeneration. Here we overview the ER and mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis, the composition of ER-mitochondrial Ca2+ transfer machinery and alterations of the ER-mitochondria Ca2+ transfer in three major neurodegenerative diseases: motor neurone diseases, Parkinson disease and Alzheimer's disease.","Lim, Dmitry; Dematteis, Giulia; Tapella, Laura; Genazzani, Armando A; Calì, Tito; Brini, Marisa; Verkhratsky, Alexei",Cell Calcium,579,18

County-level COVID-19 cases and deaths, together with a set of potential risk factors were collected for 3050 U.S. counties during the 1st wave of COVID-19 (Mar25-Jun3, 2020), followed by similar data for 1344 counties (in the ""sunbelt"" region of the country) during the 2nd wave (Jun4-Sep2, 2020), and finally for 1055 counties located broadly in the great plains region of the country during the 3rd wave (Sep3-Nov12, 2020). We used growth mixture models to identify clusters of counties exhibiting similar COVID-19 MIR growth trajectories and risk-factors over time.

Increase thickness of TiO2 nanowires layer lowers the driving potential of the entire ECDs accompanied with reduced potential at the EC layer electrode, which further leads to decreased optical contrast and switching speed of the ECDs. Meanwhile, it can be found that the EC layer electrodes possess larger charge densities than those of TiO2 nanowire electrodes during the electrochemical redox process of these ECDs. However, the intrinsic injection and extraction charge densities of each single electrode are similar, which appears that the intrinsic charge balance of EC layer and TiO2 nanowires electrodes play more important role in the cycling stability of the ECDs.

Here, a mathematical model is proposed to simulate disease transmission among individuals in several scenarios, differing by abiotic factors, social-economic factors, and effectiveness of mitigation strategies. The disease control relies on keeping all individuals' social distancing and detecting, followed by isolating, infected ones. The model reinforces social distancing as the most efficient method to control disease transmission. Moreover, it also shows that improving the detection and isolation of infected individuals can loosen this mitigation strategy. Finally, the effectiveness of control may be different across the country, and understanding it can help set up public health strategies.","Almeida, G B; Vilches, T N; Ferreira, C P; Fortaleza, C M C B",Sci Rep,579,25

In this regard, some national and international guidelines have indicated the standards to be taken into account. However, few studies have evaluated how patients have dealt with this infection. Therefore, this study was performed with the aim to determine how the SARS-COV-2 pandemic has affected our IBD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: an online survey was performed among the members (295) of the Association of Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (ACCU), which consisted of 19 questions. Finally, it was completed by 168 patients. RESULTS: fifty-eight per cent of cases were female, 63.7 % had Crohn's disease (CD) and 53 % received biologic therapy. Five per cent were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and were male. The main concern of the patients was the fear of acquiring the infection (80.9 %). More than 90 % continued their treatments and half of the patients worked from home during the pandemic period.

Analysis of the pathological features in the lung tissues of patients who have died with COVID-19 could help us to understand the disease pathogenesis and clinical outcomes. METHODS: We systematically analysed lung tissue samples from 38 patients who died from COVID-19 in two hospitals in northern Italy between Feb 29 and March 24, 2020. The most representative areas identified at macroscopic examination were selected, and tissue blocks (median seven, range five to nine) were taken from each lung and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for at least 48 h. Tissues were assessed with use of haematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining for inflammatory infiltrate and cellular components (including staining with antibodies against CD68, CD3, CD45, CD61, TTF1, p40, and Ki-67), and electron microscopy to identify virion localisation. FINDINGS: All cases showed features of the exudative and proliferative phases of diffuse alveolar damage, which included capillary congestion (in all cases), necrosis of pneumocytes (in all cases), hyaline membranes (in 33 cases), interstitial and intra-alveolar oedema (in 37 cases), type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia (in all cases), squamous metaplasia with atypia (in 21 cases), and platelet-fibrin thrombi (in 33 cases). The inflammatory infiltrate, observed in all cases, was largely composed of macrophages in the alveolar lumina (in 24 cases) and lymphocytes in the interstitium (in 31 cases). Electron microscopy revealed that viral particles were predominantly located in the pneumocytes. INTERPRETATION: The predominant pattern of lung lesions in patients with COVID-19 patients is diffuse alveolar damage, as described in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses.

DKA is an acute complication of diabetes with a mortality rate of approximately 0.67%. Little is known about the natural history of DKA in the presence of COVID-19. This study aimed to explore the effects of COVID-19 on presentation, clinical course and outcome in patients presenting with DKA. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: All patients treated for DKA between 1 March 2020 and 30 May 2020 were included. Patients were categorised as COVID-positive or COVID-negative based on swab test. A pre-COVID group was established using data from 01 March 2019 to 30 May 2019 as external control. Data regarding demographics, diabetes type, pH, bicarbonate, lactate, glucose, DKA duration, complications and outcome were collected. RESULTS: A total of 88 DKA episodes were included in this study. There was no significant difference in the severity or duration of DKA between the three groups. COVID-positive T1DM were more hyperglycaemic on admission compared to COVID-negative and pre-COVID patients. There was an over representation of T2DM in COVID-positive patients with DKA than in pre-COVID or COVID-negative groups. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 appears to influence the natural history of DKA differently in T1DM and T2DM. Patients with T1DM and COVID-19 presented with more hyperglycaemia (60mmol/l (35.9-60.0) vs. 31.4mmol/l (28.0-39.1) vs. 24mmol/l (20.2-33.75), respectively). Patients with T2DM were unusually presenting in DKA when infected with COVID-19 with greater ICU need and higher mortality rates. A collaborative, multi-centre study is needed to provide more definitive results.","Kempegowda, Punith; Melson, Eka; Johnson, Agnes; Wallett, Lucy; Thomas, Lucretia; Zhou, Dengyi; Holmes, Catherine; Juszczak, Agata; Karamat, Mohammed Ali; Ghosh, Sandip; Hanif, Wasim; Narendran, Parth; Bellary, Srikanth",,579,16

Before the success in vaccination, this virus shows no sign of stop spreading. Nearly all the countries have implemented stringent approaches to slow down the transmission of the virus, but the virus still caused over 2 million deaths and the number is increasing. Therefore, preventing the virus spreading is still necessary to protect most people, especially the ones with pre-conditions. Mainland China has successfully eradicated the COVID-19 virus infection in Wuhan in 2020. After that, several small-scale outbreaks occurred in many cities in China, but none of these COVID-19 virus infections caused the widespread. In this review, we would like to give a detailed presentation of the approaches that were implemented by the China government to suppress the virus spreading by considering the unique characteristics of this virus and the paths of the virus transmission.

One strategy that attracted significant attention was the use of digital contact-tracing apps to quickly alert users of possible exposure to the virus, and to direct them into quarantine. The initially high expectations placed upon this strategy were not met-despite the implementation of a digital contact-tracing app in Germany, further restrictions have been placed on the general population in response to further waves of the virus. We consider how digital contact tracing might have been made more effective. Arguments: We argue that there is a conflict between collecting as little data as possible, and more effective epidemic control. In contrast to the ""Corona-Warn-App"" that was implemented in Germany, an app that stored more information on a central server (a so-called ""centralized"" app) had the potential to significantly decrease viral spread. We then look at the privacy-based arguments against the centralized storage of information, suggesting that ""decentralized"" systems have privacy problems of their own. Results: The German debate on digital contact tracing apps was quickly dominated by privacy concerns, to the detriment of other ethical factors such as enhancing potential effectiveness. Furthermore, the potential problems with privacy inherent in decentralized apps were obscured in the discussion. Once we recognize these two aspects, we can see that there is an argument to be made for preferring centralized digital contact-tracing apps.","van Basshuysen, Philippe; White, Lucie",Ethik Med,579,32

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and at the time of writing this review, just over three million individuals have been infected with more than 200,000 deaths globally. Numerous countries are in 'lockdown', social distancing is the new norm, even the most advanced healthcare systems are under pressure, and a global economic recession seems inevitable. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the aetiological agent. From experience with previous coronavirus epidemics, namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2004 and 2012 respectively, it was postulated that the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor is a possible port of cell entry. ACE2 is part of the renin-angiotensin system and is also associated with lung and cardiovascular disorders and inflammation. Recent studies have confirmed that ACE2 is the port of entry for SARS-CoV-2. Male sex, advanced age and a number of associated comorbidities have been identified as risk factors for infection with COVID-19. Many high-risk COVID-19 patients with comorbidities are on ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, and this has sparked debate about whether to continue these treatment regimes. Attention has also shifted to ACE2 being a target for future therapies or vaccines against COVID-19. In this review, we discuss COVID-19 and its complex relationship with ACE2.","Zemlin, Annalise E; Wiese, Owen J",Ann Clin Biochem,579,6

While wastewater-based epidemiology has been implemented as an alternative/additional monitoring tool to reduce reporting bias, the relationship between passive and wastewater surveillance data has not yet been explicitly examined. As there is strong age dependency in the symptomatic ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infections, here, we aimed to estimate i) an age-dependent association between the number of reported cases and viral load in wastewater and ii) the time lag between these time series. The viral load in wastewater was modeled as a combination of contributions from virus shedding by different age groups, incorporating the delay, and fitted with daily case count data collected from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater recorded by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. The estimated lag between the time series of viral loads in wastewater and of reported cases was 10.8 (95% confidence interval: 10.2-11.6) and 8.8 (8.4-9.1) days for the northern and southern areas of the wastewater treatment plant, respectively. The estimated contribution rate of a reported case to the viral load in wastewater in the 0-19 yr age group was 0.38 (0.35-0.41) and 0.40 (0.37-0.43) for the northern and southern areas, and that in the 80+ yr age group was 0.67 (0.65-0.69) and 0.51 (0.49-0.52) for the northern and southern areas, respectively. The estimated lag between these time series suggested the predictability of reported cases 10 days later using viral loads in wastewater. The contribution of a reported case in passive surveillance to the viral load in wastewater differed by age, suggesting a large variation in viral shedding kinetics among age groups.","Omori, Ryosuke; Miura, Fuminari; Kitajima, Masaaki",Sci Total Environ,579,16

Delivery of siRNA-peptide nanoplexes co-targeting MK2 and XPA to pre-existing p53-deficient tumors in a highly aggressive, immunocompetent mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma improves long-term survival and cisplatin response beyond those of the synthetic lethal p53 mutant/MK2 combination alone.

As most droplets in a common situation are immersed in external flows (such as ambient flows), we consider the effect of canonical flow profiles namely, shear flow, Poiseuille flow, and unsteady shear flow on the transport of spherical droplets of radius ranging from 5$\mu$m to 100 $\mu $m, which are characteristic lengths in human talking, coughing or sneezing processes. The dynamics we employ satisfies the Maxey-Riley (M-R) equation. An order-of-magnitude estimate allows us to solve the M-R equation to leading order analytically, and to higher order (accounting for the Boussinesq-Basset memory term) numerically. Discarding evaporation, our results to leading order indicate that the maximum travelled distance for small droplets ($5\mu m$ radius) under a shear/Poiseuille external flow with a maximum flow speed of $1m/s$ may easily reach more than 250 meters, since those droplets remain in the air for around 600 seconds. The maximum travelled distance was also calculated to leading and higher orders, and it is observed that there is a small difference between the leading and higher order results, and that it depends on the strength of the flow. For example, this difference for droplets of radius $5\mu m$ in a shear flow, and with a maximum wind speed of $5m/s$, is seen to be around $2m$. In general, higher order terms are observed to slightly enhance droplets' dispersion and their flying time.","Sandoval, Mario; Vergara, Omar",,579,1

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experience Questionnaire were used. Factors independently associated with reported symptoms of mental health disorders were identified.Measurements and Main Results: The response rate was 67%, with 1,058 respondents (median age 33 yr; 71% women; 68% nursing staff). The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation was 50.4%, 30.4%, and 32%, respectively, with the highest rates in nurses.

The objective of this study was to investigate the droplet and splatter contamination from common otologic procedures. STUDY DESIGN: Cadaver simulation series. SETTING: Dedicated surgical laboratory. METHODS: Two cadaver heads were prepped via bilateral middle cranial fossa approaches to the tegmen (n = 4). Fluorescein was instilled through a 4-mm burr hole drilled into the middle cranial fossa floor, and presence in the middle ear was confirmed via microscopic ear examination. Myringotomy with ventilation tube placement and mastoidectomy were performed, and the distribution and distance of resulting droplet splatter patterns were systematically evaluated. RESULTS: There were no fluorescein droplets or splatter contamination observed in the measured surgical field in any direction after myringotomy and insertion of ventilation tube. Gross contamination from the surgical site to 6 ft was noted after complete mastoidectomy, though, when performed in standard fashion. CONCLUSION: Our results show that there is no droplet generation during myringotomy with ventilation tube placement in an operating room setting. Mastoidectomy, however, showed gross contamination 3 to 6 ft away in all directions measured. Additionally, there was significantly more droplet and splatter generation to the left of the surgeon when measured at 1 and 3 ft as compared with all other measured directions.","Sharma, Dhruv; Rubel, Kolin E; Ye, Michael J; Campiti, Vincent J; Carroll, Aaron E; Ting, Jonathan Y; Illing, Elisa A; Burgin, Sarah J",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,579,22

The complex interactions of trace elements with the macromolecules trigger the effective immune response against the viral diseases. The outcome of various viral infections along with susceptibility is affected by trace elements such as zinc, selenium, iron, copper, etc. due to their immuno-modulatory effects. Available electronic databases have been comprehensively searched for articles published with full text available and with the key words ""Trace elements"", ""COVID-19"", ""Viral Infections"" and ""Immune Response"" (i.e. separately Zn, Se, Fe, Cu, Mn, Mo, Cr, Li, Ni, Co) appearing in the title and abstract. On the basis of available articles we have explored the role of trace elements in viral infections with special reference to COVID-19 and their interactions with the immune system. Zinc, selenium and other trace elements are vital to triggerTH1 cells and cytokine-mediated immune response for substantial production of proinflammatory cytokines. The antiviral activity of some trace elements is attributed to their inhibitory effect on viral entry, replication and other downstream processes. Trace elements having antioxidants activity not only regulate host immune responses, but also modify the viral genome. Adequate dietary intake of trace elements is essential for activation, development, differentiation and numerous functions.","Dharmalingam, Karthick; Birdi, Amandeep; Tomo, Sojit; Sreenivasulu, Karli; Charan, Jaykaran; Yadav, Dharmveer; Purohit, Purvi; Sharma, Praveen",Indian J Clin Biochem,579,33

Here, we define an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and LPS, leading to aggravated inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Native gel electrophoresis demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to LPS. Microscale thermophoresis yielded a KD of â¼47 nM for the interaction. Computational modeling and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations further substantiated the experimental results, identifying a main LPS binding site in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. S protein, when combined with low levels of LPS, boosted nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#954;B) activation in monocytic THP-1 cells and cytokine responses in human blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, respectively. The in vitro inflammatory response was further validated by employing NF-&#954;B reporter mice and in vivo bioimaging. Dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and LPS-FITC analyses demonstrated that S protein modulated the aggregation state of LPS, providing a molecular explanation for the observed boosting effect.

307777,307777,307777,Biased Belief Updating in Causal Reasoning about COVID-19 (preprint),16.54125,5.0525713,2021,"BACKGROUND: Delivering uninterrupted cancer treatment to patients with musculoskeletal tumors has been essential during the rapidly evolving coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as delays in management can be detrimental. Currently, the risk of contracting COVID-19 in hospitals when admitted for surgery and the susceptibility due to adjuvant therapies and associated mortality due to COVID-19 is unknown, but knowledge of these potential risks would help treating clinicians provide appropriate cancer care. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What is the risk of hospital-acquired COVID-19 in patients with musculoskeletal tumors admitted for surgery during the initial period of the pandemic? (2) What is the associated mortality in patients with musculoskeletal tumors who have contracted COVID-19? (3) Are patients with musculoskeletal tumors who have had neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or radiation) preoperatively at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19? (4) Is a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade in patients with musculoskeletal tumors associated with an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 when admitted to the hospital for surgery? METHODS: This retrospective, observational study analyzed patients with musculoskeletal tumors who underwent surgery in one of eight specialist centers in the United Kingdom, which included the five designated cancer centers in England, one specialist soft tissue sarcoma center, and two centers from Scotland between March 12, 2020 and May 20, 2020. A total of 347 patients were included, with a median (range) age of 53 years (10 to 94); 60% (207 of 347) were men, and the median ASA grade was II (I to IV). These patients had a median hospital stay of 8 days (0 to 53). Eighteen percent (61 of 347) of patients had received neoadjuvant therapy (8% [27] chemotherapy, 8% [28] radiation, 2% [6] chemotherapy and radiation) preoperatively. The decision to undergo surgery was made in adherence with United Kingdom National Health Service and national orthopaedic oncology guidelines, but specific data with regard to the number of patients within each category are not known. Fifty-nine percent (204 of 347) were negative in PCR testing done 48 hours before the surgical procedure; the remaining 41% (143 of 347) were treated before preoperative PCR testing was made mandatory, but these patients were asymptomatic. All patients were followed for 30 days postoperatively, and none were lost to follow-up during that period. The primary outcome of the study was contracting COVID-19 in the hospital after admission. The secondary outcome was associated mortality after contracting COVID-19 within 30 days of the surgical procedure. In addition, we assessed whether there is any association between ASA grade or neoadjuvant treatment and the chances of contracting COVID-19 in the hospital. Electronic patient record system and simple descriptive statistics were used to analyze both outcomes. RESULTS: Four percent (12 of 347) of patients contracted COVID-19 in the hospital, and 1% (4 of 347) of patients died because of COVID-19-related complications. Patients with musculoskeletal tumors who contracted COVID-19 had increased mortality compared with patients who were asymptomatic or tested negative (odds ratio 55.33 [95% CI 10.60 to 289.01]; p < 0.001).With the numbers we had, we could not show that adjuvant therapy had any association with contracting COVID-19 while in the hospital (OR 0.94 [95% CI 0.20 to 4.38]; p = 0.93). Increased ASA grade was associated with an increased likelihood of contracting COVID-19 (OR 58 [95% CI 5 to 626]; p < 0.001) CONCLUSION: Our results show that surgeons must be mindful and inform patients that those with musculoskeletal tumors are at risk of contracting COVID-19 while admitted to the hospital and some may succumb to it. Hospital administrators and governmental agencies should be aware that operations on patients with lower ASA grade appear to have lower risk and should consider restructuring service delivery to ensure that procedures are performed in designated COVID-19-restricted sites. These measures may reduce the likelihood of patients contracting the virus in the hospital, although we cannot confirm a benefit from this study. Future studies should seek to identify factors influencing these outcomes and also compare surgical complications in those patients with and without COVID-19.

Most of the deceased patients had pre-existing comorbidities; over 20% had chronic kidney disease (CKD). Furthermore, although SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized mainly by diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (AKI) has developed in a high percentage of cases. As AKI has been shown to be associated with worse prognosis, we believe that the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the kidney should be investigated. This review sets out to describe the main renal aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the role of the virus in the development and progression of kidney damage. In this article, attention is focused on the epidemiology, etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms of kidney damage, histopathology, clinical features in nephropathic patients (CKD, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, AKI, transplantation) and prevention and containment strategies. Although there remains much more to be learned with regards to this disease, nonetheless it is our hope that this review will aid in the understanding and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gagliardi, Ida; Patella, Gemma; Michael, Ashour; Serra, Raffaele; Provenzano, Michele; Andreucci, Michele",J.

Knowledge of antibody seropositivity and its duration may help dictate post-pandemic planning. Methods: Using assays to detect antibodies to either nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) proteins performed on specimens from 39,086 individuals with confirmed positive COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from March 2020 to January 2021, we analyzed nationwide seropositivity rates of IgG up to 300 days following patients' initial positive NAAT test. Linear regression identified trends in seropositivity rates and logistic regression tested positive predictability by age, sex, assay type and days post-infection. Findings: Seropositivity of IgG antibodies to both SARS-CoV-2 S and N-proteins followed a linear trend reaching approximately 90% positivity at 21 days post-index. The rate of N-protein seropositivity declined at a sharper rate, decaying to 68·2% [95% CI: 63·1-70·8%] after 293 days, while S-antibody seropositivity maintained a rate of 87·8% [95% CI: 86·3-89·1%] through 300 days. In addition to antigen type and the number of days post-positive PCR, age and gender were also significant factors in seropositivity prediction, with those under 65 years of age showing a more sustained seropositivity rate. Interpretation: Observational data from a national clinical laboratory, though limited by an epidemiological view of the U.S. population, offer an encouraging timeline for the development and sustainability of antibodies up to ten months from natural infection and could inform post-pandemic planning.","Alfego, David; Sullivan, Adam; Poirier, Brian; Williams, Jonathan; Adcock, Dorothy; Letovsky, Stanley",EClinicalMedicine,579,16

To that end, a retrospective descriptive study was undertaken in which the activity indicators of the breastmilk bank were collected and compared to data from the milk bank at Hospital Virgen de las Nieves and peripheral collaborating centers. Results: during the first state of alarm in 2020 a global reduction was seen in new donor registrations, number of donors who donated milk, donated mean volume per mother, and total volume of received and pasteurized milk. However, new registrations and number of donors who donated milk during this period increased in Granada's breastmilk bank. Discussion: the new measures adopted in the breastmilk bank in Granada, such as encouraging milk donation in mothers with admitted newborns in the Neonatal Unit, increasing information given to mothers, and home collection of donated milk, allowed to attenuate the impact of the pandemic while guaranteeing safety.","Miranda Romera, Patricia; Peña Caballero, Manuela; Martín Álvarez, Estefanía; Serrano López, Laura; Hurtado Suazo, José Antonio",Nutr Hosp,579,9

An assessment study of 175 countries worldwide,16.632576,4.769013,2021,"PURPOSE: Host genetic variants may contribute to severity of COVID-19. NKG2C+ NK cells are potent antiviral effector cells, potentially limiting the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infections. NKG2C is an activating NK cell receptor encoded by the KLRC2 gene, which binds to HLA-E on infected cells leading to NK cell activation. Heterozygous or homozygous KLRC2 deletion (KLRC2del) may naturally occur and is associated with a significantly lower or absent NKG2C expression level. In addition, HLA-E*0101/0103 genetic variants occur, caused by a single-nucleotide polymorphism. We therefore investigated whether the severity of COVID-19 is associated with these genetic variants. METHODS: We investigated the distribution of KLRC2 deletion and HLA-E*0101/0103 allelic variants in a study cohort of 361 patients with either mild (N = 92) or severe (N = 269) COVID-19. RESULTS: Especially the KLRC2del, and at a lower degree the HLA-E*0101, allele were significantly overrepresented in hospitalized patients (p = 0.0006 and p = 0.01), particularly in patients requiring intensive care (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.01), compared with patients with mild symptoms. Both genetic variants were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our data show that these genetic variants in the NKG2C/HLA-E axis have a significant impact on the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, and may help to identify patients at high-risk for severe COVID-19.","Vietzen, Hannes; Zoufaly, Alexander; Traugott, Marianna; Aberle, Judith; Aberle, Stephan W; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth",Genet. med,579,15

Many people with COVID-19 have comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, which are significantly associated with worse outcomes. Moreover, COVID-19 itself is allied with deteriorating hyperglycemia. Therefore, Bangladesh Endocrine Society has formulated some practical recommendations for management of diabetes and other endocrine diseases in patients with COVID-19 for use in both primary and specialist care settings. Objective: The objective of the article is to develop a guideline to protect the vulnerable group with utmost preference - the elderly and those with comorbid conditions. Therefore, to ensure the adequate protective measures and timely treatment for COVID-19 patients with diabetes, other endocrine diseases or any other comorbidities. Considering and Monitoring Issues: The risk of a fatal outcome from COVID-19 may be up to 50% higher in patients with diabetes than in non-diabetics.Patients with diabetes and COVID had CFR 7.3-9.2%, compared with 0.9-1.4% in patients without comorbidities.Diabetic ketoacidosis may be one of the causes of mortality in COVID-19. There is wide fluctuation of blood glucose in these patients, probably due to irregular diet, reduced exercise, increased glucocorticoids secretion, and use of glucocorticoids. HbA1c should be &lt;7.0% for the majority of the patients, this target may be relaxed in appropriate clinical settings.More emphasis should be given on day-to-day blood glucose levels. Hypoglycemia (&lt;3.9 mmol/l) must be avoided.Frequent monitoring of blood glucose is needed in critically ill patients. Conclusion: The fight against COVID-19 has been proven to be a challenging one. Therefore, all healthcare personnel should make the best use of updated knowledge and skills to ensure adequate protective measures and timely treatment for COVID-19 patients with diabetes, other endocrine diseases or any other comorbidities.","Pathan, F.; Selim, S.; Fariduddin, M.; Rahman, M.

To ensure the quality of such devices and their relevance to slow down the virus spreading, a quick reaction of the certification organisms was necessary to fix the minimal acceptable performances requirements. Moreover, many laboratories involved in the aerosol research field have been asked to perform tests in a quick time according to (CEN, 2020) proposed by the European committee for standardization. This specification imposes a minimal air permeability of 96 L m–2 s–1 for a 100 Pa pressure drop and a minimal filtration efficiency of 70% for 3 µm diameter particles. In the present article, an intercomparison of efficiencies and permeabilities measured by 3 laboratories has been performed. Results are in good agreement considering the heterogeneity of the material samples (within 27% in terms of filtration efficiency and less than 20% in terms of permeability). On this basis, an analysis of 233 materials made of woven, non-woven and mixed fibrous material has been done in terms of filtration efficiency and air permeability. For some of them, measurements have been performed for 0.2 µm, 1 µm and 3 µm particle diameters. As expected, no deterministic correlation could be determined to link these efficiencies to the permeability of the considered samples. However, a trend could be identified for woven and mixed materials with an increase of filtration efficiency when the air permeability decreases. The same exercise has been conducted to link the filtration efficiency measured at 3 µm to the one for lower diameters. Finally, a discussion on the kind of material that is the most relevant to manufacture CoFC supported by spectral filtration efficiency values (from 0.02 µm to 3 µm) is proposed.

Little is known about the epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0-16 years) with confirmed COVID-19 from electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China. We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features. FINDINGS: From Jan 17 to March 1, 2020, 36 children (mean age 8·3 [SD 3·5] years) were identified to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The route of transmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures. 19 (53%) patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]). Common symptoms on admission were fever (13 [36%]) and dry cough (seven [19%]). Of those with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 38·5°C or higher, and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 37·5-38·5°C. Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin (six [17%]). Besides radiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19 were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB. All children received interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir-ritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation. Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days. By Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured. INTERPRETATION: Although all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID-19, the large proportion of asymptomatic children indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in community-acquired infections.

The association between PM and coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has not been well established in the current literature. We sought to summarize the limited body of literature regarding PM in patients with COVID-19 and characterize the presentation and clinical outcomes of PM in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-COV-2 pneumonia at our institution to better define the incidence, prognosis, and available treatment for this condition. Materials and Methods: All patients with a proven diagnosis of COVID-19 and PM between March 18, 2020 and May 5, 2020 were identified through hospital records. Retrospective analysis of radiology records and chart review were conducted. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were collected and descriptive statistics was analyzed. Results: Thirty-six patients met inclusion criteria. Out of the 346 intubated COVID-19 patients, 34 (10%) had PM. The incidence of PM increased for the first 4 weeks of the pandemic, and then began to decrease by week 5. At the endpoint of the study, 12 (33.33%) patients were alive and 24 patients (66.67%) had died. Conclusion: PM, although a rare phenomenon, was more prevalent in COVID-19 patients compared with historical patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome. The etiology of this condition may be attributed to higher susceptibility of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to a combination of barotrauma and airway injury.","Kangas-Dick, Aaron; Gazivoda, Victor; Ibrahim, Mudathir; Sun, Arony; Shaw, Jason P; Brichkov, Igor; Wiesel, Ory","J. laparoendosc. adv. surg. tech., Part A",579,1

The clinical spectrum of MIS-C ranges from mild to severe, and even to mortal multisystem involvement. To guide clinicians, we evaluated detailed demographic characteristics, clinical features, laboratory findings, and outcomes of MIS-C cases. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with MIS-C who were managed in the Department of Pediatric Infectious Disease in the Selcuk University Faculty of Medicine, Konya, Turkey. MIS-C patients were divided into three clinical severity groups (mild, moderate, and severe) and separated into three age groups (< 5 years, 5-10 years, > 10 years). We compared the characteristics of MIS-C cases according to the severity of the disease and by age groups. RESULT: Thirty-six children with MIS-C were evaluated (52.8% male, median age of 7.8 years). A clinical spectrum overlapping with Kawasaki disease (KD) was the most common presentation (69.4%) in all age groups. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (100%), mucocutaneous rash (69.4%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (66.6%). There was no statistically significant difference in echocardiographic abnormality between KD-like and the other clinical spectra (p > 0.05). All life-threatening rhythm disturbances were observed in severe cases. No patients died. CONCLUSION: It is important to increase the awareness of physicians about the MIS-C disease, which can present with different combinations of different systemic findings, so that patients can be diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. Key Points â¢ A single tertiary centre study shows that children with MIS-C can present with different clinic spectra other than Kawasaki diseases. â¢ Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evaluation is important in early diagnosis of children with MIS-C. â¢ Pro-BNP can be used as a screening test in the emergency room for children with prolonged and unexplained fever for determine early cardiac involvement of MIS-C. â¢ The lack of require biological agents and favourable outcomes in children with MIS-C may be related with administration of steroid therapy with IVIG in early stage of disease.","Alkan, Gulsum; Sert, Ahmet; Oz, Sadiye Kubra Tuter; Emiroglu, Melike; Yilmaz, Resul",Clin. rheumatol,579,16

Currently, the treatment options for COVID-19 are limited. The purpose of the experiments presented here was to investigate the effectiveness of ketotifen, naproxen and indomethacin, alone or in combination, in reducing SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition, the cytotoxicity of the drugs was evaluated. The findings showed that the combination of ketotifen with indomethacin (SJP-002C) or naproxen both reduce viral yield. Compared to ketotifen alone (60% inhibition at EC50), an increase in percentage inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 to 79%, 83% and 93% was found when co-administered with 25, 50 and 100 µM indomethacin, respectively. Compared to ketotifen alone, an increase in percentage inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 to 68%, 68% and 92% was found when co-administered with 25, 50 and 100 µM naproxen, respectively. For both drug combinations the observations suggest an additive or synergistic effect, compared to administering the drugs alone. No cytotoxic effects were observed for the administered dosages of ketotifen, naproxen, and indomethacin.

The aim of this study was to examine health professionals' changes in their sexual lives due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Istanbul, Turkey. This online survey was conducted between 2 and 26 May 2020 with 232 healthcare professionals working in a pandemic hospital. After obtaining informed consent, a questionnaire was sent online from the hospital database and health institutions social media accounts (Twitter®, Facebook®, Instagram®, WhatsApp® etc.) and e-mail addresses. The first section of the four-part questionnaire included demographic data, the second and third sections of pre-and post-COVID-19 attitudes, and the last section to assess sexual functions (International Index of Erecile Function for male and Female Sexual Function Index for female), anxiety and depression. Dependent sample t-test, Mc Nemar test, and multivariate analysis were used.The study was completed with 185 participants in total. Healthcare workers' sexual desire (3.49 ± 1.12 vs. 3.22 ± 1.17; p = 0.003), weekly sexual intercourse/masturbation number (2.53 ± 1.12 vs. 1.32 ± 1.27; p < 0.001), foreplay time (16.38 ± 12.35 vs. 12.02 ± 12.14; p < 0.001), sexual intercourse time (24.65 ± 19.58 vs. 19.38 ± 18.85; p < 0.001) decreased compared to the Pre-COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, participants prefer less foreplay (p < 0.001), less oral sex (p < 0.001) and anal sex (p = 0.007) during COVID-19 and more non-face to face sexual intercourse positions (p < 0.001). When factors affecting sexual dysfunction were analyzed as univariate and multivariate, sexual dysfunction was shown to be significantly more common in males (OR = 0.053) and alcohol users (OR = 2.925). During the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare workers' sexual desires decreased, the number of sexual intercourses decreased, their foreplay times decreased, and their sexual intercourse positions changed to less face to face.","Culha, Mehmet Gokhan; Demir, Omer; Sahin, Orhan; Altunrende, Fatih",Int J Impot Res,579,1

METHODS: This cross-sectional study conducted between April 15, 2020, and May 5, 2020, included 6209 physicians working in KSA. An electronic questionnaire was designed and validated for the assessment of 3 categorical outcome variables, namely, attitudes, confidence, and knowledge levels. Pearson's chi-square test was used for comparing the distribution of the proportions of these 3 categorical variables. RESULTS: Most participants (63.2%) were willing and prepared to treat COVID-19 patients. A significantly large proportion of participants specializing in anesthesiology (78.2%) had higher knowledge levels, followed by those from plastic surgery (71.1%), pediatrics (69.7%), and obstetrics and gynecology (69.1%) (P < 0.0001). Lower confidence levels were found for airway management skills (38.1%), particularly among dermatologists and radiologists. CONCLUSION: Higher knowledge levels about personal protective equipment (PPE) use and confidence in airway management skills were proportionally related to the level of willingness to participate in COVID-19 patient management. There is an urgent need to train doctors from certain specialties on PPE use and airway management to enable their frontline support of severely ill COVID-19 patients.","Malaekah, Haifaa; Aljahany, Muna; Alassaf, Wajdan; Alotaibi, Malak; Alsaffar, Mashael",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,579,1

Sustained inflammation in abusers of psychostimulant drugs further induces neural damage. Cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8) is a gut-brain peptide which exerts a wide range of biological activities in the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. We previously found that pre-treatment with CCK-8 inhibited behavioural and histologic changes typically induced by repeated exposure to METH. Here, we aimed to estimate the effects of CCK-8 on METH-induced neuro-inflammation, which is markedly characterized by microglia activation and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines production in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, we assessed the subtypes of the CCK receptor mediating the regulatory effects of CCK-8, and the changes in the NF-&#954;B signalling pathway. We found that CCK-8 inhibited METH-induced microglial activation and IL-6 and TNF-&#945; generation in vivo and in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, co-treatment of CCK-8 with METH significantly attenuated the activation of the NF-&#954;B signalling pathway by activating the CCK2 receptor subtype in N9 cells. In conclusion, our findings indicated the inhibitory effect of CCK-8 on METH-induced neuro-inflammation in vivo and in vitro, and suggested the underlying mechanism may involve the activation of the CCK2 receptor, which downregulated the NF-&#954;B signalling pathway induced by METH stimulation.","Gou, Hongyan; Sun, Donglei; Hao, Lijing; An, Meiling; Xie, Bing; Cong, Bin; Ma, Chunling; Wen, Di",Neurotoxicology,579,1

To support these instructional proposals, we identify four rationales for students to understand acid-base processes: daily life, socio-scientific, curriculum, and history of science. The extensive bibliography on misconceptions at all educational levels justifies the need for a change from the usual pedagogical approaches to teaching the acid-base domain (traditionally involving conceptual-focused teaching) to a deeper and more meaningful approach that provides (implicitly or explicitly) a chance to reflect on how scientific knowledge is constructed. Controversial moments in science from 1923, when three researchers (Bronsted, Lowry, and Lewis) independently enunciated two theories from two different paradigms (dissociation and valence electron), underpin our first sequence with an explicit NoS approach for both lower secondary school and upper secondary or university levels. Our inquiry teaching cycle promotes the transformation of a hands-on activity (using cabbage as an indicator) into an inquiry, and subsequently, we use an historical model to propose a sequence of activities based on the modeling cycle of Couso and Garrido-Espeja for lower secondary school. Finally, we identify some implications for a model-focused teaching approach for upper secondary and university levels using more sophisticated models.","Jiménez-Liso, Maria Rut; López-Banet, Luisa; Dillon, Justin",Sci Educ (Dordr),579,1

The physical-chemical characterization of films, in terms of morphology, structure, thermal analysis, and optical features, suggested that thinner films with a homogenous porous structure were more likely to retain BPA molecules. The MIP films revealed the rapid and quantitative adsorption of BPA, registering the most specific binding in the first five minutes of contact with the BPA-MIP film. Silica films were effectively regenerated for further usage for at least five times, demonstrating their high stability and reusability. Even if the performance of films for BPA uptake dropped dramatically after the third adsorption/reconditioning cycle, this synthesis method for BPA-MIP films has proven to be a reliable and cheap way to prepare sensitive films with potential application for re-usable optical sensors.","Ana-Mihaela, Gavrila Ionut-Cristian Radu Stroescu Hermine Zaharia Anamaria Elena-Bianca Stoica Ana-Lorena Ciurlica Tanţa-Verona Iordache Sârbu Andrei",Applied Sciences,579,16

Spike (S) protein, one of the structural proteins of this virus plays key role in receptor (ACE2) binding and thus virus entry. Thus, this protein has attracted scientists for detailed study and therapeutic targeting. As the nCoV2019 takes its course throughout the world, more and more sequence analyses are being done and genome sequences are being deposited in various databases. From India, two clinical isolates have been sequenced and the full genome has been deposited in GenBank. We have performed sequence analyses of the Spike protein of the Indian isolates and compared with that of the Wuhan, China (where the outbreak was first reported). While all the sequences of Wuhan isolates are identical, we found point mutations in the Indian isolates. Out of the two isolates, one was found to harbor a mutation in its receptor-binding domain (RBD) at position 407. At this site, arginine (a positively charged amino acid) was replaced by isoleucine (a hydrophobic amino acid that is also a C-ß branched amino acid). This mutation has been seen to change the secondary structure of the protein at that region and this can potentially alter receptor binding of the virus. Although this finding needs further validation and more sequencing, the information might be useful in rational drug designing and vaccine engineering.","Saha, Priyanka; Banerjee, Arup Kumar; Tripathi, Prem Prakash; Srivastava, Amit Kumar; Ray, Upasana",Biosci. rep,579,24

Not only have many ecosystems already been damaged beyond natural recovery, achieving a sustainable long-term global trajectory now seem to require ever greater measures of proactionary risk-taking, in particular in relation to the growing need for climate engineering. At the same time, different optical illusions, arising from temporary emissions reductions due to the COVID-19 epidemic and the local deployment of seemingly “green” small-scale renewable energy sources, tend to obscure worsening global trends and reinforce political disinterest in developing high-energy technologies that would be more compatible with universal human development and worldwide ecological restoration. Yet, given the lack of feedback between the global and the local level, not to mention the role of culture and values in shaping perceptions of “sustainability”, the necessary learning may end up being both epistemologically and politically difficult. This paper explores the problem of finding indicators suitable for measuring progress towards meaningful climate action and the restoration of an ecologically vibrant planet.

There is an increasing need to create a model that allows particular clinics and hospitals to estimate the number of patients that require Intensive Care Units-ICU care (critical), and the number of patients that require hospital care (severe), but not ICU care, in order to manage their limited resources. This paper presents a prediction of the total number of ICU and regular beds that will be needed in Bogotá, Colombia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We use an SEIR model that includes three different categories of infection: those who can stay at home, those who need regular hospital beds, and those who need ICU treatment. The model allows for a time varying transmission rate which we use to incorporate the measures introduced by the government over the period of one semester. The model predicts that by mid November 2020, the city will need 1362 ICU beds and more than 9000 regular hospital beds. The number of active cases will be 67,866 by then and the death toll will reach 13,268 people by the end of December.

COVID-19 has posed too many challenges to health systems around the globe. This model is a useful tool for cities, hospitals and clinics in Colombia that need to be prepared for the excess demand of services that a pandemic like this one generates. Unfortunately, the model predicts that by mid-November the projected capacity of the system in Bogotá will not be enough.

The rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation requires revisions to clinical practice to defer non-essential clinical services to allocate scarce medical resources to the care of the COVID-19 patient and reduce risk to healthcare workers. Chronic pain patients require long-term multidisciplinary management even during a pandemic. Fear of abandonment, anxiety and depression may increase during this period of social isolation and aggravate pain conditions. Whilst physical consults for chronic pain patients were reduced, considerations including continuity of support and analgesia, telemedicine, allied health support and prioritising necessary pain services and interventions, were also taken to ensure biopsychosocial care for them. Chronic pain patients are mostly elderly with multiple comorbidities, and are more susceptible to morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. It is imperative to review pain management practices during the COVID-19 era with respect to infection control measures, re-allocation of healthcare resources, community collaborations, and analgesic use and pain interventions. The chronic pain patient faces a potential risk of functional and emotional decline during a pandemic, increasing healthcare burden in the long term. Clinical decisions on pain management strategies should be based on balancing the risks and benefits to the individual patient. In this commentary, we aim to discuss the basis behind some of the decisions and safeguards that were made at our tertiary pain centre over the last 6 months during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Chan, Diana Xh; Lin, Xu Feng; George, Jane Mary; Liu, Christopher W",Ann Acad Med Singap,579,27

Cities need to remake themselves from pure consumption to more resilient and circular centers, finding inspiration in their cultural and natural heritage and the history that generated it. The City of Rijeka, Croatia, one of the partners in the CLIC project (an EU-funded Horizon 2020 research project entitled “Circular models Leveraging Investments in Cultural heritage adaptive reuse”), represents an exceptional example of how to manage the change from an industrial port city to a more sustainable and citizen-oriented living space, looking at the potentials of the cultural and historical layers as opportunities for the population. The City of Rijeka, aware of such potentials, applied successfully as a European Capital of Culture 2020 (ECoC 2020), while unlikely facing the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Rijeka, thanks to the CLIC Heritage Innovative Partnership (HIP) program, the efforts to associate the circular economy and historic urban landscape benefit from an exceptional local awareness of the urban cultural and natural heritage, permitting the elaboration of the cultural corridor concept. By using the historical river of the city, the Rječina, as a connecting line of several heritage assets leading toward the Sea waterfront, the cultural corridor represents a space of culture creation based on continuity and proximity, where all citizens can securely reappropriate dismissed parts of the city, similar to the commons’ management practice. The cultural corridor has been imagined as a spatial implementation model that needs actions to be actuated. A set of actions was designed through the urban seeding process, tested in a workshop methodology, meant to address the HUL regeneration through an awareness-raising and cocreation approach by codesigning through situated learning, possible permanent or temporary actions, activities, assets to be replicated in the corridor and, per extension, in the entire city. This article will explain the way the cultural corridor concept and urban seeding were generated in the City of Rijeka, giving evidence of the motivations and the proposals made in parallel with the existing initiatives of the city and its cultural movements. © 2021 by the authors.

Telepsychiatry can provide an alternative to face-to-face assessment and can also be used creatively with other technologies to enhance care, but clinicians and patients may feel underconfident about embracing this new way of working. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to produce an open-access, easy-to-consult, and reliable source of information and guidance about telepsychiatry and COVID-19 using an evidence-based approach. METHODS: We systematically searched existing English language guidelines and websites for information on telepsychiatry in the context of COVID-19 up to and including May 2020. We used broad search criteria and included pre-COVID-19 guidelines and other digital mental health topics where relevant. We summarized the data we extracted as answers to specific clinical questions. RESULTS: Findings from this study are presented as both a short practical checklist for clinicians and detailed textboxes with a full summary of all the guidelines. The summary textboxes are also available on an open-access webpage, which is regularly updated. These findings reflected the strong evidence base for the use of telepsychiatry and included guidelines for many of the common concerns expressed by clinicians about practical implementation, technology, information governance, and safety. Guidelines across countries differ significantly, with UK guidelines more conservative and focused on practical implementation and US guidelines more expansive and detailed. Guidelines on possible combinations with other digital technologies such as apps (eg, from the US Food and Drug Administration, the National Health Service Apps Library, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) are less detailed. Several key areas were not represented. Although some special populations such as child and adolescent, and older adult, and cultural issues are specifically included, important populations such as learning disabilities, psychosis, personality disorder, and eating disorders, which may present particular challenges for telepsychiatry, are not. In addition, the initial consultation and follow-up sessions are not clearly distinguished. Finally, a hybrid model of care (combining telepsychiatry with other technologies and in-person care) is not explicitly covered by the existing guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: We produced a comprehensive synthesis of guidance answering a wide range of clinical questions in telepsychiatry. This meets the urgent need for practical information for both clinicians and health care organizations who are rapidly adapting to the pandemic and implementing remote consultation. It reflects variations across countries and can be used as a basis for organizational change in the short- and long-term. Providing easily accessible guidance is a first step but will need cultural change to implement as clinicians start to view telepsychiatry not just as a replacement but as a parallel and complementary form of delivering therapy with its own advantages and benefits as well as restrictions. A combination or hybrid approach can be the most successful approach in the new world of mental health post-COVID-19, and guidance will need to expand to encompass the use of telepsychiatry in conjunction with other in-person and digital technologies, and its use across all psychiatric disorders, not just those who are the first to access and engage with remote treatment.","Smith, Katharine; Ostinelli, Edoardo; Macdonald, Orla; Cipriani, Andrea",JMIR Ment Health,579,24

Many institutions have instituted mandatory preoperative SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasopharyngeal swab (NS) testing in patients who are low risk for COVID-19 prior to elective cases. This method, however, is challenging as the sensitivity, specificity, and overall reliability of testing remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the concordance of a negative NS in low risk preoperative patients with lower airway bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens obtained from the same patients. METHODS: We prospectively sent intraoperative lower airway BAL samples collected within 48 h of a negative mandatory preoperative NS for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. All adult patients undergoing a scheduled bronchoscopic procedure for any reason were enrolled, including elective and nonelective cases. RESULTS: One-hundred eighty-nine patients were included. All BAL specimens were negative for SARS-CoV-2 indicative of 100% concordance between testing modalities. CONCLUSIONS: These results are promising and suggest that preoperative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 testing provides adequate screening to rule out active COVID-19 infection prior to OR cases in a population characterized as low risk by negative symptom screening. This information can be used for both pre-procedural screening and when reintroducing trainees into the workforce.","Oberg, Catherine L; Ronaghi, Reza; Folch, Erik E; Channick, Colleen L; He, Tao; Susanto, Irawan; Oh, Scott S",Respiration,579,24

Here we consider adaptive designs mainly from the perspective of multi-arm Phase II clinical trials, in which one or more experimental treatments are compared to a control. Treatment allocation of individual trial participants is assumed to take place according to a fixed block randomization, albeit with an important twist: The performance of each treatment arm is assessed after every measured outcome, in terms of the posterior distribution of a corresponding model parameter. Different treatments arms are then compared to each other, according to pre-defined criteria and using the joint posterior as the basis for such assessment. If a treatment is found to be sufficiently clearly inferior to the currently best candidate, it can be closed off either temporarily or permanently from further participant accrual. The latter possibility provides a method for adaptive treatment selection, including early stopping of the trial. The main development in the paper is in terms of binary outcomes, but some extensions, notably for handling time-to-event data, are discussed as well.

Development of multifunctional agents that can inhibit Aß aggregation, rapidly disaggregate fibrils, and image aggregates is one of the effective strategies to treat and diagnose AD. Herein, the multifunctionality of nitrogen-doped carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) targeting Aß aggregation is reported. CPDs inhibit the fibrillization of Aß monomers and rapidly disintegrate Aß fibrils by electrostatic interactions, hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions with Aß in a time scale of seconds to minutes. Moreover, the interactions make CPDs label Aß fibrils and emit enhanced red fluorescence by the binding, so CPDs can be used for in vivo imaging of the amyloids in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL2006 as an AD model. Importantly, CPDs are demonstrated to scavenge the in vivo amyloid plaques and to promote the lifespan extension of CL2006 strain by alleviating the Aß-triggered toxicity.

The once-localized outbreak has since been declared a pandemic. As of April 24, 2020, there have been 2.7 million confirmed cases and nearly 200,000 deaths. Early warning systems using new technologies should be established to prevent or mitigate such events in the future. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the possibility of detecting the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in 2019 using social media. METHODS: WeChat Index is a data service that shows how frequently a specific keyword appears in posts, subscriptions, and search over the last 90 days on WeChat, the most popular Chinese social media app. We plotted daily WeChat Index results for keywords related to SARS-CoV-2 from November 17, 2019, to February 14, 2020. RESULTS: WeChat Index hits for ""Feidian"" (which means severe acute respiratory syndrome in Chinese) stayed at low levels until 16 days ahead of the local authority's outbreak announcement on December 31, 2019, when the index increased significantly. The WeChat Index values persisted at relatively high levels from December 15 to 29, 2019, and rose rapidly on December 30, 2019, the day before the announcement. The WeChat Index hits also spiked for the keywords ""SARS,"" ""coronavirus,"" ""novel coronavirus,"" ""shortness of breath,"" ""dyspnea,"" and ""diarrhea,"" but these terms were not as meaningful for the early detection of the outbreak as the term ""Feidian"". CONCLUSIONS: By using retrospective infoveillance data from the WeChat Index, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in December 2019 could have been detected about two weeks before the outbreak announcement. WeChat may offer a new approach for the early detection of disease outbreaks.","Wang, Wenjun; Wang, Yikai; Zhang, Xin; Jia, Xiaoli; Li, Yaping; Dang, Shuangsuo",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,579,8

As a result, there is a huge demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based quick disease diagnosis methods as an alternative to high demand tests such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Chest X-ray (CXR) Image analysis is such cost-effective radiography technique due to resource availability and quick screening. But, a sufficient and systematic data collection that is required by complex deep leaning (DL) models is more difficult and hence there are recent efforts that utilize transfer learning to address this issue. Still these transfer learnt models suffer from lack of generalization and increased bias to the training dataset resulting poor performance for unseen data. Limited correlation of the transferred features from the pre-trained model to a specific medical imaging domain like X-ray and overfitting on fewer data can be reasons for this circumstance. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Convolution Neural Network (GCN) that is capable of identifying bio-markers of Covid-19 pneumonia from CXR images and meta information about patients. The proposed method exploits important relational knowledge between data instances and their features using graph representation and applies convolution to learn the graph data which is not possible with conventional convolution on Euclidean domain. The results of extensive experiments of proposed model on binary (Covid vs normal) and three class (Covid, normal, other pneumonia) classification problems outperform different benchmark transfer learnt models, hence overcoming the aforementioned drawbacks.","Mudiyanselage, Thosini Bamunu; Senanayake, Nipuna; Ji, Chunyan; Pan, Yi; Zhang, Yanqing",,579,27

However, the extent to which otolaryngologists provide telemedicine services is unclear. Objective: To characterize recent trends in the use of telemedicine by otolaryngologists to deliver care to Medicare beneficiaries. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was conducted between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, using publicly available Medicare Physician/Supplier Procedure Summary data on physicians practicing in the field of otolaryngology and benchmark specialties (dermatology and psychiatry) that provided telemedicine services to Medicare beneficiaries. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were the mean annual number of telemedicine services delivered per active physician and mean annual payment per active physician for these services. Secondary outcomes included the number, setting, and complexity of telemedicine services. Results: Between 2010 and 2018, otolaryngologists provided 2127 total telemedicine services (7 unique service types) to Medicare beneficiaries and received $88â¯574 in total payment for these services. During this period, the mean number of telemedicine services increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.0%, and the mean Medicare payment per otolaryngologist increased at a CAGR of 21.8%. In comparison, telemedicine use during this period generally increased at a higher rate in the fields of dermatology (mean number of services per active physician at CAGR of 13.0%; mean Medicare payment per active physician at CAGR of 12.5%) and psychiatry (mean number of services per active physician at CAGR of 25.8%; mean Medicare payment per active physician at CAGR of 26.6%). In 2018, outpatient evaluation and management visits accounted for most telemedicine services provided (337 of 353 [95.5%]) and the payments received ($17â¯542.13 of $18â¯470.47 [95.0%]) by otolaryngologists. In contrast, physicians in other specialties also provided substantial portions of telemedicine services in the inpatient (psychiatry, 18â¯403 of 198â¯478 [9.3%]; dermatology, 231 of 1034 [22.3%]) and skilled nursing facility settings (psychiatry, 14â¯690 of 198â¯478 [7.4%]; dermatology, 46 of 1034 [4.4%]). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that the extent to which otolaryngologists used telemedicine to deliver care to Medicare beneficiaries between 2010 and 2018 was rare. Although there was relative growth in the use of telemedicine by otolaryngologists during this period, absolute growth remained low.

The severity and mortality of COVID-19 are associated with virus-induced dysfunctional inflammatory responses and cytokine storms. However, the interplay between host inflammatory responses and SARS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, the major structural protein of the virion, promotes the virus-triggered activation of NF-&#954;B signaling. After binding to viral RNA, N protein robustly undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which recruits TAK1 and IKK complex, the key kinases of NF-&#954;B signaling, to enhance NF-&#954;B activation. Moreover, 1,6-hexanediol, the inhibitor of LLPS, can attenuate the phase separation of N protein and restrict its regulatory functions in NF-&#954;B activation. These results suggest that LLPS of N protein provides a platform to induce NF-&#954;B hyper-activation, which could be a potential therapeutic target against COVID-19 severe pneumonia.","Wu, Yaoxing; Ma, Ling; Cai, Sihui; Zhuang, Zhen; Zhao, Zhiyao; Jin, Shouheng; Xie, Weihong; Zhou, Lingli; Zhang, Lei; Zhao, Jincun; Cui, Jun",Signal Transduct Target Ther,579,16

Little is known about lung cancer online support communities. This research was guided by two primary questions: (1) How do these lung cancer survivors engage in online support communities? and (2) What are the psychological, social, and physical impacts of such engagement? METHODS: Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with patients with advanced lung cancer (N = 40) to learn about their experiences with the illness. We used qualitative thematic analysis, inductive and deductive, as outlined by Carspecken. We adapted the framework for studying online communities developed by Zhang and colleagues to examine engagement with and impacts of involvement in online lung cancer support communities. RESULTS: Participants described engaging in the online community through (1) initializing communication through asking questions or sharing resources, (2) responding to others comments or inquiries, or (3) simply observing/reading others posts. Participation had physical, psychological, or social impacts, with benefits (e.g., empowerment) and risks (e.g., feelings of jealousy or misinformation) in each domain. Participants used various strategies to mitigate negative impacts, such as distancing oneself as needed. CONCLUSIONS: Online lung cancer support communities provide support, camaraderie, and specialized health information. However, there are also risks of online engagement, such as social comparison or accessing misinformation. Understanding the utility of online support communities for lung cancer survivors on targeted therapies and further addressing their risks are urgent tasks, especially in the post-COVID era.","Walsh, Casey A; Al Achkar, Morhaf",Support. care cancer,579,2

However, very few studies were conducted to analyze the general public's perception of what causes stress, anxiety, and trauma during COVID-19. This study focuses particularly on understanding Indian citizens. METHODS: By using Machine learning techniques, particularly Natural language processing, this study focuses on understanding the attitude of Indian citizens while discussing the anxiety, stress, and trauma created because of COVID-19 and the major reasons that cause it. We used Tweets as data for this study. We have used 840,000 tweets for this study. RESULTS: Our sentiment analysis study revealed the interesting fact that, even while discussing about the stress, anxiety, and trauma caused by COVID-19, most of the tweets were in neutral sentiments. Death and Lockdown caused by the COVID-19 were the two most important aspects that cause stress, anxiety, and Trauma among Indian citizens. CONCLUSION: It is important for policymakers and health professionals to understand common citizen's perspectives of what causes them stress, anxiety, and trauma to formulate policies and treat the patients. Our study shows that Indian citizens use social media to share their opinions about COVID-19 and as a coping mechanism in unprecedented time.","Praveen, S V; Ittamalla, Rajesh; Deepak, Gerard",Diabetes Metab Syndr,579,16

In this study, we aimed to investigate the demographic, clinical, and laboratory features of COVID-19 and to identify the role of mean platelet volume (MPV) in predicting the prognosis in children. A single-center retrospective study, including 251 confirmed and 65 suspected COVID-19 cases, was conducted between March 11, 2020, and December 11, 2020. In the confirmed COVID-19 group, 48 (19.1%) patients were asymptomatic, 183 (72.9%) mild, 16 (6.4%) moderate, 1 (0.4%) severe, and 3 were (1.2%) critically ill. Confirmed COVID-19 patients had significantly lower mean values of white blood cell (WBC), absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, platelet, and hemoglobin (p < .001). However, there was no significant difference in MPV levels between the two groups (p = .894). C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, fibrinogen, and NT-pro-BNP mean values were significantly lower in confirmed COVID-19 cases than suspected cases (p < .001). A total of 55 (21.9%) patients required hospitalization due to COVID-19, and MPV, WBC, CRP, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and NT-pro-BNP were statistically higher in hospitalized patients than those in outpatients. The multivariate analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the severity of disease showed that lymphopenia and higher levels of fibrinogen significantly associated with severe clinical symptoms. Decision tree analysis showed that the most powerful predictor of hospitalization due to COVID-19 was the D-dimer (p < .001). MPV values are not associated with COVID-19 disease severity. However, MPV can be used with other parameters such as WBC, CRP, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and NT-pro-BNP to predict hospitalization.","Guner Ozenen, Gizem; Sahbudak Bal, Zumrut; Umit, Zuhal; Bilen, Nimet Melis; Yildirim Arslan, Sema; Yurtseven, Ali; Saz, Eylem Ulas; Burcu, Barutcuoglu; Sertoz, Ruchan; Kurugol, Zafer; Ozkinay, Ferda",J Med Virol,579,1

We suggest why SARS-CoV-2 infection likely leads to increased methyl-group requirements and other disturbances of one-carbon metabolism. We propose these might explain the varied symptoms of long-COVID. Our suggested mechanismmight also apply to similar conditions such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. The hypothesis is evaluable by detailed determination of vitamin B12and folate status, including serum formate as well as homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, and correlation with viral and host RNA methylation and symptomatology.

TRIAL DESIGN: Randomised, parallel 3-arm (1:1:1 ratio), open-label, Phase IV platform trial of immunomodulatory therapies in patients with late stage 1 or stage 2 COVID-19-related disease, with a diagnosis based either on a positive assay or high suspicion of COVID-19 infection by clinical and/or radiological assessment. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18 and over, with a clinical picture strongly suggestive of COVID-19-related disease (with/without a positive COVID-19 test) AND a Risk count (as defined below) >3 OR &#8805;3 if risk count includes ""Radiographic severity score >3"". A risk count is calculated by the following features on admission (1 point for each): radiographic severity score >3, male gender, non-white ethnicity, diabetes, hypertension, neutrophils >8.0 x109/L, age >40 years and CRP >40 mg/L. Patients should be considered an appropriate subject for intervention with immunomodulatory therapies in the opinion of the investigator and be able to be maintained on venous thromboembolism prophylaxis during the inpatient dosing period, according to local guidelines. The complete inclusion and exclusion criteria as detailed in the additional file 1 should be fulfilled. Patients will be enrolled prior to the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, cardiac or renal support. Participants will be recruited across multiple centres including initially at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, University Hospital of Wales, Gloucestershire Royal Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Each active comparator arm will be compared against standard of care (SoC). The immunomodulatory drugs were selected from a panel of licenced candidates by a drug evaluation committee, which considered potential efficacy, potential toxicity, scalability and novelty of each strategy. The initial active arms comprise baricitinib and ravulizumab. Baricitinib will be given 4 mg orally (once daily (OD)) on days 1-14 or until day of discharge. The dose will be reduced to 2 mg OD for patients aged > 75 years and those with an estimated Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance of 30-60 ml/min. Ravulizumab will be administered intravenously once according to the licensed weight-based dosing regimen (see Additional file 1). Each active arm will be compared with standard of care alone. No comparisons will be made between active arms in this platform trial. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the incidence (from baseline up to Day 14) of any one of the events (whichever comes first): death, invasive mechanical ventilation, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation, cardiovascular organ support (inotropes or balloon pump), or renal failure (estimated Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance <15ml/min). RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be randomised using a central web-based randomisation service (Sealed Envelope) in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by site to one of the treatment arms or SoC. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label trial. Data analysis will not be blinded. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): There is no fixed sample size for this study. Serial interim analyses will be triggered by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), including analysis after 125 patients are recruited to each arm, 375 in total assuming 3 arms. Additional interim analyses are projected after 229 patients per arm, and potentially then after 469 per arm, but additional analyses may be triggered by the IDMC. TRIAL STATUS: TACTIC-R Protocol version number 2.0 date May 20, 2020, recruitment began May 7, 2020 and the end trial will be the date 18 months after the last patient's last visit.

Parallel increases have occurred in non-fatal self-harm as well. Research on suicide across the world has consistently demonstrated that suicide shares many properties with a communicable disease, including person-to-person transmission and point-source outbreaks. This essay illustrates the communicable nature of suicide through analogy to basic infectious disease principles, including evidence for transmission and vulnerability through the agent-host-environment triad. We describe how mathematical modeling, a suite of epidemiological methods, which the COVID-19 pandemic has brought into renewed focus, can and should be applied to suicide in order to understand the dynamics of transmission and to forecast emerging risk areas. We describe how new and innovative sources of data, including social media and search engine data, can be used to augment traditional suicide surveillance, as well as the opportunities and challenges for modeling suicide as a communicable disease process in an effort to guide clinical and public health suicide prevention efforts.","Keyes, Katherine M; Kandula, Sasikiran; Olfson, Mark; Gould, Madelyn S; Martínez-Alés, Gonzalo; Rutherford, Caroline; Shaman, Jeffrey",Psychol Med,579,13

Emerging research assessing then mental health implications of COVID-19 has identified an increased prevalence of depressive and anxious symptomatology among the general public. The on going second wave has led to a further deterioration of mental health. Studies also showed an increase in prevalence of psychiatric disorders among young adults and also in medical students. AIM: The aim of this study is to identify major stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and to understand their effects on college students' mental health. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Participants were recruited from the student population of our institute, Sri Lakshmi Narayana institute of medical sciences, Pondicherry. 250 medical students both undergraduate and postgraduate and students of Allied health sciences were included in this study. Pre-final, final and postgraduate students, first year students of the allied health sciences participated in the study. DATA ANALYSIS Demographic variables were expressed using Descriptive statistics. DASS 21 questionnaire items were expressed in frequencies and proportion. Chi-square test was used to test the significance. Analysis was done by using SPSS version 23. P value &lt; 0.05 will be considered as statistically significant. RESULTS Our study results showed only 3 (1.2%) in the mild depression, category, 2(0.8%) were in mild anxiety category and only 1 (0.4%) student was in mild stress. The mean DASS21 score for the 250 participants was 3.0600 (SD 1.797), indicating very few participants were in stress. Stressors and coping skills were studied, there was a statistically significant value for stigma related to COVID-19 and this combined along with stigma due to mental health could have been barriers to seeking help.","Sridhar, V.

This study aimed to examine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of trust in government regarding COVID-19 control with the adoption of recommended health behaviours and prosocial behaviours, and potential determinants of trust in government during the pandemic. METHODS: This study analysed data from the PsyCorona Survey, an international project on COVID-19 that included 23 733 participants from 23 countries (representative in age and gender distributions by country) at baseline survey and 7785 participants who also completed follow-up surveys. Specification curve analysis was used to examine concurrent associations between trust in government and self-reported behaviours. We further used structural equation model to explore potential determinants of trust in government. Multilevel linear regressions were used to examine associations between baseline trust and longitudinal behavioural changes. RESULTS: Higher trust in government regarding COVID-19 control was significantly associated with higher adoption of health behaviours (handwashing, avoiding crowded space, self-quarantine) and prosocial behaviours in specification curve analyses (median standardised ß = 0.173 and 0.229, p < 0.001). Government perceived as well organised, disseminating clear messages and knowledge on COVID-19, and perceived fairness were positively associated with trust in government (standardised ß = 0.358, 0.230, 0.056, and 0.249, p < 0.01). Higher trust at baseline survey was significantly associated with lower rate of decline in health behaviours over time (p for interaction = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results highlighted the importance of trust in government in the control of COVID-19.","Han, Qing; Zheng, Bang; Cristea, Mioara; Agostini, Maximilian; Bélanger, Jocelyn J; Gützkow, Ben; Kreienkamp, Jannis; Leander, N Pontus",Psychol Med,579,16

Communication strategies disseminate information among the population that such masks are essential for mitigating virus diffusion. However, scientific studies are not conclusive in showing the undisputed filtration efficiency of fabric/cloth facial masks (both commercial and homemade). OBJECTIVES: This study examines scientific data about the effectiveness of face masks before and during the COVID-19 emergency. Present trends in the making of commercial and homemade fabric/cloth face masks are also examined. METHODS: Statistical data of published studies are analyzed and compared. Main considerations and suggestions are also extracted and discussed. Current approaches are examined for assessing the characteristics and effectiveness of fabric/cloth commercial and homemade face masks intended for the population. RESULT: Conflicting data exist as to whether non-medical masks have a protective effect from the spread of respiratory viruses. Both medical masks (MDs) and respiratory personal protection equipment (PPE) show a given effectiveness value. CONCLUSION: Concerning commercial and homemade fabric/cloth masks, giving general indications on the choice of materials and their assemblage is difficult as it is not possible to assess the effectiveness of the filter media with respect to the kind of multiphase fluid that may be emitted upon breathing, sneezing, or coughing under different environmental conditions. This is particularly important because airflow rate, temperature, humidity, and duration of use will affect the performance of filter media. Moreover, while a mask may have excellent filter media, droplets may leak into the face-piece unless there is an adequate facial seal. In the presence of leaks, any type of mask may actually offer less protection independently of its nominal filtering effìciency.","Santarsiero, A; Giustini, M; Quadrini, F; D039,; Alessandro, D; Fara, G M",Ann. ig,579,16

We estimated the impact of the first lockdown on the burden of COVID-19 in the community in France. METHODS: Physicians participating in the French Sentinelles network reported the number of patients with an acute respiratory infection (ARI) seen in consultation and performed nasopharyngeal swabs in a sample of these patients (first patient of the week). The swabs were tested by RT-PCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and virological data were combined to estimate ARI incidence attributable to SARS-CoV-2 from 17 March to 10 May 2020. RESULTS: The incidence of ARI attributable to COVID-19 decreased after the second week of the lockdown period from 142 (95%CI [101; 183]) to 41 (95%CI [21; 60]) per 100,000 population. A decrease was observed in all areas in metropolitan France. The youngest age groups (<15-years-old) were least affected with a cumulated incidence estimated to 14 per 100,000 population during the study period.

Answering these two questions is crucial for establishing the theory for the mechanism of droplet transmission Therefore, we clarify the definition of the ""critical size"" and ""critical distance"" to distinguish between droplet transmission and airborne transmission, which vary with the composition and size of droplets, environmental factors (temperature, humidity, air velocity, etc ), and the form of air distribution Different research results may have different critical size or critical distance Subsequently, we discuss droplet evaporation and its influencing factors The evaporation of droplets is significantly decided by the relative humidity (RH) of the ambient air and the initial size of the droplets Droplet nuclei, contributing significantly to airborne transmission, usually have a particle size of less than 1 µm Their diameters are about 0 25 to 0 5 times that of the initial droplets Additionally, the droplets within critical size could completely evaporate into droplet nuclei in a low-RH air environment, or settle within a critical distance to cause droplet transmission in a high-RH environment As a result, we consider the critical size of droplets to be about 30-110 µm, and the critical distance for droplet transmission and airborne transmission to be about 2 5 m Finally, we collect some latest research on COVID-19 The size of the droplet nuclei containing SARS-CoV-2 is mainly distributed in two ranges: 0 25-0 5 and 0 5-1 µm Taking the high momentum turbulence effect of sneezing or coughing into account, the virus can be transmitted up to 7-8 m away These results are expected to be applied for understanding the opportunistic airborne transmission of COVID-19 and for the disease control and prevention in engineering and public places © 2021, Science Press All right reserved","Dai, H.; Zhao, B.",Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,579,21

On January 23rd, 2020, China issued a quarantine and travel ban on Wuhan because travelers from Wuhan were thought to account for the majority of exported COVID-19 cases to other countries. Additionally, countries evacuated their citizens from Wuhan after institution of the travel ban. Together, these two populations account for the vast majority of the ""total cases with travel history to China"" as designated by the World Health Organization (WHO). The current study aims to assess the prevalence and risk of COVID-19 among international travelers and evacuees of Wuhan. We first used case reports from Japan, Singapore, and Korea to investigate the date of flights of infected travelers. We then used airline traveler data and the number of infected exported cases to correlate the cases with the number of travelers for multiple countries. Our findings suggest that the risk of COVID-19 infection is highest among Wuhan travelers between January 19th and 22nd, 2020, with an approximate infection rate of up to 1.3% among international travelers. We also observed that evacuee infection rates varied heavily between countries and propose that the timing of the evacuation and COVID-19 testing of asymptomatic evacuees played significant roles in the infection rates among evacuees. These findings suggest COVID-19 cases and infectivity are much higher than previous estimates, including numbers from the WHO and the literature, and that some estimates of the infectivity of COVID-19 may need re-assessment.","Luo, George; McHenry, Michael L; Letterio, John J",PLoS One,579,16

METHODS: A 41-question survey was distributed from June to September 2020 to members of the Society of Breast Imaging and the National Consortium of Breast Centers. Psychological distress and financial loss scores were calculated on the basis of survey responses and compared across gender and age subgroups. A multivariate logistic model was used to identify factors associated with psychological distress scores. RESULTS: A total of 628 surveys were completed (18% response rate); the mean respondent age was 52 ± 10 years, and 79% were women. Anxiety was reported by 68% of respondents, followed by sadness (41%), sleep problems (36%), anger (25%), and depression (23%). A higher psychological distress score correlated with female gender (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; P = .001), younger age (OR, 0.8 per SD; P = .005), and a higher financial loss score (OR, 1.4; P < .0001). Participants whose practices had not initiated wellness efforts specific to COVID-19 (54%) had higher psychological distress scores (OR, 1.4; P = .03). Of those with children at home, 38% reported increased childcare needs, higher in women than men (40% versus 29%, P < .001). Thirty-seven percent reported that childcare needs had adversely affected their jobs, which correlated with higher psychological distress scores (OR, 2.2-3.3; P < .05).

MATERIAL AND METHOD: All patient records from the Psychiatric Casualty Clinic in Oslo from and including 13 March 2020 up to and including 1 April 2020 were compared with the patient records from the same period in 2019. Patient visits were registered as COVID-19-related when the patient came to the clinic for an issue linked to the pandemic. RESULTS: The Psychiatric Casualty Clinic in Oslo had 105 patient visits in the period 13 March 2019-1 April 2019 and 63 in the same period for 2020 (-40 %). The number of admissions amounted to 16 in 2019 and 7 in 2020 (-56 %). The number of COVID-19-related consultations was 14/63 (22 %). There was a reduction in the number of patient visits for crisis reactions, from 28 in 2019 to 8 in 2020. INTERPRETATION: The background for the decline in the flow of patients in the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic is most likely a complex one. We believe that patients primarily chose not to visit the clinic due to the risk of infection and the wish to avoid burdening the health services. With the reservation that our data are limited, it does not appear that increased access to psychiatric health services requiring physical attendance is indicated in the acute phase of a pandemic.","Ness, Ewa; Salvador, Erik Myrvang; Gardsjord, Erlend Strand",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,579,16

Personal health records (PHRs) are suitable for the daily management of physical conditions. Importantly, there are no major differences between the items collected by daily health observation via PHR and the observation of items related to COVID-19. Until now, observations related to COVID-19 have been performed exclusively based on disease-specific items. Therefore, we hypothesize that PHRs would be suitable as a symptom-tracking tool for COVID-19. To this end, we integrated health observation items specific to COVID-19 with an existing PHR-based app. OBJECTIVE: This study is conducted as a proof-of-concept study in a real-world setting to develop a PHR-based COVID-19 symptom-tracking app and to demonstrate the practical use of health observations for COVID-19 using a smartphone or tablet app integrated with PHRs. METHODS: We applied the PHR-based health observation app within an active epidemiological investigation conducted by Wakayama City Public Health Center. At the public health center, a list is made of individuals who have been in close contact with known infected cases (health observers). Email addresses are used by the app when a health observer sends data to the public health center. Each health observer downloads the app and installs it on their smartphone. Self-observed health data are entered daily into the app. These data are then sent via the app by email at a designated time. Localized epidemiological officers can visualize the collected data using a spreadsheet macro and, thus, monitor the health condition of all health observers. RESULTS: We used the app as part of an active epidemiological investigation executed at a public health center. During the investigation, 72 close contacts were discovered. Among them, 57 had adopted the use of the health observation app. Before the introduction of the app, all health observers would have been interviewed by telephone, a slow process that took four epidemiological officers more than 2 hours. After the introduction of the app, a single epidemiological officer can carry out health observations. The app was distributed for free beginning in early March, and by mid-May, it had been used by more than 20,280 users and 400 facilities and organizations across Japan. Currently, health observation of COVID-19 is socially recognized and has become one of the requirements for resuming social activities. CONCLUSIONS: Health observation by PHRs for the purpose of improving health management can also be effectively applied as a measure against large-scale infectious diseases. Individual habits of improving awareness of personal health and the use of PHRs for daily health management are powerful armaments against the rapid spread of infectious diseases. Ultimately, similar actions may help to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","Yamamoto, Keiichi; Takahashi, Tsubasa; Urasaki, Miwa; Nagayasu, Yoichi; Shimamoto, Tomonari; Tateyama, Yukiko; Matsuzaki, Keiichi; Kobayashi, Daisuke; Kubo, Satoshi; Mito, Shigeyuki; Abe, Tatsuya; Matsuura, Hideo; Iwami, Taku",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,579,1

The host immunity of COVID-19 patients is unknown.METHODSThe routine laboratory tests and host immunity in COVID-19 patients with different severity of illness were compared after patient admission.RESULTSA total of 65 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were classified as having mild (n = 30), severe (n = 20), and extremely severe (n = 15) illness. Many routine laboratory tests, such as ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer, were increased in severe and extremely severe patients. The absolute numbers of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells were gradually decreased with increased severity of illness. The activation markers such as HLA-DR and CD45RO expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were increased in severe and extremely severe patients compared with mild patients. The costimulatory molecule CD28 had opposite results. The percentage of natural Tregs was decreased in extremely severe patients. The percentage of IFN-Î³-producing CD8+ T cells was increased in both severe and extremely severe patients compared with mild patients. The percentage of IFN-Î³-producing CD4+ T cells was increased in extremely severe patients. IL-2R, IL-6, and IL-10 were all increased in extremely severe patients. The activation of DC and B cells was decreased in extremely severe patients.CONCLUSIONThe number and function of T cells are inconsistent in COVID-19 patients. The hyperfunction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is associated with the pathogenesis of extremely severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.FUNDINGThis work was funded by the National Mega Project on Major Infectious Disease Prevention (2017ZX10103005-007) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2019kfyRCPY098).","Wang, Feng; Hou, Hongyan; Luo, Ying; Tang, Guoxing; Wu, Shiji; Huang, Min; Liu, Weiyong; Zhu, Yaowu; Lin, Qun; Mao, Liyan; Fang, Minghao; Zhang, Huilan; Sun, Ziyong",JCI insight,579,25

DESIGN: National survey. SETTING: UK maternity services during the COVID-19 pandemic. POPULATION OR SAMPLE: Healthcare professionals working within maternity services. METHODS: A national electronic survey was developed to investigate local modifications to general and specialist maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the context of the contemporaneous national pandemic guidance. After a pilot phase, the survey was distributed through professional networks by the RCOG and co-authors. The survey results were presented descriptively in tabular and graphic formats, with proportions compared using chi-square tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Service modifications made during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 81 respondent sites, 42% of the 194 obstetric units in the UK, were included. They reported substantial and heterogeneous maternity service modifications. Seventy percent of units reported a reduction in antenatal appointments and 56% reported a reduction in postnatal appointments; 89% reported using remote consultation methods. A change to screening pathways for gestational diabetes mellitus was reported by 70%, and 59% had temporarily removed the offer of births at home or in a midwife-led unit. A reduction in emergency antenatal presentations was experienced by 86% of units. CONCLUSIONS: This national survey documents the extensive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternity services in the UK. More research is needed to understand the impact on maternity outcomes and experience.

représentent une population vulnérable qui a été sous-étudiée dans le cadre de la recherche COVID-19 Nous avons cherché à établir si les résultats et les soins de santé différaient entre les patients atteints de schizophrénie et les patients sans diagnostic de maladie mentale Nous avons mené une étude basée sur la population de tous les patients présentant des symptômes respiratoires et une infection à COVID-19 identifiés qui ont été hospitalisés en France entre février et juin 2020 Au total, 50 750 patients ont été inclus, dont 823 étaient des patients avec schizophrénie (1,6 %) Ces derniers ont connu une augmentation de la mortalité hospitalière (25,6 % contre 21,7 % pour les autres patients) et une diminution du taux d'admission en unité de soins intensifs- réanimation (23,7 % contre 28,4 %) par rapport aux témoins Les patients schizophrènes âgés de 65 à 80 ans présentaient un risque de mortalité significativement plus élevé que les témoins du même âge (+7,89 %) alors qu'ils ont été moins admis en USI que les témoins du même âge (-15,44 %) Cette étude montre l'existence de disparités en matière de santé et d'accès aux soins entre les patients schizophrènes et les patients sans diagnostic de maladie mentale Ces disparités diffèrent en fonction de l'âge et du profil clinique des patients, ce qui suggère l'importance d'une gestion clinique personnalisée du COVID-19 et de stratégies de soins de santé avant, pendant et après l'hospitalisation pour réduire les disparités de santé dans cette population vulnérable Les patients schizophrènes âgés de 65 à 80 ans étaient plus souvent envoyés par les hôpitaux ou les institutions que les patients sans diagnostic de maladie mentale grave, ce qui peut expliquer les mauvais résultats de santé des patients schizophrènes Une étude française a rapporté que la plupart des patients psychiatriques hospitalisés avec un diagnostic COVID-19 étaient gardés dans des services psychiatriques spécialisés et non dans des hôpitaux généraux La division entre médecine physique et psychiatrique entraîne une confusion quant au secteur du service de santé (c'est-à-dire les niveaux de soins primaires, de santé mentale ou de soins aigus) qui devrait assumer la responsabilité de la gestion des patients ayant des besoins de santé complexes Nous manquons de données nationales sur le taux de patients âgés schizophrènes qui sont institutionnalisés, mais nous pouvons raisonnablement supposer que l'institutionnalisation est un facteur de risque d'infection grave par COVID-19 chez les patients âgés avec schizophrénie Nos résultats soutiennent une stratégie de détection systématique chez les patients avec schizophrénie institutionnalisés et d'intervention précoce dans cette population Cela a déjà été fait dans un refuge pour sans-abri à Boston où 36 % des résidents ont été testés positifs Le taux d'admission en réanimation était plus faible chez les patients schizophrènes que chez les patients sans diagnostic de maladie mentale grave, ce qui illustre parfaitement le débat entre les arguments fondés sur l'utilité et ceux fondés sur l'équité Les patients schizophrènes présentaient l'un des plus mauvais indicateurs de pronostic justifiant le triage en réanimation Cependant, ce triage basé uniquement sur le pronostic exacerbe les inégalités existantes en matière de santé, laissant les patients défavorisés dans une situation plus difficile Patients with schizophrenia represent a vulnerable population who have been understudied in COVID-19 research We aimed to establish whether health outcomes and care differed between patients with schizophrenia and patients without a diagnosis of severe mental illness We conducted a population-based cohort study of all patients with identified COVID-19 and respiratory symptoms who were hospitalized in France between February and June 2020 Cases were patients who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia Controls were patients who did not have a diagnosis of severe mental illness The outcomes were in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission A total of 50,750 patients were included, of whom 823 were schizophrenia patients (1 6%) The schizophrenia patients had an increased in-hospital mortality (25 6% vs 21 7%;adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1 30 [95% CI 1 08-1 56], p=0 0093) and a decreased ICU admission rate (23 7% vs 28 4%;aOR 0 75 [95% CI 0 62-0 91], p=0 0062) compared to controls Significant interactions between schizophrenia and age for mortality and ICU admission were observed (p=0 0006 and p&lt;0 0001) schizophrenia patients between 65 and 80 years had a significantly higher risk of death than controls of the same age (+7 89%) schizophrenia patients younger than 55 years had more ICU admissions (+13 93%) and schizophrenia patients between 65 and 80 years and older than 80 years had less ICU admissions than controls of the same age (-15 44% and-5 93%, respectively) Our findings report the existence of disparities in health and health care between schizophrenia patients and patients without a diagnosis of severe mental illness These disparities differed according to the age and clinical profile of schizophrenia patients, suggesting the importance of personalized COVID-19 clinical management and health care strategies before, during and after hospitalization for reducing health

Individuals in the USA and the UK are self-isolating in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Different motivations may drive their self-isolation: some might see value in it (understood as the identified form of autonomous motivation), while others might feel forced into it by authorities or close others (family, friends, neighbourhoods, doctors; the external form of controlled motivation). People who typically prefer company will find themselves spending more time alone, and may experience ill-being uniformly, or as a function of their identified or external motivations for self-isolation. Self-isolation, therefore, offers a unique opportunity to distinguish two constructs coming from disparate literatures. This project examined preference and motivation (identified and external) for solitude, and tested their independent and interacting contributions to ill-being (loneliness, depression and anxiety during the time spent alone) across two weeks. Confirmatory hypotheses regarding preference and motivation were not supported by the data. A statistically significant effect of controlled motivation on change in ill-being was observed one week later, and preference predicted ill-being across two weeks. However, effect sizes for both were below our minimum threshold of interest.","Weinstein, Netta; Nguyen, Thuy-Vy",R. Soc. Open Sci.,579,24

In this context, drone delivery systems are of great interest as they may allow for faster and cheaper deliveries. This paper presents a navigation system that makes feasible the delivery of parcels with autonomous drones. The system generates a path between a start and a final point and controls the drone to follow this path based on its localization obtained through GPS, 9DoF IMU, and barometer. In the landing phase, information of poses estimated by a marker (ArUco) detection technique using a camera, ultra-wideband (UWB) devices, and the drone's software estimation are merged by utilizing an Extended Kalman Filter algorithm to improve the landing precision. A vector field-based method controls the drone to follow the desired path smoothly, reducing vibrations or harsh movements that could harm the transported parcel. Real experiments validate the delivery strategy and allow to evaluate the performance of the adopted techniques. Preliminary results state the viability of our proposal for autonomous drone delivery.","Miranda, Victor R. F.; Rezende, Adriano M. C.; Rocha, Thiago L.; Azp'urua, H'ector; Pimenta, Luciano C.

The identification and designing of appropriate and reliable drug molecule for the treatment of COVID-19 patients is the pressing need of the present time. Among different drug targets, the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is being considered as most effective target. In addition to the drug repurposing, different compounds of natural as well as synthetic origins are being investigated for their efficacy against different drug targets of SARS-CoV-2 virus. In that context, the chromone based natural flavonols have also exhibited significant antiviral properties against different targets of SARS-CoV-2. The in silico studies presented here discloses the efficacy of triarylchromones (TAC) as potential inhibitor against main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular docking and ADMET study performed using 14 arylchromones which could easily be accessed through simple synthetic protocols, revealed best binding affinities in case of TAC-3 (-11.2 kcal/mol), TAC-4 (-10.5 kcal/mol), TAC-6 (-11.2 kcal/mol), TAC-7 (-10.0 kcal/mol). Additional validation studies including molecular dynamics simulation and binding energy calculation using MMGBSA for protein ligand complex for 100 ns revealed the best binding interaction of TAC-3, TAC-4, TAC-6, TAC-7 against main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the in vitro and preclinical validation of identified compounds will help us to understand the molecular mechanisms of regulation of TACs against SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

It implies a shift of endowment in financial markets, and its effects on economic inequality, financial deepening and total economic income. Theoretical models are proposed, where the public sector seeks alternatives to a lockdown, allowing self-regulation of the economy, taxing capital or seeking joint policies with other states. In the first model, the economy is self-regulating with the help of the financial sector. Nonetheless, inequality is generated and in other models, the public sector tries to intervene. First, the public sector minimizes inequality by taxing capital, allowing a redistribution of wealth and income, with a tax rate that depends only on the differential impacts of the black swan on the different markets. Finally, a coordination of policies between the different countries affected is proposed to prevent black swans and other negative externalities.

AIM: To investigate the changes in sexual life and sexual function of Chinese men during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: An online questionnaire was created and the survey was administered through social media to Chinese adult men. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main end point was the deteriorated erectile function or ejaculatory control ability, defined by self-evaluation or by decreased International Index of Erectile Function-5 items (IIEF-5) scores or increased premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT) scores. RESULTS: Altogether, 612 questionnaires were collected. About 322 (52.6%) subjects were unmarried. About 8.4% and 8.5% subjects reported deteriorated erectile function or ejaculation control ability by self-evaluation, whereas 31.9% and 17.9% subjects showed decreased IIEF-5 scores or increased PEDT scores. Subjects with deteriorated erectile function by self-evaluation and decreased IIEF-5 scores had higher General Anxiety Disorder-7 (P < .001 and P = .001) and higher Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (P < .001 and P = .002) after the epidemic, decreased frequency of sexual life (P < .001 and P < .001) and physical exercise (P = .009 and .007) after the epidemic. Subjects with deteriorated ejaculation control ability by self-evaluation and increased PEDT scores had higher General Anxiety Disorder-7 (P < .001 and P < .001) and higher Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (P < .001 and P = .002) after the epidemic. Subjects with decreased frequency of sexual life had reduced income (P < .001), increased anxiety (P < .001) and depression (P < .001). Married subjects had higher proportion of improved depression (P = .048) and increased frequency of sexual life (P = .010). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 epidemic, decreased sexual function was present in a certain proportion of adult men, and the risk factors include increased anxiety and depression, and decreased frequency of sexual life.

The VTE risk appears highest in those with critical care admission. The need for postdischarge thromboprophylaxis remains controversial, which is reflected in conflicting expert guideline recommendations. Our local protocol provides thromboprophylaxis to COVID-19 patients during admission only. We report postdischarge VTE data from an ongoing quality improvement program incorporating root-cause analysis of hospital-associated VTE (HA-VTE). Following 1877 hospital discharges associated with COVID-19, 9 episodes of HA-VTE were diagnosed within 42 days, giving a postdischarge rate of 4.8 per 1000 discharges. Over 2019, following 18 159 discharges associated with a medical admission; there were 56 episodes of HA-VTE within 42 days (3.1 per 1000 discharges). The odds ratio for postdischarge HA-VTE associated with COVID-19 compared with 2019 was 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-3.1). COVID-19 hospitalization does not appear to increase the risk of postdischarge HA-VTE compared with hospitalization with other acute medical illness. Given that the risk-benefit ratio of postdischarge thromboprophylaxis remains uncertain, randomized controlled trials to evaluate the role of continuing thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 patients following hospital discharge are required.","Roberts, Lara N; Whyte, Martin B; Georgiou, Loizos; Giron, Gerard; Czuprynska, Julia; Rea, Catherine; Vadher, Bipin; Patel, Raj K; Gee, Emma; Arya, Roopen",Blood,579,9

We aimed to assess the health, psychosocial and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with chronic conditions in India. METHODS: Between July 29, to September 12, 2020, we telephonically surveyed adults (n = 2335) with chronic conditions across four sites in India. Data on participants' demographic, socio-economic status, comorbidities, access to health care, treatment satisfaction, self-care behaviors, employment, and income were collected using pre-tested questionnaires. We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to examine the factors associated with difficulty in accessing medicines and worsening of diabetes or hypertension symptoms. Further, a diverse sample of 40 participants completed qualitative interviews that focused on eliciting patient's experiences during the COVID-19 lockdowns and data analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred thirty-four individuals completed the survey (response rate = 74%). The mean (SD) age of respondents was 57.8 years (11.3) and 50% were men. During the COVID-19 lockdowns in India, 83% of participants reported difficulty in accessing healthcare, 17% faced difficulties in accessing medicines, 59% reported loss of income, 38% lost jobs, and 28% reduced fruit and vegetable consumption. In the final-adjusted regression model, rural residence (OR, 95%CI: 4.01,2.90-5.53), having diabetes (2.42, 1.81-3.25) and hypertension (1.70,1.27-2.27), and loss of income (2.30,1.62-3.26) were significantly associated with difficulty in accessing medicines. Further, difficulties in accessing medicines (3.67,2.52-5.35), and job loss (1.90,1.25-2.89) were associated with worsening of diabetes or hypertension symptoms. Qualitative data suggest most participants experienced psychosocial distress due to loss of job or income and had difficulties in accessing in-patient services.

The population was generally susceptible. However, reports on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were very limited. By sharing the clinical characteristics, treatments and outcomes of 18 patients with COVID-19 during late pregnancy, we hope to provide some references for obstetric treatment and management. METHODS: A total of 18 patients with COVID-19 treated at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were collected. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, chest CT and pregnancy outcomes were performed for analysis. RESULTS: 1. 18 cases of late pregnancy infected with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were delivered at 35 + 5 weeks to 41 weeks. According to the clinical classification of COVID-19, 1 case was mild type, 16 cases were ordinary type, and 1 case was severe type. 2. According to imaging examinations: 15 (83%) cases showed unilateral or bilateral pneumonia, 2 (11%) cases had pulmonary infection with pleural effusion, and 1 (6%) case had no abnormal imaging changes. 8 (44%) cases were positive and 10 (56%) cases were negative for nasopharyngeal-swab tests of SARS-CoV-2. 3. Among the 18 newborns, there were 3 (17%) premature infants, 1 (6%) case of mild asphyxia, 5 (28%) cases of bacterial pneumonia, 1 (6%) case of gastrointestinal bleeding, 1 (6%) case of necrotizing enteritis, 2 (11%) cases of hyperbilirubinemia and 1 (6%) case of diarrhea. All the newborns were negative for the first throat swab test of SARS-CoV-2 after birth. 4. Follow-up to Mar 7, 2020, no maternal and neonatal deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients in late term pregnancy with COVID-19 were of ordinary type, and they were less likely to develop into critical pneumonia after early isolation and antiviral treatment. Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not detected, but the proportion of neonatal bacterial pneumonia was higher than other neonatal diseases in newborns.","Zhang, Lu; Dong, Lan; Ming, Lei; Wei, Min; Li, Jun; Hu, Ruheng; Yang, Jing",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,579,20

Digital phenotyping helps promote the compliance with these policies through the personalized behavioral knowledge it produces. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the value of smartphone-derived digital phenotypes in (1) analyzing individuals' compliance with COVID-19 policies through behavioral responses and (2) suggesting ways to personalize communication through those policies. METHODS: We conducted longitudinal experiments that started before the outbreak of COVID-19 and continued during the pandemic. A total of 16 participants were recruited before the pandemic, and a smartphone sensing app was installed for each of them. We then assessed individual compliance with COVID-19 policies and their impact on habitual behaviors. RESULTS: Our results show a significant change in people's mobility (P<.001) as a result of COVID-19 regulations, from an average of 10 visited places every week to approximately 2 places a week. We also discussed our results within the context of nudges used by the National Health Service in the United Kingdom to promote COVID-19 regulations. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that digital phenotyping has substantial value in understanding people's behavior during a pandemic.

Unfortunately, information regarding the immunological characteristics of COVID-19 patients remains limited. Herein, we collected blood samples from 18 healthy donors (HDs) and 38 COVID-19 patients to analyse changes in the adaptive immune cell populations and their phenotypes. We observed that the lymphocyte percentage moderately decreased, CD4 and CD8 T cell percentage among lymphocytes were similar, and B cell percentage was increased in COVID-19 patients in comparison to that in HDs. T cells, especially CD8 T cells, showed an enhanced expression of late activation marker CD25 and exhaustion marker PD-1. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection increased the percentage of T follicular helper- and germinal centre B-like cells in the blood. The parameters in COVID-19 patients remained unchanged across various age groups. Therefore, we demonstrated that the T and B cells are activated naturally and are functional during SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data provide evidence that the adaptive immunity in most patients could be primed to induce a significant immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection upon receiving standard medical care.","Yang, Xiaofang; Dai, Tongxin; Zhou, Xiaobo; Qian, Hongbo; Guo, Rui; Lei, Lei; Zhang, Xingzhe; Zhang, Dan; Shi, Lin; Cheng, Yanbin; Hu, Jinsong; Guo, Yaling; Zhang, Baojun",J Cell Mol Med,579,1

However, vaccine hesitancy is increasingly becoming a global problem. One prevalent misconception is that influenza vaccinations can cause the flu. We carried out this study to determine whether people undertaking influenza vaccination presented less with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) and influenza-like-illness (ILI) following vaccination. We utilised the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre sentinel database to examine English patients who received vaccination between 2014/2015 and 2018/2019. Of the 3,841,700 influenza vaccinations identified, vaccination details and primary care respiratory consultation counts were extracted to calculate the relative incidence (RI) per exposure risk period using the self-controlled case series methodology. Results showed a significant increase in the RI of respiratory consultation rates within fourteen days of vaccination across all five years. Less than 6.2% of vaccinations led to consultations for ARTI or ILI in primary care (crude consultation rate 6196 per 100,000). These findings, particularly if confirmed in further research, may reduce the risk of cross-infection between waiting patients and increase uptake of influenza vaccine.","Parimalanathan, Vaishnavi; Joy, Mark; Van Dam, Pieter Jan; Fan, Xuejuan; de Lusignan, Simon",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),579,16

In humans, the most common symptoms of the infection include fever and difficulty in breathing. In order to reduce the diffusion of the current “Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)” pandemic, the Internet of Things technologies can play an important role; for instance, they can be effectively used for implementing a real-time patient tracking and warning system at a city scale. Crucial places to install the tracking IoT devices are the public/private vehicles that, augmented with multiple connectivity solutions, can implement the Internet of Vehicles paradigm. In such ubiquitous network environment, vehicles are equipped with a variety of sensors, including regular cameras that can be replaced with thermal cameras. Therefore, this article proposes a new design for widely detecting respiratory viral diseases that leverages IoV to collect real-time body temperature and breathing rate measurements of pedestrians. This information can be used to recognize geographic areas affected by possible COVID-19 cases and to implement proactive preventive strategies that would further limit the spread of the disease.","Sahraoui, Yesin; Korichi, Ahmed; Kerrache, Chaker Abdelaziz; Bilal, Muhammad; Amadeo, Marica",Trans. emerg. telecommun. technol.,579,5

This study aimed to enrich the literature by critically analyzing the clinical and biological characteristics of 134 patients from the North African Mediterranean region, including numerous genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors that may influence disease evolution. This single-center retrospective study included all patients older than 18 years confirmed to have COVID-19 and hospitalized at the Cheikh Khalifa University Hospital affiliated with Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences, Casablanca, Morocco. Clinical, demographic, and biological data were analyzed in a cohort of severe and non-severe patients. Univariate analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of severity. There were 134 patients: the median age was 53 years, and 54.5% were male. Of these, 89 had mild to moderate disease; 45 had severe to critical disease, of which 14 died and 31 survived. Advanced age, presence of comorbidities, male sex, and infection in ethnic or family groups were risk factors for progression to severe disease. The presence of abnormalities in the following parameters were strongly associated with progression to severe disease: white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), and alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) during both admission and hospitalization.

In this manuscript, we report our previsions, strategies implemented, and the outcomes obtained. RESULTS: Three-thousand and thirty-three patients were admitted to the HUVH Critical Care Units. Throughout the study period, the proportion of patients on IMV or IMV and ECMO remained above 78%. Most patients were men (65%); the most common age group was 60-70 years. Twenty-three patients received ECMO, and eighteen were cannulated at another center and transferred to HUVH. At the end of the study, fourteen patients were successfully decannulated, three patients died, and the rest of the patients were still on ECMO. Eight pregnant women have been treated in the ICU, with a survival rate of 100%. The ICU mortality of patients younger than 60 years was 3.2%.

Structural equation modeling of the impact of bank lending on the performance of enterprises in the real sector is carried out using Ukraine as an example. Six key indicators of real sector enterprises' performance for the period of 2007-2019 were selected as an information basis of the study. To assess the abovementioned impact, structural equation modeling was used, i.e., the Statistica program was selected as a software tool to evaluate the resulting model's adequacy and determine the level of statistical significance of its parameters. The obtained results prove that the business lending sector in Ukraine has significant potential for its development, which ultimately will have a positive effect on the efficiency of the real sector enterprises.

At the last cut-off point of the study only 30/87 ENT Departments (34.5%) remained COVID19-free and 5 Departments reported more than 50% staff members testing positive. The majority of positive tested otolaryngologists (126/157; 80.2%) had only mild or no symptoms, 17 developed moderate symptoms (10.8%) and 3 had pneumonia not requiring hospitalization (2%). Five colleagues were admitted at hospital, 4 required ICU (2.5%) and 2 colleges died from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic otolaryngologists in Spain have been overall the group suffering the highest rate of contagion, particularly during the first month. Subsequently, the Spanish Ministry of Health should include otorhinolaryngologists as a high-risk group in airborne pandemics.","Martin-Villares, Cristina; Bernal-Sprekelsen, Manuel; Molina-Ramirez, Carmen Perez; Bartolome-Benito, Margarita",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,579,1

Since the first case of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed in South Korea on January 20, the number of COVID-19 cases in South Korea has been rapidly increasing until early March due to a local spread in Daegu, which is one of the eight metropolitan cities in South Korea with a population of 2.5 million. As the medical academy has social accountability as professionals, Daegu-Gyeongbuk branch of the Korean Academy of Family Medicine (Daegu-Gyeongbuk branch) developed the health counseling program for discharged COVID-19 patients. The Daegu-Gyeongbuk branch communicated with Daegu Medical Association and Daegu city for this program and incorporated available resources and capabilities as a leader of this program. This newly developed counseling program consists of medical consultations, sending healthcare brochures and medical supplies, and the appraisal at the end of the program. Not only COVID-19 related symptoms but also other psychological problems are also dealt with during consultations. This program started on March 18, and over 1,700 recovered patients have been receiving counseling as of April 28.

Treatments following early AD detection can significantly delay institutionalisation and extend patients' independence. There has been a growing focus on early AD detection using artificial intelligence. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven revolutionary for image-based applications and have been applied to brain scans. In recent years, studies have utilised two-dimensional (2D) CNNs on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for AD detection. To apply a 2D CNN on three-dimensional (3D) MRI volumes, each MRI scan is split into 2D image slices. A CNN is trained over the image slices by calculating a loss function between each subject's label and each image slice's predicted output. Although 2D CNNs can discover spatial dependencies in an image slice, they cannot understand the temporal dependencies among 2D image slices in a 3D MRI volume. This study aims to resolve this issue by modelling the sequence of MRI features produced by a CNN with deep sequence-based networks for AD detection. METHOD: The CNN utilised in this paper was ResNet-18 pre-trained on an ImageNet dataset. The employed sequence-based models were the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and different types of recurrent neural networks. Several deep sequence-based models and configurations were implemented and compared for AD detection. RESULTS: Our proposed TCN model achieved the best classification performance with 91.78% accuracy, 91.56% sensitivity and 92% specificity. CONCLUSION: Our results show that applying sequence-based models can improve the classification accuracy of 2D and 3D CNNs for AD detection by up to 10%.","Ebrahimi, Amir; Luo, Suhuai; Chiong, Raymond",Comput Biol Med,579,21

There are no evidence-based, validated tools to assist physicians in management and disposition decisions for children presenting to the ED with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The objective of this study is to develop a clinical prediction model to accurately stratify children with CAP who are at risk for low, moderate and severe disease across a global network of EDs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a prospective cohort study enrolling up to 4700 children with CAP at EDs at ~80 member sites of the Pediatric Emergency Research Networks (PERN; https://pern-global.com/). We will include children aged 3 months to <14 years with a clinical diagnosis of CAP. We will exclude children with hospital admissions within 7 days prior to the study visit, hospital-acquired pneumonias or chronic complex conditions. Clinical, laboratory and imaging data from the ED visit and hospitalisations within 7 days will be collected. A follow-up telephone or text survey will be completed 7-14 days after the visit. The primary outcome is a three-tier composite of disease severity. Ordinal logistic regression, assuming a partial proportional odds specification, and recursive partitioning will be used to develop the risk stratification models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study will result in a clinical prediction model to accurately identify risk of severe disease on presentation to the ED. Ethics approval was obtained for all sites included in the study. Cincinnati Children's Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB) serves as the central IRB for most US sites. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Results will be disseminated through international conferences and peer-reviewed publications. This study overcomes limitations of prior pneumonia severity scores by allowing for broad generalisability of findings, which can be actively implemented after model development and validation.","Florin, Todd Adam; Tancredi, Daniel Joseph; Ambroggio, Lilliam; Babl, Franz E; Dalziel, Stuart R; Eckerle, Michelle; Mintegi, Santiago; Neuman, Mark; Plint, Amy C; Kuppermann, Nathan",BMJ Open,579,29

In the education sector, governments had to close schools and universities around the world and turn into online mode of delivery. The sudden transformation to online learning demands educators and institutions to develop more innovative teaching methods in supporting students during this growing crisis. It is pertinent that this is the era of large-scale online learning, where education is delivered remotely utilizing various digital platforms. To this end, this move presented many challenges to students, educators, families, administrators, and government regulations. In this paper, we conduct an oriented and well-rounded survey that captures all aspects of distance learning verticals as perceived by educators in order to study online delivery aspects, including teaching models, communication media, and teaching best practices in distance learning. The paper will answer subtle and comprehensive questions related to student satisfaction and success, technical needs and challenges, teaching models, educator mobility, etc. across different universities in the UAE. In particular, the paper tries to identify best model to use given many key issues related to the adoption of e-learning during COVID-19. Overall, the survey results showed almost all participants agreed that online learning during the COVID-19 is a very good alternative solution to Face-to-Face approach. However, teaching models do vary in promoting students' participation and students' engagement. All participants agree that absence of the proper infrastructure at home will hinder the operation especially in courses with hands-on components. Finally, the educators questioned the credibility of online assessments despite the enforced exam integrity tools and methods. The paper concluded with many recommendations for continuous development of the distance learning systems during and after COVID-19.","Al-Karaki, Jamal N.; Ababneh, Nedal Hamid Yasir Gawanmeh Amjad",Contemporary Educational Technology,579,25

The aim was to evaluate the routine blood tests for diagnosis of COVID-19, determining the diagnostic accuracy of blood biomarkers to differentiate between patients with and without COVID-19. METHODS: Clinical charts, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays from adult patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 (fever, cough and/or dyspnea) at hospital admission were reviewed. Patients were classified into two groups according to RT-PCR COVID-19: positive (COVID-19) or negative (NON-COVID-19). Diagnostic accuracy was determined by analyzing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the cutoff value. In order to reduce the number of false positives, the cutoff value with a specificity of 80% was considered. RESULTS: Two hundred three patients (101 females, 102 males) with ages between 18 and 96 years (mean = 61.3) were studied. Ninety-four were COVID-19 and 109 were NON-COVID-19. Plasma ferritin level was the most accurate biomarker (AUC = 0.847 and 0.804 in women and men, respectively). The following diagnostic criteria for suspected COVID-19 were established with biomarker cutoff values to differentiate between COVID-19 and NON-COVID-19 patients: lymphocytes &#8804; 1.0 x 109/L; eosinophils &#8804; 0.02 x 109/L; ferritin > 125% of upper reference limit (URL); LDH > 125% of URL; hsCRP > 80 mg/L; and D-dimer > 1.2 mg/L. Sensitivity was 66%, 64% 62%, 46%, 43%, and 33% for ferritin, eosinophils, LDH, hsCRP, lymphocytes, and D-dimer, respectively. Of those determined to be COVID-19 patients, 91% met one or more of the diagnostic criteria with these blood biomarkers, and of the NON-COVID-19 patients, 47% did not met any diagnostic criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Blood counts of lymphocytes and eosinophils, and plasma levels of D-dimer, LDH, hsCRP, and ferritin can be used to differentiate patients with and without COVID-19 and as a tool for diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 in adult patients at hospital admission.","Santotoribio, Jose D; Nuñez-Jurado, David; Lepe-Balsalobre, Esperanza",Clinical laboratory,579,20

There is no approved drug for the definitive treatment of the disease. Various drugs are being tried for the treatment of COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). This study was performed to systematically review the therapeutic role of HCQ in COVID-19 from the available literature. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP (WHO), Cochrane Library databases, and two pre-print servers (medRxiv.org and Research Square) were searched for clinical studies that evaluated the therapeutic role of HCQ on COVID-19 until 10 May 2020. The available studies were critically analyzed and the data were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 663 articles were screened and 12 clinical studies (seven peer-reviewed and published studies and five non-peer-reviewed studies from pre-print servers) with a total sample size of 3543 patients were included. Some of the clinical studies demonstrated good virological and clinical outcomes with HCQ alone or in combination with azithromycin in COVID-19 patients, although the studies had major methodological limitations. Some of the other studies showed negative results with HCQ therapy along with the risk of adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: The results of efficacy and safety of HCQ in COVID-19, as obtained from the clinical studies, are not satisfactory, although many of these studies had major methodological limitations. Stronger evidence from well-designed robust randomized clinical trials is required before conclusively determining the role of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19. Clinical prudence is required in advocating HCQ as a therapeutic armamentarium in COVID-19.","Das, Saibal; Bhowmick, Subhrojyoti; Tiwari, Sayali; Sen, Sukanta",Clin Drug Investig,579,29

As patients are usually observed from hospital admission to discharge and drug initiation starts during hospitalization, advanced statistical methods are needed to account for time-dependent drug exposure, confounding and competing events. Our objective is to evaluate the observational studies on the three common methodological pitfalls in time-to-event analyses: immortal time bias, confounding bias and competing risk bias. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search on 23 October 2020, in the PubMed database to identify observational cohort studies that evaluated drug effectiveness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We included articles published in four journals: British Medical Journal, New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association and The Lancet as well as their sub-journals. RESULTS: Overall, out of 255 articles screened, 11 observational cohort studies on treatment effectiveness with drug exposure-outcome associations were evaluated. All studies were susceptible to one or more types of bias in the primary study analysis. Eight studies had a time-dependent treatment. However, the hazard ratios were not adjusted for immortal time in the primary analysis. Even though confounders presented at baseline have been addressed in nine studies, time-varying confounding caused by time-varying treatment exposure and clinical variables was less recognized. Only one out of 11 studies addressed competing event bias by extending follow-up beyond patient discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In the observational cohort studies on drug effectiveness for treatment of COVID-19 published in four high-impact journals, the methodological biases were concerningly common. Appropriate statistical tools are essential to avoid misleading conclusions and to obtain a better understanding of potential treatment effects.","Martinuka, Oksana; von Cube, Maja; Wolkewitz, Martin",Clin. microbiol. infect,579,1

However, the usual supervised approach to debunking via misinformation classification requires human-annotated data and is not suited to the fast time-frame of newly emerging events such as the COVID-19 outbreak. In this paper, we postulate that misinformation itself has higher perplexity compared to truthful statements, and propose to leverage the perplexity to debunk false claims in an unsupervised manner. First, we extract reliable evidence from scientific and news sources according to sentence similarity to the claims. Second, we prime a language model with the extracted evidence and finally evaluate the correctness of given claims based on the perplexity scores at debunking time. We construct two new COVID-19-related test sets, one is scientific, and another is political in content, and empirically verify that our system performs favorably compared to existing systems.

METHODS: Molecular docking on the binding between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of common laboratory mammals and the receptor-binding domain of the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the golden Syrian hamster is an option. Virus challenge, contact transmission, and passive immunoprophylaxis were performed. Serial organ tissues and blood were harvested for histopathology, viral load and titre, chemokine/cytokine assay, and neutralising antibody titre. RESULTS: The Syrian hamster could be consistently infected by SARS-CoV-2. Maximal clinical signs of rapid breathing, weight loss, histopathological changes from the initial exudative phase of diffuse alveolar damage with extensive apoptosis to the later proliferative phase of tissue repair, airway and intestinal involvement with virus nucleocapsid protein expression, high lung viral load, and spleen and lymphoid atrophy associated with marked cytokine activation were observed within the first week of virus challenge. The lung virus titre was between 105-107 TCID50/g.

STUDY DESIGN: PREVENT-HD is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pragmatic, event-driven phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in symptomatic outpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at risk for thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death. Several challenges posed by the pandemic have necessitated innovative approaches to clinical trial design, start-up, and conduct. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by time from COVID-19 confirmation, to either rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily or placebo for 35 days. The primary efficacy end point is a composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, non-central nervous system systemic embolization, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. The primary safety end point is fatal and critical site bleeding according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition. Enrollment began in August 2020 and is expected to enroll approximately 4,000 participants to yield the required number of end point events.

Low absorption of oral administered TFB may cause elevated concentrations in the feces discharged from the salmon into the benthic environment. The polychaete Capitella sp. are often dominant in such habitats and consume organic waste deposited on the sediment. In the present study, Capitella sp. were exposed to doses of TFB in salmon feed of 1, 2 and 4 g TFB kg-1 (0 g TFB kg-1 in control group) over an experimental period of 32 days. Cumulative mortality was 12%-15% in both treatment groups with 1 and 2 g TFB kg-1 and reached 27% in the group with 4 g TFB kg-1. Only the highest dose (4 g TFB kg-1) negatively affected feed intake, growth and respiration of the polychaetes while food conversion efficiency was not affected. At the end of the experiment, the concentrations of TFB in the Capitella sp. were high, in the range of 9.24-10.32 µg g-1 for the three treatment groups. It was suggested that a maximum level of absorption rate was reached, also for the lowest dose. High concentrations of TFB in the Capitella sp. might pose a risk to crustaceans that forage for polychaetes in the vicinity of fish farms.

In addition, neighborhoods with lower rates of poverty and those with fewer residents over 70 have fewer cases.

Again, most of these studies addressed only one severity category of patients or addressed only one efficacy endpoint (mortality). In this context, we conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of steroid therapy among all severity categories of patients with COVID-19 (mild to moderate and severe to critical category) in terms of ""mortality,"" ""requirement of mechanical ventilation,"" ""requirement of ICU"" and clinical cure parameters. METHODS: 11 databases were screened. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or high quality (on the basis of risk of bias analysis) comparative-observational studies were included in the analysis. RevMan5.3 was used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies (3 RCT and 12 comparative-observational studies) were included. In the mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 population, treatment with dexamethasone showed significant protection against mortality (single study). Among severe and critically ill combined population, steroid administration was significantly associated with lowered mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.83 [0.76-0.910]), lowered requirement of mechanical ventilation (RR 0.59 [0.51-0.69]), decreased requirement of intensive care unit (ICU) (RR 0.62 [0.45-0.86]), lowered length of ICU stay (single-study) and decreased duration of mechanical ventilation (two-studies). In mild to moderate population, steroid treatment was associated with a higher ""duration of hospital stay,"" while no difference was seen in other domains. In patients at risk of progression to ""acute respiratory distress syndrome,"" steroid administration was associated with ""reduced requirement of mechanical ventilation"" (single-study). CONCLUSION: This study guides the use of steroid across patients with different severity categories of COVID-19. Among mechanically ventilated patients, steroid therapy may be beneficial in terms of reduced mortality. Among ""severe and critical"" patients; steroid therapy was associated with lowered mortality, decreased requirement of mechanical ventilation, and ICU.

METHODS: We reviewed our department's outpatient clinic visits after the implementation of a telemedicine protocol in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Crossover rates from telehealth to in-person visits were evaluated and guidelines for performing a telemedicine neurological exam were created based on the consensus of 16 neurosurgical attending providers over a four-month period. RESULTS: From March 23, 2020 to July 20, 2020, some 2157 telehealth visits were performed in our department. Some 26 were converted to in-person visits by the provider request with the most cited reason for conversion being the need for a more detailed patient evaluation. Based on these experiences, we created a graphical tutorial to address the key components of the neurological exam with adaptations specific to the telehealth visit. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the global coronavirus pandemic, telemedicine has become an integral part of neurosurgeons' daily practice. Telemedicine failures remain low but primarily occur due to a need for more comprehensive evaluations. We provide guidelines for the neurosurgical exam during telehealth visits in an effort to assuage some of these issues.","Basil, Gregory; Luther, Evan; Burks, Joshua D; Govindarajan, Vaidya; Urakov, Timur; Komotar, Ricardo J; Wang, Michael Y; Levi, Allan D",Cureus,579,12

This study aimed to explore the perceived stress and its relation to the duration of dealing with COVID-19 patients in medical doctors. METHODS: The doctors who work in different medical settings in Iraqi Kurdistan during coronavirus outbreak were invited into this cross-sectional study. The doctors were invited from one pediatric, one emergency, one special corona, and one maternity and gynecology hospital. The ""Perceived Stress Scale -10 (PSS)"" measured the perceived degree of a doctor who experienced stress. The information was collected through a web-based technique to avoid the disease spread. RESULTS: Doctors' mean duration of dealing with suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19 was 1.2 (Range: 0-16 days). The mean stress score was 18.81 out of 40. Most of the doctors had a moderate level of stress (69.4%), followed by a low (21.1%) and a high level of stress (9.6%). The general physicians and medical lab specialties had higher stress scores; 21.56 and 19.88, respectively. The high level of stress was among general physicians and community and family medicine doctors; 20.0% and 25.0%, respectively. Whether or not doctors dealt with suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19, did not have a significant difference over the perceived stress score; 19.02 vs. 18.87; P=0.786). The mean score of stress was raised with increasing duration of dealing with suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19; r=0.202; P=0.004 and decreased with increasing age (r=-0.141; P=0.045), and clinical experience (r=-0.139, P=0.048).

We employ difference-in-differences (DID) estimations to disentangle the lockdown effect on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect, virus effect, and the Spring Festival effect. The lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflows to Wuhan by 76.98%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.31%, and within-Wuhan movements by 55.91%. We also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities – the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak – on the destination cities' new infection cases. We also provide evidence that the enhanced social distancing policies in the 98 Chinese cities outside Hubei province were effective in reducing the impact of the population inflows from the epicenter cities in Hubei province on the spread of 2019-nCoV in the destination cities. We find that in the counterfactual world in which Wuhan were not locked down on January 23, 2020, the COVID-19 cases would be 105.27% higher in the 347 Chinese cities outside Hubei province.

When creating the Covid-19 infection model, the free version of the program was used. This model is only relevant if the pandemic continues at the same pace. There are many factors that can deviate from the presented model in any direction: early release from restrictive measures, virus mutations, forced vaccination of the population, and other measures that directly affect the main indicators of infection development.

At the end of the follow-up, a decrease in the biochemical parameters was observed with ferritin of 727microg/L, CRP of 27mg/dl and D-dimers of 1.18mg/L. In 13/21 patients (61.9%), the CTS was controlled without the need to add other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: STC mortality from SARS-CoV-2 is high despite treatment. A greater inflammatory response was associated with a higher mortality. Although it seems that the early use of GC pulses could control it, and the use of other treatments such as tocilizumab shouldo be, with the study design and its limitations, this conclusion cannot be stablished.","Callejas Rubio, José Luis; Aomar Millán, Ismael; Moreno Higueras, Manuela; Muñoz Medina, Leopoldo; López López, María; Ceballos Torres, Ángel",Rev Esp Geriatr Gerontol,579,16

Among these competing priorities is the issue of access to and affordability of prescription drugs. Here, we outline Biden's plan to directly lower prescription drug spending for payers and patients and to expand access to prescription medications through improved health insurance coverage. These policies could provide important financial protections for Americans against high prescription drug prices. Despite widespread public support for addressing prescription drug prices, many of Biden's plans rely on Congressional action, which will be complicated by the narrow majority held by Democrats in the House and an evenly divided Senate. However, there may be other opportunities to reduce prescription drug spending and improve health insurance enrollment among the uninsured. While directly lowering drug prices would provide the most widespread savings for payers and patients alike, any successful effort to increase the number of Americans enrolled in health insurance or render it more affordable will still likely effectively lower patients' out-of-pocket costs and improve access to prescription drugs.","Gavulic, Kyle A; Dusetzina, Stacie B",J. health polit. policy law,579,24

STD emerge early in the course of the disease, seem to be more common in SARS-CoV-2 infection than in other upper respiratory tract infections, and could in some cases persist for long after resolution of respiratory symptoms. Current evidence suggests that STD probably result from a loss of function of olfactory sensory neurons and taste buds, mainly caused by infection, inflammation, and subsequent dysfunction of supporting non-neuronal cells in the mucosa. However, the possible occurrence of other mechanisms leading to chemosensory dysfunction has also been hypothesized, and contrasting data have been reported regarding the direct infection of sensory neurons by SARS-CoV-2. In this mini-review, we summarize the currently available literature on pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and outcomes of STD in COVID-19 and discuss possible future directions of research on this topic.","Mastrangelo, Andrea; Bonato, Matteo; Cinque, Paola",Neurosci Lett,579,3

Nuclear weapons are often considered the esoteric domain of experts. Yet three recent developments–the ban on above-ground nuclear tests, INF Treaty, and collapse of the Berlin Wall–would not have happened without mass protests. Popular preoccupation with COVID-19, economic distress, racial animus, and climate change makes mobilization of a mass anti-nuclear movement unlikely. The international milieu is thus critical for the nuclear future. President Trump’s reelection is likely to have a pernicious effect on that milieu, hindering international cooperation to limit nuclear weapons and accelerating a destabilizing qualitative arms race. Yet an intense crisis risking nuclear war is unlikely because he wants to avoid involvement in any wars, not start new ones. He will also try to sustain nuclear diplomacy with North Korea, though whether he would satisfy Pyongyang’s stiffer demands remains in doubt. His opponent, Joseph Biden, will face those same demands. Personnel is policy, and the Biden administration will likely be staffed with officials who served under President Obama. That means a return to shoring up alliances, international cooperation, and continuity with Obama’s nuclear policies.

There was a positive correlation between aerosols and intraocular pressure (IOP), and the concentration of aerosols beside the air jet port was the highest. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of IOP on the aerosol density generated during the use of an NCT and provide references and suggestions for daily protection of ophthalmic medical staff during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This cross-sectional clinical trial included 214 eyes of 140 patients from a hospital in Wenzhou city, Zhejiang Province. All subjects' IOPs were measured by an NCT (39 eyes with low IOP, 90 eyes with normal IOP, 37 eyes with moderately high IOP, and 48 eyes with very high IOP) between March 7 and June 17, 2020. The density of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and PM10 generated during the process of IOP measurement with an NCT was analyzed. IOP values were recorded simultaneously. The aerosols generated during different IOP measurements were plotted in scatter plots. RESULTS: PM2.5 was generated more at the air jet port of the tonometer during the process of IOP measurement (H=2.731, P=0.019). Larger quantities of PM2.5 and PM10 were generated when the IOP was higher, and these differences were statistically significant (PM2.5: H=119.476, P<0.001; PM10: H=160.801, P<0.001). Linear correlation analysis with one variable demonstrated that IOP had significantly positive correlations with PM2.5 (r=0.756, P<0.001) and PM10 (r=0.864, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Aerosols can be generated while using an NCT to measure IOP, and aerosols and IOP are positively correlated. Patients with moderately high IOP or very high IOP tend to generate more aerosols during the IOP measurement. The concentration of aerosols beside the air jet port was the highest.","Tang, Yuan; Li, Chunchun; Chen, Yanyan; Chen, Zhangyan; Zhang, Peihua; Wang, Aisun; Huang, Xiaoqiong; Qu, Jia; Li, Mengchen; Ma, Siwen; Vasudevan, Balamurali",J Glaucoma,579,6

This study is aimed at describing the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. Methods: 199 COVID-19 patients were admitted to Wuhan Red Cross Hospital in China from January 24th to March 15th. The cases were divided into diabetic and nondiabetic groups according to the history of taking antidiabetic drugs or by plasma fasting blood glucose level at admission, and the difference between groups were compared. Results: Among 199 COVID-19 patients, 76 were diabetic and 123 were nondiabetic. Compared with nondiabetics, patients with diabetes had an older age, high levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), D-dimer, white blood cell, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and total bilirubin (TBIL), lower levels of lymphocyte, albumin and oxygen saturation (SaO2), and higher mortality (P < 0.05). The two groups showed no difference in clinical symptoms. Diabetes, higher level of D-dimer at admission, and lymphocyte count less than 0.6 × 109/L at admission were associated with increasing odds of death. Antidiabetic drugs were associated with decreasing odds of death. Treatment with low molecular weight heparin was not related to odds of death. Conclusion: The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with diabetes was significantly higher than those without diabetes. Diabetes, higher level of D-dimer, and lymphocyte count less than 0.6 × 109/L at admission were the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.","Li, Guozhen; Deng, Qin; Feng, Jiali; Li, Fang; Xiong, Nian; He, Qiong",J Diabetes Res,579,16

What are the perceptions formed during the period? And what are the challenges and opportunities?Design/methodology/approachThis is an interpretivist qualitative study informed by disaster management theories The study involved the content analysis of existing literature with a focus on COVID-19 and higher education, particularly LISE, in conjunction with an open-ended email questionnaire that was sent to selected LIS educators/faculty/staff from major LIS Schools from eight sub-Saharan African countries The author used personal experiences and observation to supplement the data and the interpretation FindingsResults show more similarities than differences in how the COVID-19 pandemic is experienced and perceived, as well as the challenges and opportunities that it brings to the sector As a whole, political factors are most pronounced, meaning that administration and decision-making need more attention in the sector Also notable is that opportunities are mostly linked to technological factors, which will determine the “new normal” for LISE in the future Almost all the narratives focused on the middle level of (during) the disaster life cycle, which is understandable as the complete cycle of the disaster is yet to come, likely when COVID-19 ceases to be a threat Research limitations/implicationsThe sample was small, as related studies focus more on COVID-19 and higher education, with hardly any focusing on LISE The COVID-19 pandemic has not ended, so the disaster management life cycle cannot be fully exploited Furthermore, the author’s categorization of responses within PEST was largely judgmental Practical implicationsNew research, teaching and learning developmental paths have been created for LISE The study provides practical reflection on the effects of COVID-19 on the sector and HEIs that can inform discourse and responses to the pandemic Originality/valueThe study explores a new research domain in LISE and due to limited research in the domain brings together important voices/narratives – based on their experiences – of LIS educators in Africa on the research area Further, it proposes the future of LISE under COVID-19 within the 4IR framework","Ocholla, Dennis N.",Library Management,579,1

Methods: We extracted claims data for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from the National Health Insurance Service database in Korea from January 20, 2020 to March 31, 2020. We followed up this cohort until death from COVID-19 or discharge from hospital. Results: A total of 5,473 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were analyzed, including 495 with type 2 diabetes and 4,978 without diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes were more likely to be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) (P<0.0001). The incidence of inhospital mortality was higher in patients with type 2 diabetes (P<0.0001). After adjustment for age, sex, insurance status, and comorbidities, odds of ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 2.49; P=0.0416) and in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.13 to 3.21; P=0.0161) among patients with COVID-19 infection were significantly higher in those with type 2 diabetes. However, there was no significant difference between patients with and without type 2 diabetes in ventilator, oxygen therapy, antibiotics, antiviral drugs, antipyretics, and the incidence of pneumonia after adjustment. Conclusion: COVID-19 positive patients with type 2 diabetes had poorer clinical outcomes with higher risk of ICU admission and in-hospital mortality than those without diabetes. Therefore, medical providers need to consider this more serious clinical course when planning and delivering care to type 2 diabetes patients with COVID-19 infection.","You, Ji Hong; Lee, Sang Ah; Chun, Sung-Youn; Song, Sun Ok; Lee, Byung-Wan; Kim, Dae Jung; Boyko, Edward J",,579,2

Emergency departments (ED) in hospitals are on the frontlines, serving an essential function in identifying these patients, isolating them early whilst providing urgent medical care. This outbreak has reinforced the role of Emergency Medicine in public health. This paper documents the challenges faced and measures taken by a tertiary hospital's ED in Singapore, in response to the outbreak. Main body: The ED detected the first case of COVID-19 in Singapore on 22 January 2020 in a Chinese tourist and also the first case of locally transmitted COVID-19 on 3 February 2020. The patient journeys through the patient reception area in the ED and undergoes fever screening before being shunted to isolation areas within the ED. Management and disposition of suspect COVID-19 patients are guided by a close-knit collaboration between ED and department of infectious diseases. With increasing number of patients, back-up plans for expansion of space and staff augmentation have been enacted. Staff safety is also of utmost importance, with provision and guidelines for personal protective equipment and team segregation to ensure no cross-contamination across staff. These have been made possible with an early setup of an operational command and control structure within the ED, managing manpower, logistics, operations, communication and information management and liaison with other clinical departments. Conclusion: With the large numbers of undifferentiated patients managed by the ED to date, more than 820 patients with COVID-19 have been identified in the hospital. Not a single member of the staff of the SGH Emergency Department has come down with the illness. The various measures undertaken by the department have helped to ensure good staff morale and strict adherence to safety procedures. We share the lessons learnt so that others who manage EDs around the world can benefit from our experience.","Quah, Li Juan Joy; Tan, Boon Kiat Kenneth; Fua, Tzay-Ping; Wee, Choon Peng Jeremy; Lim, Chin Siah; Nadarajan, Gayathri; Zakaria, Nur Diana; Chan, Shi-En Joanna; Wan, Paul Weng; Teo, Lin Tess; Chua, Ying Ying; Wong, Evelyn; Venkataraman, Anantharaman",Int.

The number of infected people is rapidly increasing, while the diagnostic method of COVID-19 is only by nucleic acid testing. OBJECTIVE: To explain the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, imaging manifestations and to judge diagnostic value of COVID-19 by analyzing the clinical data of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed patients in a non-outbreak, Shanghai, China. To clarify the early epidemiology and clinical characteristics about COVID-19. METHODS: Cross-sectional, single-center case reports of the 86 patients screened at Zhoupu Hospital in Pudong New District, Shanghai, China, from January 23 to February 16, 2020. Epidemiology, demography, clinical, laboratory and chest CTs were collected and analyzed. The screened patients were divided into COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 based on nucleic acid test results. RESULTS: Of the 86 screened patients, 11 were confirmed (12.8%) by nucleic acid testing (mean age 40.73 ± 11.32, 5 males). No significant differences were found in clinical symptoms including fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, and fatigue (P > 0.05). No statistical difference was observed in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ) of patients (P = 0.402), while the white blood cell count and lymphocyte count of the confirmed patients were slightly lower than those of the suspected patients (P < 0.05). Some non-COVID-19 chest CTs also showed subpleural lesions, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) combined with bronchiectasis; or halo nodules distributed under the pleura with focal GGO; consolidation of subpleural distribution or combined with air bronchi sign and vascular bundle sign, etc. CONCLUSION: The early clinical manifestations and imaging findings of COVID-19 are not characteristic in non-outbreak areas. Etiological testing should be performed as early as possible for clinically suspected patients.","Peng, Ling; Liu, Kang-Yong; Xue, Fei; Miao, Ya-Fang; Tu, Ping-An; Zhou, Chao",Arch Iran Med,579,16

The most worrisome of all arrhythmogenic mechanisms is the QT prolonging effect of various anti-COVID pharmacotherapies that can lead to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the form of torsade des pointes and sudden cardiac death. It is therefore imperative to monitor the QT interval during treatment; however, conventional approaches to such monitoring increase the transmission risk for the staff and strain the health system. Hence, there is dire need for contactless monitoring and telemetry for inpatients, especially those admitted to the intensive care unit, as well as for outpatients needing continued management. In this context, recent technological advances have ushered in a new era in implementing digital health monitoring tools that circumvent these obstacles.

We conducted a historical review of the literature on the origin of the face mask, the scientific evidence of its benefits, and its implications for domestic and international politics. Material and Methods: We performed a comprehensive search for peer- and nonpeer- reviewed literature published between 1905 and 2020. Results: Face mask wearing in hospital settings to prevent disease transmission from health care workers to their patients originates with the first use of the mask in surgery in 1897 by German surgeon Johann von Mikulicz. During the first half of the 20th century, various scientific investigators focused on determining the most effective type of medical mask. The role of the face mask in the general population as a preventive intervention during public health emergencies is supported by historical reports spanning from the European Bubonic Plague in 1619, to the Great Manchurian Plague of 1910-1911, the influenza pandemic of 1918, and the current coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although the face mask has helped against airborne disease transmission, its benefits during pandemics have been filtered through the prism of political leanings and geopolitical interests. Conclusions: Our review suggests that while face mask alone cannot stop pandemics, in conjunction with other nonpharmacologic interventions it can be useful in mitigating them. When cooperation rather than division becomes the norm in the global response to pandemics, the face mask can then unite rather than divide us.","Kristo, Gentian; He, Katherine; Whang, Edward; Fisichella, Piero M",J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech A,579,16

We aimed to share our experience at a single center with an emphasis on collective decision making. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A suspected case was defined as the presence of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and/or positive contact history. SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients were defined as confirmed COVID-19. Between March 12, 2020, and May 15, 2020, all children presenting with fever, cough, or respiratory difficulty were investigated for COVID-19. A total of 719 children were examined at outpatient clinics, and 495 were tested with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for suspicion of COVID-19. A team was organized for monitoring and treating patients either as outpatients or hospitalization. Patients were evaluated in terms of age, gender, travel history, epidemiological history, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory and radiological findings, treatment, and outcome. RESULTS: Sixty patients were hospitalized for suspicion of COVID-19. Forty-three patients were diagnosed as probable or confirmed COVID-19. 21 of 43 patients (48.8%) were PCR confirmed. The remaining 22 were diagnosed by epidemiologic history, clinical assessment, and computerized thorax tomography (CT) findings. The median age was 126 and 78.5 months in PCR positives and PCR negatives, respectively and the youngest patient was a 28 days old baby. Nineteen of the patients had an upper respiratory infection (44.1%). Although five patients had no clinical signs, chest X-ray, or CT revealed pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: As previously reported, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children are mostly mild. Even very young kids can become infected following exposure to sick family members. International and local guidelines are valuable for decision making since it is a new disease. A combination of chest disease, infectious diseases, and emergency care physicians approach will aid the appropriate management of cases.","Duramaz, Burcu Bursal; Turel, Ozden; Korkmaz, Cigdem; Karadogan, Muhammed Talha; Yozgat, Can Yilmaz; Iscan, Akin; Sümbül, Bilge; Erenberk, Ufuk",Klin Padiatr,579,16

Many studies have modeled the efficiency gains of specimen pooling, but few have systematically evaluated the dilution effect of pooling on the sensitivity of tests. Using the frequency distribution of cycle threshold (Ct ) values of our first 838 SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens, we modeled 100 specimens on the same frequency distribution. Given this distribution, we then tested dilutions of 1:5, 1:10, and 1:50 to find the percentage of specimens positive at each Ct value with each pool size. Using the frequency distribution and the percentage of specimens positive at each Ct value, we estimate that pools of 5 lead to 93% sensitivity, pools of 10 lead to 91% sensitivity, and pools of 50 lead to 81% sensitivity. Pools of 5 and 10 lead to some specimens with Ct values of &#8805;32 becoming negative, while pools of 50 lead to some specimens with Ct values of &#8805;28 becoming negative. These sensitivity estimates can inform laboratories seeking to implement pooling approaches as they seek to balance test efficiency with sensitivity.","Bateman, Allen C; Mueller, Shanna; Guenther, Kyley; Shult, Peter",J Med Virol,579,24

However, such models rarely explicitly appeals to theories of human behaviour to justify model assumptions. Here we propose a novel mathematical model of disease transmission via fomites (luggage trays) at airport security screening during an outbreak. Our model incorporates the self-protective behaviour of using hand sanitiser gel in line with the extended parallel processing model (EPPM) of behaviour. We find that changing model assumptions of human behaviour in line with the EPPM gives qualitatively different results on the optimal placement of hand sanitiser gels within an airport compared to the model with naive behavioural assumptions. Specifically, that it is preferable to place hand sanitiser gels after luggage screening in most scenarios, however in situations where individuals perceive high threat and low efficacy this strategy may need to be reviewed. This model demonstrates how existing behavioural theories can be incorporated into mathematical models of infectious disease.","Walters, Caroline E.; Dunbar, Maria Bekker-Nielsen; Weston, Dale; Hall, Ian M.",,579,8

The aim of this study was to observe the behaviour of FM symptoms during the course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Patients who had been diagnosed as having FM for &#8805;3 months were recruited between February and May 2020. The collected data were age, sex, educational level and marital status; height and weight; and the scores of the revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR), the modified Fibromyalgia Assessment Status 2019 (FASmod), and the Polysymptomatic Distress Scale (PDS). The patients were divided into those with or without concomitant COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Eight hundred and ninety-seven (93%) of the 965 patients (881 women [91.3%] and 84 men [8.7%]) were followed up on an outpatient basis because of FM and 68 (7.0%) were either followed up as out-patients or hospitalised because of COVID-19. There was no difference in the sociodemographic data of the two groups, but there were statistically significant between-group differences in the results of the clinimetric tests. The major differences between the score of the items (those with the greatest disease impact) were the following related symptoms: sleep quality (FIQR15), fatigue/energy (FIQR13), pain (FIQR12), stiffness (FIQR14). CONCLUSIONS: The mean total and subdomain scores of all the tests were significantly higher in the patients with COVID-19, which suggests that global FM symptoms are more severe in patients with infection. Further studies of the post-COVID19 patients are being carried out in order to discover whether the worsened symptomatology continues because of their hypersensitised state.","Salaffi, Fausto; Giorgi, Valeria; Sirotti, Silvia; Bongiovanni, Sara; Farah, Sonia; Bazzichi, Laura; Marotto, Daniela; Atzeni, Fabiola; Rizzi, Maurizio; Batticciotto, Alberto; Lombardi, Giovanni; Galli, Massimo; Sarzi-Puttini, Piercarlo",Clin. exp. rheumatol,579,24

The present study examined how meaning in life related to loneliness and the degree to which religious coping strategies mediated these relations. Participants were a sample of 872 adults (242 males and 360 females) drawn from general public in Turkey. Data were collected using Meaning in Life Questionnaire, UCLA Loneliness Scale, and the Religious Coping Measure. Meaning in life was associated with more positive religious coping and less negative religious coping and loneliness. Positive religious coping was associated with less loneliness, while negative religious coping was associated with more loneliness. Religious coping strategies mediated the impact of meaning in life on loneliness. These findings suggest that greater meaning in life may link with lesser loneliness due to, in part, an increased level of positive religious coping strategies and a decreased level of negative coping strategies.","Yildirim, Murat; Kizilgeçit, Muhammed; Seçer, Ismail; Karabulut, Fuat; Angin, Yasemin; Dagci, Abdullah; Vural, Muhammed Enes; Bayram, Nurun Nisa; Çinici, Murat",,579,7

The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of intracanal cryotherapy on postoperative pain after root canal therapy in patients with pulpal or peri-radicular pathosis. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library as well as the top three endodontic journals for relevant papers. We included randomized controlled trials that included adults. Our main outcome was postoperative pain intensity measured with a validated scale. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane criteria and the quality of the included studies using GRADE. We used a random-effects model for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eight studies involving 810 patients were included. The overall risk of bias was moderate. Seven of eight studies used a visual analog scale to measure pain intensity. Compared with controls, intracanal cryotherapy significantly reduced postoperative pain at 6 (mean difference [MD] -1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.61 to -2.14; P < 0.05; I2 = 76%; moderate quality evidence) and 24 hours after the procedure (MD -1.43; 95% CI -0.70 to -2.15; P < 0.05; I2 = 89%; moderate quality evidence). There was no significant effect on pain at 48 and 72 hours and 7 days after the procedure.

It is majorly used in traditional and Ayurvedic system of medicines to treat bronchitis, diarrhea, viral hepatitis, respiratory infections, stomach pain, bronchitis, spleen diseases, coughs, colds and tumors. Articles indexed by Scopus, electronic search as Science Direct, PubMed, are used to collect information about Piper longum. There are many phytochemicals in Pippali, including alkaloids, essential oils, flavonoids and steroids. The pharmacological properties reveal the anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, adulticidal, anti-obesity, anti-fungal, antipyretic and cardio protective effects of the plant. Pipili also has many antiviral activities, and helps to improve the immune system and effectively resist hepatitis B virus. This plant seems to be non-toxic, easy to obtain, inexpensive, and has no side effects. Although there are infinite traces for its medicinal use, however its use in treating viral influenza like diseases is not yet much explored. However, it has strong potential to treat symptoms such as cough, cold and fever. In the wake of the current situation of the global corona virus, it has become essential to look for alternatives that would be effective against the virus as well as provide the additional immunity boosting ability. Therefore, effective experimentation and investigations are essential to consider its competence. Researchers must study the plant in details for its huge potentialities.","Subramaniam, Kanmani Subramanian Selva Kumar Bhargav Sushma Parameswari R.; Praveena, R.; Ravikumar, R.; Elangovan, Yuvaraj Kumar V.

373955,373955,373955,The recruitment legacy of COVID-19,16.762777,4.7254825,2020,"We present a proof of concept for a spectrally selective thermal mid-IR source based on nanopatterned graphene (NPG) with a typical mobility of CVD-grown graphene (up to $3000$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$), ensuring scalability to large areas. For that, we solve the electrostatic problem of a conducting hyperboloid with an elliptical wormhole in the presence of an in-plane electric field. The localized surface plasmons (LSPs) on the NPG sheet allow for the control and tuning of the thermal emission spectrum in the wavelength regime from 3 $\mu$m to 12 $\mu$m. The LSPs along with an optical cavity increase the emittance of graphene from about 2.3% for pristine graphene to 80% for NPG, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art pristine graphene light sources operating in the near-infrared (NIR) by a factor of 100. A maximum emission power per area of 11x10^3 W/m$^2$ at $T=2000$ K for a bias voltage of $V=23$ V is achieved by Joule heating. By generalizing Planck's theory and considering the nonlocal fluctuation-dissipation theorem with nonlocal response of surface plasmons in graphene in RPA, we show that the coherence length of the graphene plasmons and the thermally emitted photons can be as large as 13 $\mu$m and 150 $\mu$m, respectively, providing the opportunity to create phased arrays. The spatial phase variation of the coherence allows for beamsteering of the thermal emission in the range between $12^\circ$ and $80^\circ$ by tuning the Fermi energy. Our analysis of the nonlocal hydrodynamic response leads to the conjecture that the diffusion length and viscosity in graphene are frequency-dependent. Using finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations, coupled mode theory, and RPA, we develop the model of a mid-IR light source based on NPG, which will pave the way to graphene-based optical mid-IR communication, mid-IR color displays, mid-IR spectroscopy, and virus detection.","Shabbir, Muhammad Waqas; Leuenberger, Michael N.",,579,16

However, it has been reported that the relationship between OM-85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections is variable. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate this relationship. METHODS: A systematic literature search up-to May 2020 was performed and 14 studies were detected with 1859 paediatric subjects, of them 890 consumed OM-85. They were reporting relationships between OM-85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections. Odds ratio (OR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated to evaluate the prognostic role of OM-85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections using the dichotomous or continuous method with a random or fixed-effect model. RESULTS: OM-85 consumption was significantly related to lower frequency of respiratory tract infections (MD, -1.16; 95% CI, -1.66 to -0.65, P < .001); lower total duration of respiratory tract infections (MD, -19.51; 95% CI, -23.00 to -16.01, P < .001); lower incidence of respiratory tract infections (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21-0.77, P = .006); lower number of antibiotic courses (MD, -1.40; 95% CI, -2.63 to 0.17, P = .03); and lower antibiotic use (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29-0.52, P < .001). However, OM-85 consumption was not significantly related to adverse event rate (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.52-2.03, P = .94); or to wheezing attacks frequency (MD, -0.25; 95% CI, -0.59 to 0.08, P = .14). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of OM-85 consumption on recurrent respiratory tract infections may have a great effect as a tool to improve subjects' immunity against recurrent respiratory tract infections, which could be helpful in crucial situations, eg, COVID-19 pandemic. OM-85 non-consumers had an independent risk relationship with recurrent respiratory tract infections. This relationship forces us to recommend OM-85 consumption with those with a high risk of recurrent respiratory tract infections to avoid any possible complications.","Cao, Changqing; Wang, Jinghua; Li, Yuning; Li, Yumei; Ma, Liyan; Abdelrahim, Mohamed E A; Zhu, Yi",Int J Clin Pract,579,5

en décembre 2019 à Wuhan en Chine Puis, elle s’est propagée rapidement à plus de 100 pays en moins de trois mois Le 11 mars 2020, l’OMS déclarait officiellement la pandémie Covid-19 En l’absence de traitement efficace contre le SARS-Cov2, les mesures de distanciation sociale et de confinement constituent à ce jour les moyens les plus efficaces de lutte contre la pandémie Néanmoins, ces dernières mesures peuvent présenter des répercussions en particulier sur les patients suivis pour des maladies chroniques Le but de notre étude sera d’évaluer l’impact du confinement chez les patients suivis pour des pathologies cardiaques non Covid-19 Méthodes Nous avons choisi un échantillon aléatoire de patients suivis au service de cardiologie du CHU Tanger-Tétouan Al-Hoceima Nous avons collecté leurs données démographiques ainsi que l’évolution de leurs symptômes, leurs paramètres cliniques, biologiques, et leurs modes de vie au début du confinement et 60 jours après Résultats Nous avons inclus 100 patients L’âge moyen de notre population est de 55 ans±15,86 L’IMC (indice de masse corporelle) moyen est de 26,40 kg/m2±5,84 La pathologie coronaire est présente chez 27 % des patients, valvulaire chez 40 %, et l’insuffisance cardiaque chez 37 % Enfin, les troubles de rythme apparaissent chez 22 % et plus de la moitié de notre échantillon (52 %) est hypertendue Nous avons constaté une prise moyenne significative de poids de 1,71 kg (p&lt;0,000) après 60 jours de confinement avec une augmentation de l’IMC de 0,58 kg/m2 (p&lt;0,005) Le pourcentage des patients ayant une PAS ≥140 mm Hg a connu une évolution de 38 à 44 %, soit une élévation de 6 % (p&lt;0,0001), alors que celui des patients ayant une PAD ≥90 mm Hg est passé de 21 à 15 % (soit une baisse de 6 %, p&lt;0,0001) Vingt patients avaient arrêté de fumer, soit une baisse de 7 % (p&lt;0,0001) Le taux de sédentarité présente une élévation de 22 % (p&lt;0,0001) Les apports caloriques journaliers ont été augmenté de 35,4 % et 46,8 % des patients ont augmenté leurs apports en sel de plus de 4 g/j L’augmentation de l’apport calorique journalier concerne plus les hommes que les femmes (41,9 % des hommes vs 31,3 % des femmes) Chez la population hypertendue, nous n’avons pas observé de différence statistiquement significative de la PAS, de la PAD et de la fréquence cardiaque entre le début et deux mois après le confinement Concernant les patients insuffisants cardiaques, nous avons noté une aggravation des symptômes d’insuffisance cardiaque Ainsi, 8,1 % des patients présentant une dyspnée stade 2 sont passés au stade 3 de la NYHA (32,4 vs 40,5 %), tandis que le pourcentage des patients présentant des OMI a augmenté de 13,5 %, mais de manière non statistiquement significative (p=0,267) Nous avons remarqué un écart de régime avec une augmentation des apports en sel (plus de 4 g par jour) chez plus de la moitié de cette sous-population (55,6 %) pendant la période du confinement Dans la sous-population atteinte de pathologie valvulaire, nous avons relevé une aggravation de la dyspnée chez 7,5 % des patients ;celle-ci est passée du stade 2 au stade 3 de la NYHA avec une augmentation du pourcentage des patients ayant des OMI de 7,5 % à 25 % (p=0,065) Par ailleurs, nous avons constaté une incidence de 10 % d’évènements cardiovasculaires (2 cas d’infarctus de myocarde [dont un est décédé], un décès pour insuffisance cardiaque au stade terminal, 3 hospitalisations pour des poussées d’insuffisance cardiaque, 2 cas de dissections aortiques et 2 cas de fibrillation atriale rapide) Notre constat Selon les résultats de cette étude, le confinement sanitaire a induit d’importantes répercussions sur les patients suivis pour une pathologie cardiaque, d’où la nécessité d’une sensibilisation de ces malades, et surtout de la restructuration de notre système de soins fortement perturbé par la COVID-19 Background The Sars COV-2 infection causing the covid-19 disease has started in December 2019 inWuhan, China, then spread quickly to more than 100 countries in less than 3 months On March, 11th the WHO declared officially the pandemic of Covid 19 In the absence of an effective treatment of the SARS-Cov2 the measures of social distancing and lockdown remain the most effectives ways against the pandemic However, these measures can have repercussions in particular on patients followed for chronic diseases, the goal of our study will be to evaluate the impact of the lockdown on non-Covid cardiac patients Methods We have chosen a random sample of patients followed in the cardiology department of the CHU Tangier Tetouan Alhouceima, and we collected their demographic data as well as the symptoms, vital constants, lifestyle before and 60 days after the lockdown Results A total of 100 patients were included in the study The average age of our population is 55 34 years±15 86 The average BMI (body mass index) is 26 40 Kg/m2±5 84 The coronary artery disease was present in 27% of the patients, valvular disease in 40% and heart failure in 37% Finally, arrhythmias appear in 22% and more than the half of our sample has high blood pressure We noted a significant weight gain of 1 71 Kg (P&lt;0 000) after 60 days of lockdown, with an increase of BMI of 0,58 kg/m2 (P&lt;0,005) The percentage of patients with SBP (systolic blood pressure) ≥140mmHg has evolved from 38 to 44%, thus an increase of 6 % (P&lt;0,0001), while the percentage of the patients with DBP (diastolic blood pressure) ≥90mmHg has passed from 21 to 15 % (thus a decrease of 6 %, P&lt;0,0001) Twenty patients stop smoking, thus a decrease of 7% (P&lt;0,0001) The sedentary lifestyle rate presented an elevation of 22% (P&lt;0,0001) The daily calorie intake has increased of 35,4 % and 46,8 % of the patients increased their salt intake by more than 4 g per day The increase of the daily calorie intake concerned more the men than the women (41,9 % of men vs 31,3 % of the women) In the population with high blood pressure, we have not observed a statistically significant difference of the SBP, the DBP and the heart rate between the beginning and two months after the lockdown Concerning patients with heart Failure, we have noted an worsen of the symptoms of HF Thus, 8,1% of the patients presenting a stage two dyspnea has passed to a stage three of the NYHA (32,4 vs 40,5%), while the percentage of patients with lower limbs edema has increased of 13,5% but in a non-statistically significant way (P=0,267) We have noticed a diet gap with an increase of salt intakes (more than 4g per day) in more than the half of this subpopulation (55,6 %) during the period of the lockdown In the subpopulation of patients with valvular pathology, we have identified a worsening of the dyspnea in 7,5% of the patients;this one has passed from stage two to stage three of the NHYA with an increase of the percentage of patients with lower limbs edema from 7,5% to 25% (P=0,065) Furthermore, we have noticed an incidence of 10% of cardiovascular events (2 cases of myocardial infarction [among which one has deceased], one death because of end stage heart failure, three hospitalizations for congestive heart failure, two cases of aortic dissections and 2 cases of rapid atrial fibrillation) Our observation Depending on the results of this study, the sanitary lockdown induced important repercussions on the patients followed for cardiac diseases, hence the necessity of an awareness of these patients, and mostly a restructuring of our care system strongly disturbed by the Covid 19","Aajal, A.; El

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from the nationally representative online-survey ""COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring in Germany (COSMO)"" was used (wave 17; July 2020). METHODS: In sum, 974 individuals were included in our analytical sample (average age was 45.9 years, SD: 16.5, 18-74 years). Postponed routine health checkups (yes or no) since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed. RESULTS: More than 16% of the individuals reported postponed routine health checkups in the past few months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, individuals aged 30-49 years had postponed health checkups (21%). The probability of postponed health checkups was positively associated with the presence of chronic diseases (odds ratio [OR]: 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-2.47), higher affect regarding COVID-19 (OR: 1.44, 95%-CI: 1.16-1.78), and higher presumed severity of COVID-19 (OR: 1.17, 95%-CI: 1.01-1.35), whereas the outcome measure was not associated with socioeconomic factors. Data showed that a sizeable part (about one of six individuals) of the population reported postponed routine health checkups due to the COVID-19 pandemic between March and July 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Postponed checkups should not be neglected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals at risk for postponed health checkups should be appropriately addressed.","Hajek, A; De Bock, F; Kretzler, B; König, H-H",Public Health,579,18

The reasons for the disparities are manifold, with social determinants of health contributing heavily. Older adults have been identified as being at high risk of significant complications from COVID-19, and age coupled with other factors seems to put older adults belonging to underserved minorities at greatly heightened risk of those complications. The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified yet again racial and ethnic differences in health care that still must be addressed. This will require a multi-pronged approach to move beyond identifying racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in health care to full-force design and implementation of interventions that address this important issue. The next generation of clinicians, researchers, leaders, and policymakers can help advance the cause of eliminating fundamentally unjust health disparities, and our nation's older adults should not be left behind.","Rhodes, Ramona L",J Health Care Poor Underserved,579,24

The objective of this work is to describe the activities promoted by the pharmacist in the care of the critically ill patient in this context. A new organizational structure was designed, analyzing the tasks necessary to make the processes profitable. Two pharmacists joined the critical patient care to help the pharmacist who was already integrated in the ICU team. The development of the operational structure was carried out on three levels. The healthcare activity highlights the daily participation of pharmacists in the two clinical sessions in which the ICU teams evaluated all cases and made decisions. This in turn facilitated the pharmaceutical validation that was carried out in the critical units themselves. In addition, one of the pharmacists created the Immuno-COVID Committee, in which they participated together with different specialists for therapeutic decision-making in the most complex cases. On the other hand, the availability of human and material resources allowed the implantation of centralized elaboration in the Pharmacy Service of many intravenous mixtures, including antibiotics elastomers Pumps for continuous infusion, and non-sterile elaborations. In logistics management, in addition to the acquisition of COVID- 19 therapies, the reconciliation with nursing activity stands out. The physical presence of the pharmacist favored the detection of needs, the availability in time of medications in the unit, including sterile and non-sterile preparations, and coordination with the central pharmacy. In knowledge management, the participation of the pharmacist in the working group for the development of the hospital management protocol COVID-19 stands out. The daily presence in the unit and the joint work with the entire multidisciplinary team demonstrate the value that the pharmacist can bring.

OBJECTIVES: To qualitatively explore the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of palliative care clinicians. Specifically we sought to: 1) Describe the strategies adopted by palliative care clinicians to cope with new challenges including patient and clinician isolation, prognostication of an emergent disease, and rapidly rising numbers of severely ill patients; 2) Identify additions or adjustments to in-person and system-related palliative care training, methods, and tools made during pandemics. METHODS: This descriptive qualitative study utilized a thematic approach for data analysis of individual, semi-structured interviews with palliative care clinicians (n = 25). Codes, categories, and emerging themes were identified through an iterative, comparative method. Methods align with the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) RESULTS: A theme of ""Expanding the reach of palliative care for today and the future"" was identified with three subthemes: 1) Redefining attitudes and hardship due to collective uncertainty, 2) Breaking with the past towards integrated concept of palliative care, and 3) Building capacity through primary palliative care training. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 forced hospital systems to consider the inclusion of palliative care in unforeseen ways due to an uncontrollable, unpredictable disease. Faced with unprecedented uncertainty, palliative care clinicians utilized strategies for integration and innovation across hospitals, particularly in intensive care units and emergency departments. A need to build capacity through increased primary palliative care access and training was identified.","Rowe, Joanna G; Potts, Maryellen; McGhie, Ronan; Dinh, Annie; Engel, Ilana; England, Keisha; Sinclair, Christian T",J. pain symptom manage,579,16

The appropriateness and usefulness of these technologies as a containment measure have since sparked political and academic discussions globally. The present paper contributes to this debate through an exploration of how the national daily newspapers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland reported on the development and adoption of digital contact-tracing apps during early and after stages of the lockdown. These countries were among the first in Europe to develop apps and were critical voices in the debate of decentralized vs. centralized data processing. We conducted thematic analysis on news coverage published between January and May 2020 in high-circulation national daily newspapers from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. A total of 148 articles from nine newspaper companies were included in the final analysis. From our analysis emerged six core themes of the development and adoption of digital contact tracing apps: 1) data governance; 2) role of IT giants; 3) scientific rigor; 4) voluntariness; 5) functional efficacy; 6) role of the app. These results shed light on the different facets of discussion regarding digital contact tracing as portrayed in German-speaking media.

Here, we aimed to study the adverse events of Modernas intramuscular COVID-19 vaccine in young Japanese people. MethodsA case-control study was conducted using a questionnaire survey. Risk factors were determined using a multivariable logistic regression model. We also compared the occurrence of systemic adverse events in three pairs (minor and adult; male and female; and occurrence and non-occurrence of adverse events after the first dose). Propensity matching was used to balance variables. ResultsWe analysed 3,369 data points (1,877 after the first dose and 1,492 after the second dose) obtained from a questionnaire survey of 7,965 vaccinated individuals. Comparing the results of the first and second doses, the incidence of local adverse events did not change significantly; however, the incidence of systemic adverse events increased significantly (p < 0.001). Eighty-three percent of the participants complained of local adverse events, and 65% of participants complained of systemic adverse events. Anaphylaxis occurred in one female student (0.03%). Even when an adverse event occurred, most of the symptoms improved within 3 days. Female sex was associated with systemic adverse events after the first and second doses with odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence interval, CI) of 2.49 (2.03-3.06), and 1.83 (1.28-2.61), respectively. Age (<20 years: minor) was associated with systemic adverse events after the first dose with an OR of 1.80 (1.44-2.24). The results of the analysis of six cohorts that were created using propensity score matching showed that the incidence of systemic adverse events at the first dose in females was significantly higher than that in males, and that of minors was significantly higher than that of adults. What is new and conclusionThe results of this study clarified, for the first time, the risk factors for several adverse events from the injection of Modernas intramuscular COVID-19 vaccine in young Japanese people. This study suggests that women, minors who experienced adverse events after the first dose, those who experienced adverse events after the first dose, and those who had adverse events after the second dose, should be aware of adverse events. What is known and objectiveThe COVID-19 crisis has been spreading worldwide, and the number of infected people is increasing due to the emergence of mutant strains. The COVID-19 vaccine is expected to be effective in preventing coronavirus infection and disease aggravation. In Japan, priority groups, such as healthcare workers and the older adults (aged 65 and over), were the first to be vaccinated. Workplace vaccinations began on 21 June 2021 at universities and businesses; university employees and students have also been vaccinated. In June 2021, in Japan, Modernas intramuscular injection of the COVID-19 vaccine was used for vaccination in places associated with students and corresponding teaching staff. However, as of September 2021, the Comirnaty intramuscular injection vaccine had been used for healthcare workers and elderly people ahead of other COVID-19 vaccines. Adverse events of the Comirnaty intramuscular injection vaccine in healthcare workers and elderly people and that of Modernas intramuscular COVID-19 vaccine in the defence forces, who were prioritised for administration, are currently being studied. However, adverse events associated with the intramuscular injection of Modernas COVID-19 vaccine in young people have not yet been well studied in Japan. 1,2. In addition, racial differences in adverse events following coronavirus vaccines have not been sufficiently studied. We have already reported adverse events associated with the first dose of Modernas intramuscular injection of its COVID-19 vaccine. In Japan, the intramuscular injection of Modernas COVID-19 vaccine will continue to be used in large-scale inoculation venues such as universities and workplaces. Therefore, to clarify the adverse events following coronavirus vaccination in the young Japanese population, we conducted a questionnaire survey after the second dose for students, faculty, and staff who belong to an educational foundation, Kyushu Bunka Gakuen.","Suehiro, Marie; Okubo, Shinya; Nakajima, Kensuke; Kanda, Kosuke; Hayakawa, Masaonobu; Oiso, Shigeru; Kabashima, Tsutomu; Fujita, Hideaki; Ando, Yukio; Muro, Takahiro",,579,24

OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to identify and compare at-home diagnostic tests that have been granted Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) and convey details about COVID-19 diagnostic tests, including regulatory information, pertinent to pharmacy practice. METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) online resources pertaining to COVID-19 tests, EUAs, and medical devices were consulted, as were linked resources from FDA's webpages. Homepages of the 9 COVID-19 home tests with EUAs were comprehensively reviewed. PubMed literature searches were performed, most recently in May 2021, to locate literature about the identified home tests, as were searches of Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Studies were included if they were performed at home or if subjects self-tested at study sites. Samples were collected by a parent or guardian for patients under 18 years of age. Positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) for the clinical diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus was evaluated. RESULTS: Limited data have been published for these home tests given that they are available through EUAs that do not require clinical trials. Fifteen studies were located from searching the literature, but only 2 met the inclusion criteria. Review of the home tests' websites yielded a single study for each test, with the 3 BinaxNOW platforms using the same study for their EUAs. The 9 COVID-19 home tests with EUAs as of May 7, 2021, include 3 molecular tests and 6 antigen tests. These tests had similar performance on the basis of PPA ranging from 83.5% to 97.4% and NPA ranging from 97% to 100%. CONCLUSION: The 9 SARS-CoV-2 home tests demonstrated satisfactory performance in comparison with laboratory real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests. The convenience and ease of use of these tests make them well-suited for home-based rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing.","Kepczynski, Casey M; Genigeski, Jaelin A; Koski, Renee R; Bernknopf, Allison C; Konieczny, Alison M; Klepser, Michael E",,579,16

We use daily new case counts of COVID-19 patients reported by local health administrations from different Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) within the US to parametrize a model that well describes the propagation of the disease in each area. We then introduce a time-varying control input that represents the level of social distancing imposed on the population of a given area and solve an optimal control problem with the goal of minimizing the impact of social distancing on the economy in the presence of relevant constraints, such as a desired level of suppression for the epidemics at a terminal time. We find that with the exception of the initial time and of the final time, the optimal control input is well approximated by a constant, specific to each area, which contrasts with the implemented system of reopening 'in phases'. For all the areas considered, this optimal level corresponds to stricter social distancing than the level estimated from data. Proper selection of the time period for application of the control action optimally is important: depending on the particular MSA this period should be either short or long or intermediate. We also consider the case that the transmissibility increases in time (due e.g. to increasingly colder weather), for which we find that the optimal control solution yields progressively stricter measures of social distancing. We finally compute the optimal control solution for a model modified to incorporate the effects of vaccinations on the population and we see that depending on a number of factors, social distancing measures could be optimally reduced during the period over which vaccines are administered to the population.","Shirin, Afroza; Lin, Yen Ting; Sorrentino, Francesco",Sci Rep,579,2

In contrast, a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) manufactured by Genscript is a quick and simple assay that detects antibodies that inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction, crucial for virus entry into host cells. In this study, we evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity of the sVNT compared with the PRNT using both 50% and 90% SARS-CoV-2 neutralization as a reference-standard. We found that the sVNT provides a high-throughput screening tool prior to confirmatory PRNT testing for the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.","Valcourt, Emelissa J; Manguiat, Kathy; Robinson, Alyssia; Chen, Julie Chih-Yu; Dimitrova, Kristina; Philipson, Clark; Lamoureux, Lise; McLachlan, Elizabeth; Schiffman, Zachary; Drebot, Michael A; Wood, Heidi",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,579,23

In particular, a strong increase in the number of people over 90 is expected in the next two decades. As this phenomenon will lead to an increase in illness and age-related dependency, the study of long-lived people represents an opportunity to explore which lifestyle factors are associated with healthy aging and which with the emergence of age-related diseases, especially Alzheimer's type dementia. The project ""Factors associated with healthy and pathologically aging in a sample of elderly people over 90 in the city of Madrid"" (MADRID+90) brings together a multidisciplinary research team in neurodegenerative diseases that includes experts in epidemiology, neurology, neuropsychology, neuroimaging and computational neuroscience. In the first phase of the project, a stratified random sampling was carried out according to the census of the city of Madrid followed by a survey conducted on 191 people aged 90 and over. This survey gathered information on demographics, clinical data, lifestyles and cognitive status. Here, the main results of that survey are showed. The second phase of the project aims to characterize individual trajectories in the course of either healthy and pathological aging, from a group of 50 subjects over 90 who will undergo a comprehensive clinical examination comprised of neurological and cognitive testing, MRI and EEG. The ultimate goal of the project is to characterize the biophysical and clinical profiles of a population that tends to receive little attention in the literature. A better understanding of the rapidly increasing group of nonagenarians will also help to design new policies that minimize the impact and future social and economic consequences of rapidly aging societies.","Fernández-Blázquez, Miguel A; Del Ser, Teodoro; Frades-Payo, Belén; Ávila-Villanueva, Marina; Valentí-Soler, Meritxell; Benítez-Robredo, María T; Bermejo-Aguña, Antonio; Pedrero-Pérez, Eduardo J; Quilis-Sancho, Javier; Pastor, Ana B; Fernández-Garrido, Concepción; Morales-Alonso, Sara; Diaz-Olalla, José M; Santos, Nadine Correia; Maestú, Fernando; Gómez-Ramírez, Jaime",PLoS One,579,13

We show that, at the time of hospital admission, patients who were equivalent on the clinical ordinal scale displayed significant differential monocyte epigenetic and transcriptomic attributes between those who would survive and those who would succumb to COVID-19. We identified mRNA metabolism, RNA splicing, and interferon signaling pathways as key host responses overactivated by patients who would not survive. Those pathways are prime drug targets to reduce mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients leading us to identify Tacrolimus, Zotatifin, and Nintedanib as three strong candidates for treatment of severely ill patients at the time of hospital admission.

METHODOLOGY: Our study included age and sex-based analysis of epidemiological data of infected and deceased patients from various countries. The patient data was graphically depicted with the slope's calculation to describe a gradual or steep spread of the disease along with subsequent rise or fall in the death reports. RESULTS: Population groups of 20-49 years of age and 50 years-above were highly vulnerable to infection. Interestingly, 20-49 years of age group was most affected in India. However, higher population of the deceased were reported in the 50 years-above in all countries. India and South Korea demonstrated a gradual appearance of COVID-19 positive cases than other countries illustrated by reduced slope %. Further the highest percentage of infected people and deaths were reported from the densely populated states of India. We observed a sex independent prevalence of COVID-19. The BCG and JE vaccine are unique in the vaccination regime of India and South Korea. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced ACE-2 expression in the children's nasal epithelium may be responsible for reduced SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Countries showed varying patterns in COVID-19 spread and associated mortality. It may be influenced by factors, such as screening strategy, countries demography, implementation of lockdown, etc. Due to limited evidence, it would be difficult to point to the influence of the virus on either sexes.

Areas covered: We used PubMed, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov search strategies for relevant papers. We demonstrated some agents with potentially favorable efficacy as well as favorable safety. Several therapies are under assessment to evaluate their efficacy and safety for COVID19. However, the development of different strategies such as SARS-CoV-2-based vaccines and antibody therapy are urgently required beside other effective therapies such as plasma, anticoagulants, and immune as well as antiviral therapies. We encourage giving more attention to antibody-based treatments as an immediate strategy. Although there has not been any approved specific vaccine until now, developing vaccination strategies may have a protective effect against COVID-19. Expert opinion: An antiviral mAbs could be a safe and high-quality therapeutic intervention which is greatly recommended for COVID-19.

Forty-nine (43.8%) patients had prolonged viral RNA shedding. Patients with prolonged viral shedding were older and had a higher rate of hypertension. Proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-2R (IL-2R) and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), were significantly elevated in patients with prolonged viral shedding. Multivariate analysis revealed that hypertension, older age, lymphopenia and elevated serum IL-2R were independent risk factors for prolonged viral shedding. This comprehensive investigation revealed the distinct characteristics between patients with or without prolonged viral RNA shedding. Hypertension, older age, lymphopenia and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines may be correlated with prolonged viral shedding.","Gao, Chun; Zhu, Li; Jin, Cheng Cheng; Tong, Yi Xin; Xiao, Ai Tang; Zhang, Sheng",Clin Immunol,579,16

The mortality rate from COVID-19 is high in hypertensive patients, making this association especially dangerous. There appears to be a consensus, despite the lack of experimental data, that angiotensin II (ANG II) is linked to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. This process may occur due to acquired deficiency of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), resulting in reduced degradation of ANG II. Furthermore, ANG II has a critical role in the genesis and worsening of hypertension. In this context, the idea that there is a surge in the level of ANG II with COVID-19 infection, causing multiple organ injuries in hypertensive patients becomes attractive. However, the role of other components of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in this scenario requires elucidation. The identification of other RAS components in COVID-19 hypertension may provide both diagnostic and therapeutic benefits.

Current treatment relies mainly on self-recovery through patients' immune function. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a kind of multipotent tissue stem cells, which have powerful anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory functions, inhibiting the cytokine storms. In addition, MSCs have a strong ability to repair tissue damage and reduce the risk of severe complications such as acute lung injury and ARDS, and hopefully, reduce the fatality rate in these patients.

If these strategies are not adapted for minority patients of lower socioeconomic status, health inequality will further increase. Patient-centered models of care can successfully improve access and experience for minority patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to present the development process and preliminary acceptability of altering in-person onboarding procedures into internet-based, remote procedures for a mobile health (mHealth) intervention in a population with limited digital literacy. METHODS: We actively recruited safety-net patients (English- and Spanish-speaking adults with diabetes and depression who were receiving care at a public health care delivery system in San Francisco, United States) into a randomized controlled trial of text messaging support for physical activity. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we modified the in-person recruitment and onboarding procedures to internet-based, remote processes with human support. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of how the composition of the recruited cohort might have changed from the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 enrollment period. First, we analyzed the digital profiles of patients (n=32) who had participated in previous in-person onboarding sessions prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Next, we documented all changes made to our onboarding processes to account for remote recruitment, especially those needed to support patients who were not very familiar with downloading apps onto their mobile phones on their own. Finally, we used the new study procedures to recruit patients (n=11) during the COVID-19 social distancing period. These patients were also asked about their experience enrolling into a fully digitized mHealth intervention. RESULTS: Recruitment across both pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods (N=43) demonstrated relatively high rates of smartphone ownership but lower self-reported digital literacy, with 32.6% (14/43) of all patients reporting they needed help with using their smartphone and installing apps. Significant changes were made to the onboarding procedures, including facilitating app download via Zoom video call and/or a standard phone call and implementing brief, one-on-one staff-patient interactions to provide technical assistance personalized to each patient's digital literacy skills. Comparing recruitment during pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, the proportion of patients with digital literacy barriers reduced from 34.4% (11/32) in the pre-COVID-19 cohort to 27.3% (3/11) in the COVID-19 cohort. Differences in digital literacy scores between both cohorts were not significant (P=.49). CONCLUSIONS: Patients of lower socioeconomic status have high interest in using digital platforms to manage their health, but they may require additional upfront human support to gain access. One-on-one staff-patient partnerships allowed us to provide unique technical assistance personalized to each patient's digital literacy skills, with simple strategies to troubleshoot patient barriers upfront. These additional remote onboarding strategies can mitigate but not eliminate digital barriers for patients without extensive technology experience.

CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of POS associated with two pathophysiological issues: one, cardiac POS caused by a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and second, pulmonary POS due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) interstitial pneumonia. POS has resolved after recovery of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Right-to-left interatrial shunt and intrapulmonary shunt caused by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia contributed to refractory hypoxemia and POS.

Therefore, the invasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is usually prevalent in the bat population, into the human population is thought to have necessitated changes in the viral genome for efficient growth in the new environment. In the present study, to understand host-dependent changes in coronavirus genomes, we focused on the mono- and oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and investigated how these compositions changed time-dependently in the human cellular environment. We also compared the oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses prevalent in humans or bats to investigate the causes of changes in the host environment. RESULTS: Time-series analyses of changes in the nucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed a group of mono- and oligonucleotides whose compositions changed in a common direction for all clades, even though viruses belonging to different clades should evolve independently. Interestingly, the compositions of these oligonucleotides changed towards those of coronaviruses that have been prevalent in humans for a long period and away from those of bat coronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: Clade-independent, time-dependent changes are thought to have biological significance and should relate to viral adaptation to a new host environment, providing important clues for understanding viral host adaptation mechanisms.","Iwasaki, Yuki; Abe, Takashi; Ikemura, Toshimichi",BMC Microbiol,579,17

One factor that is being explored throughout patient care is the idea of diet and the role it has on patient outcomes. But the effects of diet following neurotrauma need to be carefully explored in animal models to ensure that they have beneficial effects. The ketogenic diet provides sufficient daily caloric requirements while being potentially neuroprotective and analgesic. In this study, animals were fed a high fat, low carbohydrate diet that led to a high concentration of blood ketone levels that was sustained for as long as the animals were on the diet. Mice fed a ketogenic diet had significantly lower levels of tyrosine and tryptophan but the levels of other monoamines within the spinal cord remained similar to control mice. Mice were fed a standard or ketogenic diet for 7 days before, and 28 days following the injury. Our results show that mice hemisected over the T10-11 vertebrae showed no beneficial effects of being on a ketogenic diet over a 28 day recovery period. Similarly, ligation of the common peroneal and tibial nerve showed no differences between mice fed normal or ketogenic diets. Tests included von Frey, open field, and ladder-rung crossing. We add to existing literature showing protective effects of the ketogenic diet in forelimb injuries by focusing on neurotrauma in the hindlimbs. The results suggest that ketogenic diets need to be assessed based on the type and location of neurotrauma.Significance Statement There is an urgent need for therapeutics to improve outcomes for patients with neurotrauma. Here we test the effects of a non-invasive diet-based therapy. Ketogenic diets, which are high fat and low carbohydrate-based, have been shown to be effective in treating epilepsy, Parkinson's Disease, and show promise for treating other neurotrauma and neurodegenerative conditions. Here we show that while we were successful in producing high ketone concentrations in mice, the effects on recovery of function and pain following a thoracic spinal cord hemisection or spared nerve injury were minimal. Therefore, ketogenic diets, while effective in certain cases, should be evaluated depending on the injury type.","Mayr, Kyle A; Kwok, Charlie H T; Eaton, Shane E A; Baker, Glen B; Whelan, Patrick J",ENeuro,579,29

AIM: To describe nursing leaders' experiences with reorganizing healthcare pathways, through management data and personal accounts. METHODS: A retrospective quali-quantitative observational study was conducted at the Mauriziano Hospital in Turin, with 484 beds and over 1,700 workers. Quantitative data were analyzed through descriptive statistical indices and integrated with qualitative data collected through semi-structured telephone interviews. The analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data provided an objective and experiential representation of the implemented interventions. RESULTS: We described the impact of interventions introduced by the nursing leadership during the pandemic on hospital services. In particular, the reorganization of the emergency department and of the prevention and psychological support services for the hospital's health workers. In addition, specific initiatives to support the discharge of COVID-19 positive patients, and to support and manage contacts with family members both during the hospitalization of their loved ones and following death are described. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study contributes to the discussion on some crucial issues: the increasingly clear relationship between adequate staffing and safety of patients and professionals, the importance of a good working environment and a solid leadership, the importance of continuing education for professionals and adequate skill mixes; all highlighted by the pandemic.","Costamagna, Gabriella; Dasso, Nicoletta; Ottonello, Giulia; Zanini, Milko; Catania, Gianluca; Sasso, Loredana; Bagnasco, Annamaria",Prof Inferm,579,16

Conventional sequence-to-sequence generation methods can produce phrase-level hashtags and have achieved remarkable performance on this task. However, they are incapable of filtering out secondary information and not good at capturing the discontinuous semantics among crucial tokens. A hashtag is formed by tokens or phrases that may originate from various fragmentary segments of the original text. In this work, we propose an end-to-end Transformer-based generation model which consists of three phases: encoding, segments-selection, and decoding. The model transforms discontinuous semantic segments from the source text into a sequence of hashtags. Specifically, we introduce a novel Segments Selection Mechanism (SSM) for Transformer to obtain segmental representations tailored to phrase-level hashtag generation. Besides, we introduce two large-scale hashtag generation datasets, which are newly collected from Chinese Weibo and English Twitter. Extensive evaluations on the two datasets reveal our approach's superiority with significant improvements to extraction and generation baselines.

Conventional local therapies such as surgery and chemoradiation can significantly impact quality of life (QoL). There has been limited data published using stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as primary treatment in previously unirradiated patients. We hypothesize that SBRT provides high rates of control while limiting toxicity. METHODS: A total of 66 medically unfit previously unirradiated patients with HNC were treated with SBRT, consisting of 35-40 Gy to gross tumor volume and 30 Gy to clinical target volume in five fractions. RESULTS: Median age was 80 years. Local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) at 1 year were 73% and 64%. Two patients experienced grade 3 toxicity. CONCLUSION: SBRT shows acceptable outcomes with relatively low toxicity in previously unirradiated patients with HNC who are medically unfit for conventional treatment.

Vaccines are the most cost-effective means of preventing this spread. Traditional methods used to identify and produce new vaccines are not adequate, in most instances, to ensure global protection. New technologies are urgently needed to expedite large scale vaccine development. mRNA-based vaccines promise to meet this need. mRNA-based vaccines exhibit a number of potential advantages relative to conventional vaccines, namely they (1) involve neither infectious elements nor a risk of stable integration into the host cell genome;(2) generate humoral and cell-mediated immunity;(3) are well-tolerated by healthy individuals;and (4) are less expensive and produced more rapidly by processes that are readily standardized and scaled-up, improving responsiveness to large emerging outbreaks. Multiple mRNA vaccine platforms have demonstrated efficacy in preventing infectious diseases and treating several types of cancers in humans as well as animal models.

METHODS: 60 patients who expired between 04/22/2020-05/06/2020 due to COVID-19 were considered for inclusion in the study, based on availability of study staff. Minimally invasive ultrasound-guided autopsy was performed with 14G core biopsies through a 13G coaxial needle. The protocol required 20 cores of the liver, 30 of lung, 12 of spleen, 20 of heart, 20 of kidney, 4 of breast, 4 of testis, 2 of skeletal muscle, and 4 of fat with total of 112 cores per patient. Quality of the samples was evaluated by number, size, histology, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization for COVID-19 and PCR-measured viral loads for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Five (5/60, 8%) patients were included. All approached families gave their consent for the minimally invasive autopsy. All organs for biopsy were successfully targeted with ultrasound guidance obtaining all required samples, apart from 2 patients where renal samples were not obtained due to atrophic kidneys. The number, size, and weight of the tissue cores met expectation of the research group and tissue histology quality was excellent. Pathology findings were concordant with previously reported autopsy findings for COVID-19. Highest SARS-CoV-2 viral load was detected in the lung, liver, and spleen that had small to moderate amount, and low viral load in was detected in the heart in 2/5 (40%). No virus was detected in the kidney (0/3, 0%). CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided percutaneous post-mortem core biopsies can safely provide adequate tissue.

The decedent was initially hospitalized for surgical management of underlying coronary artery disease. He developed post-operative complications and was evaluated with chest imaging studies. The chest computed tomography (CT) imaging results were indicative of COVID-19 and he was subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2, which was positive. His condition worsened and he died after more than 2 weeks of hospitalization and aggressive treatment. The autopsy revealed a range of neuropathological lesions, with features resembling both vascular and demyelinating etiologies. Hemorrhagic white matter lesions were present throughout the cerebral hemispheres with surrounding axonal injury and macrophages. The subcortical white matter had scattered clusters of macrophages, a range of associated axonal injury, and a perivascular acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like appearance. Additional white matter lesions included focal microscopic areas of necrosis with central loss of white matter and marked axonal injury. Rare neocortical organizing microscopic infarcts were also identified. Imaging and clinical reports have demonstrated central nervous system complications in patients' with COVID-19, but there is a gap in our understanding of the neuropathology. The lesions described in this case provide insight into the potential parainfectious processes affecting COVID-19 patients, which may direct clinical management and ongoing research into the disease.

This stressful period may lead to psychological problems, including increases in substance use. OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis consumption before and during COVID-19 lockdown and motives for these changes in substance use. METHOD: A web-based survey was filled out by an unselected population during the social distancing measures of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium that assessed changes in alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis consumption in the period before and during the COVID-19 lockdown and also asked about reasons for change. RESULTS: A total of 3,632 respondents (mean age 42.1 ± 14.6 years; 70% female) filled out the survey. Overall, respondents reported consuming more alcohol (d = 0.21) and smoking more cigarettes (d = 0.13) than before the COVID-19 pandemic (both p < 0.001), while no significant changes in the consumption of cannabis were noted. The odds of consuming more alcohol during the lockdown were associated with younger age (OR = 0.981, p < 0.001), more children at home (OR = 1.220, p < 0.001), non-healthcare workers (p < 0.001), and being technically unemployed related to COVID-19 (p = 0.037). The odds of smoking more cigarettes during the lockdown were associated with younger age (OR = 0.988, p = 0.027), current living situation (p < 0.001), lower education (p = 0.015), and working situation related to COVID-19 (p = 0.018). Boredom, lack of social contacts, loss of daily structure, reward after a hard-working day, loneliness, and conviviality were the main reasons for consuming more of the various substances.

Jitter and shimmer significantly decreased (jitter 1.19±0.83, 0.87±0.67 P = 0.005; shimmer 4.49±2.20, 3.66±2.02 P = 0.002), as did F3 (2855±323.34 Hz, 2781.89±353.42 Hz P = 0.004). F0, MPT, F1 and F2 showed increasing trends without statistical significance, and NHR as well as CPP showed little change without and with wearing medical masks. There were no significant differences seen between males and females. Regarding to age, a significant difference in MPT was seen (>45-year-old 16.15±6.98 s, 15.38±7.02 s; &#8804;45-year-old 20.26±6.47 s, 21.44±6.98 s, P = 0.032). CONCLUSION: Healthy participants showed a significantly higher SPL, a smaller perturbation and an evident decrease in F3 after wearing medical masks. These changes may result from the adjustment of the vocal tract and the filtration function of medical masks, leading to the stability of voices we recorded being overstated. The impacts of medical masks on sex were not evident, while the MPT in the >45-year-old group was influenced more than that in the &#8804;45-year-old group.","Lin, Yuhong; Cheng, Liyu; Wang, Qingcui; Xu, Wen",J. voice,579,5

We used air travel volume estimates from Wuhan, China, to international destinations and a generalized linear regression model to identify locations that could have undetected imported cases. Our model can be adjusted to account for exportation of cases from other locations as the virus spreads and more information on importations and transmission becomes available.

As almost all higher organisms, Ips acuminatus harbours a microbiome, although the role of most members of its microbiome is not well understood. As part of a work in which we analysed the bacterial diversity associated to Ips acuminatus, we isolated the strain Arthrobacter sp. IA7. In order to study its potential role within the bark beetle holobiont, we sequenced and explored its genome and performed a pan-genome analysis of the genus Arthrobacter, showing specific genes of strain IA7 that might be related with its particular role in its niche. Based on these investigations, we suggest several potential roles of the bacterium within the beetle. Analysis of genes related to secondary metabolism indicated potential antifungal capability, confirmed by the inhibition of several entomopathogenic fungal strains (Metarhizium anisopliae CCF0966, Lecanicillium muscarium CCF6041, L. muscarium CCF3297, Isaria fumosorosea CCF4401, I. farinosa CCF4808, Beauveria bassiana CCF4422 and B. brongniartii CCF1547). Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene, six concatenated housekeeping genes (tuf-secY-rpoB-recA-fusA-atpD) and genome sequences indicated that strain IA7 is closely related to A. globiformis NBRC 12137T but forms a new species within the genus Arthrobacter; this was confirmed by digital DNA-DNA hybridization (37.10%) and average nucleotide identity (ANIb) (88.9%). Based on phenotypic and genotypic features, we propose strain IA7T as the novel species Arthrobacter ipsi sp. nov.

We demonstrate activation of ""death"" pathways involvement in diseases of ageing, with biochemical mechanisms mapping onto neurological damage, embryonic development, the inflammatory response, cardiac disease and ultimately cancer with increased significance. There is sufficient bioavailability of the building blocks required to support the continued translation, energy, and functional catalytic activity of proteins. Significant abundance changes occur in 1258 proteins across 1 to 720 h post-mortem of the 12-week-old mouse mandible. Protein abundance increases concord with enzyme activity, while mitochondrial dysfunction is evident with metabolic reprogramming. This study reveals differences in protein abundances which are akin to states of stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS). The control of these pathways is significant for a large number of biological scenarios. Understanding how these pathways function during the process of cellular death holds promise in generating novel solutions capable of overcoming disease complications, maintaining organ transplant viability and could influence the findings of proteomics through ""deep-time"" of individuals with no historically recorded cause of death.","Wasinger, Valerie C; Curnoe, Darren; Boel, Ceridwen; Machin, Naomi; Goh, Hsiao Mei",,579,26

Recently, diverse Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods were proposed to detect botnet attacks in IoT networks. However, highly imbalanced network traffic data in the training set often degrade the classification performance of state-of-the-art ML and DL models, especially in classes with relatively few samples. In this paper, we propose an efficient DL-based botnet attack detection algorithm that can handle highly imbalanced network traffic data. Specifically, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) generates additional minority samples to achieve class balance, while Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) learns hierarchical feature representations from the balanced network traffic data to perform discriminative classification. We develop DRNN and SMOTE-DRNN models with the Bot-IoT dataset, and the simulation results show that high-class imbalance in the training data adversely affects the precision, recall, F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), geometric mean (GM) and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of the DRNN model. On the other hand, the SMOTE-DRNN model achieved better classification performance with 99.50% precision, 99.75% recall, 99.62% F1 score, 99.87% AUC, 99.74% GM and 99.62% MCC.

The latter may vary in different geographic areas according to prescription profiles and vaccination programs. Beta-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides are the most commonly used antimicrobials during the exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and community-acquired pneumonia. In their prescription, different aspects such as intrinsic activity, bactericidal effect or their ability to prevent the development of resistance must be taken into account. The latter is related to the PK/PD parameters, the mutant prevention concentration and the so-called selection window. More recently, the potential ecological impact has grown in importance, not only on the intestinal microbiota, but also on the respiratory one. Maintaining the state of eubiosis requires the use of antimicrobials with a low profile of action on anaerobic bacteria.

Yet to our knowledge, no study has compared the antibacterial efficacy of a large collection of hand sanitizers. Using zone of growth inhibition and kill curve assays, we assessed the performance of 46 commercially available hand sanitizers that were obtained from national chain big-box stores, gasoline stations, pharmacies, and boutiques for antibacterial activity toward prototypical Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacterial pathogens. Results revealed substantial variability in the efficacy of many sanitizers evaluated. Formulations following World Health Organization-recommended ingredients (80% ethanol or 75% isopropyl alcohol) or those including benzalkonium chloride as the active principal ingredient displayed excellent antibacterial activity, whereas others exhibited modest or poor activity in the assays performed. Results also revealed that E. coli was generally more susceptible to most sanitizers in comparison to S. aureus and that there was significant strain-to-strain variability in hand sanitizer antimicrobial efficacy regardless of the organism evaluated. Further, tests of a subset of hand sanitizers toward severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) revealed no direct correlation between antibacterial and antiviral performance, with all ethyl alcohol formulations performing equally well and displaying improved activity in comparison to benzalkonium chloride-containing sanitizer. Taken together, these results indicate that there is likely to be substantial variability in the antimicrobial performance of commercially available hand sanitizers, particularly toward bacterial pathogens, and a need to evaluate the efficacy of sanitizers under development.IMPORTANCE In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, hand hygiene has taken on a prominent role in efforts to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection, which has led to a radical increase in the number and types of hand sanitizers manufactured to meet public demand. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated or compared the antimicrobial performance of hand sanitizers that are being produced under COVID-19 emergency authorization. Tests of 46 commercially available hand sanitizers purchased from national chain brick-and-mortar stores revealed considerable variability in their antibacterial performance toward two bacterial pathogens of immediate health care concern, S. aureus and E. coli Expanded testing of a subset of hand sanitizers revealed no direct correlation between antibacterial performance of individual sanitizers and their activity toward SARS-CoV-2. These results indicate that as the pandemic subsides, there will be a need to validate the antimicrobial efficacy of sanitizers being produced.","Chojnacki, M; Dobrotka, C; Osborn, R; Johnson, W; Young, M; Meyer, B; Laskey, E; Wozniak, R A F; Dewhurst, S; Dunman, P M",MSphere,579,16

As older adults are more vulnerable than those in other age groups in this disaster, their psychological distress in this pandemic is of particular concern. Considering the importance of communities in combating the pandemic, we examined the role of a community in relieving older adults' psychological distress and the heterogeneous effect by older adults' different levels of risk perception.Method: We collected data through a questionnaire survey of 272 older adults in 12 communities in the Sichuan province of China in April 2020, and used the structural equation model to analyze the data.Results: we found that community resilience was negatively associated with older adults' psychological distress (depression, anxiety, stress), and this association was mediated by perceived community prevention effectiveness. However, this indirect effect was stronger for older adults with low risk perceptions than for ones with high risk perceptions (including self-risk perception and group-risk perception).Conclusion: These findings underlined a community's vital significance in alleviating older adults' psychological distress amid the COVID-19 pandemic and moreover indicated that tailored interventions for facilitating community pandemic prevention should be designed for older adults with different risk perceptions.","Zhang, Jinfeng; Wang, Yan; Zhou, Mingjie",Aging Ment Health,579,16

A framework that stimulates sub- and non-state action is a necessary complement to national governmental action, as the latter falls short of achieving low-carbon and climate-resilient development as envisaged in the Paris Agreement. Applying design principles for an ideal-type orchestration framework, we review literature and gather expert judgements to assess whether the GCAA has been collaborative, comprehensive, evaluative and catalytic. Results show that there has been greater coordination among orchestrators, for instance in the organization of events. However, mobilization efforts remain event-driven and too little effort is invested in understanding the progress of sub- and non-state action. Data collection has improved, although more sophisticated indicators are needed to evaluate climate and sustainable development impacts. Finally, the GCAA has recorded more action, but relatively little by actors in developing countries. As the world seeks to recover from the COVID-19 crisis and enters a new decade of climate action, the GCAA could make a vital contribution in challenging times by helping governments keep and enhance climate commitments;strengthening capacity for sub- and non-state action;enabling accountability;and realizing sustainable development. © 2021 The Authors.

A two-stage screening process was conducted by two independent reviewers and a structured data extraction template was populated for each included study. Findings were analyzed thematically using Access to Care Framework domains. RESULTS: In total, 22 studies met inclusion criteria. The majority were published in the past three years and focused on specialized IDD services. A subset of 12 studies reported findings on access to care for adults with IDD. Participants generally reported high acceptability of virtual care, though some preferred face-to-face encounters. Initial results on effectiveness were positive, though limited by small sample sizes. Challenges included internet quality and technical skill or comfort. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that it is possible to deliver accessible, high quality virtual care for adults with IDD, however, relatively little research has been conducted on this topic. Due to COVID-19 there is currently a unique opportunity and urgency to learn when and for whom virtual care can be successful and how it can be supported.","Selick, Avra; Bobbette, Nicole; Lunsky, Yona; Hamdani, Yani; Rayner, Jennifer; Durbin, Janet",Disabil Health J,579,20

India imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 25, 2020, for more than a month to contain the COVID-19 infection. During the nationwide lockdown, transport, industries, and commercial activities were suspended, except for essential services. We made a detailed analysis of the impacts of COVID-19 on air quality in India by using the data from more than 200 Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) and reported a change in the National Air Quality Index (NAQI), spatial distribution and concentration levels of PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2, and O-3 from January to April 2020 nationwide and in five major cities, namely, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, and Hyderabad. We defined the period between February 25 to March 24, 2020, as 'before lockdown' and March 25 to April 30, 2020, as 'during lockdown'. The NAQI and satellite visual maps of AOD, NO2, CO, and SO2 from January to April 2020 showed a significant decrease in air pollution levels in India. The average concentration levels of PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, and SO2 have decreased nationwide by 33, 34, 21, 47, and 21%, respectively, during the nationwide lockdown compared to their concentration levels before the lockdown. While comparing their concentration levels of the nationwide lockdown period with those observed in April 2019 at the same CAAQMS, it was found that the nationwide average concentration levels of PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, and SO2 were decreased by 53, 45, 27, 54, and 35%, respectively. The trends of decreasing air pollutants during the lockdown in five major cities were almost the same as nationwide. The concentration levels of O-3 have shown an increasing trend from January-April 2020 including during the nationwide lockdown. The COVID-19 has provided a rare opportunity for India for the collection of air pollution baseline data which could be useful in the formulation of air pollution reduction policies in the future.","Verma, R.

The purpose of this research brief is to use longitudinal data to compare the number of medical forensic examinations done seasonally prepandemic and during the COVID-19 pandemic shelter-in-place order. Methods This analysis uses retrospective data on medical forensic examinations from January 2010 through November 2020 from one large academic Midwestern hospital. Results Results show that monthly medical forensic examinations have increased over time, from a mean of 4.5 cases per month (range: 1-9) in 2010 to a mean of 9 cases per month (range: 7-11) in 2019. In April 2020, when COVID-19-related shutdowns were at their first peak, cases dropped to a historic low of 0 examinations (the lowest number of cases in the past 10 years). Conclusions The data show an initial drop in the number of survivors seeking postassault care after the COVID shutdown;however, cases rebounded through the second full month of shutdown orders. Programs that provide medical forensic examinations need to be prepared for subsequent waves of survivors, who may be COVID-19 positive. We must be better prepared for many of the adverse consequences impacting individuals around the country related to COVID-19 responses. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Munro-Kramer, M.

The patient was a 27-year-old Japanese female healthcare worker who was scheduled to undergo pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease. She had been in close contact with an undiagnosed patient infected with COVID-19 and then developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite a lack of known risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 infection, the patient's dyspnea worsened and her respiratory condition deteriorated, as indicated by the need for 7 L/min oxygen supply by mask to maintain her oxygen saturation at >90%. Medical treatment was initiated to control hypercortisolism by the 'block and replace' regimen using steroidogenesis inhibitors and hydrocortisone. The COVID-19 pneumonia improved with multi-modal treatment including antiviral therapy. One month later, after a negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) test result and with appropriate protection against virus transmission to medical staff in the operating room and daily medical care nurses, trans-sphenoidal surgery was performed by our highly experienced pituitary surgeon. One month after the surgery, the patient's basal ACTH and cortisol levels and urinary free cortisol were all under the detection limit. Surgical remission was expected. Since hypercortisolism due to active Cushing's disease may worsen a COVID-19 infection, multi-disciplinary management that includes appropriate and prompt treatment strategies is mandatory in such cases.","Yuno, Akiko; Kenmotsu, Yoshiyuki; Takahashi, Yuka; Nomoto, Hiroshi; Kameda, Hiraku; Cho, Kyu Yong; Nakamura, Akinobu; Yamashita, Yu; Nakamura, Junichi; Nakakubo, Sho; Kamada, Keisuke; Suzuki, Masaru; Sugino, Hirokazu; Inoshita, Naoko; Konno, Satoshi; Miyoshi, Hideaki; Atsumi, Tatsuya; Sawamura, Yutaka; Shimatsu, Akira",Endocr J,579,26

This meta-analysis was strictly focused on the influence of smoking history on the severe and critical outcomes on people with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in eight online databases before 1 February 2021. All studies meeting our selection criteria were included and evaluated. Stata 14.0 software was used to analyze the data. Results: A total of 109 articles involving 517,020 patients were included in this meta-analysis. A statistically significant association was discovered between smoking history and COVID-19 severity, the pooled OR was 1.55 (95%CI: 1.41-1.71). Smoking was significantly associated with the risk of admission to intensive care unit (ICU) (OR=1.73, 95%CI: 1.36-2.19), increased mortality (OR=1.58, 95%CI: 1.38-1.81), and critical diseases composite endpoints (OR=1.61, 95%CI: 1.35-1.93), whereas there was no relationship with mechanical ventilation. The pooled prevalence of smoking using the random effects model (REM) was 15% (95%CI: 14%-16%). Meta-regression analysis showed that age (P=0.004), hypertension (P=0.007), diabetes (P=0.029), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (P=0.001) were covariates that affect the association. Conclusions: Smoking was associated with severe or critical outcomes and increased the risk of admission to ICU and mortality in COVID-19 patients, but not associated with mechanical ventilation. This association was more significant for former smokers than in current smokers. Current smokers also had a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 compared with non-smokers. More detailed data, which are representative for more counties, are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.","Zhang, Huimei; Ma, Shaodi; Han, Tiantian; Qu, Guangbo; Cheng, Ce; Uy, John Patrick; Shaikh, Mohammad Baseem; Zhou, Qin; Song, Evelyn J; Sun, Chenyu",Eur J Integr Med,579,20

The present review tries to bring out the correlation between the physiology of sneeze and cough taking into consideration the various receptors that initiate the two reflexes then correlating it with the formation of expelled droplets and the significance of various aspect of droplets that lead to the spread of infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the compilation of the present review we searched the terms ""Physiology of cough"", ""Physiology of sneeze"", ""droplets"", ""aerosols"" and ""Aerosols in COVID 19"". The above-mentioned terms were extensively searched on pubmed, google scholar and google search engine and after reviewing the various available material the most significant research has been taken into consideration for this review. CONCLUSION: Through this review we conclude that there are various factors that are responsible for the initiation of sneeze and cough but in case of infection it is mainly the inflammatory reaction that directly stimulates the receptors to produce the reflex outburst of air. As the flow of air during expiration is turbulent it causes damage to the Epithelial Lining Fluid present in the respiratory conduit and also gets admixed with the saliva in the oropharynx and oral cavity and mucus in the nose to form droplets of various sizes. Large droplets Settle close and are responsible for Droplet and Fomite transmission but the smaller droplets remain suspended in air and travel farther distances to cause Airborne transmission. The spread of droplet cloud in sneezing may range to 6m or more as compared to cough hence the concept of 1m to 2m of social distancing does not hold good if the patient is sneezing.","Singh, Namit Kant; Kumar, Naina; Singh, Amit Kant",Infectious disorders.

METHODS: Clinical, imaging and laboratory data of 120 patients whose COVID-19 diagnosis based on RT-PCR were evaluated retrospectively. Clinically, the severity of COVID-19 was classified as noncomplicated or mild or severe pneumonia. Radiologically, the area of affected lungs compatible with viral pneumonia in each patient's computed tomography was classified as either 0-30% or &#8805; 31% of the total lung area. The D-dimer values and laboratory data of patients with COVID-19 were compared with inpatient status, duration of hospitalization, and lung involvement during treatment and follow-up. To assess the predictive value of D-dimer, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted. RESULTS: D-dimer elevation (> 243 ng/ml) was detected in 63.3% (76/120) of the patients. The mean D-dimer value was calculated as 3144.50 ± 1709.4 ng/ml (1643-8548) for inpatients with severe pneumonia in the intensive care unit. D-Dimer values showed positive correlations with age, duration of stay, lung involvement, fibrinogen, neutrophil count, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR). When the threshold D-dimer value was 370 ng/ml in the ROC analysis, this value was calculated to have 77% specificity and 74% sensitivity for lung involvement in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: D-Dimer levels in patients with COVID-19 correlate with outcome, but further studies are needed to see how useful they are in determining prognosis.","Ozen, Mert; Yilmaz, Atakan; Cakmak, Vefa; Beyoglu, Resad; Oskay, Alten; Seyit, Murat; Senol, Hande",Am J Emerg Med,579,6

Studies on caste-based digital inequality are still scanty in India. Using nationally representative survey data, this paper analyzes the first-level digital divide (ownership of computer and access to the internet) and the second-level digital divide (individual's skill to use computer and the internet) between the disadvantaged caste group and the others. Further, this paper identifies the caste group-based differences in socioeconomic factors that contribute to the digital divide between these groups using a non-linear decomposition method. The results show that there exists a large first-level and second-level digital divide between the disadvantaged caste groups and others in India. The non-linear decomposition results indicate that the caste-based digital divide in India is rooted in historical socioeconomic deprivation of disadvantaged caste groups. More than half of the caste-based digital gap is attributable to differences in educational attainment and income between the disadvantaged caste groups and others. The findings of this study highlight the urgent need for addressing educational and income inequality between the different caste groups in India in order to bridge the digital divide.","Vaidehi, R; Reddy, A Bheemeshwar; Banerjee, Sudatta",,579,16

Despite training and experience, many indicators show nurses are deficient in skills involving emergency and disaster-preparedness competencies. Nurses report little familiarity with disaster-planning skills, the implementation of disaster guidelines and assessment of patients subject to a disaster circumstance. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted based on data collected through an online survey. 118 registered nurses from different clinical settings in Slovenia participated in the study. Data were collected according to the Slovenian version of the Disaster Nursing Core Competencies Scale (Sl-DNCC-Scale). The scale was limited to a 7-point Likert response format (from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree). The results show the registered nurses perceive the core competencies of disaster nursing to be important to their preparedness for disaster situations (median = 161; range 74-189). Registered nurses who work in nursing homes and nurse managers are more aware of the importance of acquiring the listed competencies for unexpected events (p = 0.011 and 0.060 respectively) and the importance of their active role in disaster management (p = 0.027 and p = 0.004, respectively). To effectively deal with a disaster, nurses must be well prepared for unexpected events and more actively involved in disaster management. This study demonstrates that nurses regard the core disaster nursing competencies as important and greatly needed in various healthcare facilities. Future studies in this area should focus on ways to implement these competencies in nursing education.","Karnjus, Igor; Prosen, Mirko; Licen, Sabina",PLoS One,579,20

Prior research suggests that individuals' perceived severity of COVID-19 is related to a range of negative emotional and behavioral reactions among the Chinese public. However, scant research has examined the underlying mechanisms. Drawing upon the risk-resilience model, this study proposes that self-control, as a resilient factor, would potentially moderate the association between perceived severity of COVID-19 and mental health problems. Data from a national survey was used to examine this idea. Participants were 4607 citizens from 31 regions in China (Mage = 23.71 years, 72.5% female) who completed a national survey at the beginning of February 2020. Results of hierarchical regression showed that after controlling for a number of demographic variables, perceived severity of COVID-19 and self-control were positively and negatively related to mental health problems, respectively. More importantly, self-control moderated the ""perceived severity of COVID-19-mental health problems"" association, with this link attenuating as the levels of self-control increased. These findings suggest that compared to those with high self-control, individuals with low self-control are more vulnerable and are more in need of psychological aids to maintain mental health in the encounter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Practically, enhancing individuals' self-control ability might be a promising way to improve individuals' mental health during the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Li, Jian-Bin; Yang, An; Dou, Kai; Cheung, Rebecca Y M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),579,15

This research characterizes risk communication patterns by analyzing the public discourse on the novel coronavirus from four Asian countries: South Korea, Iran, Vietnam, and India, which suffered the outbreak to different degrees. The temporal analysis shows that the official epidemic phases issued by governments do not match well with the online attention on COVID-19. This finding calls for a need to analyze the public discourse by new measures, such as topical dynamics. Here, we propose an automatic method to detect topical phase transitions and compare similarities in major topics across these countries over time. We examine the time lag difference between social media attention and confirmed patient counts. For dynamics, we find an inverse relationship between the tweet count and topical diversity.","Park, Sungkyu; Han, Sungwon; Kim, Jeongwook; Molaie, Mir Majid; Vu, Hoang Dieu; Singh, Karandeep; Han, Jiyoung; Lee, Wonjae; Cha, Meeyoung",,579,14

This informational asset should be thoroughly and wisely used in the coming year colliding in a global task force to control this infection. Epidemiology of this infection shows that the available estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence largely depended on the availability of molecular testing and the extent of tested population. Within molecular diagnosis, the viability and infectiousness of the virus in the tested samples should be further investigated. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 has a genetic normal evolution that is a dynamic process. The immune system participates to the counterattack of the viral infection by pathogen elimination, cellular homoeostasis, tissue repair and generation of memory cells that would be reactivated upon a second encounter with the same virus. In all these stages, we still have knowledge to be gathered regarding antibody persistence, protective effects and immunological memory. Moreover, information regarding the intense pro-inflammatory action in severe cases still lacks and this is important in stratifying patients for difficult to treat cases.

The aim of this study is to investigate the psychosocial factors contributing to the cancellation of medical appointments during the pandemic by patients with pre-existing health conditions. Data were collected in eleven Italian hospitals during the last week of lockdown, and one month later. In order to assess the emotional impact of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the subject's degree of psychological flexibility, we developed an ad hoc questionnaire (ImpACT), referring to the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) model. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (CFQ) were also used. Pervasive dysfunctional use of experiential avoidance behaviours (used with the function to avoid thought, emotions, sensations), feelings of loneliness and high post-traumatic stress scores were found to correlate with the fear of COVID-19, increasing the likelihood of cancelling medical appointments. Responding promptly to the information and psychological needs of patients who cancel medical appointments can have positive effects in terms of psychological and physical health.","Deledda, Giuseppe; Riccardi, Niccolò; Gori, Stefania; Poli, Sara; Giansante, Matteo; Geccherle, Eleonora; Mazzi, Cristina; Silva, Ronaldo; Desantis, Nicoletta; Giovannetti, Ambra Mara; Solari, Alessandra; Confalonieri, Paolo; Grazzi, Licia; Sarcletti, Elena; Biffa, Gabriella; Biagio, Antonio Di; Sestito, Carlo; Keim, Roland; Gangi Hermis, Alida M R Di; Mazzoldi, Mariantonietta; Failo, Alessandro; Scaglione, Anna; Faldetta, Naida; Dorangricchia, Patrizia; Moschetto, Maria; Soto Parra, Hector Josè; Faietti, Jennifer; Profio, Anna Di; Rusconi, Stefano; Giacomelli, Andrea; Marchioretto, Fabio; Alongi, Filippo; Marchetta, Antonio; Molon, Giulio; Bisoffi, Zeno; Angheben, Andrea",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),579,24

Different statistical approaches were applied to gain a comprehensive insight in terms of both the identification of risk factors and the analysis of dependency structure among clinical and demographic characteristics. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus enters host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but whether or not renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) would be beneficial to COVID-19 cases remains controversial. The survival tree approach was applied to define a multilayer risk stratification and better profile patient survival with respect to drug regimens, showing a significant protective effect of RAASi with a reduced risk of in-hospital death. Bayesian networks were estimated, to uncover complex interrelationships and confounding effects. The results confirmed the role of RAASi in reducing the risk of death in COVID-19 patients. De novo treatment with RAASi in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 should be prospectively investigated in a randomized controlled trial to ascertain the extent of risk reduction for in-hospital death in COVID-19.","Cippà, Pietro E; Cugnata, Federica; Ferrari, Paolo; Brombin, Chiara; Ruinelli, Lorenzo; Bianchi, Giorgia; Beria, Nicola; Schulz, Lukas; Bernasconi, Enos; Merlani, Paolo; Ceschi, Alessandro; Di Serio, Clelia",Proc.

Daylight photodynamic therapy (dPDT) is an effective and patient preferred treatment that uses sunlight to clear AK. Currently, there is no standardised method for measuring the light received during treatment. METHODS: SmartPDT® is a smartphone-based application and web-portal, developed by siHealth Ltd, enabling remote delivery of dPDT. It uses satellite imagery and computational algorithms to provide real-time determination of exposure to PpIX-effective solar radiation (""light dose""). The application also provides forecast of expected radiant exposures for 24- and 48-hs prior to the treatment period. Validation of the real-time and forecasted radiant exposure algorithms was performed against direct ground-based measurement under all weather conditions in Chilton, UK. RESULTS: Agreement between direct ground measurements and satellite-determined radiant exposure for 2-h treatment was excellent at -0.1 % ± 5.1 % (meanâ¯±â¯standard deviation). There was also excellent agreement between weather forecasted radiant exposure and ground measurement, 1.8 % ± 17.7 % at 24-hs and 1.6 % ± 25.2 % at 48-hs.

Such individuals are most likely to avail of befriending services offered by a network of Irish organisations. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of COVID-19 guidelines on befriending service users, and to develop recommended adaptations to befriending services compatible with such guidelines. A qualitative constructivist grounded theory approach was taken to the study design and analysis, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from 11 participants by telephone between May 2020 and January 2021. Results show a grounded theory describing how older users of a befriending service maintained their personal autonomy in the face of strict government guidelines. Participants described living life as usual, often contravening guidelines, and how they chose to adapt to the situation, yielding both positive and negative outcomes. Some potential adaptations were discussed to the befriending service (including a preserved focus on the social and emotional functions of the befriending relationship, and the accommodation of collaborative decision making about communicative alternatives), but ultimately it was made clear that participants would tailor the services to their own preferences. Results have implications for befriending service design and delivery, and for public health officials who wish to support the health of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Holton, Eimile; Fitzpatrick, Rachel; Maguire, Rebecca; Commins, Seán; Scharf, Thomas; Lawlor, Brian; Johnson, Natalie; Hannigan, Caoimhe; McHugh Power, Joanna",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),579,1

It was enforced in four phases (i.e., MCO 1, MCO 2, MCO 3 and MCO 4). In this paper, we propose an initiative to assess the impact of MCO by using time-varying reproduction number (Rt). We used data from the Johns Hopkins University Centre for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus repository. Day 1 was taken from the first assumed local transmission of COVID-19. We estimated Rt by using the EpiEstim package and plotted the epidemic curve and Rt. Then, we extracted the mean Rt at day 1, day 5 and day 10 for all MCO phases and compared the differences. The Rt values peaked around day 43, which was shortly before the start of MCO 1. The means for Rt at day 1, day 5, and day 10 for all MCOs ranged between 0.665 and 1.147. The average Rt gradually decreased in MCO 1 and MCO 2. Although spikes in the number of confirmed cases were observed when restrictions were gradually relaxed in the later MCO phases, the situation remained under control with Rt values being stabilised to below unity level (Rt value less than one).","Musa, Kamarul Imran; Arifin, Wan Nor; Mohd, Mohd Hafiz; Jamiluddin, Mohammad Subhi; Ahmad, Noor Atinah; Chen, Xin Wee; Hanis, Tengku Muhammad; Bulgiba, Awang",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),579,24

Previous studies have shown that antibodies that cross-react with thrombopoietin, a regulator of platelet production, can induce thrombocytopenia which is characterized by low platelet count. Thrombocytopenia is associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients and is a rare side effect following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Here we show molecular mimicry between the Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, and human thrombopoietin. Our computational analyses identify a shared five-amino acid long sequence motif (TQLPP) with similar structure and antibody-binding properties for these proteins, strongly indicative of molecular mimicry with potential for cross-reactivity. Our results are supported by reports of the presence of antibodies against epitopes containing TQLPP in both COVID-19 and pre-pandemic patient samples, indicating antibody cross-reactivity between Spike and a human protein. Since the Spike protein is the antigenic component of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, altering the motif may reduce the risk for thrombocytopenia and improve long-term protection against evolving variants. Our findings highlight the importance of considering peptide-level molecular mimicry when developing therapeutic interventions and designing vaccines to avoid potential autoimmune reactions.","Nunez-Castilla, Janelle; Stebliankin, Vitalii; Baral, Prabin; Balbin, Christian A; Sobhan, Masrur; Cickovski, Trevor; Mondal, Ananda M; Narasimhan, Giri; Chapagain, Prem; Mathee, Kalai; Siltberg-Liberles, Jessica",,579,16

There are theories that the oral cavity provides a favorable environment for SARS-CoV-2 entry and persistence which may be a risk for prolonged virus shedding. However, intraoral innate immune mechanisms provide antiviral effects against a myriad of pathogenic viruses. Initial hints of their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 are surfacing. It is hypothesized that intraoral immune system activity modulates the invasion pattern of SARS-CoV-2 into oral cells. Thus, the significance of intraoral tissues for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and persistence cannot be assessed. The underlying concept for this hypothesis was developed by the critical observation of a clinically asymptomatic COVID-19 patient. Despite a positive throat swab for SARS-CoV-2, molecular pathologic analysis of an oral perisulcular tissue specimen failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

Multiple inflammatory mediators implicated in hyperinflammatory syndromes utilize the Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) cascade to propagate their biological function. Our findings demonstrate that oral ruxolitinib dosing designed to mimic clinically relevant JAK-STAT pathway inhibition significantly reduces the harmful consequences of immune overactivation in multiple hyperinflammatory models. In contrast to monoclonal antibody therapies targeting a single cytokine, ruxolitinib effectively downregulates the functional effect of multiple cytokines implicated in hyperinflammatory states, without broad immunosuppression.","Huarte, E.; Peel, M.

Members of marginalized communities experience undue barriers to accessing health care through virtual care technologies, which have become the primary mode of ambulatory health care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Insights generated during the COVID-19 pandemic can inform strategies to promote health equity in virtual care now and in the future. OBJECTIVE: To generate insights arising from literature that was (a) published in direct response to the widespread use of virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (b) had a primary focus on providing recommendations for promoting health equity in the delivery of virtual care. METHODS: In this paper we report a narrative review of literature on health equity and virtual care in the COVID-19 pandemic published between in 2020, describing strategies that have been proposed in the literature at three levels: (1) Policy and government, (2) Organizations and health systems, and (3) Communities and patients. RESULTS: We highlight three strategies for promoting health equity through virtual care that have been under-addressed in this literature, including (1) Simplifying complex interfaces and workflows; (2) Using supportive intermediaries; and (3) Creating mechanisms through which marginalized community members can provide immediate input into the planning and delivery of virtual care. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude by outlining three areas of work that are required to ensure that virtual care is employed in ways that are equity enhancing in a post-COVID reality.","Shaw, Jay; Brewer, LaPrincess; Veinot, Tiffany",,579,15

Since November 2020, the TaqPath COVID-19 assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) has been used to identify viral strains of the new lineage B.1.1.7, since it fails to detect the S-gene with the &#8710;69/70 deletion. Here, we proposed S-gene mutations screening with the Allplex SARS-CoV-2 assay (Seegene), another widely used RT-PCR test that targets Sarbecovirus E, SARS-CoV-2 N, and RdRp/S genes. Accordingly, we evaluated the S gene amplification curve pattern compared to those of the other genes. Exploiting an Allplex assay-generated dataset, we screened 663 RT-PCR digital records, including all SARS-CoV-2 respiratory samples tested in our laboratory with the Allplex assay between January 1st and February 25th, 2021. This approach enabled us to detect 64 samples with peculiar non-sigmoidal amplification curves. Sequencing a selected group of 4 RNA viral genomes demonstrated that those curves were associated with B.1.1.7 variant strains. Our results strongly suggest that B.1.1.7 variant spread has begun in this area at least since January and imply the potential of these analytical methods to track and characterize the spread of B.1.1.7 strains in those areas where Allplex SARS-CoV-2 datasets have been previously recorded.","Ibba, Gabriele; Sau, Rosangela; Angioj, Flavia; Abbondio, Marcello; Rubino, Salvatore; Uzzau, Sergio",J Infect Dev Ctries,579,33

Here, we present a 55-year-old patient who sustained a SSEH several months following a systemic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Case Description: A 55-year-old immunocompromised female (i.e., history 17 years ago of Hodgkin’s lymphoma, nodular sclerosis variant) recently developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. She then reported the sudden onset of cervicodorsalgia after a slight cervical flexion/extension maneuver. The brain and cervicothoracic spine MRI studies documented a clival anterior spinal epidural hematoma with maximum spinal compression at the T1-T2 level;it also extended inferiorly to the T6 level. Two weeks later, the follow-up MRI showed a remarkable reduction in the anteroposterior diameter of the hematoma that correlated with significant neurological improvement and almost complete pain regression. She was discharged after a total 15-day hospital stay, with complete symptoms relief. Conclusion: We present a 55-year-old chronically immunocompromised (i.e., due to the history of Hodgkin’s lymphoma) female who, following a SARS-CoV-2 infection, developed an anterior SSEH extending from the clivus to the T6 spinal level that spontaneously regressed without surgical intervention.","Scalia, G.; Umana, G.

Delay between diagnosis and definitive surgical intervention often leads to a significant readmission rate, growing financial burden and increased complexity of the ultimate surgical intervention. Resource reallocation and reduced operational capacity during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an impending waiting list crisis. Methods: In an attempt to address the backlog of cases, five intensive dedicated operating lists were allocated for laparoscopic cholecystectomies across a weekend in October 2020â¯at a single Trust. Prospective data were collected to include baseline demographics, operative procedure, 30-day post-operative outcomes and financial implications. Results: A total of 21 cholecystectomies were performed in total, with a majority ASA 2 (American Society of Anaesthesiologists) for predominantly biliary colic indication. All were completed laparoscopically, with a 90.5% rate for complete resection. There were no reported on-table complications and 81.0% of patients discharged as a day case. Thirty day follow-up revealed a complication rate of 9.5%, with 2 patients requiring oral antibiotics for a superficial wound infection. The 30 day COVID-19 rate was 14.3%. Compared to completion on an average weekday list, the total weekend was estimated to have saved over £70,000 in overall costs. Conclusion: Our study showed that weekend focused operating, with a caveat of careful patient selection and high-quality multidisciplinary working, can be a feasible solution to long waiting lists due to COVID-19 pandemic. It was safe, with avoidance of increased burden on emergency resources, and significantly increased theatre efficiency.","Clifford, Rachael Elizabeth; Rajput, Kunal; Naing, Chyu Yan; MacDonald, Karen; Pantak, Thomas; Kaul, Anil",Eur Surg,579,24

Compared with traditional small-molecular drugs, antibody therapies are relatively easy to develop; they are as specific as vaccines in targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); and they have thus attracted much attention in the past few months. This article reviews seven existing antibodies for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 with 3D structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Five 3D antibody structures associated with the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein are also evaluated for their potential in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. The interactions of these antibodies with the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) are compared with those between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and RBD complexes. Due to the orders of magnitude in the discrepancies of experimental binding affinities, we introduce topological data analysis, a variety of network models, and deep learning to analyze the binding strength and therapeutic potential of the 14 antibody-antigen complexes.

Several studies have suggested that the pandemic affects not only physical health but also all aspects of society. A lot of information has been reported about the disease since the beginning of the outbreak. For that reason, it is essential to investigate the attitudes and level of knowledge and awareness that different populations had regarding COVID-19 during the critical period of the outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the knowledge and awareness of and attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic among different populations in Central China during the critical period of the outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted in Central China from February to March 2020. The study participants included three different populations: medical workers, students, and those with other occupations. In this study, a questionnaire was designed to collect information on the following four aspects: sociodemographic information, knowledge related to COVID-19, awareness of COVID-19, and attitude toward COVID-19. The chi-square test and Fisher test were used for comparison among groups. The level of significance was set at P<.05. RESULTS: This study enrolled a total of 508 participants. Among them, there were 380 students (74.8%), 39 medical workers (7.7%), and 89 people with other occupations (17.5%). Most of the participants were female (n=272, 53.5%), lived in rural areas (n=258, 50.8%), and were single (n=423, 86.9%). The majority of the respondents had attended college (n=454, 89.4%). Most of the participants said they had heard about COVID-19 by January, and most of them looked for information on social media (Sina Weibo, 84.7%), and WeChat and QQ groups (74.2%). The participants showed an adequate level of knowledge about COVID-19 with no significant differences among the groups. However, medical workers demonstrated a slightly advanced knowledge in their responses to professional questions such as the potential susceptible population, possible host, treatment of COVID-19, and disease category. A higher proportion of medical workers (71.8%) and those in the other occupations group (52.8%) were highly concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 43% of the participants stated that the lockdown of their village/city had a significant impact on their lives. Nevertheless, the majority of respondents had an overall optimistic attitude toward the control of the disease (92.1% of students [n=350], 94.9% of medical workers [n=37], and 92.3% of those in other occupations [n=83]). CONCLUSIONS: All three groups reported an adequate background knowledge about COVID-19 but medical workers showed a slightly advanced knowledge in their responses to professional questions. Most of the participants were highly concerned about COVID-19 during the critical period of the outbreak. The majority of respondents declared that the village/city lockdown policy had a significant impact on their daily life but most of them held an optimistic attitude toward the control of COVID-19.","Xu, Huifang; Gonzalez Mendez, Maria Jose; Guo, Lanwei; Chen, Qiong; Zheng, Liyang; Chen, Peipei; Cao, Xiaoqin; Liu, Shuzheng; Sun, Xibin; Zhang, Shaokai; Qiao, Youlin",J Med Internet Res,579,16

Using daily data on COVID-19 cases and flight on-time performance, and controlling for product, carrier and market characteristics, we find that increases in reported COVID-19 cases are associated with reductions in both departure and arrival delays. Specifically, a standard deviation increase in COVID-19 cases reduces arrival delay by 1 minute 42 seconds and departure delay by 2 minutes, on average. Our results suggest that despite the economic fallout from the pandemic, a silver lining emerges—flights are departing and arriving with less delay amid the pandemic.","Yimga, Jules",Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,579,30

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with trial sequential analysis (TSA). RCT inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM from one of these subgroups: elderly, obese, previous atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), previous coronary-heart disease (CHD), previous heart failure (HF) or previous chronic kidney disease (CKD). RCTs describing those subgroups with at least 48 weeks were included. Outcomes: 3-point MACE; cardiovascular (CV) death; hospitalization due to HF; and renal outcomes. We performed direct meta-analysis with the number of events in the intervention and control groups in each subset, and the relative risk of events was calculated. RESULTS: SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) were the only anti-hyperglycemic agents related to reduction in CV events in different populations. For obese and elderly populations, GLP-1 RA were associated with benefits in 3-point MACE; for patients with ASCVD, both SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA had benefits in 3-point MACE, while for patients with CHD, only SGLT2i were beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA reduced CV events in selected populations: SGLT2i led to a reduction in events in patients with previous CHD, ASCVD and HF. GLP-1 RA led to a reduction in CV events in patients with ASCVD, elderly and patients with obesity. TSA shows that these findings are conclusive.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single-centre, observational, retrospective study enrolling T1D patients who attended a remote visit on April 2020 at the Endocrinology division of the University Hospital Policlinico Consorziale, Bari, Italy. Lockdown-related changes in physical activity level and dietary habits were assessed on a semi-quantitative basis. Changes in general well-being were assessed by the General Health Questionnaire-12 items with a binary scoring system. Glucose metrics were obtained from the Libreview platform for the first 2 weeks of February 2020 (T0) and the last 2 weeks before the phone visit (T1). RESULTS: Out of 84 patients assessed for eligibility, 48 had sufficient FGM data to be included in the analysis. FGM data analysis revealed significant reductions in coefficient of variation, number of hypoglycaemic events, and time below range, while no changes were found in time in range, time above range, mean sensor glucose, and glucose management indicator. Moreover, the frequency of sweets consumption was inversely related to the occurrence of hypoglycaemic events during lockdown.

Comparative studies have not yet been conducted to investigate the impact of these containment measures; these studies are needed to facilitate public health policy-making across countries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe and evaluate the impact of national containment measures and policies (stay-at-home orders, curfews, and lockdowns) on decelerating the increase in daily new cases of COVID-19 in 54 countries and 4 epicenters of the pandemic in different jurisdictions worldwide. METHODS: We reviewed the effective dates of the national containment measures (stay-at-home order, curfew, or lockdown) of 54 countries and 4 epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic (Wuhan, New York State, Lombardy, and Madrid), and we searched cumulative numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and daily new cases provided by health authorities. Data were drawn from an open, crowdsourced, daily-updated COVID-19 data set provided by Our World in Data. We examined the trends in the percent increase in daily new cases from 7 days before to 30 days after the dates on which containment measures went into effect by continent, World Bank income classification, type of containment measures, effective date of containment measures, and number of confirmed cases on the effective date of the containment measures. RESULTS: We included 122,366 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 54 countries and 24,071 patients from 4 epicenters on the effective dates on which stay-at-home orders, curfews, or lockdowns were implemented between January 23 and April 11, 2020. Stay-at-home, curfew, and lockdown measures commonly commenced in countries with approximately 30%, 20%, or 10% increases in daily new cases. All three measures were found to lower the percent increase in daily new cases to <5 within one month. Among the countries studied, 20% had an average percent increase in daily new cases of 30-49 over the seven days prior to the commencement of containment measures; the percent increase in daily new cases in these countries was curbed to 10 and 5 a maximum of 15 days and 23 days after the implementation of containment measures, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Different national containment measures were associated with a decrease in daily new cases of confirmed COVID-19 infection. Stay-at-home orders, curfews, and lockdowns curbed the percent increase in daily new cases to <5 within a month. Resurgence in cases within one month was observed in some South American countries.","Wong, Carlos K H; Wong, Janet Y H; Tang, Eric H M; Au, Chi Ho; Lau, Kristy T K; Wai, Abraham K C",J Med Internet Res,579,16

In total, 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Beijing 302 Hospital were enrolled in this study. Demographic data, symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory values, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected and retrospectively analyzed. A total of 15 (27.3%) patients had severe symptoms, the mean age was 44.0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 34.0-56.0), and the median incubation period was 7.5 days (IQR, 5.0-11.8). A total of 26 (47.3%) patients had exposure history in Wuhan of less than 2 weeks, whereas 20 (36.4%) patients were associated with familial clusters. Also, eighteen (32.7%) patients had underlying comorbidities including hypertension. The most common symptom of illness was fever (45; 81.8%); 51 (92.7%) patients had abnormal findings on chest computed tomography. Laboratory findings showed that neutrophil count, percentage of lymphocyte, percentage of eosinophil, eosinophil count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin, and serum ferritin are potential risk factors for patients with a poor prognosis. A total of 26 patients (47.3%) were still hospitalized, whereas 29 (52.7%) patients had been discharged. Compared with patients in Wuhan, China, the symptoms of patients in Beijing are relatively mild. Older age, more comorbidities, and more abnormal prominent laboratory markers were associated with a severe condition. On the basis of antiviral drugs, it is observed that antibiotics treatment, appropriate dosage of corticosteroid, and gamma globulin therapy significantly improve patients' outcomes.

All these ML-based predictors have been implemented in a freely available software named SMMPPI for prediction of small molecule modulators for clinically relevant PPIs like RBD:hACE2, Bromodomain_Histone, BCL2-Like_BAX/BAK, LEDGF_IN, LFA_ICAM, MDM2-Like_P53, RAS_SOS1, XIAP_Smac, WDR5_MLL1, KEAP1_NRF2 and CD4_gp120. We have identified novel chemical scaffolds as inhibitors for RBD_hACE PPI involved in host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Docking studies for some of the compounds reveal that they can inhibit RBD_hACE2 interaction by high affinity binding to interaction hotspots on RBD. Some of these new scaffolds have also been found in SARS-CoV-2 viral growth inhibitors reported recently; however, it is not known if these molecules inhibit the entry phase.","Gupta, Priya; Mohanty, Debasisa",Brief. bioinform,579,24

METHODS: A total of 967 subjects were tested for IgG antibodies reactive to SARS-CoV-2, including 172 suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2, 656 plasma samples from healthy donors, 49 sera from patients with rheumatic disease, and 90 specimens from individuals positive for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based respiratory viral panel. A subgroup of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive cases was tested for IgM antibodies by proteome array method. RESULTS: All specificity and cross-reactivity specimens were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (0/795, 0%). Positive agreement of IgG with PCR was 83% of samples confirmed to be more than 14 days from symptom onset, with less than 100% sensitivity attributable to a case with severe immunosuppression. Virus-specific IgM was positive in a higher proportion of cases less than 3 days from symptom onset. No association was observed between mild and severe disease course with respect to IgG and IgM levels.

SERA is based on a search engine that compares candidate and reference summaries (called queries) against an information retrieval document base (called index). SERA was originally designed for the biomedical domain only, where it showed a better correlation with manual methods than the widely used lexical-based ROUGE method. In this paper, we take out SERA from the biomedical domain to the general one by adapting its content-based method to successfully evaluate summaries from the general domain. First, we improve the query reformulation strategy with POS Tags analysis of general-domain corpora. Second, we replace the biomedical index used in SERA with two article collections from AQUAINT-2 and Wikipedia. We conduct experiments with TAC2008, TAC2009, and CNNDM datasets. Results show that, in most cases, GeSERA achieves higher correlations with manual evaluation methods than SERA, while it reduces its gap with ROUGE for general-domain summary evaluation. GeSERA even surpasses ROUGE in two cases of TAC2009.

Kardashev's proposal to evaluate the development of celestial civilizations by the amount of energy they are able to use was adopted to translate the concept of human activity into the language of physics. The discussion is limited to considering the last 500 years of history from the beginning of the scientific and technological revolutions to our immediate future. The application of classical and nonequilibrium thermodynamics is discussed. In the framework of classical thermodynamics, two systems are compared: a) the first is a hypothetical quasi-equilibrium system, Earth without a population. Since biological evolution becomes almost imperceptible for a short period of time, such a system remains in the same pristine state for the entire period; (b) the second is our habitable planet, which is not in equilibrium due to rapid anthropogenic evolution and can be considered as a combination of the first system with human civilization. It is shown that in response to the development of civilization (a) the equilibrium of the hypothetical system is disturbed and processes are initiated aimed at reducing the amount of energy produced, and (b) there is a maximum on the path of civilization development over time. The resistance of nature will continue until a new balance is established, corresponding to a lower level of energy production. The central problem is whether humanity is ready and able to agree on a new balance, otherwise the degradation of our planet can lead to the collapse of civilization.","Dobruskin, Vladimir Kh.",,579,1

This study intends to investigate the sensitivity of AT and PS on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus in different provinces of Iran. For this purpose, the information of each province of Iran including the annual average of AT and the number of healthy and diseased cases are categorized. Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity analyses of both AT and PS factors are performed. The obtained results confirm that AT and PS have low sensibility and high sensitivity, respectively. Thus, there is no scientific reason to confirm that the number of COVID-19 cases in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates.

In this review, we conducted a descriptive analysis of CSF findings in patients with COVID-19 to understand prognosis and explore therapeutic options. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases using the keywords ""SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid"" and ""SARS-CoV-2 and CNS Complications"""" for reports of CSF findings in COVID-19 related neurological manifestations. Descriptive analyses were conducted to observe the CSF protein and cell counts based on age, gender, severity, fatality of COVID-19, and whether central (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS) was associated. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients were identified from 67 studies. Of these, 7 patients (6.2%) were fatal COVID-19 cases and 35 patients (31%) were considered severe COVID-19 cases. CSF protein was elevated in 100% (7/7) of the fatal cases with an average of 61.28 mg/dl and in 65.0% (52/80) in non-fatal cases with an average 56.73 mg/dl. CSF protein levels were elevated in 74.5% (38/51) patients with non-severe COVID-19 and 68.6% (24/35) in those with a severe COVID-19 infection.

Viral infection-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury occur because of dysregulation of the immune response. Mesenchymal stem cells appear to be a promising cell therapy given that they favorably modulate the immune response to reduce lung injury. The use of exogenous stem cells may lead to lung repair. Therefore, intervention by transplantation of exogenous stem cells may be required to replace, repair, remodel, and regenerate lung tissue in survivors infected with coronavirus.

Although there are many efficient antiviral agents, they still have drawbacks such as development of virus resistance and accumulation within off-target organs. Encapsulation of antiviral agents into nanoparticles (NPs) has been shown to improve bioavailability, control release, and reduce side effects. However, there is little quantitative understanding of how the uptake of NPs into virally infected cells compares to uninfected cells. In this work, the uptake of fluorescently labeled polymer NPs was investigated in several models of rhinovirus (RV) infected cells. Different multiplicities of RV infections (MOI) and timings of NPs uptake were also investigated. In some cases, RV infection resulted in a significant increase of NPs uptake, but this was not universally noted. For HeLa cells, RV-A16 and RV-A01 infection elevated NPs uptake upon increasing the incubation time, whereas at later timepoints (6 h) a reduced uptake was noted with RV-A01 infection (owing to decreased cell viability). Beas-2B cells exhibited more complex trends: decreases in NPs uptake (cf. uninfected cells) were observed at short incubation times following RV-A01 and RV-A16 infection. At later incubation times (4 h), we found a marked decrease of NPs uptake for RV-A01 infected cells but an increase in uptake with RV-A16 infected cells. Where increases in NPs uptake were found, they were very modest compared to results previously reported for a hepatitis C/ Huh7.5 cell line model. An increase in RV dose (MOI) was not associated with any notable change of NPs uptake. We argue that the diverse endocytic pathways among the different cell lines, together with changes in virus nature, size, and entry mechanism are responsible for these differences. These findings suggest that NPs entry into virally infected cells is a complex process, and further work is required to unravel the different factors which govern this. Undertaking this additional research will be crucial to develop potent nanomedicines for the delivery of antiviral agents.","Abo-Zeid, Yasmin; Williams, Gareth R; Touabi, Lila; McLean, Gary R",Int J Pharm,579,13

We reviewed the academic scholarship describing fiscal and social costs involved in the development of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. Because many ovarian cancer survivors outlive their disease through initial and, perhaps, multiple treatment courses, these women and their treatments provide context for our discussion on financial toxicity. 16 (27%) of 60 articles discuss financial toxicity incurred by women with ovarian cancer; none described financial toxicity associated with regulatory agency-approved or experimental therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. Fiscal costs of radiopharmaceutical dose and schedule and social costs of individual productivity loss or asset expenditure arose as primary financial toxicities.

With a global pandemic that has affected more than 9 million people, many CF clinics were required to take steps to avoid transmission of this dangerous virus.

These measures, along with suggestions from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) to extend the social distancing longer than traditional CDC recommendations for the CF community, create an urgent need to explore novel ways to deliver safer care via new standards in chronic health conditions like CF. Especially, as these preventive strategies may be necessary for long-term maintenance, few objective alternatives exist to guide clinicians and allied health professionals in CF centers how to proceed in this new era. This also presents an opportunity for novel approaches that could improve delivery of CF care with remote monitoring and real-time delivery of care in patients' home environments. Such emerging approaches could benefit patient care, leading to reduced costs and readmissions and improved access to care, medication adherence, and patient communication. We summarize our own experience and discuss the emerging delivery of CF care which can be generalizable to other pulmonary illnesses.","Womack, Caitlin; Farsin, Ruhan; Farsad, Mahsa; Chaudary, Nauman",Int J Gen Med,579,24

But their positive and negative appraisals, and coping behaviour could prevent or ameliorate future problems. OBJECTIVE: To explore the emotional experiences, thought processes and coping behaviours of people with existing mental health problems and carers living through the pandemic. METHODS: UK participants who identified as a mental health service user (N18), a carer (N5) or both (N8) participated in 30-minute semi-structured remote interviews (31 March 2020 to 9 April 2020). The interviews investigated the effects of social distancing and self-isolation on mental health and the ways in which people were coping. Data were analysed using a framework analysis. Three service user researchers charted data into a framework matrix (consisting of three broad categories: ""emotional responses"", ""thoughts"" and ""behaviours"") and then used an inductive process to capture other contextual themes. RESULTS: Common emotional responses were fear, sadness and anger but despite negative emotions and uncertainty appraisals, participants described efforts to cope and maintain their mental wellbeing. This emphasised an increased reliance on technology, which enabled social contact and occupational or leisure activities. Participants also spoke about the importance of continued and adapted mental health service provision, and the advantages and disadvantages associated with changes in their living environment, life schedule and social interactions. CONCLUSION: This study builds on a growing number of qualitative accounts of how mental health service users and carers experienced and coped with extreme social distancing measures early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather than a state of helplessness this study contains a clear message of resourcefulness and resilience in the context of fear and uncertainty.","Simblett, Sara K; Wilson, Emma; Morris, Daniel; Evans, Joanne; Odoi, Clarissa; Mutepua, Magano; Dawe-Lane, Erin; Jilka, Sagar; Pinfold, Vanessa; Wykes, Til",J Ment Health,579,16

With these policies to restart the economy, second wave of epidemic appears in some western European countries and Canada in October 2020. Meanwhile, more and more multiple twice-infected (re-infected) cases have been reported, suggesting the possible rapid loss of natural immunity to COVID-19. A cross-sectional research is attempted in this paper by developing a mathematical ordinary partial differential equations model (the SIR model) of the COVID-19 epidemic with specific emphasize on the immunity loss, this model is able to simulate different epidemic dynamics by considering different rate of immunity loss and duration of suppression policy. Then I conduct a cost-effective analysis on the suppression policy exit-time problem with different scenarios. Finally, there are discussions on several relevant topics (second wave and vaccination) on COVID-19 based on the simulation results from new SIR model. Overall, the speculations of this paper suggest that policy makers should not relax their vigilance too early, since with re-infection in effect, they could no longer hope for herd immunity, while the threat of a second wave draws near. © 2020 IEEE.","Wang, L.","16th Dahe Fortune China Forum and Chinese High-Educational Management Annual Academic Conference, DFHMC 2020",579,1

However, the effectiveness of any vaccine is dictated by the proportion of the population willing to be vaccinated. In this observational population-based study we examined intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 over the course of the pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of 7,547 US adults enrolled in the Understanding America Study (UAS). Participants reporting being willing, undecided and unwilling to get vaccinated against coronavirus across 13 assessments conducted from April-October, 2020. Public attitudes to vaccination against the coronavirus were also assessed. RESULTS: Willingness to vaccinate declined from 71% in April to 53.6% in October. This was explained by an increase in the percentage of participants undecided about vaccinating (from 10.5% to 14.4%) and the portion of the sample unwilling to vaccinate (from 18.5% to 32%). The population subgroups most likely to be undecided/unwilling to vaccinate were those without a degree (undecided: RRR=2.47, 95% CI: 2.04-3.00; unwilling: RRR=1.92, 95% CI: 1.67-2.20), Black participants (undecided: RRR=2.18, 95% CI: 1.73-2.74; unwilling: RRR=1.98, 95% CI: 1.63-2.42), and females (undecided: RRR=1.41, 95% CI: 1.20-1.65; unwilling: RRR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.14-1.46). Those aged 65+, those on high incomes, and other race/ethnicity participants were least likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate. Concerns about potential side effects of a vaccine were common. CONCLUSIONS: Intentions to be vaccinated against coronavirus have declined rapidly during the pandemic and close to half of Americans are undecided or unwilling to be vaccinated.","Daly, Michael; Robinson, Eric",,579,0

In order to address this gap for PMV patients, we developed a modified clinical prediction model based on the ProVent-14 model to predict in-hospital mortality for patients receiving at least 14 days of mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from COVID-19. Methods: We evaluated 107 patients with COVID-19 requiring PMV (at least 14 days of mechanical ventilation (MV)) at 2 tertiary care medical centers in the US in a retrospective observational cohort study. On day 14 of MV, we collected data for the original ProVent-14 variables (age, platelet count, requirement for vasopressors, non-trauma admission, and dialysis requirement). We also collected data for 2 other potential predictor variables (extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on day 14 and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio). Model Development: Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the performance of the ProVent-14 variables with the outcome inhospital mortality. We then assessed successive models adding variable combinations including requirement of ECMO and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio on day 14 to predict inhospital mortality. We assessed discrimination of the models by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We assessed calibration by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit statistic. Results: The AUC for the model using original Provent-14 variables was 0.78 (trauma omitted for N=1). The most parsimonious model using the additional variables includes risk factors age 50-64 and ≥65;platelet count &lt;100, and requirement for vasopressors, renal replacement or ECMO on day 14 of MV. The area under the curve for this model is 0.83. Calibration for the modified parsimonious model is provided in the table below (Goodness-of-fit statistic p=0.80). Dichotomized neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio on day 14 (N:L&gt;15) improves the model slightly AUC=0.83, Goodness-of-fit p=0.61, though this variable was available for only 60% of the cohort. Conclusion: A modified clinical prediction model based on the previously validated ProVent-14 model is a simple method to accurately identify patients with ARDS from COVID-19 requiring PMV who are at high risk of in-hospital mortality. Further validation of model performance in a larger population and including long-term survival is warranted.","Sines, B.; Chang, L. H.; Reid, T.; Carson, S. S.; Douglas, I.

A common approach to this problem involves fitting daily transmission rates using a Susceptive Exposed Infected Recovered (SEIR) model (regularizing them to avoid overfitting), and then computing the relationship between the estimated transmission rate and mobility. Unfortunately, there are often several, very different transmission rate trajectories that can fit the reported cases well, meaning that the choice of regularization determines the final solution (and thus the mobility-transmission rate relationship) selected by the SEIR model. Moreover, the classical approaches to regularization-penalizing the derivative of the transmission rate trajectory-do not correspond to realistic properties of pandemic spread. Consequently, models fit using derivative-based regularization are often biased toward underestimating the current transmission rate and future deaths. In this work, we propose mobility-driven regularization of the SEIR transmission rate trajectory. This method rectifies the artificial regularization problem, produces more accurate and unbiased forecasts of future deaths, and estimates a highly interpretable relationship between mobility and the transmission rate. Mobility data for this analysis was collected by Safegraph (San Francisco, CA) from major US cities between March and August 2020.","Parker, Dylan; Pianykh, Oleg",Am. j. epidemiol,579,6

If COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, why is COPD not the leading risk factor for contracting COVID-19? The same odd phenomenon was also observed with other pathogenic human coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but not other respiratory viral infections such as influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. One commonly proposed reason for the low COPD rates among COVID-19 patients is the usage of inhaled corticosteroids or bronchodilators that may protect against COVID-19. However, another possible reason not discussed elsewhere is that lungs in a diseased state may not be conducive for the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to establish COVID-19. For one, COPD causes mucous plugging in large and small airways, which may hinder SARS-CoV-2 from reaching deeper parts of the lungs (i.e., alveoli). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may only localize to the upper respiratory tract of persons with COPD, causing mild or asymptomatic infections requiring no hospital attention. Even if SARS-CoV-2 reaches the alveoli, cells therein are probably under a heavy burden of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and extensively damaged where it may not support efficient viral replication. As a result, limited SARS-CoV-2 virions would be produced in diseased lungs, preventing the development of COVID-19.","Yong, Shin Jie",Med Hypotheses,579,20

However, despite their frequent use, a systematic study of the relative sensitivity of these odorants in mice is not available. Thus, we assayed the ability of C57BL/6J mice to detect a homologous series of primary aliphatic alcohols (1-propanol to 1-heptanol) using a head-fixed Go / No-Go operant conditioning assay combined with highly reproducible stimulus delivery. To aid in the accessibility of our data, we report the animal's threshold to each odorant according to the 1) ideal gas condition, 2) non-ideal gas condition (factoring in the activity of the odorant in the solvent), and 3) the liquid dilution of the odorant in the olfactometer.

We believe caregivers and healthcare providers should not withhold necessary medical care since delay in diagnosis and treatment in these routinely seen medical emergencies may become as big of a threat as COVID-19 itself.","Snapiri, Ori; Rosenberg Danziger, Chen; Krause, Irit; Kravarusic, Dragan; Yulevich, Alon; Balla, Uri; Bilavsky, Efraim",Acta Paediatr,579,16

We propose a novel approach, called DRR4Covid, to learn automated COVID-19 diagnosis and infection segmentation on CXRs from digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). DRR4Covid comprises of an infection-aware DRR generator, a classification and/or segmentation network, and a domain adaptation module. The infection-aware DRR generator is able to produce DRRs with adjustable strength of radiological signs of COVID-19 infection, and generate pixel-level infection annotations that match the DRRs precisely. The domain adaptation module is introduced to reduce the domain discrepancy between DRRs and CXRs by training networks on unlabeled real CXRs and labeled DRRs together.We provide a simple but effective implementation of DRR4Covid by using a domain adaptation module based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and a FCN-based network with a classification header and a segmentation header. Extensive experiment results have confirmed the efficacy of our method; specifically, quantifying the performance by accuracy, AUC and F1-score, our network without using any annotations from CXRs has achieved a classification score of (0.954, 0.989, 0.953) and a segmentation score of (0.957, 0.981, 0.956) on a test set with 794 normal cases and 794 positive cases. Besides, we estimate the sensitive of X-ray images in detecting COVID-19 infection by adjusting the strength of radiological signs of COVID-19 infection in synthetic DRRs. The estimated detection limit of the proportion of infected voxels in the lungs is 19.43%, and the estimated lower bound of the contribution rate of infected voxels is 20.0% for significant radiological signs of COVID-19 infection.

SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus discovered in Hubei province, China, at the end of 2019, became known worldwide for causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Over one year's time period, the scientific community has produced a large bulk of knowledge about this disease and countless reports about its immune-pathological aspects. This knowledge, including data obtained in postmortem studies, points unequivocally to a hypercoagulability state. However, the name COVID-19 tells us very little about the true meaning of the disease. Our proposal is more comprehensive; it intends to frame COVID-19 in more clinical terminology, making an analogy to viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). Thus, we found irrefutable evidence in the current literature that COVID-19 is the first viral disease that can be branded as a viral thrombotic fever. This manuscript points out that SARS-CoV-2 goes far beyond pneumonia or SARS. COVID-19 infections promote remarkable interactions among the endothelium, coagulation, and immune response, building up a background capable of promoting a ""thrombotic storm,"" much more than a ""cytokine storm."" The importance of a viral protease called main protease (Mpro) is highlighted as a critical component for its replication in the host cell. A deeper analysis of this protease and its importance on the coagulation system is also discussed for the first time, mainly because of its similarity with the thrombin and factor Xa molecules, as recently pointed out by structural comparison crystallographic structures.","Costa-Filho, Rubens Carmo; Castro-Faria Neto, Hugo Caire; Mengel, José; Pelajo-Machado, Marcelo; Martins, Marco Aurélio; Leite, Érica Távora; Mendonça-Filho, Hugo Tannus; de Souza, Tatiana de Arruda Campos Brasil; Bello, Gonzalo Bentacor; Leite, José Paulo Gagliardi",Mem.

The dual-color SiO2@QD nanotags with monodispersity and excellent luminescence were synthesized using polyethyleneimine-mediated electrostatic adsorption of dense red CdSe/ZnS-COOH (excitation/emission 365/625 nm) or green CdSe/ZnS-COOH (excitation/emission 365/525 nm) QDs on the surface of 180 nm SiO2 spheres and were conjugated with anti-PCT and anti-CRP monoclonal antibodies, as stable and fluorescent-enhanced QD nanotags in the LFA system. The use of SiO2@QDs with two different fluorescent signals caused the sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex LFA system. As a result, the proposed assay provided a wide logarithmic determination range with a CRP quantitative range of 0.5-103 ng/mL and PCT quantitative range of 0.05-103 ng/mL. The limits of detection (LODs) of CRP and PCT reached 0.5 and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively. The SiO2@QD-based LFA showed great potential as rapid detection tool for the simultaneous monitoring of CRP and PCT in serum sample.","Yang, Xingsheng; Liu, Xiaoxian; Gu, Bing; Liu, Haifeng; Xiao, Rui; Wang, Chongwen; Wang, Shengqi",Mikrochim Acta,579,22

The current coronavirus (COVID-19) disease pandemic has exponentiated these concerns. Increased research on diagnostic tools is currently being implemented in order to assist with rapid identification of the virus, as mass diagnosis and containment is the best way to prevent the outbreak of the virus. Accordingly, there is a growing urgency to establish a point-of-care device for the rapid detection of coronavirus to prevent subsequent spread. This device needs to be sensitive, selective, and exhibit rapid diagnostic capabilities. Electrochemical biosensors have demonstrated these traits and, hence, serve as promising candidates for the detection of viruses. This review summarizes the designs and features of electrochemical biosensors developed for some past and current pandemic or epidemic viruses, including influenza, HIV, Ebola, and Zika. Alongside the design, this review also discusses the detection principles, fabrication techniques, and applications of the biosensors.

The symptoms of infection can be devastating or at the least very debilitating for vulnerable individuals. It is clear that the elderly are at most risk of the adverse impacts of the virus, including hospitalization and death. Others at risk are those with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic conditions and those with a hyper-excitable immune response. Treatment options for those with acute responses to the virus are limited and there is an urgent need for potential strategies that can mitigate these severe effects. One potential avenue for treatment that has not been explored is the microbiome gut/lung axis. In addition to those severely affected by their acute reaction to the virus, there is also a need for treatment options for those that are slow to recover from the effects of the infection and also those who have been adversely affected by the measures put in place to arrest the spread of the virus. One potential treatment option is photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy. PBM has been shown over many years to be a safe, effective, non-invasive and easily deployed adjunctive treatment option for inflammatory conditions, pain, tissue healing and cellular energy. We have also recently demonstrated the effectiveness of PBM to alter the gut microbiome. PBM therapy is worthy of consideration as a potential treatment for those most vulnerable to COVID-19, such as the elderly and those with comorbidities. The treatment may potentially be advantageous for those infected with the virus, those who have a slow recovery from the effects of the virus and those who have been denied their normal exercise/rehabilitation programs due to the isolation restrictions that have been imposed to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liebert, Ann; Bicknell, Brian; Markman, Wayne; Kiat, Hosen",Aging Dis,579,29

METHODS: The study recruited 200 volunteers aged 18 years or older of both sexes diagnosed with COVID-19. Of the 200 volunteers initially selected, the 135 individuals who underwent serological testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on the first visit to the laboratory, were invited to return, after 90 days, and provide a new blood sample for a second assessment of the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Disease severity and longevity of symptoms were evaluated for each individual and associated with the serological profile. RESULTS: Among the 135 individuals who underwent a previous serological test for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody, 125 showed reactivity to IgG (92.6%). Of the 125 individuals with detectable IgG in the first test, 87 (69.6%) showed persistence of this antibody after 90 days and 38 (30.4%) lost IgG reactivity in the second evaluation. The frequency of all reported symptoms was higher in individuals who maintained IgG persistence after 90 days of symptoms.

Several evidences showed that obesity is a major preventable risk factor and disease modifier of some respiratory conditions such as asthma and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS). Co-occurrence of asthma and obesity may be due to common pathogenetic factors including exposure to air pollutants and tobacco smoking, Western diet, and low Vitamin D levels. Lung growth and dysanapsis phenomenon in asthmatic obese children play a role in impaired respiratory function which appears to be different than in adults. Genes involved in both asthma and obesity have been identified, though a gene-by-environment interaction has not been properly investigated yet. The identification of modifiable environmental factors influencing gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms may change the natural history of both diseases. Another important pediatric respiratory condition associated with obesity is Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB), especially Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS). OSAS and obesity are linked by a bidirectional causality, where the effects of one affect the other. The factors most involved in the association between OSAS and obesity are oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and gut microbiota. In OSAS pathogenesis, obesity's role appears to be mainly due to mechanical factors leading to an increase of respiratory work at night-time. However, a causal link between obesity-related inflammatory state and OSAS pathogenesis still needs to be properly confirmed. To prevent obesity and its complications, family education and precocious lifestyle changes are critical. A healthy diet may lead to an improved quality of life in obese children suffering from respiratory diseases. The present review aimed to investigate the links between obesity, asthma and OSAS, focusing on the available evidence and looking for future research fields.","di Palmo, Emanuela; Filice, Emanuele; Cavallo, Alessandra; Caffarelli, Carlo; Maltoni, Giulio; Miniaci, Angela; Ricci, Giampaolo; Pession, Andrea",,579,27

Mental health challenges such as making impossible decisions and working under extreme pressures are expected to be faced by frontline healthcare workers who are directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. However, we question if significant stress levels might also be observed in a subspecialty musculoskeletal outpatient department, where staff are not first-line care providers of COVID-19 patients. We hypothesize that these healthcare workers also face significant psychological strain, and we aim to objectively determine the prevalence using a validated caregiver strain index. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in outpatient musculoskeletal clinics in a tertiary hospital in Singapore. We collected basic demographic data and used a 13-question tool adapted from the validated Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) to measure psychological strain in these healthcare workers. Participants were divided into 2 groups depending on the level of strain experienced. RESULTS: A total of 62 healthcare workers volunteered for this study. There were 32 participants (51.6%) who had 7 or more positive responses (group 1) and the remaining 30 participants (48.4%) were allocated to group 2. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of demographic data. ""Work adjustments"" (74.2%), ""changes in personal plans"" (72.6%), and finding it ""confining"" (72.6%) garnered the most positive responses in the questionnaire. On the other hand, ""financial concerns"" garnered the least positive responses (21.0%). CONCLUSION: The protracted duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and its resultant prolonged adjustments can have unintended consequences of wearing down healthcare resources otherwise allocated to chronic and elective conditions. Countries should ensure that measures are put in place to safeguard the mental well-being of our healthcare workers to avoid needing another reactive strategy in this battle against COVID-19.","Wong, Khai Cheong; Han, Xinyun Audrey; Tay, Kae Sian; Koh, Suang Bee; Howe, Tet Sen",J Orthop Surg Res,579,15

431687,431687,431687,A COVID-19 jab in the right direction,16.6236,5.060043,2021,"Background. Severe forms of COVID-19 are associated with the development of a cytokine storm that is characterized by an increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, one of the leading strategies of treatment for patients with severe forms of COVID-19 is a decrease in the concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of their effect on the organism. Objective: to perform a comparative analysis of clinical and economic constituents of the application of an IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab and systemic glucocorticosteroid dexamethasone for the therapy of severe conditions in patients with COVID-19 based on the published data review. Material and methods. The authors analyzed the data obtained from PubMed/MEDLINE databases on the study dedicated to the application of tocilizumab and dexamethasone for the therapy of severe conditions in patients with COVID-19. A statistical evaluation of the influence of these drugs on the 28-day survival rate of patients with a severe form of COVID-19 was performed. The statistical tools included methods of the attribute-based statistic (attribute-based efficiency, relative efficiency (RE), populational attributive efficiency (PAE)). For the visualization of the clinical efficiency of the compared drugs, the authors applied beta-distribution. Markov's model was used for modeling of the mortality rate. The modeling included the study of a hypothetical cohort of patients (1,000 patients with COVID-19). Besides, the authors evaluated the economic constitutive of the therapy with tocilizumab and dexamethasone. The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. Results. The indication of dexamethasone statistically significantly increases the survival rate by 3.1% and tocilizumab - by 22.5%. RE was 1.04 (95% CI 0.040-2.042) for dexamethasone and 1.66 (95% CI 0.400-2.917) for tocilizumab. The lower border of 95% CI for both drugs was within the range of values &lt;1, which was statistically significant. PAE for dexamethasone was 1.0% (95% CI -0.6-2.6), for tocilizumab - 16.5% (95% CI -0.7-33.7). Lower borders of 95% CI for both drugs ranged within negative values, which was not statistically significant. NNT (dexamethasone) was 32;NNT (tocilizumab) was 4. Markov's modeling showed that the mortality rate among patients who received these drugs was 36 out of 1000 patients with COVID-19 for dexamethasone (initially distributed by the degree of severity according to the official statistical data) and 30 out of 1000 patients for tocilizumab, respectively. The cost of the treatment course with dexamethasone was 107.45 rub., tocilizumab - 78,827.20 rub. Clinical efficiency by the rate of cured patients obtained as a result of Markov's modeling among patients with severe forms of COVID-19 for both drugs was comparable (0.964 for dexamethasone and 0.970 for tocilizumab) with slightly higher values for tocilizumab. Conclusion. Despite relatively comparable clinical efficiency of dexamethasone and tocilizumab and a significantly higher cost the later, it is not impossible to replace tocilizumab with dexamethasone because of a great number of side effects and potential inter-drug interactions during the treatment of severe forms of COVID-19. In particular, dexamethasone therapy should be performed with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus. Procurement planning should be made taking account the reserves of tocilizumab for the stabilization of patients with cytokine storm when dexamethasone application is not safe.","Zhukova, O.

The needs for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for hospital staff and doctors have been overwhelming, even just to rule out patients not infected. High demand for traditionally manufactured devices, challenged by global demand and limited production, has resulted in a call for additive manufactured (3D printed) equipment to fill the gap between traditional manufacturing cycles. This method has the unique ability to pivot in real time, while traditional manufacturing may take months to change production runs. 3D printing has been used to produce a variety of equipment for hospitals including face shields, masks, and even ventilator components to handle the surge. This type of rapid, crowd sourced, design and production resulted in new challenges for regulation, liability, and distribution. This manuscript reviews these challenges and successes of additive manufacturing and provides a forward plan for hospitals to consider for future surge events. Recommendations: To accommodate future surges, hospitals and municipalities should develop capacity for short-run custom production, enabling them to validate new designs. This will rapidly increase access to vetted equipment and critical network sharing with community distributed manufacturers and partners. Clear guidance and reviewed design repositories by regulatory authorities will streamline efforts to combat future pandemic waives or other surge events.","Manero, Albert; Smith, Peter; Koontz, Amanda; Dombrowski, Matt; Sparkman, John; Courbin, Dominique; Chi, Albert",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),579,29

The Unlikely Rebirth of Covid Corporatism,16.668169,4.743422,2020,"Concerns about the advances of the COVID-19 epidemic have sparked many debates around the world. One such discussion revolved around the use of the drug called chloroquine, initially thought to be effective in reducing the mortality rate of the infection. Particularly in Brazil, even after new studies pointed to the drug's ineffectiveness, the federal government kept the recommendation of this drug as an official treatment. The publication of an official authorization of the use of chloroquine on Twitter sparked an intense debate on social media with arguments against and in favor. This paper studies the dynamics of interactions among different user groups around this discussion, relying on network science and topic modeling analyses. Our results highlight two distinct behaviors in Twitter interaction networks, where retweets serve as positive reinforcements within information bubbles and replies act as a space of direct debate. Also, discussions are seeded by public figures, but regular users carry on the debate per se. The topic modeling analyses revealed three observable user groups in this debate: strong supporters of the Brazilian government, progressive opposition to this government, and moderate users that oppose to this specific topic but do not reject the government agenda as a whole. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

Global public measures have been enacted to try to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. The trauma and orthopaedic (T&O) community has overcome challenges in order to continue to deliver acute trauma care to patients and plan for challenges ahead. This review explores the lessons learnt, the priorities and the controversies that the T&O community has faced during the crisis. Historically, the experience of major incidents in T&O has focused on mass casualty events. The current pandemic requires a different approach to resource management in order to create a long-term, system-sustaining model of care alongside a move towards resource balancing and facilitation. Significant limitations in theatre access, anaesthetists and bed capacity have necessitated adaptation. Strategic changes to trauma networks and risk mitigation allowed for ongoing surgical treatment of trauma. Outpatient care was reformed with the uptake of technology. The return to elective surgery requires careful planning, restructuring of elective pathways and risk management. Despite the hope that mass vaccination will lift the pressure on bed capacity and on bleak economic forecasts, the orthopaedic community must readjust its focus to meet the challenge of huge backlogs in elective caseloads before looking to the future with a robust strategy of integrated resilient pathways. The pandemic will provide the impetus for research that defines essential interventions and facilitates the implementation of strategies to overcome current barriers and to prepare for future crises.","Madanipour, S; Iranpour, F; Goetz, T; Khan, S",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,579,21

In the face of severely complex international trends and domestic and international economic conditions, artificial intelligence plays an important auxiliary role in the regular prevention and management of COVID-19. In order to effectively correspond to the formalized extensional prevention and control theory, it is essential to use coordination models, rule systems, prevention and control mechanisms, and governance landscapes to build artificial intelligence corresponding systems. This article uses a basic genetic algorithm to realize the robot path plan. This mainly includes the establishment of environmental models, the discovery of chromosomes and the determination of coding methods, the selection and design of fitness functions, and related designs. This paper proposes a new adaptive adjustment mode based on the basic genetic algorithm, which improves the selection and mutation operation, and improves the optimization efficiency of the genetic algorithm. Building an artificial intelligence response system may face various technical risks and governance dilemmas. Only by improving the rule system of artificial intelligence, creating an epidemic prevention and control ecology, conserving the public spirit of the whole people, strengthening the governance of the source of crisis, and further improving the new momentum of economic and social development and public safety.

However, once vaccine production starts, it will probably take time before there is enough vaccine for everyone, evoking the question how to distribute it best. While present vaccination guidelines largely focus on individual-based factors, i.e. on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first, e.g. to risk groups or to individuals with a strong social-mixing tendency, here we ask if a strategic spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines, e.g. to prioritize certain cities, can help to increase the overall survival rate of a population subject to an epidemic disease. To this end, we propose a strategy for the distribution of vaccines in time and space, which sequentially prioritizes regions with the most new cases of infection during a certain time frame and compare it with the standard practice of distributing vaccines demographically. Using a simple statistical model we find that, for a locally well-mixed population, the proposed strategy strongly reduces the number of deaths (by about a factor of two for basic reproduction numbers of [Formula: see text] and by about 35% for [Formula: see text]). The proposed vaccine distribution strategy establishes the idea that prioritizing individuals not only regarding individual factors, such as their risk of spreading the disease, but also according to the region in which they live can help saving lives. The suggested vaccine distribution strategy can be tested in more detailed models in the future and might inspire discussions regarding the importance of spatiotemporal distribution rules for vaccination guidelines.","Grauer, Jens; Löwen, Hartmut; Liebchen, Benno",Sci Rep,579,17

METHODS: Data on confirmed patients, with a final outcome reported as of 29 March 2020, were obtained from official websites and other internet sources. The hospitalized CFR (HCFR) was estimated, epidemiological features described, and risk factors for a fatal outcome identified. RESULTS: The overall HCFR in China was estimated to be 4.6% (95% CI 4.5-4.8%, P < 0.001). It increased with age and was higher in males than females. Although the highest HCFR observed was in male patients &#8805;70 years old, the relative risks for death outcome by sex varied across age groups, and the greatest HCFR risk ratio for males vs. females was shown in the age group of 50-60 years, higher than age groups of 60-70 and &#8805; 70 years. Differential age/sex HCFR patterns across geographical regions were found: the age effect on HCFR was greater in other provinces outside Hubei than in Wuhan. An effect of longer interval from symptom onset to admission was only observed outside Hubei, not in Wuhan. By performing multivariate analysis and survival analysis, the higher HCFR was associated with older age (both P < 0.001), and male sex (both P < 0.001). Only in regions outside Hubei, longer interval from symptom onset to admission, were associated with higher HCFR. CONCLUSIONS: This up-to-date and comprehensive picture of COVID-19 HCFR and its drivers will help healthcare givers target limited medical resources to patients with high risk of fatality.","Lu, Qing-Bin; Zhang, Hai-Yang; Che, Tian-Le; Zhao, Han; Chen, Xi; Li, Rui; Jiang, Wan-Li; Zeng, Hao-Long; Zhang, Xiao-Ai; Long, Hui; Wang, Qiang; Wu, Ming-Qing; Ward, Michael P; Chen, Yue; Zhang, Zhi-Jie; Yang, Yang; Fang, Li-Qun; Liu, Wei",BMC Infect Dis,579,21

The exponential increase in the number of cases has resulted in overcrowding of emergency departments (ED). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 is based on an RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab material. However, RT-PCR testing is time-consuming and many hospitals deal with a shortage of testing materials. Therefore, we aimed to develop an algorithm to rapidly evaluate an individual's risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the ED. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, routine laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts), demographic data and the chest X-ray/CT result from 967 patients entering the ED with respiratory symptoms were collected. Using these parameters, an easy-to-use point-based algorithm, called the corona-score, was developed to discriminate between patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and those testing negative. Computational sampling was used to optimize the corona-score. Validation of the model was performed using data from 592 patients. Results: The corona-score model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 in the validation population. Patients testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 showed a median corona-score of 3 vs. 11 (scale 0-14) in patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.001). Using cut-off values of 4 and 11 the model has a sensitivity and specificity of 96 and 95%, respectively. Conclusions: The corona-score effectively predicts SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR outcome based on routine parameters. This algorithm provides the means for medical professionals to rapidly evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infection status of patients presenting at the ED with respiratory symptoms.","Kurstjens, Steef; van der Horst, Armando; Herpers, Robert; Geerits, Mick W L; Kluiters-de Hingh, Yvette C M; Göttgens, Eva-Leonne; Blaauw, Martinus J T; Thelen, Marc H M; Elisen, Marc G L M; Kusters, Ron",Clin Chem Lab Med,579,20

This reflects, in part, the frailty and vulnerability of older people living in care homes but has also, in part, been a consequence of the failure to include care homes in the systematic planning of a response to COVID, as well as a measure of neglect of standards and quality improvement in the sector. In response, the EUGMS published a set of medical standards of care developed in consultation with experts across its member national societies in 2015. The standards consisted of seven core principles of medical care for physicians working in nursing homes as a first step in developing a programme of clinical, academic and policy engagement in improving medical care for older people who are living and frequently also dying as residents in nursing homes. The gravity of the concerns arising for nursing home care from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as emerging insights on care improvement in nursing homes indicate that an update of these medical standards is timely.

RECENT FINDINGS: Many mental health services remain too hospital-centric, often without adequate outreach services. On the basis of outcome evidence, we need to shift the balance of mental health services from hospital-centered with community outreach when convenient for staff, to community-centered and mobile, with in-reach to hospital only when necessary. Too few training programs those with emphasize the macroskills of public advocacy, working with service users, families, social movements, and the media to improve mental health and wellbeing of regional and local communities. SUMMARY: We should adopt a health ecosystems approach to mental healthcare and training, encompassing nano to macrolevels of service in every region. Catchment mental health services should be rebuilt as community-centric mental health services, integrating all community and inpatient components, but led and integrated from community sites. Community psychiatrists and mental health professionals of the future will need to be well trained in the nano to macroskills required to take responsibility for the mental health and wellbeing of their catchment communities and to provide leadership in service-planning, management, and continuing revision on the basis of rigorous evaluation. These approaches should be the core of all training in psychiatry and all mental health professions prior to any subspecialization.","Rosen, Alan; Gill, Neeraj S; Salvador-Carulla, Luis",Curr Opin Psychiatry,579,26

SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19, is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets or through direct and indirect contact with an infected person. The possibility of potential faecal-oral transmission was investigated in this study. We collected 258 faecal specimens from nine provinces in China and detected the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 using real-time RT-PCR. Vero cells were used to isolate the virus from SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive samples, after which sequencing of Spike gene in eight samples was performed. In all, 93 of 258 (36%) stool samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The positive rates of critical, severe, moderate, and mild patients were 54.4%, 56.1%, 30.8%, and 33.3%, respectively. The content of nucleic acid increased within 2 weeks after the onset of the disease. From the perspective of clinical typing, the nucleic acid can be detected in the faeces of critical patients within two weeks and until four to five weeks in the faeces of severe and mild patients. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from stool specimens of two severe patients. Four non-synonymous mutations in Spike gene were newly detected in three stool samples. A small number of patients had strong faecal detoxification ability. The live virus in faeces could be an important source of contamination, which may lead to infection and further spread in areas with poor sanitary conditions. The findings of this study have public health significance and they should be considered when formulating disease control strategies.","Zhang, Yong; Chen, Cao; Song, Yang; Zhu, Shuangli; Wang, Dongyan; Zhang, Hui; Han, Guangyue; Weng, Yuwei; Xu, Jun; Xu, Jianan; Yu, Pengbo; Jiang, Weijia; Yang, Xianda; Lang, Zhongkai; Yan, Dongmei; Wang, Yanhai; Song, Jingdong; Gao, George Fu; Wu, Guizhen; Xu, Wenbo",Emerg Microbes Infect,579,26

We first describe the mobility dynamics of the urban population as the process of leaving from home, traveling to and from the activity locations, and engaging in activities. We then embed the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) process over the mobility dynamics and develops the spatial SEIR model with travel contagion (Trans-SEIR), which explicitly accounts for contagions both during travel and during daily activities. We investigate the theoretical properties of the proposed model and show how activity contagion and travel contagion contribute to the average number of secondary infections. In the numerical experiments, we explore how the urban transportation system may alter the fundamental dynamics of the infectious disease, change the number of secondary infections, promote the synchronization of the disease across the city, and affect the peak of the disease outbreaks. The Trans-SEIR model is further applied to the understand the disease dynamics during the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City, where we show how the activity and travel contagion may be distributed and how effective travel control can be implemented with only limited resources. The Trans-SEIR model along with the findings in our study may have significant contributions to improving our understanding of the coupling between urban transportation and disease dynamics, the development of quarantine and control measures of disease system, and promoting the idea of disease-resilient urban transportation networks.","Qian, Xinwu; Ukkusuri, Satish V.",,579,21

They are not always evident but, once discovered, it seems obvious how to take advantage of them. In chemistry, the discovery of reproducible patterns stimulates the imagination to develop new functional materials and technological or medical applications. Two clear examples are helical structures at different levels in biological polymers as well as ring and spherical structures of different size and composition. Rings are intuitively observed as holes able to thread elongated structures. A large number of real and fictional stories have rings as inanimate protagonists. The design, development or just discovering of a special ring has often been taken as a symbol of power or success. Several examples are the Piscatory Ring wore by the Pope of the Catholic Church, the NBA Championship ring and the One Ring created by the Dark Lord Sauron in the epic story The Lord of the Rings. In this work, we reveal the power of another extremely powerful kind of rings to fight against the pandemic which is currently affecting the whole world. These rings are as small as ~1 nm of diameter and so versatile that they are able to participate in the attack of viruses, and specifically SARS-CoV-2, in a large range of different ways. This includes the encapsulation and transport of specific drugs, as adjuvants to stabilize proteins, vaccines or other molecules involved in the infection, as cholesterol trappers to destabilize the virus envelope, as carriers for RNA therapies, as direct antiviral drugs and even to rescue blood coagulation upon heparin treatment.

We reviewed the scans, collected medical history, and exposure information. RESULTS: Among the 13 scans, we identified 5 cases with imaging findings suspicious for viral infection. Peripheral lung consolidations and/or ground-glass opacities in two or more lobes were found. Lung abnormalities displayed increased [18F]FDG uptake (SUVmax 4.3-11.3). All the patients on the day of PET/CT acquisition were asymptomatic, and they did not have fever or cough. In view of the PET/CT findings, home isolation, symptom surveillance, and treatment (in 3/5 patients) were indicated. At 1-week follow-up, 2/5 patients experienced the onset of mild respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The [18F]FDG-PET/CT can identify probable Covid-19 disease in the absence or before symptoms onset and can guide patient management. Nuclear medicine staff needs to be aware of the possibility of contact with patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection even if they do not present any symptom.

The current study addressed whether prior experience with disease epidemics among the spine surgeon community had an impact on preparedness and response toward COVID-19. METHODS: A 73-item survey was distributed to spine surgeons worldwide via AO Spine. Questions focused on: demographics, COVID-19 preparedness, response, and impact. Respondents with and without prior epidemic experience (e.g., SARS, H1NI, MERS) were assessed on preparedness and response via univariate and multivariate modeling. Results of the survey were compared against the Global Health Security Index. RESULTS: Totally, 902 surgeons from 7 global regions completed the survey. 24.2% of respondents had prior experience with global health crises. Only 49.6% reported adequate access to personal protective equipment. There were no differences in preparedness reported by respondents with prior epidemic exposure. Government and hospital responses were fairly consistent around the world. Prior epidemic experience did not impact the presence of preparedness guidelines. There were subtle differences in sources of stress, coping strategies, performance of elective surgeries, and impact on income driven by prior epidemic exposure. 94.7% expressed a need for formal, international guidelines to help mitigate the impact of the current and future pandemics. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to note that prior experience with infectious disease crises did not appear to help spine surgeons prepare for the current COVID-19 pandemic. Based on survey results, the GHSI was not an effective measure of COVID-19 preparedness. Formal international guidelines for crisis preparedness are needed to mitigate future pandemics.","Weiner, Joseph A; Swiatek, Peter R; Johnson, Daniel J; Louie, Philip K; Harada, Garrett K; McCarthy, Michael H; Germscheid, Niccole; Cheung, Jason P Y; Neva, Marko H; El-Sharkawi, Mohammad; Valacco, Marcelo; Sciubba, Daniel M; Chutken, Norman B; An, Howard S; Samartzis, Dino",Eur Spine J,579,16

Biofilm formation was studied in vitro using a safranine biofilm assay and LIVE/DEAD staining. Moreover, we investigated what effect the AMP had on osseointegration of commercially available titanium implants in vivo, using a rabbit tibia model. The results showed a sustained release of AMP with equal or even better antibiofilm properties than the traditionally used antibiotic Cloxacillin. In addition, no negative effects on osseointegration in vivo was observed.

In this article, we review the role of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in the clinical management of COVID-19 and provide an overview of recent randomized controlled trial data evaluating nAbs in the ambulatory, hospitalized and prophylaxis settings. Two nAb cocktails (casirivimab/imdevimab and bamlanivimab/etesevimab) and one nAb monotherapy (bamlanivimab) have been granted Emergency Use Authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ambulatory patients who have a high risk of progressing to severe disease, and the European Medicines Agency has similarly recommended both cocktails and bamlanivimab monotherapy for use in COVID-19 patients who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. Efficacy of nAbs in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 has been varied, potentially highlighting the challenges of antiviral treatment in patients who have already progressed to severe disease. However, early data suggest a promising prophylactic role for nAbs in providing effective COVID-19 protection. We also review the risk of treatment-emergent antiviral resistant ""escape"" mutants and strategies to minimize their occurrence, discuss the susceptibility of newly emerging SARS-COV-2 variants to nAbs, as well as explore administration challenges and ways to improve patient access.","Hurt, A.

But three of these viruses cause more serious, acute diseases; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS by MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) by SARS-CoV and COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2. The current outbreak was classified by the WHO as a ""global public health emergency"". Despite all efforts to reduce the surgical lists and to cancel or postpone non-time-critical surgical interventions, some surgical and anesthetic interventions outside of intensive care medicine are still necessary and must be performed. This is particularly true for obstetric interventions and neuraxial labor analgesia. Workload in the delivery room is presumably not going to decrease and planned cesarean sections cannot be postponed. In the meantime, the clinical course and outcome of some COVID-19 patients with an existing pregnancy or peripartum courses have been reported. There are already numerous recommendations from national and international bodies regarding the care of such patients. Some of these recommendations will be summarized in this manuscript. The selection of aspects should by no means be seen as a form of prioritization. The general treatment principles in dealing with COVID-19 patients and the recommendations for action in intensive care therapy also apply to pregnant and postpartum patients. In this respect, there are naturally considerable redundancies and only a few aspects apply strictly or exclusively to the cohort of obstetric patients. In summary, at present it must be stated that the general care recommendations that also apply to non-COVID-19 patients are initially valid with regard to obstetric anesthesia. Nevertheless, the special requirements on the part of hygiene and infection protection result in special circumstances that should be taken into account when caring for pregnant patients from an anesthetic point of view. These relate to both medical aspects, but also to a particular extent logistics issues with regard to spatial separation, staffing and material resources.","Kranke, Peter; Weibel, Stephanie; Sitter, Magdalena; Meybohm, Patrick; Girard, Thierry",Anasthesiol Intensivmed Notfallmed Schmerzther,579,16

We aimed to explore health-related quality of life (QoL) in patients with haematological diseases during the early phase of the pandemic and their acceptability of using telehealth. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey among patients at the Department of Haematology, Odense University Hospital, Denmark. Eligible participants were patients receiving either active treatment or survivors in a follow-up program. The survey was open from 22 May to 13 June 2020. The survey contained questions on concerns and the impact of COVID-19 and acceptability on telehealth in addition to the assessment of health-related QoL. The later was assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer core QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire with the subdomains Global QoL, emotional functioning (EF) and social functioning (SF) being of primary interest. Further, anxiety during COVID-19 was assessed by use of an adapted version of the generalised anxiety disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire. RESULTS: 4420 patients were eligible to participate. The response rate was 53% (n = 2239) of which 37% where in a treatment program and 63% where in a follow-up program. The majority (80%) of patients were concerned about contracting COVID-19. The global QoL score (69.0, ±SD 22.6) was markedly lower than EF (84.5, ±SD 18.9) and SF (85.0, ±SD 23.4). Regression analysis showed that being concerned (a little, moderately, very, extremely) about contracting COVID-19 correlated with lower scores of global QoL (-3.86 to -22.76), EF (-3.81 to -26.41) and SF (-1.14 to -22.49). The GAD-7 score showed that approximately 20% of patients had symptoms of COVID-19 associated generalised anxiety. Finally, 67% of the patients were positive towards replacing face-to-face consultancies with phone calls, but video consultations were less preferred (47%). CONCLUSION: Danish patients with haematological cancer presented with low global QoL during the early phase of COVID-19, and 20% of the patients showed symptoms of generalised anxiety. Patients were overall positive towards the implementation of telehealth consultancies.","Ellehuus, Charlotte; Jeppesen, Stefan Starup; Eckhoff, Lise; Vestergaard, Hanne; Therkildsen, Ditte Naundrup; Frederiksen, Henrik; Eshoj, Henrik Rode",Acta Oncol,579,16

Ras is a key molecule that controls several tumorigenesis-related processes, and mutations in RAS genes often lead to unbiased intensification of signaling networks that fuel cancer progression. In this article, we review recent studies that describe mutant Ras-regulated signaling routes and their cross-talk. In addition to the two main Ras-driven signaling pathways, i.e., the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, we have also collected emerging data showing the importance of Ras in other signaling pathways, including the RAC/PAK, RalGDS/Ral, and PKC/PLC signaling pathways. Moreover, microRNA-regulated Ras-associated signaling pathways are also discussed to highlight the importance of Ras regulation in cancer. Finally, emerging data show that the signal alterations in specific cell types, such as cancer stem cells, could promote cancer development. Therefore, we also cover the up-to-date findings related to Ras-regulated signal transduction in cancer stem cells.","Takács, Tamás; Kudlik, Gyöngyi; Kurilla, Anita; Szeder, Bálint; Buday, László; Vas, Virag",Cancer metastasis. rev,579,27

As the second wave of the virus raged across the nation, there was a renewed effort to increase adherence to social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines. A community-based study led by members of the local National Black Nurses Association (NBNA) was conducted in a Midwest metropolitan city to identify barriers to mask-wearing experienced by business owners and employees in predominantly African American neighborhoods. Neighborhood business owners and their employees are essential to the life of a community as they provide needed goods and services from convenient neighborhood locations. Thus, attitudes and behaviors exhibited by business owners, supervisors, and other employees are important to combat COVID-19 in underserved communities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 39 business owners or supervising employees. Simple content analysis was used to identify codes and themes from the narrative data. Responses to the question 'What can make mask-wearing easier for your business and businesses in the neighborhood?' yielded three themes. Themes included 'a sense of community', the 'need for external support', and 'internal leadership'. These themes can be used to develop interventions to improve mask-wearing behaviors, support business owners and their customers, and lower the spread of COVID-19 in high-risk communities.","Jones, Holly J; Hutchins, Regina; Brown, Peggy; Crute, Sheeva; Ntumba, Linda; Ward, Carolyn",J. community health,579,16

In the current investigation an online questionnaire was distributed to 994 Scottish residents in order to identify travel habits, attitudes and preferences during the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and anticipated travel habits after the pandemic. Quota constraints were enforced for age, gender and household income to ensure the sample was representative of the Scottish population as a whole. Perceptions of risk, trust in information sources and compliance with COVID-19 regulations were determined together with changes in levels of life satisfaction and modal choice following the onset of COVID-19. In addition, survey responses were used to identify anticipated travel mode use in the future. Consideration was also given to the effects of COVID-19 on transport related lifestyle issues such as working from home, online shopping and the expectations of moving residences in the future. As part of the analysis, statistical models were developed to provide an insight into both the relationships between the levels of non compliance with COVID-19 regulations and demographic variables and the respondent attributes which might affect future public transport usage. In general, the study confirmed significant reductions in traffic activity, among respondents during the COVID-19 pandemic associated with walking, driving a car and either using a bus or train. The respondents also indicated that they anticipated they would continue to make less use of buses and trains at the end of the pandemic.","Downey, Lucy; Fonzone, Achille; Fountas, Grigorios; Semple, Torren",,579,13

Here, we propose an effective interface carrier transport mechanism: CsI:Na crystal and Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals (NCs) interface to form a new phase and a continuous heterostructure, providing an effective channel for X-ray excited carrier transfer to Cs4PbBr6. Then, the excited carriers realize efficient recombination luminescence through the self-trapped excitons inside Cs4PbBr6. On the basis of this mechanism, the heterostructure composite scintillator composed of CsI:Na/Cs4PbBr6 exhibits high-efficiency radiant fluorescence and an ultrafast photoluminescence (PL) decay time of 1.22 ns. The effective interface carrier transport shown in this work provides an optimization idea that can be used for reference in the research of fast scintillators.","Ding, Ying; Lin, Richeng; Liang, Yali; Zheng, Wei; Chen, Liang; Ouyang, Xiao; Ouyang, Xiaoping; Huang, Feng",J Phys Chem Lett,579,29

OBJECTIVES: We aim to investigate the incidence of causative viruses and pathogens in patients. STUDY DESIGN: We collected 191 nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with cold-like symptoms in Japan. All samples were subjected to multiplex PCR with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: FilmArray Respiratory Panel analysis detected at least one virus in 32 of 191 patients with cold-like symptoms (21 %). Of these, we frequently identified human rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (5.8 %, n=11), human metapneumovirus (3.7 %, n=7), coronavirus 229E (2.1 %, n=4) and coronavirus OC43 (1.6 %, n=3); while no influenza viruses were detected.

Even though respiratory failure is the cardinal form of severe COVID-19, concomitant cardiac involvement is common. Myocarditis is a challenging diagnosis due to heterogeneity of clinical presentation, ranging from mild symptoms to fatal arrhythmia and cardiogenic shock (CS). The aetiology is often viral and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is the gold standard for definite myocarditis. However, the diagnosis is often made on medical history, clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging, and blood tests. Case summary We present a 43-year-old man with mixed connective tissue disease treated with hydroxychloroquine who rapidly developed CS 4 days from symptom onset with fever and cough, showing positive polymerase chain reaction nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. While computed tomography of the thorax was normal, high-sensitivity troponin T was elevated and electrocardiogram showed diffuse ST elevation and low voltage as signs of myocardial oedema. Echocardiography showed severe depression of left ventricular function. The myocardium recovered completely after a week with mechanical circulatory support (MCS). EMB was performed but could neither identify the virus in the cardiomyocytes, nor signs of inflammation. Still the most probable aetiology of CS in this case is myocarditis as a sole symptom of COVID-19. Discussion COVID-19 patients in need of hospitalization present commonly with respiratory manifestations. We present the first case of fulminant myocarditis rapidly progressing to CS in a COVID-19 patient without respiratory failure, successfully treated with inotropes and MCS.","Papageorgiou, J.

We hypothesized that health messages might not receive the same user engagement on these media, although these messages were identical and distributed at the same time. METHODS: We measured the effect of health promotion messages on the risk of smoking among users of three social media sites (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram) and disseminated 1275 health messages between April 19 and July 12, 2017 (85 days). The identical messages were distributed at the same time and as organic (unpaid) and advertised (paid) messages, each including a link to an educational website with more information about the topic. Outcome measures included message engagement (ie, the click-through rate [CTR] of the social media messages) and educational website engagement (ie, the CTR on the educational website [wCTR]). To analyze the data and model relationships, we used mixed effects negative binomial regression, z-statistic, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. RESULTS: Comparisons between social media sites showed that CTRs for identical antitobacco health messages differed significantly across social media (P<.001 for all). Instagram showed the statistically significant highest overall mean message engagement (CTR=0.0037; 95% CI 0.0032-0.0042), followed by Facebook (CTR=0.0026; 95% CI 0.0022-0.0030) and Twitter (CTR=0.0015; 95% CI 0.0013-0.0017). Facebook showed the highest as well as the lowest CTR for any individual message. However, the message CTR is not indicative of user engagement with the educational website content. Pairwise comparisons of the social media sites differed with respect to the wCTR (P<.001 for all). Messages on Twitter showed the lowest CTR, but they resulted in the highest level of website engagement (wCTR=0.6308; 95% CI 0.5640-0.6975), followed by Facebook (wCTR=0.2213; 95% CI 0.1932-0.2495) and Instagram (wCTR=0.0334; 95% CI 0.0230-0.0438). We found a statistically significant higher CTR for organic (unpaid) messages (CTR=0.0074; 95% CI 0.0047-0.0100) compared with paid advertisements (CTR=0.0022; 95% CI 0.0017-0.0027; P<.001 and P<.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence-based insights to guide the design of health promotion efforts on social media. Future studies should examine the platform-specific impact of psycholinguistic message variations on user engagement, include newer sites such as Snapchat and TikTok, and study the correlation between web-based behavior and real-world health behavior change. The need is urgent in light of increased health-related marketing and misinformation on social media.","Reuter, Katja; Wilson, Melissa L; Moran, Meghan; Le, NamQuyen; Angyan, Praveen; Majmundar, Anuja; Kaiser, Elsi M; Unger, Jennifer B",JMIR Public Health Surveill,579,16

In addition, people’s outdoor activities have been limited, making it more difficult to find outlets for releasing stress. Under this situation, some people began to experience emotions of anxiety and depression. This article reports a case of depression with fever caused by the stress tension of the pandemic. The patient was highly suspected to have contracted COVID-19. The reported patient, who had a history of depression and had been to Wuhan to attend an exam, showed obvious pre-exam anxiety under the epidemic situation, which gradually increased the patient's pressure and then caused some adverse symptoms, such as insomnia, anxiety, sweating and a reoccurrent fever. Local community authorities paid close attention to him and later sent him to a general hospital in Jingmen for quarantine and treatment, as he was suspected of having COVID-19. After being hospitalised for half a month, he was ruled out from having ‘COVID-19’ and was cured of depression and discharged from the hospital. From this case, we can realise that, under the situation of the epidemic, people are easily prone to insomnia, anxiety and even depression. As clinicians in general hospitals, especially when encountering large emergencies, we must carefully inquire about the patient’s medical history while strengthening our understanding of psychiatric knowledge to improve the recognition rate for depression.","Fu, Rui; Zhang, Yueqin",General Psychiatry,579,6

Thus, there is an urgent need to search for various possible strategies including nutritional supplementation. In this study, we have tried to provide a reference for protein supplementation. Specifically, 20 marine fish proteins were subjected to in silico hydrolysis by gastrointestinal enzymes, and a large number of active peptides were generated. Then, the binding abilities of these peptides to SARS-CoV-2 main protease and monoamine oxidase A were assessed. The results showed that NADH dehydrogenase could be a good protein source in generating potent binders to the two enzymes, followed by cytochrome b. In addition, some high-affinity oligopeptides (VIQY, ICIY, PISQF, VISAW, AIPAW, and PVSQF) were identified as dual binders to the two enzymes. In summary, the supplementation of some fish proteins can be helpful for COVID-19 patients; the identified oligopeptides can be used as the lead compounds to design potential inhibitors against COVID-19 and anxiety.","Yao, Yushan; Luo, Zhen; Zhang, Xuewu",Food Funct,579,15

Evidences have indicated that the efficiency of emergency response was considered crucial to curb the spread of the emerging infectious disease. However, studies of COVID-19 on this topic are relatively few. METHODS: A qualitative comparative study was conducted to compare the timeline of emergency responses to H1N1 (2009) and COVID-19, by using a set of six key time nodes selected from international literature. Besides, we also explored the spread speed and peak time of COVID-19 and H1N1 swine influenza by comparing the confirmed cases in the same time interval. RESULTS: The government's entire emergency responses to the epidemic, H1N1 swine influenza (2009) completed in 28 days, and COVID-19 (2019) completed in 46 days. Emergency responses speed for H1N1 was 18 days faster. As for the epidemic spread speed, the peak time of H1N1 came about 4 weeks later than that of COVID-19, and the H1N1 curve in America was flatter than COVID-19 in China within the first four months after the disease emerged. CONCLUSIONS: The speed of the emergency responses to H1N1 was faster than COVID-19, which might be an important influential factor for slowing down the arrival of the peak time at the beginning of the epidemic. Although COVID-19 in China is coming to an end, the government should improve the public health emergency system, in order to control the spread of the epidemic and lessen the adverse social effects in possible future outbreaks.","Wang, Qian; Zhang, Tiantian; Zhu, Huanhuan; Wang, Ying; Liu, Xin; Bai, Ge; Dai, Ruiming; Zhou, Ping; Luo, Li",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),579,20

A scoping review was performed, where 10 papers were identified as specifically addressing the assessment of timing of commensality of meals. Time use studies, questionnaires, and telephone- and person-to-person interviews were used for assessing meal times in relation to commensality. Four of the studies used a method of time use registration, and six papers used interviews or questionnaires. Common meals with family members were the most common, and dinners late at night were often preferred for commensal activities among the working population. In conclusion, the family meal seemed to be the most important commensal meal. It is clear from the collected papers and from previous systematic reviews that more studies of commensal meals in general and about timing aspects in particular and in relation to nutritional health are essential to provide a solid background of knowledge regarding the importance of timing in relation to commensal meals.","Scander, Henrik; Lennernäs Wiklund, Maria; Yngve, Agneta",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),579,24

A typical feature of COVID-19 is the suppression of type I and III interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immunity. However, the molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 evades antiviral immunity remains elusive. Here, we reported that the SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein inhibits the production of type I and III IFNs induced by the cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathway mediated by RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS signaling. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein suppresses type I and III IFN induction stimulated by SeV infection or poly (I:C) transfection. Mechanistically, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein interacts with RIG-I, MAVS, and TBK1, thus preventing the formation of the multiprotein complex containing RIG-I, MAVS, TRAF3, and TBK1 and subsequently impeding the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and activation of IRF3. Consequently, ectopic expression of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein facilitates the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus. Taken together, these results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 M protein antagonizes type I and III IFN production by targeting RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling, which subsequently attenuates antiviral immunity and enhances viral replication. This study provides insight into the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2-induced antiviral immune suppression and illuminates the pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19.","Zheng, Yi; Zhuang, Meng-Wei; Han, Lulu; Zhang, Jing; Nan, Mei-Ling; Zhan, Peng; Kang, Dongwei; Liu, Xinyong; Gao, Chengjiang; Wang, Pei-Hui",Signal Transduct Target Ther,579,20

To play such diverse roles, the N protein has two structured RNA-binding modules, the N- (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) domains, which are connected by an intrinsically disordered region. Despite the wealth of structural data available for the isolated NTD and CTD, how these domains are arranged in the full-length protein and how the oligomerization of N influences its RNA-binding activity remains largely unclear. Herein, using experimental data from electron microscopy and biochemical/biophysical techniques combined with molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that, in the absence of RNA, the N protein forms structurally dynamic dimers with the NTD and CTD arranged in extended conformations. In the presence of RNA, however, the N protein assumes a more compact conformation where the NTD and CTD are packed together. We also provide an octameric model for the full-length N bound to RNA that is consistent with electron microscopy images of the N protein in the presence of RNA. Together, our results shed new light on the dynamics and higher-order oligomeric structure of this versatile protein.","Ribeiro-Filho, Helder Veras; Jara, Gabriel Ernesto; Batista, Fernanda Aparecida Heleno; Schleder, Gabriel Ravanhani; Tonoli, Celisa Caldana; Soprano, Adriana Santos; Guimaraes, Samuel Leite; Borges, Antonio Carlos; Cassago, Alexandre; Bajgelman, Marcio Chaim; Marques, Rafael Elias; Trivella, Daniela Barrreto Barbosa; Franchini, Kleber Gomes; Figueira, Ana Carolina Migliorini; Benedetti, Celso Eduardo; Lopes-de-Oliveira, Paulo Sergio",,579,16

Elective surgical procedures were put on hold to prevent the spread of the virus, reduce exposure risk of staff, and potentially repurpose ORs for critical care areas. Interventional radiology (IR) suites were largely kept open for all procedures (emergent or elective) with changes focused on workflow, PPE, and room sanitation between procedures. Previous single-hospital study showed a large reduction in IR procedure volume over a span of 4-weeks. Here, we explore the effect of COVID-19 on procedure volume in a multi-hospital analysis over the course of months. Materials and Methods: Case load in 3 URMC-affiliated hospitals during a 4-months period before and after the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed. Procedure types and context (inpatient, outpatient, or emergency) were recorded for all procedures. CT-guided procedures, angiograms, and venograms were grouped together. Procedure volume was calculated as a percentage of all procedures, and differences per month were compared between pre-COVID and COVID months using two-tailed t-test with significance set at P&lt; 0.05. Results: A total of 7159 procedures were performed over the eight-month period (November 2019–June 2020). There was a significant reduction in procedures per month after the onset of the COVID pandemic from 1005 to 838 (P = 0.023). When analyzing volume of individual procedures, there was a significant reduction in volume of common procedures, such as Mediport discontinuations (P = 0.035) and ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsies (P = 0.027). There was an increase in volume of procedures shared with other specialties, such as angiograms (P = 0.045) and paracenteses (P = 0.005). More complex procedures, such as TIPS or tumor ablations did not reflect a significant change in volume. There was a significant decrease in volume of emergency room procedures (P = 0.011) and a significant increase in volume of inpatient procedures (P = 0.016);changes in outpatient procedures were not significant. Conclusions: Across 3 hospitals in the URMC network, there was an overall reduction in monthly procedure volume after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As expected, common elective procedures experienced a decrease in volume during the COVID-19 months. However, IR continues to demonstrate its value during the COVID-19 pandemic as a minimally invasive specialty, seeing an overall increases in inpatient volume and procedures commonly shared with other specialties.","Meng, S.; Lee, D.; Cantos, A.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,579,1

However, direct measurements of the vagal control are difficult. The novel deceleration capacity (DC) of heart rate measure has been used to characterize the vagal modulation. This study aimed to assess vagal control in VVS patients and evaluate the diagnostic value of the DC in VVS. Methods - Altogether 161 consecutive VVS patients (43 ± 15 years; 62 males) were enrolled. Tilt table test (TTT) was positive in 101 and negative in 60 patients. Sixty-five healthy subjects were enrolled as controls. DC and heart rate variability (HRV) in 24-hour electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and biochemical examinations were compared between the syncope and control groups. Results - DC was significantly higher in the syncope group than in the control group (9.6 ± 3.3 ms vs. 6.5 ± 2.0 ms, P0.001). DC was similarly increased in VVS patients with a positive and negative TTT (9.7±3.5 ms and 9.4±2.9 ms, P=0.614). In multivariable logistic regression analyses, DC was independently associated with syncope (OR=1.518, 95% CI 1.301-1.770, P =0.0001). For the prediction of syncope, the area under curve (AUC) analysis showed similar values when comparing single DC and combined DC with other risk factors (P=0.1147). From the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for syncope discrimination, the optimal cut-off value for the DC was 7.12 ms. Conclusion - DC > 7.5 ms may serve as a good tool to monitor cardiac vagal activity and discriminate VVS, particularly in those with negative TTT.","Zheng, Lihui; Sun, Wei; Liu, Shangyu; Liang, Erpeng; Du, Zhongpeng; Guo, Jingrui; Wu, Lingmin; Asirvatham, Samuel J; Yao, Yan",Circ.

We studied post-lockdown scenarios and evaluated health-care constraints. Our aim was to identify the scenarios in which health-care availability would not be overwhelmed. Methods: A modified compartmental SEIR stochastic model was used to calculate peak cases at various levels of effectiveness of prevention of transmission. Health-care constraints were evaluated using a Delphi study. We developed ""q-metric"" to evaluate the epidemic. Key constraints were matched against scenarios generated, and a monitoring mechanism was devised. Results: Continuing lockdown (""q-metric"" of >50) until mid-August was theoretically the most effective solution to end the epidemic. Lockdown might however be lifted earlier owing to various compulsions. The key constraints were identified as trained manpower and ventilators. It was estimated that shortfall of specialists to operate ventilators for COVID-19 intensive care units was approximately 40,000. This requires re-purposing of other specialists and short-term training to meet the surge. The shortage of ventilators is around 40,000-50,000. Procuring beyond those numbers would be infructuous owing to limits of training manpower. After lifting lockdown, the aim should be to contain the epidemic within the availability of key constraints. Our model suggests that this can be achieved by community containment and other non-pharmacological interventions at a ""q-metric"" of 19. An algorithm using ""q-metric"" was developed to monitor the epidemic. Conclusion: Various post-lockdown scenarios were simulated. Trained manpower and ventilators were identified as key health-care constraints. Partial community containment measures will require to be continued after the current lockdown is lifted.","Chatterjee, Kaushik; Shankar, Subramanian; Chatterjee, Kaustuv; Yadav, Arun Kumar",,579,16

Part of these active learning activities using a gamification process were presented last year together with student assessments (EB 2020 poster: Tejada-Simon and Silverthorn;?Low-tech? gamification and TBL strategies to teach physiology). With the current COVID-19 pandemic, we had to transform the newly developed TBL and game session to a new and engaging system for the online world. The task required more effort than originally predicted, as instructors were trying to learn new technological skills at the same time than developing new materials. The goals for those new materials were to conserve equivalency and reusability for future academic years, as well as possible application to all, face-to-face, hyflex, hybrid and online delivery systems. Our learning objective was to assist first year Pharmacy students in understanding the autonomic nervous system structure and function using an interactive approach coupled to a team-based learning session. The original 2-hour session was converted to a 3-hour interactive problem-solving game (InProGAME). As in prior years, the students completed pre-class activities in form of diagrams, crossword puzzles and fill-in the blank to engage them with anatomical terminology and function. During the InProGAME, the whole class (123 students) met first in a Zoom room to discuss foundational learning, followed by 15 breakout Zoom rooms with eight students/group to facilitate small group interaction and initiate the collaborative/active learning part of the session. Group learning activities mainly included the use of Jamboards and Wisc-Online, with instructor facilitation. Jamboard is an interactive whiteboard system with compatibility for online collaboration and more capabilities than Google docs. Students worked together in real time using these boards with instructor supervision and feedback.

There is no question that the current global COVID-19 crisis, now more than ever, is underscoring the importance of leveraging digital approaches to optimize pediatric health care delivery in the era of this pandemic. In this perspective piece, we highlight some of the available digital approaches that have been and can continue to be used to streamline remote pediatric patient care in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to telemedicine. JMIR Pediatrics and Parenting is currently publishing a COVID-19 special theme issue in which investigators can share their interim and final research data related to digital approaches to remote pediatric health care delivery in different settings. The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly transformed health care systems worldwide, with significant variations and innovations in adaptation. There has been rapid expansion of the leveraging and optimization of digital approaches to health care delivery, particularly integrated telemedicine and virtual health. Digital approaches have played and will play major roles as invaluable and reliable resources to overcome restrictions and challenges imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic and to increase access to effective, accessible, and consumer-friendly care for more patients and families. However, a number of challenges remain to be addressed, and further research is needed. Optimizing digital approaches to health care delivery and integrating them into the public health response will be an ongoing process during the current COVID-19 outbreak and during other possible future pandemics. Regulatory changes are essential to support the safe and wide adoption of these approaches. Involving all relevant stakeholders in addressing current and future challenges as well as logistical, technological, and financial barriers will be key for success. Future studies should consider evaluating the following research areas related to telemedicine and other digital approaches: cost-effectiveness and return on investment; impact on quality of care; balance in use and number of visits needed for the management of both acute illness and chronic health conditions; system readiness for further adoption in other settings, such as inpatient services, subspecialist consultations, and rural areas; ongoing user-centered evaluations, with feedback from patients, families, and health care providers; strategies to optimize health equity and address disparities in access to care related to race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, immigration status, and rural communities; privacy and security concerns for protected health information with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-secured programs; confidentiality issues for some specific populations, especially adolescents and those in need of mental health services; early detection of exposure to violence and child neglect; and integration of training into undergraduate and graduate medical education and subspecialty fellowships. Addressing these research areas is essential to understanding the benefits, sustainability, safety, and optimization strategies of telemedicine and other digital approaches as key parts of modern health care delivery. These efforts will inform long-term adoption of these approaches with expanded dissemination and implementation efforts.","Badawy, Sherif M; Radovic, Ana",JMIR Pediatr Parent,579,16

In this literature review, we have focused on the known and postulated mechanisms of action of omega-3 PUFAs and their metabolites on various components of the haemostatic system, in particular on blood platelets and endothelium. We have also made an attempt to provide a comprehensive review of epidemiological studies with particular regard to clinical trials. Notably, the results of these studies are contradictory, and some of them failed to report the beneficial effects of taking or supplementing omega-3 PUFAs in the diet. A potential explanation, in our opinion, could be the need to use higher doses of omega-3 PUFAs and a proper ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs. An additional problem which is difficult to solve is the use of a proper neutral placebo for interventional studies. Despite some controversies regarding the beneficial effects of supplementation of omega-3 PUFAs in cardiovascular disease, our review suggests that a promising aspect of future studies and applications is to focus on the anti-thrombotic properties of these compounds. An argument supporting this assumption is the recent use of omega-3 PUFAs as a supporting tool for the treatment of COVID-19 complications.","Golanski, Jacek; Szymanska, Patrycja; Rozalski, Marcin",Int. j. mol. sci.

Modelling studies published since the COVID 19 pandemic was declared in March 2020 estimate that suicide rates will increase by anywhere between 1% to 145% globally in response to the pandemic and action needs to be taken. METHODS: A narrative literature review on high quality evidence sources limited to human studies and publications written in English language only has been used to examine the relationship of COVID 19 and existing mental illness or history of mental illness, suicide prevention strategies and changes in overall suicide rates. RESULTS: A total of 39 papers are summarised and grouped using the headings aetiological factors, proposed interventions to increase access and national policies to provide a framework for suicide prevention during pandemics such as COVID 19. This review indicates that 1) investing in active labour market programmes will result in a decreased suicide rate during times of high unemployment 2) People in low paid and casual jobs require specific support because they are most financially vulnerable during a pandemic related crisis 3) Women require specific support during a pandemic because of the type of employment they have and because they often carry a greater proportion of the domestic burden and are at increased risk of domestic violence during lockdown and crisis 4) Mental health and substance misuse services need to be appropriately funded and prioritised during and post pandemic, due to the associated increase in substance misuse during a pandemic causing worsening mental health and increased risk of suicide 5) National Suicide Prevention Strategies should be developed by all countries and should anticipate response to a range of disasters, including a pandemic 6) Suicide prevention is everybody's business and National Suicide Prevention Strategies should adopt a whole-systems approach including mental health services, primary care, social care, NGO's and other community stakeholders 7) Suicide is preventable 8) It is essential to prioritise suicide prevention strategies in the COVID and post-COVID period to ensure that lives are saved.

So far, there is no reliable scientific basis for forecasting and preventing pandemics. Around the world, there is public dissatisfaction with the authorities' insufficiently prompt and effective actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The purpose of the study is the formulation a significant problem of the complexity and effectiveness of the operational protective measures for the health and life of the population from COVID-19 in other epidemics and pandemics. Material and methods. Based on the application of a systematic approach and the international methodology for the policy analysis, the author proposes the structuring of the emergency measures and the subjects of the socio-psychological factors analysis of the epidemics and the pandemics to determine a system of the quantitative indicators and the monitoring of the situation. Results. During the epidemics and the pandemics, it is necessary to take emergency measures and also to strive to prevent them based on an in-depth study of the causal relationships, in particular, the risks of the recurrence as a result of the increased traffic flows, urbanization, agricultural intensification, environmental degradation and the continued development of new species biological weapons. Discussion. Among the topical areas, it should be attributed the application of the restrictive measures both on the international and domestic air travel;the limiting the increase in population density in large cities with a focus on the standards of «social isolation»;more the adequate environmental protection, the reducing the risk of the infection transmission from the animals to the humans;the reduction of people infections with nosocomial infections.

However, there is a dearth of information regarding the impact of COVID-19 in patients with tuberculosis, HIV, chronic hepatitis, and other concurrent infections. This review was conducted to evaluate the consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with concurrent co-infections based on the publications reported to date. An extensive comprehensive screening was conducted using electronic databases up to 3rd September 2020 after obtaining registration with PROSPERO (CRD420202064800). The observational studies or interventional studies in English, evaluating the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with concurrent infections are included for the meta-analyses. Our search retrieved 20 studies, with a total of 205,702 patients. Patients with tuberculosis (RR = 2.10; 95% CI, 1.75-2.51; I2 = 0%), influenza (RR = 2.04; 95% CI, 0.15-28.25, I2 = 99%) have an increased risk of mortality during a co-infection with SARS-CoV-2. No significant impact is found in people living with HIV (RR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.82-1.19; I2 = 30%), Chronic hepatitis (RR = 1.15; 95% CI, 0.73-1.81; I2 = 10%).

This review elaborates on disorders of the spinal cord caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. OBJECTIVES: To review the published data about SARS-CoV-2-associated spinal cord disorders and assess their clinical, neuroimaging, treatment, and prognostic aspects. METHODS: The PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched for published cases using the search items ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND myelitis"", ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND myelopathy"", and ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND spinal cord"". RESULTS: Thirty-three isolated cases were included in the present review, of which 14 were aged 60 years and above (range: 3-70 years). Eighteen patients had lung abnormalities on chest imaging. Eight patients had developed either an areflexic paraparesis or quadriparesis. In 17 patients, neuroimaging demonstrated longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, while 3 cases showed neuroimaging changes in the spinal cord as a part of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis syndrome. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations revealed inflammatory changes in 18 patients. However, the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the CSF was discovered in 2 patients. In 2 patients, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were demonstrated in the CSF. Following treatment, 13 patients were able to walk. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of COVID-19-related spinal cord manifestations, such as acute transverse myelitis, acute necrotizing myelitis, SARS-CoV-2 myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, hypoxic myelopathy, MOG antibody-associated myelitis, spinal cord infarction, and spinal epidural abscess, have been reported. The possible mechanisms of this involvement being direct invasion, cytokine storm, coagulopathy, and an autoimmune response.

The symptoms of a COVID-19 infection are usually mild in the healthy population below the age of 65;however, the measures laid down to prevent the spread of the virus apply typically to the whole population. Hence, those who have a low risk of severe symptoms face a social dilemma in cooperating and complying with the safety measures: Cooperating in preventing the spread of the disease is good for society but comes with individual costs. These costs provide an incentive not to cooperate with the safety measures. In this paper we analyze via structural equation modelling a sample of young adults (N = 510) who were surveyed right after the end of the first lockdown period in Switzerland. We investigate why and to what extent they cooperated in preventing the epidemic by following the recommendation to stay at home as much as possible. We hypothesize that those respondents who perceive themselves to be personally at risk, or who have relatives belonging to the risk group, complied more often with the safety measures as compared to those without severe risks. Cooperating should also be linked to individuals' pro-social orientation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that those who believe that the virus is dangerous for society or who have a personal interest in protection show higher support for the general safety measures. Our empirical results show that compliance with the coronavirus social distancing measures was generally very high during the first lockdown. Although young adults perceived themselves to be at low personal risk, they still believed that the virus is dangerous for society. Those who had a personal interest in staying at home because they had relatives belonging to the risk group complied more often with the safety measures. Overall, the results suggest that the support of the preventive measures is the most important promoter of cooperation to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","Franzen, A.; Wohner, F.",PLoS ONE,579,8

A major underutilized source to address these serious challenges in the US is community pharmacy given the specialized training of pharmacists, high levels of consumer trust, and general availability for accessing these service settings. Canadian, Australian, and European pharmacists have made important contributions to the treatment and care of those with OUD over the past decades. Unfortunately, US pharmacists are not permitted to prescribe MOUD and are only currently allowed to dispense methadone for the treatment of pain, not OUD.

The aim of this study is to evaluate three immunocromathographic assays (Sienna®, Wondfo® and Prometheus®) for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum samples, considering RT-qPCR as a reference. A total of 145 serum samples from 145 patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 were collected: all of the samples were tested with Sienna®, 117 with Wondfo® and 89 with Prometheus®. The overall results of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value obtained were as follows: 64.4%, 75%, 85.5% and 47.8% with Sienna®; 45.2%, 81.8%, 80.5% and 47.4% with Wondfo® and 75.5%, 12.5%, 51.4% and 29.4% with Prometheus®. The accuracy of the test for Sienna®, Wondfo® and Prometheus® was 67.6%, 59% and 47.2%, with a prevalence of COVID-19 of 69.7%, 62.4% and 55.1% respectively. Sensitivity of the three tests (Sienna®, Wondfo® and Prometheus® respectively) along the three different stages was 36.6%, 18.8% and 68.6% in the early stage (first week); 81.3%, 74.1% and 90.9% in the intermediate stage (second week) and 100%, 83.3% and 100% in the late stage (third week). The results demonstrate that even though Prometheus® presented a high sensitivity, the specificity was notably lower than the other two tests. Sienna® showed the greatest contrast between sensitivity and specificity, achieving the best accuracy, followed by Wondfo®. The sensitivity of the three ICT assays was higher in late stages of the disease.","Guedez-López, Gladys Virginia; Alguacil-Guillén, Marina; González-Donapetry, Patricia; Bloise, Ivan; Tornero-Marin, Carolina; González-García, Juan; Mingorance, Jesus; García-Rodríguez, Julio",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,579,16

Direct farmer access to extension services was limited due to travel restrictions and banning of public gatherings. The overall objective of the study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on agricultural extension and food supply as well as the effectiveness of the suggested coping strategies in Zimbabwe. A structured questionnaire was administered to 100 Agriculture extension officers through phone interviews in adherence to the COVID-19 regulations of minimizing close contact to reduce transmission. Key informant interviews were conducted through phone calls and emails. The study revealed that agricultural extension and food supply was grossly affected by COVID-19. Use of social groups for communication during lockdown helps to reduce spread of COVID-19. Researchers recommend the development of online marketing strategies where people can make orders of various produce and become booked for purchases or deliveries during a specified time range.

Here, we show that this three-step modification pathway exists in Dictyostelium discoideum, model of the evolutionary superfamily Amoebozoa. Not only are previously established modifications observable by mass spectrometry in strains with the most conserved genes of each step deleted, but also additional modifications are detected, indicating a certain plasticity of the pathway in the amoeba. Unlike described for yeast, D. discoideum allows for an unconditional deletion of the single tQCUG gene, as long as the Elongator-dependent modification pathway is intact. In gene deletion strains of the modification pathway, protein amounts are significantly reduced as shown by flow cytometry and Western blotting, using strains expressing different glutamine leader constructs fused to GFP. Most dramatic are these effects, when the tQCUG gene is deleted, or Elp3, the catalytic component of the Elongator complex is missing. In addition, Elp3 is the most strongly conserved protein of the modification pathway, as our phylogenetic analysis reveals. The implications of this observation are discussed with respect to the evolutionary age of the components acting in the Elongator-dependent modification pathway.","Schäck, Manfred A; Jablonski, Kim Philipp; Gräf, Stefan; Klassen, Roland; Schaffrath, Raffael; Kellner, Stefanie; Hammann, Christian",Nucleic acids res,579,14

Misspecified beliefs about time lags result in attribution errors, which have no long-term effect when the agent's action converges, but can lead to arbitrarily large long-term inefficiencies when his action cycles. Our proof uses concentration inequalities to bound the frequency of action switches, which are useful to study learning problems with history dependence. We apply our methods to study a policy choice game between a policy-maker who has a correctly specified belief about the time lag and the public who has a misspecified belief.","Li, Yingkai; Pei, Harry",,579,32

Therefore, we developed a tsunami evacuation placement model incorporating physical distance guidelines for infection control and living space per person into calculations of evacuation center accommodation capacities in Aki City, Kochi Prefecture. Using available administrative, population, and tsunami inundation data, we counted and mapped evacuation centers in the estimated inundated area within three zones constructed for smooth evacuation using the ArcGIS software Build Balanced Zones Tool. We calculated the space per evacuee using the Sphere handbook standard of 3.5 m2 or double the Sphere standard at 7 m2 plus the recommended physical distance of 11 m2 per person. We then compared the results with planned capacities. A total of 27 shelters are located in the area projected to be inundated at depths of 0.3–10 m, and their planned capacity, 2 m2 for each evacuee, would accommodate 32.9% of Aki's population and result in 9639 unaccommodated evacuees. Allotting 14.5 m2 (living space) or 18 m2 (living space plus space to maintain physical distancing) would reduce accommodation capacities to 57.1% and 28.6% (12,133 and 12,371 unaccommodated evacuees, respectively).

Although it has not been widely used in outpatient neurosurgery settings, the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has necessitated a broader adoption. Our goal is to show the level of patient satisfaction with their telemedicine care. METHODS: We prospectively studied consecutive telemedicine patients who scheduled outpatient neurosurgery visits from May 15 to June 8, 2020. Patients were seen by the surgeon via real-time video conferencing using Google Meet, and then completed a telemedicine satisfaction survey. Our primary outcome was telemedicine satisfaction scores. We compared satisfaction scores between new and established patients and between patients within and outside of a 15-mile radius of the nearest clinic location. Sensitivity analyses were performed to account for the nonrespondents. Descriptive and univariate analyses were performed. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Five-hundred and ninety patients completed a telemedicine visit during the study period. One patient from out of state was excluded. Three-hundred and ten patients (52.6%) responded. The average age was 60.9 ± 13.60 years; 59% were female, 20.6% were new patients; the average distance to the clinic was 28.03 ± 36.09 km (17.42 ± 22.43 miles). The mean overall satisfaction score was 6.32 ± 1.27. Subgroup analyses by new/established patient status and distance from their home to the clinic showed no significant difference in mean satisfaction scores between groups.

COVID-19 is caused by the Betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is highly expressed in the human lower respiratory tract but also in other tissues, as the cellular entry receptor. Thus, COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system but can cause damage to other body systems, including the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, renal, and central nervous systems. We review the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of the infection, focusing on our current understanding of the disease mechanisms and their translation to clinical outcomes, as well as adverse effects on different body systems. We also discuss the epidemiology pathogenesis, clinical, and multi-organ consequences, and highlight some of the research gaps regarding COVID-19.","Krishnan, Arunkumar; Hamilton, James P; Alqahtani, Saleh A; A Woreta, Tinsay",Intern. emerg. med,579,1

Human IFIT1 binds to cap0 (m7GpppN) RNA, which lacks methylation on the first and second cap-proximal nucleotides (cap1, m7GpppNm, and cap2, m7GpppNmNm, respectively). These modifications are signatures of ""self"" in higher eukaryotes, whereas unmodified cap0-RNA is recognized as foreign and, therefore, potentially harmful to the host cell. IFIT1 inhibits translation at the initiation stage by competing with the cap-binding initiation factor complex, eIF4F, restricting infection by certain viruses that possess ""nonself"" cap0-mRNAs. However, in mice and other rodents, the IFIT1 orthologue has been lost, and the closely related Ifit1b has been duplicated twice, yielding three paralogues: Ifit1, Ifit1b, and Ifit1c. Although murine Ifit1 is similar to human IFIT1 in its cap0-RNA-binding selectivity, the roles of Ifit1b and Ifit1c are unknown. Here, we found that Ifit1b preferentially binds to cap1-RNA, whereas binding is much weaker to cap0- and cap2-RNA. In murine cells, we show that Ifit1b can modulate host translation and restrict WT mouse coronavirus infection. We found that Ifit1c acts as a stimulatory cofactor for both Ifit1 and Ifit1b, promoting their translation inhibition. In this way, Ifit1c acts in an analogous fashion to human IFIT3, which is a cofactor to human IFIT1. This work clarifies similarities and differences between the human and murine IFIT families to facilitate better design and interpretation of mouse models of human infection and sheds light on the evolutionary plasticity of the IFIT family.","Mears, Harriet V; Sweeney, Trevor R",J Biol Chem,579,20

Molecular hydrogen (H2) can selectively eliminate ·OH generated inside of the mitochondria. Inflammation is induced by the release of proinflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages and neutrophils. However, an uncontrolled or exaggerated response often occurs, resulting in severe inflammation that can lead to acute or chronic inflammatory diseases. Recent studies have reported that ROS activate NLRP3 inflammasomes, and that this stimulation triggers the production of proinflammatory cytokines. It has been shown in literature that H2 can be based on the mechanisms that inhibit mitochondrial ROS. However, the ability for H2 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation via mitochondrial oxidation is poorly understood. In this review, we hypothesize a possible mechanism by which H2 inhibits mitochondrial oxidation. Medical applications of H2 may solve the problem of many chronic inflammation-based diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Hirano, Shin-Ichi; Ichikawa, Yusuke; Sato, Bunpei; Yamamoto, Haru; Takefuji, Yoshiyasu; Satoh, Fumitake",Int. j. mol. sci.

It was conducted based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). Criteria for eligibility were all published population-based primary literature in PubMed interface and the Science Direct, dealing with incubation period of COVID-19, written in English, since December 2019 to December 2020. We estimated the mean of the incubation period using meta-analysis, taking into account between-study heterogeneity, and the analysis with moderator variables. RESULTS: This review included 42 studies done predominantly in China. The mean and median incubation period were of maximum 8 days and 12 days respectively. In various parametric models, the 95th percentiles were in the range 10.3-16 days. The highest 99th percentile would be as long as 20.4 days. Out of the 10 included studies in the meta-analysis, 8 were conducted in China, 1 in Singapore, and 1 in Argentina. The pooled mean incubation period was 6.2 (95% CI 5.4, 7.0) days. The heterogeneity (I2 77.1%; p < 0.001) was decreased when we included the study quality and the method of calculation used as moderator variables (I2 0%). The mean incubation period ranged from 5.2 (95% CI 4.4 to 5.9) to 6.65 days (95% CI 6.0 to 7.2).

The aim of this study was to estimate the diagnostic test characteristics of physician's gestalt for COVID-19 in the emergency department (ED), based on clinical findings or on a combination of clinical findings and bedside imaging results. METHODS: From April 1 to April 30, 2020, patients with suspected COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled in two EDs. Physicians prospectively dichotomized patients in COVID-19 likely or unlikely twice: after medical evaluation of clinical features (clinical gestalt [CG]) and after evaluation of clinical features and results of lung ultrasound or chest x-ray (clinical and bedside imaging-integrated gestalt [CBIIG]). The final diagnosis was adjudicated after independent review of 30-day follow-up data. RESULTS: Among 838 ED enrolled patients, 193 (23%) were finally diagnosed with COVID-19. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of CG and CBIIG for COVID-19 were 80.8% and 91.6% (p < 0.01), 82.9% and 91.4% (p = 0.01), and 78.6% and 91.8% (p < 0.01), respectively. CBIIG had similar AUC and sensitivity to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 on the first nasopharyngeal swab per se (93.5%, p = 0.24; and 87%, p = 0.17, respectively). CBIIG plus RT-PCR had a sensitivity of 98.4% for COVID-19 (p < 0.01 vs. RT-PCR alone) compared to 95.9% for CG plus RT-PCR (p = 0.05).

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 and death in a cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease or parkinsonism compared to a control population cohort, during the epidemic bout (March-May 2020) in Bologna, northern Italy. METHOD: Participants of the ParkLink study with the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease or parkinsonism, and people anonymously matched (ratio 1:10) for sex, age, district, Charlson Index were included. The hospital admission rate for COVID-19 (February 26 - May 31, 2020) and the death rate for any cause were the outcomes of interest. RESULTS: The ParkLink cohort included 696 subjects with Parkinson's disease and 184 with parkinsonism; the control cohort 8,590 subjects. The 3-month hospitalization rate for COVID-19 was 0.6% in Parkinson's disease, 3.3% in parkinsonism, 0.7% in controls. The adjusted hazard ratio (age, sex, district, Charlson Index) was 0.8 (95% CI 0.3-2.3, p=0.74) in Parkinson's disease and 3.3 (1.4-7.6, p=0.006) in parkinsonism compared to controls. Twenty-nine of the infected subjects died; 30-day fatality rate was 35.1%, without difference among the three groups. Six out of ten Parkinson's disease/parkinsonism patients had the infection during hospitalization or in nursing home. CONCLUSIONS: Parkinson's disease per-se probably is not a risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalization. Conversely, parkinsonism is an independent risk factor probably due to a more severe health status, entailing a higher care dependency and the placement in high infection risk accommodations.

In addition to the vast number of global mortalities due to COVID-19, since its outbreak, almost every aspect of human lives has changed one way or another. In the present review, various defensive and offensive strategies developed to confront COVID-19 are illustrated. The Administration of immune-boosting micronutrients/agents, as well as the inhibition of the activity of incompetent gatekeepers, including some host cell receptors (e.g. ACE2) and proteases (e.g. TMPRSS2), are some efficient defensive strategies. Antibody/phage therapies and specifically vaccines also play a prominent role in the enhancement of host defense against COVID-19. Nanotechnology, however, can considerably weaken the virulence of SARS-CoV-2, utilizing fake cellular locks (compounds mimicking cell receptors) to block the viral keys (spike proteins). Generally, two strategies are developed to interfere with the binding of spike proteins to the host cell receptors, either utilizing fake cellular locks to block the viral keys or utilizing fake viral keys to block the cellular locks. Due to their evolutionary conserved nature, viral enzymes, including 3CLpro, PLpro, RdRp, and helicase are highly potential targets for drug repurposing strategy. Thus, various steps of viral replication/transcription can effectively be blocked by their inhibition, leading to the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, RNA decoy and CRISPR technologies likely offer the best offensive strategies after viral entry into the host cells, inhibiting the viral replication/assembly in the infected cells and substantially reducing the quantity of viral progeny.","Khodajou-Masouleh, Hamidreza; Shahangian, S Shirin; Rasti, Behnam",Drug Metab Rev,579,16

These documents reflect a tension that stems from limited healthcare resources which are insufficient to save lives that, under normal conditions, could have been saved, or at least could have received the best possible treatment. First, we analyse the healthcare systems of these two countries before the spread of the virus, both of which have seen decreases in the number of intensive care beds and have been marked by financial cuts during the last ten years. It is a fact that a greater number of people, especially those over 70 years of age, have been left without respiratory support treatment, and therefore, there have been a greater number of deaths. It is also a fact that there has been a higher infection rate among healthcare professionals due to the delay in the management of protective measures and the inability to provide adequate care for those in nursing homes, as recognised by WHO. In the context of this health emergency, healthcare professionals have suffered a real ‘moral distress’ because, knowing first-hand the causes of the limitation of resources, they have had to put triage protocols into practice. Finally, we set forth a series of concrete ethical proposals with which to face the successive waves of COVID-19 infection, as well as other future pandemics.","Faggioni, Maurizio P.; Fermín Jesús, González-Melado Di Pietro Maria Luisa",Journal of Medical Ethics,579,26

In the absence of vaccines and the unavailability of effective drugs for the SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccine development is being continuously explored and several antiviral compounds and immunotherapies are currently being investigated. Given the high similarity in genetic identity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the present investigation identified the interaction between the physicochemical properties and the antiviral activity of different potential and clinically approved antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV using hierarchically weighted principal component analysis. Representative drugs from the classes of neuraminidase inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, nucleoside analogues, and other compounds with potential antiviral activity were examined. The pharmacologic classification and the biological activity of the different antiviral drugs were described using indices, namely, rotatable bond count, molecular weight, heavy atom count, and molecular complexity (92.32% contribution rate). The physicochemical properties and inhibitory action against SARS-CoV-2 of lopinavir, chloroquine, ivermectin, and ciclesonide validated the adequacy of the current computational approach. The findings of the present study provide additional information, although further investigation is warranted to identify potential targets and establish exact mechanisms, in the emergent search and design of antiviral drug candidates and their subsequent synthesis as effective therapies for COVID-19.","Sumalapao, Derick Erl P.",J.

Single-center observational study of children with PIMS-TS from 10th April to 9th May 2020. Data on ECG and echocardiogram were retrospectively analyzed along with demographics, clinical features and blood parameters. Fifteen children with median age of 8.8 (IQR 6.4-11.2) years were included, all were from African/Afro-Caribbean, South Asian, Mixed or other minority ethnic groups. All showed raised inflammatory/cardiac markers (CRP, ferritin, Troponin I, CK and pro-BNP). Transient valve regurgitation was present in 10 patients (67%). Left Ventricular ejection fraction was reduced in 12 (80%), fractional shortening in 8 (53%) with resolution in all but 2. Fourteen (93%) had coronary artery abnormalities, with normalization in 6. ECG abnormalities were present in 9 (60%) which normalized in 6 by discharge. Ten (67%) needed inotropes and/or vasopressors. None needed extracorporeal life support. Improvement in cardiac biochemical markers was closely followed by improvement in ECG/echocardiogram. All patients were discharged alive and twelve (80%) have been reviewed since. Our entire cohort with PIMS-TS had cardiac involvement and this degree of involvement is significantly more than other published series and emphasizes the need for specialist cardiac review.

In both trials, iota-carrageenan was administered nasally three times per day for 7 days for patients with the common cold and follow-up lasted for 21 days. We used Cox regression to estimate the effect of carrageenan on recovery rate. We also used quantile regression to calculate the effect of carrageenan on colds of differing lengths. Nasal carrageenan increased the recovery rate from all colds by 54% (95% CI 15%-105%; p = .003). The increase in recovery rate was 139% for coronavirus infections, 119% for influenza A infections, and 70% for rhinovirus infections. The mean duration of all colds in the placebo groups of the first four quintiles were 4.0, 6.8, 8.8, and 13.7 days, respectively. The fifth quintile contained patients with censored data. The 13.7-day colds were shortened by 3.8 days (28% reduction), and 8.8-day colds by 1.3 days (15% reduction). Carrageenan had no meaningful effect on shorter colds. In the placebo group, 21 patients had colds lasting over 20 days, compared with six patients in the carrageenan group, which corresponds to a 71% (p = .003) reduction in the risk of longer colds. Given that carrageenan has an effect on diverse virus groups, and effects at the clinical level on two old coronaviruses, it seems plausible that carrageenan may have an effect on COVID-19. Further research on nasal iota-carrageenan is warranted.","Hemilä, Harri; Chalker, Elizabeth",Pharmacol Res Perspect,579,16

Their use, however, is deeply connected to social and cultural practices and has acquired a variety of personal and social meanings. This article aims to identify the diversity of sociocultural, ethical, and political meanings attributed to face masks, how they might impact public health policies, and how they should be considered in health communication. In May 2020, we involved 29 experts of an interdisciplinary research network on health and society to provide their testimonies on the use of face masks in 20 European and 2 Asian countries (China and South Korea). They reflected on regulations in the corresponding jurisdictions as well as the personal and social aspects of face mask wearing. We analyzed those testimonies thematically, employing the method of qualitative descriptive analysis. The analysis framed the four dimensions of the societal and personal practices of wearing (or not wearing) face masks: individual perceptions of infection risk, personal interpretations of responsibility and solidarity, cultural traditions and religious imprinting, and the need of expressing self-identity. Our study points to the importance for an in-depth understanding of the cultural and sociopolitical considerations around the personal and social meaning of mask wearing in different contexts as a necessary prerequisite for the assessment of the effectiveness of face masks as a public health measure. Improving the personal and collective understanding of citizens' behaviors and attitudes appears essential for designing more effective health communications about COVID-19 pandemic or other global crises in the future. To wear a face mask or not to wear a face mask? Nowadays, this question has been analogous to the famous line from Shakespeare's Hamlet: ""To be or not to be, that is the question.""

Saliva is an attractive option as an alternative for nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), since saliva can be self-collected, is non-invasive, and sample quality is not dependent on the expertise of the collector. OBJECTIVE: To compare SARS CoV-2 positivity on paired NPS and saliva samples. STUDY DESIGN: NPS and paired saliva samples were prospectively collected from symptomatic outpatients suspected of having COVID-19 and were tested by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: In total, 35/124 (26.6 %) samples were RT-PCR positive, with 33/35 positive by NPS (sensitivityâ¯=â¯94.3 % (95 % CI 81.4%-99.0%)) and 30/35 by pure saliva (sensitivityâ¯=â¯85.7 % (95 % CI 70.6%-93.7%)), for an overall agreement of 117/124 (94.4 %). The median cycle threshold value was significantly lower for NPS than for saliva (pâ¯=â¯0.0331). A third or more of pure saliva samples from symptomatic patients were thick, stringy, and difficult to pipet.

This study examined their knowledge, preparedness, and experiences managing COVID-19 in the Australian healthcare settings. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of ICPs and ID physician members of the Australasian College for Infection Prevention and Control (ACIPC) and the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases (ASID) was conducted using an online survey. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise and report data. RESULTS: A total of 103 survey responses were included in the analysis for ICPs and 45 for ID physicians. A majority of ICPs (78.7%) and ID physicians (77.8%) indicated having 'very good' or 'good' level of knowledge of COVID-19. Almost all ICPs (94.2%) relied on state or territory's department of health websites to source up-to-date information While most ID physicians (84.4%) used scientific literature and journals. A majority of ICPs (96%) and ID physicians (73.3%) reported feeling 'moderately prepared' or 'extremely prepared' for managing COVID-19. Most respondents had received specific training about COVID-19 within their workplace (ICPs: 75%; ID physicians: 66.7%), particularly training/certification in PPE use, which made them feel 'mostly or entirely confident' in using it. Most ICPs (84.5%) and ID physicians (76.2%) reported having 'considerably' or 'moderately more' work added to their daily duties.

Such systems hold the potential to significantly help users with motor and cognitive disabilities who currently depend on their caregiver even for basic needs (eg, opening a door). The research on voice assistants is mainly dedicated to able-bodied users, and studies evaluating the accessibility of such systems are still sparse and fail to account for the participants' actual motor, linguistic, and cognitive abilities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to investigate whether cognitive and/or linguistic functions could predict user performance in operating an off-the-shelf voice assistant (Google Home). METHODS: A group of users with disabilities (n=16) was invited to a living laboratory and asked to interact with the system. Besides collecting data on their performance and experience with the system, their cognitive and linguistic skills were assessed using standardized inventories. The identification of predictors (cognitive and/or linguistic) capable of accounting for an efficient interaction with the voice assistant was investigated by performing multiple linear regression models. The best model was identified by adopting a selection strategy based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). RESULTS: For users with disabilities, the effectiveness of interacting with a voice assistant is predicted by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Robertson Dysarthria Profile (specifically, the ability to repeat sentences), as the best model shows (AIC=130.11). CONCLUSIONS: Users with motor, linguistic, and cognitive impairments can effectively interact with voice assistants, given specific levels of residual cognitive and linguistic skills. More specifically, our paper advances practical indicators to predict the level of accessibility of speech-based interactive systems. Finally, accessibility design guidelines are introduced based on the performance results observed in users with disabilities.","Masina, Fabio; Orso, Valeria; Pluchino, Patrik; Dainese, Giulia; Volpato, Stefania; Nelini, Cristian; Mapelli, Daniela; Spagnolli, Anna; Gamberini, Luciano",J Med Internet Res,579,4

Students who lack this skill may over-estimate their knowledge and under-prepare for exams, resulting in poor academic performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the ability of allied health students to evaluate their exam performance in an anatomy course to identify which groups, if any, need support with this skill. Methods In an IRB-approved study, first-year physician assistant (PA), physical therapy (PT), and occupational therapy (OT) students (n=129) participated in a doctoral-level anatomy course. This course covered human anatomy through asynchronous lectures and synchronous virtual labs (due to COVID). Students? anatomical knowledge was assessed via four exams throughout the course. Prior to the start of the course and again at the end, students were invited to complete a de-identified pre-survey including the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI), a 52-item survey that assesses metacognition. Throughout the course, students were asked to reflect on their exam performances (anticipated grade, actual grade, and satisfaction) using a modified Likert scale. For analyses, students were divided into terciles based on their mean combined exam performance. Reflections and MAI scores were then compared across terciles in SPSS using Kruskal-Wallis H test. Results Average exam scores of high (93%±2.0), middle (86%±2.7), and low-performers (74%±4.6) were significantly different from each other (p&lt;0.01). A total of 113 (88%) and 59 (46%) students completed the pre- and post-surveys, respectively, resulting in 52 matched pairs (40%). Overall, students significantly improved their metacognition (p&lt;0.01). Reflection participation ranged from 67% to 97%. When asked how their actual grade measured against their anticipated grade, high- and middle-performers? anticipated grades were similar to each other but significantly higher than those of low-performers (p&lt;0.01 for three exams). High-performers reported significantly greater exam satisfaction than middle- and low-performers on two exams (p&lt;0.01). The performance terciles scored similarly across all metacognition subcategories in the post-survey except declarative knowledge, the factual knowledge of structures and concepts that provides the foundation for higher-order thinking (p=0.01). Conclusion In this study, middle-performers appear to have the greatest mismatch between their anticipated grade, actual grade, and exam satisfaction when compared to high- and low-performers. These students anticipate strong exam performances, but appear to fall short, leaving them less satisfied. This metacognitive disconnect may be related to how students evaluate their knowledge. Students seem to evaluate their progress based on their declarative knowledge, which may not accurately represent their ability to apply that knowledge. Significance Metacognitive activities that improve student self-evaluation skills should be implemented in anatomy courses to minimize the metacognitive disconnect between anticipated and actual exam performance.","Cale, Andrew McNulty Margaret",The FASEB Journal,579,16

Of particular and growing concern are shortages of allied health professionals (AHPs). This study explored the contextual factors impacting the recruitment and retention of AHPs in rural Australia. A qualitative approach using a constructivist-interpretivist methodology was taken. Semi-structured interviews (n = 74) with executive staff, allied health (AH) managers and newly recruited AHPs working in two rural public health services in Victoria, Australia were conducted. Data was coded and categorised inductively and analysed thematically. The findings suggest that to support a stable and sustainable AH workforce, rural public sector health services need to be more efficient, strategic and visionary. This means ensuring that policies and procedures are equitable and accessible, processes are effective, and action is taken to develop local programs, opportunities and supports that allow AH staff to thrive and grow in place at all grade levels and life stages. This study reinforces the need for a whole-of-community approach to effectively support individual AH workers and their family members in adjusting to a new place and developing a sense of belonging in place.

Results of meta-analysis indicated that acute cardiac injury, (OR: 13.29, 95% CI 7.35-24.03), hypertension (OR: 2.60, 95% CI 2.11-3.19), heart Failure (OR: 6.72, 95% CI 3.34-13.52), arrhythmia (OR: 2.75, 95% CI 1.43-5.25), coronary artery disease (OR: 3.78, 95% CI 2.42-5.90), and cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.61, 95% CI 1.89-3.62) were significantly associated with mortality. Arrhythmia (OR: 7.03, 95% CI 2.79-17.69), acute cardiac injury (OR: 15.58, 95% CI 5.15-47.12), coronary heart disease (OR: 2.61, 95% CI 1.09-6.26), cardiovascular disease (OR: 3.11, 95% CI 1.59-6.09), and hypertension (OR: 1.95, 95% CI 1.41-2.68) were also significantly associated with ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Findings of this study revealed a high burden of CVDs among COVID-19 patients, which was significantly associated with mortality and ICU admission. Proper management of CVD patients with COVID-19 and monitoring COVID-19 patients for acute cardiac conditions is highly recommended to prevent mortality and critical situations.","Hessami, Amirhossein; Shamshirian, Amir; Heydari, Keyvan; Pourali, Fatemeh; Alizadeh-Navaei, Reza; Moosazadeh, Mahmood; Abrotan, Saeed; Shojaie, Layla; Sedighi, Sogol; Shamshirian, Danial; Rezaei, Nima",Am. j. emerg. med,579,1

(Special issue on COVID-19.),16.888878,4.853498,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The potential impact of coronary atherosclerosis, as detected by coronary artery calcium, on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients remains unsettled. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of clinical and subclinical coronary artery disease (CAD), as assessed by coronary artery calcium score (CAC), in a large, unselected population of hospitalized COVID-19 patients undergoing non-gated chest computed tomography (CT) for clinical practice. METHODS: SARS-CoV 2 positive patients from the multicenter (16 Italian hospitals), retrospective observational SCORE COVID-19 (calcium score for COVID-19 Risk Evaluation) registry were stratified in three groups: (a) ""clinical CAD"" (prior revascularization history), (b) ""subclinical CAD"" (CAC >0), (c) ""No CAD"" (CAC = 0). Primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality and the secondary endpoint was a composite of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident (MI/CVA). RESULTS: Amongst 1625 patients (male 67.2%, median age 69 [interquartile range 58-77] years), 31%, 57.8% and 11.1% had no, subclinical and clinical CAD, respectively. Increasing rates of in-hospital mortality (11.3% vs. 27.3% vs. 39.8%, p < 0.001) and MI/CVA events (2.3% vs. 3.8% vs. 11.9%, p < 0.001) were observed for patients with no CAD vs. subclinical CAD vs clinical CAD, respectively. The association with in-hospital mortality was independent of in-study outcome predictors (age, peripheral artery disease, active cancer, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, LDH, aerated lung volume): subclinical CAD vs. No CAD: adjusted hazard ratio (adj-HR) 2.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-7.17, p=0.025); clinical CAD vs. No CAD: adj-HR 3.74 (95% CI 1.21-11.60, p=0.022). Among patients with subclinical CAD, increasing CAC burden was associated with higher rates of in-hospital mortality (20.5% vs. 27.9% vs. 38.7% for patients with CAC score thresholds&#8804;100, 101-400 and > 400, respectively, p < 0.001). The adj-HR per 50 points increase in CAC score 1.007 (95%CI 1.001-1.013, p=0.016). Cardiovascular risk factors were not independent predictors of in-hospital mortality when CAD presence and extent were taken into account. CONCLUSIONS: The presence and extent of CAD are associated with in-hospital mortality and MI/CVA among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 disease and they appear to be a better prognostic gauge as compared to a clinical cardiovascular risk assessment.","Scoccia, Alessandra; Gallone, Guglielmo; Cereda, Alberto; Palmisano, Anna; Vignale, Davide; Leone, Riccardo; Nicoletti, Valeria; Gnasso, Chiara; Monello, Alberto; Khokhar, Arif; Sticchi, Alessandro; Biagi, Andrea; Tacchetti, Carlo; Campo, Gianluca; Rapezzi, Claudio; Ponticelli, Francesco; Danzi, Gian Battista; Loffi, Marco; Pontone, Gianluca; Andreini, Daniele; Casella, Gianni; Iannopollo, Gianmarco; Ippolito, Davide; Bellani, Giacomo; Patelli, Gianluigi; Besana, Francesca; Costa, Claudia; Vignali, Luigi; Benatti, Giorgio; Iannaccone, Mario; Vaudano, Paolo Giacomo; Pacielli, Alberto; De Carlini, Caterina Chiara; Maggiolini, Stefano; Bonaffini, Pietro Andrea; Senni, Michele; Scarnecchia, Elisa; Anastasio, Fabio; Colombo, Antonio; Ferrari, Roberto; Esposito, Antonio; Giannini, Francesco; Toselli, Marco",Atherosclerosis,579,23

While the shortages are becoming acute due to supply chain disruptions, the demand for testing has increased both as a prerequisite to lifting restrictions and in preparation for the second wave. One of the potential solutions to this crisis is the development of 3D printed nasopharyngeal swabs that behave like traditional swabs. However, the opportunity to digitally conceive and fabricate swabs allows for design improvements that can potentially reduce patient pain and discomfort. The study reports the progress that has been made on the development of auxetic nasopharyngeal swabs that can shrink under axial resistance. This allows the swab to navigate through the nasal cavity with significantly less stress on the surrounding tissues. This is achieved through systematically conceived negative Poisson's ratio (-&#965;) structures in a biocompatible material. Finite element (FE) and surrogate modelling techniques were employed to identify the most optimal swab shape that allows for the highest negative strain (-Îµlat) under safe stress (&#963;von). The influence and interaction effects of the geometrical parameters on the swab's performance were also characterised. The research demonstrates a new viewpoint for the development of functional nasopharyngeal swabs that can be 3D printed to reduce patient discomfort. The methodology can be further exploited to address various challenges in biomedical devices and redistributed manufacturing.","Arjunan, Arun; Zahid, Suhaib; Baroutaji, Ahmad; Robinson, John",J Mech Behav Biomed Mater,579,1

Portal pressure can also provide accurate prognostication for patients with cirrhosis. However, there are no practical means for assessment of portal pressure. Although it is well-established that gastric mucosal blood supply increases in patients with cirrhosis, this has been difficult to reproducibly quantify. Our group developed a novel spectroscopic technology called spatially resolved subdiffuse reflectance spectroscopy (SRSRS) that enables quantification of mucosal microcirculation. We aim to ascertain if quantification of the gastric mucosal microcirculation with SRSRS correlates with clinical evidence of portal hypertension. METHODS: Patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy for clinical indications had 10 measurements taken in the endoscopically normal gastric fundus via SRSRS probe to assess microcirculation. Cases were defined as patients with cirrhosis (n=18) and controls were those without evidence liver disease (n=18); this was corroborated with transient elastography. RESULTS: Blood volume fraction (p = 0.06) and subdiffuse reflectance (p = 0.02) from shallow depth in gastric fundus were higher in patients with cirrhosis than those without. These markers were combined to yield an overall optical marker that can differentiate patients with cirrhosis from controls with a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 94% (area under receiver operating curve =0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Spectroscopic quantification of gastric fundal mucosal microcirculation is a promising surrogate of clinical correlates of portal hypertension. This approach may represent a less-intrusive surrogate biomarker for liver disease prognostication and potentially response to therapy.","Mohanty, Arpan; Eshein, Adam; Kamineni, Phanisyam; Avissar, Uri; Bliss, Charles M; Long, Michelle T; Lowe, Robert C; Moore, T Carlton; Nunes, David P; Backman, Vadim; Roy, Hemant K",Gastrointest. endosc,579,16

PADs are implicated in a range of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, in the regulation of extracellular vesicle (EV) release, and their roles in infection and immunomodulation are known to some extent, including in viral infections. In the current study we describe putative roles for PADs in COVID-19, based on in silico analysis of BioProject transcriptome data (PRJNA615032 BioProject), including lung biopsies from healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, as well as SARS-CoV-2-infected, and mock human bronchial epithelial NHBE and adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial A549 cell lines. In addition, BioProject Data PRJNA631753, analysing patients tissue biopsy data (n = 5), was utilised. We report a high individual variation observed for all PADI isozymes in the patients' tissue biopsies, including lung, in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while PADI2 and PADI4 mRNA showed most variability in lung tissue specifically. The other tissues assessed were heart, kidney, marrow, bowel, jejunum, skin and fat, which all varied with respect to mRNA levels for the different PADI isozymes. In vitro lung epithelial and adenocarcinoma alveolar cell models revealed that PADI1, PADI2 and PADI4 mRNA levels were elevated, but PADI3 and PADI6 mRNA levels were reduced in SARS-CoV-2-infected NHBE cells. In A549 cells, PADI2 mRNA was elevated, PADI3 and PADI6 mRNA was downregulated, and no effect was observed on the PADI4 or PADI6 mRNA levels in infected cells, compared with control mock cells. Our findings indicate a link between PADI expression changes, including modulation of PADI2 and PADI4, particularly in lung tissue, in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. PADI isozyme 1-6 expression in other organ biopsies also reveals putative links to COVID-19 symptoms, including vascular, cardiac and cutaneous responses, kidney injury and stroke. KEGG and GO pathway analysis furthermore identified links between PADs and inflammatory pathways, in particular between PAD4 and viral infections, as well as identifying links for PADs with a range of comorbidities. The analysis presented here highlights roles for PADs in-host responses to SARS-CoV-2, and their potential as therapeutic targets in COVID-19.","Arisan, Elif Damla; Uysal-Onganer, Pinar; Lange, Sigrun",,579,20

While scientists have moved quickly to study the physical health implications of the disease, less attention has been paid to the negative mental health repercussions. The current study utilized a community sample of adolescents who had recently completed a 2-year, four wave study of adolescent mental health (Wave 1 n = 184, Mage = 13.9 years; 50.3% female). Participants were recontacted to assess their anxiety, depression, and emotion dysregulation symptoms during the pandemic. Latent growth modeling based on four pre-COVID time points indicated the extent to which the fifth (COVID) time point deviated from trend expectations. Results showed that (a) anxiety and depression scores were significantly higher than previous trajectories would have predicted, and (b) deviations from personal trajectories were associated with higher levels of perceived lifestyle impact due to the pandemic. Furthermore, gender-based analyses revealed that financial impacts, lifestyle impacts, and coronavirus fear were differentially associated with symptom increases for male and female participants. The current study is among the first to report that adolescent mental health trajectories have been altered in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. As physical distancing and other safety precautions may be required for several years, it is essential that we gain a deep understanding of how prevention efforts are associated with significant disruptions to youth mental health to bolster youth resilience during these unprecedented times.

Individuals, health agencies, and governments are using Twitter to communicate about COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to examine key themes and topics of English-language COVID-19-related tweets posted by individuals and to explore the trends and variations in how the COVID-19-related tweets, key topics, and associated sentiments changed over a period of time from before to after the disease was declared a pandemic. METHODS: Building on the emergent stream of studies examining COVID-19-related tweets in English, we performed a temporal assessment covering the time period from January 1 to May 9, 2020, and examined variations in tweet topics and sentiment scores to uncover key trends. Combining data from two publicly available COVID-19 tweet data sets with those obtained in our own search, we compiled a data set of 13.9 million English-language COVID-19-related tweets posted by individuals. We use guided latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to infer themes and topics underlying the tweets, and we used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis to compute sentiment scores and examine weekly trends for 17 weeks. RESULTS: Topic modeling yielded 26 topics, which were grouped into 10 broader themes underlying the COVID-19-related tweets. Of the 13,937,906 examined tweets, 2,858,316 (20.51%) were about the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and markets, followed by spread and growth in cases (2,154,065, 15.45%), treatment and recovery (1,831,339, 13.14%), impact on the health care sector (1,588,499, 11.40%), and governments response (1,559,591, 11.19%). Average compound sentiment scores were found to be negative throughout the examined time period for the topics of spread and growth of cases, symptoms, racism, source of the outbreak, and political impact of COVID-19. In contrast, we saw a reversal of sentiments from negative to positive for prevention, impact on the economy and markets, government response, impact on the health care industry, and treatment and recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of dominant themes, topics, sentiments, and changing trends in tweets about the COVID-19 pandemic can help governments, health care agencies, and policy makers frame appropriate responses to prevent and control the spread of the pandemic.","Chandrasekaran, Ranganathan; Mehta, Vikalp; Valkunde, Tejali; Moustakas, Evangelos",J Med Internet Res,579,25

CONCLUSION: Although the moderate sensitivity does not allow the meaningful use of chest radiographs as part of primary screening, the specific pattern of findings in a relevant proportion of those affected should be communicated quickly as additional information and trigger appropriate protective measures. KEY POINTS: · COVID-19 infections show specific X-ray image patterns in 1/3 of patients.. · Bilateral, peripheral opacities and/or consolidations are typical imaging patterns.. · Unilateral, peripheral opacities and/or consolidations should also raise suspicion of COVID-19 infection..

Through the redistribution of scarce resources to these high-priority cases, the cardiac sector has fallen behind. In efforts to reduce transmission, reduction in direct patient-physician contact has led to a backlog of cardiac cases. However, this accumulation of postponed or cancelled nonurgent cardiac care seems to be resolvable with the assistance of technology. From telemedicine to artificial intelligence (AI), technology has transformed healthcare systems nationwide. Telemedicine enables patient monitoring from a distance, while AI unveils a whole new realm of possibilities in clinical practice, examples include: traditional systems replacement with more efficient and accurate processing machines; automation of clerical process; and triage assistance through risk predictions. These possibilities are driven by deep and machine learning. The two subsets of AI are explored and limitations regarding ""big data"" are discussed. The aims of this review are to explore AI: the advancements in methodology; current integration in cardiac surgery or other clinical scenarios; and potential future roles, which are innately nearing as the COVID-19 era urges alternative approaches for care.","Khalsa, Raveena K; Khashkhusha, Arwa; Zaidi, Sara; Harky, Amer; Bashir, Mohamad",J Card Surg,579,5

Covid-19 creates an opportunity to shift foreign policy away from the military,16.731094,5.0272336,2020,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the risk stratification of patients with myocarditis undergoing ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to describe VT ablation results and identify factors associated with arrhythmia recurrences in a cohort of patients with myocarditis. METHODS: The authors enrolled 125 consecutive patients with myocarditis, undergoing VT ablation. Before ablation, disease stage was evaluated, to identify active (AM) versus previous myocarditis (PM). The primary study endpoint was assessment of VT recurrences by 12-month follow-up. Predictors of VT recurrences were retrospectively identified. RESULTS: All patients (age 51 ± 14 years, 91% men, left ventricular ejection fraction 52% ± 9%) had history of myocarditis diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy (59%) and/or cardiac magnetic resonance (90%). Furthermore, all had multiple episodes of drug-refractory VTs. Multimodal pre-procedural staging identified 47 patients with AM (38%) and 78 patients with PM (62%). All patients showed low-voltage areas (LVA) at electroanatomical map (97% epicardial or endoepicardial); of them, 25 (20%) had wide borderzone (WBZ, constituting >50% of the whole LVA). VT recurrences were documented in 25 patients (20%) by 12 months, and in 43 (34%) by last follow-up (median 63 months; interquartile range: 39 to 87). At multivariable analysis, AM stage was the only predictor of VT recurrences by 12 months (hazard ratio: 9.5; 95% confidence interval: 2.6 to 35.3; p < 0.001), whereas both AM stage and WBZ were associated with arrhythmia recurrences anytime during follow-up. No VT episodes were found after redo ablation was performed in 23 patients during PM stage. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that VT ablation should be avoided during AM, but is often of benefit for recurrent VT after the acute phase of myocarditis.","Peretto, Giovanni; Sala, Simone; Basso, Cristina; Rizzo, Stefania; Radinovic, Andrea; Frontera, Antonio; Limite, Luca Rosario; Paglino, Gabriele; Bisceglia, Caterina; De Luca, Giacomo; Campochiaro, Corrado; Sartorelli, Silvia; Palmisano, Anna; Esposito, Antonio; Busnardo, Elena; Villatore, Andrea; Baratto, Francesca; Cireddu, Manuela; Marzi, Alessandra; D039,; Angelo, Giuseppe; Gulletta, Simone; Vergara, Pasquale; De Cobelli, Francesco; Dagna, Lorenzo; Mazzone, Patrizio; Della Bella, Paolo",J Am Coll Cardiol,579,1

Primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells are among the first targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we show that ColdZyme medical device mouth spray efficiently protected against virus entry, excessive inflammation, and tissue damage. Applying ColdZyme to fully differentiated, polarized human epithelium cultured at an air-liquid interphase (ALI) completely blocked binding of SARS-CoV-2 and increased local complement activation mediated by the virus as well as productive infection of the tissue model. While SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in exaggerated intracellular complement activation immediately following infection and a drop in transepithelial resistance, these parameters were bypassed by single pretreatment of the tissues with ColdZyme mouth spray. Crucially, our study highlights the importance of testing already evaluated and safe drugs such as ColdZyme mouth spray for maintaining epithelial integrity and hindering SARS-CoV-2 entry within standardized three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models mimicking the in vivo human airway epithelium.IMPORTANCE Although our understanding of COVID-19 continuously progresses, essential questions regarding prophylaxis and treatment remain open. A hallmark of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is a hitherto-undescribed mechanism leading to excessive inflammation and tissue destruction associated with enhanced pathogenicity and mortality. To tackle the problem at the source, transfer of SARS-CoV-2, subsequent binding, infection, and inflammatory responses have to be avoided. In this study, we used fully differentiated, mucus-producing, and ciliated human airway epithelial cultures to test the efficacy of ColdZyme medical device mouth spray in terms of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, we found that pretreatment of the in vitro airway cultures using ColdZyme mouth spray resulted in significantly shielding the epithelial integrity, hindering virus binding and infection, and blocking excessive intrinsic complement activation within the airway cultures. Our in vitro data suggest that ColdZyme mouth spray may have an impact in prevention of COVID-19.","Posch, W; Vosper, J; Zaderer, V; Noureen, A; Constant, S; Bellmann-Weiler, R; Lass-Flörl, C; Wilflingseder, D",mBio (Online),579,24

However, little is known as to how each of these two events have impacted the other. A rapid qualitative assessment was conducted to determine the impact of the pandemic on preparedness and response to natural disasters and the impact of past experiences with natural disasters in responding to the pandemic. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 representatives of 24 different community-based programs in southern Louisiana. Data were analyzed using procedures embedded in the Rapid Assessment Procedure-Informed Community Ethnography methodology, using techniques of immersion and crystallization and focused thematic analysis. Results: The pandemic has impacted the form and function of disaster preparedness, making it harder to plan for evacuations in the event of a hurricane. Specific concerns included being able to see people in person, providing food and other resources to residents who shelter in place, finding volunteers to assist in food distribution and other forms of disaster response, competing for funds to support disaster-related activities, developing new support infrastructures, and focusing on equity in disaster preparedness. However, several strengths based on disaster preparedness experience and capabilities were identified, including providing a framework for how to respond and adapt to COVID and integration of COVID response with their normal disaster preparedness activities. Conclusions: Although prior experience has enabled community-based organizations to respond to the pandemic, the pandemic is also creating new challenges to preparing for and responding to natural disasters.","Palinkas, Lawrence A; Springgate, Benjamin F; Sugarman, Olivia K; Hancock, Jill; Wennerstrom, Ashley; Haywood, Catherine; Meyers, Diana; Johnson, Arthur; Polk, Mara; Pesson, Carter L; Seay, Jessica E; Stallard, Caroline N; Wells, Kenneth B",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),579,1

Due to close patient contact, medical assistants are at increased risk of an infection. Several studies have investigated psychological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on medical staff, yet studies in the outpatient setting are scarce and studies addressing medical assistants are lacking. This study aimed to investigate pandemic-related stressors, attitudes, and work outcomes among medical assistants and to identify possible determinants. METHODS: The population under study were medical assistants across entire Germany. A self-devised online questionnaire was published between April 7th, 2020, and April 14th. including questions on pandemic-related stressors, attitudes and work outcomes. Additionally, symptoms of depression and anxiety disorder were measured by PHQ-2 and GAD-2, respectively. Logistic regression was performed to identify possible determinants. RESULTS: 2150 medical assistants provided complete data (98.0% female, mean age 37.6 years). Major stressors were uncertainty about the temporal scope of the pandemic (95.1% agreement), about how to act correctly (77.5%), feelings of not being allowed to let patients down (75.9%), uncertainty about one's financial situation (67.4%) and about contact persons for further information (67.1%). One third (29.9%) of the study population screened positively for depression and 42.6% for anxiety disorder. Feeling burdened by one's financial situation was significantly associated with working in specialist practices (1.32 [1.08-1.62]), caring for children (1.51 [1.22-1.87]), depression (1.28 [1.01-1.62]), and anxiety disorder (1.93 [1.55-2.39]). Feeling burdened by thoughts about virus contraction at work was also significantly associated with working in specialist practices (1.33 [1.07-1.64]), caring for children (1.33 [1.07-1.66]), depression (1.54 [1.18-2.00]), and anxiety (4.71 [3.71-5.98]). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel evidence regarding major SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related stressors among medical assistants and suggests need for special support for medical assistants caring for children and working in specialist practices.","Dreher, Annegret; Pietrowsky, Reinhard; Loerbroks, Adrian",PLoS One,579,15

METHODS: An online sub-study was conducted (5/21/2020-6/9/2020) among Black men who have sex with women, >18 years old, and who had previously enrolled in the parent study Check It (5/17/2017-3/16/2020) to assess changes in sexual behavior during the stay-at-home orders. RESULTS: Among 111 participants, from enrollment in Check It to during stay-at-home orders, recent vaginal sex declined from 96.4% to 47.8% (p<0.0001), reports of multiple female sex partners declined from 45.0% to 14.4% (p<0.0001), and sexual abstinence increased from 3.6% to 38.7% (p<0.0001). Among those who did have vaginal sex, condomless sex rates did not change between enrollment in Check it and the sub-study (64.5% vs. 67.9%, p=0.68). During stay-at-home orders oral sex, virtual sex, and pornography viewing were 40.5%, 42.3%, and 76.6%, respectively. Some (17.1%) acquired a new sex partner during stay-at-home orders and 44.1% left their home to meet a partner for sex. Only 27.9% had seen information about safe sex during the pandemic.

We previously demonstrated that early recovery of VÎ´2+ T cells inversely correlated to EBV reactivation after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Studies in vitro and in the mouse models showed the cytotoxic activity of VÎ´2+ T cells on EBV-transformed lymphoproliferative cells, but the efficacy was moderate. Bisphosphonate, such as pamidronate (PAM), have been reported as a sensitizer to trigger tumor cells for VÎ´2+ T cells recognition. Valproic acid (VPA) has attracted attentions due to its adjuvant anti-tumor effect with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Whether PAM and VPA facilitate the immunogenicity of EBV-infected cells towards VÎ´2+ T cells cytotoxicity remains unknown. Herein, we demonstrated that lower dosage of VPA and/or PAM did not induce apoptosis of EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBV-LCLs) or VÎ´2+ T cells. Notably, pre-treatment with PAM significantly increased the cell death of EBV-LCLs after co-culture with VÎ´2+ T cells at different ratios. Combining treatment with VPA reinforced the sensitizing effect of PAM. This efficacy was through inducing the accumulation of mevalonate pathway intermediates and dependent on the Î³Î´ T cell receptor of VÎ´2+ T cells. Similar sensitizing effects of PAM and PAM plus VPA were also demonstrated on the primary PTLD cells. These results highlight the roles of PAM and VPA in the enhancement of immune surveillance and expand the fields of these two drugs in the treatment of different types of malignancies.","Gao, Haitao; Liu, Ruoyang; Wu, Ning; Mo, Xiao-Dong; Han, Wei; Huang, Xin; Huang, Xiao-Jun; Liu, Jiangying",Int Immunopharmacol,579,16

The molecular mechanism behind such variability is still under investigation. Several pieces of experimental evidence suggest that genetic variants influencing the onset, maintenance and resolution of the immune response may be fundamental in predicting the evolution of the disease. The identification of genetic variants behind immune system reactivity and function in COVID-19 may help in the elaboration of personalized therapeutic strategies. In the frenetic look for universally shared treatment plans, those genetic variants that are common to other diseases/models may also help in addressing future research in terms of drug repurposing. In this paper, we discuss the most recent updates about the role of immunogenetics in determining the susceptibility to and the history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We propose a narrative review of available data, speculating about lessons that we have learnt from other viral infections and immunosenescence, and discussing what kind of aspects of research should be deepened in order to improve our knowledge of how host genetic variability impacts the outcome for COVID-19 patients.","Pojero, Fanny; Candore, Giuseppina; Caruso, Calogero; Di Bona, Danilo; Groneberg, David A; Ligotti, Mattia E; Accardi, Giulia; Aiello, Anna",Int. j. mol. sci.

This study was performed to gather electronic clinic utilization data and to better define barriers to visit completion. METHODS: A retrospective review of 199 patients cared for by a general surgery service with subsequent referral to the electronic clinic (January 2019 to June 2019) was performed. Data regarding demographics, medical characteristics, travel distance, and postoperative complications were collected. Patients were categorized based upon visit completion. The &#967;2 and Fisher exact analyses were performed as appropriate. Reasons for cancellations were categorized. RESULTS: More than 1/5 of all patients (21.6%) failed to complete the visit. No differences were observed in completion rates according to the type of operation, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and age. The failed-completion group had a significantly (P < .05) higher proportion of non-Caucasian patients and those with a marital status of single. Travel distance had no impact. Complication rates were low. Pre-clinic readmission within 30 days contributed to failed completion. Reasons for cancellation included medical issues, technical difficulties, and patient preference to have no follow-up in the electronic clinic. CONCLUSION: Several factors contribute to a patient's failure to complete an electronic clinic visit including marital status, medical complications, technical issues, and patient preference. Electronic clinic utilization patterns also demonstrate racial disparities. Successful electronic clinic program implementation requires understanding the factors that contribute to failed visits to address them and improve access.","Kemp, Michael T; Williams, Aaron M; Sharma, Sriganesh B; Biesterveld, Ben E; Wakam, Glenn K; Matusko, Niki; Wilson, Jesse K; Cohen, Mark S; Alam, Hasan B",Surgery (St. Louis),579,1

To expedite this process even further, human challenge trials have been proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an alternative to conventional approaches. In such trials, healthy volunteers are deliberately infected with the pathogen of interest, enabling scientists to study the infection process and facilitate further research on treatments or prophylactics, including vaccines. While human challenge trials would offer a collective benefit to society, minimizing the risks is always difficult. Ethical controversy thus inevitably surrounds these trials. Typically, healthy young adults are recruited to serve as the first candidate subjects for human challenge trials because they are generally considered to represent a low-risk population. Here, we present three reasons for doubt about this healthy-young-adults-first criterion and give justification for also recruiting healthy older adults (or not-young adults), meaning those over 30 years of age, to participate in such trials for SARS-CoV-2.","Matsui, Kenji; Inoue, Yusuke; Yamamoto, Keiichiro",Ethics Hum Res,579,4

A clearer understanding of which individuals are most at risk of over-eating during the lockdown period is needed to inform interventions that promote healthy diets and prevent weight gain during lockdowns. An online survey collected during the COVID-19 lockdown (total n = 875; analysed n = 588; 33.4 ± 12.6 years; 82% UK-based; mostly white, educated, and not home schooling) investigated reported changes to the amount consumed and changes to intake of high energy dense (HED) sweet and savoury foods. The study also assessed which eating behaviour traits predicted a reported increase of HED sweet and savoury foods and tested whether coping responses moderated this relationship. Results showed that 48% of participants reported increased food intake in response to the COVID-19 lockdown. There was large individual variability in reported changes and lower craving control was the strongest predictor of increased HED sweet and savoury food intake. Low cognitive restraint also predicted greater increases in HED sweet snacks and HED savoury meal foods. Food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, emotional undereating, emotional overeating and satiety responsiveness were not significant predictors of changes to HED sweet and savoury food intake. High scores on acceptance coping responses attenuated the conditional effects of craving control on HED sweet snack intake. Consistent with previous findings, the current research suggests that low craving control is a risk factor for increased snack food intake during lockdown and may therefore represent a target for intervention.","Buckland, Nicola J; Swinnerton, Lucy F; Ng, Kwok; Price, Menna; Wilkinson, Laura L; Myers, Anna; Dalton, Michelle",Appetite,579,33

Producing a protein structure from the discrete voxel grid data of cryo-EM maps involves interpolation into the continuous spatial domain. We present a novel data format called the neural cryo-EM map, which is formed from a set of neural networks that accurately parameterize cryo-EM maps and provide native, spatially continuous data for density and gradient. As a case study of this data format, we create graph-based interpretations of high resolution experimental cryo-EM maps. Normalized cryo-EM map values interpolated using the non-linear neural cryo-EM format are more accurate, consistently scoring less than 0.01 mean absolute error, than a conventional tri-linear interpolation, which scores up to 0.12 mean absolute error. Our graph-based interpretations of 115 experimental cryo-EM maps from 1.15 to 4.0 Angstrom resolution provide high coverage of the underlying amino acid residue locations, while accuracy of nodes is correlated with resolution. The nodes of graphs created from atomic resolution maps (higher than 1.6 Angstroms) provide greater than 99% residue coverage as well as 85% full atomic coverage with a mean of than 0.19 Angstrom root mean squared deviation (RMSD). Other graphs have a mean 84% residue coverage with less specificity of the nodes due to experimental noise and differences of density context at lower resolutions.

In order to handle graphs with different features and sizes, we propose a novel graph neural network, which we call HaarNet, to predict graph labels with interrelated convolution and pooling strategies. Similar to some existing routines, the model assembles unified graph-level representations from samples by first adopting graph convolutional layers to extract mutual information followed by graph pooling layers to downsample graph resolution. By a sequence of clusterings, we embed the intrinsic topological information of each graph into the GNN. Through the fast Haar transformation, we made our contribution to forming a smooth workflow that learns multi-scale graph representation with redundancy removed. As a result, our proposed framework obtains notable accuracy gains without sacrificing performance stability. Extensive experiments validate the superiority on graph classification and regression tasks, where our proposed HaarNet outperforms various existing GNN models, especially on big data sets.","Zheng, Xuebin; Zhou, Bingxin; Li, Ming; Wang, Yu Guang; Gao, Junbin",,579,1

When COVID-19 arrived in Brazil, a crisis scenario that incorporated economic, social and political aspects became highly visible. This scenario fostered unemployment, poverty and hunger. Besides that, it exposed multiple vulnerabilities that were getting worse over the past few years prior to the pandemic. In this context, COVID-19 found in Brazil a fertile ground for its dissemination and community transmission. The impacts of the suspension of many commercial activities and other economic sectors due to the pandemic were quickly felt socially and economically in Brazil. Some of the actions carried out by the Brazilian government included the emergency aid payment and exemption from payment of energy bills for vulnerable individuals, release of funds for programmes for the direct purchase of food from family farmers, delivery of school food kits directly to students despite the closure of schools and publication of sanitary rules for the operation of restaurants. However, these actions are still insufficient, slow and not sufficiently coordinated to contain the progress of the food and nutritional insecurity crisis in Brazil. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgency for the Brazilian government to again prioritise the FNS agenda. This includes implementing mechanisms to ensure the Human Right to Adequate Food and expanding existing FNS programmes.","Carvalho, Carolina Abreu de; Viola, Poliana Cristina de Almeida Fonseca; Sperandio, Naiara",Public Health Nutr,579,16

Cardiovascular manifestations are common and studies have shown an increase in right ventricular (RV) dysfunction associated with mortality. These studies, however, comprise heterogeneous patient groups with few requiring invasive ventilation. This study will investigate the prevalence and prognostic significance of RV dysfunction in ventilated patients with COVID-19 which may lead to targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective multicentre observational cohort study will perform transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in 150 patients with COVID-19 requiring invasive ventilation for more than 48 hours. RV dysfunction will be defined as TTE evidence of RV dilatation along with the presence of septal flattening. Baseline demographics, disease severity data and clinical information relating to proposed aetiological mechanisms of RV dysfunction (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), disordered coagulation, direct myocardial injury and ventilation) will be collected and analysed.Primary outcome measures include the prevalence of RV dysfunction and its association with 30-day mortality. Exploratory outcome measures will investigate the association of the proposed aetiological mechanisms of RV dysfunction to the primary outcomes.Prevalence of RV dysfunction will be determined along with 95% Clopper-Pearson CIs and 30-day survival will be analysed using logistic regression adjusting for patient demographics, phase of disease and baseline severity of illness. The role of potential aetiological factors (ARDS, disordered coagulation, direct myocardial injury and ventilation) in relation to the primary outcomes will be analysed using logistic regression. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval was gained from Scotland A Research Ethics Committee (REC reference 20/SS/0059).

Cross-sectional data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey 2003-2017 were analyzed. Data on age, sex, hand-washing practices in the past 30 days, and severe food insecurity (i.e., proxy of socioeconomic status) were self-reported. Multivariable logistic regression and meta-analysis with random effects based on country-wise estimates were conducted to assess associations. Adolescents (n = 209,584) aged 12-15 years [mean (SD) age 13.8 (1.0) years; 50.9% boys] were included in the analysis. Overall, the prevalence of hand-washing practices were as follows: never/rarely washing hands before eating (6.4%), after using toilet (5.6%), or with soap (8.8%). The prevalence of never/rarely washing hands after using the toilet (10.8%) or with soap (14.3%) was particularly high in low-income countries. Severe food insecurity was associated with 1.34 (95%CI = 1.25-1.43), 1.61 (95%CI = 1.50-1.73), and 1.44 (95%CI = 1.35-1.53) times higher odds for never/rarely washing hands before eating, after using the toilet, and with soap, respectively. A high prevalence of inadequate hand washing practices was reported, particularly in low-income countries and those with severe food insecurity. In light of the present COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid expansion being observed in low- and middle-income locations, interventions that disseminate good hand-washing practices are urgently required.

The concept of cytokine storm syndromes (CSS) encompasses diverse conditions or circumstances that coalesce around potentially lethal hyperinflammation with hemodynamic compromise and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a prototypic form of CSS that develops in the context of rheumatic diseases, particularly systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The treatment of MAS relies heavily upon corticosteroids and cytokine inhibitors, which have proven to be lifesaving therapies in MAS, as well as in other forms of CSS. Within months of the recognition of SARS-CoV2 as a human pathogen, descriptions of COVID-19 patients with hyperinflammation emerged. Physicians immediately grappled with identifying optimal therapeutic strategies for these patients, and despite clinical distinctions such as marked coagulopathy with endothelial injury associated with COVID-19, borrowed from the experiences with MAS and other CSS. Initial reports of patients treated with anti-cytokine agents in COVID-19 were promising, but recent large, better-controlled studies of these agents have had mixed results suggesting a more complex pathophysiology. Here, we discuss how the comparison of clinical features, immunologic parameters and therapeutic response data between MAS and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 can provide new insight into the pathophysiology of CSS.","Ombrello, Michael J; Schulert, Grant S",Transl Res,579,23

Therefore, a scoping review was conducted to identify challenges faced by caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to consolidate parenting interventions and guidelines. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on Embase, PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and LitCovid. All article types published between December 2019 and November 2020 which reported on intervention guidelines and experiences of families with children with neurodevelopmental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Qualitative themes, quantitative data, and article summaries were charted, and a thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Twenty-nine articles were included in the review. Three themes were generated: (a) behavioral issues and health concerns, (b) disruptions of lifelines and daily routines, and (c) existing programs, models, and guidelines to support families. Additionally, a list of caregiver strategies such as scheduling regular online consultations, maintaining online therapy, educating a child on COVID-19, and preventive behaviors, creating a structured daily schedule and reinforcement system, and selecting child-appropriate activities was consolidated. CONCLUSION: This review revealed a lack of evidence-based studies and articles on children with other neurodevelopmental disorders apart from autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. It also places emphasis on the importance of telehealth services as major lifelines to parents during this pandemic and urges healthcare organizations to provide funding to increase telehealth services to afflicted families.","Shorey, Shefaly; Lau, Lydia Siew Tiang; Tan, Jia Xuan; Ng, Esperanza Debby; Ramkumar, Aishworiya",J. pediatr. psychol,579,24

When considered in terms of its effects and consequences, it can even be regarded as the beginning of a new world order. In this new order, individuals who are unintentionally exposed to chaos theories and possible disaster scenarios related to Covid-19, both in their daily life and in organizational life, can make an effort to continue their lives with the increase in their anxiety levels.

We synthesized evidence from these studies to inform mathematical modelling of the prevention cascade for oral and long-acting PrEP in the setting of western Kenya, one of the world's most heavily HIV-affected regions. METHODS: We incorporated steps of the PrEP prevention cascade - uptake, adherence, retention and re-engagement after discontinuation - into EMOD-HIV, an open-source transmission model calibrated to the demography and HIV epidemic patterns of western Kenya. Early PrEP implementation research from East Africa was used to parameterize prevention cascades for oral PrEP as currently implemented, delivery innovations for oral PrEP, and future long-acting PrEP. We compared infections averted by PrEP at the population level for different cascade assumptions and sub-populations on PrEP. Analyses were conducted over the 2020 to 2040 time horizon, with additional sensitivity analyses for the time horizon of analysis and the time when long-acting PrEP becomes available. RESULTS: The maximum impact of oral PrEP diminished by over 98% across all prevention cascades, with the exception of long-acting PrEP under optimistic assumptions about uptake and re-engagement after discontinuation. Long-acting PrEP had the highest population-level impact, even after accounting for possible delays in product availability, primarily because its effectiveness does not depend on drug adherence. Retention was the most significant cascade step reducing the potential impact of long-acting PrEP. These results were robust to assumptions about the sub-populations receiving PrEP, but were highly influenced by assumptions about re-initiation of PrEP after discontinuation, about which evidence was sparse. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation challenges along the prevention cascade compound to diminish the population-level impact of oral PrEP. Long-acting PrEP is expected to be less impacted by user uptake and adherence, but it is instead dependent on product availability in the short term and retention in the long term. To maximize the impact of long-acting PrEP, ensuring timely product approval and rollout is critical. Research is needed on strategies to improve retention and patterns of PrEP re-initiation.","Bershteyn, Anna; Sharma, Monisha; Akullian, Adam N; Peebles, Kathryn; Sarkar, Supriya; Braithwaite, R Scott; Mudimu, Edinah",J Int AIDS Soc,579,21

In addition, substantial research indicates that descriptive normative perceptions are a strong predictor of drinking behavior more generally. However, less is known about SNS-specific norms and how they might be associated with health-related behavior. Thus, the primary goal of this study was to determine whether descriptive normative perceptions for alcohol posting related to COVID-19 on SNSs are associated with both personal SNS posting behavior and drinking to cope with COVID-19-related stress, among a sample of 587 adults (48.4 percent women; mean age = 48.7 years) across the United States. All study procedures were approved by the local IRB. Results indicate that perceiving same-age peers to be posting on SNSs about their alcohol use to cope with pandemic-related stress/boredom is associated with both an increased likelihood of making such postings oneself and increased drinking to cope with the pandemic. Results have important implications for prevention and intervention efforts aimed to curb risky drinking during the pandemic and suggest that SNS behavior and norms should be incorporated into these strategies.","Litt, Dana M; Rodriguez, Lindsey M; Stewart, Sherry H",Cyberpsychology behav. soc. netw.

We analyzed hospital data from the MERS-CoV outbreak in King Abdulaziz Medical Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, June-August 2015 using the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) ward transmission model. The SEIR compartmental model considers several areas within the hospital where transmission occurred. We use a system of ordinary differential equations that incorporates the following units: emergency department (ED), out-patient clinic, intensive care unit, and hospital wards, where each area has its own carrying capacity and distinguishes the transmission by three individuals in the hospital: patients, health care workers (HCW), or mobile health care workers. The emergency department, as parameterized has a large influence over the epidemic size for both patients and health care workers. Trend of the basic reproduction number (R0), which reached a maximum of 1.39 at the peak of the epidemic and declined to 0.92 towards the end, shows that until added hospital controls are introduced, the outbreak would continue with sustained transmission between wards. Transmission rates where highest in the ED, and mobile HCWs were responsible for large part of the outbreak.","Oraby, Tamer; Tyshenko, Michael G; Balkhy, Hanan H; Tasnif, Yasar; Quiroz-Gaspar, Adriana; Mohamed, Zeinab; Araya, Ayesha; Elsaadany, Susie; Al-Mazroa, Eman; Alhelail, Mohammed A; Arabi, Yaseen M; Al-Zoughool, Mustafa",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),579,1

The relationship of GI and hepatic involvement with severe clinical course of COVID-19 has also not been explored. OBJECTIVES: The main objectives were to determine the frequency of GI and hepatic manifestations of COVID-19 and to explore their relationship with severe clinical course. METHODS: We searched PubMed for studies published between January 1, 2020, and March 25, 2020, with data on GI and hepatic manifestations in adult patients with COVID-19. These data were compared between patients with severe and good clinical course using the random-effects model and odds ratio (OR) as the effect size. If the heterogeneity among studies was high, sensitivity analysis was performed for each outcome. RESULTS: We included 62 studies (8301 patients) in the systematic review and 26 studies (4676 patients) in the meta-analysis. Diarrhea was the most common GI symptom (9%), followed by nausea/vomiting (5%) and abdominal pain (4%). Transaminases were abnormal in approximately 25%, bilirubin in 9%, prothrombin time (PT) in 7%, and low albumin in 60%. Up to 20% patients developed severe clinical course, and GI and hepatic factors associated with severe clinical course were as follows: diarrhea (OR 2), high aspartate aminotransferase (OR 1.4), high alanine aminotransferase (OR 1.6), high bilirubin (OR 2.4), low albumin (OR 3.4), and high PT (OR 3). CONCLUSIONS: GI and hepatic involvement should be sought in patients with COVID-19 since it portends severe clinical course. The pathogenesis of GI and hepatic involvement needs to be explored in future studies.","Kumar, Ashish; Arora, Anil; Sharma, Praveen; Anikhindi, Shrihari Anil; Bansal, Naresh; Singla, Vikas; Khare, Shivam; Srivastava, Abhishyant",Indian J Gastroenterol,579,14

This review endeavors to color the context into which methodology has to fit and underlines the importance of sampling and sample treatment. The context is that the highest risk of food contamination is through the animal and human fecal route with a majority of foodborne infections originating from sources in mass and domestic kitchens at the end of the food-chain. Containment requires easy-to-use, failsafe, single-use tests giving an overall risk score in situ. Conversely, progressive food-safety systems are relying increasingly on early assessment of batches and groups involving risk-based sampling, monitoring environment and herd/flock health status, and (historic) food-chain information. Accordingly, responsible field laboratories prefer specificity, multi-analyte, and high-throughput procedures. Under certain etiological and epidemiological circumstances, indirect antigen immunoaffinity assays outperform the diagnostic sensitivity and diagnostic specificity of e.g., nucleic acid sequence-based assays. The current bulk of testing involves therefore ante- and post-mortem probing of humoral response to several pathogens. In this review, the inclusion of immunoglobulins against additional invasive micro-organisms indicating the level of hygiene and ergo public health risks in tests is advocated. Immunomagnetic separation, immunochromatography, immunosensor, microsphere array, lab-on-a-chip/disc platforms increasingly in combination with nanotechnologies, are discussed. The heuristic development of portable and ambulant microfluidic devices is intriguing and promising. Tant pis, many new platforms seem unattainable as the industry standard. Comparability of results with those of reference methods hinders the implementation of new technologies. Whatever the scientific and technological excellence and incentives, the decision-maker determines this implementation after weighing mainly costs and business risks.","Debast, Sylvia B.",Foods,579,21

Therefore, in this study, we fabricated a three-dimensional (3D) nano-popcorn plasmonic substrate using the surface energy difference between a perfluorodecanethiol (PFDT) spacer and the Au layer. This energy difference led to Au nanoparticle self-assembly; neighboring nanoparticles then created multiple hotspots on the substrate. The localized surface plasmon effects at the hot spots dramatically enhanced the incident field. Quantitative evaluation of A/H1N1 virus was achieved using the decrease of Raman peak intensity resulting from the release of Cy3-labeled aptamer DNAs from nano-popcorn substrate surfaces via the interaction between the aptamer DNA and A/H1N1 virus. The use of a Raman imaging technique involving the fast mapping of all pixel points enabled the reproducible quantification of A/H1N1 virus on nano-popcorn substrates. Average ensemble effects obtained by averaging all randomly distributed hot spots mapped on the substrate made it possible to reliably quantify target viruses. The SERS-based imaging aptasensor platform proposed in this work overcomes the issues inherent in conventional approaches (the time-consuming and labor-intensiveness of RT-PCR and low sensitivity and quantitative analysis limits of lateral flow assay kits). Our SERS-based assay for detecting A/H1N1 virus had an estimated limit of detection of 97 PFU mL-1 (approximately three orders of magnitude more sensitive than that determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and the approximate assay time was estimated to be 20 min. Thus, this approach provides an ultrasensitive, reliable platform for detecting viral pathogens.","Chen, Hao; Park, Sung-Gyu; Choi, Namhyun; Moon, Joung-Il; Dang, Hajun; Das, Anupam; Lee, Seunghun; Kim, Do-Geun; Chen, Lingxin; Choo, Jaebum",Biosens Bioelectron,579,13

It has been a hot topic on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. These social media platforms enable users to share information with other users who can reshare this information, thus causing this information to spread. Twitter's retweet functionality allows users to share the existing content with other users without altering the original content. Analysis of social media platforms can help in detecting emergencies during pandemics that lead to taking preventive measures. One such type of analysis is predicting the number of retweets for a given COVID-19 related tweet. Recently, CIKM organized a retweet prediction challenge for COVID-19 tweets focusing on using numeric features only. However, our hypothesis is, tweet text may play a vital role in an accurate retweet prediction. In this paper, we combine numeric and text features for COVID-19 related retweet predictions. For this purpose, we propose two CNN and RNN based models and evaluate the performance of these models on a publicly available TweetsCOV19 dataset using seven different evaluation metrics. Our evaluation results show that combining tweet text with numeric features improves the performance of retweet prediction significantly.","Khan, Pervaiz Iqbal; Razzak, Imran; Dengel, Andreas; Ahmed, Sheraz",,579,1

K777, an irreversible, covalent inactivator of cysteine proteases that has recently completed phase 1 clinical trials, reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity in several host cells: Vero E6 (EC50< 74 nM), HeLa/ACE2 (4 nM), Caco-2 (EC90 = 4.3 µM), and A549/ACE2 (<80 nM). Infectivity of Calu-3 cells depended on the cell line assayed. If Calu-3/2B4 was used, EC50 was 7 nM, but in the ATCC Calu-3 cell line without ACE2 enrichment, EC50 was >10 µM. There was no toxicity to any of the host cell lines at 10-100 µM K777 concentration. Kinetic analysis confirmed that K777 was a potent inhibitor of human cathepsin L, whereas no inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 cysteine proteases (papain-like and 3CL-like protease) was observed. Treatment of Vero E6 cells with a propargyl derivative of K777 as an activity-based probe identified human cathepsin B and cathepsin L as the intracellular targets of this molecule in both infected and uninfected Vero E6 cells. However, cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was only carried out by cathepsin L. This cleavage was blocked by K777 and occurred in the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a different site from that previously observed for the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. These data support the hypothesis that the antiviral activity of K777 is mediated through inhibition of the activity of host cathepsin L and subsequent loss of cathepsin L-mediated viral spike protein processing.","Mellott, Drake M; Tseng, Chien-Te; Drelich, Aleksandra; Fajtová, Pavla; Chenna, Bala C; Kostomiris, Demetrios H; Hsu, Jason; Zhu, Jiyun; Taylor, Zane W; Kocurek, Klaudia I; Tat, Vivian; Katzfuss, Ardala; Li, Linfeng; Giardini, Miriam A; Skinner, Danielle; Hirata, Ken; Yoon, Michael C; Beck, Sungjun; Carlin, Aaron F; Clark, Alex E; Beretta, Laura; Maneval, Daniel; Hook, Vivian; Frueh, Felix; Hurst, Brett L; Wang, Hong; Raushel, Frank M; O039,; Donoghue, Anthony J; de Siqueira-Neto, Jair Lage; Meek, Thomas D; McKerrow, James H",ACS Chem Biol,579,1

COVID-19 is a large-scale infectious disease that broke out in 2019, and 212 countries have now been infected with this infectious disease. Some studies have shown that COVID-19 combined with diabetes is an independent risk factor for death or other adverse outcomes. There is currently no specific and effective drug treatment. More and more people have realized that the low-cost CQ and its derivative HCQ have antiviral and anti-inflammatory capabilities and may play a huge role in the fight against COVID-19. At the same time, HCQ can be used as an oral hypoglycemic agent and has the effect of lowering blood glucose. However, there is no evidence-based medicine to confirm the effectiveness and safety of CQ and HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with diabetes. Therefore, we will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the existing clinical evidences. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Chinese literature comes from CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, CBM databases. English literature mainly searches Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE. We will retrieve each database from December 2019 to August 2020. At the same time, we will look for clinical trial registration and gray literature. This study only included clinical randomized controlled trials.

While attenuated mortality was observed with aggressive glucose control, it was unclear whether therapeutic regimens including insulin treatment were beneficial for patients with COVID-19 and T2D. This retrospective study investigated 689 patients with COVID-19 and T2D from a cohort of 3,305 cases from Wuhan, China. Unexpectedly, we found that insulin treatment for patients with COVID-19 and T2D was associated with a significant increase in mortality (27.2% versus 3.5%; adjusted HR, 5.38 [2.75-10.54]). Further analysis showed that insulin treatment was associated with enhanced systemic inflammation and aggravated injuries of vital organs. Therefore, insulin treatment for patients with COVID-19 and T2D should be used with caution.","Yu, Bo; Li, Chenze; Sun, Yang; Wang, Dao Wen",Cell metab,579,16

METHODS: We use a susceptible-infected model to estimate the impact of delayed distribution of azithromycin treatment on the prevalence of active trachoma. RESULTS: We identify three distinct scenarios for geographic districts depending on whether the basic reproduction number and the treatment-associated reproduction number are above or below a value of 1. We find that when the basic reproduction number is <1, no significant delays in disease control will be caused. However, when the basic reproduction number is >1, significant delays can occur. In most districts, 1 y of COVID-related delay can be mitigated by a single extra round of mass drug administration. However, supercritical districts require a new paradigm of infection control because the current strategies will not eliminate disease. CONCLUSIONS: If the pandemic can motivate judicious, community-specific implementation of control strategies, global elimination of trachoma as a public health problem could be accelerated.","Blumberg, Seth; Borlase, Anna; Prada, Joaquin M; Solomon, Anthony W; Emerson, Paul; Hooper, Pamela J; Deiner, Michael S; Amoah, Benjamin; Hollingsworth, Deirdre; Porco, Travis C; Lietman, Thomas M",Trans.

COVID-19 presents manifestations that can range from asymptomatic or mild infections up to severe manifestations that lead to hospitalization and death. A growing amount of evidence indicates that the virus may cause neuroinvasion. Postmortem brain study findings have included edema, hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, atrophy, encephalitis, infarcts, swollen axons, myelin loss, gliosis, neuronal satellitosis, hypoxic-ischemic damage, arteriolosclerosis, leptomeningeal inflammation, neuronal loss, and axon degeneration. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic is causing dangerous effects on the mental health of the world population, some of which can be attributed to its social impact (social distancing, financial issues, and quarantine). There is also a concern that environmental stressors, enhanced by psychological factors, are contributing to the emergence of psychiatric outcomes during the pandemic. Although clinical studies and diagnosing SARS-CoV-2-related neurological disease can be challenging, they are necessary to help define the manifestations and burden of COVID-19 in neurological and psychiatric symptoms during and after the pandemic.

It is observed that both density and surface tension increase with increasing concentration of [TBA][Br], whereas the opposite trend is observed for [TBA][OAC] and [TBA][OH] respectively. This is due to stronger molecular interaction between [TBA][Br] and water compared to other ILs. The dynamic viscosity of all aqueous ILs increases with increasing IL concentration.

Restrictions of this kind were important in the response to epidemics of SARS (2003), H1N1 influenza (2009), and Ebola (2014). However, they do not always work as expected. The imposition of a cordon sanitaire to control the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, for example, is argued to have led to a higher-than-expected number of cases in the quarantined area. To determine when mobility restrictions reduce the size of an epidemic, we use a model of disease transmission within and between economically heterogeneous locally connected communities. One community comprises a low-risk, resource-rich, low-density population with access to effective medical resources. The other comprises a high-risk, resource-poor, high-density population without access to effective medical resources. We find that the overall size of an epidemic centered in the high-risk community is sensitive to the stringency of mobility restrictions between the two communities. Unrestricted mobility between the two risk communities increases the number of secondary cases in the low-risk community but reduces the overall epidemic size. By contrast, the imposition of a cordon sanitaire around the high-risk community reduces the number of secondary infections in the low-risk community but increases the overall epidemic size. The degree to which mobility restrictions increase or decrease the overall epidemic size depends on the level of risk in each community and the characteristics of the disease.","Espinoza, Baltazar; Castillo-Chavez, Carlos; Perrings, Charles",,579,28

It has had unprecedented effect on healthcare systems globally with severe impact on every specialist service within the hospital including urology. While it affects the respiratory system causing symptoms ranging from fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea, myalgia and fatigue, it eventually causes pneumonia and respiratory distress needing oxygenation and ventilation. Laboratory diagnosis is required to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19. Radiological changes are seen on chest XR or CT scan of patients. The surge in patients affected by the disease has led to extreme pressures on healthcare systems by the overwhelming number of critically unwell patients. This scenario has presented challenges to maintain other emergency and essential services. Reallocation of staff, wards and equipment has resulted in cancellations of many surgical procedures, requiring urologists to select only the most essential or critical procedures. The outpatient face-to-face clinics are also cancelled or changed to telephone or video consultations. In some hospitals, urologists are required to work outside of their usual scope of practice helping their respiratory and intensive care unit colleagues.

The negative impact of school closures on children and young people is increasingly apparent, however. OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the feasibility of an infection monitoring program in schools to enable targeted quarantining to replace school closures. The program is currently being implemented in two model schools in Magdeburg, Germany, within the framework of the Study of Coronavirus Outbreak Prevention in Magdeburg Schools (Studie zur Ausbruchsvermeidung von Corona an Magdeburger Schulen [STACAMA]). METHODS: Five pupils per class are pseudorandomly selected twice a week and asked to provide a gargle sample over a 16-week evaluation period. RNA is extracted from each sample individually in a laboratory and pooled according to school class for real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) analysis. Immediate individual sample testing will be carried out in the case of a positive pool test. Individual RNA extraction prior to pooling and application of rRT-PCR result in high test sensitivity. Testing will be performed in strict adherence to data protection standards. All participating pupils will receive a 16-digit study code, which they will be able to use to access their test. RESULTS: When the study commenced on December 2, 2020, 520 (52%) pupils and their families or guardians had consented to study participation. The study was suspended after four test rounds due to renewed school closures resulting from rising regional infection incidence. Testing resumed when schools reopened on March 8, 2021, at which time consent to participation was provided for 54% of pupils. We will quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the logistics and acceptability of the program. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study should inform the design of infection surveillance programs in schools based on gargle samples and a PCR-based pool testing procedure, enabling the identification of aspects that may require adaptation before large-scale implementation. Our focus on each step of the logistics and on the experiences of families should enable a robust assessment of the feasibility of such an approach.

Despite the high number of patients treated worldwide, data on respiratory mechanics are currently scarce and the optimal setting of MV remains to be defined. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of available data about respiratory mechanics, gas exchange and MV settings in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for COVID-19-associated acute respiratory failure, and to identify knowledge gaps. MAIN TEXT: PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases were searched from inception to October 30, 2020 for studies providing at least one ventilatory parameter collected within 24 h from the ICU admission. The quality of the studies was independently assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Form for Cohort Studies. A total of 26 studies were included for a total of 14,075 patients. At ICU admission, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) values ranged from 9 to 16.5 cm of water (cmH2O), suggesting that high levels of PEEP were commonly used for setting MV for these patients. Patients with COVID-19 are severely hypoxemic at ICU admission and show a median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ranging from 102 to 198 mmHg. Static respiratory system compliance (Crs) values at ICU admission were highly heterogenous, ranging between 24 and 49 ml/cmH2O. Prone positioning and neuromuscular blocking agents were widely used, ranging from 17 to 81 and 22 to 88%, respectively; both rates were higher than previously reported in patients with ""classical"" acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). CONCLUSIONS: Available data show that, in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19, respiratory mechanics and MV settings within 24 h from ICU admission are heterogeneous but similar to those reported for ""classical"" ARDS. However, to date, complete data regarding mechanical properties of respiratory system, optimal setting of MV and the role of rescue treatments for refractory hypoxemia are still lacking in the medical literature.","Grasselli, Giacomo; Cattaneo, Emanuele; Florio, Gaetano; Ippolito, Mariachiara; Zanella, Alberto; Cortegiani, Andrea; Huang, Jianbo; Pesenti, Antonio; Einav, Sharon",Crit Care,579,22

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the salient politicized discourses of blaming Chinese people for spreading the virus have fueled over 2000 reports of anti-Asian racial incidents and hate crimes in the United States. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to investigate the relationships between news consumption, trust, intergroup contact, and prejudicial attitudes toward Asians and Asian Americans residing in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compare how traditional news, social media use, and biased news exposure cultivate racial attitudes, and the moderating role of media use and trust on prejudice against Asians is examined. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was completed in May 2020. A total of 430 US adults (mean age 36.75, SD 11.49 years; n=258, 60% male) participated in an online survey through Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. Respondents answered questions related to traditional news exposure, social media use, perceived trust, and their top three news channels for staying informed about the novel coronavirus. In addition, intergroup contact and racial attitudes toward Asians were assessed. We performed hierarchical regression analyses to test the associations. Moderation effects were estimated using simple slopes testing with a 95% bootstrap confidence interval approach. RESULTS: Participants who identified as conservatives (ß=.08, P=.02), had a personal infection history (ß=.10, P=.004), and interacted with Asian people frequently in their daily lives (ß=.46, P<.001) reported more negative attitudes toward Asians after controlling for sociodemographic variables. Relying more on traditional news media (ß=.08, P=.04) and higher levels of trust in social media (ß=.13, P=.007) were positively associated with prejudice against Asians. In contrast, consuming news from left-leaning outlets (ß=-.15, P=.001) and neutral outlets (ß=-.13, P=.003) was linked to less prejudicial attitudes toward Asians. Among those who had high trust in social media, exposure had a negative relationship with prejudice. At high levels of trust in digital websites and apps, frequent use was related to less unfavorable attitudes toward Asians. CONCLUSIONS: Experiencing racial prejudice among the Asian population during a challenging pandemic can cause poor psychological outcomes and exacerbate health disparities. The results suggest that conservative ideology, personal infection history, frequency of intergroup contact, traditional news exposure, and trust in social media emerge as positive predictors of prejudice against Asians and Asian Americans, whereas people who get COVID-19 news from left-leaning and balanced outlets show less prejudice. For those who have more trust in social media and digital news, frequent use of these two sources is associated with lower levels of prejudice. Our findings highlight the need to reshape traditional news discourses and use social media and mobile news apps to develop credible messages for combating racial prejudice against Asians.","Tsai, Jiun-Yi; Phua, Joe; Pan, Shuya; Yang, Chia-Chen",J Med Internet Res,579,5

It has been suggested that the use of a protective barrier can reduce possible aerosol delivery from patients to clinicians during ETI. We sought to assess the performance of ETI by paramedics wearing personal protective equipment with and without the use of a box barrier. METHODS: A randomized, crossover simulation study was performed in a simulation laboratory. Study participants were 18 paramedics actively working in the clinical environment. Participants' performance of ETI via direct laryngoscopy (DL) with and without the use of a box barrier was assessed. The sequence of intubation was randomized to either BoxDL-first or DL-first. The primary outcome was the success rate of ETI on first-attempt. The secondary and tertiary outcomes were ETI success rates on three attempts and total intubation time, respectively. RESULTS: There were no differences between the DL group and the BoxDL group in one-attempt success rates (14/18 vs 12/18; P = 0.754), and in overall success rates (16/18 vs 14/18; P = 0.682). The mean (standard deviation) of the total intubation times for the DL group and the BoxDL group were 27.3 (19.7) seconds and 36.8 (26.2) seconds, respectively (P < 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this pilot study suggest that paramedics wearing personal protective equipment can successfully perform ETI using a barrier box, but the intubation time may be prolonged. The applicability of these findings to the care of COVID-19 patients remain to be investigated.","Feldman, Oren; Samuel, Nir; Kvatinsky, Noa; Idelman, Ravit; Diamand, Raz; Shavit, Itai",PLoS One,579,29

We present the second case of biopsy-proven COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains (pernio) in a paucisymptomatic patient with a brisk perieccrine lymphocytic response. Based on an antecedent pathological study, we know coronavirus particles have been seen in the eccrine gland associated with a brisk peri-inflammatory response. The prominent perieccrine inflammation is helpful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections. Currently, nonischemic pathological findings correlate with a good prognosis based on the paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic nature of their disease courses. Patients presenting with suspected COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains who are paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic should be isolated and immediately tested with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing (as there is a delay in diagnosis based on the poor sensitivity of the current rapid test).

Modeling of this effect is highly necessary as it will help to predict the possible impact on the overall population. The nonlinear incidence rate is the best approach to modeling this effect. At the first step, the model is formulated by using a nonlinear incidence rate with inclusion of the crowding effect, then its positivity and proposed boundedness will be addressed leading to model dynamics using the reproductive number.

Capitalizing on a 29-year longitudinal study with four previous assessments, two groups of Israeli veterans - ex-Prisoners-of-War (ex-POWs) of the 1973 Yom Kippur War and comparable combat veterans of the same war - were reassessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous data were collected on their PTSD trajectory 18, 30, 35, and 42 years after the war and exposure to stressful life events after the war. Currently, we collected data on their PTSD during the COVID-19 pandemic and their appraisal of similarities of past trauma with the current pandemic. Previously traumatized ex-POWs were found to be more vulnerable and had significantly higher rates of PTSD and more intense PTSD during the current pandemic than comparable combat veterans. Moreover, veterans in both groups who perceived the current adversity (captivity, combat) as hindering their current coping were more likely to suffer from PTSD than veterans who perceived it as a facilitating or irrelevant experience. In addition, chronic and delayed trajectories of PTSD among ex-POWs increased the risk for PTSD during the pandemic, and lifetime PTSD mediated the effects of war captivity on PTSD during the current pandemic. These findings support the stress resolution perspective indicating that the response to previous trauma - PTSD and its trajectories - increased the risk of PTSD following subsequent exposure to stress.","Solomon, Zahava; Mikulincer, Mario; Ohry, Avi; Ginzburg, Karni",J Psychiatr Res,579,16

However, its impact is clearly inherent to the local stroke network conditions. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on acute stroke care in the Lyon comprehensive stroke center during this period. METHODS: We conducted a prospective data collection of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and/or mechanical thrombectomy (MT) during the COVID-19 period (from 29/02/2020 to 10/05/2020) and a control period (from 29/02/2019 to 10/05/2019). The volume of reperfusion therapies and pre and intra-hospital delays were compared during both periods. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients were included. The volume of IVT significantly decreased during the COVID-period [55 (54.5%) vs 74 (69.2%); p = 0.03]. The volume of MT remains stable over the two periods [72 (71.3%) vs 65 (60.8%); p = 0.14], but the door-to-groin puncture time increased in patients transferred for MT (237 [187-339] vs 210 [163-260]; p < 0.01). The daily number of Emergency Medical Dispatch calls considerably increased (1502 [1133-2238] vs 1023 [960-1410]; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a decrease in the volume of IVT, whereas the volume of MT remained stable although intra-hospital delays increased for transferred patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results contrast in part with the national surveys and suggest that the impact of the pandemic may depend on local stroke care networks.","Plumereau, Cécile; Cho, Tae-Hee; Buisson, Marielle; Amaz, Camille; Cappucci, Matteo; Derex, Laurent; Ong, Elodie; Fontaine, Julia; Rascle, Lucie; Riva, Roberto; Schiavo, David; Benhamed, Axel; Douplat, Marion; Bony, Thomas; Tazarourte, Karim; Tuttle, Célia; Eker, Omer Faruk; Berthezène, Yves; Ovize, Michel; Nighoghossian, Norbert; Mechtouff, Laura",J. neurol,579,16

We also performed a bridging study comparing the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay with the new Abbott Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay. A number of standards, reference materials, and commercially available controls were used for the analytical verification to confirm the limit of detection, linearity, and reproducibility. We used nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens collected in saline for the clinical verification and bridging studies. Overall, we found 91.2% positive percent agreement (PPA) (95% CI 76.2 to 98.14%) and a 100% negative percent agreement (NPA) (95% CI 97.97 to 100%) between the results of the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 and CDC tests with 217 NP specimens (P=0.13). We found a PPA of 100% (95% CI 90.26 to 100%) and a NPA of 95.15% (95% CI 83.47 to 99.4%) between the results of the RealTime and TaqPath tests with 77 NP specimens (P=0.24).

Postmortem investigations reveal renal involvement in COVID-19, and most recently, several biopsy researches reveal that acute tubular injury, as well as glomerular nephropathy such as collapsing glomerulopathy were common histological findings. However, to our best knowledge, there is limited data regarding IgA nephropathy in the setting of COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: In the present case, we report a 65-year old Chinese woman who presented with dark-colored urine, worsening proteinuria and decreased renal function after COVID-19 infection. She received a renal biopsy during COVID-19 infection. The renal biopsy revealed IgA nephropathy without any evidence for SARS-Cov-2. The findings suggest that the renal abnormalities were a consequence of exacerbation of this patient's underlying glomerular disease after COVID-19 infection. After a regimen of 3-day course of glucocorticoid and angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy, the patient recovered and remained stable upon follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to consider the underlying glomerular disease exacerbation as well as virus induced injury when dealing with renal abnormalities in patients with COVID-19.

Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproduction number $R_{0}$ is derived. When $R_{0}<1$, the disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When $R_{0}>1$, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in the United States is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model. According to the real data of the United States, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the United States in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated cases are predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the development process of COVID-19, which provides an important reference for understanding the trend of the outbreak.","Xu, Conghui; Yu, Yongguang; Yang, QuanChen; Lu, Zhenzhen",,579,24

This review provides an update on significant issues relevant to the inpatient management of T1D. Topics include trends in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypoglycemia, and adapting ambulatory technologies for inpatient use. RECENT FINDINGS: Rates of DKA in the United States are rising. Although socioeconomic status, health insurance coverage, and hemoglobin A1c are persistently associated with DKA in individuals with T1D, newer risk factors have also emerged. These include the off-label use of sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitor medications, immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diabetes, and infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Hypoglycemia is common among hospitalized patients with T1D. Use of validated hypoglycemia risk prediction models and multidisciplinary care initiatives can reduce the risk of inpatient hypoglycemia. Finally, continuous glucose monitoring is being adapted for use in the hospital setting and has shown promise during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Comparison of methodological and reporting quality of covid-19 and other research from the first wave of the pandemic,16.588455,4.83179,2021,"BACKGROUND: Between March and December, 2020, more than 20 000 laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported in Zambia. However, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is likely to be higher than the confirmed case counts because many infected people have mild or no symptoms, and limitations exist with regard to testing capacity and surveillance systems in Zambia. We aimed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in six districts of Zambia in July, 2020, using a population-based household survey. METHODS: Between July 4 and July 27, 2020, we did a cross-sectional cluster-sample survey of households in six districts of Zambia. Within each district, 16 standardised enumeration areas were randomly selected as primary sampling units using probability proportional to size. 20 households from each standardised enumeration area were selected using simple random sampling. All members of selected households were eligible to participate. Consenting participants completed a questionnaire and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time PCR (rtPCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using ELISA. Prevalence estimates, adjusted for the survey design, were calculated for each diagnostic test separately, and combined. We applied the prevalence estimates to census population projections for each district to derive the estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. FINDINGS: Overall, 4258 people from 1866 households participated in the study. The median age of participants was 18·2 years (IQR 7·7-31·4) and 50·6% of participants were female. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence for the combined measure was 10·6% (95% CI 7·3-13·9). The rtPCR-positive prevalence was 7·6% (4·7-10·6) and ELISA-positive prevalence was 2·1% (1·1-3·1). An estimated 454 708 SARS-CoV-2 infections (95% CI 312 705-596 713) occurred in the six districts between March and July, 2020, compared with 4917 laboratory-confirmed cases reported in official statistics from the Zambia National Public Health Institute. INTERPRETATION: The estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections was much higher than the number of reported cases in six districts in Zambia. The high rtPCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was consistent with observed community transmission during the study period. The low ELISA-positive SARS-CoV-2 prevalence might be associated with mitigation measures instituted after initial cases were reported in March, 2020. Zambia should monitor patterns of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and promote measures that can reduce transmission.

We have used RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling to investigate holistically the transcriptional and translational response to cellular infection by murine hepatitis virus (MHV), often used as a model for the Betacoronavirus genus to which the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 also belongs. We found the UPR to be amongst the most significantly up-regulated pathways in response to MHV infection. To confirm and extend these observations, we show experimentally the induction of all three branches of the UPR in both MHV- and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Over-expression of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 or S proteins alone is itself sufficient to induce the UPR. Remarkably, pharmacological inhibition of the UPR greatly reduced the replication of both MHV and SARS-CoV-2, revealing the importance of this pathway for successful coronavirus replication. This was particularly striking when both IRE1&#945; and ATF6 branches of the UPR were inhibited, reducing SARS-CoV-2 virion release (~1,000-fold).

In this work, we conducted a systematic review of recent literature to investigate reactivation and reinfection among the discharged COVID-19 patients that are found positive again. Our study, consisting more than a total of 113,715 patients, indicates that the RP-SARS-CoV-2 scenario occurs plausibly due to reactivation, reinfection, viral shedding, or testing errors. Nonetheless, we observe that previously infected individuals have significantly lower risk of being infected for the second time, indicating that reactivation or reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 likely have relatively less impact in the general population than the primary infection.","Tang, Xiujuan; Musa, Salihu S; Zhao, Shi; He, Daihai",Front Public Health,579,18

Late administration is commonly regarded as a major cause of treatment failure but the optimal timing for anti-cytokine therapy initiation in COVID-19 patients has never been clearly established. Objectives: To identify a window of therapeutic opportunity for maximizing the efficacy of interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 blockade in COVID-19. Methods: Survival at the longest available follow-up was assessed in severe hyper-inflamed COVID-19 patients treated with anakinra, tocilizumab, sarilumab, or standard of care, stratified according to respiratory impairment at the time of treatment initiation. Results: 107 patients treated with biologics and 103 contemporary patients treated with standard of care were studied. After a median of 106 days of follow-up (range 3-186), treatment with biologics was associated with a significantly higher survival rate compared to standard therapy when initiated in patients with a PaO2/FiO2 &#8805; 100 mmHg (p < 0.001). Anakinra reduced mortality also in patients with PaO2/FiO2 < 100 mmHg (p = 0.04).

We evaluated the contribution of C-type lectin receptors (CLRS) of antigen-presenting cells, widely present in respiratory mucosa and lung tissue. DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, Langerin and MGL bind to diverse glycans of the spike using multiple interaction areas. Using pseudovirus and cells derived from monocytes or T-lymphocytes, we demonstrate that while virus capture by the CLRs examined does not allow direct cell infection, DC/L-SIGN, among these receptors, promote virus transfer to permissive ACE2+ Vero E6 cells. A glycomimetic compound designed against DC-SIGN, enable inhibition of this process. These data have been then confirmed using authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus and human respiratory cell lines. Thus, we described a mechanism potentiating viral spreading of infection.","Thépaut, Michel; Luczkowiak, Joanna; Vivès, Corinne; Labiod, Nuria; Bally, Isabelle; Lasala, Fátima; Grimoire, Yasmina; Fenel, Daphna; Sattin, Sara; Thielens, Nicole; Schoehn, Guy; Bernardi, Anna; Delgado, Rafael; Fieschi, Franck",PLoS Pathog,579,24

METHODS: In this ongoing, double-blind, phase 1-3 trial involving nonhospitalized patients with Covid-19, we investigated two fully human, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein, used in a combined cocktail (REGN-COV2) to reduce the risk of the emergence of treatment-resistant mutant virus. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive placebo, 2.4 g of REGN-COV2, or 8.0 g of REGN-COV2 and were prospectively characterized at baseline for endogenous immune response against SARS-CoV-2 (serum antibody-positive or serum antibody-negative). Key end points included the time-weighted average change in viral load from baseline (day 1) through day 7 and the percentage of patients with at least one Covid-19-related medically attended visit through day 29. Safety was assessed in all patients. RESULTS: Data from 275 patients are reported. The least-squares mean difference (combined REGN-COV2 dose groups vs. placebo group) in the time-weighted average change in viral load from day 1 through day 7 was -0.56 log10 copies per milliliter (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.02 to -0.11) among patients who were serum antibody-negative at baseline and -0.41 log10 copies per milliliter (95% CI, -0.71 to -0.10) in the overall trial population. In the overall trial population, 6% of the patients in the placebo group and 3% of the patients in the combined REGN-COV2 dose groups reported at least one medically attended visit; among patients who were serum antibody-negative at baseline, the corresponding percentages were 15% and 6% (difference, -9 percentage points; 95% CI, -29 to 11). The percentages of patients with hypersensitivity reactions, infusion-related reactions, and other adverse events were similar in the combined REGN-COV2 dose groups and the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: In this interim analysis, the REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail reduced viral load, with a greater effect in patients whose immune response had not yet been initiated or who had a high viral load at baseline. Safety outcomes were similar in the combined REGN-COV2 dose groups and the placebo group.

The molecular details of the early steps in NMD are not fully understood but previous work suggests that NMD activation occurs as a consequence of ribosome stalling at the termination codon (TC). To test this hypothesis, we established an in vitro translation-coupled toeprinting assay based on lysates from human cells that allows monitoring of ribosome occupancy at the TC of reporter mRNAs. In contrast to the prevailing NMD model, our in vitro system reveals similar ribosomal occupancy at the stop codons of NMD-sensitive and NMD-insensitive reporter mRNAs. Moreover, ribosome profiling reveals a similar density of ribosomes at the TC of endogenous NMD-sensitive and NMD-insensitive mRNAs in vivo. Together, these data show that NMD activation is not accompanied by stable stalling of ribosomes at TCs.","Karousis, Evangelos D; Gurzeler, Lukas-Adrian; Annibaldis, Giuditta; Dreos, René; Mühlemann, Oliver",Nat Commun,579,24

However, not all viruses affect patients in the same manner and extent. The pandemic of the SARS CoV-2 virus has brought interest to study the association of this novel virus on patients with mild-moderate and severe asthma in terms of susceptibility, severity and treatment. DATA SOURCES ­ STUDY SELECTION: We performed an extensive search of current literature in the databases PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar for original articles. We decided to include all types of articles, except for case studies, published until the end of February 2021 focusing on the effects of COVID-19 on the respiratory system and the main treatment recommendations up to date for patients with bronchial asthma. RESULTS: Until now there is no clear evidence that asthmatics have a higher risk of experiencing exacerbations when infected, nor higher mortality rates than the general population. Nevertheless, our knowledge on molecular pathways behind asthma phenotypes in the past decades is growing, and it underlines the need to predict the unique response each patient may have to infection from the novel coronavirus. It is not clear yet if certain sub-populations of asthmatics are at higher risk than others. CONCLUSION: Despite the lack of evidence for higher susceptibility and/or mortality in relation to COVID-19, all asthmatic patients, whether treated with inhaled bronchodilators/corticosteroids or even biologics, should maintain their controller therapy without making any alterations.","Bakakos, Agamemnon; Krompa, Anastasia",J Asthma,579,6

Even patients infected by SARS-CoV­2 or COVID-19 may need operative procedures. Currently, no uniform recommendations exist on precautions to be taken when operating on these patients. Furthermore, they may differ from one hospital to another. METHODS: The task force COVID-19 of the emergency, intensive and severely injured section of the German Trauma Society (DGU e.â¯V.) has developed consensus-based recommendations on surgical treatment of patients with SARS-CoV­2 infections. Great importance is placed on the implementation in hospitals at all levels of care. RESULTS: The indications for surgical interventions in patients with COVID-19 infections require an extremely critical evaluation. When indicated these surgical intervention should ideally be performed in a separate operating theater. All personnel involved should wear personal protective equipment with FFP2 masks, face shields and double gloves. The emergency team in the resuscitation bay should generally wear the same personal protective equipment. Special training is mandatory and the exposure of team members should be minimized. CONCLUSION: The recommendations are principally used for all kinds of surgery and comply with the currently available knowledge. Nevertheless, all recommendations represent a compromise between maximum safety of all medical staff and practicability in the routine hospital workflow.","Mahlke, Lutz; Flohé, Sascha; Matthes, Gerrit; Paffrath, Thomas; Wagner, Frithjof; Wölfl, Christoph",Unfallchirurg,579,20

Supervised injecting facilities and drug consumption rooms across the world have been particularly challenged during the pandemic, as have their client group-people who consume drugs. Several services across Europe and North America closed due to difficulties complying with physical distancing requirements. In contrast, the two supervised injecting facilities in Australia (the Uniting Medically Supervised Injecting Centre-MSIC-in Sydney and the North Richmond Community Health Medically Supervised Injecting Room-MSIR-in Melbourne) remained open (as at the time of writing-December 2020). Both services have implemented a comprehensive range of strategies to continue providing safer injecting spaces as well as communicating crucial health information and facilitating access to ancillary services (such as accommodation) and drug treatment for their clients. This paper documents these strategies and the challenges both services are facing during the pandemic. Remaining open poses potential risks relating to COVID-19 transmission for both staff and clients. However, given the harms associated with closing these services, which include the potential loss of life from injecting in unsafe/unsupervised environments, the public and individual health benefits of remaining open are greater. Both services are deemed 'essential health services', and their continued operation has important benefits for people who inject drugs in Sydney and Melbourne.","Roxburgh, Amanda; Jauncey, Marianne; Day, Carolyn; Bartlett, Mark; Cogger, Shelley; Dietze, Paul; Nielsen, Suzanne; Latimer, Julie; Clark, Nico",Harm Reduct J,579,1

Clinical signs included apathy, dark and fetid diarrhea, and crusted lesions on the palmar pads of the fore and hind limbs. The animal died after undergoing support treatment with antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, and fluid therapy. At necropsy, the intestines were reddened and edematous and the right kidney was diminished by one third of its normal size and covered with whitish, spongy material. A female Dioctophyma renale was found free in the abdominal cavity. Histologically, dilatation of the intestinal crypts and fusion and blunting of the intestinal villi were observed. In addition, moderate, multifocal lymphocytic enteritis with lymphoid depletion in Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes were present. Immunohistochemistry with anti-canine parvovirus monoclonal antibody (anti-CPV) was strongly positive in the bone marrow cells and enterocytes of the intestinal crypts, confirming the diagnosis of parvovirus infection. The peritoneum on the right kidney was expanded with a cuboidal cell border, forming multiple papillary projections associated with eggs of D. renale and severe inflammatory infiltrate (giant cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells). Areas of necrosis and mineralization were also observed. Due to fragmentation and degradation of its natural habitat, the otter approached the urban area and was contaminated with the virus, which is hosted and disseminated by domestic animals. Infection with D. renale can be associated with the large population of parasitized domestic animals, which eliminate the helminth eggs through urine, contaminating the environment where the parasite intermediate and paratenic hosts co-inhabit. The diseases of these animals can be a decline factor of wild populations that inhabit the region and are an alert to spillover risk.(AU)","Echenique, Joanna V.

METHODS: HCWs at Helsinki University Hospital, Finland, filled in questionnaires and provided serum samples for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody screening by Euroimmun IgG assay in March-April 2020. Positive/equivocal findings were confirmed by Abbott and microneutralization tests. Positivity by two of the three assays or RT-PCR indicated a Covid-19 case (CoV+). RESULTS: The rate of CoV(+) was 3.3% (36/1095) and seropositivity 3.0% (33/1095). CoV(+) was associated with contact with a known Covid-19 case, and working on a Covid-19-dedicated ward or one with cases among staff. The rate in the Covid-19-dedicated ICU was negligible. Smoking and age <55 years were associated with decreased risk. CoV(+) was strongly associated with ageusia, anosmia, myalgia, fatigue, fever, and chest pressure. Seropositivity was recorded for 89.3% of those with prior documented RT-PCR-positivity and 2.4% of those RT-PCR-negative. The rate of previously unidentified cases was 0.7% (8/1067) and asymptomatic ones 0% (0/36). CONCLUSION: Undiagnosed and asymptomatic cases among HCWs proved rare. An increased risk was associated with Covid-19-dedicated wards. Particularly high rates were seen for wards with liberal HCW-HCW contacts, highlighting the importance of social distancing also among HCWs.","Kantele, Anu; Lääveri, Tinja; Kareinen, Lauri; Pakkanen, Sari H; Blomgren, Karin; Mero, Sointu; Patjas, Anu; Virtanen, Jenni; Uusitalo, Ruut; Lappalainen, Maija; Järvinen, Asko; Kurkela, Satu; Jääskeläinen, Anne J; Vapalahti, Olli; Sironen, Tarja",Travel Med Infect Dis,579,20

Given the large number of patients affected, healthcare personnel and facility resources are stretched to the limit; however, the need for urgent and emergent neurosurgical care continues. This article describes best practices when performing neurosurgical procedures on patients with COVID-19 based on multi-institutional experiences. METHODS: We assembled neurosurgical practitioners from 13 different health systems from across the USA, including those in hot spots, to describe their practices in managing neurosurgical emergencies within the COVID-19 environment. RESULTS: Patients presenting with neurosurgical emergencies should be considered as persons under investigation (PUI) and thus maximal personal protective equipment (PPE) should be donned during interaction and transfer. Intubations and extubations should be done with only anesthesia staff donning maximal PPE in a negative pressure environment. Operating room (OR) staff should enter the room once the air has been cleared of particulate matter. Certain OR suites should be designated as covid ORs, thus allowing for all neurosurgical cases on covid/PUI patients to be performed in these rooms, which will require a terminal clean post procedure. Each COVID OR suite should be attached to an anteroom which is a negative pressure room with a HEPA filter, thus allowing for donning and doffing of PPE without risking contamination of clean areas. CONCLUSION: Based on a multi-institutional collaborative effort, we describe best practices when providing neurosurgical treatment for patients with COVID-19 in order to optimize clinical care and minimize the exposure of patients and staff.","Pandey, Aditya S; Ringer, Andrew J; Rai, Ansaar T; Kan, Peter; Jabbour, Pascal; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I; Snyder, Kenneth V; Riina, Howard; Tanweer, Omar; Levitt, Michael R; Kim, Louis J; Veznedaroglu, Erol; Binning, Mandy J; Arthur, Adam S; Mocco, J; Schirmer, Clemens; Thompson, Byron Gregory; Langer, David",J Neurointerv Surg,579,29

Methods: We tested the ability of food-grade silica bead packets to accelerate moisture removal from N95s during 24-hour time periods. Results: Briefly, N95s sprayed with water were completely dehydrated by silica beads within 24 hours, as measured with a commercial moisture meter. Importantly, repeated wetting and drying (with silica) did not decrease the N95 ability to exclude the bitter taste of Bitrex during standard fit testing. Conclusions: We conclude that food-grade silica beads can desiccate wet N95s over 24 hours, removing moisture.","Woolverton, Christopher J.; Peeps, Craig; Seidel, Joan; Eng, Abbey",Appl.

This meta‐analysis examines the impact of students' use of technology that personalises and adapts to learning level in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Following a systematic search for research between 2007 and 2020, 16 randomised controlled trials were identified in five countries. Studies involved 53,029 learners aged 6–15 years. Coding examined learning domain (mathematics and literacy);personalisation level and delivery;technology use;and intervention duration and intensity. Overall, technology‐supported personalised learning was found to have a statistically significant—if moderate—positive effect size of 0.18 on learning (p = 0.001). Meta‐regression reveals how more personalised approaches which adapt or adjust to learners' level led to significantly greater impact (an effect size of 0.35) than those only linking to learners' interests or providing personalised feedback, support, and/or assessment. Avenues for future research include investigating cost implications, optimum programme length, and teachers' role in making personalised learning with technology effective. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? Promoting personalised learning is an established aim of educators. Using technology to support personalised learning in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) could play an important role in ensuring more inclusive and equitable access to education, particularly in the aftermath of COVID‐19. There is currently no rigorous overview of evidence on the effectiveness of using technology to enable personalised learning in LMICs. What this paper adds? The meta‐analysis is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of technology‐supported personalised learning in improving learning outcomes for school‐aged children in LMICs. Technology‐supported personalised learning has a statistically significant, positive effect on learning outcomes. Interventions are similarly effective for mathematics and literacy and whether or not teachers also have an active role in the personalisation. Personalised approaches that adapt or adjust to the learner led to significantly greater impact, although whether these warrant the additional investment likely necessary for implementation at scale needs to be investigated. Personalised technology implementation of moderate duration and intensity had similar positive effects to that of stronger duration and intensity, although further research is needed to confirm this. Implications for practice and/or policy: The inclusion of more adaptive personalisation features in technology‐assisted learning environments can lead to greater learning gains. Personalised technology approaches featuring moderate personalisation may also yield learning rewards. While it is not known whether personalised technology can be scaled in a cost‐effective and contextually appropriate way, there are indications that this is possible. The appropriateness of teachers integrating personalised approaches in their practice should be explored given ‘supplementary’ uses of personalised technology (ie, additional sessions involving technology outside of regular instruction) are common.

Accordingly, characteristics of households in a region have been shown to relate to transmission heterogeneity of the virus. We introduce a discrete-time stochastic epidemiological model to examine the impact of the household size distribution in a region on the transmission dynamics. We choose parameters to reflect incidence in two health regions of the Greater Vancouver area in British Columbia and simulate the impact of distancing measures on transmission, with household size distribution the only different parameter between simulations for the two regions. Our result suggests that the dissimilarity in household size distribution alone can cause significant differences in incidence of the two regions, and the distributions drive distinct dynamics that match reported cases. Furthermore, our model suggests that offering individuals a place to isolate outside their household can speed the decline in cases, and does so more effectively where there are more larger households.","Liu, Pengyu; McQuarrie, Lisa; Song, Yexuan; Colijn, Caroline",J R Soc Interface,579,16

In some circumstances, virtual care initiatives have been shown to increase health disparities, as individuals from underserved communities are less likely to benefit from such initiatives. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to describe a protocol for a scoping review of reviews that aims to map review-level evidence that describes challenges and strategies for promoting effective engagement with virtual care technologies among underserved communities. METHODS: Our methodology was adapted from seminal scoping review guidelines provided by Arksey and O'Malley, Levac at al, Colquhoun et al, and the Joanna Briggs Institute. Our search strategy was developed for the following databases: MEDLINE (on Ovid), EMBASE (on Ovid), CINAHL (on EBSCO), Scopus, and Epistemonikos. Supplementary searches will include the use of Google Scholar and reference tracking. Each citation will be independently screened by 2 researchers at the title and abstract level, and full-text screening will be performed in accordance with our eligibility criteria. The eligibility criteria focused on the inclusion of methods-driven reviews (ie, systematic reviews, scoping reviews, meta-analyses, realist reviews, and critical interpretative syntheses) to enhance rigor and quality. Other inclusion criteria included a focus on virtual care services that facilitate bidirectional patient-provider communication (ie, video, telephone, and asynchronous messaging visits) for underserved populations (ie, those who experience social disadvantage due to race, age, income, and other factors related to the social determinants of health). RESULTS: This scoping review of reviews will provide a broad overview of identified challenges associated with the accessibility of virtual health care services among underserved communities. In addition, strategies for improving the access to, uptake of, and engagement with virtual care technologies among underserved communities will be identified. The knowledge synthesized from this review will aid in developing and implementing virtual services that acknowledge the unique needs of populations who experience barriers to care and disproportionately worse health outcomes. The results will also inform gaps in current research. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid shift toward virtual health services has highlighted the urgent need to critically examine the intersection of virtual care and health equity. Although technology-driven innovations in health care generally aim to improve access, quality, and health outcomes, it is also possible for these innovations to produce intervention-generated inequities. Assessing current review-level evidence on the key challenges and strategies for improving the application of virtual care in underserved communities is imperative for ensuring that virtual care benefits all populations.

Therefore, it is urgent to design an effective approach to enhance the osteogenic property and restrict bacterial activity. In this study, a layered double hydroxide (LDH) composed of Ga and Sr ions on Ti substrates by a hydrothermal method, then calcined in 250°C and denoted as LDH250. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were confirmed that the LDH films were successfully formed on the Ti substrates. Importantly, the obtained LDH films can induce an alkaline microenvironment around the Ti surface and regulate the behaviors of osteogenic cells and bacteria. In vitro cellular experiments, the LDH250 can enhance the differentiation of both MC3T3-E1 cells and osteoblasts, stimulate alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), collagen secretion, and mineralization levels. Meanwhile, antimicrobial assay against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) demonstrated that the LDH250 samples had strong antibacterial abilities, which attributed to the release profile of Ga3+ could act as a ""Trojan horse"" to destroy the bacterial iron metabolism, inducing of local alkaline environment, and producing reactive oxygen species. Hence, this study provides an effective method for reducing antibacterial infection and enhancing the bone integrative capacity of Ti-based implants for orthopedic applications.","Li, Kai; Tian, Hongchuan; Guo, Ai; Jin, Liguo; Chen, Weizhen; Tao, Bailong",J. biomed. mater. res.

Over the past decade, the overall incidence of LVFWR has decreased given the advancements in reperfusion therapies. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant delay in hospital presentation of patients suffering myocardial infarctions, leading to a higher incidence of mechanical complications from myocardial infarctions such as LVFWR. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case in which a patient suffered a LVFWR as a mechanical complication from myocardial infarction due to delay in seeking care over fear of contracting COVID-19 from the medical setting. The patient had been having chest pain for a few days but refused to seek medical care due to fear of contracting COVID-19 from within the medical setting. He eventually suffered a cardiac arrest at home from a massive inferior myocardial infarction and found to be in cardiac tamponade from a left ventricular perforation. He was emergently taken to the operating room to attempt to repair the rupture but he ultimately expired on the operating table. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of LVFWR has been on a more significant rise over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as patients delay seeking care over fear of contracting COVID-19 from within the medical setting. Clinicians should consider mechanical complications of MI when patients present as an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as delay in seeking care is often the exacerbating factor.","Nasr, George H; Glovaci, Diana; Mikhail, Andrew; Sinfield, Steven; Chen, Kevin; Patel, Hardikkumar; Johl, Michael; Chakravarthy, Bharath; Singh, Siddharth; Sagebin, Fabio; El-Farra, Ailin Barseghian",J Cardiothorac Surg,579,30

RESULTS: Older adults reported higher depression and greater loneliness following the onset of the pandemic. Loneliness positively predicted depression. Perceived relationship strength, but not social engagement, moderated this relationship such that loneliness only predicted depression for individuals who became closer to their networks during the pandemic. For those who felt less close, depression was higher irrespective of loneliness.

The eponym recognises the 19th-century physicians William Osler, Henri Jules Louis Marie Rendu and Frederick Parkes Weber who each independently described the disease. It is characterised by epistaxis, telangiectasia and visceral arteriovenous malformations. Individuals with HHT have been found to have abnormal plasma concentrations of transforming growth factor beta and vascular endothelial growth factor secondary to mutations in ENG, ACVRL1 and MADH4. Pulmonary artery malformations (PAVMs) are abnormal communications between pulmonary arteries and veins and are found in up to 50% of individuals with HHT. The clinical features suggestive of PAVMs are stigmata of right to left shunting such as dyspnoea, hypoxaemia, cyanosis, cerebral embolism and unexplained haemoptysis or haemothorax. The authors present the case of a 33-year-old woman presenting with progressive dyspnoea during the COVID-19 pandemic. She had a typical presentation of HHT with recurrent epistaxis, telangiectasia and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations.

The pangolin, a species threatened with extinction due to poaching for both culinary purposes and traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia, is now suspected of being the “missing link” in the transmission to humans of a virus that probably originated in a species of bat. Our predation of wild fauna and the reduction in their habitats have thus ended up creating new interfaces that favour the transmission of pathogens (mainly viruses) to humans. Domesticated animals and wild fauna thus constitute a reservoir for almost 80% of emerging human diseases (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola). These diseases are all zoonotic in origin. As if out of a Chinese fairy tale, the bat and the pangolin have taught us a lesson: within an increasingly interdependent world, environmental crises will become ever more intertwined with health crises. Questions relating to public health will no longer be confined to the secrecy of the physician's consulting room or the sanitised environment of the hospital. They are now being played out in the arena of international trade, ports and airports and distribution networks. Simply put, all human activity creates new interfaces that facilitate the transmission of pathogens from an animal reservoir to humans. This pluri-disciplinary article highlights that environmental changes, such as the reduction in habitats for wild fauna and the intemperate trade in fauna, are the biggest causes of the emergence of new diseases. Against this background, it reviews the different measures taken to control, eradicate and prevent the emergence of animal diseases in a globalised world.","de Sadeleer, Nicolas; Godfroid, Jacques",Eur.

Evidence on the experience of those receiving or providing maternity care is important to guide practice through this challenging time. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Australia. Five key stakeholder cohorts were included to explore and compare the experiences of those receiving or providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women, their partners, midwives, medical practitioners and midwifery students who had received or provided maternity care from March 2020 onwards in Australia were recruited via social media and invited to participate in an online survey released between 13th May and 24th June 2020; a total of 3701 completed responses were received. FINDINGS: While anxiety related to COVID-19 was high among all five cohorts, there were statistically significant differences between the responses from each cohort for most survey items. Women were more likely to indicate concern about their own and family's health and safety in relation to COVID-19 whereas midwives, doctors and midwifery students were more likely to be concerned about occupational exposure to COVID-19 through working in a health setting than those receiving care through attending these environments. Midwifery students and women's partners were more likely to respond that they felt isolated because of the changes to the way care was provided. Despite concerns about care received or provided not meeting expectations, most respondents were satisfied with the quality of care provided, although midwives and midwifery students were less likely to agree. CONCLUSION: This paper provides a unique exploration and comparison of experiences of receiving and providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Findings are useful to support further service changes and future service redesign. New evidence provided offers unique insight into key stakeholders' experiences of the rapid changes to health services.","Bradfield, Zoe; Wynter, Karen; Hauck, Yvonne; Vasilevski, Vidanka; Kuliukas, Lesley; Wilson, Alyce N; Szabo, Rebecca A; Homer, Caroline S E; Sweet, Linda",PLoS One,579,16

The metabolism of polydatin, geniposide, quercitrin and glycyrrhizin was significantly inhibited by one or several anti-coronavirus drugs of 100 µM around 1 h and 4 h (P<0.05), among which darunavir could strongly reduce the production of genipin (70.6% reduction), quercitin (80.6% reduction) and glycyrrhetinic acid (37.9% reduction), which may cause a high risk of herb-drug interactions (HDI). Additionally, chloroquine reduced the production of genipin and quercitin by more than 75% (P<0.05), whereas arbidol had no significant influence on the metabolism of polydatin, quercitrin and glycyrrhizin (P>0.05) so that its risk may be lower. The inhibition of darunavir on ß-glucosidase was relatively strong (IC50 = 193±23 µM), and the inhibition became weaker on ß-glucuronidase and &#945;-rhamnosidase (IC50>500 µM). The consistency between gut microflora and glycosidase system indicated that the inhibition of darunavir on the activity of ß-glucosidase and ß-glucuronidase may be the main reason for affecting the metabolism of geniposide, glycyrrhizin and polydatin in gut microflora. However, for the inhibition of darunavir and chloroquine on the metabolism of quercetrin, there was no correlation between gut microflora and &#945;-rhamnosidase system. Assessing the risk of HDI mediated by glycosidases in gut microflora may be conducive to the safety and efficacy of combining traditional herbal and Western medicine for the treatment of patients with Covid-19.","Dai, Tianming; Wang, Min; Wang, Pengzhen; Dai, Libing; Dai, Renke; Meng, Qingqi",Pharmazie,579,1

Unlike the popular 3D pose estimation setting, the problem is often formulated as inside-out tracking based on embodied perception (e.g., egocentric cameras, handheld sensors). In this paper, we propose a new data-driven framework for inside-out body tracking, targeting challenges of omnipresent occlusions in optimization-based methods (e.g., inverse kinematics solvers). We first collect a large-scale motion capture dataset with both body and finger motions using optical markers and inertial sensors. This dataset focuses on social scenarios and captures ground truth poses under self-occlusions and body-hand interactions. We then simulate the occlusion patterns in head-mounted camera views on the captured ground truth using a ray casting algorithm and learn a deep neural network to infer the occluded body parts. In the experiments, we show that our method is able to generate high-fidelity embodied poses by applying the proposed method on the task of real-time inside-out body tracking, finger motion synthesis, and 3-point inverse kinematics.","Parger, Mathias; Tang, Chengcheng; Xu, Yuanlu; Twigg, Christopher; Tao, Lingling; Li, Yijing; Wang, Robert; Steinberger, Markus",,579,20

Interestingly, Emergency Department (ED) referrals for reasons other than Covid-19 seem to have declined steeply. In the present paper, we aimed to verify how the Covid-19 outbreak changed ED referral pattern. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients referred to the ED of a University Hospital in Northern Italy from 1st March to 13th April 2020. We compared the following data with those belonging to the same period in 2019: number of EDs accesses, rate of hospital admission, frequencies of the most common causes of ED referral, priority codes of access. RESULTS: The number of ED referrals during the Covid-19 outbreak was markedly reduced when compared to the same period in 2019 (3059 vs. 5691;-46.3%). Conversely, the rate of hospital admission raised from 16.9% to 35.4% (p<0.0001), with a shift toward higher priority codes of ED admission. In 2020, we observed both a reduction of the number of patients referred for both traumatic (513, 16.8% vs. 1544, 27.1%; &#967;2=118.7, p<0.0001) and non-traumatic (4147 vs. 2546) conditions. Among the latter, suspected Covid-19 accounted for 1101 (43.2%) accesses. CONCLUSIONS: The Covid-19 pandemic completely changed the pattern of ED referral in Italy, with a marked reduction of the accesses to the hospitals. This could be related to a limited exposure to traumas and to a common fear of being infected during EDs in-stay. This may limit the misuse of EDs for non- urgent conditions, but may also delay proper referrals for urgent conditions.","Bellan, Mattia; Gavelli, Francesco; Hayden, Eyal; Patrucco, Filippo; Soddu, Daniele; Pedrinelli, Anita R; Cittone, Micol G; Rizzi, Eleonora; Casciaro, Giuseppe F; Vassia, Veronica; Landi, Raffaella; Menegatti, Mirta; Gastaldello, Maria L; Beltrame, Michela; Labella, Emanuela; Tonello, Stelvio; Avanzi, Gian C; Pirisi, Mario; Castello, Luigi M; Sainaghi, Pier P",Panminerva med,579,16

Furthermore, many of these non-specific effects, as well as the pathogen-specific effects, of vaccines show differences between the sexes. Here, members of the Optimmunize consortium discuss the evidence for and potential mechanisms of non-specific and sex-differential effects of vaccines, as well as their potential policy implications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, international multicenter study, we reviewed the electronic medical records and imaging of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from March 3, 2020, to June 25, 2020. Our inclusion criteria were patients diagnosed with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with acute neurologic manifestations and available chest CT and brain imaging. The 5 lobes of the lungs were individually scored on a scale of 0-5 (0 corresponded to no involvement and 5 corresponded to >75% involvement). A CT lung severity score was determined as the sum of lung involvement, ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement). RESULTS: A total of 135 patients met the inclusion criteria with 132 brain CT, 36 brain MR imaging, 7 MRA of the head and neck, and 135 chest CT studies. Compared with 86 (64%) patients without acute abnormal findings on neuroimaging, 49 (36%) patients with these findings had a significantly higher mean CT lung severity score (9.9 versus 5.8, P < .001). These patients were more likely to present with ischemic stroke (40 [82%] versus 11 [13%], P < .0001) and were more likely to have either ground-glass opacities or consolidation (46 [94%] versus 73 [84%], P = .01) in the lungs. A threshold of the CT lung severity score of >8 was found to be 74% sensitive and 65% specific for acute abnormal findings on neuroimaging. The neuroimaging hallmarks of these patients were acute ischemic infarct (28%), intracranial hemorrhage (10%) including microhemorrhages (19%), and leukoencephalopathy with and/or without restricted diffusion (11%). The predominant CT chest findings were peripheral ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation. CONCLUSIONS: The CT lung disease severity score may be predictive of acute abnormalities on neuroimaging in patients with COVID-19 with neurologic manifestations. This can be used as a predictive tool in patient management to improve clinical outcome.","Mahammedi, A; Ramos, A; Bargalló, N; Gaskill, M; Kapur, S; Saba, L; Carrete, H; Sengupta, S; Salvador, E; Hilario, A; Revilla, Y; Sanchez, M; Perez-Nuñez, M; Bachir, S; Zhang, B; Oleaga, L; Sergio, J; Koren, L; Martin-Medina, P; Wang, L; Benegas, M; Ostos, F; Gonzalez-Ortega, G; Calleja, P; Udstuen, G; Williamson, B; Khandwala, V; Chadalavada, S; Woo, D; Vagal, A",AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,579,1

Healthcare professionals including dentists are facing real challenges during this pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and prevention measures of Lebanese dentists towards COVID-19 and determinants of high level of knowledge and prevention practices. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between May and August 2020 in Lebanon on a random sample of 323 Lebanese dentists. Data were collected through an online survey questionnaire. A multivariate linear regression model was used to evaluate factors associated with COVID-19 knowledge. A multivariate logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the factors associated with high level of prevention measures towards COVID-19. RESULTS: The mean COVID-19 knowledge index was 24.5 over 38 with only 15% achieving high knowledge level. The mean prevention measures index was 11.4 over 16 with only 35% achieving high prevention level. Higher knowledge index was associated with younger age, being employed, and considering dentist's role significant in teaching others about COVID-19. General dental practitioners, dentists living with family members and concerned about their family members to get infected because of their occupational exposure were more likely to report higher level of adopted prevention measures. Higher knowledge was associated with high level of prevention measures.

In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions such as closure of schools and national lockdowns. We study the impact of major interventions across 11 European countries for the period from the start of COVID-19 until the 4th of May 2020 when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of information between countries with both individual and shared effects on the reproduction number. Pooling allows more information to be used, helps overcome data idiosyncrasies, and enables more timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological parameters such as the infection fatality rate, does not include importation or subnational variation and assumes that changes in the reproduction number are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behavior. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that is incomplete, with systematic biases in reporting, and subject to future consolidation. We estimate that, for all the countries we consider, current interventions have been sufficient to drive the reproduction number [Formula: see text] below 1 (probability [Formula: see text]< 1.0 is 99.9%) and achieve epidemic control. We estimate that, across all 11 countries, between 12 and 15 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4th May, representing between 3.2% and 4.0% of the population.

METHODS: We used descriptive statistics to compare ED volume and rates of admission for patients presenting to the ED between January and early May of 2018, 2019, and 2020. RESULTS: Immediately after California's ""safer-at-home"" declaration, ED utilization dropped by 11,000 visits (37%) compared to the same nine weeks in prior years. The drop affected patients regardless of acuity, demographics, or diagnosis. Reductions were observed in the number of patients reporting symptoms often associated with COVID-19 and all other complaints. After the declaration, higher acuity, older, male, Black, uninsured or non-Medicaid, publicly insured, accounted for a disproportionate share of utilization. CONCLUSION: We show an abrupt, discontinuous impact of COVID-19 on ED utilization with a slow return as safer-at-home orders have lifted. It is imperative to determine how this reduction will impact patient outcomes, disease control, and the health of the community in the medium and long terms.","Lam, Chun Nok; Axeen, Sarah; Terp, Sophie; Burner, Elizabeth; Dworkis, Daniel A; Arora, Sanjay; Menchine, Michael",West J Emerg Med,579,24

We investigated whether use of low-dose aspirin, through initiation of LGIB, may lead patients to undergo colonoscopy and polypectomy before manifest CRC. DESIGN: We conducted a historical cohort study (2005-2013) of all Danish residents who initiated low-dose aspirin treatment (n=412 202) in a setting without screening for CRC. Each new aspirin user was matched with three non-users (n=1 236 560) by age, sex and region of residence on the date of their matched new user's first-time aspirin prescription (index date). We computed absolute risks (ARs), risk differences and relative risks (RRs) of LGIB, lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, colorectal polyps and CRC, comparing aspirin users with non-users. RESULTS: The ARs were higher for new users than non-users for LGIB, lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, colorectal polyps and CRC within 3 months after index. Comparing new users with non-users, the RRs were 2.79 (95% CI 2.40 to 3.24) for LGIB, 1.73 (95% CI 1.63 to 1.84) for lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, 1.56 (95% CI 1.42 to 1.72) for colorectal polyps and 1.73 (95% CI 1.51 to 1.98) for CRC. The RRs remained elevated for more than 12 months after the index date, with the exception of CRC where the RRs were slightly decreased during the 3-5 years (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.98) and more than 5 years (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00) following the index date. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that aspirin may contribute to reduce CRC risk by causing premalignant polyps to bleed, thereby expediting colonoscopy and polypectomy before CRC development.","Troelsen, Frederikke Schønfeldt; Farkas, Dóra Körmendiné; Erichsen, Rune; Sørensen, Henrik Toft",,579,24

Despite evidence of the effectiveness of government-mandated restrictions mitigating the spread of contagion, these orders are stigmatized due to undesirable economic consequences. This tradeoff resulted in state governments employing mandates at widely different ways. We compare the different policies states implemented during periods of restriction (""lockdown"") and reopening with indicators of COVID-19 spread and consumer card spending at each state during the first""wave""of the pandemic in the U.S. between March and August 2020. We find that while some states enacted reopening decisions when the incidence rate of COVID-19 was minimal or sustained in its relative decline, other states relaxed socioeconomic restrictions near their highest incidence and prevalence rates experienced so far. Nevertheless, all states experienced similar trends in consumer card spending recovery, which was strongly correlated with reopening policies following the lockdowns and relatively independent from COVID-19 incidence rates at the time. Our findings suggest that consumer card spending patterns can be attributed to government mandates rather than COVID-19 incidence in the states. This result highlights the important role of state policies in minimizing health impacts while promoting economic recovery and helps planning effective interventions in subsequent waves and immunization efforts.","Ligo, Alexandre K.; Mahoney, Emerson; Cegan, Jeffrey; Trump, Benjamin D.; Jin, Andrew S.; Kitsak, Maksim; Keenan, Jesse; Linkov, Igor",,579,24

The current study aimed to assess the knowledge; practices of Pakistani residents regarding COVID-19 and factors associated with adequate knowledge and positive practices. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 15-April 2020 to 20 May 2020 among 689 Pakistanis by using a validated self-administered questionnaire (Cronbach's alpha 0.77). The questionnaire included questions on the assessment of demographics, the source of information, knowledge, and practice of COVID-19 on google forms and shared links with the WhatsApp groups, Facebook pages and other online platforms. Regression analysis was applied to find potential predictors of knowledge and practices. Results: Of 689 participants, 431 (62.6%) were male, 64.3% (n = 443) were aged <30 years, and\328 (47.6%) of participants were married. 48.19% (n = 332) had adequate knowledge; 81% (n = 555) had positive practices regarding COVID-19 and majority (66.62%, n = 459) seek knowledge from social media. Knowledge was significantly higher (OR > 1.00, p < 0.05) among educated and higher income participants. Positive practices were significantly (OR > 1.00, p < 0.05) related to the older age (&#8805;50 years), higher education, higher income and good knowledge regarding COVID-19. Conclusion: The study concluded that Pakistani residents had average knowledge and good practices toward COVID-19 yet there are gaps in specific aspects of knowledge, and practice that should be focused in future awareness and educational campaigns. The study recommends the ministry of health authorities to promote all precautionary and preventive measures of COVID-19-consisting of a better-organized approach to all strata of society: less privileged people, older ones and less educated people, in order to have equilibrium of knowledge about COVID-19; hence effective implementation of precautionary measures.","Saqlain, Muhammad; Ahmed, Ali; Nabi, Ijaz; Gulzar, Aqsa; Naz, Sahar; Munir, Muhammad Muddasir; Ahmed, Zaheer; Kamran, Sohail",Front Public Health,579,13

We analyzed the impact of the use of CGRP antagonists in patients with migraine during the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. METHODS: This is a multicentre cross-sectional study. From May to November 2020, through a national survey distributed by the Spanish Society of Neurology, we collected data about the presence of COVID-19 symptoms including headache and their characteristics and severity in patients with migraine treated with anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (mAb), and compared them with patients with migraine not receiving this treatment. We also conducted a subanalysis of patients with COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: We recruited 300 patients with migraine: 51.7% (155/300) were taking anti-CGRP mAbs; 87.3% were women (262/300). Mean age (standard deviation) was 47.1 years (11.6). Forty-one patients (13.7%) met diagnostic criteria for COVID-19, with no statistically significant difference between patients with and without anti-CGRP mAb treatment (16.1% vs 11.0%, respectively; P=.320). Of the patients with COVID-19, 48.8% (20/41) visited the emergency department and 12.2% (5/41) were hospitalised. Likewise, no clinical differences were found between the groups of patients with and without anti-CGRP mAb treatment. CONCLUSION: Anti-CGRP mAbs may be safe in clinical practice, presenting no association with increased risk of COVID-19.","Caronna, E; José Gallardo, V; Alpuente, A; Torres-Ferrus, M; Sánchez-Mateo, N M; Viguera-Romero, J; López-Veloso, A C; López-Bravo, A; Gago-Veiga, A B; Irimia Sieira, P; Porta-Etessam, J; Santos-Lasaosa, S; Pozo-Rosich, P",,579,6

Methods: The protein targets related to COVID-19 were searched by literature mining and retrieving in DisGeNET, OMIM, KEGG and UniProt databases. With the aid of Traditional Chinese Medicine Network Pharmacology Intelligent Information Platform (TCMN) searching JOL chemical components and targets, the ""herb-compound-target network"" was constructed using Cytoscape-3.2.1 software to predict the main active ingredients and action targets of JOL in the treatment of COVID-19. The crystal structure of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) 3CL hydrolase (3CLpro) and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) was retrieved from the RCSB PDB database, and the active compounds were docked with the two proteins by using AutoDock Vina software. Results: The herb-compound-target network contained 75 compounds including isoglabrolide, peimisine, and sennoside B, etc., which are from the three medicinal materials of Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Rheum officinale, and Fritillaria ussuriensis, and 28 targets including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MEK1). Furthermore, nine key compounds (isoglabrolide, glabrolide, ebeiedinone, desoxo- glabrolid-acetate, peimisine, verticinone, imperialine, ussuriedinone and euchrenone A5) and 10 potential targets (mTOR, JAK3, ACE2, TNFA, AKT2, PIK3CA, MEK1, BRD2, ACE and ANPEP) of JOL were predicted for treating COVID-19 by network characteristic analysis. The molecular docking results showed that some core compounds of JOL had a certain degree of affinity for 3CLpro and ACE2. Conclusion: JOL may inhibit the occurrence and development of cytokine storm in COVID-19 by regulating the expression of Brd2, CD13, and ACE2 and interfering with the PI3K/Akt, Jak-STAT, TNF and MAPK signaling pathways, and inhibit virus replication by binding with 3CLpro, thus exerting a preventive or therapeutic effect on COVID-19.","Tao, Xiao-Qian; Ke, Zhi-Peng; Zhang, Xin-Zhuang; Deng, Yi; Cao, Ze-Yu; Cao, Liang; Wang, Zhen-Zhong; Xiao, Wei",Chin.

We also compared admission numbers in TOC and preCOV with the respective 2-month periods in 2018 and 2019 in a retrospective cohort analysis. Two investigators independently searched the hospital patient database for various forms of SE. There was no significant change in the 2-month incidences of first SE in the city of Salzburg from preCOV of 6.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9-12.3) to TOC of 6.9/100 000 adults (95% CI 3.4-13.3). Admission numbers did not differ significantly from previous years. Estimated adjusted incidence was in line with a recent 5-year epidemiological study in Salzburg. However, a trend toward less-frequent nonconvulsive SE (NCSE) and loss of female predominance were indirect hints of underdiagnosing SE. In contrast to other medical conditions, SE most often presents clinically with impaired consciousness, which may promote admission to emergency departments even in times of lock-down. Further research of medical support of women and patients with NCSE during pandemic-related restrictions is warranted.","Leitinger, Markus; Poppert, Kai-Nicolas; Mauritz, Matthias; Rossini, Fabio; Zimmermann, Georg; Rohracher, Alexandra; Kalss, Gudrun; Kuchukhidze, Giorgi; Höfler, Julia; Bosque Varela, Pilar; Kreidenhuber, Rudolf; Volna, Kamila; Neuray, Caroline; Kobulashvili, Teia; Granbichler, Claudia A; Siebert, Uwe; Trinka, Eugen",Epilepsia,579,16

A randomised sample of IBD patients (n=50) and all patients with both IBD and colorectal cancer (n=4) were compared to this standard. Results: Compliance to the audit standard within the population (n=54) was only 50%, and only 25% within sub-group with both IBD and Colorectal cancer (n=4). Conclusions: Only 4 cases of colorectal cancer within our IBD population were on record since 2012, suggesting incomplete patient identification, perhaps due to unreliable coding. The importance of optimising cancer screening programmes has only increased following the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. Compliance within the audit population (n=54) was only 50%, these findings promote a review of the screening process within the trust and advocate further complementary audits of additional NHS healthcare trusts.","Claxton, H.; Johnson, C.",British Journal of Surgery,579,16

The GWAS approach has been successfully applied to primary glomerular disorders, providing numerous novel insights into the genetic architecture of IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. IgA nephropathy appears to have a highly complex polygenic architecture, with nearly 20 genome-wide significant loci of small to moderate effects discovered to date. In contrast, the genetic susceptibility to membranous nephropathy and steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome appears to be driven by a small number of large-effect loci. The MHC locus on chromosome 6p21 is strongly associated with genetic susceptibility to all major types of immune-mediated glomerulopathies. However, a distinct set of classical HLA alleles is associated with each individual disease type, pinpointing to specific immune mechanisms underlying each of these conditions. Additional insights from the discovery of non-HLA risk loci reinforced the role of innate and adaptive immunity in the pathogenesis of these disorders, and highlighted important susceptibility overlaps between glomerular and other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Despite these initial successes, much larger GWAS and sequencing studies are still needed for each individual glomerular disease type. Increased power will be critical to comprehensively test for genetic effects across the full spectrum of allelic frequencies, to detect gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, and to potentially improve the performance of polygenic risk predictors. Moreover, the existing studies are limited mostly to Europeans and East Asians, stressing the urgency to expand genetic discovery efforts to more diverse populations worldwide.","Sanchez-Rodriguez, Elena; Southard, Christopher T; Kiryluk, Krzysztof",,579,12

The novel coronavirus pneumonia is a significant difference between the positive and negative patients with asymptomatic infections. To effectively improve the accuracy of doctors' manual judgment of positive and negative COVID-19, this paper proposes a deep classification network model of the novel coronavirus pneumonia based on convolution and deconvolution local enhancement. Through convolution and deconvolution operation, the contrast between the local lesion region and the abdominal cavity of COVID-19 is enhanced. Besides, the middle-level features that can effectively distinguish the image types are obtained. By transforming the novel coronavirus detection problem into the region of interest (ROI) feature classification problem, it can effectively determine whether the feature vector in each feature channel contains the image features of COVID-19. This paper uses an open-source COVID-CT dataset provided by Petuum researchers from the University of California, San Diego, which is collected from 143 novel coronavirus pneumonia patients and the corresponding features are preserved. The complete dataset (including original image and enhanced image) contains 1460 images. Among them, 1022 (70%) and 438 (30%) are used to train and test the performance of the proposed model, respectively. The proposed model verifies the classification precision in different convolution layers and learning rates. Besides, it is compared with most state-of-the-art models.

In Canada, over 80% of COVID-19 deaths during the first pandemic wave occurred in LTCFs. We sought to evaluate the effect of mitigation measures in LTCFs including frequent testing of staff, and vaccination of staff and residents. We developed an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with disease-specific estimates, temporal sensitivity of nasopharyngeal and saliva testing, results of vaccine efficacy trials, and data from initial COVID-19 outbreaks in LTCFs in Ontario, Canada. Characteristics of staff and residents, including contact patterns, were integrated into the model with age-dependent risk of hospitalization and death. Estimates of infection and outcomes were obtained and 95% credible intervals were generated using a bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method. Weekly routine testing of staff with 2-day turnaround time reduced infections among residents by at least 25.9% (95% CrI: 23.3%-28.3%), compared to baseline measures of mask-wearing, symptom screening, and staff cohorting alone.

Vaccination averted 2-4 times more infections in both staff and residents as compared to routine testing, and markedly reduced hospitalizations and deaths among residents by 95.9% (95% CrI: 95.4%-96.3%) and 95.8% (95% CrI: 95.5%-96.1%), respectively, over 200 days from the start of vaccination. Vaccination could have a substantial impact on mitigating disease burden among residents, but may not eliminate the need for other measures before population-level control of COVID-19 is achieved.","Vilches, Thomas N; Nourbakhsh, Shokoofeh; Zhang, Kevin; Juden-Kelly, Lyndon; Cipriano, Lauren E; Langley, Joanne M; Sah, Pratha; Galvani, Alison P; Moghadas, Seyed M",Prev Med,579,1

METHODS: This retrospective study included 549 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from 1st June to 15th July 2020 at Pak Emirates hospital, Rawalpindi Pakistan. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Median age was 60 years (range 12-94 years), males 442 (80.5%) and females 107 (19.5%). There was no patient with mild illness, 181 (32.9%) had moderate, 158 (28.7%) severe and 210 (38.2%) patients had critical disease. Patients with severe and critical disease had lower absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and platelets (p<0.001 for both) while higher white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and lactate dehydrogenase levels (LDH) levels (all p<0.001). Overall survival of study cohort was 83.2% (n=457). Median haemoglobin and platelet count were significantly lower (p<0.001) while WBC, ANC, NLR, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), ferritin, IL-6, LDH were significantly higher (p<0.001) for patients who died.

To achieve this, we implement a qualitative/quantitative technique called Q methodology. Our study was conducted with a carefully selected group of 31 experts from diverse areas related to the energy sector who were asked to rank-order their degree of agreement or disagreement with 30 key energy discourses (statements). The results of our analysis identify four profiles of stakeholders’ mindsets: the “Low-carbon”, the “Techies”, the “Skeptics”, and the “Trusting”. A well-defined integrative strategy could be identified which includes self-consumption using renewable energies, simplification of the administrative procedures, and promotion of the use of heat pumps, among others.

The findings demonstrated significant dyadic relationships between husbands and their pregnant wives' fear of COVID-19, mental health, and preventive behaviours. Pregnant wives' actor effect of fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours but not anxiety.

Methods: We performed a literature search of PubMed and EMBASE as of October 9, 2020. All articles relevant to either systemic or organ-specific autoimmune and rheumatic manifestations potentially associated with COVID-19 were collected. The reviewed literature were limited to adults &#8805;18 years. Results: Although most of the existing evidence was based on case reports or case series without a long-term follow-up, a variety of autoimmune/rheumatic manifestations were associated with COVID-19. The manifestations that have a consistent association with COVID-19 include autoimmune cytopenia, cutaneous vasculitis, encephalitis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Such association is conflicting as regards to antiphospholipid syndrome, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and myasthenia gravis.

We report our experience with stroke code imaging during the early pandemic months of 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of stroke codes during the 2020 pandemic and both 2020 and matched 2019 prepandemic months was performed. Patient variables were age, sex, hospital location, and severity of symptoms based on the NIHSS. We reviewed the results of CT of the head, CTA, CTP, and MR imaging examinations and classified a case as imaging-positive if any of the imaging studies yielded a result that related to the clinical indication for the study. Both year-to-year and sequential comparisons were performed between pandemic and prepandemic months. RESULTS: A statistically significant decrease was observed in monthly stroke code volumes accompanied by a statistically significant increased proportion of positive imaging findings during the pandemic compared with the same months in the prior year (P < .001) and prepandemic months in the same year (P < .001). We also observed statistically significant increases in average NIHSS scores (P = .045 and P = .03) and the proportion of inpatient stroke codes (P = .003 and P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: During our pandemic period, there was a significantly decreased number of stroke codes but simultaneous increases in positivity rates, symptom severity, and inpatient codes. We postulate that this finding reflects the documented reluctance of patients to seek medical care during the pandemic, with the shift toward a greater proportion of inpatient stroke codes potentially reflecting the neurologic complications of the virus itself.","Shatzkes, D R; Zlochower, A B; Steinklein, J M; Pramanik, B K; Filippi, C G; Azhar, S; Wang, J J; Sanelli, P C",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,579,16

Being affected by the disease exposes the individual to an uncertain prognosis and a state of quarantine. These factors can predispose individuals to the development of mental symptoms during or after the acute phase of the disease. There is a need for prospective studies assessing psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 patients in the post-infection period. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 tests were collected at patients' homes under the supervision of trained healthcare personnel. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were classified as mild cases (N = 895) at treatment intake were further assessed for the presence of psychiatric symptoms (on average, 56.6 days after the intake). We investigated the association between the number of COVID-19 symptoms at intake and depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms approximately two months later, adjusting for previous mental health status, time between baseline and outcome, and other confounders. Multivariate logistic regression and generalized linear models were employed for categorical and continuous outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: A clinically significant level of depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms were reported by 26.2% (N = 235), 22.4% (N = 201), and 17.3% (N = 155) of the sample. Reporting an increased number of COVID-related symptoms was associated with the presence of clinically significant levels of depressive (aOR = 1.059;95%CI = 1.002-1.119), anxiety (aOR = 1.072;95%CI = 1.012-1.134), and post-traumatic stress (aOR = 1.092;95%CI = 1.024-1.166) symptoms. Sensitivity analyses supported findings for both continuous and categorical measures. CONCLUSION: Exposure to an increased number of COVID-19 symptoms may be associated with depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms after the acute phase of the disease. These patients should be monitored for the development of psychiatric symptoms after COVID-19 treatment discharge. Early interventions, such as brief interventions of psychoeducation on coping strategies, could benefit these individuals.","Ismael, Flavia; Bizario, João C S; Battagin, Tatiane; Zaramella, Beatriz; Leal, Fabio E; Torales, Julio; Ventriglio, Antonio; Marziali, Megan E; Martins, Silvia S; Castaldelli-Maia, João M",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,579,26

The present study summarises data from the first 2 weeks of the study. METHODS: COVED is an ongoing prospective cohort study that commenced on 1 April 2020. It includes all adult patients presenting to a participating ED who undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2. Data are collected prospectively and entered into a bespoke registry. Outcomes include a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test result and requirement for intensive respiratory support. RESULTS: In the period 1-14 April 2020, 240 (16%) of 1508 patients presenting to The Alfred Emergency and Trauma Centre met inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 (5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The mean age of patients was 60 years and the commonest symptoms were acute shortness of breath (n = 122 [67%]), cough (n = 108 [56%]) or fever (n = 98 [51%]).

METHODS: 23 hospitalized severe/critical COVID-19 patients received 700mg leronlimab subcutaneously, repeated after seven days in 17/23 patients still hospitalized. 18/23 received other experimental treatments, including convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, steroids, and/or tocilizumab. 5/23 received leronlimab after blinded placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir, sarilumab, selinexor, or tocilizumab. Outcomes and results were extracted from medical records. RESULTS: Mean age was 69.5±14.9 years. 20/23 had significant co-morbidities. At baseline, 22/23 were receiving supplemental oxygen (3/23 high flow, 7/23 mechanical ventilation). Blood showed markedly elevated inflammatory markers (ferritin, D-dimer, C-reactive protein) and elevated neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio. By day 30 after initial dosing, 17/23 were recovered, 2/23 were still hospitalized, and 4/23 had died. Of the 7 intubated at baseline, 4/7 were fully recovered off oxygen, 2/7 were still hospitalized, and 1/7 had died. CONCLUSIONS: Leronlimab appeared safe and well tolerated. The high recovery rate suggested benefit, and those with lower inflammatory markers had better outcomes. Some but not all patients appeared to have dramatic clinical responses, indicating that unknown factors may determine responsiveness to leronlimab. Routine inflammatory and cell prognostic markers did not markedly change immediately after treatment, although IL-6 tended to fall. In some persons C-reactive protein clearly dropped only after the second leronlimab dose, suggesting that a higher loading dose might be more effective. Future controlled trials will be informative.","Yang, Bryant; Fulcher, Jennifer A; Ahn, Jenny; Berro, Marlene; Goodman-Meza, David; Dhody, Kush; Sacha, Jonah B; Naeim, Arash; Yang, Otto O",Clin. infect. dis,579,26

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to obtain insight into providers' satisfaction with services offered by health-system integrated specialty pharmacies and to determine whether providers' perceptions of services offered under an integrated model differ from perceptions of external specialty pharmacy services. METHODS: A multi-site, cross-sectional, online survey of specialty clinic healthcare providers at 10 academic health systems with integrated specialty pharmacies was conducted. The questionnaire was developed by members of the Vizient Specialty Pharmacy Outcomes and Benchmarking Workgroup and was pretested at 3 pilot sites prior to dissemination. Prescribers of specialty medications within each institution were identified and sent an email invitation to participate in the study that included a link to the anonymous questionnaire. Respondents were asked to rate their agreement with 10 statements regarding quality of services of integrated and external specialty pharmacies on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). An analysis to determine differences in providers' overall satisfaction with the integrated and external specialty pharmacy practice models, as well as differences in satisfaction scores for each of the 10 statements, was performed using paired-samples t tests. RESULTS: The mean (SD) score for overall satisfaction with integrated specialty pharmacies was significantly higher than the score for satisfaction with external specialty pharmacies: 4.72 (0.58) vs 2.97 (1.20); 95% confidence interval, 1.64-1.87; P < 0.001. Provider ratings of the integrated specialty pharmacy model were also higher for all 10 items evaluating the quality of services (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSION: The study results confirm that the health-system integrated specialty pharmacy practice model, implemented at institutions across the United States, promotes high rates of provider satisfaction with services and perceived benefits.","Anguiano, Rebekah H; Zuckerman, Autumn D; Hall, Elizabeth; Diamantides, Erica; Kumor, Lisa; Duckworth, Deborah L; Peter, Megan; Sorgen, Patrick J; Nathanson, Amy; Kandah, Huda-Marie; Dura, Jillian; Campbell, Udobi",Am. j. health system pharm,579,21

Their detection serves for a better determination of stellar age. The goal of this paper is to identify the dipole modes in an automatic manner without human intervention. I use the power spectra obtained by the Kepler mission for the application of the method. I compute asymptotic dipole mode frequencies as a function of coupling factor and dipole period spacing, and other parameters. For each star, I collapse the power in an echelle diagramme aligned onto the monopole and dipole mixed modes. The power at the null frequency is used as a figure of merit. Using a genetic algorithm, I then optimise the figure of merit by adjusting the location of the dipole frequencies in the power spectrum}. Using published frequencies, I compare the asymptotic dipole mode frequencies with published frequencies. I also used published frequencies for deriving coupling factor and dipole period spacing using a non-linear least squares fit. I use Monte-Carlo simulations of the non-linear least square fit for deriving error bars for each parameters. From the 44 subgiants studied, the automatic identification allows to retrieve within 3 $\mu$Hz at least 80\% of the modes for 32 stars, and within 6 $\mu$Hz at least 90% of the modes for 37 stars. The optimised and fitted gravity-mode period spacing and coupling factor agree with previous measurements. Random errors for the mixed-mode parameters deduced from Monte-Carlo simulation are about 30-50 times smaller than previously determined errors, which are in fact systematic errors. The period spacing and coupling factors of mixed modes in subgiants are confirmed. The current automated procedure will need to be improved using a more accurate asymptotic model and/or proper statistical tests.","Appourchaux, T.",,579,1

Unraveling the COVID-19 pathophysiology remains slow alongside recommendations against autopsies.(1) Eventually COVID 19 placentas with micro-thrombi were identified,(2) as were autopsy confirmed thrombosis of small to mid sized pulmonary vessels with viral inclusion bodies in small bowel intima vasculature.3 The IDSA now supports steroids to counteract the inflammatory storm and reduce mortality.(4, 5) However, recommendations for the management of coagulopathies remain hesitant, citing the lack of descriptive patient characteristics and ineffective reporting of mortality outcomes.(6) METHODS We conducted a retrospective survival analysis on COVID-19 positive mechanically ventilated adults (n=335, 273 male, 62 female) between 3/8/2020 to 5/28/2020. The relative risk of mortality was compared with stratified analyses for hypertension and diabetes. Groups included standard of care (SOC) plus steroids, SOC plus therapeutic lovenox and SOC plus therapeutic lovenox and steroids. The SOC included +/-hydroxychloroquine, +/-azithromycin, +/-additional antibiotics, +/-DVT prophylaxis, sedatives, pressors, IVF and PPIs. RESULTS As of May 28, 2020, 62/335 (19%) mechanically ventilated patients remained alive. The average length of stay for survivors was 31 days. Those receiving SOC plus therapeutic lovenox and steroids demonstrated a survival benefit (33/73, 45%) with a statistically significant reduced relative risk of mortality RR=.5956, 95% CI (.4810-.7374;p&lt;0.0001). Evidence of associations was enhanced in patients receiving SOC plus therapeutic lovenox and steroids with diabetes (n=127) and hypertension (n=140) demonstrating RR= 0.4119, 95% CI (0.2405-0.7057;p=0.0012) and RR=0.5492, 95% CI (0.3955-0.7627;p=0.0003), respectively. The SOC plus lovenox group demonstrated a significant difference in mortality, RR=.7932, 95% CI (.6483-.9704;p=.0244), while the SOC plus steroid group demonstrated no significant difference, RR .9855, 95% CI (.9038-1.0747;p=.7411). CONCLUSION Inflammatory storm and hypercoagulability from COVID 19 can lead to micro thrombosis and organ failure.(7) Our findings suggest that in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 infection therapeutic anticoagulation plus steroids synergistically reduced the risk of mortality and should be treatment of choice. Endothelial damage from diabetes and hypertension may hasten dysfunction in COVID-19 infection, thus therapeutic anticoagulation in less severe cases may demonstrate benefit and warrants investigation.(8).","Johnson, K.; Durrance, R.

The main object of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between the ABO blood group and the occurrence and severity of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search using appropriate MeSH terms was performed through Medline and PubMed. The outcomes considered were the prevalence of the blood group O vs non-O types in SARS-CoV-2 infected and non-infected subjects, and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection according to ABO group. The methodological quality of the studies included in the analysis was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the overall quality of the available evidence using the GRADE system. Benchmarks used to evaluate the effect size were odd ratios (ORs) for case control studies and risk ratios (RRs) for cohort studies. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in the analysis. Overall, individuals with group O had a lower infection rate compared to individuals of non-O group (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.86). However, the difference in the effect size was significantly lower in cohort studies compared to case control studies. No evidence was found indicating an effect of the O type on the disease severity in the infected patients. DISCUSSION: We have found low/very low evidence that group O individuals are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to those in the non-O group. No evidence was found indicating an effect of the O type on disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Franchini, Massimo; Cruciani, Mario; Mengoli, Carlo; Marano, Giuseppe; Candura, Fabio; Lopez, Nadia; Pati, Ilaria; Pupella, Simonetta; De Angelis, Vincenzo","Blood transfus.

ILDs are correlated with the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), which generally also results in pulmonary hypertension (PH). Interferons, secreted in larger amounts during viral infections, are an important possible risk factor contributing to this outcome. Aims: In this narrative review, the role of 10 different viral infections on the generation/development of ILDs and their outcomes are described in detail. The aim of this review is to determine the probable risk that COVID-19 and other viral infections pose in the post-infection development of ILDs, PF, and PH. Methods: Searches in PubMed (Medline), Google Scholar, Web of Science (ISI, Researcher ID, Publons), ResearchGate, Scopus, and secondary sources yielded 134 studies. After exclusion criteria, 92 studies containing the terms ""Coronavirus"" (COVID-19), ""Interstitial Lung Diseases,"" ""Pulmonary Fibrosis,"" ""Pulmonary Hypertension"" and ""viral infections"" were selected for inclusion. Selected articles were read with a focus on the roles of the 10 commonly studied viral infections on generation/intensification of ILDs and classified according to their dominant effect on the respiratory system, with a focus on each infection's effects on parenchyma of the lungs and generation and/or intensification of ILDs. Results: This review found that ILDs, PF, and PH can occur after a COVID-19 viral infection. Similar results are also seen in post-infection cases of other viral infections, including Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, Human herpesvirus-8, adenovirus, Hepatitis C, Torque-Teno (Transfusion-Transmitted) Virus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Conclusion: Results of current studies show probable possibility for generation and/or intensification of ILDs in COVID-19 infected patients like other studied viruses. Studies on determination of the actual prevalence of ILD, PF and PH in post-COVID-19 infected patients, follow-up studies on the prevention of ILDs in recovered COVID-19 patients, and meta-analyzed studies on pulmonary outcomes of pandemic corona viruses are strongly recommended as topics for future studies.","Atabati, Elham; Dehghani-Samani, Amir; Mortazavimoghaddam, Sayyed Gholamreza",Can J Respir Ther,579,25

METHODS: Negative pools were assessed to determine optimal optical density (OD) cutoffs, followed by spiking weak or strong positive samples to assess initial assay performance. Samples were then randomly subjected to pool and individual testing approaches. RESULTS: Single positive specimens consistently converted pools of 5, 10, or 20 into positive outcomes. However, weaker IgG-positive samples failed to similarly convert pools of 50 to a positive result. In contrast, a stronger individual positive sample converted all pools tested into positive outcomes. Finally, examination of 150 samples configured into pools of 5, 10, 20 or 50 accurately predicted the presence of positive or negative specimens within each pool. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that pooling strategies may allow expansion of serological testing capacity. While limitations exist, such strategies may aid in large-scale epidemiological screening or identification of optimal convalescent plasma donors.","Allen, J W L; Verkerke, H; Owens, J; Saeedi, B; Boyer, D; Shin, S; Roback, J D; Neish, A S; Stowell, S R",Transfus. clin. biol,579,5

Identifying particular variants helps to understand and model their spread patterns, design effective mitigation strategies, and prevent future outbreaks. It also plays a crucial role in studying the efficacy of known vaccines against each variant and modeling the likelihood of breakthrough infections. It is well known that the spike protein contains most of the information/variation pertaining to coronavirus variants. In this paper, we use spike sequences to classify different variants of the coronavirus in humans. We show that preserving the order of the amino acids helps the underlying classifiers to achieve better performance. We also show that we can train our model to outperform the baseline algorithms using only a small number of training samples ($1\%$ of the data).

METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection among HCWs working under the Directorate General of Health Services of Muscat Governorate, Ministry of Health, between February and June 2020. Data regarding the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics, risk factors, pre-existing medical conditions, and adherence to IPC measures were collected using a self-administered questionnaire distributed via a web-based mobile application. RESULTS: A total of 126 HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 infection participated in the study. Of these, 72.2% were female, 53.2% worked in primary care facilities, and 61.1% were medical doctors or nurses. Only 18.1% were over 45 years of age and 30.2% had pre-existing medical conditions. While 29.4% had never received IPC training, the majority followed recommended hand hygiene practice (96.8%) and social distancing protocols (93.7%) and wore protective facemasks for routine patient care (96.9%). CONCLUSION: While the majority of HCWs followed crucial IPC measures, one-third had never received specific IPC training or faced restrictions on PPE use. HCWs, including those in housekeeping and administrative functions are recommended to undergo rigorous IPC training. In addition, high-risk HCWs could be assigned duties away from active COVID 19 cases. It is recommended to restructure health facilities for better adherence to IPC standards.","Al Abri, Zahir Ghassan Hilal; Al Zeedi, Manar Al Sanaa Ali; Al Lawati, Anwar Ahmed",J Prim Care Community Health,579,7

The diagnosis of COVID-19 depends on a positive nucleic acid amplification test by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the clinical manifestations and imaging features of COVID-19 are non-specific, and nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 can have false-negative results. It is presently believed that detection of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is an effective screening and diagnostic indicator for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, a combination of nucleic acid and specific antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 will be more effective to diagnose COVID-19, especially to exclude suspected cases.","Zhao, Kaochang; Ai, Li; Zhao, Yang; Wang, Tao; Zheng, Zhishui; Zeng, Shaolin; Ding, Xuhong; Hu, Suping; Nie, Hanxiang",Epidemiol Infect,579,20

However, before addressing Taiwan's inclusion into WHO, we first describe how the era in which WHO was founded, and WHO's resulting constitutional mandate, have focused the Organisation's work on infectious disease eradication. Narrowing in on pandemic management - one aspect of infectious disease eradication - we describe what WHO can offer. These two sections allude to what Taiwan is excluded from. Using Taiwan's COVID-19 experience as a case study, Taiwan's successful management suggests that it is excluded from little, and thus marginally benefits in terms of public health. Yet, there are beneficial political gains in its call for inclusion. Taiwan's recent leveraging and amplification of its COVID-19 success story is thus an extension of its health diplomacy. Extending the call for inclusion online captures a novel digitised health diplomacy effort from Taiwan. The present study computationally analyses press-release and Twitter data to understand how Taiwanese government engages in these channels to frame and respond to the Taiwan/WHO issue. We find that Taiwan brands and propagates a 'Taiwan Model' through hashtags that revolve around coordination and solidarity as opposed to exclusion, indirectly criticising WHO. The piece concludes by discussing the foundational weaknesses in WHO's pandemic management effort in contrast to Taiwan's successful effort despite exclusion. Although Taiwan's inclusion to WHO is improbable due to larger geopolitical factors, inclusion is not a zero-sum game, with potential bi-directional benefits and lessons that can fortify domestic health capacities in preparation for the next pandemic.","Yin, Jason Dean-Chen",Glob Public Health,579,12

METHODS: Osteoblasts were isolated from rabbit bones and treated with 1 μM Methylprednisolone for 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. The Beclin1, MAP1LC3, Atg‐5, Atg‐12, IFT20 and OFD1 mRNAs and proteins were detected by PCR and Western blotting, and their correlation was statistically analyzed. The lengths of osteoblast cilia were measured under a laser confocal microscope, and the autophagy flux was tracked by transfecting the osteoblasts with GFP‐RFP‐LC3 lentivirus. RESULTS: Methylprednisolone significantly upregulated Beclin1, MAP1LC3, Atg‐5, Atg‐12 and OFD1 mRNAs and proteins in a time‐dependent manner, and decreased that of IFT20 (P < 0.05). In addition, the autophagy flux in the osteoblasts also increased and the ciliary length decreased in a time‐dependent manner after Methylprednisolone treatment. The length of the cilia were 5.46 ± 0.11 um at 0 h, 4.08 ± 0.09 um at 12 h, 3.07 ± 0.07 um at 24 h, 2.31 ± 0.10 um at 48 h, and finally 1.15 ± 0.04 um at 72 h. Methylprednisolone treatment also affects primary cilium numbers in cultures, for 0 to 72 h. The autophagy regulatory genes, Beclin1, MAP1LC3, Atg‐5 and Atg‐12, were found to be negatively correlated with IFT20, with an average correlation coefficient of −0.81. A negative correlation was also found between OFD1 and IFT20, with an average correlation coefficient of −0.53. CONCLUSION: Methylprednisolone inhibits primary cilia formation and promotes autophagy, which could be the pathological basis of SANFH. The exact regulatory mechanism needs to be further studied in vivo.","Zhao, Zhen‐qun; Liu, Wan‐lin; Guo, Shi‐bing; Bai, Rui; Yan, Jing‐long",Orthop Surg,579,14

Using a real time analysis of the impressive role played by Community Forest User Groups (CFUGs) in Nepal in responding to the 2015 earthquakes (Earthquake-15) and COVID-19, this paper explores the scopes, capacities, institutional strengths and attributes required for community-based institutions such as CFUGs to become effective in managing and responding natural or other disasters. Our findings suggest that being an autonomous and well-recognized community based institution with trusted social capital (trust, connectedness, norms and network) for collective action together with its scope and mandate to democratically manage and mobilize its physical, financial, natural and human assets, CFUGs have become the most effective institution to provide immediate support to disaster affected communities. While most of other agencies including non-governmental organizations spend a lot of time exploring avenues for immediate response to the disasters, CFUGs have immediate access and infrastructure to support millions of people in rural areas. We argue that this contribution needs to be recognized, and CFUGs can provide a valuable institutional framework for the preparedness, response and recovery from disasters and to build resilience in the future.","Gentle, Popular; Maraseni, Tek N.; Paudel, Dinesh; Dahal, Ganga R.; Kanel, Tara; Pathak, Bharati",,579,1

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed not only an increased risk for infection, morbidity, and mortality among those with chronic conditions but long-standing health inequities by age, race, sex, and other social determinants. Obesity plus depression represent one such prevalent comorbidity for which few effective integrated interventions exist, prompting concern about the potential for secondary physical and mental health pandemics post COVID-19. Translational behavioral medicine research can play an important role in studying integrated collaborative healthcare approaches and advancing scientific understanding on how to engage and more effectively treat diverse populations with physical and mental health comorbidities. The RAINBOW (Research Aimed at Improving Both Mood and Weight) clinical trial experience offers a wealth of insights into the potential of collaborative care interventions to advance behavior therapy research and practice. Primary care patients with co-occurring obesity and depression were assigned to either Integrated Coaching for Mood and Weight (I-CARE), which blended Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) for weight management and the Program to Encourage Active Rewarding Lives (PEARLS) for depression, or usual care, to examine clinical, cost-effectiveness, and implementation outcomes. This commentary highlights the empirical findings of eight RAINBOW research papers and discusses implications for future studies, including their relevance in the U.S. COVID-19 context. Organized by key principles of translational behavioral medicine research, the commentary aims to examine and embrace the heterogeneity of baseline and intervention response differences among those living with multiple chronic conditions. We conclude that to prevent health and healthcare disparities from widening further, tailored engagement, dissemination, and implementation strategies and flexible delivery formats are essential to improve treatment access and outcomes among underrepresented populations.","Venditti, Elizabeth M; Steinman, Lesley E; Lewis, Megan A; Weiner, Bryan J; Ma, Jun",Transl Behav Med,579,26

This study evaluated the potential role of influenza vaccine in reducing the rate of hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 cases recorded in the province of Brindisi (Apulia, Southern Italy) during the first pandemic wave (February–May 2020) and occurring in patients vaccinated with the influenza vaccine during the 2019–2020 influenza season were considered. From February 2020 to May 2020, 3872 inhabitants of the province of Brindisi underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and 664 (8.7%) tested positive. A multivariate analysis showed that among COVID-19 patients neither hospitalization nor death was significantly associated with influenza vaccination (p > 0.05), whereas within this group male sex, older age, and chronic diseases were identified as risk factors for morbidity and mortality. Our study did not show an association between the influenza vaccine and complications of COVID-19.

A parallel growth in aesthetic surgery demand has been documented. OBJECTIVES: To identify associations between video call engagement and aesthetic surgery attitudes. METHODS: We distributed a cross-sectional survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk in November 2020. Respondents were asked to report their time spent video calling, video calling applications and features (eg, virtual backgrounds) they used, and aesthetic surgery attitudes using the 15-item Acceptance of Cosmetic Surgery Scale (ACSS; higher scores indicate greater acceptance). We compared ACSS scores between video call users and non-users using Student’s t-tests. We used Pearson’s correlation coefficient to quantify associations between ACSS scores and time spent on calls and multivariable analysis to estimate associations between video call engagement and ACSS scores. RESULTS: A total of 295 respondents (mean age, 37.6; 49.5% female) completed the survey. Across all video call applications surveyed, video call users had higher ACSS scores than non-users. Increased time respondents spent looking at their own face on video call was moderately associated with higher ACSS scores (r=0.48, P<0.01), while time spent looking at another person’s face was not associated with a change in ACSS scores (r=0.09, P=0.11). Increased video call use was associated with higher ACSS scores. CONCLUSIONS: Increased video calling use is associated with increased acceptance of aesthetic surgery. Although the clinical significance of ACSS scores can be better elucidated, plastic surgeons should consider the effects of video calling on patient motivations for aesthetic surgery in the COVID-19 era.","Chen, Jonlin; Chow, Amanda; Fadavi, Darya; Long, Chao; Sun, Alexander H; Cooney, Carisa M; Broderick, Kristen P",Aesthet Surg J,579,20

IBV nucleotide sequence alignment shows that overall the sequences are highly conserved, with homologies from 91.1 to 96.5%. However, there are also two regions (730 to 800 and 1138 to 1166) that appear to be even more highly conserved. Overall, the nucleocapsid protein is highly variable both in size and composition between coronavirus major antigenic groups but is conserved within these groups. A phylogenetic tree of the nucleocapsid protein of various coronaviruses indicates that the coronaviruses fall into distinct groups that correspond to the three major antigenic groups; however, a phylogenetic tree of the IBV nucleocapsid shows that this does not hold true for the type specific antigenic groups of IBV.","Williams, Anna K.; Li, Wang; Sneed, Loyd W.; Collisson, Ellen W.",Virus Research,579,16

METHODS A total of 729 2D axial plan slices with 246 severe cases and 483 non-severe cases were employed in this study. By taking the advantages of the pre-trained deep neural network, four pre-trained off-the-shelf deep models (Inception-V3, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, DenseNet-201) were exploited to extract the features from these CT scans. These features are then fed to multiple classifiers (linear discriminant, linear SVM, cubic SVM, KNN and Adaboost decision tree) to identify the severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases. Three validation strategies (holdout validation, tenfold cross-validation and leave-one-out) are employed to validate the feasibility of proposed pipelines.

In the face of significant uncertainty around the epidemic impact of in-person schooling, policymakers, parents, and teachers are weighing the risks and benefits of returning to in-person education. In this context, we examined the impact of different school reopening scenarios on transmission within and outside of schools and on the share of school days that would need to be spent learning at a distance. Methods: We used an agent-based mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission and interventions to quantify the impact of school reopening on disease transmission and the extent to which school-based interventions could mitigate epidemic spread within and outside schools. We compared seven school reopening strategies that vary the degree of countermeasures within schools to mitigate COVID-19 transmission, including the use of face masks, physical distancing, classroom cohorting, screening, testing, and contact tracing, as well as schedule changes to reduce the number of students in school. We considered three scenarios for the size of the epidemic in the two weeks prior to school reopening: 20, 50, or 110 detected cases per 100,000 individuals and assumed the epidemic was slowly declining with full school closures. For each scenario, we calculated the percentage of schools that would have at least one person arriving at school with an active COVID-19 infection on the first day of school; the percentage of in-person school days that would be lost due to scheduled distance learning, symptomatic screening or quarantine; the cumulative infection rate for students, staff and teachers over the first three months of school; and the effective reproduction number averaged over the first three months of school within the community. Findings: In-person schooling poses significant risks to students, teachers, and staff. On the first day of school, 5-42% of schools would have at least one person arrive at school with active COVID-19, depending on the incidence of COVID in the community and the school type. However, reducing class sizes via A/B school scheduling, combined with an incremental approach that returns elementary schools in person and keeps all other students remote, can mitigate COVID transmission. In the absence of any countermeasures in schools, we expect 6-25% of teaching and non-teaching staff and 4-20% of students to be infected with COVID in the first three months of school, depending upon the case detection rate. Schools can lower this risk to as low as 0.2% for staff and 0.1% for students by returning elementary schools with a hybrid schedule while all other grades continue learning remotely. However, this approach would require 60-85% of all school days to be spent at home. Despite the significant risks to the school population, reopening schools would not significantly increase community-wide transmission, provided sufficient countermeasures are implemented in schools. Interpretation: Without extensive countermeasures, school reopening may lead to an increase in infections and a significant number of re-closures as cases are identified among staff and students. Returning elementary schools only with A/B scheduling is the lowest risk school reopening strategy that includes some in-person learning.","Cohen, J. A.; Mistry, D.; Kerr, C. C.; Klein, D.

Among the Desiderata was a call for terminologies to be “concept oriented.” Since then, research has trended toward the extension of terminologies into ontologies. A paper by Smith, entitled “From Concepts to Clinical Reality: An Essay on the Benchmarking of Biomedical Terminologies” urges a realist approach that seeks terminologies composed of universals, rather than concepts. The current paper addresses issues raised by Smith and attempts to extend the Desiderata, not away from concepts, but towards recognition that concepts and universals must both be embraced and can coexist peaceably in controlled terminologies. To that end, additional Desiderata are defined that deal with the purpose, rather than the structure, of controlled medical terminologies.","Cimino, James J.",J Biomed Inform,579,24

Methods In this retrospective cohort study, patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Changsha, China were included. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome were retrieved. Univariable and multivariable analysis were performed to explore potential factors. Results Totally 147 patients with COVID-19 were included. The median duration of viral shedding (the number of days from symptoms onset till the successive negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA) was 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 12 to 21). Multivariable Logistic regression analysis indicated that the highest temperature at admission (odds ratio [OR], 5.200; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.190-22.726; p = 0.028) and time from symptom onset to admission (OR, 1.740; 95% CI: 1.296-2.337; p < 0.001) and hospital length of stay (OR, 1.604; 95% CI: 1.262-2.040; p < 0.001) were risk factors for prolonged duration of viral shedding. Conclusions This is the study with relatively large sample size that mainly focused on the duration of viral shedding and relevant factors in patients with COVID-19 outside of Wuhan, China. Potential risk factors were identified and should be taken into consideration for the strategy of quarantine of infected patients.","Qi, Lin; Yang, Yong; Jiang, Dixuan; Tu, Chao; Wan, Lu; Chen, Xiangyu; Li, Zhihong",Int J Infect Dis,579,10

OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to describe and analyze the impact of 2 major crises (the severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] outbreak, and the electrical system failure [“blackout”]) on pharmacy practice and pharmacists in Toronto, Canada. METHODS: An exploratory, qualitative study was undertaken. Pharmacists were recruited, provided informed consent, and were interviewed. Data from transcripts were coded and categorized to identify themes related to adaptive strategies undertaken by pharmacists during times of civil crisis. RESULTS: Five key themes emerged from this research: (1) during times of crisis, pharmacies become frontline health care facilities, (2) a vacuity of leadership/lack of utility of emergency preparedness guidelines and policies, (3) role of and reliance on experience and professional judgment, (4) importance of documentation, and (5) the importance of “teamness” in enabling successful adaptation during times of crisis. CONCLUSIONS: Emergencies and civil crises will continue to occur. Findings of this study include the importance of effective documentation systems and teamwork practices, as well as confident reliance on professional judgment and experience, as determinants of successful adaptation to civil crises.","Austin, Zubin; Martin, J.

While it primarily affects the respiratory system, we now have evidence that it affects multiple organ systems in the human body. Cardiac manifestations may include myocarditis, life threatening arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, systolic heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. Myocarditis is increasingly recognized as a complication of Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) and may result from direct viral injury or from exaggerated host immune response. The diagnosis is established similar to other etiologies, and is based on detailed history, clinical exam, laboratory findings and non-invasive imaging studies. When available, cardiac MRI is the preferred imaging modality. Endomyocardial biopsy may be performed if the diagnosis remains uncertain. Current management is mainly supportive with the potential addition of interventions recommended for severe COVID-19 disease, such as remdesivir, steroids, and convalescent plasma. In the setting of cardiogenic shock and refractory, life-threatening arrhythmias that persist despite medical therapy, advanced mechanical circulatory support devices should be considered. Ultimately, early recognition and aggressive intervention are key factors in reducing morbidity and mortality. Our management strategy is expected to evolve further as we learn more about COVID-19 disease and the associated cardiac complications.","Agdamag, Arianne Clare C.; Edmiston, Jonathan B.; Charpentier, Victoria; Chowdhury, Mohammed; Fraser, Meg; Maharaj, Valmiki R.; Francis, Gary S.; Alexy, Tamas",Medicina (Kaunas),579,14

Why these viruses can cause profound pathologies in humans, while natural reservoir hosts often show little evidence of disease is not completely understood. Differences in the host immune response, especially within the innate compartment, have been suggested to be involved in this divergence. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that play a critical role in the early antiviral response, secreting effector cytokines and clearing infected cells. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms through which NK cells interact with viruses, their contribution towards maintaining equilibrium between the virus and its natural host, and their role in disease progression in humans and other non-natural hosts.","Diaz-Salazar, Carlos; Sun, Joseph C",Curr Opin Virol,579,1

Recognition of prognostic factors is essential because of its growing prevalence and high clinical costs. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the global prevalence of obesity in COVID-19 patients and to investigate whether obesity is a risk factor for the COVID-19, COVID-19 severity, and its poor clinical outcomes including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality. METHODS: The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020203386). A systematic search of Scopus, Medline, and Web of Sciences was conducted from 31 December 2019 to 1 June 2020 to find pertinent studies. After selection, 54 studies from 10 different countries were included in the quantitative analyses. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the associations. RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity was 33% (95% CI 30.0%–35.0%) among patients with COVID-19. Obesity was significantly associated with susceptibility to COVID-19 (OR = 2.42, 95% CI 1.58–3.70; moderate certainty) and COVID-19 severity (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.48–1.76; low certainty). Furthermore, obesity was a significant risk factor for hospitalization (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.47–2.09; very low certainty), mechanical ventilation (OR = 2.24, 95% CI 1.70–2.94; low certainty), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.38–2.22; low certainty), and death (OR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.06–1.41; low certainty) in COVID-19 patients. In the subgroup analyses, these associations were supported by the majority of subgroups.

Several novel methods for preparing vaccine candidates are currently undergoing clinical evaluation in response to the urgent need to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In many cases, these methods rely on new approaches for vaccine production and immune stimulation. We report on the use of a novel method (SolaVAX™) for production of an inactivated vaccine candidate and the testing of that candidate in a hamster animal model for its ability to prevent infection upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus. The studies employed in this work included an evaluation of the levels of neutralizing antibody produced post-vaccination, levels of specific antibody sub-types to RBD and spike protein that were generated, evaluation of viral shedding post-challenge, flow cytometric and single cell sequencing data on cellular fractions and histopathological evaluation of tissues post-challenge. The results from this study provide insight into the immunological responses occurring as a result of vaccination with the proposed vaccine candidate and the impact that adjuvant formulations, specifically developed to promote Th1 type immune responses, have on vaccine efficacy and protection against infection following challenge with live SARS-CoV-2. This data may have utility in the development of effective vaccine candidates broadly. Furthermore, the results suggest that preparation of a whole virion vaccine for COVID-19 using this specific photochemical method may have utility in the preparation of one such vaccine candidate.

The serological antibody response induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have already been well characterized. In order to understand the mucosal immune response profiles of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, we examined both the mucosal and systemic responses of subjects vaccinated by two different vaccination platforms: mRNA (Comirnaty) and inactivated virus (CoronaVac). Serial nasal epithelial lining fluid (NELF) and peripheral blood samples were collected in ten subjects who had received CoronaVac and thirty-two subjects who had received Comirnaty. We quantified IgA and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein by ELISA in NELF and plasma samples. The neutralization effect of these two sample types were evaluated by surrogate ACE-SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein ELISA. Only Comirnaty induced nasal SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein-specific (S1-specific) IgA and IgG responses, which were evident as early as on 14 days after the first dose. The NELF samples of 72% of subjects became IgA+IgG+, while in 62.5% of subjects the samples were neutralizing by 7 days after the second dose. In 45% of the subjects their NELF remained neutralizing 50 days after the booster of Comirnaty. In plasma, 91% and 100% Comirnaty subjects possessed S1-specific IgA+IgG+ on 14 days after the first dose and 7 days after booster, respectively. The plasma collected on 7 days after booster was 100% neutralizing. The induction of S1-specific antibody by CoronaVac was IgG dominant, and 70% of the subjects possessed S1-specific IgG by 7 days after booster and were all neutralizing. This study reveals that Comirnaty is able to induce S1-specific IgA and IgG response with neutralizing activity in the nasal mucosa in addition to a consistent systemic response. The clinical implications and the biological mechanism of an additional nasal immune response induced by vaccines such as Comirnaty warrant further investigation.","Chan, R. W.; Liu, S.; Cheung, J.

Analyses of spatial locations, chemical properties, and structural and energetic impacts of the observed amino acid changes in >48,000 viral proteome sequences showed how each one of the 29 viral study proteins have undergone amino acid changes. Structural models computed for every unique sequence variant revealed that most substitutions map to protein surfaces and boundary layers with a minority affecting hydrophobic cores. Conservative changes were observed more frequently in cores versus boundary layers/surfaces. Active sites and protein-protein interfaces showed modest numbers of substitutions. Energetics calculations showed that the impact of substitutions on the thermodynamic stability of the proteome follows a universal bi-Gaussian distribution. Detailed results are presented for six drug discovery targets and four structural proteins comprising the virion, highlighting substitutions with the potential to impact protein structure, enzyme activity, and functional interfaces. Characterizing the evolution of the virus in three dimensions provides testable insights into viral protein function and should aid in structure-based drug discovery efforts as well as the prospective identification of amino acid substitutions with potential for drug resistance.","Lubin, Joseph H.; Zardecki, Christine; Dolan, Elliott M.; Lu, Changpeng; Shen, Zhuofan; Dutta, Shuchismita; Westbrook, John D.; Hudson, Brian P.; Goodsell, David S.; Williams, Jonathan K.; Voigt, Maria; Sarma, Vidur; Xie, Lingjun; Venkatachalam, Thejasvi; Arnold, Steven; Alvarado, Luz Helena Alfaro; Catalfano, Kevin; Khan, Aaliyah; McCarthy, Erika; Staggers, Sophia; Tinsley, Brea; Trudeau, Alan; Singh, Jitendra; Whitmore, Lindsey; Zheng, Helen; Benedek, Matthew; Currier, Jenna; Dresel, Mark; Duvvuru, Ashish; Dyszel, Britney; Fingar, Emily; Hennen, Elizabeth M.; Kirsch, Michael; Khan, Ali A.; Labrie-Cleary, Charlotte; Laporte, Stephanie; Lenkeit, Evan; Martin, Kailey; Orellana, Marilyn; de la Campa, Melanie Ortiz-Alvarez; Paredes, Isaac; Wheeler, Baleigh; Rupert, Allison; Sam, Andrew; See, Katherine; Zapata, Santiago Soto; Craig, Paul A.; Hall, Bonnie L.; Jiang, Jennifer; Koeppe, Julia R.; Mills, Stephen A.; Pikaart, Michael J.; Roberts, Rebecca; Bromberg, Yana; Hoyer, J.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study, from 16(th) March, 2020 to 30(th) April, 2020; final follow-up on 10(th) May, 2020. 265 patients consecutively admitted to the non-ICU wards with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were screened for inclusion. 205 patients who developed AHRF (SpO(2)/FiO(2) ≤ 440 or PaO(2)/FiO(2) ≤ 300) were only included in the final study. Direct admission to the Intensive care unit (ICU), patients developing composite primary outcome within 24 hours of admission, and patients who never became hypoxic during their stay in the hospital were excluded. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on corticosteroid. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU transfer, intubation, or in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were ICU transfer, intubation, in-hospital mortality, discharge, length of stay, and daily trend of SpO(2)/FiO(2) (SF) ratio from the index date. Cox-proportional hazard regression was implemented to analyze the time to event outcomes. RESULT: Among 205 patients, 60 (29.27%) were treated with corticosteroid. The mean age was ~57 years, and ~75% were men. Thirteen patients (22.41%) developed a primary composite outcome in the corticosteroid cohort vs. 54 (37.5%) patients in the non-corticosteroid cohort (P = 0.039). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the development of the composite primary outcome was 0.15 (95% CI, 0.07–0.33; P <0.001). The adjusted hazard ratio for ICU transfer was 0.16 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.34; P < 0.001), intubation was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.70; P– 0.005), death was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.22 to 1.31; P– 0.172), composite of death or intubation was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.66; P– 0.002) and discharge was 3.65 (95% CI, 2.20 to 6.06; P<0.001). The corticosteroid cohort had increasing SpO(2)/FiO(2) over time compared to the non-corticosteroid cohort who experience decreasing SpO(2)/FiO(2) over time. CONCLUSION: Among non-ICU patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by AHRF, treatment with corticosteroid was associated with a significantly lower risk of the primary composite outcome of ICU transfer, intubation, or in-hospital death, composite of intubation or death and individual components of the primary outcome.","Majmundar, Monil; Kansara, Tikal; Lenik, Joanna Marta; Park, Hansang; Ghosh, Kuldeep; Doshi, Rajkumar; Shah, Palak; Kumar, Ashish; Amin, Hossam; Chaudhari, Shobhana; Habtes, Imnett",PLoS One,579,20

This rate ranges between about 13 percent in Portugal and Spain, and more than 22 percent in Luxembourg, Belgium, and Denmark. It declines in older age groups and, on average, is lower in men than in women in all countries studied, and lower among the poorly educated compared to those with higher levels of education. However, large variance was observed in the average share of informal caregivers for most countries between the three surveys.

The spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a key role in binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2. S proteins that are expressed on the cell membrane can initiate receptor-dependent syncytia formation that is associated with extensive tissue damage. Formation of syncytia have been previously observed in cells infected with various other viruses (e.g., HIV, Ebola, Influenza, and Herpesviruses). However, this phenomenon is not well documented and the mechanisms regulating the formation of these syncytia by SARS-CoV-2 are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the possibility that cell fusion events mediated by the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 interaction can occur in different human cell lines that mimic different tissue origins. These cell lines were stably transduced with either wild-type (WT-S) S protein or a mutated variant where the ER-retention motif was removed (Δ19-S), or human ACE2 vectors. Different co-culture combinations of spike-expressing 293T, A549, K562, and SK-Hep1 cells with hACE2-expressing cells revealed cell hybrid fusion. However, only certain cells expressing S protein can form syncytial structures as this phenomenon cannot be observed in all co-culture combinations. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 mediated cell-cell fusion represents a cell type-dependent process which might rely on a different set of parameters. Recently, the Δ19-S variant is being widely used to increase SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production for in vitro assays. Comparison of cell fusion occurring via Δ19-S expressing cells shows defective nuclear fusion and syncytia formation compared to WT-S. This distinction between the Δ19-S variant and WT-S protein may have downstream implications for studies that utilize pseudovirus-based entry assays. Additionally, this study suggest that spike protein expressed by vaccines may affect different ACE2-expressing host cells after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration. The long-term effects of these vaccines should be monitored carefully.","Chen, Chih-Hsiung; Badeti, Saiaditya; Cho, Jong Hyun; Naghizadeh, Alireza; Wang, Xuening; Liu, Dongfang",Res Sq,579,20

This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and liver injury in Japanese patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study. All consecutive patients with COVID-19 who visited or were admitted to our hospital before May 12, 2020, were enrolled. Their demographics, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, concomitant drugs, treatment, and clinical course were reviewed. We defined liver injury as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels over the upper limit of normal. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with COVID-19 (median age, 47 years old; men/women, 13/9) were enrolled. Two patients had underlying liver diseases, and two were diagnosed as having COVID-19 without any symptoms. Elevated ALT and GGT levels were found in 12 and 12 patients, respectively, and liver injury was observed in 15 patients (68.2%). Compared with the patients without liver injury, those with liver injury had a significantly higher fever during the clinical course (median, 37.5℃ vs. 38.8℃, p=0.006). A significant correlation was found between the highest serum liver values and the highest body temperature in each patient. Among the 22 patients, 4 required artificial respiratory support, and 2 died thereafter. Liver injury was not associated with the severity or mortality of COVID-19.

These are: firstly, in diagnosis, to recognise the causative agent of an illness; secondly, for molecular typing for (i) patient management, (ii) epidemiological reasons (e.g. investigating routes of transmission), (iii) purposes related to vaccine use; and thirdly, in research, to investigate the interactions between the virus and the host cell. Microarrays intended for syndromic diagnostic purposes require genome specific probes to capture the unknown target viral sequences and thereby reveal the presence of that virus in a test sample. Microarrays intended for typing and patient management, e.g. monitoring antiviral drug resistant mutations require a set of probes representing the important sequence variants of one or more viral genes. Microarrays intended for research into virus–host interactions require probes representative of each individual gene or mRNA of either the virus or the host genome. Diagnostic microarrays are dependent for their utility and versatility on generic, multiplex or random polymerase chain reactions that will amplify any of several (unknown) viral target sequences from a patient sample.

This review examines the evidence for these sex and gender differences and aims to illustrate possible mechanisms behind such sensitivity. Successful entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the body is dependent on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Thus, sex-based differences in the expression of the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 may explain the disparities in COVID-19 severity and fatality. Furthermore, these disparities may also be attributed to sex-based difference in immunological responses. Finally, the differences in clinical outcomes of COVID-19 infections between men and women may be due to gendered differences in behaviors, such as smoking, and prevalence to comorbidities. An understanding of the sex and gender sensitivities of COVID-19 infection is a necessary component towards the creation of effective treatment options and therapies for the virus.

Methods: The human capital approach (HCA) model was used to estimate the TDVHL of the 30,916 human lives lost due to COVID-19 in France; i.e., assuming a discount rate of 3% and the national average life expectancy at birth of 83.13 years. To test the robustness of the estimated TDVHL, the model was rerun (a) using 5% and 10% discount rates, while holding the French average life expectancy constant; and (b) consecutively substituting national life expectancy with the world average life expectancy of 73.2 years and the world highest life expectancy of 88.17 years. Results: The human lives lost had a TDVHL of Int$10,492,290,194, and an average value of Int$339,381 per human life lost. Rerun of the HCA model with 5% and 10% discount rates decreased TDVHL by Int$1,304,764,602 (12.4%) and Int$3,506,938,312 (33%), respectively. Re-calculation of the model with the world average life expectancy decreased the TDVHL by Int$7,750,187,267 (73.87%).

Methods: We enrolled two critically ill patients with comorbidities diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detected by RT-PCR during hospitalization. Clinical characteristics, longitudinal immunological, and biochemical parameters of each critical COVID-19 case were collected. Main Results: The clinical characteristics and laboratory results of each case demonstrated critical symptoms of COVID-19 with poor outcomes. Both nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Two patients received targeted treatments against pathogen infection and inflammation in addition to interventional therapies, except for Patient 2, who received an additional artificial liver system treatment. Hyperinflammation with a dominantly high level of IL-6 was observed in BALF samples from both critical cases with decreased T cell populations. High levels of cytokines and pathological parameters were successively maintained in Patient 1, but rapidly reduced at the late treatment stage in Patient 2. The outcome of Patient 1 is death, whereas the outcome of Patient 2 is recovery.

This review has also the objective to assess the use of telemedicine for diabetes care across three different areas: education, social media, and daily care. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances in diabetes technology after integration of CSII with CGM have increased the popularity of this treatment modality in pediatric age and shifted the standard diabetes management in many countries. We found an impressive transition from the use of CSII and/or CGM only to integrative devices with automated delivery systems. Although much has changed over the past 5 years, including a pandemic period that precipitated a broader use of telemedicine in diabetes care, some advances in technology may still be an additional burden of care for providers, patients, and caregivers. The extent of a higher rate of “auto-mode” use in diabetes devices while using the HCL/DIYAPS is essential to reduce the burden of diabetes treatment. SUMMARY: More studies including higher-risk populations are needed, and efforts should be taken to ensure proper access to cost-effective advanced technology on diabetes care.

In the past month we recorded an outbreak of Kawasaki disease; we aimed to evaluate incidence and features of patients with Kawasaki-like disease diagnosed during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with a Kawasaki-like disease at our centre in the past 5 years were divided according to symptomatic presentation before (group 1) or after (group 2) the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Kawasaki- like presentations were managed as Kawasaki disease according to the American Heart Association indications. Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (KDSS) was defined by presence of circulatory dysfunction, and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) by the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation criteria. Current or previous infection was sought by reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, and by serological qualitative test detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively. FINDINGS: Group 1 comprised 19 patients (seven boys, 12 girls; aged 3·0 years [SD 2·5]) diagnosed between Jan 1, 2015, and Feb 17, 2020. Group 2 included ten patients (seven boys, three girls; aged 7·5 years [SD 3·5]) diagnosed between Feb 18 and April 20, 2020; eight of ten were positive for IgG or IgM, or both. The two groups differed in disease incidence (group 1 vs group 2, 0·3 vs ten per month), mean age (3·0 vs 7·5 years), cardiac involvement (two of 19 vs six of ten), KDSS (zero of 19 vs five of ten), MAS (zero of 19 vs five of ten), and need for adjunctive steroid treatment (three of 19 vs eight of ten; all p<0·01). INTERPRETATION: In the past month we found a 30-fold increased incidence of Kawasaki-like disease. Children diagnosed after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic began showed evidence of immune response to the virus, were older, had a higher rate of cardiac involvement, and features of MAS. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was associated with high incidence of a severe form of Kawasaki disease. A similar outbreak of Kawasaki-like disease is expected in countries involved in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.

In 2016 there were over 1 million deaths in >70 year olds due to lower respiratory tract infections; 13–31% of these have been reported to be caused by viruses. Since then, there has been a global COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused over 2.3 million deaths so far; increased age has been shown to be the biggest risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Thus, the burden of respiratory viral infections in the elderly is becoming an increasing unmet clinical need. Particular challenges are faced due to the interplay of a variety of factors including complex multimorbidities, decreased physiological reserve and an aging immune system. Moreover, their atypical presentation of symptoms may lead to delayed necessary care, prescription of additional drugs and prolonged hospital stay. This leads to morbidity and mortality and further nosocomial spread. Clinicians currently have limited access to sensitive detection methods. Furthermore, a lack of effective antiviral treatments means there is little incentive to diagnose and record specific non-COVID-19 viral infections. To meet this unmet clinical need, it is first essential to fully understand the burden of respiratory viruses in the elderly. Doing this through prospective screening research studies for all respiratory viruses will help guide preventative policies and clinical trials for emerging therapeutics. The implementation of multiplex point-of-care diagnostics as a mainstay in all healthcare settings will be essential to understand the burden of respiratory viruses, diagnose patients and monitor outbreaks. The further development of novel targeted vaccinations as well as anti-viral therapeutics and new ways to augment the aging immune system is now also essential.

Aim: Provide an opportunity for COVID-infected people experiencing homelessness to isolate and receive care until no longer contagious Setting: A decommissioned hospital building. Participants: COVID-infected people experiencing homelessness Program Description: Care was provided by physician volunteers and furloughed staff. Care focused on allowing isolation, managing COVID-19 symptoms, harm-reduction interventions, and addressing problems related to substance use and mental illness. Program evaluation: Among 226 patients who received care, 65% were referred from BMC. Five percent were transferred to the hospital for a complication that appeared COVID-related. There were no deaths, but 7 patients had non-fatal overdoses. Seventy-nine % had at least one diagnosis of mental illness, and 42% reported actively using at least one substance at the time of admission. Thirty % had at least one mental health diagnosis plus active substance use. Discussion: This hospital-based COVID Recuperation Unit was rapidly deployed, provided safe isolation for 226 patients over 8 weeks, treated frequent SUD and mental illness, and helped prevent the hospital’s acute-care bed capacity from being overwhelmed during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Komaromy, Miriam; Harris,; Koenig, MBA Rob M.; Tomanovich, MA Mary; Ruiz-Mercado, Glorimar; Barocas, Joshua A.",Res Sq,579,21

Consequently, increasing the throughput for clinical laboratories for the purposes of conducting large-scale diagnostic testing is urgently needed. Here we support the hypothesis that standard diagnostic protocol for SARS-CoV-2 virus could be conveniently applied to pooled samples obtained from different subjects. We suggest that a two-step sequential pooling procedure could identify positive subjects, ensuring at the same time significant benefits of cost and time. The simulation data presented herein were used to assess the efficiency, in terms of number of required tests, both for random assignment of the subjects to the pools and for situations in which epidemiological and clinical data are used to create ""informed"" pools.

PubMed database and Cochrane Library database were searched by computer to seek the epidemiological data of COVID-19 cases and literatures regarding CVDs from 1 Jan to 6 October 2020. Two researchers independently conducted literature screening, data collection and the assessment of the risk of bias of the studies included. RevMan 5.2 software was employed for meta-analysis. Funnel plot was adopted to assess the publication bias. On the whole, 21 studies comprising 7041 COVID-19 cases were included. As revealed from the meta-analysis, 14.0% (984/7027) of cases had a history of smoking, and 9.7% (675/6931) were subject to underlying CVDs. Cases with a history of smoking achieved a higher rate of COVID-19 disease progression as opposed to those having not smoked (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.29–1.81, P < 0.00001), while no significant association could be found between smoking status and COVID-19 disease progression (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.93–1.63, P = 0.15). Besides, smoking history elevated the mortality rate by 1.91-fold (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.35–2.69, P = 0.0002). Moreover, underlying CVD elevated the incidence of severe disease by 2.87-fold (OR 2.87, 95% CI 2.29–3.61, P < 0.00001) and mortality by 3.05-fold (OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.82–5.11, P < 0.0001) in COVID-19 cases. As demonstrated from the current evidence, smoking displays a strong association with COVID-19 disease progression and mortality, and intensive tobacco control is imperative. Moreover, cases with CVD show a significantly elevated risk of disease progression and death when subject to COVID-19. However, the association between COVID-19 and CVD, and the potential effect exerted by smoking in the development of the two still require further verifications by larger and higher quality studies.","Kang, Shiwei; Gong, Xiaowei; Yuan, Yadong",Epidemiol Infect,579,9

We aimed to determine parameters predicting which COVID-19 patients are at risk of DVT and to assess the benefit of prophylactic anti-coagulation.Adult hospitalized patients with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) undergoing venous duplex ultrasound for DVT assessment (nâ=â451) were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical and laboratory data within 72âhours of ultrasound were collected. Using split sampling and a 10-fold cross-validation, a random forest model was developed to find the most important variables for predicting DVT. Different d-dimer cutoffs were examined for classification of DVT. We also compared the rate of DVT between the patients going and not going under thromboprophylaxis.DVT was found in 65 (14%) of 451 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction positive patients. The random forest model, trained and cross-validated on 2/3 of the original sample (nâ=â301), had area under the receiver operating characteristic curveâ=â0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.97) for prediction of DVT in the test set (nâ=â150), with sensitivityâ=â93% (95%CI: 68%-99%) and specificityâ=â82% (95%CI: 75%-88%). The following variables had the highest importance: d-dimer, thromboprophylaxis, systolic blood pressure, admission to ultrasound interval, and platelets. Thromboprophylaxis reduced DVT risk 4-fold from 26% to 6% (Pâ<â.001), while anti-coagulation therapy led to hemorrhagic complications in 14 (22%) of 65 patients with DVT including 2 fatal intra-cranial hemorrhages. D-dimer was the most important predictor with area under curveâ=â0.79 (95%CI: 0.73-0.86) by itself, and a 5000âng/mL threshold at 7âdays postCOVID-19 symptom onset had 75% (95%CI: 53%-90%) sensitivity and 81% (95%CI: 72%-88%) specificity. In comparison with d-dimer alone, the random forest model showed 68% versus 32% specificity at 95% sensitivity, and 44% versus 23% sensitivity at 95% specificity.D-dimer >5000âng/mL predicts DVT with high accuracy suggesting regular monitoring with d-dimer in the early stages of COVID-19 may be useful. A random forest model improved the prediction of DVT. Thromboprophylaxis reduced DVT in COVID-19 patients and should be considered in all patients. Full anti-coagulation therapy has a risk of life-threatening hemorrhage.","Riyahi, Sadjad; Hectors, Stefanie J; Prince, Martin R; Sweeney, Elizabeth M; Lane, Elizabeth G; Honya, Ricky; Margolis, Daniel J",Medicine (Baltimore),579,1

With the rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, systematically decoding the intercellular communication network involving L–R interactions has become a focus of research. Therefore, construction of a comprehensive, high-confidence and well-organized resource to retrieve L–R interactions in order to study the functional effects of cell–cell communications would be of great value. RESULTS: In this study, we developed Cellinker, a platform of literature-supported L–R interactions that play roles in cell–cell communication. We aimed to provide a useful platform for studies on cell–cell communication mediated by L–R interactions. The current version of Cellinker documents over 3700 human and 3200 mouse L–R protein–protein interactions (PPIs) and embeds a practical and convenient webserver with which researchers can decode intercellular communications based on scRNA-seq data. And over 400 endogenous small molecule (sMOL) related L–R interactions were collected as well. Moreover, to help with research on coronavirus (CoV) infection, Cellinker collects information on 16L–R PPIs involved in CoV–human interactions (including 12L–R PPIs involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection). In summary, Cellinker provides a user-friendly interface for querying, browsing and visualizing L–R interactions as well as a practical and convenient web tool for inferring intercellular communications based on scRNA-seq data. We believe this platform could promote intercellular communication research and accelerate the development of related algorithms for scRNA-seq studies.

Given reports of similar transmission mechanisms for COVID-19 and seasonal coronaviruses, we investigated whether hand hygiene impacted the risk of acquiring seasonal coronavirus infections. Methods: Data were drawn from three successive winter cohorts (2006-2009) of the England-wide Flu Watch study. Participants ( n=1633) provided baseline estimates of hand hygiene behaviour. Coronavirus infections were identified from nasal swabs using RT-PCR. Poisson mixed models estimated the effect of hand hygiene on personal risk of coronavirus illness, both unadjusted and adjusted for confounding by age and healthcare worker status. Results: Moderate-frequency handwashing (6-10 times per day) predicted a lower personal risk of coronavirus infection (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) =0.64, p=0.04). There was no evidence for a dose-response effect of handwashing, with results for higher levels of hand hygiene (>10 times per day) not significant (aIRR =0.83, p=0.42). Conclusions: This is the first empirical evidence that regular handwashing can reduce personal risk of acquiring seasonal coronavirus infection.

However, there are tensions between GHS and UHC strategy and implementation. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between GHS and UHC using two recent quantitative indices. METHODS: We conducted a macro-analysis to determine the presence of relationship between GHS index (GHSI) and UHC index (UHCI). We calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination. Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 25 with a 95% level of confidence. FINDINGS: There is a moderate and significant relationship between GHSI and UHCI (r = 0.662, p<0.001) and individual indices of UHCI (maternal and child health and infectious diseases: r = 0.623 (p<0.001) and 0.594 (p<0.001), respectively). However, there is no relationship between GHSI and the non-communicable diseases (NCDs) index (r = 0.063, p>0.05). The risk of GHS threats a significant and negative correlation with the capacity for GHS (r = -0.604, p<0.001) and the capacity for UHC (r = -0.792, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The aspiration for GHS will not be realized without UHC; hence, the tension between these two global health agendas should be transformed into a synergistic solution. We argue that strengthening the health systems, in tandem with the principles of primary health care, and implementing a “One Health” approach will progressively enable countries to achieve both UHC and GHS towards a healthier and safer world that everyone aspires to live in.","Assefa, Yibeltal; Hill, Peter S.; Gilks, Charles F.; Damme, Wim Van; van de Pas, Remco; Woldeyohannes, Solomon; Reid, Simon",PLoS One,579,21

Therefore, it is of critical importance to understand processes shaping the indoor microbiomes in educational facilities to protect public health by reducing potential exposure risks of students and the broader community. In this study, the indoor surface bacterial microbiomes were characterized in two multifunctional university buildings with contrasting levels of human occupancy, of which one was recently constructed with minimal human occupancy while the other had been in full operation for six years. Higher levels of human occupancy in the older building were shown to result in greater microbial abundance in the indoor environment and greater proportion of the indoor surface bacterial microbiomes contributed from human-associated microbiota, particularly the skin microbiota. It was further revealed that human-associated microbiota had greater influence on the indoor surface bacterial microbiomes in areas of high occupancy than areas of low occupancy. Consistent with minimal impact from human occupancy in a new construction, the indoor microbiomes in the new building exhibited significantly lower influence from human-associated microbiota than in the older building, with microbial taxa originating from soil and plants representing the dominant constituents of the indoor surface bacterial microbiomes. In contrast, microbial taxa in the older building with extensive human occupancy were represented by constituents of the human microbiota, likely from occupants. These findings provide insights into processes shaping the indoor microbiomes which will aid the development of effective strategies to control microbial exposure risks of occupants in educational facilities.

The sensitivity of sVNT for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its kinetics were determined. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this study. Majority of the patients were 21–40 years old (67%) and 63% had mild symptoms. The sensitivity of sVNT for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 99% (95% confidence interval (CI) 94.4–100%) and the specificity was 100% (95% CI 98.3–100%). The negative predictive value of sVNT from the samples collected before and after 7 days of symptom onset was 99.5% (95% CI 97.4–100%) and 100% (95% CI 93.8–100%), respectively. The level of inhibition at days 8–14 were significantly higher than days 0–7 (p<0.001). The median %inhibition values by severity of COVID-19 symptoms were 79.9% (interquartile range (IQR) 49.7–91.8%); 89.0% (IQR 71.2–92.4%); and 86.6% (IQR 69.5–92.8%), for mild, moderate and severe/critical symptoms respectively. The median level of sVNT %inhibition of severe was significantly higher than the mild group (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: The sVNT is a practical and robust serological test for SARS-CoV-2 infection and does not require specialized biosafety containment. It can be used clinically to aid diagnosis in both early and late infection especially in cases when the real-time RT-PCR results in weakly negative or weakly positive, and to determine the protective immune response from SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients.","Putcharoen, Opass; Wacharapluesadee, Supaporn; Chia, Wan Ni; Paitoonpong, Leilani; Tan, Chee Wah; Suwanpimolkul, Gompol; Jantarabenjakul, Watsamon; Ruchisrisarod, Chanida; Wanthong, Phanni; Sophonphan, Jiratchaya; Chariyavilaskul, Pajaree; Wang, Lin-Fa; Hemachudha, Thiravat",PLoS One,579,27

It is characterized by distinct patterns of disease progression implying a diverse host immune response. However, the immunological features and molecular mechanisms involved in Covid-19 severity remain so far poorly known. Methods: We performed an integrated immune analysis that included in-depth phenotypical profiling of immune cells, whole-blood transcriptomic and cytokine quantification on a cohort of fifty Covid19 patients with a spectrum of disease severity. All patient were tested 8 to 12 days following first symptoms and in absence of anti-inflammatory therapy. Results: A unique phenotype in severe and critically ill patients was identified. It consists in a profoundly impaired interferon (IFN) type I response characterized by a low interferon production and activity, with consequent downregulation of interferon-stimulated genes. This was associated with a persistent blood virus load and an exacerbated inflammatory response that was partially driven by the transcriptional factor NFκB. It was also characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 production and signaling as well as increased innate immune chemokines. Conclusion: We propose that type-I IFN deficiency in the blood is a hallmark of severe Covid-19 and could identify and define a high-risk population. Our study provides a rationale for testing IFN administration combined with adapted anti-inflammatory therapy targeting IL-6 or TNF-α in most severe patients. These data also raise concern for utilization of drugs that interfere with the IFN pathway.","Hadjadj, Jerome; Yatim, Nader; Barnabei, Laura; Corneau, Aurelien; Boussier, Jeremy; Pere, Helene; Charbit, Bruno; Bondet, Vincent; Chenevier-Gobeaux, Camille; Breillat, Paul; Carlier, Nicolas; Gauzit, Remy; Morbieu, Caroline; Pene, Frederic; Marin, Nathalie; Roche, Nicolas; Szwebel, Tali-Anne; Smith, Nikaia; Merkling, Sarah; Treluyer, Jean-Marc; Veyer, David; Mouthon, Luc; Blanc, Catherine; Tharaux, Pierre-Louis; Rozenberg, Flore; Fischer, Alain; Duffy, Darragh; Rieux-Laucat, Frederic; Kerneis, Solen; Terrier, Benjamin",,579,24

However, clinical trials have revealed that the co-administration of CQ and AZM resulted in severe side effects, including cardiac arrhythmia, in patients with COVID-19. To elucidate the cardiotoxicity induced by CQ and AZM, we examined the effects of these drugs based on the electrophysiological properties of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) using multi-electrode arrays. CQ treatment significantly increased the field potential duration, which corresponds to prolongation of the QT interval, and decreased the spike amplitude, spike slope, and conduction velocity of hESC-CMs. AZM had no significant effect on the field potentials of hESC-CMs. However, CQ in combination with AZM greatly increased the field potential duration and decreased the beat period and spike slope of hESC-CMs when compared with CQ monotherapy. In support of the clinical data suggesting the cardiovascular side effects of the combination therapy of CQ and AZM, our results suggest that AZM reinforces the cardiotoxicity induced by CQ in hESC-CMs.","Kim, Ye Seul; Lee, Soo Yong; Yoon, Jung Won; Kim, Dasol; Yu, Sangbin; Kim, Jeong Su; Kim, Jae Ho",BMB Rep,579,20

Quand les moyens habituels de réanimation n’étaient plus suffisants, la mise en place de l’ ‘’Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation’’ ou ECMO a été nécessaire pour certains. Objectif: Toute la problématique de la prise en charge de ces malades en cette période de pandémie a été de gérer le fonctionnement de la machine d’ECMO habituellement réservée aux centres experts et spécialisés en la matière. Méthodes: Le service de chirurgie cardio-vasculaire du CHU La Rabta de Tunis a tenté l’expérience de gestion à distance des ECMO implantées dans les différentes réanimations de Grand Tunis en utilisant la télémédecine et les réseaux sociaux. Ainsi un groupe de discussion Facebook- Messenger a été créé et a permis la régie des malades sous ECMO via des vidéoconférences en temps réel et instantané faisant participer tous les intervenants. Résultats: Un appel était lancé à chaque fois que le médecin en charge du patient en avait besoin. La vidéo a permis de discuter avec les chirurgiens et les perfusionnistes en temps réel des complications ou des problèmes posés par ces malades. Leur état clinique et leurs constantes vitales étaient partagés en permanence sur le groupe de discussion. Suite aux directives des chirurgiens experts et aux échanges faits sur le groupe, le médecin réanimateur pouvait alors intervenir sur tel ou tel paramètre. Conclusion: Les réseaux sociaux ont envahi le quotidien de tous et les professionnels de santé n'échappent pas à cette tendance. La pandémie de la Covid 19 n’a fait que renforcer cette alternative numérique dans un but d’efficacité et d’intérêt pour les patients. Si leur utilisation dans un cadre professionnel offre de nombreux avantages, elle doit toutefois se faire dans le respect des règles de déontologie et apporter une vraie plus-value à leur activité. Introduction: In Tunisia, as elsewhere in the world, severe forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to SARS-Covid19 have been observed. When the usual means of resuscitation were no longer sufficient, the implementation of the Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO was needed. Aim: The whole problem of the management of these patients in this pandemic period has been to manage the operation of the ECMO machine, usually reserved for expert and specialized centers in the field. Methods: The cardio-vascular surgery department of La Rabta teaching hospital of Tunis has tried the experience of management of ECMO implanted in the different reanimations of Tunis, remotely, using telemedicine and social networks. Thus, a Facebook-Messenger discussion group was created and enabled the management of patients under ECMO via video conferencing in real time involving all stakeholders. Results: A call was made whenever the physician needed it. The video provided an opportunity to discuss with surgeons and perfusionists in real time the complications or problems of these patients. Their clinical status was continuously shared on the focus group. Following the instructions of the expert surgeons and the exchanges made on the group, the reanimator could then intervene on this or that parameter. Conclusion: Social media have invaded everyone’s daily lives and health professionals are not exception to this trend. The Covid-19 pandemic has only strengthened this digital alternative with the goal of efficiency and patient interest. While their use in a professional setting offers many advantages, it must nevertheless be done in compliance with the rules of ethics and bring real added value.","Sobhi, Mleyhi; Jalel, Ziadi; Yasmine, Ben Hmida; Faker, Ghédira; Melek, Ben Mrad; Raouf, Denguir",Ann Cardiol Angeiol (Paris),579,23

Methods: We collected dates of patients from Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Jinhua city and so on who had the clear exposure history of a novel coronavirus pneumonia(COVID-19). We retrospected demographic data, exposure time, onset time, visiting time and positive time for novel coronavirus nucleic acid detection in respiratory specimens. There were 256 patients from January 20, 2020-February 12,2020 from eight cities included in our study. 106 cases appeared symptoms before January 25th and 150 after. Results: There were 136(53.1%)male infected cases. The mean age of all patients was 43.80 {+/-} 14.85.The median time from exposure to onset was 5(3,8)days.The median time of the first time of positive nucleic acid detection was 11(9,14)days and mode number was 13.The median time from onset to the first time of positive nucleic acid detection was 6(4,8)days and mode number was 5.

Moreover, it seems that even in patients with normal glycaemic status, COVID-19 may predispose to the development of hyperglycaemia which modulates immune mechanisms and inflammatory responses, with direct effects on morbidity and mortality. Thus, taking into account these scientific data, as well as the increased frequency of diabetes in the general population, we aimed to assess the risk of an unfavourable outcome of diabetic patients, which is in a strong connection with the presence and severity of pulmonary disease such as interstitial pneumonia/bronchopneumonia, as well as the effectiveness of Tocilizumab administration. The results of our study indicate a three-fold higher risk of death in patients with diabetes and COVID-19 (RR = 3.03; IC95%: 2.37–3.86; p = 0.001),compared to nondiabetic patients, and the risk of developing severe forms of acute respiratory failure was 1.5 times higher in the first studied category. In conclusion, we can say that the diabetic diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection is more predisposed to immunological and organic dysfunctions that may ultimately result in death, and treatment with monoclonal anti-IL-6 antibodies was more effective in diabetic patients than non-diabetics (p < 0.05). The effectiveness of Tocilizumab was significant in both studied groups, but diabetic patients responded better to this therapy compared to non-diabetes-mellitus (DM) ones (76.7% vs. 35% p = 0.001).","Miftode, Egidia; Miftode, Larisa; Coman, Ioana; Prepeliuc, Cristian; Obreja, Maria; Stămăteanu, Oana; Părângă, Tudorița Gabriela; Leca, Daniela; Pleşca, Claudia Elena",Healthcare (Basel),579,16

I then built a detection method, CodScr, based on this selection pressure. Finally, I combined CodScr with methods that detect other properties of overlapping genes, such as a biased nucleotide and amino acid composition. I detected two novel ORFs (ORF-Sh and ORF-Mh), overlapping the spike and membrane genes respectively, which are under selection pressure and may be beneficial to SARS-CoV-2.

When this balance is compromised by external or internal stress signals, it very often leads to disease as is the case in fibrotic conditions. Fibrosis occurs in the context of defective tissue repair and is characterized by the excessive, aberrant and debilitating deposition of fibril-forming collagens. Therefore, the numerous proteins involved in the biosynthesis of fibrillar collagens represent a potential and still underexploited source of therapeutic targets to prevent fibrosis. One such target is procollagen C-proteinase enhancer-1 (PCPE-1) which has the unique ability to accelerate procollagen maturation by BMP-1/tolloid-like proteinases (BTPs) and contributes to trigger collagen fibrillogenesis, without interfering with other BTP functions or the activities of other extracellular metalloproteinases. This role is achieved through a fine-tuned mechanism of action that is close to being elucidated and offers promising perspectives for drug design. Finally, the in vivo data accumulated in recent years also confirm that PCPE-1 overexpression is a general feature and early marker of fibrosis. In this review, we describe the results which presently support the driving role of PCPE-1 in fibrosis and discuss the questions that remain to be solved to validate its use as a biomarker or therapeutic target.","Lagoutte, Priscillia; Bettler, Emmanuel; Vadon-Le Goff, Sandrine; Moali, Catherine",Matrix Biol Plus,579,19

Design Qualitative thematic analysis. Setting Community-based. Participants We interviewed 8 community-dwelling low-income adults with chronic stroke (≥ 3 months) and mild-to-moderate disability (NIH Stroke Scale ≤16) who enrolled in the ENGAGE Pilot Study (NCT04019275) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research staff (n=4), peer facilitators (n=2), and occupational therapist facilitators (n=2) were also interviewed. Interventions ENGAGE blends social learning, guided discovery, and skills training to facilitate community and social participation. The 8-session curriculum was adapted for delivery via videoconferencing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Peer and occupational therapy facilitators led the groups. Main Outcome Measures Semi-structured interviews were conducted. Interviews were transcribed, annotated, and coded by 3 researchers. Results were member checked. Results Stakeholders reported that they valued participation in the intervention using videoconferencing and connectedness through shared experiences. Some participants felt more comfortable sharing experiences over videoconferencing than in person. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted participants and facilitators to identify creative approaches to community and social participation. All stakeholders highlighted technical and social components of using videoconferencing that should be included in training at the beginning of remotely delivered interventions. Learning occurred over the duration of the group sessions rather than during one training session. Group facilitators also described strategies for navigating technical challenges and engaging participants during online group sessions. Conclusions Group-based interventions delivered via videoconferencing may facilitate valuable social learning experiences after stroke. Videoconferencing training should address technical skills and social expectations. Future research should explore stakeholder preferences for virtual or face-to-face group interventions, virtual group processes, and optimal training strategies to facilitate technology uptake.

We evaluated immune responses to the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine in solid tumor patients (n=52) on active cytotoxic anti-cancer therapy. These responses were compared to a control cohort that also received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (n=50). Using live SARS-CoV-2 assays, neutralizing antibodies were detected in 67% and 80% of cancer patients after the first and second immunizations, respectively, with a 3-fold increase in median titers after the booster. Similar trends were observed in serum antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S2 regions of Spike protein, and in IFNγ+Spike-specific T cells. The magnitude of each of these responses was diminished relative to the control cohort. We therefore quantified RBD− and Spike S1-specific memory B cell subsets as predictors of anamnestic responses to viral exposures or additional immunizations. After the second vaccination, Spike-specific plasma cell-biased memory B cells were observed in most cancer patients at levels similar to those of the control cohort after the first immunization. These data suggest that a third immunization might elevate antibody responses in cancer patients to levels seen in healthy individuals after the second dose. Trials should be conducted to test these predictions.","Shroff, Rachna T.; Chalasani, Pavani; Wei, Ran; Pennington, Daniel; Quirk, Grace; Schoenle, Marta V.; Uhrlaub, Jennifer L.; Ripperger, Tyler J.; Jergović, Mladen; Dalgai, Shelby; Wolf, Alexander; Hammad, Hytham; Carrier, Amy; Scott, Aaron J.; Nikolich-Žugich, Janko; Worobey, Michael; Sprissler, Ryan; Dake, Michael; LaFleur, Bonnie J.; Bhattacharya, Deepta",medRxiv,579,26

Reported risk factors for severe COVID-19 presentation include older age, medical comorbidities, and cardiac disease - many of which apply to patients with HM (Guan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Additionally, patients with HM may be at even higher risk of infections with or complications from SARS-CoV-2 due to immune dysfunction from their underlying disease or treatment (He et al., 2020). However, data regarding rates of infection and outcomes in this population are limited. Here we describe the demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, presenting symptoms, treatment, and outcomes of a cohort of patients with HM and COVID-19 infection at network sites across the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center- Jefferson Health. Methods: We created an HM-specific COVID-19 database within our health system. Patients were identified for inclusion in the database by physician referral and query of the electronic medical record. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data, therapy details, and outcomes on patients were obtained by accessing electronic medical records. A retrospective study of patients with a diagnosis of a HM- within 5 years of COVID-19 diagnosis-and a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were was conducted using this database. A confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result on a real-time RT-PCR assay of a specimen collected by nasopharyngeal swab. Results: More than 3,000 telehealth or in-person patient visits were conducted for patients with HM in the Jefferson Health Network between March 9, 2020 and July 15, 2020. During that period, 21 patients with HM had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Median age was 67 years (range 21-89). The majority of patients (86%) had at least 1 comorbid medical condition, and 76% had a history of tobacco use. The most common HM was multiple myeloma (7/21, 33%), followed by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (3/21, 14%). 12/21 (52%) patients were on active cancer treatment at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, and patients had received a median of 2 lines of cancer therapy (range 0-6). All 12 patients who were on active therapy at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis experienced a treatment interruption. Two patients had undergone prior autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) and 1 had undergone prior allogeneic SCT. Details on HM diagnosis and treatment are presented in Table 1. Twenty patients required hospital admission at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, 7/21 were admitted to the ICU, and 6/21 required intubation. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (48%), cough (43%), and shortness of breath (43%), and lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <1,000 B/L) was common at presentation (56%). More than half (13/21, 62%) of patients received some COVID-19 directed therapy, while 8 were treated with supportive care alone. As of July 15, 2020 18/21 (86%) patients were alive. Characteristics of the 3 patients who died are described in Table 2. Conclusion : In contrast to published reports, we found that the number of confirmed COVID-19 in patients with HM at our center was surprisingly low, with only 21 cases in 4 months. Furthermore, the mortality rate of 14% was lower than expected when compared to published cohorts of similar patients, which have shown mortality rates as high as 40% (He et al., 2020; Malard et al., 2020; Martín-Moro et al., 2020). Postulated reasons for the low number of infections include the early adoption of universal masking and robust utilization of telehealth to promote social distancing. In our small cohort, multiple myeloma was the most frequent HM diagnosis associated with COVID-19 infection, but this may be related to the prevalence of MM in our geographic area. The vast majority of HM patients with symptomatic COVID-19 were former smokers. Disclosures Binder: Janssen: Membership on an entity's Board of Directors or advisory committees; Sanofi: Consultancy.

Despite some advances in drug treatments of medical complications in the later stages of the disease, the pandemic's death toll is tragic, as no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment is currently available. By using a systems approach, we identify the host‐encoded pathway, which provides ribonucleotides to viral RNA synthesis, as a possible target. We show that methotrexate, an FDA‐approved inhibitor of purine biosynthesis, potently inhibits viral RNA replication, viral protein synthesis, and virus release. The effective antiviral methotrexate concentrations are similar to those used for established human therapies using the same drug. Methotrexate should be most effective in patients at the earliest appearance of symptoms to effectively prevent viral replication, diffusion of the infection, and possibly fatal complications.","Caruso, Arnaldo; Caccuri, Francesca; Bugatti, Antonella; Zani, Alberto; Vanoni, Marco; Bonfanti, Paolo; Cazzaniga, Marina E.; Perno, Carlo F.; Messa, Cristina; Alberghina, Lilia",J Med Virol,579,24

Within only a few months, more than a thousand studies on this topic have already appeared in the scientific literature. In this short review, we analyse the bibliometric aspects of these studies on a macro level, as well as those addressing Coronaviruses in general. Furthermore, through a scoping analysis of the literature on COVID-19, we identify the main safety-related dimensions that these studies have thus far addressed. Our findings show that across various research domains, and apart from the medical and clinical aspects such as the safety of vaccines and treatments, issues related to patient transport safety, occupational safety of healthcare professionals, biosafety of laboratories and facilities, social safety, food safety, and particularly mental/psychological health and domestic safety have thus far attracted most attention of the scientific community in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis also uncovers various potentially significant safety problems caused by this global health emergency which currently have attracted only limited scientific focus but may warrant more attention. These include matters such as cyber safety, economic safety, and supply-chain safety. These findings highlight why, from an academic research perspective, a holistic interdisciplinary approach and a collective scientific effort is required to help understand and mitigate the various safety impacts of this crisis whose implications reach far beyond the bio-medical risks. Such holistic safety-scientific understanding of the COVID-19 crisis can furthermore be instrumental to be better prepared for a future pandemic.","Haghani, Milad; Bliemer, Michiel C.J.; Goerlandt, Floris; Li, Jie",Saf Sci,579,24

While vaccines are still under development, social distancing, extensive testing, and quarantining of confirmed infected subjects remain the most effective measures to contain the pandemic. These measures carry a significant socioeconomic cost. In this work, we introduce a novel optimization-based decision-making framework for managing the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. This includes modeling the dynamics of affected populations, estimating the model parameters and hidden states from data, and an optimal control strategy for sequencing social distancing and testing events such that the number of infections is minimized. The analysis of our extensive computational efforts reveals that social distancing and quarantining are most effective when implemented early, with quarantining of confirmed infected subjects having a much higher impact. Further, we find that “on-off” policies alternating between strict social distancing and relaxing such restrictions can be effective at “flattening” the curve while likely minimizing social and economic cost.","Tsay, Calvin; Lejarza, Fernando; Stadtherr, Mark A.; Baldea, Michael",Sci Rep,579,1

It occurs especially when vasopressin is utilized as an adjunct vasopressor in non-septic shock states. 1 CASE PRESENTATION: 35-year-old Hispanic female without any comorbidities was hospitalized at our institution at the peak of COVID-19 pandemic in New York due to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support and ultimately had to be placed on VV Extracorporeal membrane oxygen (ECMO) support for refractory ARDS. Patient required high doses of intravenous (IV) sedation while on ECMO, with ketamine, hydromorphone and versed. Subsequently, she developed worsening hypotension requiring vasopressor support with low to medium doses of nor-epinephrine (NE) infusion. Fixed dose vasopressin infusion was started in an effort to wean off NE infusion. Serum sodium trended down from 139 to 123 in following four days. Urine output (UOP) progressively dropped from >125 ml/hour to <50 ml/hour after starting vasopressin infusion, with a normal to unchanged BUN (10) and creatinine (0.4). Routine hyponatremia evaluation was consistent with urinary sodium-159;urine osmolarity-937;urine specific gravity >1.035;calculated serum osmolarity-258;serum cortisol-4.7 and TSH-T4 of 0.948-0.8. Renal evaluation was obtained, vasopressin infusion was discontinued with a subsequent strong diuretic effect and a rapid correction in serum sodium. Patient was already on antibiotics for ventilator associated pneumonia, but shock was not attributed to sepsis considering patient was afebrile with a downtrend in leukocytosis preceding hyponatremia. DISCUSSION: Vasopressin is widely used for co-administration with catecholamines to obtain a dose sparing effect in septic shock. 1 Vasopressin due to an antidiuretic activity via renal V2 receptors can result in decreased in UOP with a secondary hyponatremic effect by causing a state of iatrogenic SIADH. 2 Developing hyponatremia shortly after vasopressin infusion and an anti-diuretic effect should be considered a strong indicator of vasopressin as an underlying etiology. CONCLUSIONS: Vasopressin use an adjunct vasopressor should be avoided in non-septic shock states to prevent a state of hyponatremia and a state of water intoxication. A state of volume overload may have a secondary negative impact on ventilator weaning. REFERENCE #1: Dunser MW, Mayr AJ, Ulmer H, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 4 cases of metapneumovirus pneumonia (mean age of 52.3 years) in an institutional outbreak (Castle Peak Hospital) in 2008 and 38 cases of SARS-coronovirus (mean age of 39.6 years) admitted to Tuen Mun hospital during an epidemic outbreak in 2003 were included. HRCT findings of the lungs for all patients were retrospectively reviewed by two independent radiologists. RESULTS: In the metapneumovirus group, common HRCT features were ground glass opacities (100%), consolidation (100%), parenchymal band (100%), bronchiectasis (75%). Crazy paving pattern was absent. They were predominantly subpleural and basal in location and bilateral involvement was observed in 50% of patients. In the SARS group, common HRCT features were ground glass opacities (92.1%), interlobular septal thickening (86.8%), crazy paving pattern (73.7%) and consolidation (68%). Bronchiectasis was not seen. Majority of patient demonstrated segmental or lobar in distribution and bilateral involvement was observed in 44.7% of patients. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were of consistent rare features in both groups. CONCLUSION: Ground glass opacities, interlobular septal thickening and consolidations were consistent HRCT manifestations in both metapneumovirus infection and SARS. The presence of bronchiectasis (0% in SARS) may point towards metapneumovirus while crazy paving pattern is more suggestive of SARS.","Wong, Cheuk Kei Kathy; Lai, Vincent; Wong, Yiu Chung",Eur J Radiol,579,10

First, the theoretical pI values, based on the amino acid (AA) sequences of the proteins, were calculated using the ProtParam tool from the Bioinformatics Resource Portal ExPASy. The proteins were then measured with the Maurice imaged CIEF system (native fluorescence detection), testing various measurement conditions, such as different ampholytes or ampholyte mixtures. Due to isoforms, we get sections with several peaks and not just one peak for each protein. The determined pI range for the RBD/Fc is 8.24–9.32 (theoretical pI: 8.55), for the RBD/His it is 7.36–9.88 (8.91) and for the S1/His it is 7.30–8.37 (7.80). The pI range of the S1/S2/His is 4.41–5.87 (no theoretical pI, AA sequence unknown) and for hACE2/His, the determined global range is 5.19–6.11 (5.60) for all experimental conditions chosen. All theoretically derived values were found within these ranges, usually close to the center. Therefore, we consider theoretical values as useful to make predictions about the isoelectric points of SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins. The experimental conditions had only a minor influence on the pI ranges obtained and mainly influenced the peak shapes.","Krebs, Finja; Scheller, Christin; Grove‐Heike, Kristina; Pohl, Lena; Wätzig, Hermann",Electrophoresis,579,26

As a result, systems report record losses, while demand for emergency room, hospital, and intensive care beds have surged. Studies have admitted that many surgeries are unnecessary, and physician leaders admit that profit plays a role in driving such needless cost and risk. Most diseases are better managed with medications and lifestyle changes. But it pays more to replace a knee than to prevent that replacement. We must bring surgical and medical value closer in-line. Communities of color are suffering disproportionately from coronavirus. The social determinants of health that lead to higher concentrations of hypertension and diabetes can be mitigated by investment in primary care. Such investment has been proven to decrease cost and increase quality of life. However, the United States spends 50% less on primary care, than other developed countries. While showing promise, telehealth is not a panacea. It relies on continued reimbursement parity, and there remains a digital divide. Any meaningful fix will draw the ire from those who profit from such a profligate system.

The participants in the analysis consisted of adults over 18 years of age. Clinical data from 35,804 patients who developed ARDS and controls were used to generate predictive models that identify risk for ARDS onset up to 12-hours before satisfying the Berlin criteria. We identified salient features from the electronic medical record that predicted respiratory failure among this population. The machine learning algorithm which provided the best performance exhibited AUROC of 0.89 (95% CI = 0.88–0.90), sensitivity of 0.77 (95% CI = 0.75–0.78), specificity 0.85 (95% CI = 085–0.86). Validation performance across two separate health systems (comprising 899 COVID-19 patients) exhibited AUROC of 0.82 (0.81–0.83) and 0.89 (0.87, 0.90). Important features for prediction of ARDS included minimum oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), standard deviation of the systolic blood pressure (SBP), O(2) flow, and maximum respiratory rate over an observational window of 16-hours. Analyzing the performance of the model across various cohorts indicates that the model performed best among a younger age group (18–40) (AUROC = 0.93 [0.92–0.94]), compared to an older age group (80+) (AUROC = 0.81 [0.81–0.82]). The model performance was comparable on both male and female groups, but performed significantly better on the severe ARDS group compared to the mild and moderate groups.

Data were collected by means of questionnaires and responsive interviews with 22 educators, then analyzed with the use of grounded theory and the constant comparative method. Four notions of GCE emerged from the data. The Japanese educators expressed the opinion that GCE must: (1) foster students’ sense of social efficiency and economic growth; (2) enhance their English-language proficiency to prepare them for work in the global market; (3) encourage overseas experiences to support them in acquiring global consciousness; and (4) develop students’ understanding of different countries. Based on the findings, the study suggests that educators’ approaches to GCE in Japan are generally oriented toward neoliberal notions of GCE aimed at fostering global human resources rather than critical global citizens. In contrast, this paper concludes by proposing a critical framework informed by the values of critical pedagogy ingrained in social justice to teach GCE in Japanese universities. This approach to GCE challenges dominant neoliberal notions of the linkages between globalization and education and orients learners toward social justice.","Bosio, Emiliano",Prospects (Paris),579,1

Introduction: It is not yet possible to estimate the proportion of patients with COVID-19 who present distinguishable classical neurological symptoms and syndromes. The objective of this study is to estimate the incidence of sensory symptoms (hypoaesthesia, paraesthesia, and hyperalgesia) in physicians who have presented the disease at Hospital Universitario Fundación Alcorcón (HUFA) in Madrid; to establish the relationship between sensory symptoms and the presence of other signs of infection; and to study their association with the severity of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional, retrospective, observational study. HUFA physicians who presented SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 March and 25 July 2020 were included in the study. A voluntary, anonymous survey was distributed via corporate email. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were collected from professionals with PCR- or serology-confirmed COVID-19. Results. The survey was sent to 801 physicians and we received 89 responses. The mean age of respondents was 38.28 years. A total of 17.98% presented sensory symptoms. A significant relationship was found between the presence of paraesthesia and cough, fever, myalgia, asthaenia, and dyspnoea. A significant relationship was also found between paraesthesia and the need for treatment and admission due to COVID-19. Sensory symptoms were present from the fifth day of illness in 87.4% of cases. Conclusions. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be associated with sensory symptoms, mostly in severe cases. Sensory symptoms often appear after a time interval, and may be caused by a parainfectious syndrome with an autoimmunity background.","Cantero, Diego Gayoso; Pavón, Estefanía Cantador; Fernández, Elia Pérez; López, María Elena Novillo",Neurologia,579,11

Previous outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS had evidenced potential threats of coronaviruses in human health. The recent pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 is overwhelming and has been going beyond control. Vaccines and antiviral drugs are ungently required to mitigate the pandemic. Therefore, it is important to comprehend the mechanistic details of viral infection process. The fusion between host cell and virus being the first step of infection, understanding the fusion mechanism could provide crucial information to intervene the infection process. Interestingly, all enveloped viruses contain fusion protein on their envelope that acts as fusion machine. For coronaviruses, the spike or S glycoprotein mediates successful infection through receptor binding and cell fusion. The cell fusion process requires merging of virus and host cell membranes, and that is essentially performed by the S2 domain of the S glycoprotein. In this review, we have discussed cell fusion mechanism of SARS-CoV-1 from available atomic resolution structures and membrane binding of fusion peptides. We have further discussed about the cell fusion of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of present pandemic situation.","Chakraborty, Hirak; Bhattacharjya, Surajit",Biophys Chem,579,1

Methods: The phase 3 portion of this adaptive, randomized, master protocol, included 4,057 Covid-19 outpatients with one or more risk factors for severe disease. Patients were randomized to a single treatment of intravenous placebo, or various doses of REGEN-COV, and followed for 28 days. The prespecified hierarchical analysis first compared REGEN-COV 2400mg dose vs concurrent placebo, then compared the 1200mg dose vs concurrent placebo, for endpoints assessing risk of hospitalization or death, and time to symptom resolution. Safety was evaluated in all treated patients. Results: Both REGEN-COV 2400mg and 1200mg significantly reduced Covid-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death compared to placebo (71.3% reduction [1.3% vs 4.6%; p<0.0001] and 70.4% reduction [1.0% vs 3.2%; p=0.0024], respectively). The median time to resolution of Covid-19 symptoms was 4 days shorter in both dose arms vs placebo (10 vs 14 days; p<0.0001). Efficacy of REGEN-COV was consistent across subgroups, including patients who were SARS-CoV-2 serum antibody-positive at baseline. REGEN-COV more rapidly reduced viral load than placebo. Serious adverse events occurred more frequently in the placebo group (4.0%) than in the 1200mg (1.1%) and 2400mg (1.3%) groups and grade [≥]2 infusion-related reactions were infrequent (<0.3% in all groups).

Northern South America (NSA) was one of those areas where pollution changed during lockdown due to high fire activity. This study aims to analyze, for the first time in NSA, the behavior of selected criteria air pollutants during the implementation of the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown in two high populated cities of the region: Bogotá and Medellín in Colombia. A set of tools including surface measurements, as well as satellite and modeled data were used. 24-hour average concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 were collected from air quality stations for the lockdown period ranging from February 21 to June 30, 2020. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) was used to analyze the fire flux OC as a biomass burning (BB) indicator, and tropospheric NO2 concentrations were retrieved from TROPOMI. The HYSPLIT model was used to analyze back trajectories and fire data were obtained from MODIS sensor measurements. Our analysis shows short-term background NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 concentration reductions of 60%, 44%, and 40%, respectively, for the strict lockdown; and 62%, 58%, and 69% for the relaxed lockdown. Corresponding long-term reductions were of 50%, 32%, and 9% for the strict lockdown; and 37%, 29%, and 19% for the relaxed lockdown. Regional BB increased PM2.5 concentrations by 20 μg/m3 during the strict lockdown, and the Saharan dust event increased PM10 concentrations up to 168 μg/m3 in Bogotá, and 104 μg/m3 in Medellín, bringing an additional risk of morbidity and mortality for population. Regional BB has several causes that need to be properly managed to benefit local air quality improvement plans. Future cleaner transport policies equivalent to reduced lockdown mobility could bring pollution close to WHO guidelines.","Mendez-Espinosa, J. F.; Rojas, N. Y.; Vargas, J.; Pachón, J.

This paper examines the strategies used by management in response to austerity in the three public hospitals and their effect on organisational functioning. METHODS: We used a comparative qualitative case study approach, collecting data using a combination of in-depth interviews with managers, and focus group discussion and interviews with shop stewards and staff. RESULTS: Austerity, imposed by the introduction of a provincial cost containment committee, has led to a reduction in staff, benefits, shortages of equipment and delayed procurement and recruitment processes. Managers in the first hospital maintained training on labour relations for staff and managers, they jointly planned how to cope with reduced staff and initiated a new forum for HR and finance staff. These strategies improved the way actors engaged, enabling them to resolve problems. Good communication ensured that staff understood what was within the hospitals control and what was not. A second hospital relied on absorptive strategies, such as asking staff to do more with less. The result was resistance, and greater use of sick leave. Some staff gave their own money to help feed patients but were angry at management for putting them in this difficult position. Leadership in the third hospital did not manage actors well either; help from the Government’s Expanded Public Works Programme was rejected by the unions, managers did not attend meetings as they felt their contributions were not listened to. Poor communication meant that the managers and staff did not understand what was within the hospital’s control and what was not; a misunderstanding led to a physical fight between managers. CONCLUSION: Organisational resilience in the face of austerity requires leaders to manage different stakeholders well. Hospital managers who promote democratic or participatory leadership and management, open communication, teamwork and trust among all stakeholders will lead better functioning organisations. A special focus should be placed on such practices to develop the resilience of health systems’ organisations.","Fana, Thanduxolo; Goudge, Jane",BMJ Glob Health,579,18

Epidemiological studies focused on the influence of outdoor air pollution (AP) on COVID-19 risk have produced inconsistent conclusions. We aimed to quantitatively explore this association using a meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched for studies related to outdoor AP and COVID-19 risk in the Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. No language restriction was utilized. The search date entries were up to August 13, 2021. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained with random-/fixed-effects models. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021244656. RESULTS: A total of 35 articles were eligible for the meta-analysis. For long-term exposure to AP, COVID-19 incidence was positively associated with 1 μg/m(3) increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO(2); effect size = 1.042, 95% CI 1.017–1.068), particulate matter with diameter <2.5 μm (PM(2.5); effect size = 1.056, 95% CI 1.039–1.072), and sulfur dioxide (SO(2); effect size = 1.071, 95% CI 1.002–1.145). The COVID-19 mortality was positively associated with 1 μg/m(3) increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO(2); effect size = 1.034, 95% CI 1.006–1.063), PM(2.5) (effect size = 1.047, 95% CI 1.025–1.1071). For short-term exposure to air pollutants, COVID-19 incidence was positively associated with 1 unit increase in air quality index (effect size = 1.001, 95% CI 1.001–1.002), 1 μg/m(3) increase NO(2) (effect size = 1.014, 95% CI 1.011–1.016), particulate matter with diameter <10 μm (PM(10); effect size = 1.005, 95% CI 1.003–1.008), PM(2.5) (effect size = 1.003, 95% CI 1.002–1.004), and SO(2) (effect size = 1.015, 95% CI 1.007–1.023). CONCLUSIONS: Outdoor air pollutants are detrimental factors to COVID-19 outcomes.

Recently, numerous cases of acute limb ischemia (ALI) have been reported although pooled data are lacking. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library for studies published online up to January 2021 that reported cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection and ALI. Eligible studies should have reported early outcomes including mortality. Primary endpoints included also pooled amputation, clinical improvement and reoperation rates. RESULTS: In total, 34 studies (19 case reports and 15 case series/cohort studies) including a total of 540 patients (199 patients were eligible for analysis) were evaluated. All studies were published in 2020. Mean age of patients was 61.6 years (range 39-84 years; data from 32 studies) and 78.4% of patients were of male gender (data from 32 studies). There was a low incidence of comorbidities: arterial hypertension: 49% (29 studies); diabetes mellitus: 29.6% (29 studies); dyslipidemia: 20.5% (27 studies); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: 8.5% (26 studies); coronary disease: 8.3% (26 studies); and chronic renal disease: 7.6% (28 studies). Medical treatment was selected as first-line treatment for 41.8% of cases. Pooled mortality rate among 34 studies reached 31.4% (95% CI = 25.4% to 37.7%). Pooled amputation rate among 34 studies reached 23.2% (95% CI = 17.3% to 29.7%). Pooled clinical improvement rate among 28 studies reached 66.6% (95% CI = 55.4% to 76.9%). Pooled reoperation rate among 29 studies reached 10.5% (95% CI = 5.7% to 16.7%). Medical treatment was associated with a higher death risk compared to any intervention (OR = 4.04; 95% CI [1.075 – 15.197]; P = .045) although amputation risk was not different between the two strategies (OR = .977; 95% CI [.070 – 13.600]; P = .986) (data from 31 studies). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a high risk for thrombotic complications including ALI. Covid-associated ALI presents in patients with a low incidence of comorbidities, and it is associated with a high mortality and amputation risk. Conservative treatment seems to have a higher mortality risk compared to any intervention although amputation risk is similar.","Galyfos, George; Sianou, Argiri; Frountzas, Maximos; Vasilios, Kotsarinis; Vouros, Dimitrios; Theodoropoulos, Charis; Michalopoulou, Victoria; Sigala, Frangiska; Filis, Konstantinos",J Vasc Surg,579,1

METHODS: An online survey exploring physical activity and sedentary behaviour levels of pregnant women with gestational diabetes during COVID-19 was distributed through social media platforms. Women who had been pregnant during the COVID-19 outbreak and had gestational diabetes, were resident in the UK, were 18 years old or over and could understand written English were invited to take part. RESULTS: A total of 724 women accessed the survey, 553 of these met the eligibility criteria and took part in the survey. Sedentary time increased for 79% of the women during the pandemic. Almost half of the women (47%) were meeting the physical activity guidelines pre COVID-19 during their pregnancy, this dropped to 23% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fear of leaving the house due to COVID-19 was the most commonly reported reason for the decline. Significant associations were found between meeting the physical activity guidelines during COVID-19 and educational attainment, fitness equipment ownership and knowledge of how to exercise safely in pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results show the impact of COVID-19 on physical activity and sedentary behaviour levels and highlight the need for targeted public health initiatives as the pandemic continues and for future lockdowns. Women with gestational diabetes need to know how it is safe and beneficial to them to engage in physical activity and ways to do this from their homes if fear of leaving the house due to COVID-19 is a barrier for them. Online physical activity classes provided by certified trainers in physical activity for pregnant women may help them remain active when face-to-face appointments are reduced and limited additional resources are available.","Hillyard, Medbh; Sinclair, Marlene; Murphy, Marie; Casson, Karen; Mulligan, Ciara",PLoS One,579,20

We establish 3 dynamic thresholds separating 4 classes of disease outcomes, spillover, apparent multihost, true multihost, and potential emerging infectious disease; describe possible disease emergence scenarios; outline the population dynamics of each case; and clarify existing terminology. We highlight the utility of this framework with examples of disease threats in human and wildlife populations, showing how it allows us to understand which ecologic factors affect disease emergence and predict the impact of host shifts in a range of disease systems.","Fenton, Andy; Pedersen, Amy B.",Emerg Infect Dis,579,21

However, there is limited information on the quality of antibody responses generated with these vaccine modalities. To better understand antibody responses induced by spike protein-based vaccines, we performed a qualitative study by immunizing rabbits with various SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigens: S-ectodomain (S1+S2) (aa 16-1213), which lacks the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (CT-TM), the S1 domain (aa 16-685), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (aa 319-541), and the S2 domain (aa 686-1213, lacking the RBD, as control). Resulting antibody quality and function were analyzed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), receptor binding domain (RBD) competition assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) against different spike proteins in native conformation, and neutralization assays. All three antigens (S1+S2 ectodomain, S1 domain, and RBD), but not S2, generated strong neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination-induced antibody repertoire was analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 spike genome fragment phage display libraries (SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL), which identified immunodominant epitopes in the S1, S1-RBD, and S2 domains. Furthermore, these analyses demonstrated that the RBD immunogen elicited a higher antibody titer with 5-fold higher affinity antibodies to native spike antigens compared with other spike antigens; and antibody affinity correlated strongly with neutralization titers. These findings may help guide rational vaccine design and facilitate development and evaluation of effective therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19 disease.","Ravichandran, Supriya; Coyle, Elizabeth M.; Klenow, Laura; Tang, Juanjie; Grubbs, Gabrielle; Liu, Shufeng; Wang, Tony; Golding, Hana; Khurana, Surender",Sci Transl Med,579,1

In this study, we investigated the role of autophagy in the replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an agent that has caused devastating losses in the international swine industry since the late 1980s. Using protein quantification and microscopy, we observed that PRRSV infection results in LC3-I/II conversion, an increased accumulation of punctate GFP-LC3-expressing cells, and a higher number of autophagosome-like double-membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm of host cells. Inhibition of autophagy using 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or small interfering RNAs targeting ATG7 and Beclin-1 led to a significant reduction in PRRSV titers and protein expression. Conversely, induction of autophagy by rapamycin resulted in increased viral replication. These results demonstrate that PRRSV infection induces autophagy which, in turn, enhances viral replication efficiency.","Chen, Quangang; Fang, Liurong; Wang, Dang; Wang, Shaohua; Li, Ping; Li, Mao; Luo, Rui; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo",Virus Res,579,13

PROCEDURE: Nasopharyngeal wash specimens were prospectively collected from 60 children with sickle cell disease and acute respiratory illness, over a 1-year period. Samples were tested with multiplexed-PCR, using an automated system for nine respiratory viruses, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis. Clinical characteristics and distribution of respiratory viruses in patients with and without acute chest syndrome (ACS) were evaluated. RESULTS: A respiratory virus was detected in 47 (78%) patients. Nine (15%) patients had ACS; a respiratory virus was detected in all of them. The demographic characteristics of patients with and without ACS were similar. HRV was the most common virus, detected in 29 of 47 (62%) patients. Logistic regression showed no association between ACS and detection of HRV, hCoV, hBoV, hMPV, and other respiratory pathogens. Co-infection with at least one additional respiratory virus was seen in 14 (30%) infected patients, and was not significantly higher in patients with ACS (P=0.10). Co-infections with more than two respiratory viruses were seen in seven patients, all in patients without ACS. Bacterial pathogens were not detected. CONCLUSION: HRV was the most common virus detected in children with sickle cell disease and acute respiratory illness, and was not associated with increased morbidity. Larger prospective studies with asymptomatic controls are needed to study the association of these emerging respiratory viruses with ACS in children with sickle cell disease.","Srinivasan, Ashok; Wang, Winfred C.; Gaur, Aditya; Smith, Teresa; Gu, Zhengming; Kang, Guolian; Leung, Wing; Hayden, Randall T.",Pediatric Blood & Cancer,579,20

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection exhibits similar clinical symptoms and immunopathological sequelae to SARS‐CoV infection. Therefore, much of the developmental progress on SARS‐CoV vaccines can be utilized for the development of SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines. Careful antigen selection during development is always of utmost importance for the production of effective vaccines that do not compromise recipient safety. This holds especially true for SARS‐CoV vaccines, as several immunopathological disorders are associated with the activity of structural and nonstructural proteins encoded in the virus's genetic material. Whole viral protein and RNA‐encoding full‐length proteins contain both protective and “dangerous” sequences, unless pathological fragments are deleted. In light of recent advances, peptide vaccines may present a very safe and effective alternative. Peptide vaccines can avoid immunopathological pro‐inflammatory sequences, focus immune responses on neutralizing immunogenic epitopes, avoid off‐target antigen loss, combine antigens with different protective roles or mechanisms, even from different viral proteins, and avoid mutant escape by employing highly conserved cryptic epitopes. In this review, an attempt is made to exploit the similarities between SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2 in vaccine antigen screening, with particular attention to the pathological and immunogenic properties of SARS proteins.","Shalash, Ahmed O.; Hussein, Waleed M.; Skwarczynski, Mariusz; Toth, Istvan",Adv Sci (Weinh),579,16

It has been verified for four Asian countries, Japan, South Korea, Pakistan, and Nepal. Accordingly, we can gain some valuable experience to better understand the disease evolution, forecast the prevalence of the disease, which can provide sustainable evidence to guide further intervention and management. Random forest with a proper rolling time-window can learn the combined effects of environmental and social factors to accurately predict the daily growth of confirmed cases and daily death rate on a national scale, which is followed by NSGA-II to find a range of Pareto optimal solutions for ensuring the minimization of the infection rate and mortality at the same time. Experimental results demonstrate that the predictive model can alert the local government in advance, allowing the accused time to put forward relevant measures. The temperature in the category of environment and the stringency index belonging to the social factor are identified as the top 2 important features to exert a greater impact on the virus transmission. Moreover, optimal solutions provide references to design the best control strategies towards pandemic containment and prevention that can accommodate the country-specific circumstance, which are possible to decrease the two objectives by more than 95%. In particular, appropriate adjustment of social-related features needs to take priority over others, since it can bring about at least 1.47% average improvement of two objectives compared to environmental factors.","Pan, Yue; Zhang, Limao; Yan, Zhenzhen; Lwin, May O.; Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.",Sustain Cities Soc,579,29

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients who underwent an HbA1c test. Their demographic data, medical history, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, laboratory test results, and final outcomes of COVID-19 treatment were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients were included and divided into three groups based on their blood glucose status. There were significant differences in SaO(2), serum ferritin level, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen (Fbg) level, and IL6 level among the three groups. A pairwise comparison of the groups showed that groups B and C were significantly different from group A in terms of CRP, ESR, and Fbg, IL6, and serum ferritin levels (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that there was a linear negative correlation between SaO(2) and HbA1c (r = −0.22, P = 0.01), while there was a linear positive correlation between serum ferritin, CRP, Fbg, and ESR levels and HbA1c (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High HbA1c level is associated with inflammation, hypercoagulability, and low SaO(2) in COVID-19 patients, and the mortality rate (27.7%) is higher in patients with diabetes. Determining HbA1c level after hospital admission is thus helpful assessing inflammation, hypercoagulability, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Zhenzhou; Du, Zhe; Zhu, Fengxue",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,579,26

Diabetes is a risk factor for severity and mortality of COVID-19. Recent studies support that COVID-19 has effects beyond the respiratory tract, with vascular complications arising as relevant factors worsening its prognosis, then making patients with previous vascular disease more prone to severity or fatal outcome. Angiotensin-II converting enzime-2 (ACE2) has been proposed as preferred receptor for SARS-CoV-2 host infection, yet specific proteins participating in the virus entry are not fully known. SARS-CoV-2 might use other co-receptor or auxiliary proteins allowing virus infection. In silico experiments proposed that SARS-CoV-2 might bind dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4/CD26), which was established previously as receptor for MERS-CoV. The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) component ACE2 and DPP4 are proteins dysregulated in diabetes. Imbalance of the RAAS and direct effect of soluble DPP4 exert deleterious vascular effects. We hypothesize that diabetic patients might be more affected by COVID-19 due to increased presence ACE2 and DPP4 mediating infection and contributing to a compromised vasculature. Here, we discuss the role of ACE2 and DPP4 as relevant factors linking the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19 in diabetic patients and present an outlook on therapeutic potential of current drugs targeted against RAAS and DPP4 to treat or prevent COVID-19-derived vascular complications.

Moreover, it is discussed how real-world data and trials with IL-6 signaling blockade will be crucial in informing the development of new treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia. Given physiological roles of IL-6 in inflammatory conditions and the data from real world, IL-6 signal inhibitors, along with standard of care (SOC) treatment, might provide efficacy, offering the potential to treat COVID-19 in hospitalized populations more effectively than current SOC alone. Therefore, on-going and planned randomized placebo-controlled studies in combination with SOC and other therapeutics to assess safety and efficacy of IL-6 signal inhibitors in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia will be warranted to address the high unmet need and burden of disease in this severely ill population.","Hashizume, Misato",Inflamm Regen,579,1

Thus, development of natural inhibitors as a prophylactic measure is an attractive strategy. In this context, this work explored phytochemicals as potential inhibitors for SARS‐CoV‐2 by performing all atom molecular dynamics simulations using high performance computing for 8 rationally screened phytochemicals from Withania somnifera and Azadirachta indica and two repurposed drugs docked with the spike glycoprotein and the main protease of SARS‐CoV‐2. These phytochemicals were rationally screened from 55 Indian medicinal plants in our previous work. MM/PBSA, principal component analysis (PCA), dynamic cross correlation matrix (DCCM) plots and biological pathway enrichment analysis were performed to reveal the therapeutic efficacy of these phytochemicals. The results revealed that Withanolide R (−141.96 KJ/mol) and 2,3‐Dihydrowithaferin A (−87.60 KJ/mol) were with the lowest relative free energy of binding for main protease and the spike proteins respectively. It was also observed that the phytochemicals exhibit a remarkable multipotency with the ability to modulate various human biological pathways especially pathways in cancer. Conclusively we suggest that these compounds need further detailed in vivo experimental evaluation and clinical validation to implement them as potent therapeutic agents for combating SARS‐CoV‐2.","Parida, Pratap Kumar; Paul, Dipak; Chakravorty, Debamitra",Phytother Res,579,17

METHODS: Medical charts and images of six patients affected by stroke while being on ACE-Is and ARBs therapy before and during COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy region, Italy, were reviewed. RESULTS: Three patients had a dural sinus thrombosis, whereas the remaining suffered by an arterial ischemia, which was a middle cerebral artery occlusion in one case, and a posterior-inferior cerebellar artery occlusion in the remaining two. All patients showed clinical features typical of SARS-CoV-2 infection and positive chest CT scan, and were treated with ACE-Is as needed. Hypercoagulability panel was negative in any case. A recovery was achieved in all cases, although in a variable manner. CONCLUSIONS: Whether or not and in which manner the pharmacomodulation of the renin-angiotensin system may had affect the clinical course of the reported six COVID-19 patients affected by stroke has to be still clarified.

The cell line was isolated from the dorsal fin, named as rabbit fish fin (RFF) cell line, and which was sub-cultured for 50 cycles since the development. This cell line was tested for growth in different temperatures and serum concentrations, and the best growing condition was at 20% serum at 28 °C. In cultured RFF cells, amplification of 18S rRNA from genomic DNA and immunostaining of cellular cytokeratin confirmed the proper identity of S. fuscescens fish. After 30th passage of cultures, the cells were exposed to challenge of inflammation, triggered by LPS, and hypoxia, mimicked by CoCl(2). Cultured RFF cells showed robust sensitive responses to inflammation and hypoxia in directing the expressions of cytokines and hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). The water extract of aerial part of Scutellaria baicalensis (SBA) has been shown in rabbit fish to prevent inflammation. Here, we extended this notion of testing the efficacy of SBA extract in the developed cultured RFF cells. Application of SBA extract inhibited the expression of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines, i.e. IL-1β, IL-6, as well as the signaling of NF-κB. The application of CoCl(2) in cultured RFF cells triggered the hypoxia-induced cell death and up regulation of HIF-1α. As expected, applied SBA extract in the cultures prevented the hypoxia-induced signaling. Our results show the established RFF cell line may be served as an ideal in vitro model in drug screening relating to inflammation and hypoxia. Additionally, we are supporting the usage of SBA herbal extract in fish aquaculture, which possesses efficacy against inflammation and hypoxia.","Xia, Yi-Teng; Hu, Wei-Hui; Wu, Qi-Yun; Ting-Xia Dong, Tina; Duan, Ran; Xiao, Jian; Li, Shao-ping; Qin, Qi-Wei; Wang, Wen-Xiong; Wah-Keung Tsim, Karl",Fish Shellfish Immunol,579,30

Each Aroclor was assessed at multiple dietary concentrations, ranging from 25 to 200 ppm, for 24 months in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Liver toxicity was indicated by elevated serum enzyme activity (AST, ALT, and GGT), elevated serum cholesterol concentration, decreases in hematologic parameters (RBC, Hb, and Hct), hepatocellular hypertrophy, an increased incidence of altered hepatocellular foci, and an increased incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms (primarily adenomas). Liver toxicity was distinctly more severe in females than in males. The incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms was highly sex-dependent (females > males), differed between Aroclor mixtures and, for females, increased with dose and followed the general incidence pattern of Aroclor 1254 > Aroclor 1260 ≈ Aroclor 1242 > Aroclor 1016. A significant response (p < 0.05) in males was seen only for the high dose of Aroclor 1260. A small increase in the incidence of thyroid gland follicular cell adenomas was noted in males for Aroclors 1242, 1254, and 1260, with the incidence being uniform across dose groups and Aroclor mixtures.

This research examines the relationship between intrinsic reading motivation (IRM) and reading habits in an adult population considering types of reading (for leisure, work/study, social networks, and news), gender, and distress generated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Participants were 3,849 adults from Spain who were surveyed about their reading practices: before, during the first weeks, and after several weeks of confinement. Linear mixed effects models (LMMs) were used to analyze data. Results showed a three-way interaction between reading frequency, IRM, and type of reading. Also, distress seems to pose a differential impact depending on the type of reading. The higher the IRM, the lesser the time devoted to study/work reading and the more to social and news reading (at the beginning of confinement). In this sense, IRM can function as a protective factor of reading behavior but only for leisure reading. Results support previous findings of the importance of consciously promoting this type of motivation in all individuals beyond educational contexts, since it seems to be positively related to well-being. Other results and implications are discussed.","De Sixte, Raquel; Fajardo, Inmaculada; Mañá, Amelia; Jáñez, Álvaro; Ramos, Marta; García-Serrano, María; Natalizi, Federica; Arfé, Barbara; Rosales, Javier",Front Psychol,579,16

The quality and acceptability of self-collected nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) is unknown. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to assess the acceptability of self-collected NPS among HCW. Design: Cross-sectional convenience sample enrolled between April 20th and June 24th, 2020. We had >95% power to detect at least one positive test if the true underlying prevalence of SARS-CoV2 was > 1%. Setting: The metropolitan area surrounding Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. Participants: HCW free of self-reported upper respiratory symptoms were recruited. Exposures: Participants completed questionnaires regarding demographics, household characteristics, personal protective equipment (PPE) utilization and comorbidities. Outcomes: A participant self-collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) was obtained. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed via polymerase chain reaction. NPS discomfort was assessed on a scale of 1 (no discomfort) - 10 (extreme discomfort). NPS duration and depth into the nasopharynx, and willingness to perform future self-collections were assessed. Results: Among n=489 participants 80% were female and mean age+/-SD was 41+/-11. Participants reported being physicians (14%), nurse practitioners (8%), physicians assistants (4%), nurses (51%), medics (3%), or other which predominantly included laboratory technicians and administrative roles (22%). Exposure to a known/suspected COVID-19 case in the 14 days prior to enrollment was reported in 40% of participants. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any participant. The mean+/-SD discomfort level of the NPS was 4.5+/-2.0. 95% of participants reported that their self-swab was longer than or equal to the duration of patient swabs they had previously performed, and 89% reported the depth to be deeper than or equal to the depth of previous patient swabs. Over 95% of participants reported a willingness to repeat a self-collected NP swab in the future. Conclusions and Relevance: The point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was likely very low in symptom-free Minnesota healthcare workers from April 20th and June 24th, 2020. Self-collected NP swabs are well-tolerated and a viable alternative to provider-collected swabs to preserve PPE.","Demmer, R.

This study aimed to describe secondary cases of MERS-CoV infection among healthcare workers and to identify risk factors for death. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on epidemiological data of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to the World Health Organization from September 2012 to 2 June 2018. We compared all secondary cases among healthcare workers with secondary cases among non-healthcare workers. Multivariable logistic regression identified risk factors for death. RESULTS: Of the 2223 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO, 415 were healthcare workers and 1783 were non-healthcare workers. Compared with non-healthcare workers cases, healthcare workers cases were younger (P < 0.001), more likely to be female (P < 0.001), non-nationals (P < 0.001) and asymptomatic (P < 0.001), and have fewer comorbidities (P < 0.001) and higher rates of survival (P < 0.001). Year of infection (2013–2018) and having no comorbidities were independent protective factors against death among secondary healthcare workers cases. CONCLUSION: Being able to protect healthcare workers from high threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV is important for being able to reduce secondary transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare-associated outbreaks.

However, recently it has become clear that also antibodies and pentraxins, which can both activate Fc receptors (FcRs), induce very powerful inflammatory responses by macrophages that can even be an order of magnitude greater than PRRs. While the physiological function of this antibody-dependent inflammation (ADI) is to counteract infections, undesired activation or over-activation of this mechanism will lead to pathology, as observed in a variety of disorders, including viral infections such as COVID-19, chronic inflammatory disorders such as Crohn’s disease, and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Though SARS-CoV-2 spreads mainly via the droplets of respiratory secretions, it was also detected in stool samples of patients, indicating active infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage samples was reported in February 2020, raising the possibility of using environmental water surveillance to monitor SARS-CoV-2 activity in infected areas. The aim of this study was to standardize the methodology for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from sewage and explore the feasibility of establishing supplementary surveillance for COVID-19. METHODS: Sewage specimens were collected from six sites in Mumbai, India, using the grab sample method and processed using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-dextran phase separation method for virus concentration. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: A total of 20 sewage samples collected from six different wards in Mumbai city, before the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections and during May 11-22, 2020, were processed using the phase separation method. The WHO two-phase PEG-dextran method was modified during standardization. SARS-CoV-2 was found to concentrate in the middle phase only. All samples collected before March 16, 2020 were SARS-CoV-2 negative. Viral RNA was detected in sewage samples collected during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in all the six wards. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: PEG-dextran phase separation method was effectively used to concentrate SARS-CoV-2 from domestic waste waters to detection levels. It would be feasible to initiate sewage surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 to generate data about the viral transmission in various epidemiologic settings.","Sharma, Deepa Kailash; Nalavade, Uma Prajwal; Kalgutkar, Kamlesh; Gupta, Nivedita; Deshpande, Jagadish Mohanrao",Indian J Med Res,579,1

Vaccinating children against COVID-19 would contribute to the control of the pandemic and the recovery of the global economy. For children under the age of 18 years, parents are usually the decision makers regarding their children’s vaccination. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate parental acceptability of free COVID-19 vaccination for children under the age of 18 years in China. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, closed online survey among 2053 factory workers in Shenzhen, China, implemented from September 1 to 7, 2020. Participants of the online survey were full-time employees aged 18 years or over who had resumed work in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive physical examinations once a year. Eligible workers attending six designated physical examination sites were invited to complete an online survey. This study was based on a subsample of those who had at least one child under the age of 18 years (N=1052). After being briefed that COVID-19 vaccines developed by China are likely to be available by the end of 2020, participants were asked about their likelihood of having their children under the age of 18 years take up free COVID-19 vaccination provided by the government, if it existed. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to examine the associations of perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and exposure to information related to COVID-19 through social media with parental acceptability, after controlling for significant background characteristics. RESULTS: The prevalence of parents’ acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children was 72.6% (764/1052). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.70, 95% CI 1.50-1.91), the perception that a family member would support them in having their children take up COVID-19 vaccination (ie, perceived subjective norm) (AOR 4.18, 95% CI 3.21-5.43), and perceived behavioral control to have the children take up COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.49-2.26) were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Regarding social media influence, higher exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.17-1.56). Higher exposure to negative information related to COVID-19 vaccination was negatively associated with the dependent variable (AOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Parents’ acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children under 18 years of age was high in China. The TPB is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination targeting parents. Transparency in communicating about the vaccine development process and vaccine safety testing is important. Public health authorities should also address misinformation in a timely manner.","Zhang, Ke Chun; Fang, Yuan; Cao, He; Chen, Hongbiao; Hu, Tian; Chen, Ya Qi; Zhou, Xiaofeng; Wang, Zixin",JMIR Pediatr Parent,579,33

Throughout evolution, animal species have been continually afflicted with devastating disease outbreaks which have influenced the demographic and genetic status of the populations. Some general population consequences of such epidemics include selection for disease resistance, the occasional alteration of host gene frequencies by a genetic ‘founder effect’ after an outbreak, and genetic adaptation of parasites to abrogate host defense mechanisms. A wide variety of host cellular genes which are polymorphic within species and which confer a regulatory effect on the outcome of infectious diseases has recently been discovered. The critical importance of maintaining genetic diversity with respect to disease defense genes in natural populations is indicated by certain populations which have reduced genetic variability and apparent increased vulnerability to infectious disease.","O'Brien, Stephen J.; Evermann, James F.",Trends in Ecology & Evolution,579,22

We report the absolute excess risk (AER) of mortality and excess mortality rate (EMR) from a nationally representative COVID-19 sentinel surveillance network including known COVID-19 risk factors in people aged 45 years and above. METHODS: Pseudonymised, coded clinical data were uploaded from contributing primary care providers (N=1,970,314, ≥45years). We calculated the AER in mortality by comparing mortality for weeks 2 to 20 this year with mortality data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) from 2018 for the same weeks. We conducted univariate and multivariate analysis including preselected variables. We report AER and EMR, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: The AER of mortality was 197•8/10,000 person years (95%CI:194•30-201•40) . The EMR for male gender, compared with female, was 1.4 (95%CI:1•35-1•44, p<0•00); for our oldest age band (≥75 years) 10•09 (95%CI:9•46-10•75, p<0•00) compared to 45-64 year olds; Black ethnicity's EMR was 1.17 (95%CI: 1•03-1•33, p<0•02), reference white; and for dwellings with ≥9 occupants 8•01 (95%CI: 9•46-10•75, p<0•00). Presence of all included comorbidities significantly increased EMR. Ranked from lowest to highest these were: hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic respiratory and heart disease, and cancer or immunocompromised. CONCLUSIONS: The absolute excess mortality was approximately 2 deaths per 100 person years in the first wave of COVID-19. More personalised shielding advice for any second wave should include ethnicity, comorbidity and household size as predictors of risk.","de Lusignan, Simon; Joy, Mark; Oke, Jason; McGagh, Dylan; Nicholson, Brian; Sheppard, James; Akinyemi, Oluwafunmi; Amirthalingam, Gayatri; Brown, Kevin; Byford, Rachel; Dabrera, Gavin; Krajenbrink, Else; Liyanage, Harshana; LopezBernal, Jamie; Okusi, Cecilia; Ramsay, Mary; Sherlock, Julian; Sinnathamby, Mary; Tsang, Ruby S.M.; Brown, Victoria Tzortziou; Williams, John; Zambon, Maria; Ferreira, Filipa; Howsam, Gary; Hobbs, Richard",J Infect,579,16

The ultimate approach to end the pandemic is the timely application of vaccines to achieve herd immunity. Here, a novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) homodimer was developed as a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. Formulated with aluminum adjuvant, RBD dimer elicited strong immune response in both rodents and non-human primates, and protected mice from SARS-CoV-2 challenge with significantly reducing viral load and alleviating pathological injury in the lung. In the non-human primates, the vaccine could prevent majority of the animals from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory tract and reduce lung damage. In addition, antibodies elicited by this vaccine candidate showed cross-neutralization activities to SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, with our expression system, we provided a high-yield RBD homodimer vaccine without additional biosafety or special transport device supports.

Global vaccination coverage has dramatically improved and mortality rates among children due to vaccine-preventable diseases have been significantly reduced since the creation of the Expanded Programme of Immunization in 1974, the formation of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, in 2000, and the development of the Global Vaccine Action Plan in 2012. However, challenges remain and persisting inequities in vaccine uptake contribute to the continued occurrence and outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Inequalities in immunization coverage by geography, urban-rural, and socio-economic status jeopardize the achievement of global immunization goals and call for renewed immunization strategies. These should take into account emerging opportunities for building better immunization systems and services, as well as the development of new vaccine products and delivery technologies. Such strategies need to achieve equity in vaccination coverage across and within countries. This will require the participation of communities, a better understanding of vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, the expansion of vaccination across the life course, approaches to improve immunization in middle-income countries, enhanced use of data and possible financial and non-financial incentives. Vaccines also have an important role to play in comprehensive disease control, including the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Lessons learned from disease eradication and elimination efforts of polio, measles and maternal and neonatal tetanus are instrumental in further enhancing global immunization strategies in line with the revised goals and targets of the new Immunization Agenda 2030, which is currently being developed.","Mantel, Carsten; Cherian, Thomas",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,579,3

This study aimed to study the impact of this national lockdown on the volume and the nature of injuries in patients admitted during this period at a major trauma center in central India. METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive study of prospectively collected data which were collected from the hospital records. Patients admitted to the trauma center during lockdown were compared to patients admitted in the prelockdown period for the change in volume and spectrum and severity of injuries across all age groups and both genders. RESULTS: There was a significant fall in the overall number of trauma patients across all age groups and both genders during the lockdown period (66.8%). There was a significant decrease in numbers among males (68.1%). Road traffic accidents decreased by 75.2%. There was a relative increase in trauma due to falls and assault during the lockdown period. The mortality due to trauma decreased significantly by 79.8%. CONCLUSIONS: There has been an overall decrease in the number of patients admitted to the trauma center during the lockdown period. However, there is a relative increase in preventable injuries such as falls, assault, and animal-related injuries. Focused strategies to decrease preventable injuries need to be devised to reduce the load on overburdened resources during the COVID-19 crisis.","Quraishi, Abdul Haque M.; Sahu, Shiv; Tongse, Pankaj; Agrawal, Ankit",Int J Crit Illn Inj Sci,579,17

In plants, this includes RNA silencing. To uncover additional bottlenecks to RNA virus infection, we genetically attenuated the impact of RNA silencing on transgenically expressed Potato virus X (PVX), a (+)strand RNA virus that replicates in Arabidopsis. A genetic screen in this sensitized background uncovered how nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), a host RNA quality control mechanism, recognizes and eliminates PVX RNAs with internal termination codons and long 3′ UTRs. NMD also operates in natural infection contexts, and while some viruses have evolved genome expression strategies to overcome this process altogether, the virulence of NMD-activating viruses entails their ability to directly suppress NMD or to promote an NMD-unfavorable cellular state. These principles of induction, evasion, and suppression define NMD as a general viral restriction mechanism in plants that also likely operates in animals.","Garcia, Damien; Garcia, Shahinez; Voinnet, Olivier",Cell Host Microbe,579,5

This revolution does not only impact how we communicate, but it affects the nature of the partners with whom we communicate. Online discussion platforms now allow humans to communicate with artificial agents in the form of socialbots. Such agents have the potential to moderate online discussions and even manipulate and alter public opinions. In this paper, we propose to study this phenomenon using a constructed large-scale agent platform. At the heart of the platform lies an artificial agent that can moderate online discussions using argumentative messages. We investigate the influence of the agent on the evolution of an online debate involving human participants. The agent will dynamically react to their messages by moderating, supporting, or attacking their stances. We conducted two experiments to evaluate the platform while looking at the effects of the conversational agent. The first experiment is a large-scale discussion with 1076 citizens from Afghanistan discussing urban policy-making in the city of Kabul. The goal of the experiment was to increase the citizen involvement in implementing Sustainable Development Goals. The second experiment is a small-scale debate between a group of 16 students about globalisation and taxation in Myanmar. In the first experiment, we found that the agent improved the responsiveness of the participants and increased the number of identified ideas and issues. In the second experiment, we found that the agent polarised the debate by reinforcing the initial stances of the participant.","Hadfi, Rafik; Haqbeen, Jawad; Sahab, Sofia; Ito, Takayuki",J Syst Sci Syst Eng,579,2

HATS leverages the apparent complementarity and similarity of physical and mental pandemics using adversarial learning and transduction to promote immunity on both using conformal prediction and principled symbiosis. As such, HATS confronts both mental and physical adversity found in misinformation and disinformation. It confers herd immunity using holism and triangulation that call to advantage on sensitivity analysis using open set transduction and meta-reasoning. Ambient intelligence and stigmergy further mediate meta-reasoning and re-identification in building and sharing immunity. As change is constant and everything is fluid, as truth is not always reality and reality is not always truth, and as truth is imponderable and lie can become truth, two things have to happen. First, reconditioning and reconfiguration engage random deficiency to discern familiarity from strangeness and a-typicality. Second, transfer learning using trans-adaptation and transposition, serve adaptation and interoperability. Together, this empowers open set transduction in facing adaptive persistent threats such as deception and denial when it engages moving target defense using modification and de-identification.

Standard measures of the situation provided by the governments include reported positive cases and total deaths. While total deaths immediately indicate that countries like Italy and Spain have the worst situation as of mid April 2020, on its own, reported cases do not provide a correct picture of the situation. The reason is that different countries diagnose diversely and present very distinctive reported case fatality rate (CFR). The same levels of reported incidence and mortality might hide a very different underlying picture. Here we present a straightforward and robust estimation of the diagnostic rate in each European country. From that estimation we obtain an uniform unbiased incidence of the epidemic. The method to obtain the diagnostic rate is transparent and empiric. The key assumption of the method is that the real CFR in Europe of COVID-19 is not strongly country-dependent. We show that this number is not expected to be biased due to demography nor the way total deaths are reported. The estimation protocol has a dynamic nature, and it has been giving converging numbers for diagnostic rates in all European countries as of mid April 2020. From this diagnostic rate, policy makers can obtain an Effective Potential Growth (EPG) updated everyday providing an unbiased assessment of the countries with more potential to have an uncontrolled situation. The method developed will be used to track possible improvements on the diagnostic rate in European countries as the epidemic evolves.","Catala, M.; Pino, D.; Marchena, M.; Palacios, P.; Urdiales, T.; Cardona, P.-J.; Alonso, S.; Lopez-Codina, D.; Prats, C.; Alvarez Lacalle, E.",,579,8

The research team has encountered a number of challenges related to the “real-world” study setting since the trial began. Using an implementation science lens, we sought to identify and describe barriers impacting both the intervention and research protocols of the POINT study, which are often intertwined in pragmatic trials due to the focus on external validity. METHOD: Qualitative data were collected from 3 peer recovery coaches, 2 peer recovery coach supervisors, and 3 members of the research team. Questions and deductive qualitative analysis were guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). RESULTS: Nine unique barriers were noted, with 5 of these barriers impacting intervention and research protocol implementation simultaneously. These simultaneous barriers were timing of intervention delivery, ineffective communication with emergency department staff, lack of privacy in the emergency department, the fast-paced emergency department setting, and patient’s limited resources. Together, these barriers represent the intervention characteristics, inner setting, and outer setting domains of the CFIR. CONCLUSION: Results highlight the utility of employing an implementation science framework to assess implementation issues in pragmatic trials and how this approach might be used as a quality assurance mechanism given the considerable overlap that exists between research and intervention protocols in real-world trial settings. Previously undocumented changes to the trial design that have been made as a result of the identified barriers are discussed.","Dir, Allyson L.; Watson, Dennis P.; Zhiss, Matthew; Taylor, Lisa; Bray, Bethany C.; McGuire, Alan",Trials,579,1

An important issue is to determine whether this spatial pattern is a consequence of environmental heterogeneities, such as the climatic conditions, during the course of the outbreak. Another fundamental issue is to understand the spatial spreading of COVID-19. To address these questions, we consider four candidate epidemiological models with varying complexity in terms of initial conditions, contact rates and non-local transmissions, and we fit them to French mortality data with a mixed probabilistic-ODE approach. Using standard statistical criteria, we select the model with non-local transmission corresponding to a diffusion on the graph of counties that depends on the geographic proximity, with time-dependent contact rate and spatially constant parameters. This original spatially parsimonious model suggests that in a geographically middle size centralized country such as France, once the epidemic is established, the effect of global processes such as restriction policies, sanitary measures and social distancing overwhelms the effect of local factors. Additionally, this modeling approach reveals the latent epidemiological dynamics including the local level of immunity, and allows us to evaluate the role of non-local interactions on the future spread of the disease. In view of its theoretical and numerical simplicity and its ability to accurately track the COVID-19 epidemic curves, the framework we develop here, in particular the non-local model and the associated estimation procedure, is of general interest in studying spatial dynamics of epidemics.","Roques, L.; Bonnefon, O.; Baudrot, V.; Soubeyrand, S.; Berestycki, H.",,579,32

Designed experiments are conducted to verify the effects of testing and contact tracing on the peak number of infections. It has been observed that testing combined with contact tracing may lower the peak infections to a great extent, and it can thus be avoided for the hospital bed capacity to be overwhelmed by infected patients.

Primary outcome variables were quantitative Spike total antibody levels (U/ml) and seropositivity to Spike (>=0.8 U/ml), as per the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay. Samples seropositive for Nucleocapsid, and samples taken prior to vaccination, were excluded. Outcomes were analysed by days since vaccination, vaccine type (BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1), and a range of self-reported demographic and clinical factors. Results 8,517 vaccinated participants (median age 65 years [IQR: 58, 71]), contributed 13,232 samples (8,115 following ChAdOx1, 5,008 following BNT162b2). Seropositivity to Spike was 96.42% (95%CI 96, 96.79) at 28-34 days following a single dose, reaching 99.08% (97.8, 99.62) at 7-14 days after a second dose. Seropositivity rates, and Spike-antibody levels rose more quickly following the first dose of BNT162b2, however, were equivalent for both vaccines by 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. There was evidence of lower S-antibody levels with increasing age (p=0.0001). In partially vaccinated 65-79 year-olds, lower S-antibody levels were observed in men (25.9 vs 42.3 U/ml, p<0.0001), those with a chronic condition (33.0 vs 41.2 U/ml, p<0.0001), diabetes (22.32 vs 36.01 U/ml, p<0.0001), cardiovascular disease (32.1 vs 36.7 U/ml, p=0.0002), or history of cancer (30.1 vs 35.7 U/ml, p=0.0001), particularly those with haematological rather than solid organ cancer (7.48 vs 31.68 U/ml, p<0.0001), and those currently on immunosuppressive therapy (21.7 vs 35.6 U/ml, p<0.0001). Following a second dose, high S-antibody titres (>=250U/ml) were observed for nearly all individuals. Interpretation A single dose of either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 leads to high Spike seropositivity rates in SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals. However, observed disparities in antibody levels after the first dose by vaccine type, age, and comorbidities highlight the importance of ongoing non-pharmaceutical preventative measures such as social distancing, for partially vaccinated adults, particularly those who are older and more clinically vulnerable.","Shrotri, M.; Fragaszy, E.; Geismar, C.; Nguyen, V.; Beale, S.; Braithwaite, I.; Byrne, T.

Considering that older adults are at high risk for COVID-related medical complications and mortality, the present study focuses on the age-related differences on the adoption of protective behaviors during the initial stages of this outbreak, while accounting for the role of sociodemographic, COVID-related, perceived risk, and psychosocial variables (i.e., anxiety, optimism, fear of death, and social isolation) in this relation. The study sample included 1696 participants, aged between 18 and 85 years old, who completed an online survey during the initial stages of the first COVID-19 outbreak in Portugal. Overall, results reveal that the engagement in protective behaviors declines with advancing age and that older adults show a pattern toward lower perceived risk compared with middle-aged adults. Multicategorical mediation analyses show that anxiety, optimism, fear of death, and social isolation significantly mediate age effects on protective behaviors. Specifically, both anxiety and fear of death increase protective behaviors via higher perceived risk in the middle-aged and in the younger groups, respectively. Optimism directly predicts protective behaviors in the middle-aged groups, while social isolation reduces protective behaviors in the younger and older-aged groups. Results are discussed in terms of its implications for public health policies.","Pasion, Rita; Paiva, Tiago O.; Fernandes, Carina; Barbosa, Fernando",Front Psychol,579,30

METHODS: : Retrospective cohort of 326 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 through April 19, 2020. Sociodemographic and hospital course data were collected and analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to examine associations. RESULTS: : Compared with non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), Hispanics were younger (53 years, median age) and had higher rates of Medicaid and less commercial/HMO/PPO coverage (p<0.001). Similarly, in the age sub-grouped multivariate analysis for outcomes, Hispanics ≥65-year-old were 2.66 times more likely to be admitted to ICU (95% CI: 1.07-6.61; p=0.03), and 3.67 times more likely to get intubated (95% CI: 1.29-10.36; p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: : Hospitalized Hispanic patients of ≥65-year-old with COVID-19 were more likely to have higher risk of more severe outcomes (ICU admission and intubation) compared with NHW. Hispanic patient's social determinants of health and underlying medical conditions may explain the heightened risk for severe outcomes. Further studies are necessary to more accurately identify and address health disparities in Hispanics and other vulnerable populations amidst COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Gil, Raul Macias; Touzard-Romo, Francine; Sanchez, Martha C.; Pandita, Aakriti; Kalligeros, Markos; Mylona, Evangelia K.; Shehadeh, Fadi; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",Ann Epidemiol,579,1

Vitamin D has been proposed as a modifiable risk factor that could mitigate COVID-19 health disparities. We investigated the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity using the UK Biobank, a large progressive cohort study of the United Kingdom population. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the ability of vitamin D, socioeconomic deprivation, and other known risk factors to mediate COVID-19 ethnic health disparities. Asian ethnicity is associated with higher COVID-19 susceptibility, compared to the majority White population, and Asian and Black ethnicity are both associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Socioeconomic deprivation mediates all three ethnic disparities and shows the highest overall signal of mediation for any COVID-19 risk factor. Vitamin supplements, including vitamin D, mediate the Asian disparity in COVID-19 susceptibility, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcifediol) levels mediate Asian and Black COVID-19 severity disparities. Several measures of overall health also mediate COVID-19 ethnic disparities, underscoring the importance of comorbidities. Our results support ethnic minorities’ use of vitamin D as both a prophylactic and a supplemental therapeutic for COVID-19.","Mariño-Ramírez, Leonardo; Ahmad, Maria; Rishishwar, Lavanya; Nagar, Shashwat Deepali; Lee, Kara K.; Norris, Emily T.; Jordan, I.

Leveraging the sequence data from more than 140,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we study mutation rates and selective pressures affecting the virus. Understanding the processes and effects of mutation and selection has profound implications for the study of viral evolution, for vaccine design, and for the tracking of viral spread. We highlight and address some common genome sequence analysis pitfalls that can lead to inaccurate inference of mutation rates and selection, such as ignoring skews in the genetic code, not accounting for recurrent mutations, and assuming evolutionary equilibrium. We find that two particular mutation rates, G→U and C→U, are similarly elevated and considerably higher than all other mutation rates, causing the majority of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and are possibly the result of APOBEC and ROS activity. These mutations also tend to occur many times at the same genome positions along the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny (i.e., they are very homoplasic). We observe an effect of genomic context on mutation rates, but the effect of the context is overall limited. While previous studies have suggested selection acting to decrease U content at synonymous sites, we bring forward evidence suggesting the opposite.","De Maio, Nicola; Walker, Conor R.; Turakhia, Yatish; Lanfear, Robert; Corbett-Detig, Russell; Goldman, Nick",bioRxiv,579,26

Under such circumstances, individual activities in social media and other online platforms will increase tremendously resulting in the circulation of information in the community. These pieces of information can be infodemic monikers misleading the community. Thus exploring the trends of public interest in searching COVID 19 related issues and checking information circulating in the public is highly crucial. Objective: This study aimed to explore users' concerns towards coronavirus related online web search and to investigate the extent of infodemic monikers (misinformation) adopted for identifying the virus in the early stage of COVID 19 spread in Ethiopia. Methods: Google Trends was employed in exploring the tendency towards coronavirus related web search activities in Ethiopia from March 13 to May 8, 2020. Keywords of the different names of COVID 19 and health related issues were used to investigate the trends of public interest in searching from Google over time. Relative search volume (RSV), Average peak comparison (APC), and associated graphs were used to compare the trends of online search interests. Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to check for the presence of correlation. Result: During the study period, the top names users adopted to identify the virus in Ethiopia were corona, virus, coronavirus, corona virus, China coronavirus, and COVID 19. In almost all search activities, the users employed infodemic monikers to identify the virus (overall relative search percentage of 99%). Updates related issues (APC=60, 95% CI, 55, 66) were the most commonly trending health related searches on Google followed by mortality (APC=27, 95% CI, 24, 30) and symptoms (APC=55, 95% CI, 50, 60) related issues. The regional comparison showed the highest cumulative peak for the Oromia region (cumulative total RSVs, 536) followed by the Tigray region (cumulative total RSVs, 512) on querying health related information from Google. No significant correlation was detected between COVID 19 cases per region/city and the maximum peaks of health related searches. Conclusion: This study revealed an initial increase in the public interest of COVID 19 related Google search, but this interest was declined over time. Tremendous circulation of infodemic monikers for the identification of the virus was also noticed in the country. The authors recommend for the government and other stakeholders to work immensely to keep the people alert on coronavirus-related issues and to promote the official names of the virus, like COVID 19, SARS CoV 2 in the public to decrease the circulation of misleading and misinformation amid the outbreak.

Our main results show that monetary policy may be used to correct asset mispricing, to control fluctuations in the real business cycle and also to tame credit cycles in the majority of cases. Our results also show that for the majority of cases, in line with conventional wisdom, local currencies appreciate following a positive monetary policy shock. Monetary policy intervention may indeed be successful in contributing to or achieving financial stability.

In this work, for the first time, we report a joint analysis of biomechanical properties of new ultra-anisotropic, self-aligned ceramic nanofibers augmented with two modifications of graphene shells (GAIN scaffolds) and their interaction of three different viral types (influenza virus A, picornavirus (human parechovirus) and potato virus). It was discovered that nano-topology and structure of the graphene layers have a significant implication on mechanical properties of GAIN scaffolds resulting in non-linear behavior. It was demonstrated that the viral adhesion to GAIN scaffolds is likely to be guided by physical cues in dependence on mutual steric factors, as the scaffolds lack common cell membrane proteins and receptors which viruses usually deploy for transfection.

However, determinants of childhood bronchial reactivity, a key feature of asthma, are largely unknown. Aim of this study was to determine how patient characteristics during the first severe virus-induced wheezing episode are associated with pulmonary function at pre-school age. METHODS: Study consisted of 76 children presenting with their first wheezing episode at the ages of 3 to 23 months. At study entry, viral etiology, rhinovirus genome load, atopic and clinical characteristics, and standardized questionnaire were analyzed. At 4-year follow-up visit, impulse oscillometry with exercise challenge was performed. RESULTS: At study entry, the mean age of the children was 12 months (SD 6.0), 57 (75%) were rhinovirus positive and 22 (30%) were sensitized. At follow-up visit four years later, the mean age of the children was 60 months (SD 7.9) and 37 (49%) were using asthma medication regularly (discontinued before testing in 25 [68%] children).

Methods: The online observational study, both prospective and retrospective, conducted with the use of social media for the distribution of an anonymous online questionnaire, was completed from 1 October to 30 October 2020, during the second wave of the pandemic in Europe. The study encompassed a total of 1071 adults from Poland (n = 407), Austria (n = 353) and the United Kingdom (n = 311). Results: The results of this study indicate that the COVID-19 confinement period influenced eating behavior and the level of physical activity in a group of adult residents of Poland, Austria and the United Kingdom. The general shopping frequency decreased, regardless of the place and manner. However, there was an increased interest in online grocery shopping.

The impact of social determinants of health factors on COVID-19-related risk perceptions over time is also not clear. To address these two knowledge gaps, we extracted tweets regarding COVID-19-related risk perceptions and developed index indicators for three dimensions of risk perceptions based on over 297 million geotagged tweets posted by over 3.5 million Twitter users from January to October 2020 in the United States. We also examined correlations between index indicator scores and county-level social determinants of health factors. The three domains of risk perceptions demonstrate different trajectories. Perceived severity kept climbing throughout the whole study period. Perceived susceptibility and negative emotion declined and remained stable at a lower level after peaking on March 11 (WHO named COVID-19 a global pandemic). Attention on risk perceptions was not exactly in accordance with epidemic trends of COVID-19 (cases, deaths). Users from socioeconomically vulnerable counties showed lower attention on perceived severity and susceptibility of COVID-19 than those from wealthier counties. Examination of trends in tweets regarding the multiple domains of risk perceptions throughout stages of the COVID-19 pandemic can help policy makers frame in-time, tailored, and appropriate responses to prevent viral spread and encourage preventive behavior uptake in United States.","Qiao, S.; Li, Z.; Liang, C.; Li, X.; Rudisill, C.

This was a retrospective chart review of hip fracture patients from a suburban academic hospital on Long Island, New York, who presented from March 1 to May 30, 2020. Patient COVID-19 status, demographics, and hospital outcome measures were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using heteroscedastic t tests for quantitative variables and chi-square tests for qualitative variables. There were 82 patients in the 2020 cohort and 111 in the 2019 control group, representing a 29.9% decrease in cases. The 2020 cohort presented to the hospital an average of 2.77 days after injury compared with 1.15 days for the 2019 control group (P=.0976). Patients in the 2020 cohort were more likely to be discharged home than to rehabilitation (P<.0001) and tended to be discharged with oral anticoagulation (P=.0809). There was no increase in 1-, 3-, or 6-month complications or mortality. During the pandemic, fewer patients were admitted with hip fractures, and the time from injury to presentation doubled. Patients were significantly less likely to be discharged to rehabilitation and more were discharged with oral anticoagulants. Overall, there was no increase in complications, and these data indicate that the authors were successfully able to provide high-quality care to hip fracture patients during the pandemic.

We conducted a multicentric cross-sectional survey from 27 June to 31 September 2020. For this survey, we enrolled 3454 voluntary healthcare workers across four participating hospitals, of which 83.4% were female, with a median age of 40.6 years old (31.8–50.3). We serologically screened the employees for SARS-CoV-2, estimated the prevalence of infection, and conducted binomial logistic regression with random effect on participating hospitals to investigate associations. We estimated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at 5.0% (95 CI, 4.3%–5.8%). We found the lowest prevalence in health professional management support (4.3%) staff. Infections were more frequent in young professionals below 30 years old (aOR = 1.59, (95 CI, 1.06–2.37)), including paramedical students and residents (aOR = 3.38, (95 CI, 1.62–7.05)). In this group, SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was up 16.9%. The location of work and patient-facing role were not associated with increased infections. Employees reporting contacts with COVID-19 patients without adequate protective equipment had a higher rate of infection (aOR = 1.66, (95 CI, 1.12–2.44)). Aerosol-generating tasks were associated with a ~1.7-fold rate of infection, regardless of the uptake of FFP2. Those exposed to clusters of infected colleagues (aOR = 1.77, (95 CI, 1.24–2.53)) or intra-familial COVID-19 relatives (aOR = 2.09, (95 CI, 1.15–3.80)) also had a higher likelihood of infection. This report highlights that a sustained availability of personal protective equipment limits the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate to what is measured in the general population. It also pinpoints the need for dedicated hygiene training among young professionals, justifies the systematic eviction of infected personnel, and stresses the need for interventions to increase vaccination coverage among any healthcare workers.","Vitrat, Virginie; Maillard, Alexis; Raybaud, Alain; Wackenheim, Chloé; Chanzy, Bruno; Nguyen, Sophie; Valran, Amélie; Bosch, Alexie; Noret, Marion; Delory, Tristan",Vaccines (Basel),579,10

Although not much was known about the new virus, the first outbreaks in China and Italy showed that potentially a large number of people worldwide could fall critically ill in a short period of time. A shortage of ventilators and intensive care resources was expected in many countries, leading to concerns about restrictions of medical care and preventable deaths. In order to be prepared for this challenging situation, national triage guidance has been developed or adapted from former influenza pandemic guidelines in an increasing number of countries over the past few months. In this article, we provide a comparative analysis of triage recommendations from selected national and international professional societies, including Australia/New Zealand, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Pakistan, South Africa, Switzerland, the United States, and the International Society of Critical Care Medicine. We describe areas of consensus, including the importance of prognosis, patient will, transparency of the decision‐making process, and psychosocial support for staff, as well as the role of justice and benefit maximization as core principles. We then probe areas of disagreement, such as the role of survival versus outcome, long‐term versus short‐term prognosis, the use of age and comorbidities as triage criteria, priority groups and potential tiebreakers such as ‘lottery’ or ‘first come, first served’. Having explored a number of tensions in current guidance, we conclude with a suggestion for framework conditions that are clear, consistent and implementable. This analysis is intended to advance the ongoing debate regarding the fair allocation of limited resources and may be relevant for future policy‐making.","Jöbges, Susanne; Vinay, Rasita; Luyckx, Valerie A.; Biller‐Andorno, Nikola",Bioethics,579,1

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health in Indianapolis in the early weeks of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. PATIENTS: All hospitalized pediatric patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 as of May 4, 2020, were included. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received therapies including hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, tocilizumab, and convalescent serum and were managed according to an institutional algorithm based on evidence available at the time of presentation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 407 children tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 at our hospital, 24 were positive, and 19 required hospitalization. Seven (36.8%) were critically ill in ICU, and four (21%) required mechanical ventilation. Hospitalized children were predominantly male (14, 74%) and African-American or Hispanic (14, 74%), with a bimodal distribution of ages among young children less than or equal to 2 years old (8, 42%) and older adolescents ages 15–18 (6, 32%). Five of seven (71.4%) of critically ill patients were African-American (n = 3) or Hispanic (n = 2). Critical illness was associated with older age (p = 0.017), longer duration of symptoms (p = 0.036), and lower oxygen saturation on presentation (p = 0.016); with more thrombocytopenia (p = 0.015); higher C-reactive protein (p = 0.031); and lower WBC count (p = 0.039). Duration of mechanical ventilation averaged 14.1 days. One patient died. CONCLUSIONS: Severe, protracted coronavirus disease 2019 is seen in pediatric patients, including those without significant comorbidities. We observed a greater proportion of hospitalized children requiring mechanical ventilation than has been reported to date. Older children, African-American or Hispanic children, and males may be at risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 requiring hospitalization. Hypoxia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated C-reactive protein may be useful markers of critical illness. Data regarding optimal management and therapies for pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 are urgently needed.","Bhumbra, Samina; Malin, Stefan; Kirkpatrick, Lindsey; Khaitan, Alka; John, Chandy C.; Rowan, Courtney M.; Enane, Leslie A.",Pediatr Crit Care Med,579,1

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational clinical study METHODS: Among 32,814 patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 2020 and December 2020 in our center, eleven microbiologically confirmed ROM co-infection cases in severe COVID-19 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: There were nine men and two women with a mean age of 73.1 ± 7.7 years. Eight patients had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes with a mean diagnosis duration of 12.1 ± 4.4 years. All patients had COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome and received corticosteroids. The mean time interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and ROM diagnosis was 14.4 ± 4.3 days. Seven patients (63.6%) had orbital apex syndrome, and four patients (36.4%) presented with orbital cellulitis. Endophthalmitis was detected in 54.5% of patients, and two of these patients developed retinoschisis. CT scan/MRI revealed sino-orbital involvement in all patients, and three of these had cerebral involvement at initial presentation. All patients received intravenous and retrobulbar liposomal amphotericin B and had undergone radical debridement of involved sinuses. Intravitreal liposomal amphotericin B injected in patients with endophthalmitis. Despite all measures, 63.6% of patients expired. CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID-19 is associated with a significant incidence of ROM with higher mortality rates due to immune dysregulation and the widespread use of steroids. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of this infection in patients with COVID-19. An aggressive multidisciplinary approach can help to reduce mortality.

Numerous antiviral targets are being investigated, but non-structural protein 13 (nsp13) stands out as a highly conserved and yet under studied target. Nsp13 is a superfamily 1 (SF1) helicase that translocates along and unwinds viral RNA in an ATP dependent manner. Currently, there are no available structures of nsp13 from SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 with either ATP or RNA bound presenting a significant hurdle to the rational design of therapeutics. To address this knowledge gap, we have built models of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 in Apo, ATP, ssRNA and ssRNA+ATP substrate states. Using 30 μs of Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics simulation (at least 6 μs per substrate state), these models were confirmed to maintain substrate binding poses that are similar to other SF1 helicases. A gaussian mixture model and linear discriminant analysis structural clustering protocol was used to identify key aspects of the ATP-dependent RNA translocation mechanism. Namely, four RNA-nsp13 structures are identified that exhibit ATP-dependent populations and support the inch-worm mechanism for translocation. These four states are characterized by different RNA-binding poses for motifs Ia, IV and V and suggest a powerstroke–like motion of domain 2A relative to domain 1A. This structural and mechanistic insight of nsp13 RNA translocation presents novel targets for the further development of antivirals.","Weber, Ryan; McCullagh, Martin",bioRxiv,579,7

In response, clinical staff and resources have been redeployed to the areas of greatest need, that is, intensive care units and emergency rooms (ER), to reinforce front-line manpower. We introduce the concept of close air support (CAS) to augment ER operations in an efficient, safe and scalable manner. Teams of five comprising two on-site junior ER physicians would be paired with two CAS doctors, who would be off-site but be in constant communication via teleconferencing to render real-time administrative support. They would be supervised by an ER attending. This reduces direct viral exposure to doctors, conserves precious personal protective equipment and allows ER physicians to focus on patient care. Medical students can also be involved in a safe and supervised manner. After 1 month, the average time to patient disposition was halved. General feedback was also positive. CAS improves efficiency and is safe, scalable and sustainable. It has also empowered a previously untapped group of junior clinicians to support front-line medical operations, while simultaneously protecting them from viral exposure.

In literature there are not available paediatric studies about the identification of SARS-CoV-2 through nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), but the use of NPA is deemed to be better than NS to identify respiratory viruses in children. The aim of our study is to evaluate diagnostic performances of NS compared to NPA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children. We collected 300 paired samples (NS and NPA) from children hospitalized and followed up in our paediatric unit. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of NS referred to NPA of the whole sample and then, considering both the age ([≥] and < 6 years old) and the period of collection (March vs follow up) as covariates in different analysis. The NS has a low sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in children when referred to NPA; whereas its specificity results high. In children under 6 years of age, our results suggest to prefer the collection of NS, whenever possible. Though statistically not significant, the sensitivity of NS becomes higher if it is performed before NPA.","Di Pietro, G.

PURPOSE: To determine the difference in sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection between nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva and estimate the incremental cost per additional SARS-CoV-2 infection detected with nasopharyngeal swabs. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Medline, medRxiv, and bioRxiv were searched from 1 January to 1 November 2020. Cost inputs were from nationally representative sources in Canada and were converted to 2020 U.S. dollars. STUDY SELECTION: Studies including at least 5 paired nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples and reporting diagnostic accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 detection. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were independently extracted using standardized forms, and study quality was assessed using QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2). DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-seven studies with 7332 paired samples were included. Against a reference standard of a positive result on either sample, the sensitivity of saliva was 3.4 percentage points lower (95% CI, 9.9 percentage points lower to 3.1 percentage points higher) than that of nasopharyngeal swabs. Among persons with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, saliva's sensitivity was 1.5 percentage points higher (CI, 7.3 percentage points lower to 10.3 percentage points higher) than that of nasopharyngeal swabs. Among persons without a previous SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, saliva was 7.9 percentage points less (CI, 14.7 percentage points less to 0.8 percentage point more) sensitive. In this subgroup, if testing 100 000 persons with a SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 1%, nasopharyngeal swabs would detect 79 more (95% uncertainty interval, 5 fewer to 166 more) persons with SARS-CoV-2 than saliva, but with an incremental cost per additional infection detected of $8093. LIMITATION: The reference standard was imperfect, and saliva collection procedures varied. CONCLUSION: Saliva sampling seems to be a similarly sensitive and less costly alternative that could replace nasopharyngeal swabs for collection of clinical samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Therefore, medical students should be confronted with digital health during their medical education. However, corresponding teaching formats and concepts are still largely lacking in the medical curricula. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to introduce digital health as a curricular module at a German medical school and to identify undergraduate medical competencies in digital health and their suitable teaching methods. METHODS: We developed a 3-week curricular module on digital health for third-year medical students at a large German medical school, taking place for the first time in January 2020. Semistructured interviews with 5 digital health experts were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using an abductive approach. We obtained feedback from the participating students and lecturers of the module through a 17-item survey questionnaire. RESULTS: The module received overall positive feedback from both students and lecturers who expressed the need for further digital health education and stated that the field is very important for clinical care and is underrepresented in the current medical curriculum. We extracted a detailed overview of digital health competencies, skills, and knowledge to teach the students from the expert interviews. They also contained suggestions for teaching methods and statements supporting the urgency of the implementation of digital health education in the mandatory curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: An elective class seems to be a suitable format for the timely introduction of digital health education. However, a longitudinal implementation in the mandatory curriculum should be the goal. Beyond training future physicians in digital skills and teaching them digital health’s ethical, legal, and social implications, the experience-based development of a critical digital health mindset with openness to innovation and the ability to assess ever-changing health technologies through a broad transdisciplinary approach to translate research into clinical routine seem more important. Therefore, the teaching of digital health should be as practice-based as possible and involve the educational cooperation of different institutions and academic disciplines.","Poncette, Akira-Sebastian; Glauert, Daniel Leon; Mosch, Lina; Braune, Katarina; Balzer, Felix; Back, David",J Med Internet Res,579,27

We aimed to investigate the effect of different immunosuppressive drugs on antibody development after COVID-19 vaccination in patients with autoimmune diseases. METHODS: In this study, we used serum samples collected from patients with autoimmune diseases and healthy controls who were included in two ongoing prospective cohort studies in the Netherlands. Participants were eligible for inclusion in this substudy if they had been vaccinated with any COVID-19 vaccine via the Dutch national vaccine programme, which at the time was prioritising vaccination of older individuals. Samples were collected after the first or second COVID-19 vaccination. No serial samples were collected. Seroconversion rates and IgG antibody titres against the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured. Logistic and linear regression analyses were used to investigate the association between medication use at the time of vaccination and at least until sampling, seroconversion rates, and IgG antibody titres. The studies from which data were collected are registered on the Netherlands Trial Register, Trial ID NL8513, and ClinicalTrials.org, NCT04498286. FINDINGS: Between April 26, 2020, and March 1, 2021, 3682 patients with rheumatic diseases, 546 patients with multiple sclerosis, and 1147 healthy controls were recruited to participate in the two prospective cohort studies. Samples were collected from patients with autoimmune diseases (n=632) and healthy controls (n=289) after their first (507 patients and 239 controls) or second (125 patients and 50 controls) COVID-19 vaccination. The mean age of both patients and controls was 63 years (SD 11), and 423 (67%) of 632 patients with autoimmune diseases and 195 (67%) of 289 controls were female. Among participants without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroconversion after first vaccination were significantly lower in patients than in controls (210 [49%] of 432 patients vs 154 [73%] of 210 controls; adjusted odds ratio 0·33 [95% CI 0·23–0·48]; p<0·0001), mainly due to lower seroconversion in patients treated with methotrexate or anti-CD20 therapies. After the second vaccination, seroconversion exceeded 80% in all patient treatment subgroups, except among those treated with anti-CD20 therapies (three [43%] of seven patients). We observed no difference in seroconversion and IgG antibody titres between patients with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection who had received a single vaccine dose (72 [96%] of 75 patients, median IgG titre 127 AU/mL [IQR 27–300]) and patients without a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection who had received two vaccine doses (97 [92%] of 106 patients, median IgG titre 49 AU/mL [17–134]). INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that seroconversion after a first COVID-19 vaccination is delayed in older patients on specific immunosuppressive drugs, but that second or repeated exposure to SARS-CoV-2, either via infection or vaccination, improves humoral immunity in patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs. Therefore, delayed second dosing of COVID-19 vaccines should be avoided in patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs. Future studies that include younger patients need to be done to confirm the generalisability of our results.

Preventable adverse events (pAEs) as the counterpart to patient safety are harmful incidents that fell behind health care standards and have led to temporary or permanent harm or death. As safe communication and mutual understanding are of crucial importance for providing a high quality of care under everyday conditions, we aimed to identify barriers and facilitators that impact safe communication in obstetrics from the subjective perspective of health care workers. A qualitative study with 20 semi-structured interviews at two university hospitals in Germany was conducted to explore everyday perceptions from a subjective perspective (subjective theories). Physicians, midwives, and nurses in a wide span of professional experience and positions were enrolled. We identified a structural area of conflict at the professional interface between midwives and physicians. Mandatory interprofessional meetings, acceptance of subjective mistakes, mutual understanding, and debriefings of conflict situations are reported to improve collaboration. Additionally, emergency trainings, trainings in precise communication, and handovers are proposed to reduce risks for pAEs. Furthermore, the participants reported time-constraints and understaffing as a huge burden that hinders safe communication. Concluding, safety culture and organizational management are closely entwined and strategies should address various levels of which communication trainings are promising.","Schmiedhofer, Martina; Derksen, Christina; Keller, Franziska Maria; Dietl, Johanna Elisa; Häussler, Freya; Strametz, Reinhard; Koester-Steinebach, Ilona; Lippke, Sonia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,579,20

No specific drug is currently available for the effective treatment of CSFV infection. RNA interference (RNAi) technology depends on effective delivery systems, for which several effective vectors have recently been developed. Three retroviral plasmids containing siRNA genes targeting different regions of N(pro) and NS4A have been constructed, and 3 replication-incompetent retroviral vectors have been produced in the human embryo kidney cell line GP2-293 by retroviral plasmid transfection. PK-15 cells were then infected with these replication-incompetent retroviral vectors and screened for siRNA stably expressing PK-15 cell clones. Growth of CSFV in such siRNA stably expressing cell clones resulted in a 186-fold reduction in viral genome copies and, at 72 h post-infection, only a small % of cells showed infection by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, and effective inhibition of virus replication persisted for up to 120 h. Retroviral vector-mediated RNAi can therefore be used to study the specific function of viral genes associated with CSFV replication and may have potential therapeutic application.","Li, Jiangnan; Guo, Huancheng; Shi, Zixue; Tu, Changchun",J Virol Methods,579,33

This study investigated the effect of etiology and duration of OL on gray matter volume (GMV) of these regions in 257 patients. Voxel-based morphometry was applied to measure GMV in brain regions of interest to test the effects of etiology and duration on regional GMV and the relation between olfactory function and regional GMV. Etiology of OL had a significant effect on GMV in clusters representing the gyrus rectus and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), bilaterally. Patients with congenital anosmia had reduced GMV in the gyrus rectus and an increased OFC volume compared to patients with acquired OL. There was a significant association between volume of the left OFC and olfactory function. This implies that changes in GMV in patients with acquired OL are mainly reflected in the OFC and depend on olfactory function. Morphology of olfactory areas in the brain therefore seems to relate to olfactory function and the subsequent degree of exposure to olfactory input in patients with acquired OL. Differences in GMV in congenital anosmia are most likely due to the fact that patients were never able to smell.","Postma, E. M.; Smeets, P. A. M.; Boek, W. M.; Boesveldt, S.",Sci Rep,579,21

METHODS: Clinical, laboratory, radiology, and treatment data of 41 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively collected. The population was stratified by disease severity as mild, moderate, or severe, based on guidelines of the National Health and Medical Commission of China. RESULTS: The 41 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were studied, and the median age was 45 years (interquartile range [IQR], 31–53; range, 10–87 years) and 18 patients (43.9%) were female. All of the patients had recently visited Wuhan or other places (ie, Beijing, Thailand) or had Wuhan-related exposure. Common symptoms included fever (32[78%]) and cough (29[70.7%]). All patients were without hepatitis B/C virus hepatitis. CRP (C-reactive protein, 11.3 mg/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 2.45–35.2]) was elevated in 22 patients (53.7%), and cardiac troponin I (1.5 ng/mL [IQR, 0.8–5.0]) was elevated in 41 patients (100%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral ground glass opacity (GGO) or GGO with consolidation in the lungs of 27(65.9%) patients. 31(75.6%) patients had an abnormal electrocardiograph (ECG). Comparing the three groups, the levels of CRP and cardiac troponin I, GGO distribution in bilateral lungs, and electrocardiogram changes were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Cardiac troponin I had a strong positive correlation with CRP (r = 0.704, p = 0.042) and LDH (r = 0.738, p = 0.037). CONCLUSION: Significant differences among the groups suggest that several clinical parameters may serve as biomarkers of COVID-19 severity at hospital admission. Elevated cTnI could be considered as a predictor of severe COVID-19, reflecting the prognosis of patients with severe COVID-19. The results warrant further inspection and confirmation.","Zhang, Qing; Xu, Qian; Chen, Yi-yang; Lou, Li-xin; Che, Li-he; Li, Xiao-hua; Sun, Lu-yao; Bao, Wan-guo; Du, Na",BMC Infect Dis,579,19

To assess the efficacy of ivermectin to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the nasopharyngeal swab on days 4, 7, 14 and 21 post-treatment initiation. 2. To assess the efficacy of ivermectin on the improvement of symptoms. 3. To assess the proportion of seroconversions at day 21. 4. To assess the safety of ivermectin at the proposed dose. 5. To determine the magnitude of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2. 6. To assess correlation of the presence of intestinal helminths on participants on baseline and day 14 with COVID-19 progression and treatment. TRIAL DESIGN: SAINT PERU is a triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with two parallel arms to evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin in negativizing nasopharyngeal PCR in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. PARTICIPANTS: The trial is conducted in two national hospitals in Lima-Peru. The study population is patients with a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal specimen, symptomatic for 96 hours or less, with non-severe COVID-19 disease at baseline, regardless of the presence of risk factors for progression to severity. The study will not include pregnant women or minors (17 years old or younger). : 1. COVID-19 symptomatology (cough, fever, anosmia, etc.) lasting no more than 96 hours, with a positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. 2. 18 years or older. 3. No use of ivermectin in the month prior to the visit. 4. No known history of ivermectin allergy. 5. Capable to give informed consent. 6. Not current use of CYP 3A4 or P-gp inhibitor drugs such as quinidine, amiodarone, diltiazem, spironolactone, verapamil, clarithromycin, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, indinavir, ritonavir, cobicistat or critical CYP3A4 substrate drugs such as warfarin. : 1. COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed by the attending physician (oxygen saturation < 95% or lung examination). 2. Positive pregnancy test for women at childbearing age. 3. Positive IgG against SARS-CoV-2 by rapid diagnostic test at screening. Participants will be recruited by the investigators at the emergency services of the study sites. They are expected to remain in the trial for a period of 21 days. Follow-up visits will be conducted by the trial medical staff at the participant's home or at a hospital in case of hospitalization. Follow-up visits will assess clinical and laboratory parameters of the patients. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Ivermectin (300 mcg/kg) or placebo will be administered in one daily dose for three consecutive days. Currently, there is no solid data on the efficacy of ivermectin against the virus in vivo; therefore the use of placebo in the control group is ethically justified. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary Proportion of patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab at day 7 post-treatment. : 1. Mean viral load as determined by PCR cycle threshold (Ct) on days 4, 7, 14, and 21 2. Proportion of patients with fever and cough at days 4, 7, 14, and 21 as well as proportion of patients progressing to severe disease or death during the trial. 2. Proportion of patients with a positive rapid diagnostic test at day 21. 3. Proportion of drug-related adverse events during the trial. 4. Median levels of IgG, IgM, IgA measured by Luminex. RANDOMIZATION: Participants will be randomized to receive one dose of 300 mcg/kg ivermectin or placebo daily for three consecutive days. The epidemiologist will generate a list of correlative numbers, in randomized blocks of size 4, with the assignment to the treatment groups (a and b). The randomization list will be kept in an encrypted file accessible only to the trial statistician. This list will be handed directly to the pharmacist. Independently, the principal investigator will randomly assign the intervention (ivermectin) to one of the two groups (a or b) by tossing a coin, and will inform the pharmacist of the result of this process. The pharmacist will prepare and label the treatment vials according to the randomization list prepared by the epidemiologist and the treatment assignment given by the principal investigator. Eligible patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio using this randomization list. BLINDING (MASKING): The clinical trial team, the statistician, and the patients will be blinded as to arm allocation. The vials with placebo will be visibly identical to the ones with the active drug. Treatment will be administered by staff not involved in the clinical care or participant’s follow up.

Our institution has treated over 2,000 COVID-19 patients during the pandemic in New York City. The pandemic directly impacts cancer patients and the organization of cancer care. Mount Sinai Hospital has a large and diverse multiple myeloma population. Here, we report the characteristics of COVID-19 infection and serological response in multiple myeloma (MM) patients in a large tertiary care institution in New York. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of a cohort of 58 patients with a plasma cell disorder (54 MM, 4 smoldering MM) who developed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. We report epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics including persistence of viral detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, treatments initiated, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 58 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 36 were hospitalized and 22 were managed at home. The median age was 67 years; 52% of patients were male and 63% were non-white. Hypertension (64%), hyperlipidemia (62%), obesity (37%), diabetes mellitus (28%), chronic kidney disease (CKD, 24%) and lung disease (21%) were the most common comorbidities. In the total cohort, 14 patients (24%) died. Older age (>70 years), male sex and cardiovascular risk were significantly (p<0.05) associated with hospitalization. Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p<0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, non-white race, and mortality. Ninety-six percent (22/23) of patients developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at a median of 32 days after initial diagnosis. Median time to PCR negativity was 43 (range 19-68) days from initial positive PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Drug exposure and MM disease status at the time of contracting COVID-19 had no bearing on patient outcome. Mounting a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, and severe hypogammaglobulinemia were associated with higher mortality. These findings pave a path to identification of vulnerable patients who need early intervention to improve outcome of myeloma patients in future outbreaks of COVID-19.

The objective of this study was to describe the causes and timing of death in patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We performed a retrospective study in eight ICUs across seven French hospitals. All consecutive adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) admitted to the ICU with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute respiratory failure were included in the analysis. The causes and timing of ICU deaths were reported based on medical records. RESULTS: From March 1, 2020, to April 28, 287 patients were admitted to the ICU for SARS-CoV-2 related acute respiratory failure. Among them, 93 patients died in the ICU (32%). COVID-19-related multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was the leading cause of death (37%). Secondary infection-related MODS accounted for 26% of ICU deaths, with a majority of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Refractory hypoxemia/pulmonary fibrosis was responsible for death in 19% of the cases. Fatal ischemic events (venous or arterial) occurred in 13% of the cases. The median time from ICU admission to death was 15 days (25th–75th IQR, 7–27 days).

However, few articles have detailed implementation plans to manage lockdowns and subsequent re-openings. In this article, specific operational responses and their outcomes in a large tertiary ophthalmology centre are described. METHOD: Through a concerted effort led by a dedicated task force, the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) planned and executed an operational transformation to respond to the restrictions imposed on healthcare delivery during a national lock down. A carefully calibrated re-starting of services was carried out with the subsequent phased reopening of the country, taking into consideration unique constraints faced at that time. Strategies for operating in the new normal environment were also developed. RESULTS: Outpatient attendances were safely and expediently reduced by 70% (8749 vs. 29,311) and 82% (5164 vs. 29,342) in April and May 2020, respectively, compared to the corresponding months in 2019. A correspondingly large reduction in surgical load was also achieved through a similar triaging and prioritization system. Through optimizing the center’s use of space and time, as well as expanding on new models of care, a return to pre-pandemic patient load was achieved 3 months into the phased reopening of the country, and subsequently exceeded in the following months. CONCLUSION: The lessons gleaned from SNEC’s experience may be useful for institutions currently facing the same challenges, and for future responses to COVID-19 resurgences or other pandemics.","Lim, Hou Boon; Tan, Tien-En; Fenner, Beau J.; Heah, Jenny; Arundhati, Anshu; Khor, Wei Boon; Boey, Pui Yi; Lee, Shu Yen; Wong, Edmund Y.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is regularly used to determine the local virus production and immune effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the lower respiratory tract. However, the potential interference of those two diagnostic modalities is unknown in non-human primates. The current study investigated the effect and duration of BAL on computed tomography (CT) in both healthy and experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). In addition, the effect of subsequent BALs was reviewed. Thorax CTs and BALs were obtained from four healthy animals and 11 experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. From all animals, CTs were obtained just before BAL, and 24 hours post-BAL. Additionally, from the healthy animals, CTs immediately after, and four hours post-BAL were obtained. Thorax CTs were evaluated for alterations in lung density, measured in Hounsfield units, and a visual semi-quantitative scoring system. An increase in the lung density was observed on the immediately post-BAL CT but resolved within 24 hours in the healthy animals. In the infected animals, a significant difference in both the lung density and CT score was still found 24 hours after BAL. Furthermore, the differences between time points in CT score were increased for the second BAL.

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is extensive, of which critical cases are with rapid disease progression and high mortality. The aim of our study is to summarize the characteristics of different subtypes and explore risk factors of illness severity for early identification and prompt treatment. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we collected data of patients confirmed COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province from 17 January to 12 February 2020. According to the definition of clinical classification, we divided confirmed cases into four types, and summarize epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiograph findings, treatments, and outcomes, respectively. Moreover, we used univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression models to explore risk factors for the severity of illness in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 788 patients were enrolled in our study, of whom 52 cases (6.6%) were mild type, 658 cases (83.5%) were common type, 61 cases (7.2%) were severe type, and 17 cases (2.2%) were critical type. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression demonstrated increasing odds of the severity of illness in patients with COVID-19 associated with male (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2–2.6 P = 0.008), fever (OR = 3.6, 95% CI: 2.1–6.3, P < 0.001), cough (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0–2.9, P = 0.041), hemoptysis (OR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.1–10.3, P = 0.032), gastrointestinal symptoms (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.0–3.5, P = 0.047), hypertension (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.2–5.6, P = 0.013). With the increase of age-grading, risk for the severity of illness was gradually higher (≤ 18 years [OR = 1.0], 19–40 years [OR = 12.7, 95% CI: 4.5–36.0, P < 0.001], 41–65 years [OR = 14.8, 95% CI: 5.2–42.1, P < 0.001], ≥ 66 years [OR = 56.5, 95% CI: 17.1–186.5, P < 0.001]).

Our objective was to systematically review recent literature of reported estimates of the distribution of incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 with the aim of describing the distribution and its variability and dispersion through meta-analysis. Methods A systematic review search was carried out up to January 10, 2021 of all identified references available reporting the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period. Individual mean and standard deviation were used to produce the pooled estimate. Sources of heterogeneity were explored by age, gender and study design using a meta-regression. Results In total, 99 studies were eligible for analysis in our meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of the mean incubation period across the studies was 6.38 days, 95% CI [5.79; 6.97]. Conclusion The mean incubation period will help for identification of time of exposure, but determinants of its variations/range might be explored for potential links with clinical outcome or pathogenic steps at early time of infection.

One activity that many families have incorporated into their routines while at home is virtual storytime, with teachers, grandparents, and other remote adults reading books to children over video chat. The current study asks how dialogic reading over video chat compares to more traditional forms of book reading in promoting story comprehension and vocabulary learning. Fifty-eight 4-year-olds (M(age) = 52.7, SD = 4.04, 31 girls) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (Video chat, Live, and Prerecorded). Across conditions, children were read the same narrative storybook by a female experimenter who used the same 10 scripted dialogic reading prompts during book reading. In the Video chat (n = 21) and Live conditions (n = 18), the experimenter gave the scripted prompts and interacted naturally and contingently, responding in a timely, relevant manner to children’s behaviors. In the Prerecorded condition (n = 19), children viewed a video of an experimenter reading the book. The Prerecorded condition was pseudo-contingent; the reader posed questions and paused for a set period of time as if to wait for a child’s response. After reading, children completed measures of vocabulary and comprehension. Results revealed no differences between conditions across six different outcome measures, suggesting that children comprehended and learned from the story similarly across book formats. Further, children in the three experimental conditions scored significantly higher on measures than children in a fourth condition (control) who had never read the book, confirming that children learned from the three different book formats. However, children were more responsive to the prompts in the Live and Video chat conditions than the Prerecorded condition, suggesting that children recognized that these interactions were contingent with their responses, a feature that was lacking in the Prerecorded condition. Results indicate that children can comprehend books over video chat, suggesting that this technology is a viable option for reading to children, especially during the current pandemic.","Gaudreau, Caroline; King, Yemimah A.; Dore, Rebecca A.; Puttre, Hannah; Nichols, Deborah; Hirsh-Pasek, Kathy; Golinkoff, Roberta Michnick",Front Psychol,579,1

We aim to predict COVID-19 disease course and compare effectiveness of mitigation measures across countries to inform policy decision making. We propose a robust and parsimonious survival-convolution model for predicting key statistics of COVID-19 epidemics (daily new cases). We account for transmission during a pre-symptomatic incubation period and use a time-varying effective reproduction number (R(t)) to reflect the temporal trend of transmission and change in response to a public health intervention. We estimate the intervention effect on reducing the infection rate and quantify uncertainty by permutation. In China and South Korea, we predicted the entire disease epidemic using only data in the early phase (two to three weeks after the outbreak). A fast rate of decline in R(t) was observed and adopting mitigation strategies early in the epidemic was effective in reducing the infection rate in these two countries. The lockdown in Italy did not further accelerate the speed at which the infection rate decreases. The effective reproduction number has staggered around R(t) = 1.0 for more than 2 weeks before decreasing to below 1.0, and the epidemic in Italy is currently under control. In the US, R(t) significantly decreased during a 2-week period after the declaration of national emergency, but afterwards the rate of decrease is substantially slower. If the trend continues after May 1, the first wave of COVID-19 may be controlled by July 26 (CI: July 9 to August 27). However, a loss of temporal effect on infection rate (e.g., due to relaxing mitigation measures after May 1) could lead to a long delay in controlling the epidemic (November 19 with less than 100 daily cases) and a total of more than 2 million cases.","Wang, Qinxia; Xie, Shanghong; Wang, Yuanjia; Zeng, Donglin",medRxiv,579,28

Along with other innate immunity, this nonspecific response would either clear the invading viruses or allow the adaptive immune system to establish an effective antiviral response at late stages of the infection. The objective of this study was to characterize cellular mechanisms exploited by coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) to regulate the induction of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, at the transcriptional level. The results showed that IBV infection of cultured human and animal cells activated the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and induced the expression of IL-6 and IL-8. Meanwhile, IBV has developed a strategy to counteract the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 by inducing the expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), a negative regulator of the p38 MAPK, in order to limit the production of an excessive amount of IL-6 and IL-8 in the infected cells. As activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and induction of IL-6 and IL-8 may have multiple pathogenic effects on the whole host as well as on individual infected cells, regulation of the p38 MAPK and DUSP1 feedback loop by IBV may modulate the pathogenesis of the virus.","Liao, Ying; Wang, Xiaoxing; Huang, Mei; Tam, James P.; Liu, Ding Xiang",Virology,579,1

In order to permit the monitoring of the evolution of this number, a new estimation procedure is proposed here, assuming a well-accepted model for current incidence data, based on past observations. The novelty of the proposed approach is twofold: 1) the estimation of the reproduction number is achieved by convex optimization within a proximal-based inverse problem formulation, with constraints aimed at promoting piecewise smoothness; 2) the approach is developed in a multivariate setting, allowing for the simultaneous handling of multiple time series attached to different geographical regions, together with a spatial (graph-based) regularization of their evolutions in time. The effectiveness of the approach is first supported by simulations, and two main applications to real COVID-19 data are then discussed. The first one refers to the comparative evolution of the reproduction number for a number of countries, while the second one focuses on French departments and their joint analysis, leading to dynamic maps revealing the temporal co-evolution of their reproduction numbers.","Abry, Patrice; Pustelnik, Nelly; Roux, Stéphane; Jensen, Pablo; Flandrin, Patrick; Gribonval, Rémi; Lucas, Charles-Gérard; Guichard, Éric; Borgnat, Pierre; Garnier, Nicolas",PLoS One,579,1

Management of the pandemic will rely heavily on the degree of adaptive immunity persistence following natural SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Along with the progression of the pandemic, more literature on the persistence of the SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific antibody response is becoming available. Here, we summarize findings on the persistence of the humoral, including neutralizing antibody, response at three to eight months post SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in non‐pregnant adults. While the comparability of the literature is limited, findings on the detectability of immunoglobulin G class of antibodies (IgG) were most consistent and were reported in most studies to last for six to eight months. Studies investigating the response of immunoglobins M and A (IgM, IgA) were limited and reported mixed results, in particular, for IgM. The majority of studies observed neutralizing antibodies at all time points tested, which in some studies lasted up to eight months. The presence of neutralizing antibodies has been linked to protection from re‐infection, suggesting long‐term immunity to SARS‐CoV‐2. These neutralizing capacities may be challenged by emerging virus variants, but mucosal antibodies as well as memory B and T cells may optimize future immune responses. Thus, further longitudinal investigation of PCR‐confirmed seropositive individuals using sensitive assays is warranted to elucidate the nature and duration of a more long‐term humoral response.","Knies, Andrea; Ladage, Dennis; Braun, Ralf J.; Kimpel, Janine; Schneider, Miriam",Rev Med Virol,579,1

We applied high-throughput genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 to 75% of cases in the State of Victoria (population 6.24 million) in Australia. METHODS: Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected through active case finding and contact tracing. A dedicated SARS-CoV-2 multidisciplinary genomic response team was formed to enable rapid integration of epidemiological and genomic data. Phylodynamic analysis was performed to assess the putative impact of social restrictions. RESULTS: Between 25 January and 14 April 2020, 1,333 COVID-19 cases were reported in Victoria, with a peak in late March. After applying internal quality control parameters, 903 samples were included in genomic analyses. Sequenced samples from Australia were representative of the global diversity of SARS-CoV-2, consistent with epidemiological findings of multiple importations and limited onward transmission. In total, 76 distinct genomic clusters were identified; these included large clusters associated with social venues, healthcare facilities and cruise ships. Sequencing of sequential samples from 98 patients revealed minimal intra-patient SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity. Phylodynamic modelling indicated a significant reduction in the effective viral reproductive number (Re) from 1.63 to 0.48 after the implementation of travel restrictions and population-level physical distancing. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a comprehensive framework for the use of SARS-CoV-2 genomics in public health responses. The application of genomics to rapidly identify SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains will become critically important as social restrictions ease globally.

They are important sources for the isolation, purification and characterization of natural compounds, including peptides with various functions. Innate immune antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play a critical role in warding off invading pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses. They may also have other biological functions such as endotoxin neutralization, chemotaxis, anti-inflammation, and wound healing. This article documents a bioinformatic analysis of over 1000 amphibian antimicrobial peptides registered in the Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD) in the past 18 years. These anuran peptides were discovered in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and America from 1985 to 2019. Genomic and peptidomic studies accelerated the discovery pace and underscored the necessity in establishing criteria for peptide entry into the APD. A total of 99.9% of the anuran antimicrobial peptides are less than 50 amino acids with an average length of 24 and a net charge of +2.5. Interestingly, the various amphibian peptide families (e.g., temporins, brevinins, esculentins) can be connected through multiple length-dependent relationships. With an increase in length, peptide net charge increases, while the hydrophobic content decreases. In addition, glycine, leucine, lysine, and proline all show linear correlations with peptide length. These correlations improve our understanding of amphibian peptides and may be useful for prediction and design of new linear peptides with potential applications in treating infectious diseases, cancer and diabetes.","Wang, Guangshun",Antibiotics (Basel),579,16

To enter human cells, receptor binding domain of S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-RBD) binds to peptidase domain (PD) of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Employing peptides to inhibit binding between SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2-PD is a therapeutic solution for COVID-19. Previous experimental study found that 23-mer peptide (SBP1) bound to SARS-CoV-2-RBD with lower affinity than ACE2. To increase SBP1 affinity, our previous study used residues 21–45 of α1 helix of ACE2-PD (SPB25) to design peptides with predicted affinity better than SBP1 and SPB25 by increasing interactions of residues that do not form favorable interactions with SARS-CoV-2-RBD. To design SPB25 with better affinity than ACE2, we employed computational protein design to increase interactions of residues reported to form favorable interactions with SARS-CoV-2-RBD and combine newly designed mutations with the best single mutations from our previous study. Molecular dynamics show that predicted binding affinities of three peptides (SPB25(Q22R), SPB25(F8R/K11W/L25R) and SPB25(F8R/K11F/Q22R/L25R)) are better than ACE2. Moreover, their predicted stabilities may be slightly higher than SBP1 as suggested by their helicities. This study developed an approach to design SARS-CoV-2 peptide binders with predicted binding affinities better than ACE2. These designed peptides are promising candidates as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.","Sitthiyotha, Thassanai; Chunsrivirot, Surasak",Sci Rep,579,16

We wished to study, in a French military medical unit assisting one of the country's largest armed forces populations, the impact of teleconsultation and the systematic isolation of all possible, probable and confirmed cases of COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective study carried out from March 9 to May 31, 2020 on the basis of our activity register. The variables collected included type of medical consultation procedure, occupational status, classification of cases and date of onset of first symptoms. We have paralleled our activity with that of SOS Médecins and the emergency departments of the Île-de-France region. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: During this period, 1719 episodes of care (teleconsultations or physical consultations) were recorded, of which 91% (n = 1561) were linked to COVID-19. We identified 598 “suspected” (possible and probable) and confirmed cases. “Isolated” teleconsultations (not followed by a face-to-face medical consultation, sample taking or necessitating the dispatch of prompt assistance) represented 86% of episodes of care (n = 1482). Comparison of our activity and the number of new cases with the databases of SOS Médecins and the Île-de-France emergency services suggests that our isolation strategy was timely and effective. CONCLUSION: The contribution of teleconsultation was substantial and reassuring. Teleconsultation makes it possible to absorb a large volume of patients, is easy to implement, and entails no nosocomial risk. Isolation of infected patients should be a priority during an outbreak. Once it has become a priority to rapidly bring an epidemic under control, this attitude must be extended to all symptomatic patients.","Allonneau, A.; Villeneuve, J.-P.; Sempere, H.; Couderc, A.; Nicaise, A.; Soula, M.; Kerrien, C.; Minaberry, S.; Bertrand, M.; Mourougou, M.; Coste, S.",Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,579,11

Here we report a retrospective analysis of a large real-world dataset obtained from 10 March to 6 July 2020 in an NHS Foundation Trust in England with 17,126 employees. 3,338 HCWs underwent symptomatic PCR testing (14.4% positive, 2.8% of all staff) and 11,103 HCWs underwent serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (8.4% positive, 5.5% of all staff). Seropositivity was lower than other hospital settings in England but higher than community estimates. Increased test positivity rates were observed in HCWs from BAME backgrounds and residents in areas of higher social deprivation. A multiple logistic regression model adjusting for ethnicity and social deprivation confirmed statistically significant increases in the odds of testing positive in certain occupational groups, most notably domestic services staff, nurses, and health-care assistants. PCR testing of symptomatic HCWs appeared to underestimate overall infection levels, probably due to asymptomatic seroconversion. Clinical outcomes were reassuring, with only a small minority of HCWs with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization (2.3%) or ICU management (0.7%) and with no deaths. Despite a relatively low level of HCW infection compared to other UK cohorts, there were nevertheless important differences in test positivity rates between occupational groups, robust to adjustment for demographic factors such as ethnic background and social deprivation. Quantitative and qualitative studies are needed to better understand the factors contributing to this risk. Robust informatics solutions for HCW exposure data are essential to inform occupational monitoring.","Hanrath, Aidan T.; Schim van der Loeff, Ina; Lendrem, Dennis W.; Baker, Kenneth F.; Price, David A.; McDowall, Peter; McDowall, Kiera; Cook, Susan; Towns, Peter; Schwab, Ulrich; Evans, Adam; Dixon, Jill; Collins, Jennifer; Burton-Fanning, Shirelle; Saunders, David; Harwood, Jayne; Samuel, Julie; Schmid, Matthias L.; Pareja-Cebrian, Lucia; Hunter, Ewan; Murphy, Elizabeth; Taha, Yusri; Payne, Brendan A.

The mass testing needed to stop the spread of the virus requires new molecular diagnostic tests that are faster and with reduced equipment requirement, but as sensitive as the current gold standard protocols based on polymerase chain reaction. We developed a fast (25-35 minutes) molecular test using reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification for simultaneous detection of two conserved regions of the virus, targeting the E and RdRP genes. The diagnostic platform offers two complementary detection methods: real-time fluorescence or visual dipstick. The analytical sensitivity of the test by real-time fluorescence was 9.5 (95% CI: 7.0-18) RNA copies per reaction for the E gene and 17 (95% CI: 11-93) RNA copies per reaction for the RdRP gene. The analytical sensitivity for the dipstick readout was 130 (95% CI: 82-500) RNA copies per reaction. The assay showed high specificity with both detection methods when tested against common seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV model samples. The dipstick readout demonstrated potential for point-of-care testing, with simple or equipment-free incubation methods and a user-friendly prototype smartphone application was proposed with data capture and connectivity. This ultrasensitive molecular test offers valuable advantages with a swift time-to-result and it requires minimal laboratory equipment compared to current gold standard assays.

We sought to provide descriptive statistics for stroke and ACS from a sample of hospitals throughout the United States, comparing data from March 2020 to similar months pre-COVID. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of 65 academic and community hospitals in the Vizient Clinical Data Base. The primary outcome is monthly count of stroke and ACS, and acute procedures for both, from February and March in 2020 compared to the same months in 2018 and 2019. Results are aggregated for all hospitals and reported by Census Region. Results We identified 51,246 strokes (42,780 ischemic, 8,466 hemorrhagic), 1,043 mechanical thrombectomies (MT), 836 tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administrations, 36,551 ACS, and 3,925 percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for ACS. In February 2020, relative to February 2018 and 2019, hospitalizations with any discharge diagnosis of stroke and ACS increased by 9.8% and 12.1%, respectively, while in March 2020 they decreased 18.5% and 7.5%, relative to March 2018 and 2019. When only including hospitalizations with the primary discharge diagnosis of stroke or ACS, in March 2020 they decreased 17.6% and 25.7%, respectively. In March 2020, tPA decreased 3.3%, MT increased 18.8%, although in February 2020 it had increased 36.8%, and PCI decreased 14.7%. These decreases were observed in all Census regions. Conclusions Following greater recognition of the risks of COVID-19, hospitalizations with stroke and ACS were markedly diminished in a geographically diverse sample of United States hospitals. Because the most likely explanation is that some patients with stroke and ACS did not seek medical care, the underlying reasons for this decrease warrant additional study to inform public health efforts and clinical care during this and future pandemics.","de Havenon, A.; Ney, J.; Callaghan, B.; Delic, A.; Hohmann, S.; Shippey, E.; Yaghi, S.; Anadani, M.; Esper, G.; Majersik, J.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,579,9

We have examined this directly by a comparative RNA-Seq analysis of KBM-7 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and KBM-7 cells in which the NUDT2 Ap(4)A hydrolase gene had been disrupted (NuKO cells), causing a 175-fold increase in intracellular Ap(4)A. 6,288 differentially expressed genes were identified with P < 0.05. Of these, 980 were up-regulated and 705 down-regulated in NuKO cells with a fold-change ≥ 2. Ingenuity(®) Pathway Analysis (IPA(®)) was used to assign these genes to known canonical pathways and functional networks. Pathways associated with interferon responses, pattern recognition receptors and inflammation scored highly in the down-regulated set of genes while functions associated with MHC class II antigens were prominent among the up-regulated genes, which otherwise showed little organization into major functional gene sets. Tryptophan catabolism was also strongly down-regulated as were numerous genes known to be involved in tumor promotion in other systems, with roles in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Conversely, some pro-apoptotic genes were up-regulated. Major upstream factors predicted by IPA(®) for gene down-regulation included NFκB, STAT1/2, IRF3/4 and SP1 but no major factors controlling gene up-regulation were identified. Potential mechanisms for gene regulation mediated by Ap(4)A and/or NUDT2 disruption include binding of Ap(4)A to the HINT1 co-repressor, autocrine activation of purinoceptors by Ap(4)A, chromatin remodeling, effects of NUDT2 loss on transcript stability, and inhibition of ATP-dependent regulatory factors such as protein kinases by Ap(4)A. Existing evidence favors the last of these as the most probable mechanism. Regardless, our results suggest that the NUDT2 protein could be a novel cancer chemotherapeutic target, with its inhibition potentially exerting strong anti-tumor effects via multiple pathways involving metastasis, invasion, immunosuppression and apoptosis.","Marriott, Andrew S.; Vasieva, Olga; Fang, Yongxiang; Copeland, Nikki A.; McLennan, Alexander G.; Jones, Nigel J.",PLoS One,579,20

It could, however, affect their involvement in advance care planning and patients’ quality of death. Recent studies on this topic have mostly focused on advance directives but not ACP and nurses in the ward setting. This study aimed to assess the perception of Hong Kong nursing undergraduates of the nurse’s role in advance care planning and examine its associations with knowledge, attitude, and experience. A cross-sectional 57-item survey was delivered to nursing undergraduates between June and August 2020. The chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test were used for univariate analysis. The multiple logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. A total of 469 participants were assessed for eligibility; 242 of them were included in the data analysis, with a response rate of 97.6%. The majority of respondents—77.3% (95% CI: 72.0–82.6%)—perceived having a role in ACP, but large discrepancies were found between their perception of their role regarding different aspects of ACP. Participants who had a better knowledge status (p = 0.029) or supported the use of ACP (p < 0.001) were more likely to have a positive perception of their role in ACP. A negative correlation was found between the experience of life threat and positive role perception (p < 0.001). Through strengthening training, the role clarity of nursing undergraduates could be achieved, maximizing their cooperation with and implementation of ACP in their future nursing career. The enhancement of end-of-life education could also be undertaken to fill nursing undergraduates’ knowledge gap in this area and change their attitudes.","Ng, Suet Ying; Wong, Eliza Lai-Yi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,579,22

Although such vectors are usually “gutted” and are replication defective, they are subjected to clearance by the host cells by immune recognition and destruction. Unfolded protein response (UPR) is a naturally evolved cyto-protective signaling pathway which is triggered due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress caused by accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in its lumen. The UPR signaling consists of three signaling pathways, namely PKR-like ER kinase, activating transcription factor 6, and inositol-requiring protein-1. Once activated, UPR triggers the production of ER molecular chaperones and stress response proteins to help reduce the protein load within the ER. This occurs by degradation of the misfolded proteins and ensues in the arrest of protein translation machinery. If the burden of protein load in ER is beyond its processing capacity, UPR can activate pro-apoptotic pathways or autophagy leading to cell death. Viruses are naturally evolved in hijacking the host cellular translation machinery to generate a large amount of proteins. This phenomenon disrupts ER homeostasis and leads to ER stress. Alternatively, in the case of gutted vectors used in gene therapy, the excess load of recombinant vectors administered and encountered by the cell can trigger UPR. Thus, in the context of gene therapy, UPR becomes a major roadblock that can potentially trigger inflammatory responses against the vectors and reduce the efficiency of gene transfer.","Sen, Dwaipayan; Balakrishnan, Balaji; Jayandharan, Giridhara R.",Front Microbiol,579,28

At the present time, clinical and forensic autopsies of SARS-CoV-2 virus-positive cases, as well as handling of potentially infected biological samples in forensic practice have given guidance. However, less attention has been given to the development of specific adjustments to the existing crime scene investigation protocols and procedures for this exceptional time. This manuscript aims to share the methods and strategies adopted for the investigation of high priority criminal cases during the pandemic. Furthermore, other pandemic-related processes are critically explored, in order to propose adjustments for any forensic services to be prepared to face similar challenges in the future.

However, there is a dearth of report on the description of the clinical characteristics of the disease in patients from Nigeria. This study was designed to provide a description of the clinical and demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria. Methods: This study is a case series that includes patients that are evaluated between June and August 30, 2020, and diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient health records were reviewed and evaluated to describe the clinical characteristics on presentation. Results: A total of 154 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, with a mean age (S.D.) of 46.16 (13.701). Most of the patients survived (mortality rate of 2.6%), and were symptomatic (89.6%). There were more males (74.7%) than females, and the most common symptoms were fever, breathing difficulty, dry cough and malaise. Co-morbidities were also present in almost half of the study participants (49.4%). Conclusion: This study presents the most extensive description, to date, on the clinical and demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria. Males are more likely than females to be infected with COVID-19 and the most occurring symptoms are fever, breathing difficulty, malaise, dry cough and chest pain.

Failure by the microarray to identify a base, compared to the reference sequence, is designated an 'N-call.' This study re-examined the N-call distribution of mtDNA samples sequenced by the Affymetrix MitoChip v.2.0, based on the hypothesis that N-calls may represent insertions or deletions (indels) in mtDNA. FINDINGS: We analysed 16 patient mtDNA samples using MitoChip. N-calls by the proprietary GSEQ software were significantly reduced when either of the freeware on-line algorithms ResqMi or sPROFILER was utilized. With sPROFILER, this decrease in N-calls had no effect on the homoplasmic or heteroplasmic mutation levels compared to GSEQ software, but ResqMi produced a significant change in mutation load, as well as producing longer N-cell stretches. For these reasons, further analysis using ResqMi was not attempted. Conventional DNA sequencing of the longer N-calls stretches from sPROFILER revealed 7 insertions and 12 point mutations. Moreover, analysis of single-base N-calls of one mtDNA sample found 3 other point mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to analyse N-calls produced from GSEQ software for the MitoChipv2.0. By narrowing the focus to longer stretches of N-calls revealed by sPROFILER, conventional sequencing was able to identify unique insertions and point mutations. Shorter N-calls also harboured point mutations, but the absence of deletions among N-calls suggests that probe confirmation affects binding and thus N-calling. This study supports the contention that the GSEQ is more capable of assigning bases when used in conjunction with sPROFILER.","Zamzami, Mazin A; Price, Gareth R; Taylor, Robert W; Blakely, Emma L; Oancea, Iulia; Bowling, Francis; Duley, John A",BMC Res Notes,579,21

To understand and predict the transmission dynamics of this disease, mathematical models can be very effective. It has been shown that the fractional order is related to the memory effects, which seems to be more effective for modeling the epidemic diseases. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose fractional-order susceptible individuals, asymptomatic infected, symptomatic infected, recovered, and deceased (SEIRD) model for the spread of COVID-19. We consider both classical and fractional-order models and estimate the parameters by using the real data of Italy, reported by the World Health Organization. The results show that the fractional-order model has less root-mean-square error than the classical one. Finally, the prediction ability of both of the integer- and fractional-order models is evaluated by using a test data set. The results show that the fractional model provides a closer forecast to the real data.","Rajagopal, Karthikeyan; Hasanzadeh, Navid; Parastesh, Fatemeh; Hamarash, Ibrahim Ismael; Jafari, Sajad; Hussain, Iqtadar",Nonlinear Dyn,579,6

Catalytic microtubes play simultaneous roles of the oxygen bubble producing microreactors and oxygen bubble-driven micropumps. An autonomous pumping of peroxide fuel takes place through the microtubes by the recoiling microbubbles. Due to optimal reaction–diffusion processes, gas supersaturation, leading to favorable bubble nucleation conditions, strain-engineered catalytic microtubes with longer length produce oxygen microbubbles at concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in approximately ×1000 lower in comparison to shorter tubes. Dynamic regimes of tubular nanomembrane-based oxygen microbubble generators reveal that this depends on microtubes’ aspect ratio, hydrogen peroxide fuel concentration and fuel compositions. Different dynamic regimes exist, which produce specific bubble frequencies, bubble size and various amounts of oxygen. In this study, the rolled-up Ti/Cr/Pd microtubes integrated on silicon substrate are used to study oxygen evolution in different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and surfactants. Addition of Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactants leads to a decrease of bubble diameter and an increase of frequencies of bubble recoil. Moreover, an increase of temperature (from 10 to 35 °C) leads to higher frequencies of oxygen bubbles and larger total volumes of produced oxygen.","Naeem, Sumayyah; Naeem, Farah; Zhang, Jing; Mujtaba, Jawayria; Xu, Kailiang; Huang, Gaoshan; Solovev, Alexander A.; Mei, Yongfeng",Micromachines (Basel),579,16

Crucial to halting PDCoV transmission and infection is the development of effective therapies and vaccines. The spike (S) protein of coronavirus is the major target of host neutralizing antibodies, however the immunodominant neutralizing region in the S protein of PDCoV has not been defined. Here, three truncations of the PDCoV S protein were generated, the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit (NTD, amino acids (aa) 50–286), the C-terminal domain of the S1 subunit (CTD, aa 278–616), and S2 subunit (aa 601–1087). The proteins were expressed using an E. coli expression system. Polyclonal antisera against the three recombinant proteins were produced in rabbits and mice. All three antisera were able to inhibit PDCoV infection in vitro, as determined by virus neutralization assay, fluorescent focus neutralization assay, and plaque-reduction neutralization. The CTD-specific antisera had the most potent PDCoV-neutralizing effect, indicating that the CTD region may contain the major neutralizing epitope(s) in the PDCoV S protein. Based on these findings, CTD may be a promising target for development of an effective vaccine against PDCoV infection in pigs.","Chen, Rui; Fu, Jiayu; Hu, Jingfei; Li, Cheng; Zhao, Yujia; Qu, Huan; Wen, Xintian; Cao, Sanjie; Wen, Yiping; Wu, Rui; Zhao, Qin; Yan, Qigui; Huang, Yong; Ma, Xiaoping; Han, Xinfeng; Huang, Xiaobo",Virus Res,579,17

In view of the limited data on the risk of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and transfer of maternal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, the present study was undertaken. METHODS: A prospective study including 57 pregnant women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test (SARS-CoV-2-RNA+) and 59 neonates born to them was conducted at Pune, India. 39 viral RNA negative (SARS-CoV-2-RNA-negative) pregnant women and their 39 neonates were included as controls. Neonatal nasal swab/cord blood samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-PCR for investigation of perinatal transmission. Transfer of maternal antibodies was studied using ELISA and PRNT. RESULTS: 10/57 SARS-CoV-2-RNA+ mothers were symptomatic. The duration between COVID-19 diagnosis and delivery was ≤ 7 days for 82.4%. Perinatal transmission as evidenced by viral RNA in the neonatal nasal swab/cord blood (CB) was 3.6%. IgG-anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 21.6%. Of the 39 neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-RNA-negative mothers, 20 (51%) and none, respectively, were positive for IgG-anti-SARS-CoV-2 and viral RNA. Preterm deliveries were higher in SARS-CoV-2-RNA+ (18.6%) than SARS-CoV-2 RNA-negative (0/39) mothers (p < 0.005). Respiratory distress at birth (< 4 h) was higher among neonates of SARS-CoV-2-RNA+ (20/59, 33.9%) than SARS-CoV-2-RNA-negative mothers (3/39, 7.7%; p < 0.001). ~ 75% IgG-positives exhibited neutralization potential with mean PRNT titers of 42.4 ± 24 (SARS-CoV-2-RNA+) and 72.3 ± 46.7 (SARS-CoV-2 RNA-negative); higher in the latter (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The rate of perinatal transmission was low. Transfer of maternal antibodies was lower among SARS-CoV-2-RNA+ mothers than SARS-CoV-2-RNA-negative mothers with subclinical infection during pregnancy. Presence of neutralizing antibodies in majority of IgG-positives suggests protection from SARS-CoV-2 in early life.","Malshe, Nandini; Patnaik, Suprabha K.; Lalwani, Sanjay; Suryawanshi, Pradeep; Kulkarni, Ruta; Mhaske, Suhas; Mishra, Akhilesh Chandra; Arankalle, Vidya",Infection,579,20

However, intestinal and extra-intestinal pathogenicity and viremia of porcine G9 RVAs has remained largely unreported. In this study, colostrum-deprived piglets were orally infected with a porcine G9P[23] or G9P[7] strain. Histopathologically, both strains induced characteristic small intestinal lesions. Degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells were observed in the extra-intestinal tissues, but most predominantly in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). RVA antigen was continuously detected in the small intestinal mucosa and MLNs, but only transiently in cells of the liver, lung, and choroid plexus. Viral RNA levels were much higher in the feces and the MLNs compared to other tissues. The onset of viremia occurred at day post infection (DPI) 1 with the amount of viral RNA reaching its peak at DPI 3 or 5, before decreasing significantly at DPI 7 and remaining detectable until DPI 14. Our data suggest that porcine G9 RVAs have a strong small intestinal tropism, are highly virulent for piglets, have the ability to escape the small intestine, spread systemically via viremia, and replicate in extra-intestinal tissues. In addition, MLNs might act as a secondary site for viral amplification and the portal of systemic entry. These results add to our understanding of the pathogenesis of human G9 RVAs, and the validity of the pig model for use with both human and pig G9 RVAs in further studies.","Kim, Ha-Hyun; Park, Jun-Gyu; Matthijnssens, Jelle; Kim, Hyun-Jeong; Kwon, Hyung-Jun; Son, Kyu-Yeol; Ryu, Eun-Hye; Kim, Deok-Song; Lee, Woo Song; Kang, Mun-Il; Yang, Dong-Kun; Lee, Ju-Hwan; Park, Su-Jin; Cho, Kyoung-Oh",Vet Microbiol,579,16

It is well recognized that irregularly provoked T cells participate in the pathological immune responses. As a novel nanomaterial with promising applications, tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (TFNA) nanostructure was found to have immune regulatory effects on T cells in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To verify the successful fabrication of TFNA, the morphology of TFNA was observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and dynamic light scattering. The regulatory effect of TFNA was evaluated by flow cytometry after cocultured with CD3+ T cells isolated from healthy donors. Moreover, the associated signaling pathways were investigated. Finally, we verified our results on the T cells from patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), which is a typical autoimmune disease induced by T cells. RESULTS: We revealed the alternative regulatory functions of TFNA in human primary T cells with steady status via the JNK signaling pathway. Moreover, by inhibiting both JNK and ERK phosphorylation, TFNA exhibited significant suppressive effects on IFNγ secretion from provoking T cells without affecting TNF secretion. Similar immune regulatory effects of TFNA were also observed in autoreactive T cells from patients with NMOSD.

However, limited data exist on systemic O(2) utilization. The objective of this study was to examine systemic O(2) utilization in a case series of patients with this disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March 24, and April 9, 2020, 8 patients intubated for severe COVID-19 respiratory failure had near-simultaneous drawing of arterial blood gas (ABG), central venous blood gas (cVBG), and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO(2)) at a mean of 6.1 days into hospitalization. Three patients were managed with indirect cardiac output (CO) monitoring by FloTrac sensor and Vigileo monitor (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). The oxygen extraction index (OEI; SaO(2)-ScvO(2)/SaO(2)) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF; CaO(2)-CvO(2)/CaO(2) ≥ 100) were calculated. Values for hyperoxia (ScvO(2) ≥ 90%), normoxia (ScvO(2) 71–89%), and hypoxia (ScvO(2) ≤ 70%) were based on the literature. Mean values were calculated. RESULTS: The mean partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)) was 102 with a mean fraction of inspired O(2) (FiO(2)) of 44%. One patient was hyperoxic with a reduced OEI (17%). Five patients were normoxic, but 2 had a reduced OEF (mean 15.9%). Two patients were hypoxic but had increased systemic O(2) utilization based on OEF or OEI. CONCLUSION: In select patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory failure, O(2) delivery (DO(2)) was found to exceed O(2) utilization.

An analysis of proteomics and translatome data indicated that SARS-CoV-2 replication is associated with a downregulation of host cell protease inhibitors. Hence, aprotinin may compensate for downregulated host cell proteases during later virus replication cycles. Aprotinin displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in different cell types (Caco2, Calu-3, and primary bronchial epithelial cell air–liquid interface cultures) and against four virus isolates.

The number of cases and deaths increased dramatically in some countries from March 2020. The objective of our study was to examine potential associated factors with country-variation in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in the world. Methods: We performed a retrospective geographic study including all countries with the most recent available data on free access on the web. We analyzed univariate and multivariable correlation between both the number of reported cases and deaths by country and demographic, socioeconomic characteristics, lockdown as major control measure, average annual temperature and relative humidity. We performed simple linear regression, independent t test and ANOVA test for univariate analyses and negative binomial regression model for multivariable analyses. Results: We analyzed data of 186 countries from all world regions. As of 13th April 2020, a total of 1 804 302 COVID-19 cases and 113 444 deaths were reported. The reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths by countries was associated with the number of days between the first case and lockdown, the number of cases at lockdown, life expectancy at birth, average annual temperature and the socio-economic level. Countries which never implemented BCG vaccination reported higher mortality than others.

Although meat means an important source of nutrients, it is also evident that a great consumption of this source of proteins has also a negative environmental impact. Livestock production does not only have a negative influence on GHG emissions, but also on the water footprint, water pollution, and water scarcity. With respect to human health, in 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) stated that red meat was a probable carcinogen to humans (Group 2A), while consumption of processed meat was carcinogenic to humans (Group 1). Most environmental contaminants (PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PBDEs, PCNs, etc.) that are frequently found in meats are highly soluble in fats. Therefore, avoiding ingesting fats from red meats and meat products, doubtless would help in the prevention, not only of the well-known cardiovascular diseases derived of fats consumption, but also of certain kinds of cancers, mainly colorectal cancer. On the other hand, consumption of meat – especially wild meat – is related to virus infections, as many viruses have been found in wild meat trade markets. Based on the scientific literature here reviewed, we have noted that the results of the investigations conducted after the statement of the IARC, have corroborated the recommendation of reducing significantly the consumption of red meats and meat products. In turn, the reduction of meat consumption should contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions and their considerable impact on global warming and climate change.

Among those affected, cancer patients may have a worse outcome compared to the general population because of their depressed immune status. As the health resources of most countries are limited, clinicians may face painful decisions about which patients to save if they require artificial ventilation. Cancer patients, especially the older ones, may be denied supportive care because of their shorter life expectancy. Thus, special considerations should be taken to prevent infection of older cancer patients and to provide them with adequate social support during their cancer treatment. The following proposal was reached: (1) Education of health care providers about the special needs of older cancer patients and their risks of infection. (2) Special consideration such as surgical masks and separate scheduling should be made to protect them from being infected. (3) Social services such as patient navigators should be provided to ensure adequate medical supply, food, and daily transportation to cancer centers. (4) Close monitoring through phone calls, telecommunication to ensure social distancing and psychological support from patient family to prevent anxiety and depression. (5) Shorter course of radiotherapy by use of hypofractionation where possible to decrease the needs for daily transportation and exposure to infection. (6) Enrollment of older cancer patients in clinical trials for potential antiviral medications if infection does occur. (7) Home health care telemedicine may be an effective strategy for older cancer patients with COVID-19 infection to avoid hospital admission when health care resources become restricted. (8) For selected patients, immunotherapy and targeted therapy may become the systemic therapy of choice for older cancer patients and need to be tested in clinical trials.","Nguyen, Nam P.; Vinh-Hung, Vincent; Baumert, Brigitta G.; Zamagni, Alice; Arenas, Meritxell; Motta, Micaela; Lara, Pedro Carlos; Myint, Arthur Sun; Bonet, Marta; Popescu, Tiberiu; Vuong, Te; Appalanaido, Gokula Kumar; Trigo, Lurdes; Karlsson, Ulf; Thariat, Juliette",Cancers (Basel),579,11

Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have high similarity of their genomic sequences and share the same cellular receptor (ACE2), it is essential to learn the lessons and experiences from the development of SARS-CoV vaccines for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge on the advantages and disadvantages of the SARS-CoV vaccine candidates and prospected the strategies for the development of safe, effective and broad-spectrum coronavirus vaccines for prevention of infection by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging and reemerging coronaviruses that may cause future epidemics or pandemics.","Ma, Cuiqing; Su, Shan; Wang, Jiachao; Wei, Lin; Du, Lanying; Jiang, Shibo",Microbes Infect,579,24

This new type of pneumonia is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Among the different disease types, cancer patients are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance, and the majority of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are immunosuppressive. This prompts us to consider if cancer patients were at an elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 1,524 cancer patients who were managed at our tertiary cancer institution-Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were reviewed during the period of Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 17, 2020. It was found that cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 than the general population. We identified twelve patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, with two recorded deaths (16.7%), albeit one patient passed away from a COVID-19 unrelated cause. Interestingly, only five of these patients were ongoing treatment at the time of contracting the virus, suggesting that hospital visitation was the likely factor contributing to the elevated incidence in cancer patients. Moreover, we also observed that the incidence of severe COVID-19 was not higher than in the general population. Consequently, for cancer patients who require treatment, proper isolation protocols must be in place to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Yu, Jing; Ouyang, Wen; Chua, Melvin L.K.; Xie, Conghua",,579,1

Influenza virus infection is initiated by the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) through receptor binding and fusion of viral and endosomal membranes. HA is synthesized as a precursor protein and requires cleavage by host cell proteases to gain its fusion capacity. Although cleavage of HA is crucial for virus infectivity, little was known about relevant proteases in the human airways for a long time. Recent progress in the identification and characterization of HA-activating host cell proteases has been considerable however and supports the idea of targeting HA cleavage as a novel approach for influenza treatment. Interestingly, certain bacteria have been demonstrated to support HA activation either by secreting proteases that cleave HA or due to activation of cellular proteases and thereby may contribute to virus spread and enhanced pathogenicity. In this review, we give an overview on activation of influenza viruses by proteases from host cells and bacteria with the main focus on recent progress on HA cleavage by proteases HAT and TMPRSS2 in the human airway epithelium. In addition, we outline investigations of HA-activating proteases as potential drug targets for influenza treatment.","Böttcher-Friebertshäuser, Eva; Klenk, Hans-Dieter; Garten, Wolfgang",Pathog Dis,579,24

METHODS: This study utilizes data from two large-scale surveys: the global behaviors and perceptions at the onset of COVID-19 pandemic and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). Linear regression models were used to estimate the effects of public trust and strictness of restriction measures on people’s compliance level. The model accounted for individual and daily variations in country-level stringency of preventative measures. Differences in the dynamics between public trust, the stringent level of government health guidelines and policy compliance were also examined among countries based on political regimes. RESULTS: We find strong evidence of the increase in compliance due to the imposition of stricter government restrictions. The examination of heterogeneous effects suggests that high public trust in government and the perception of its truthfulness double the impact of policy restrictions on public compliance. Among political regimes, higher levels of public trust significantly increase the predicted compliance as stringency level rises in authoritarian and democratic countries. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of public trust in government and its institutions during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results are relevant and help understand why governments need to address the risks of non-compliance among low trusting individuals to achieve the success of the containment policies.","Pak, Anton; McBryde, Emma; Adegboye, Oyelola A",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,579,28

Similar to other N-glycosylated proteins, the glycosylation of SARS-CoV E protein occurred co-translationally in the presence of microsomes. The SARS-CoV E protein is predicted to be a double-spanning membrane protein lacking a conventional signal peptide. Both of the transmembrane regions (a.a. 11–33 and 37–59) are predicted to be α-helices, which penetrate into membranes by themselves. As expected, these two transmembrane regions inserted a cytoplasmic protein into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Either of these two transmembrane domains co-localized with M protein.

The annual average PM(1) concentration was 26.31 μg/m(3) (range: 7.00–73.40 μg/m(3)). The concentrations of most metals were higher in winter and lower in autumn and summer. Mn and Ni had the highest noncarcinogenic risk, and Cr the highest carcinogenic risk. The hazard index was below safe limit, and the integrated carcinogenic risk was less than precautionary value. There were no obvious differences in the simulation performances of BP-ANN and SVM models. However, in both models many elements had better simulation effects when input variables were atmospheric pollutants (SO(2), NO(2), CO, O(3) and PM(2.5)) rather than PM(1) and meteorological factors (temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and wind speed). Models performed better for Pb, Tl and Zn, as evidenced by training R and test R values consistently >0.85, whereas their performances for Ti and V were relatively poor. Predicted results by the fully trained models showed atmospheric heavy metal pollution was heavier in December and January and lighter in August and July of 2019. For the period covering the COVID-19 outbreak in China, from January to March 2020, most of the predicted element concentrations were lower than in 2018 and 2019, and the concentrations of nearly all metals were lowest during the nationwide implementation of countermeasures taken against the pandemic.","Li, Huiming; Dai, Qian'ying; Yang, Meng; Li, Fengying; Liu, Xuemei; Zhou, Mengfan; Qian, Xin",Chemosphere,579,12

This is a retrospective analysis. From January to May 2020, a total of 69 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Third Central Hospital and the Jinnan Hospital (both situated in Tianjin) were enrolled in the disease group. According to the severity, these patients were divided into mild group (15 cases), moderate group (46 cases), and severe group (8 cases). In the same period, 70 non-infected patients were enrolled in control group. The level of white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (NEU#), absolute lymphocyte count (LY#), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and platelet-large contrast ratio (P-LCR) before and after treatment were analyzed. Binary logistic regression analysis is used to establish a mathematical model of the relationship between these indexes and the outcome of severe COVID-19 patients. The receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve is used to further explore the prognosis value of MPV, P-LCR, NLR separately and jointly in COVID-19 patients. Compare to the control group, WBC and NE# increase (Z=-5.63, P<0.01;Z=-9.19,P<0.01) and LY# decrease (Z=-9.34, P<0.01) in the severe group; NLR increase with the aggravation of the disease, there is significant difference between groups (Z=17.61, P<0.01); PLT, PDW, MPV and P-LCR decrease with the aggravation of the disease, there is significant difference between groups (Z=9.47, P<0.01; Z=11.41, P<0.01; Z =16.76, P<0.01; Z=13.97, P<0.01).

There is a negative correlation between MPV, P-LCR and severe COVID-19 patients (OR=1.004, P=0.034; OR=1.097, P=0.046). There is a positive correlation between NLR and severe COVID-19 patients (OR=1.052, P=0.016). MPV and P-LCR of patients with good prognosis after treatment were significantly higher than those before treatment (Z=-6.47, P<0.01; Z=-5.36, P<0.01). NLR was significantly lower than that before treatment (Z=-8.13, P<0.01). MPV and P-LCR in poor prognosis group were significantly lower than those before treatment (Z=-9.46, P<0.01; Z=-6.81, P<0.01). NLR was significantly higher than that before treatment (Z=-3.24, P<0.01). There were significant differences between good and poor prognosis groups before and after treatment in MPV, P-LCR and NLR (P<0.01).

METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study in eight Italian ICUs from February to May 2020; data were collected through an interactive electronic database. Kaplan–Meier analysis (limit product method) was used to identify the occurrence of infections and risk of acquisition. RESULTS: During the study period 248 patients were recruited in the eight participating ICUs. Ninety (36.3%) patients developed at least one episode of secondary infection. An ICU length of stay between 7 and 14 days was characterized by a higher occurrence of infectious complications, with ventilator-associated pneumonia being the most frequent. At least one course of antibiotic therapy was given to 161 (64.9%) patients. Overall ICU and hospital mortality were 33.9% and 42.9%, respectively. Patients developing bacteremia had a higher risk of ICU mortality [45.9% vs. 31.6%, odds ratio 1.8 (95% CI 0.9–3.7), p = 0.069] and hospital mortality [56.8% vs. 40.3%, odds ratio 1.9 (95% CI 1.1–3.9), p = 0.04].

However, they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel patterns due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 50 States of the US and Washington D.C, the capital city of the US. State-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the people (e.g., education, income, family size, and employment status), built environment data (e.g., population density), and the number of COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast, households with a high number of family members and high income are less interested in reopening the economy. The accuracy of the model is reasonable (i.e., the model can correctly classify 56.18% of the sentiments). The Pearson chi-squared test indicates that this model has high goodness-of-fit.

Several types of vaccine have been designed to teach the immune system how to fight off certain kinds of pathogens. mRNA vaccines are the most important candidate vaccines because of their capacity for rapid development, high potency, safe administration and potential for low-cost manufacture. mRNA vaccine acts by training the body to recognize and response to the proteins produced by disease-causing organisms such as viruses or bacteria. This type of vaccine is the fastest candidate to treat COVID-19 but it currently facing several limitations. In particular, it is a challenge to design stable mRNA molecules because of the inefficient in vivo delivery of mRNA, its tendency for spontaneous degradation and low protein expression levels. This work designed and implemented a sequence deep model based on bidirectional GRU and LSTM models applied on the Stanford COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dataset to predict the mRNA sequences responsible for degradation by predicting five reactivity values for every position in the sequence. Four of these values determine the likelihood of degradation with/without magnesium at high pH (pH 10) and high temperature (50 degrees Celsius) and the fifth reactivity value is used to determine the likely secondary structure of the RNA sample. The model relies on two types of features, namely numerical and categorical features, where the categorical features are extracted from the mRNA sequences, structure and predicted loop. These features are represented and encoded by numbers, and then, the features are extracted using embedding layer learning. There are five numerical features depending on the likelihood for each pair of nucleotides in the RNA. The model gives promising results because it predicts the five reactivity values with a validation mean columnwise root mean square error (MCRMSE) of 0.125 using LSTM model with augmentation and the codon encoding method. Codon encoding outperforms Base encoding in MCRMSE validation error using the LSTM model meanwhile Base encoding outperforms codon encoding due to less over-fitting and the difference between the training and validation loss error is 0.008.","Qaid, Talal S.; Mazaar, Hussein; Alqahtani, Mohammed S.; Raweh, Abeer A.; Alakwaa, Wafaa",PeerJ Comput Sci,579,16

Here we present a pivotal molecular mechanism of viral protein translation that relies on the mitochondrial translation machinery. We found that rare codons such as Leu-TTA are highly enriched in many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and these codons are essential for the regulation of viral protein expression. SARS-CoV-2 controls the translation of its spike gene by hijacking host mitochondria through 5’ leader and 3’UTR sequences that contain mitochondrial localization signals and activate the EGR1 pathway.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spread across the world causing a dramatic number of infections and deaths. No data are available about the effects of an infection in patients affected by celiac disease (CD) in terms of the development of related symptoms and antibodies. We aimed to investigate the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in celiac patients. Design. During a lockdown, the celiac patients living in the Milan area were contacted and interviewed about the development of COVID-19 symptoms as well as adherence to an anti-virus lifestyle and a gluten-free diet (GFD). They were also given a stress questionnaire to fill in. The development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA (anti-RBD and N proteins) and the expression of the duodenal ACE2 receptor were investigated. When available, duodenal histology, anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTGA), presence of immunologic comorbidities and adherence to the GFD were analysed as possible risk factors. Results. 362 celiac patients have been interviewed and 42 (11%) presented with COVID-19 symptoms. The presence of symptoms was not influenced by tTGA positivity, presence of duodenal atrophy or adherence to GFD. 37% of the symptomatic patients presented anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins (Ig). Globally, 18% of celiac patients showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig vs 25% of the non-celiac control (p=0.18). The values of anti-RBD IgG/IgA and anti-N IgG did not differ from the non-celiac controls. Celiac patients had a significant lower level of anti-N IgA. The ACE2 receptor was detected in the non-atrophic duodenal mucosa of celiac patients; atrophy was associated with a lower expression of the ACE2 receptor. Conclusion. CD patients have an anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig positiveness and profile similar to non-celiac controls, except for anti-N IgA. The main celiac parameters and adherence to the GFD do not influence the development of a different Ig profile.","Elli, L.; Facciotti, F.; Lombardo, V.; Scricciolo, A.; Sanders, D.

Countries prioritize vaccinating health workers against COVID-19 because of their susceptibility to the virus. However, the acceptability of the vaccine varies across populations. Thus, this study aimed to determine the health care worker’s intentions to accept the COVID-19 vaccine and its associated factors in southwestern Ethiopia, 2021. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among health care workers in public hospitals in southwestern Ethiopia from March 15 to 28, 2021. A simple random sampling method was used to select 405 participants from each hospital. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics, such as frequency and percentage, were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression was also performed to identify factors associated with health care worker’s intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Statistically significant variables were selected based on p-values (<0.05) and the adjusted odds ratio was used to describe the strength of association with 95% confidence intervals. RESULT: Among the respondents, 48.4% [95% CI: 38.6, 58.2] of health care workers intended to accept COVID-19. Intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination was significantly associated with physicians (AOR = 9.27, 95% CI: 1.27–27.32), professionals with a history of chronic illness (AOR = 4.07, 95% CI: 2.02–8.21), perceived degree of risk of COVID-19 infection (AOR = 4.63, 95% CI: 1.26–16.98), positive attitude toward COVID-19 prevention (AOR = 6.08, 95% CI: 3.39–10.91) and good preventive practices (AOR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.58–5.08). CONCLUSION: In this study, the intention of health care workers to accept the COVID-19 vaccine was low. Professional types, history of chronic illness, perceived degree of risk to COVID-19 infection, attitude toward COVID-19 and preventive practices were found to be factors for intention to accept COVID-19 vaccine in professionals. It is important to consider professional types, history of chronic illness, perceived degree of risk to COVID-19, attitude of professionals and preventive behaviors to improve the intention of professionals’ vaccine acceptance.","Angelo, Abiy Tadesse; Alemayehu, Daniel Shiferaw; Dachew, Aklilu Mamo",PLoS One,579,16

Therefore, the prognosis of the disease may be more favourable in people who were under oral anticoagulant treatment before the COVID‐19 diagnosis. This study aims to evaluate the effects of chronic DOAC use on ICU admission and mortality in hospitalized patients due to COVID‐19 infection. METHOD: Between 1 September and 30 November 2020, 2760 patients hospitalized in our hospital due to COVID‐19 were screened. A total of 1710 patients who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups as those who use DOAC due to any cardiovascular disease before the COVID‐19 infection and those who do not. RESULTS: Seventy‐nine patients were enrolled in the DOAC group and 1631 patients in the non‐DOAC group. Median age of all study patient was 62 (52‐71 IQR) and 860 (50.5%) of them were female. The need for intensive care, in‐hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation were observed at higher rates in the DOAC group. Mortality was observed in 23 patients (29%) in the DOAC group, and it was statistically higher in the DOAC group (P = .002). In the multivariable analysis, age (OR: 1.047, CI: 1.02‐1.06, P < .001), male gender (OR: 1.8, CI: 1.3‐2.7, P = .02), lymphocyte count (OR: 0.45, CI: 0.30‐0.69, P < .001), procalcitonin (OR: 1.12, CI: 1.02‐1.23, P = .015), SaO(2) (OR: 0.8, CI: 0.77‐0.82, P < .001) and creatinine (OR: 2.59, CI: 1.3‐5.1, P = .006) were found to be associated with in‐hospital mortality. DOAC treatment was not found to be associated with lower in‐hospital mortality in multivariable analysis (OR:1.17, CI: 0.20‐6.60, P = .850). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the use of DOAC prior to hospitalization had no protective effect on in‐hospital mortality and intensive care need in hospitalized COVID‐19 patients.","Aslan, Burhan; Akyüz, Abdurrahman; Işık, Ferhat; Çap, Murat; İnci, Ümit; Kaya, İlyas; Karahan, Mehmet Zülküf; Aktan, Adem; Bilge, Önder; Özbek, Mehmet; Altıntaş, Bernas; Boyraz, Bedrettin",Int J Clin Pract,579,17

Owing to its antigenic variation, prevention of the diseases caused by this virus is difficult. In this study, two PEDV isolates with similar growth kinetics were successfully propagated in Vero cells. Complete genome sequence analysis showed that they have a 49nt deletion in the ORF3 gene and were classified into Group 1, the same group that includes the classical CV777 strain. Recombination analysis revealed that the event had occurred in the ORF1a gene, at 3596–6819 nt, among the two PEDV isolates and the CV777 and DR13 strains. During their continuous propagation, 14 nonsynonymous mutations occurred in the spike (S) gene of strain JS-2/2014 between generations G5 and G90, but there were no changes between G90 and G100. We assumed that strain JS-2/2014 might be attenuated by the 90th generation. Piglets orally fed with JS-2/2014 G90 showed no clinical symptoms, and no virus was detected in the feces and nasal fluid. In conclusion, JS-2/2014 was successfully identified by screening, was attenuated after propagation in Vero cells, and may serve as a candidate virus for vaccine preparations.","Jie, Tao; Benqiang, Li; Jinghua, Cheng; Ying, Shi; Huili, Liu",Arch Virol,579,16

Herein we present a simple, reproducible, and highly-customizable manual-entry tool to track ICU patients using new HIPAA-compliant Google Big Query technology for parsing large datasets. This innovative flow chart is useful and could be modified to serve the particular needs of different sub-specialists, particularly those that either rely heavily on hand-written notes or experience poor electronic medical record (EMR) penetration. METHODS: The tool was developed using a combination of three Google Enterprise features: Google Forms for data input, Google Sheets for data output, and Google Big Query for data parsing. Code was written in SQL. Sheets functions were used to transpose and filter parsed data. White and black box tests were performed to examine functionality. RESULTS: Our tool was successfully able to collect and output fictional patient data across all 57 data points specified by the intensivists and surgeons of Cardiovascular Department of Mt. Sinai Morningside Hospital. CONCLUSION: The functional tests performed demonstrate use of the tool. Though originally conceived to simplify patient data collection for newly relocated physicians to the ICU, our tool also overcomes financial and technological barriers previously described in low-income countries that could dramatically improve patient care and provide data to power future studies in these regions. With the original code provided, implementers may adapt our tool to best meet the requirements of their clinical setting and protocols during this very challenging time.","Newman, Noah; Gilman, Sam; Burdumy, Matt; Yimen, Mekeleya; Lattouf, Omar",Int J Med Inform,579,1

Purpose: We aimed to explore early warning information for patients with severe/critical COVID-19 based on quantitative analysis of chest CT images at the lung segment level. Materials and Methods: A dataset of 81 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treated at Wuhan Wuchang hospital in Wuhan city from 21 January 2020 to 14 February 2020 was retrospectively analyzed, including ordinary and severe/critical cases. The time course of all subjects was divided into four stages. The differences in each lobe and lung segment between the two groups at each stage were quantitatively analyzed using the percentage of lung involvement (PLI) in order to investigate the most important segment of lung involvement in the severe/critical group and its corresponding time point. Results: Lung involvement in the ordinary and severe/critical groups reached a peak on the 18th and 14th day, respectively. In the first stage, PLIs in the right middle lobe and the left superior lobe between the two groups were significantly different. In the second stage and the fourth stage, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups in the whole lung, right superior lobe, right inferior lobe and left superior lobe. The rapid progress of the lateral segment of the right middle lobe on the second day and the anterior segment of the right upper lobe on the 13th day may be a warning sign for severe/critical patients. Age was the most important demographic characteristic of the severe/critical group. Conclusion: Quantitative assessment based on the lung segments of chest CT images provides early warning information for potentially severe/critical patients.","Yuyun, Xu; Lexi, Yu; Haochu, Wang; Zhenyu, Shu; Xiangyang, Gong",Front Public Health,579,16

This infectious disease results in significant losses in the swine industry and specific anti-PRRSV drugs are needed. In this study, we evaluated a novel class of antisense compounds, peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (P-PMOs), for their ability to suppress PRRSV replication in cell culture. P-PMOs are analogs of single-stranded DNA and contain a modified backbone that confers highly specific binding to RNA and resistance to nucleases. Of six P-PMOs tested, one (‘5UP1’), with sequence complementary to the 5′-terminal 21 nucleotides of the PRRSV genome, was found to be highly effective at reducing PRRSV replication in a specific and dose-dependent manner in CRL11171 cells in culture. 5UP1 treatment generated up to a 4.5 log reduction in infectious PRRSV yield, while a control P-PMO had no effect on viral titer. Immunofluorescence assay with an anti-PRRSV monoclonal antibody confirmed the titer observations. The sequence-specificity of 5UP1 effect was confirmed in part by a cell-free luciferase reporter assay system, which showed that 5UP1-mediated inhibition of translation decreased if the target-RNA contained mispairings in relation to the 5UP1 P-PMO. Real-time RT-PCR showed that the production of PRRSV negative-sense RNA was reduced if 5UP1 was added to cells at up to 6 h post-virus inoculation. Cell viability assays detected no cytotoxicity of 5UP1 within the concentration-range of this study. These results indicate that P-PMO 5UP1 has potential as an anti-PRRSV agent.","Zhang, Yan-Jin; Stein, David A.; Fan, Su-Min; Wang, Kai-Yu; Kroeker, Andrew D.; Meng, Xiang-Jin; Iversen, Patrick L.; Matson, David O.",Vet Microbiol,579,21

It has been perceived that if an individual adhered to the MMR vaccine schedule that immunity to mumps virus (MuV) would be lifelong. Recent mumps outbreaks in individuals who had received two doses of the Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) vaccine has challenged the efficacy of the MMR vaccine. However, clinical symptoms, complications, viral shedding and transmission associated with mumps infection has been shown to be reduced in vaccinated individuals, demonstrating a benefit of this vaccine. Therefore, the question of what constitutes a good mumps vaccine and how its impact is assessed in this modern era remains to be addressed. Epidemiology of the individuals most affected by the outbreaks (predominantly young adults) and variance in the circulating MuV genotype have been well-described alluding to a collection of influences such as vaccine hesitancy, heterogeneous vaccine uptake, primary, and/or secondary vaccine failures. This review aims to discuss in detail the interplay of factors thought to be contributing to the current mumps outbreaks seen in highly vaccinated populations. In addition, how mumps diagnoses has progressed and impacted the understanding of mumps infection since a mumps vaccine was first developed, the limitations of current laboratory tests in confirming protection in vaccinated individuals and how vaccine effectiveness is quantified are also considered. By highlighting knowledge gaps within this area, this state-of-the-art review proposes a change of perspective regarding the impact of a vaccine in a highly vaccinated population from a clinical, diagnostic and public perspective, highlighting a need for a paradigm shift on what is considered vaccine immunity.","Connell, Anna R.; Connell, Jeff; Leahy, T.

Considering the historical uses of high‐voltage X‐ray beams for unresolvable pneumonia, we aimed to assess whether low‐dose whole‐lung irradiation (WLI) could provide any benefits for patients with refractory COVID‐19 pneumonia. METHODS: Eleven patients with refractory COVID‐19 pneumonia were treated with WLI to a total dose of 1 Gy and compared to 11 patients in a matched control group from June to November 2020. The study's primary endpoint was improvement of chest X‐ray severity score (CXRS), followed by changes in mean oxygen (O2) saturation and 28‐day mortality as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: The final CXRS was significantly lower in the WLI group (8.7 ± 2.5) compared to the control group (12.3 ± 3.3) (P: 0.016). Change of CXRS from the first to the last chest X‐ray was −2.2 ± 3.1 for the WLI group and 0.7 ± 3.9 for the control group, which showed a trend for lower CXRS in the WLI group (U = 30, p: 0.085). Mean O2 saturation showed insignificant improvement in the first 24 hours after radiotherapy (mean difference: 2.5 ± 4.1, Z=−1.6, P value: 0.11). Overall survival after 28 days was 32% in the WLI group and 11% in the control group (P: 0.48). The reason for death in many patients was not merely respiratory failure, but also other adverse situations like pneumothorax, cardiogenic shock and pulmonary thromboembolism.

Mortality from HFRS varies between hantaviruses; Hantaan and Dobrava show the highest, Seoul intermediate, and Puumala low mortality. Saaremaa, genetically closely related to Dobrava, is also known to induce HFRS, with low or no mortality. In this study, mice were inoculated with Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses to test for infectibility, lethality, viremia, nitric oxide production and antibody responses. Out of suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with 50, 500 and 5000 focus-forming units of Dobrava virus, respectively, 1/8, 2/8 and 7/8 died within 18–26 days. In all but one of the lethally infected mice high levels of replicating virus were detected, and most were positive for neutralizing antibodies and showed elevated levels of nitric oxide production. All suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with 50, 500, or 5000 focus-forming units of Saaremaa virus survived and all seroconverted. Clearly lower viral titers were observed for the Saaremaa virus-inoculated mice, also when sacrificed at day 18 after infection, compared to those in mice that died following Dobrava virus infection. Dobrava, Saaremaa, Puumala and Hantaan virus infections of adult mice were asymptomatic, and the anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG2a/IgG1-titer ratio was higher in mice inoculated with Dobrava virus than in those inoculated with Saaremaa virus. Elevated nitric oxide production was not detected in asymptomatically infected mice, and iNOS−/− mice, like normal mice, cleared viremia. In conclusion, we show that Dobrava virus and Saaremaa virus induce distinct differences in terms of survival, viremia, nitric oxide production and antibody responses in mice.","Klingström, Jonas; Hardestam, Jonas; Lundkvist, Åke",Microbes Infect,579,30

Additionally, we investigated its association with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and the impact of PTSD diagnosis on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in HCV infected subjects. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 127 HCV-infected outpatients recruited at a University Hospital in Salvador, Brazil. All subjects answered an orally-administered questionnaire to gather clinical and socio-demographic data. We investigated traumatic experiences and the subject's perception of the disease using the Trauma History Questionnaire. PTSD and other psychiatric diagnoses were assessed through the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Brazilian Version 5.0.0 (M.I.N.I. PLUS). HRQoL was assessed using Short-Form 36 (SF-36). RESULTS: Approximately 38.6% of the patients considered hepatitis C to be a traumatic experience. Of these, 60.7% had a PTSD diagnosis. PTSD was associated with significant impairment in quality of life for individuals in seven SF-36 domains as shown bymultivariate analysis: Role-Physical (β: −24.85; 95% CI: −42.08; −7.61), Bodily Pain (β: −19.36; 95% CI: −31.28; −7.45), General Health (β: −20.79; 95% CI: −29.65; −11.92), Vitality (β: −11.92; 95% CI: −20.74; −3.1), Social Functioning (β: −34.73; 95% CI: −46.79; −22.68), Role-Emotional (β: −26.07; 95% CI: −44.61; −7.53), Mental Health (β: −17.46; 95% CI: −24.38; −10.54). CONCLUSION: HCV is frequently a traumatic experience and it is strongly associated with PTSD diagnosis.

Anecdotal reports suggested that students found this experience rich for learning. Previous studies have explored alternative models of student service, however this defined medical student support role is novel. METHODS: Individual semi-structured interviews were recorded with 20 medical students at a UK medical school exploring their experiences of placement learning and experiences of working as healthcare assistants. Responses were analysed qualitatively using a framework approach. The framework was developed into a model describing key findings and their relationships. RESULTS: Interviews yielded data that broadly covered aspects of (1) Medical students’ experiences of clinical placement learning (2) Medical students’ experiences of working as medical student healthcare assistants (3) Learning resulting from working as a healthcare assistant (4) Hierarchies and professional barriers in the clinical environment (5) Influences on professional identity. Participants described barriers and facilitators of clinical learning and how assuming a healthcare assistant role impacted on learning and socialisation within the multidisciplinary team. Students became increasingly socialised within the healthcare team, contributing directly to patient care; the resulting social capital opened new opportunities for learning, team working and enhanced students’ interprofessional identity. Students described the impact of these experiences on their aspirations for their future practice. CONCLUSIONS: Changes to work patterns in healthcare and delivery models of medical education have eroded opportunities for students to contribute to healthcare delivery and be embedded within a team. This is impacting negatively on student learning and socialisation and we suggest that medical curricula have much to learn from nursing and allied health professional training. Longitudinal embedment with a multidisciplinary team, where students have a defined role and work directly with patients may not only add value to clinical service, but also overcome current barriers to effective placement learning and interprofessional identity formation for medical students.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is essential to COVID-19 pathogenesis, as the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) is required for viral entry and development of COVID-19. ACE2 regulates the protective arm of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that endows anti-hypertensive and anti-inflammatory effects in the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. Preclinical data suggest ACE2 might be downregulated after SARS-CoV-2 binding, and treatments that increase ACE2 may prevent cardiopulmonary injury. Development, testing, and mass production of novel ACE2 therapies may take years, whereas more effective treatments for COVID-19 are needed urgently. Metformin is a widely available anti-diabetic agent that has an excellent safety profile, and clinical and preclinical data suggest metformin may offer cardiopulmonary protection in COVID-19 via enhanced ACE2 expression.","Malhotra, Atul; Hepokoski, Mark; McCowen, Karen C.; Y-J Shyy, John",iScience,579,24

We evaluated the potential of physical exercise (in a nature setting) and nature therapy in improving mental wellbeing, among young adults with either stress, anxiety or depression symptoms. The study involved thirty subjects, who were equally divided into a nature-exercise group and a nature therapy group. The participants were briefed on the activities that they were to perform on a daily basis, and both groups performed their assigned activities concurrently for one week (27th April 2020 to 3rd May 2020) at urban greeneries accessible to them (rooftop parks, neighbourhood parks, home gardens). We used the depression, anxiety and stress scale – 21 items (DASS-21) to evaluate the mental health status of participants, once before beginning the study (baseline readings) and once at the end of the study (after a week of nature-exercise/nature therapy). There was a statistically significant reduction in stress, anxiety and depression symptoms for both the nature-exercise and nature therapy groups. However, when evaluating the effectiveness of exercise and nature therapy in treating stress, anxiety and depression symptoms on a case-by-case basis, it was discovered that nature therapy was more effective in treating mental health issues. Hence, nature therapy has the potential to be a form of preventive medicine, namely in preserving mental health during the COVID-19 crisis.","Sundara Rajoo, Keeren; Singh Karam, Daljit; Abdu, Arifin; Rosli, Zamri; James Gerusu, Geoffery",Urban For Urban Green,579,28

Methods: This paper reports on an observational study conducted by a team of researchers and doctors of the 118-Pre-Hospital and Emergency Department of SG Moscati of Taranto City in Italy. The study was conducted on a totality of 185 participants that were divided into three groups. The study group included COVID-19 affected patients (PP n = 80), the first control group included patients with different pathologies (non-COVID-19 NNp n = 62) of the SG Moscati Hospital, and the second control group included healthy individuals (NNh n = 43). The core of the current trial was focused on assessing the level of the vitamin D (serum 25(OH) D concentration), IL-6, and the renal glomerular filtrate (eGFR) in COVID-19 disease and non-COVID-19 patients in both groups. Results: It was observed that the majority of COVID-19-infected patients showed a progressive multi-organ involvement, especially in regard to the lung, kidney, and heart. The majority of the COVID-19 patients exhibited preexisting comorbidities which include cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal disorders accompanied by a severely low level of vitamin D, extremely high level of IL-6, and low glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The significant overall damages exerted by the immune-mediated responses under the hyper-expression of proinflammatory cytokines and interleukins, such as IL-6, may be facilitated by either a decreased level of vitamin D or the ageing process. The reduced presence of vitamin D was often found together with a reduced functionality of renal activity, as revealed by the low eGFR, and both were seen to be concomitant with an increased mortality risk in patients with lung disorders and heart failure (HF), whether it is showed at baseline or it develops during manifestation of COVID-19. Therefore, the documentation of the modifiable risk factors related to SARS-CoV-2 and lung impairment in older patients with kidney and heart disease may help the clinician to better manage the situation. Conclusions: This paper addresses how a low level of vitamin D and older age may be indicative of systemic worsening in patients with COVID-19, with a goal of providing a broader context in which to view a better therapeutic approach.","Balzanelli, Mario Giosuè; Distratis, Pietro; Lazzaro, Rita; Cefalo, Angelo; Catucci, Orazio; Aityan, Sergey Khachatur; Dipalma, Gianna; Vimercati, Luigi; Inchingolo, Alessio Danilo; Maggiore, Maria Elena; Mancini, Antonio; Santacroce, Luigi; Gesualdo, Loreto; Pham, Van Hung; Iacobone, Donatello; Contaldo, Maria; Serpico, Rosario; Scarano, Antonio; Lorusso, Felice; Toai, Tran Cong; Tafuri, Silvio; Migliore, Giovanni; Inchingolo, Angelo Michele; Nguyen, Kieu Cao Diem; Inchingolo, Francesco; Tomassone, Diego; Gargiulo Isacco, Ciro",Microorganisms,579,16

The aim of this study was to evaluate the physical activity levels of individuals and assess the effects of physical activity on quality of life, depression and anxiety levels during COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This cross-sectional study were included 2301 participants aged 20–75 years. The data were collected through the Google Forms web survey platform by the virtual snowball sampling method. In the multivariate analysis, the independent predictors were analyzed using possible factors identified in previous analyses by multinomial logistic regression analysis. Hosmer-Lemeshow and Omnibus tests were used to evaluate the logistic regression model and coefficients. RESULTS: The mean weekly energy consumption of the participants was 875±1588 MET-min, and only 6.9% were physically active enough to maintain their health. There was a weak positive relationship between physical activity levels and quality of life, while there was a weak negative relationship between physical activity levels, depression and anxiety (p<0.05). In the multinomial logistic regression model established for comparison of physically active and inactive participants, general health status and physical health status variables were statistically significant (p<0.05). However, relationships between psychological status, social relationships and environment scores, Beck Depression and Beck Anxiety Inventory scores were not statistically significant (p>0.05).

Our goal was to combine estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 household secondary attack rate (SAR) and explore variation in estimates of the household SAR. RESULTS: The overall pooled random-effects estimate of the household SAR was 17.1% (95% CI: 13.7-21.2%). In study-level, random-effects meta-regressions stratified by testing frequency (1 test, 2 tests, >2 tests), SAR estimates were 9.2% (95% CI: 6.7-12.3%), 17.5% (95% CI: 13.9-21.8%), and 21.3% (95% CI: 13.8-31.3%), respectively. Household SAR tended to be higher among older adult contacts and among contacts of symptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that SAR reported using a single follow-up test may be underestimated and that testing household contacts of COVID-19 cases on multiple occasions may increase the yield for identifying secondary cases.","Fung, Hannah F; Martinez, Leonardo; Alarid-Escudero, Fernando; Salomon, Joshua A; Studdert, David M; Andrews, Jason R; Goldhaber-Fiebert, Jeremy D",Clin Infect Dis,579,16

Methods: An agent-based model, Covasim, was calibrated to the local COVID-19 epidemiological and policy environment. Contact networks were modelled to capture transmission risks in households, schools and workplaces, and a variety of community spaces (e.g. public transport, parks, bars, cafes/restaurants) and activities (e.g. community or professional sports, large events). Policy changes that could prevent or reduce transmission in specific locations (e.g. opening/closing businesses) were modelled in the context of interventions that included testing, contact tracing (including via a smartphone app), and quarantine. Results: Policy changes leading to the gathering of large, unstructured groups with unknown individuals (e.g. bars opening, increased public transport use) posed the greatest risk, while policy changes leading to smaller, structured gatherings with known individuals (e.g. small social gatherings) posed least risk. In the model, epidemic impact following some policy changes took more than two months to occur. Model outcomes support continuation of working from home policies to reduce public transport use, and risk mitigation strategies in the context of social venues opening, such as >30% population-uptake of a contact-tracing app, physical distancing policies within venues reducing transmissibility by >40%, or patron identification records being kept to enable >60% contact tracing. Conclusions: In a low transmission setting, care should be taken to avoid lifting sequential COVID-19 policy restrictions within short time periods, as it could take more than two months to detect the consequences of any changes. These findings have implications for other settings with low community transmission where governments are beginning to lift restrictions.","Scott, N.; Palmer, A.; Delport, D.; Abeysuriya, R.; Stuart, R.; Kerr, C.

The increased affordability of animal protein for a greater proportion of the global population, in which antibiotic use has played a crucial part, has resulted in a substantial improvement in human quality of life. However, these benefits have come with major unintended consequences, including antibiotic resistance. Despite the inherent benefits of restricting antibiotic use in animal production, antibiotics remain essential to ensuring animal health, necessitating the development of novel approaches to replace the prophylactic and growth-promoting benefits of antibiotics. The third International Symposium on “Alternatives to Antibiotics: Challenges and Solutions in Animal Health and Production” in Bangkok, Thailand was organized by the USDA Agricultural Research Service, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University and Department of Livestock Development-Thailand Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperative; supported by OIE World Organization for Animal Health; and attended by more than 500 scientists from academia, industry, and government from 32 nations across 6 continents. The focus of the symposium was on ensuring human and animal health, food safety, and improving food animal production efficiency as well as quality. Attendees explored six subject areas in detail through scientific presentations and panel discussions with experts, and the major conclusions were as follows: (1) defining the mechanisms of action of antibiotic alternatives is paramount to enable their effective use, whether they are used for prevention, treatment, or to enhance health and production; (2) there is a need to integrate nutrition, health, and disease research, and host genetics needs to be considered in this regard; (3) a combination of alternatives to antibiotics may need to be considered to achieve optimum health and disease management in different animal production systems; (4) hypothesis-driven field trials with proper controls are needed to validate the safety, efficacy, and return of investment (ROI) of antibiotic alternatives.","Callaway, Todd R.; Lillehoj, Hyun; Chuanchuen, Rungtip; Gay, Cyril G.",Antibiotics (Basel),579,16

These days, in many settlements, the applicability of natural ventilation is limited in the face of the decreasing infiltration loads, increased atmospheric pollution, and the climatic conditions. Therefore, the use of mechanical systems that are designed to ensure proper ventilation is becoming widespread. This paper presents full-scale experimental research of a wall-integrated decentralized ventilation system with heat recovery in the laboratory conditions. The heat recovery unit includes a ceramic block for sensible thermal energy storage. Parametric experimental studies were carried out to obtain the temperature distributions and the thermal capacity of the ceramic block during the supply and exhaust modes of working. In order to simulate the winter and summer conditions, two large scale temperature-controlled rooms are built up. The duration of the ventilation period is varied to be 1, 2, 5, 7.5 and 10-minutes. Experimental measurements indicate that 2 minutes of operation time shows the best thermal performance in terms of maintaining a comfortable indoor temperature with the least energy consumption. And some shortcomings were observed about the fan and thermal storage limitations.","Pekdogan, Tugce; Tokuç, Ayça; Ezan, Mehmet Akif; Başaran, Tahsin",,579,22

PURPOSE: To provide a detailed set of guidelines developed in a surgical ward at University Hospital Wuerzburg to safely accommodate the exponentially rising cases of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients without compromising the care of emergency surgery and oncological patients or jeopardizing the well-being of hospital staff. CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic prioritization of SARS-CoV-2 infected and surgical patient groups is key to preserving life while maintaining high surgical standards. Strictly segregating patient groups in emergency rooms, non-intensive care wards and operating areas prevents viral spread while adequately training and carefully selecting hospital staff allow them to confidently and successfully undertake their respective clinical duties.","Flemming, S.; Hankir, M.; Ernestus, R.-I.; Seyfried, F.; Germer, C.-T.; Meybohm, P.; Wurmb, T.; Vogel, U.; Wiegering, A.",Langenbecks Arch Surg,579,16

Here we focus on West Nile Virus (WNV), a mosquito borne pathogen, as a case study for spatial data visualization of environmental characteristics of a vector’s habitat alongside human demographic composition for understanding potential public health risks of infectious disease. Multiple efforts have attempted to predict WNV environmental risk, while others have documented factors related to human vulnerability to the disease. However, analytical modeling that combines the two is difficult due to the number of potential explanatory variables, varying spatial resolutions of available data, and differing research questions that drove the initial data collection. We propose that the use of geovisualization may provide a glimpse into the large number of potential variables influencing the disease and help distill them into a smaller number that might reveal hidden and unknown patterns. This geovisual look at the data might then guide development of analytical models that can combine environmental and socio-economic data. METHODS: Geovisualization was used to integrate an environmental model of the disease vector’s habitat alongside human risk factors derived from socio-economic variables. County level WNV incidence rates from California, USA, were used to define a geographically constrained study area where environmental and socio-economic data were extracted from 1,133 census tracts. A previously developed mosquito habitat model that was significantly related to WNV infected dead birds was used to describe the environmental components of the study area. Self-organizing maps found 49 clusters, each of which contained census tracts that were more similar to each other in terms of WNV environmental and socio-economic data. Parallel coordinate plots permitted visualization of each cluster’s data, uncovering patterns that allowed final census tract mapping exposing complex spatial patterns contained within the clusters. RESULTS: Our results suggest that simultaneously visualizing environmental and socio-economic data supports a fuller understanding of the underlying spatial processes for risks to vector-borne disease. Unexpected patterns were revealed in our study that would be useful for developing future multilevel analytical models. For example, when the cluster that contained census tracts with the highest median age was examined, it was determined that those census tracts only contained moderate mosquito habitat risk. Likewise, the cluster that contained census tracts with the highest mosquito habitat risk had populations with moderate median age. Finally, the cluster that contained census tracts with the highest WNV human incidence rates had unexpectedly low mosquito habitat risk.","Kala, Abhishek K.; Atkinson, Samuel F.; Tiwari, Chetan",PeerJ,579,26

However, epidemiologically these outbreaks are not well defined. We aimed to define such outbreaks in ACFs by systematically reviewing literature published during the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We searched 11 bibliographic databases for literature published on COVID-19 in ACFs between December 2019 and September 2020. Original studies reporting extractable epidemiological data as part of outbreak investigations or non-outbreak surveillance of ACFs were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020211424. FINDINGS: We identified 5,148 publications and selected 49 studies from four continents reporting data on 214,380 residents in 8,502 ACFs with 25,567 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Aged care residents form a distinct vulnerable population with single-facility attack rates of 45% [95% CI 32–58%] and case fatality rates of 23% [95% CI 18–28%]. Of the cases, 31% [95% CI 28–34%] were asymptomatic. The rate of hospitalization amongst residents was 37% [95% CI 35–39%]. Data from 21 outbreaks identified a resident as the index case in 58% of outbreaks and a staff member in 42%. Findings from the included studies were heterogeneous and of low to moderate quality in risk of bias assessment. INTERPRETATION: The clinical presentation of COVID-19 varies widely in ACFs residents, from asymptomatic to highly serious cases. Preventing the introduction of COVID-19 into ACFs is key, and both residents and staff are a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination. Rapid diagnosis, identification of primary and secondary cases and close contacts plus their isolation and quarantine are of paramount importance.

This prescription has been used to treat patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Hypothesis/Purpose. We hypothesized that QPD would have beneficial effects on patients with COVID-19. We aimed to prove this hypothesis by evaluating the efficacy of QPD in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, we identified eligible participants who received a laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 between January 15 and March 15, 2020, in the west campus of Union Hospital in Wuhan, China. QPD was supplied as an oral liquid packaged in 200-mL containers, and patients were orally administered one package twice daily 40 minutes after a meal. The primary outcome was death, which was compared between patients who did and did not receive QPD (QPD and NoQPD groups, respectively). Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to identify cohorts. RESULTS: In total, 239 and 522 participants were enrolled in the QPD and NoQPD groups, respectively. After PSM at a 1 : 1 ratio, 446 patients meeting the criteria were included in the analysis with 223 in each arm. In the QPD and NoQPD groups, 7 (3.2%) and 29 (13.0%) patients died, and those in the QPD group had a significantly lower risk of death (hazard ratio (HR) 0.29, 95% CI: 0.13–0.67) than those in the NoQPD group (p = 0.004). Furthermore, the survival time was significantly longer in the QPD group than in the NoQPD group (p < 0.001).

Based on variant types, eight clades have already been defined in GISAID, but the diversity can be far greater. Owing to the explosive increase in available sequences, it is important to develop new technologies that can easily grasp the whole picture of the big-sequence data and support efficient knowledge discovery. An ability to efficiently clarify the detailed time-series changes in genome-wide mutation patterns will enable us to promptly identify and characterize dangerous variants that rapidly increase their population frequency. Here, we collectively analyzed over 150,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes to understand their overall features and time-dependent changes using a batch-learning self-organizing map (BLSOM) for oligonucleotide composition, which is an unsupervised machine learning method. BLSOM can separate clades defined by GISAID with high precision, and each clade is subdivided into clusters, which shows a differential increase/decrease pattern based on geographic region and time. This allowed us to identify prevalent strains in each region and to show the commonality and diversity of the prevalent strains. Comprehensive characterization of the oligonucleotide composition of SARS-CoV-2 and elucidation of time-series trends of the population frequency of variants can clarify the viral adaptation processes after invasion into the human population and the time-dependent trend of prevalent epidemic strains across various regions, such as continents.","Abe, Takashi; Furukawa, Ryuki; Iwasaki, Yuki; Ikemura, Toshimichi",bioRxiv,579,21

Exacerbation (EACOPD) is defined as an acute episode of clinical instability characterized by a sustained worsening of respiratory symptoms. It is necessary to distinguish a new EACOPD from a previous treatment failure or a relapse. EACOPD become more frequent and intense over time, deteriorating lung function and quality of life. The diagnosis of EACOPD consists of 3 essential steps: a) differential diagnosis; b) establish the severity, and c) identify its etiology. The main cause of exacerbations is infection, both bacterial and viral. Antibiotics are especially indicated in severe EACOPD and the presence of purulent sputum. Beta-lactams (amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefditoren) and fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin) are the most widely used antimicrobials.

Computational approaches including deep learning systems can play an important role in the identification of vaccine targets using genomic and proteomic information. Here, we present a new computational system to discover and analyse novel vaccine targets leading to the design of a multi-epitope subunit vaccine candidate. The system incorporates reverse vaccinology and immuno-informatics tools to screen genomic and proteomic datasets of several pathogens such as Trypanosoma cruzi, Plasmodium falciparum, and Vibrio cholerae to identify potential vaccine candidates (PVC). Further, as a case study, we performed a detailed analysis of the genomic and proteomic dataset of T. cruzi (CL Brenner and Y strain) to shortlist eight proteins as possible vaccine antigen candidates using properties such as secretory/surface-exposed nature, low transmembrane helix (< 2), essentiality, virulence, antigenic, and non-homology with host/gut flora proteins. Subsequently, highly antigenic and immunogenic MHC class I, MHC class II and B cell epitopes were extracted from top-ranking vaccine targets.

Macroalgae are a bio-diverse group distributed worldwide, known to produce multiple compounds of diverse chemical nature, different to those produced by terrestrial plants. These novel compounds have shown promising health benefits when incorporated into foods, including antimicrobial properties. This review aims to provide an overview of the general methods and novel compounds with antimicrobial properties recently isolated and characterized from macroalgae, emphasizing the molecular pathways of their antimicrobial mechanisms of action. The current scientific evidence on the use of macroalgae or macroalgal extracts to increase the shelf-life of foods and prevent the development of foodborne pathogens in real food products and their influence on the sensory attributes of multiple foods (i.e., meat, dairy, beverages, fish and bakery products) will also be discussed, together with the main challenges and future trends of the use of marine natural products as antimicrobials.","Cabral, Eduarda M.; Oliveira, Márcia; Mondala, Julie R.

SARS was identified in Hong Kong in late February 2003 and the WHO issued a global alert on 12 March, 2003. The incubation period of SARS is usually 4–6 days and patients commonly present with high fever (temperature >38°C), dry cough, chills and rigor, dyspnoea and diarrhoea. Although a specific antiviral agent and vaccines for SARS are not available at the time of writing, a standard treatment protocol for SARS has been developed. The average mortality rate is about 16% in Hong Kong. The coronavirus is a common pathogen for upper respiratory tract infection and is the most probable pathogen for SARS. Transmission methods may, therefore, be similar for both these infections. Transmission is possible when aerosolised viral particles come into contact with the susceptible host’s mucous membrane, most commonly the nose, but also the mouth and eyes. With appropriate preventive measures to avoid contact with virus, the probability of infection is minimal. Isolation of those who have had close contact with confirmed or suspected SARS patients and/or who have persistent fever will be the most effective and practical method of avoiding contact. Maintaining personal hygiene and frequent hand washing can also reduce the risk of infection. Using diluted bleach (1 part bleach in 99 parts water) to cleanse training areas and equipment is also recommended. With proper event planning to conform with quarantine measures, special travel arrangements, facility sterilisation and use of venues with good ventilation and filtering systems, sport competition can still proceed.","So, Raymond C.

However, neither of these hypotheses accounts for the age-distribution of severe cases and deaths, or for the geographic and other variations in rates and explosiveness of mortality during the Pandemic. It will be shown here that, alternatively, the epidemiology of the influenza lethality could be completely explained by a combination of two determinants: (1) acquired immune-differentiation of birth-cohorts, within populations, through developmental epigenetic adaptation (and selection) secondary to maternal or early-life episodes of influenza infection and (2) a triggering context – emergence of a new sub-type/strain, and its co-circulation (competition?) with seasonal viruses immunologically related to ones that had circulated in the past and primed particular population birth-cohorts. This article (1) presents age, geographic, and temporal variations in 1918–1919 and 2009 influenza severity, (2) presents and discusses ecologic evidence in favor of the hypothesis to influenza lethality advanced here, (3) suggests biologic mechanisms capable of explaining it, (4) retrospectively, proposes co-circulation between the Pandemic and a 1918 seasonal (H3?) influenza virus as the context for the increased lethality during the second wave of the 1918 Pandemic, and (5) predicts an increase in influenza severity in the northern hemisphere as the 2009–2010 season advances and H3 circulation increases.","Azambuja, M.I.",Med Hypotheses,579,26

The island of Hispaniola, which the Dominican Republic shares with Haiti, accounts for approximately 90% of LF cases in the Americas region. In 1998, the Dominican Ministry of Public Health created the Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (PELF) with the goal of eliminating LF transmission by 2020. Baseline mapping revealed 19 (12% of total) endemic municipalities clustered into three geographic foci (Southwest, La Ciénaga and East), with a total at-risk population of 262,395 people. Beginning in 2002, PELF sequentially implemented mass drug administration (MDA) in these foci using albendazole and diethylcarbamazine (DEC). In total, 1,174,050 treatments were given over three to five annual rounds of house-to-house MDA per focus with a median coverage of 81.7% (range 67.4%–92.2%). By 2018, LF antigen prevalence was less than 2% in all foci, thus meeting criteria to stop MDA and begin post-treatment surveillance (PTS). This success has been achieved against a shifting landscape of limited domestic funding, competing domestic public health priorities, and sporadic external donor support. Remaining steps include the need to scale-up morbidity management and disability prevention services for LF and to continue PTS until LF transmission is interrupted across Hispaniola.","Gonzales, Manuel; Noland, Gregory S.; Mariano, Eileen F.; Blount, Stephen",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,579,16

Studying the impact of such extraordinary circumstances on their well-being is crucial to identify processes leading to risk and resilience. To better understand how Spanish children have adapted to the stressful disruptions resulting from the pandemic outbreak, we examined the effects of child coping and its interactions with contextual stressors (pandemic and family related) on child adjustment, incorporating in our analysis a developmental perspective. Data was collected in April 2020, through parent-reports, during the acute phase of the pandemic and, temporarily coinciding with the mandatory national quarantine period imposed by the Spanish Government. A sample of 1,123 Spanish children (50% girls) aged 3 to 12 (Mage = 7.26; SD = 2.39) participated in the study. Results showed differences in the use of specific strategies by children in different age groups (i.e., 3–6, 7–9 and 10–12-year-olds). Despite the uncontrollable nature of the pandemic-related stressors, child disengagement coping was distinctively associated to negative outcomes (i.e., higher levels of behavioral and emotional difficulties), whereas engagement coping predicted psychosocial adjustment across all age groups. Moreover, interactively with child coping, parent fear of the future and parent dispositional resilience appear as relevant contextual factors to predict both negative and positive outcomes, but their effects seem to be age dependent, suggesting a higher contextual vulnerability for younger children. These findings might have implications for identifying individual and contextual risk and informing potential preventive interventions aimed to reduce the impact of future pandemic outbreaks on children of different ages.","Domínguez-Álvarez, Beatriz; López-Romero, Laura; Isdahl-Troye, Aimé; Gómez-Fraguela, Jose Antonio; Romero, Estrella",Front Psychol,579,20

Historically, conventional treatments for sarcomatoid RCCs (sRCCs) have shown little efficacy, and median survival is commonly 6–13 months. Despite being first described in 1968, the mechanisms driving sarcomatoid dedifferentiation remain poorly understood, and information and treatment options available to physicians and patients are limited. When diagnosed at an early stage, surgical intervention remains the treatment of choice. However, preoperative identification through routine imaging or biopsy is unreliable and most patients present with advanced disease and systemic symptoms. For these patients, the role of cytoreductive nephrectomy is disputed. The expansion of immunotherapies approved for RCCs has generated a search for biomarkers that might be indicative of treatment response in sRCCs, although a proven effective systemic agent remains elusive. PDL1 expression is increased in sarcomatoid dedifferentiated renal tumours, which suggests that patients with sRCCs could benefit from PD1 and/or PDL1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Treatment outcomes for sarcomatoid tumours have remained relatively consistent compared with other RCCs, but further investigation of the tumour–immune cell microenvironment might yield insights into further therapeutic possibilities.","Blum, Kyle A.; Gupta, Sounak; Tickoo, Satish K.; Chan, Timothy A.; Russo, Paul; Motzer, Robert J.; Karam, Jose A.; Hakimi, A.

METHODS: Central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), ventilator-associated events (VAEs), select surgical site infections, and Clostridioides difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia laboratory-identified events reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network for 2019 and 2020 by acute-care hospitals were analyzed. SIRs were calculated for each HAI and quarter by dividing the number of reported infections by the number of predicted infections, calculated using 2015 national baseline data. Percentage changes between 2019 and 2020 SIRs were calculated. Supporting analyses, such as an assessment of device utilization in 2020 compared to 2019, were also performed. RESULTS: Significant increases in the national SIRs for CLABSI, CAUTI, VAE, and MRSA bacteremia were observed in 2020. Changes in the SIR varied by quarter and state. The largest increase was observed for CLABSI, and significant increases in VAE incidence and ventilator utilization were seen across all 4 quarters of 2020.

METHODS: Clinical indicators of COVID-19 patients from two independent cohorts (Training data: Hefei Cohort, 82 patients; Validation data: Nanchang Cohort, 169 patients) were retrospected. Sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) using Hefei Cohort was performed and prediction models were deduced. Prediction results were evaluated by receiver operator characteristic curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) in above two cohorts. RESULTS: SPCA using Hefei Cohort revealed that the first 13 principal components (PCs) account for 80.8% of the total variance of original data. The PC1 and PC12 were significantly associated with disease severity with odds ratio of 4.049 and 3.318, respectively. They were used to construct prediction model, named Model-A. In disease severity prediction, Model-A gave the best prediction efficiency with area under curve (AUC) of 0.867 and 0.835 in Hefei and Nanchang Cohort, respectively. Model-A’s simplified version, named as LMN index, gave comparable prediction efficiency as classical clinical markers with AUC of 0.837 and 0.800 in training and validation cohort, respectively.

Methods: We used suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) and differential screening analysis to profile the mRNA expression patterns of children with CD and age‐ and sex‐matched controls without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Results: Sequence analysis of 1000 clones enriched by SSH identified 75 functionally annotated human genes, represented by 430 clones. The 75 genes have potential involvement in gene networks, such as antigen presentation, inflammation, infection mechanism, connective tissue development, cell cycle and cancer. Twenty‐eight genes were previously described in association with CD, while 47 were new genes not previously reported in the context of IBD. Additionally, 29 of the 75 genes have been previously implicated in bacterial and viral infections. Quantitative real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction performed on ileal‐derived RNA from 13 CD and nine non‐IBD patients confirmed the upregulation of extracellular matrix gene MMP2 (P = 0.001), and cell proliferation gene REG1A (P = 0.063) in our pediatric CD cohort. Conclusion: The retrieval of 28 genes previously reported in association with adult CD emphasizes the importance of these genes in the pediatric setting. The observed upregulation of REG1A and MMP2, and their known impact on cell proliferation and extracellular matrix remodeling, agrees with the clinical behavior of the disease. Moreover, the expressions of bacterial‐ and virus‐related genes in our CD‐patient tissues support the concept that microbial agents are important in the etiopathogenesis of CD.","Sim, Winnie H; Wagner, Josef; Cameron, Donald J; Catto‐Smith, Anthony G; Bishop, Ruth F; Kirkwood, Carl D",J Gastroenterol Hepatol,579,24

Antivirals against coronaviruses do not exist, hence global drug re-purposing efforts have been carried out to identify agents that may provide clinical benefit to patients with COVID-19. Itraconazole, an antifungal agent, has been reported to have potential activity against animal coronaviruses. Methods Using cell-based phenotypic assays, the in vitro antiviral activity of itraconazole and 17-OH itraconazole was assessed against clinical isolates from a German and Belgian patient infected with SARS-CoV-2. Results Itraconazole demonstrated antiviral activity in human Caco-2 cells (EC50 = 2.3 μM; MTT assay). Similarly, its primary metabolite, 17-OH itraconazole, showed inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 activity (EC50 = 3.6 μM). Remdesivir inhibited viral replication with an EC50 = 0.4 μM. Itraconazole and 17-OH itraconazole resulted in a viral yield reduction in vitro of approximately 2-log10 and approximately 1-log10, as measured in both Caco-2 cells and VeroE6-eGFP cells, respectively. The viral yield reduction brought about by remdesivir or GS-441524 (parent nucleoside of the antiviral prodrug remdesivir; positive control) was more pronounced, with an approximately 3 log10 drop and >4 log10 drop in Caco-2 cells and VeroE6-eGFP cells, respectively. Discussion Itraconazole and 17-OH itraconazole exert in vitro low micromolar activity against SARS-CoV-2.

The potential utility of itolizumab in COVID-19, based on its unique mechanism of action in ameliorating cytokine release syndrome (CRS), was proposed first in Cuba with approval of a single-arm clinical trial and expanded access use. Subsequently, a phase II, open-label, randomized, placebo-controlled trial has been conducted in 30 COVID-19 patients in India after receiving regulatory permission.

Probability of PPIs determines the binding affinity of hACE2 genetic variants with RBD was investigated. Composition variations at the hACE2 and RBD were processed for PatchDock and refined by FireDock for the PPIs. Twelve nsSNPs were identified as the top pathogenic from SNPs (n = 7489) in hACE2 using eight bioinformatics tools. Eight RBD variants were complexed with 12 nSNPS of hACE2, and the global energy scores (Kcal/mol) were calculated and classified as very weak (–3.93 to −18.43), weak (–18.42 to −32.94), moderate (–32.94 to −47.44), strong (–47.44 to −61.95) and very strong (–61.95 to −76.46) zones. Seven composition variants in the very strong zone [G726R-G476S; R768W-V367F; Y252N-V483A; Y252N-V367F; G726R-V367F; N720D-V367F and N720D-F486L], and three in very weak [P263S-S383C; RBD-H378R; G726R-A348T] are significantly (p < 0.00001) varied for global energy score. Zonation of the five zones was established based on the scores to differentiate the effect of hACE2 and RBD variants on the binding affinity. Moreover, our findings support that the combination of hACE2 and RBD is key players for the risk of infection that should be done by further laboratory studies. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Here, we evaluate nafamostat mesylate, a potent broad‐spectrum serine protease inhibitor that blocks host protease activation of the viral spike protein. SARS‐CoV‐2 is used to infect human polarized mucociliated primary bronchiolar epithelia reconstituted with cells derived from healthy donors, smokers and subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Nafamostat markedly inhibits apical shedding of SARS‐CoV‐2 from all donors (log(10) reduction). We also observe, for the first‐time, anti‐inflammatory effects of nafamostat on airway epithelia independent of its antiviral effects, suggesting a dual therapeutic advantage in the treatment of COVID‐19. Nafamostat also exhibits antiviral properties against the seasonal human coronaviruses 229E and NL6. These findings suggest therapeutic promise for nafamostat in treating SARS‐CoV‐2 and other human coronaviruses.","Niemeyer, Brian F.; Miller, Caitlin M.; Ledesma‐Feliciano, Carmen; Morrison, James H.; Jimenez‐Valdes, Rocio; Clifton, Clarissa; Poeschla, Eric M.; Benam, Kambez H.",Nano Sel,579,16

These specialized microdomains interact in a cis manner with various immune receptors, affecting immune receptor-mediated signaling. This, in turn, results in the regulation of a broad range of immunological functions, including phagocytosis, cytokine production, antigen presentation and apoptosis. In addition, GSLs alone can regulate immunological functions by acting as ligands for immune receptors, and exogenous GSLs can alter the organization of microdomains and microdomain-associated signaling. Many pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and fungi, enter host cells by binding to GSL-enriched microdomains. Intracellular pathogens survive inside phagocytes by manipulating intracellular microdomain-driven signaling and/or sphingolipid metabolism pathways. This review describes the mechanisms by which GSL-enriched microdomains regulate immune signaling.","Yokoyama, Noriko; Hanafusa, Kei; Hotta, Tomomi; Oshima, Eriko; Iwabuchi, Kazuhisa; Nakayama, Hitoshi",Int J Mol Sci,579,33

There is no conclusive evidence about ocular manifestations of the new coronavirus infection, but cases of conjunctivitis, keratitis, and episcleritis have been reported in infected individuals. OBJECTIVE: Determining if wearing a face mask during COVID-19 pandemic causes a new onset or deterioration of previously existing dry eye disease (DED). METHODS: A prospective cohort study included 203 participants, all using surgical facemasks daily due to new regulations during COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed a survey, containing modified Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire. They were divided into groups according to: sex, age, duration of face mask-wear, and existence of prior DED history. RESULTS: Our results indicate that women have a statistically higher OSDI score compared to men (14.4 (IQR = 2.4 – 41.7) vs. 5.0 (IQR = 0.0 – 24.4); P = .004). Age did not significantly affect OSDI median values. Group that used masks from 3 to 6 hours/day demonstrated significantly higher OSDI scores compared to <3 hour/day group (15.3 (IQR = 8.3 – 47.7) vs. 8.3 (IQR = 0.0 – 35.1); P = .001). OSDI score was significantly greater in participants with prior DED history compared to those without it (36.1 (IQR = 14.1 – 61.6) vs. 4.2 (IQR = 2.3 – 8.3); P <.001). Participants with prior DED exhibited greater worsening of their disturbances during mask wearing period compared to the ones without previous DED (54.8% vs. 17.7%, Chi-Square 28.3 DF1; P <.001), regardless of daily mask wear duration. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the existence of mask-associated dry eye (MADE), most profoundly in females, subjects with a history of prior DED, and if wearing a face mask lasts longer than 3 hours per day. Ophthalmologists should advise their patients of the potential ocular surface health risks related to inadequately fitted facemasks.","Krolo, Iva; Blazeka, Matija; Merdzo, Ivan; Vrtar, Izabela; Sabol, Ivan; Petric-Vickovic, Ivanka",Med Arch,579,16

A subset of COVID-19 patients present with ST-elevations on electrocardiogram (ECG) yet normal coronary angiography, a presentation that can fit criteria for myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary atherosclerosis (MINOCA). There is little known about non-coronary myocardial injury observed in patients with COVID-19, and we present a case that should encourage further conversation and study of this clinical challenge. CASE SUMMARY: An 86-year-old man presented to our institution with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and an ECG showing anteroseptal ST-segment elevation concerning for myocardial infarction. Mechanic ventilation was initiated prior to presentation, and emergent transthoracic echocardiography reported an ejection fraction of 50–55%, with no significant regional wall motion abnormalities. Next, emergent coronary angiography was performed, and no significant coronary artery disease was detected. The patient tested positive for COVID-19. Despite supportive management in the intensive care unit, the patient passed away. DISCUSSION: We present a case of COVID-19 that is likely associated with MINOCA. It is crucial to understand that in COVID-19 patients with signs of myocardial infarction, not all myocardial injury is due to obstructive coronary artery disease. In the case of COVID-19 pathophysiology, it is important to consider the cardiovascular effects of hypoxic respiratory failure, potential myocarditis, and significant systemic inflammation. Continued surveillance and research on the cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 is essential to further elucidate management and prognosis.","Meizinger, Casey; Klugherz, Bruce",Eur Heart J Case Rep,579,1

However, the only real prophylactic strategy against COVID-19 is still mass vaccination, which means to vaccinate infants and pregnant and lactating women. AREAS COVERED: This is a systematic review aiming to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant and lactating women and their newborns. We did advanced research on PubMed and Google Scholar, and searched for any evidence also on ClinicalTrials.gov. Results refer to a timeline going until 12 June 2021. EXPERT OPINION: Our efforts must be directed to vaccine more and more population groups which have been preliminarily excluded from the vaccination campaign. Studies have not so far highlighted plausible adverse effects in vaccinated pregnant women or in their newborns. Reactogenicity across lactating and pregnant women does not seem to differ from general population. Likewise, abortion rate does not differ from non-vaccinated pregnant women studied before the COVID-19 pandemic. It also seems that a major amount of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins is transferred through the placenta and the breastmilk to the newborn, providing humoral immunity.","Falsaperla, Raffaele; Leone, Guido; Familiari, Maria; Ruggieri, Martino",Expert review of vaccines,579,16

This study analyzed what motivational variables predicted the self-efficacy and commitment to sports practice, as well as the differences according to gender, during lockdown and the progressive de-escalation caused by COVID-19, using the theory of self-determination as a theoretical framework. The study sample was conformed of 179 subjects (90 men and 89 women) between 18 and 65 years of age (M = 28.64; SD = 10.28). The Behavioral Regulation in Sport Questionnaire (BRSQ), the Psychological Need Satisfaction in Exercise Scale (PNSE), the Physical Activity Self-Efficacy scale, and the Sport Commitment scale were applied. The most relevant results have showed significant differences in favor of the male gender in terms of levels of controlled motivation and amotivation, as well as higher levels of self-efficacy and basic psychological need of autonomy. Furthermore, the regression analysis has revealed that self-efficacy and current commitment to sports practice were explained by a variance of 57 and 64%, respectively, due to autonomous motivation and the basic psychological need of competence. Therefore, the basic psychological need of competence should be fostered in order to increase the levels of self-determined motivation, self-efficacy, and commitment to sports practice of the population.","Leyton-Román, Marta; de la Vega, Ricardo; Jiménez-Castuera, Ruth",Front Psychol,579,20

METHODS: The study included 660 COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed positive pediatric patients (aged 3–15 years) diagnosed at King Abdullah Specialist Children Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Data were retrospectively retrieved from January to July 2020 from electronic medical records and included patients' epidemiological and clinical features. Patients were then followed-up via phone calls to document any symptoms encountered after the first visit. Patients were categorized into three main groups according to age (3-6 years, 7-10 years, 11-15 years). RESULTS: Nearly half of the patients (43.6%) had asymptomatic infections. Fever and cough were the most commonly reported manifestations accounting for 39.2% and 19.8%, respectively. The most frequently reported otolaryngology symptoms were sore throat (17.3%) and rhinorrhea (14.4%). Moreover, 10.4% and 13.1% of children aged 7-15 years old experienced smell and taste disturbances, respectively.

The onset of acute enteritis is associated with infection by viruses that replicate at or near the site of entry into the intestinal mucosa, including caliciviruses, rotaviruses, adenoviruses, astroviruses, and coronaviruses. These ‘enteric’ viruses occur globally and share similar features. Most are RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of mature absorptive epithelial cells lining the villi of the small intestine, leading to inflammation and villus atrophy. Vomiting and diarrhea can result in dehydration and death if untreated. Despite abundant growth in vivo, they initially proved difficult or impossible to grow in vitro. Most are genetically diverse, species specific, highly infectious within species and transmitted by the fecal–oral route. Severe symptoms are most commonly associated with primary infections of young animals, and are followed by short-lived immunity. Reinfections are common throughout life, but are often only mildly symptomatic. Safe and effective vaccines have been developed to prevent severe rotavirus disease in young children. In addition to these enterotropic viruses, enteric disease can also result from spread to the intestine of HIV or cytomegaloviruses during the later stages of systemic disease in immunocompromised hosts.","Bishop, R.F.; Kirkwood, C.D.",Encyclopedia of Virology,579,31

Of 65 case-patients identified with MERS-CoV infection, 27 (42%) had healthcare-associated cases. Epidemiologic and genetic sequencing findings suggest that 3 healthcare clusters of MERS-CoV infection occurred, including 1 that resulted in 20 infected persons in 1 hospital. MERS-CoV in healthcare settings spread predominantly before MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed, underscoring the importance of increasing awareness and infection control measures at first points of entry to healthcare facilities.","Hunter, Jennifer C.; Nguyen, Duc; Aden, Bashir; Al Bandar, Zyad; Al Dhaheri, Wafa; Abu Elkheir, Kheir; Khudair, Ahmed; Al Mulla, Mariam; El Saleh, Feda; Imambaccus, Hala; Al Kaabi, Nawal; Sheikh, Farrukh Amin; Sasse, Jurgen; Turner, Andrew; Abdel Wareth, Laila; Weber, Stefan; Al Ameri, Asma; Abu Amer, Wesal; Alami, Negar N.; Bunga, Sudhir; Haynes, Lia M.; Hall, Aron J.; Kallen, Alexander J.; Kuhar, David; Pham, Huong; Pringle, Kimberly; Tong, Suxiang; Whitaker, Brett L.; Gerber, Susan I.; Al Hosani, Farida Ismail",Emerg Infect Dis,579,22

It can help to craft appropriate public health responses, develop solutions to the epidemic impacts and improve understanding of why the epidemic occurred. Yet, there are practical constraints in undertaking this international research in a way that produces quality, ethical and appropriate data, and that values all voices and experiences, especially those of local researchers and research participants. In this paper, we reflected on the experience of undertaking social science research during the 2015/2016 Zika epidemic in Brazil. This experience was considered from the perspective of this paper’s authors: three Brazilian academics, two UK academics and two mothers of children affected by congenital Zika syndrome. This group came together through the conduct of the Social and Economic Impact of Zika study, a mixed-methods social science study. The key findings highlight practical issues in the achievement of three goals: the conduct of high-quality social science in emergencies and efforts towards the decolonisation of global health in terms of levelling the power between Brazilian and UK researchers and optimising the role of patients within research. From our perspective, the information collected through social science was valuable, providing detailed insight into the programmatic needs of mothers and their affected children (eg, economic and social support and mental health services). Social science was considered a low priority within the Zika epidemic despite its potential importance. There were logistical challenges in conducting social science research, foremost of which are the difficulties in developing a trusting and balanced power relationship between the UK and Brazilian researchers in a short time frame. When these issues were overcome, each partner brought unique qualities, making the research stronger. The mothers of affected children expressed dissatisfaction with research, as they were involved in many studies which were not coordinated, and from which they did not see a benefit. In conclusion, the importance of social science in epidemics must continue to be promoted by funders. Funders can also set in place mechanisms to help equalise the power dynamics between foreign and local researchers, researchers and participants, both to promote justice and to create best quality data.","Passos, Maria Joana; Matta, Gustavo; Lyra, Tereza Maciel; Moreira, Maria Elisabeth Lopes; Kuper, Hannah; Penn-Kekana, Loveday; Mendonça, Mila",BMJ Glob Health,579,24

In this study, salivary samples of COVID-19 patients collected from 6 patients with the median age of 58.5 years, ranging from 34 to 72 years (2 females and 4 males) were analyzed using an Au/fiber Bragg grating (FBG) probe decorated with GO. The probe measures the prevalence of positivity in saliva and the association between the virus density and changes to sensing elements. When the probe is immersed in patients’ saliva, deviation of the detected light wavelength and intensity from healthy saliva indicate the presence of the virus and confirms infection. For a patient in the hyperinflammatory phase of desease, who has virus density of 1.2 × 10(8) copies/mL in saliva, the maximum wavelength shift and intensity changes after 1600 s were shown to be 1.12 nm and 2.01 dB, respectively. While for a patient in the early infection phase with 1.6 × 10(3) copies/mL, these values were 0.98 nm and 1.32 dB. The precise and highly sensitive FBG probe proposed in this study was found a reliable tool for quick detection of the COVID-19 virus within 10 s after exposure to patients’ saliva in any stage of the disease.","Samavati, Alireza; Samavati, Zahra; Velashjerdi, M.; Fauzi Ismail, Ahmad; Othman, M.H.D.; Eisaabadi B, G.; Sohaimi Abdullah, Mohd; Bolurian, Marzieh; Bolurian, Mohammadreza",Chem Eng J,579,16

They are determined, at least in part, by the intrinsic physicochemical properties of amino acids and may be reflected in the protein three-dimensional structure. Modeling mutational effects on biochemical phenotypes is a critical step for understanding protein function and disease mechanism as well as enabling drug discovery. Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) experiments have been performed on SARS-CoV-2’s spike receptor binding domain and the human ACE2 zinc-binding peptidase domain – both central players in viral infection and evolution and antibody evasion - quantifying how mutations impact binding affinity and protein expression. Here, we modeled biochemical phenotypes from massively parallel assays, using convolutional neural networks trained on protein sequence mutations in the virus and human host. We found that neural networks are significantly predictive of binding affinity, protein expression, and antibody escape, learning complex interactions and higher-order features that are difficult to capture with conventional methods from structural biology. Integrating the intrinsic physicochemical properties of amino acids, including hydrophobicity, solvent-accessible surface area, and long-range non-bonded energy per atom, significantly improved prediction (empirical p<0.01) though there was such a strong dependence on the sequence data alone to yield reasonably good prediction. We observed concordance of the DMS data and our neural network predictions with an independent study on intermolecular interactions from molecular dynamics (multiple 500 ns or 1 μs all-atom) simulations of the spike protein-ACE2 interface, with critical implications for the use of deep learning to dissect molecular mechanisms. The mutation- or genetically- determined component of a biochemical phenotype estimated from the neural networks has improved causal inference properties relative to the original phenotype and can facilitate crucial insights into disease pathophysiology and therapeutic design.","Wang, Bo; Gamazon, Eric R.",bioRxiv,579,16

In the aftermath of the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, initial data raised concerns that ACE/ARB use can increase the expression of ACE2 receptors, leading to the worsening of COVID-19. However, recent studies have suggested that their use might be safe in a select subgroup of patients. We conducted a single-center retrospective study to evaluate the association of in-patient use of ACE/ARB with outcomes among a predominantly ethnic minority patient population of the inner New York City (NYC). Methods This was a retrospective analysis of all hospital admissions with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020, to March 31, 2020. Results Of the 469 patients included in the study, 91 patients (19.4%) used ACE/ARB therapy during their hospital stay and were labeled as ACE/ARB group. Patients in the ACE/ARB therapy group were older and had a higher incidence of HTN, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure, DM, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Admission D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were similar between the two groups, but absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was lower in the non-ACE/ARB group (0.971 k/ul vs. 1.135 k/ul, p=0.0144). The incidence of hyperkalemia and the rise in creatinine were similar between the two groups. Univariate analysis by treatment group using the log-rank test produced significant results (p=0.0062), indicating a higher survival rate for the ACE/ARB group. Conclusion The use of ACE/ARB appears to be safe in all patients in whom their use is medically indicated.","Adrish, Muhammad; Chilimuri, Sridhar; Sun, Haozhe; Mantri, Nikhitha; Yugay, Alla; Zahid, Maleeha",Cureus,579,20

Little is known about the effects of feeding those forage brassicas to lactating cows on cheese nutritional characteristics. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of including kale or swedes in the diet of pasture-fed lactating dairy cows on chemical composition, fatty acid (FA) profile and sensory characteristics of Chanco-style cheese. Kale or swedes can be used in the diet of pasture-fed lactating dairy cows without negative effects on milk production, milk composition and cheese composition. However, with regard to cheese FA profiles, those elaborated from milks from kale and swedes increased total contents of saturated fatty acids. ABSTRACT: Brassica crops such as kale and swede can be supplied to cow diets during winter, however little is known about the effects of feeding those forage brassicas to lactating cows on cheese nutritional characteristics of milk and cheese. This study evaluated the effect of including kale or swede in pasture-fed lactating dairy cow diets on chemical composition, fatty acid (FA) profile, and sensory characteristics of Chanco-style cheese. Twelve early-lactation cows were used in a replicated (n = 4) 3 × 3 square Latin square design. The control diet consisted of (DM basis) 10.0 kg of grass silage, 4.0 kg of fresh grass pasture, 1.5 kg soybean meal, 1.0 kg of canola meal, and 4.0 kg of cereal-based concentrate. The other treatments replaced 25% of the diet with swede or kale. Milk yield, milkfat, and milk protein were similar between treatments as were cheese moisture, fat, and protein. Swede and kale increased total saturated cheese FA while thrombogenic index was greater in swede, but color homogeneity and salty flavor were greater while ripe cheese aroma less than for kale. Kale or swede can be used in the diet of pasture-fed lactating dairy cows without negative effects on milk production, milk composition, or cheese composition. However, kale and swede increased total cheese saturated FA.","Vargas-Bello-Pérez, Einar; Geldsetzer-Mendoza, Carolina; Ibáñez, Rodrigo A.; Rodríguez, José Ramón; Alvarado-Gillis, Christian; Keim, Juan P.",Animals (Basel),579,29

Data from different surveys revealed a high degree of hesitation rather than outright opposition to vaccines. The most frequent complaint related to the COVID-19 vaccination was the fear of side effects. Within the Spanish and European legislative framework, both compulsory vaccination and government regulation of FN (Fake News) appear to be feasible options, counting on sufficient legal support, which could be reinforced by additional amendment. However, following current trends of good governance, policymakers must have public legitimation. Rather than compulsory COVID-19 vaccination, an approach based on education and truthful information, persuading the population of the benefits of a vaccine on a voluntary basis, is recommended. Disagreements between health professionals are positive, but they should be resolved following good practice and the procedures of the code of ethics. Furthermore, citizens do not support the involvement of government authorities in the direct control of news. Collaboration with the media and other organizations should be used instead.","Marco-Franco, Julio Emilio; Pita-Barros, Pedro; Vivas-Orts, David; González-de-Julián, Silvia; Vivas-Consuelo, David",Int J Environ Res Public Health,579,33

COVID-19 is known to have several, serious CNS-related consequences, but neuropsychological studies of severe COVID-19 are still rare. METHODS: M., a 45-year-old man, who survived a severe COVID-19 disease course including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), cerebral microbleeds, and 35 days of mechanical ventilation, is described. We elaborate on M’s recovery and rehabilitation process from onset to the 8-month follow-up. The cognitive functions were evaluated with a comprehensive screening battery at 4 weeks after extubation and at the 8-month follow-up. RESULTS: Following extubation, M. was delirious, reported visual hallucinations, and had severe sleeping difficulties. At about 3 months after COVID-19 onset, M. showed mild to moderate deficits on tests measuring processing speed, working memory, and attention. At assessments at 8 months, M. performed better, with results above average on tests measuring learning, memory, word fluency, and visuospatial functions. Minor deficits were still found regarding logical reasoning, attention, executive functioning, and processing speed. There were no lingering psychiatric symptoms. While M. had returned to a part-time job, he was not able to resume previous work-tasks. CONCLUSION: This case-study demonstrates possible cognitive deficits after severe COVID-19 and emphasizes the need of a neuropsychological follow-up, with tests sensitive to minor deficits. The main findings of this report provide some support that the long-term prognosis for cognition in severe COVID-19 may be hopeful.","Backman, Linda; Möller, Marika C; Thelin, Eric P; Dahlgren, Daniel; Deboussard, Catharina; Östlund, Gunilla; Lindau, Maria",Arch Clin Neuropsychol,579,1

METHODS: From 23rd March, 2020 until 30th June, 2020 complete lockdown was imposed in India. During this period there was restructuring of cancer care and radiation oncology department due to operational policies prevalent in the institution, and the care for gynaecological cancer was based on the evolving international recommendations. Institutional review board approval was obtained to audit patterns of care during complete lockdown phase. Descriptive variables were used to report on patient characteristics, compliance, delays, toxicity and observed deviations in recommended care. RESULT: During the lockdown period spanning 100 days, treatment of 270 and telephonic follow-up of 1103 gyneconcological cancer patients was undertaken. Of 270 new patients, due to travel restrictions, 90 patients were referred to the facilities in vicinity of their residence. Of the remaining 180 patients, 138 were planned for complete treatment at our institution and 42 were referred to our centre for brachytherapy. Of 138 patients, only 106 (76%) completed the planned external radiation. Twenty four (26%), patients completed full course of concurrent chemotherapy, 11 (12%) received chemotherapy dose reduction and 57 (62%) received no concurrent chemotherapy. Treatment delay of upto 3 weeks noted in 8.6% patients due to COVID infection. No grade IV-V acute sequelae were observed. No excess adverse effects were observed in high risk population. Low rate of symptom burden was observed amongst 1103 patients on telephonic follow-up. with 100 (9.6%) patients reporting symptoms Amongst these, (54/100) 54% had complete resolution of symptoms within 4 weeks of teleconsultation, while 10% had disease progression. CONCLUSION: Low compliance to planned treatment was observed for radiation and concurrent chemotherapy due to lockdown and fear of contracting COVID, will likely lead to increased risk of cancer related mortality. Rapid restructuring of care is needed to prevent the same as COVID pandemic further evolves. SUMMARY: The current article provides a real world audit of treatment for gynecological cancers during the complete lockdown phase of COVID Pandemic within tertiary cancer centre in India. Unacceptable treatment delays were noted within the health care system primarily due to societal restrictions posed due to lockdown. No untoward adverse effects were noted as a direct result of COVID infection.

However, it can cause irreversible vision loss. Few cases have been reported in pediatric patient with HCQ-related adverse reactions. Appropriate administration and early disease recognition are important for reducing the adverse drug reactions of HCQ. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a case of a 14-year-old Chinese girl who sought treatment for rapidly decreasing vision in the left eye over 3 days. The simulation results of the population pharmacokinetic model of HCQ revealed that the plasma concentration of HCQ abnormally increased before the visual acuity of the eye decreased. DIAGNOSIS: She was diagnosed as HCQ related drug adverse reaction. INTERVENTIONS: The daily dose of HCQ for this patient was adjusted from 100 mg/d to 50 mg/d. OUTCOMES: Follow-up for 6 months showed no more vision loss recurrence. However, the existing decreased visual acuity of the eye did not recover either. CONCLUSION: Although decreased visual acuity is an infrequent symptom, ophthalmologists should be aware of the possibility of HCQ concentration enrichment and consider minimizing HCQ use when a child with renal hypofunction seeks treatment for shortsightedness.","Lu, Jinmiao; Huang, Yidie; Ye, Qiaofeng; Shang, Feineng; Ming, Mei; Xu, Hong; Li, Zhiping",Medicine (Baltimore),579,10

The model is simulated using data relevant to the dynamics of the diseases in Lagos, Nigeria, making predictions for the attainment of peak periods in the presence or absence of comorbidity. The model is shown to undergo the phenomenon of backward bifurcation caused by the parameter accounting for increased susceptibility to COVID‐19 infection by comorbid susceptibles as well as the rate of reinfection by those who have recovered from a previous COVID‐19 infection. Simulations of the cumulative number of active cases (including those with comorbidity), at different reinfection rates, show infection peaks reducing with decreasing reinfection of those who have recovered from a previous COVID‐19 infection. In addition, optimal control and cost‐effectiveness analysis of the model reveal that the strategy that prevents COVID‐19 infection by comorbid susceptibles is the most cost‐effective of all the control strategies for the prevention of COVID‐19.","Omame, Andrew; Sene, Ndolane; Nometa, Ikenna; Nwakanma, Cosmas I.; Nwafor, Emmanuel U.; Iheonu, Nneka O.; Okuonghae, Daniel",Optim Control Appl Methods,579,20
