In order to close this gap, the aim of this study is to determine the effects of technological innovation on both carbon emission and ecological footprint for big emerging markets (BEM) countries. In doing so, the environmental impacts of the financialization process are also explored, in line with the fact that these countries face constraints in financing technological developments. In this context, the effects of technological development, financialization, renewable energy consumption, and non-renewable energy consumption on environmental degradation are examined through the second-generation panel data methods for the period 1995-2016. The findings indicate that technological innovation is effective in reducing carbon emissions, but does not have a significant impact on the ecological footprint, namely a 1% increase in technological innovations reduces carbon emission by 0.082-0.088%. Moreover, it is found that financialization harms environmental quality for both indicators of the environment because a 1% increase in financialization increases carbon emissions by 0.203-0.222% and increases ecological footprint by 0.069-0.071%.","Destek, Mehmet Akif; Manga, Muge",,967,1

296866,296866,296866,6th World Congress of PGHAN: Abstracts,18.930916,14.26791,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak is now a pandemic disease reaching as much as 210 countries worldwide with more than 2.5 million infected people and nearly 200.000 deaths. Amplification of viral RNA by RT-PCR represents the gold standard for confirmation of infection, yet it showed false-negative rates as large as 15-20% which may jeopardize the effect of the restrictive measures taken by governments. We previously showed that several hematological parameters were significantly different between COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Among them aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase had predictive values as large as 90%. Thus a combination of RT-PCR and blood tests could reduce the false-negative rate of the genetic test. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 24 patients showing multiple and inconsistent RT-PCR, test during their first hospitalization period, and compared the genetic tests results with their AST and LDH levels. RESULTS: We showed that when considering the hematological parameters, the RT-PCR false-negative rates were reduced by almost 4-fold. CONCLUSIONS: The study represents a preliminary work aiming at the development of strategies that, by combining RT-PCR tests with routine blood tests, will lower or even abolish the rate of RT-PCR false-negative results and thus will identify, with high accuracy, patients infected by COVID-19.","Ferrari, Davide; Sabetta, Eleonora; Ceriotti, Daniele; Motta, Andrea; Strollo, Marta; Banfi, Giuseppe; Locatelli, Massimo",Acta Biomed,967,1

Cohen et al., 2020). Here, we consider what we believe to be the especially confused and confusing case of the ageing of the human immune system, commonly referred to as ""immunosenescence"". But what exactly is meant by this term? It has been used loosely in the literature, resulting in a certain degree of confusion as to its definition and implications. Here, we argue that only those differences in immune parameters between younger and older adults that are associated in some definitive manner with detrimental health outcomes and/or impaired survival prospects should be classed as indicators of immunosenescence in the strictest sense of the word, and that in humans we know remarkably little about their identity. Such biomarkers of immunosenescence may nonetheless indicate beneficial effects in other contexts, consistent with the notion of antagonistic pleiotropy. Identifying what could be true immunosenescence in this respect requires examining: (1) what appears to correlate with age, though generality across human populations is not yet confirmed; (2) what clearly is part of a suite of canonical changes in the immune system that happen with age; (3) which subset of those changes accelerates rather than slows aging; and (4) all changes, potentially population-specific, that accelerate agig. This remains an immense challenge. These questions acquire an added urgency in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, given the clearly greater susceptibility of older adults to COVID-19.","Pawelec, Graham; Bronikowski, Anne; Cunnane, Stephen C; Ferrucci, Luigi; Franceschi, Claudio; Fülöp, Tamas; Gaudreau, Pierrette; Gladyshev, Vadim N; Gonos, Efstathios S; Gorbunova, Vera; Kennedy, Brian K; Larbi, Anis; Lemaître, Jean-François; Liu, Guang-Hui; Maier, Andrea B; Morais, José A; Nóbrega, Otávio T; Moskalev, Alexey; Rikkert, Marcel Olde; Seluanov, Andrei; Senior, Alistair M; Ukraintseva, Svetlana; Vanhaelen, Quentin; Witkowski, Jacek; Cohen, Alan A",Mech Ageing Dev,967,1
