90,90,90,The influenza pandemic preparedness planning tool InfluSim,14.013065,10.850079,2007-03-13,"BACKGROUND: Planning public health responses against pandemic influenza relies on predictive models by which the impact of different intervention strategies can be evaluated. Research has to date rather focused on producing predictions for certain localities or under specific conditions, than on designing a publicly available planning tool which can be applied by public health administrations. Here, we provide such a tool which is reproducible by an explicitly formulated structure and designed to operate with an optimal combination of the competing requirements of precision, realism and generality. RESULTS: InfluSim is a deterministic compartment model based on a system of over 1,000 differential equations which extend the classic SEIR model by clinical and demographic parameters relevant for pandemic preparedness planning. It allows for producing time courses and cumulative numbers of influenza cases, outpatient visits, applied antiviral treatment doses, hospitalizations, deaths and work days lost due to sickness, all of which may be associated with economic aspects. The software is programmed in Java, operates platform independent and can be executed on regular desktop computers. CONCLUSION: InfluSim is an online available software which efficiently assists public health planners in designing optimal interventions against pandemic influenza. It can reproduce the infection dynamics of pandemic influenza like complex computer simulations while offering at the same time reproducibility, higher computational performance and better operability.","Eichner, Martin; Schwehm, Markus; Duerr, Hans-Peter; Brockmann, Stefan O",BMC Infect Dis,64,3
144,144,144,"A survey of knowledge, attitudes and practices towards avian influenza in an adult population of Italy",14.193922,11.1217985,2008-03-17,"BACKGROUND: Several public health strategic interventions are required for effective prevention and control of avian influenza (AI) and it is necessary to create a communication plan to keep families adequately informed on how to avoid or reduce exposure. This investigation determined the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors relating to AI among an adult population in Italy. METHODS: From December 2005 to February 2006 a random sample of 1020 adults received a questionnaire about socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of transmission and prevention about AI, attitudes towards AI, behaviors regarding use of preventive measures and food-handling practices, and sources of information about AI. RESULTS: A response rate of 67% was achieved. Those in higher socioeconomic classes were more likely to identify the modes of transmission and the animals' vehicles for AI. Those older, who knew the modes of transmission and the animals' vehicles for AI, and who still need information, were more likely to know that washing hands soap before and after touching raw poultry meat and using gloves is recommended to avoid spreading of AI through food. The risk of being infected was significantly higher in those from lower socioeconomic classes, if they did not know the definition of AI, if they knew that AI could be transmitted by eating and touching raw eggs and poultry foods, and if they did not need information. Compliance with the hygienic practices during handling of raw poultry meat was more likely in those who perceived to be at higher risk, who knew the hygienic practices, who knew the modes of transmission and the animals' vehicles for AI, and who received information from health professionals and scientific journals. CONCLUSION: Respondents demonstrate no detailed understanding of AI, a greater perceived risk, and a lower compliance with precautions behaviors and health educational strategies are strongly needed.","Di Giuseppe, Gabriella; Abbate, Rossella; Albano, Luciana; Marinelli, Paolo; Angelillo, Italo F",BMC Infect Dis,64,3
391,391,391,Age groups and spread of influenza: implications for vaccination strategy,14.242174,10.998681,2010-04-30,"BACKGROUND: The unpredictable nature of the potentially devastating impact of 2009 pH1N1 influenza pandemic highlights the need for pandemic preparedness planning, where modeling studies could be most useful for simulations of possible future scenarios. METHODS: A compartmental model with pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic influenza infections is proposed which incorporates age groups as well as intervention measures such as age-specific vaccination, in order to study spread of influenza in a community. RESULTS: We derive the basic reproduction number and other effective reproduction numbers under various intervention measures. For illustration, we make use of the Pneumonia and Influenza (P&I) mortality data and vaccination data of the very young (age 0-2) and the very old (age >64) during 2004-2005 Taiwan winter influenza season to fit our model and to compute the relevant reproduction numbers. The reproduction number for this winter flu season is estimated to be slightly above one (~1.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Comparatively large errors in fitting the P&I mortality data of the elderly (>64) were observed shortly after winter school closings in January, which may indicate the impact of younger, more active age groups transmitting influenza to other age groups outside of the school settings; in particular, to the elderly in the households. Pre-symptomatic infections seemed to have little effect on the model fit, while asymptomatic infection by asymptomatic infectives has a more pronounced impact on the model fit for the elderly mortality, perhaps indicating a larger role in disease transmission by asymptomatic infection. Simulations indicate that the impact of vaccination on the disease incidence might not be fully revealed in the change (or the lack thereof) in the effective reproduction number with interventions, but could still be substantial. The estimated per contact transmission probability for susceptible elderly is significantly higher than that of any other age group, perhaps highlighting the vulnerability of the elderly due to close contacts with their caretakers from other age groups. The relative impact of targeting the very young and the very old for vaccination was weakened by their relative inactivity, thus giving evidence of the lack of impact of vaccinating these two groups on the overall transmissibility of the disease in the community. This further underscores the need for morbidity-based strategy to prevent elderly mortality.","Hsieh, Ying-Hen",BMC Infect Dis,64,3
510,510,510,"The GLEaMviz computational tool, a publicly available software to explore realistic epidemic spreading scenarios at the global scale",14.048149,10.953835,2011-02-02,"BACKGROUND: Computational models play an increasingly important role in the assessment and control of public health crises, as demonstrated during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Much research has been done in recent years in the development of sophisticated data-driven models for realistic computer-based simulations of infectious disease spreading. However, only a few computational tools are presently available for assessing scenarios, predicting epidemic evolutions, and managing health emergencies that can benefit a broad audience of users including policy makers and health institutions. RESULTS: We present ""GLEaMviz"", a publicly available software system that simulates the spread of emerging human-to-human infectious diseases across the world. The GLEaMviz tool comprises three components: the client application, the proxy middleware, and the simulation engine. The latter two components constitute the GLEaMviz server. The simulation engine leverages on the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEaM) framework, a stochastic computational scheme that integrates worldwide high-resolution demographic and mobility data to simulate disease spread on the global scale. The GLEaMviz design aims at maximizing flexibility in defining the disease compartmental model and configuring the simulation scenario; it allows the user to set a variety of parameters including: compartment-specific features, transition values, and environmental effects. The output is a dynamic map and a corresponding set of charts that quantitatively describe the geo-temporal evolution of the disease. The software is designed as a client-server system. The multi-platform client, which can be installed on the user's local machine, is used to set up simulations that will be executed on the server, thus avoiding specific requirements for large computational capabilities on the user side. CONCLUSIONS: The user-friendly graphical interface of the GLEaMviz tool, along with its high level of detail and the realism of its embedded modeling approach, opens up the platform to simulate realistic epidemic scenarios. These features make the GLEaMviz computational tool a convenient teaching/training tool as well as a first step toward the development of a computational tool aimed at facilitating the use and exploitation of computational models for the policy making and scenario analysis of infectious disease outbreaks.","Broeck, Wouter Van den; Gioannini, Corrado; Gonçalves, Bruno; Quaggiotto, Marco; Colizza, Vittoria; Vespignani, Alessandro",BMC Infect Dis,64,3
619,619,619,"Description of two measles outbreaks in the Lazio Region, Italy (2006-2007). Importance of pockets of low vaccine coverage in sustaining the infection",14.057087,11.218216,2010-03-11,"BACKGROUND: Despite the launch of the national plan for measles elimination, in Italy, immunization coverage remains suboptimal and outbreaks continue to occur. Two measles outbreaks, occurred in Lazio region during 2006-2007, were investigated to identify sources of infection, transmission routes, and assess operational implications for elimination of the disease. METHODS: Data were obtained from several sources, the routine infectious diseases surveillance system, field epidemiological investigations, and molecular genotyping of virus by the national reference laboratory. RESULTS: Overall 449 cases were reported, sustained by two different stereotypes overlapping for few months. Serotype D4 was likely imported from Romania by a Roma/Sinti family and subsequently spread to the rest of the population. Serotype B3 was responsible for the second outbreak which started in a secondary school. Pockets of low vaccine coverage individuals (Roma/Sinti communities, high school students) facilitated the reintroduction of serotypes not endemic in Italy and facilitated the measles infection to spread. CONCLUSIONS: Communities with low vaccine coverage represent a more serious public health threat than do sporadic susceptible individuals. The successful elimination of measles will require additional efforts to immunize low vaccine coverage population groups, including hard-to-reach individuals, adolescents, and young adults. An enhanced surveillance systems, which includes viral genotyping to document chains of transmission, is an essential tool for evaluating strategy to control and eliminate measles","Curtale, Filippo; Perrelli, Fabrizio; Mantovani, Jessica; Atti, Marta Ciofi degli; Filia, Antonietta; Nicoletti, Loredana; Magurano, Fabio; Borgia, Piero; Di Lallo, Domenico",BMC Infect Dis,64,3

We conducted a multicentric study to describe pattern of influenza A/H1N1v infection among hospitalized children in Brussels, Belgium. METHODS: From July 1, 2009, to January 31, 2010, we collected epidemiological and clinical data of all proven (positive H1N1v PCR) and probable (positive influenza A antigen or culture) pediatric cases of influenza A/H1N1v infections, hospitalized in four tertiary centers. RESULTS: During the epidemic period, an excess of 18% of pediatric outpatients and emergency department visits was registered. 215 children were hospitalized with proven/probable influenza A/H1N1v infection. Median age was 31 months. 47% had ≥ 1 comorbid conditions. Febrile respiratory illness was the most common presentation. 36% presented with initial gastrointestinal symptoms and 10% with neurological manifestations. 34% had pneumonia. Only 24% of the patients received oseltamivir but 57% received antibiotics. 10% of children were admitted to PICU, seven of whom with ARDS. Case fatality-rate was 5/215 (2%), concerning only children suffering from chronic neurological disorders. Children over 2 years of age showed a higher propensity to be admitted to PICU (16% vs 1%, p = 0.002) and a higher mortality rate (4% vs 0%, p = 0.06). Infants less than 3 months old showed a milder course of infection, with few respiratory and neurological complications. CONCLUSION: Although influenza A/H1N1v infections were generally self-limited, pediatric burden of disease was significant. Compared to other countries experiencing different health care systems, our Belgian cohort was younger and received less frequently antiviral therapy; disease course and mortality were however similar.","Blumental, Sophie; Huisman, Elisabeth; Cornet, Marie-Coralie; Ferreiro, Christine; De Schutter, Iris; Reynders, Marijke; Wybo, Ingrid; Kabamba-Mukadi, Benoît; Armano, Ruth; Hermans, Dominique; Nassogne, Marie-Cécile; Mahadeb, Bhavna; Fonteyne, Christine; Van Berlaer, Gerlant; Levy, Jack; Moulin, Didier; Vergison, Anne; Malfroot, Anne; Lepage, Philippe",BMC Infect Dis,64,3
740,740,740,Timeliness of contact tracing among flight passengers for influenza A/H1N1 2009,14.032824,10.856286,2011-12-28,"BACKGROUND: During the initial containment phase of influenza A/H1N1 2009, close contacts of cases were traced to provide antiviral prophylaxis within 48 h after exposure and to alert them on signs of disease for early diagnosis and treatment. Passengers seated on the same row, two rows in front or behind a patient infectious for influenza, during a flight of ≥ 4 h were considered close contacts. This study evaluates the timeliness of flight-contact tracing (CT) as performed following national and international CT requests addressed to the Center of Infectious Disease Control (CIb/RIVM), and implemented by the Municipal Health Services of Schiphol Airport. METHODS: Elapsed days between date of flight arrival and the date passenger lists became available (contact details identified - CI) was used as proxy for timeliness of CT. In a retrospective study, dates of flight arrival, onset of illness, laboratory diagnosis, CT request and identification of contacts details through passenger lists, following CT requests to the RIVM for flights landed at Schiphol Airport were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: 24 requests for CT were identified. Three of these were declined as over 4 days had elapsed since flight arrival. In 17 out of 21 requests, contact details were obtained within 7 days after arrival (81%). The average delay between arrival and CI was 3,9 days (range 2-7), mainly caused by delay in diagnosis of the index patient after arrival (2,6 days). In four flights (19%), contacts were not identified or only after > 7 days. CI involving Dutch airlines was faster than non-Dutch airlines (P < 0,05). Passenger locator cards did not improve timeliness of CI. In only three flights contact details were identified within 2 days after arrival. CONCLUSION: CT for influenza A/H1N1 2009 among flight passengers was not successful for timely provision of prophylaxis. CT had little additional value for alerting passengers for disease symptoms, as this information already was provided during and after the flight. Public health authorities should take into account patient delays in seeking medical advise and laboratory confirmation in relation to maximum time to provide postexposure prophylaxis when deciding to install contact tracing measures. International standardization of CT guidelines is recommended.","Swaan, Corien M; Appels, Rolf; Kretzschmar, Mirjam EE; van Steenbergen, Jim E",BMC Infect Dis,64,3

ACE2 has been detected in urine from patients with chronic kidney disease. We measured urinary ACE2 activity and protein levels in renal transplant patients (age 54 yrs, 65% male, 38% diabetes, n = 100) and healthy controls (age 45 yrs, 26% male, n = 50), and determined factors associated with elevated urinary ACE2 in the patients. Urine from transplant subjects was also assayed for ACE mRNA and protein. No subjects were taking inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. Urinary ACE2 levels were significantly higher in transplant patients compared to controls (p = 0.003 for ACE2 activity, and p≤0.001 for ACE2 protein by ELISA or western analysis). Transplant patients with diabetes mellitus had significantly increased urinary ACE2 activity and protein levels compared to non-diabetics (p<0.001), while ACE2 mRNA levels did not differ. Urinary ACE activity and protein were significantly increased in diabetic transplant subjects, while ACE mRNA levels did not differ from non-diabetic subjects. After adjusting for confounding variables, diabetes was significantly associated with urinary ACE2 activity (p = 0.003) and protein levels (p<0.001), while female gender was associated with urinary mRNA levels for both ACE2 and ACE. These data indicate that urinary ACE2 is increased in renal transplant recipients with diabetes, possibly due to increased shedding from tubular cells. Urinary ACE2 could be a marker of renal renin-angiotensin system activation in these patients.","Xiao, Fengxia; Hiremath, Swapnil; Knoll, Greg; Zimpelmann, Joseph; Srivaratharajah, Kajenny; Jadhav, Deepak; Fergusson, Dean; Kennedy, Chris R.

Influenza infection during pregnancy is associated with adverse fetal outcomes such as preterm birth and small for gestational age (SGA). Maternal influenza immunization may prevent these adverse infant outcomes during periods of influenza circulation. Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of live births within Kaiser Permanente (KP) Georgia and Mid-Atlantic States (n = 3327) during the period of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus circulation. Primary outcomes were third-trimester preterm birth (27–36 weeks), birth weight, low birth weight (LBW, <2500 g), and SGA. Results. There were 327 (9.8%) preterm, 236 (7.4%) LBW, and 267 (8.4%) SGA births. Among H1N1-vaccinated mothers (n = 1125), there were 86 (7.6%) preterm, 68 (6.4%) LBW, and 99 (9.3%) SGA births, and the mean birth weight was 3308.5 g (95% confidence interval [CI], 3276.6–3340.4). Among unvaccinated mothers (n = 1581), there were 191 (12.1%) preterm, 132 (8.8%) LBW, and 123 (8.2%) SGA births, and the mean birth weight was 3245.3 g (95% CI, 3216.5–3274.2). Infants of H1N1-vaccinated mothers had 37% lower odds of being born preterm than infants of unvaccinated mothers (adjusted odds ratio, 0.63 [95% CI, .47–.84]). The mean birth weight difference between infants of H1N1-vaccinated mothers and infants of unvaccinated mothers was 45.1 g (95% CI, 1.8–88.3). There was no significant association between maternal H1N1 influenza immunization and LBW or SGA. Conclusions. Pregnant women who received H1N1 influenza vaccine were less likely to give birth preterm, and gave birth to heavier infants.

1785,1785,1785,Selection of key recommendations for quality indicators describing good quality outbreak response,14.149079,11.187694,2015-03-31,"BACKGROUND: The performance of recommended control measures is necessary for quick and uniform infectious disease outbreak control. To assess whether these procedures are performed, a valid set of quality indicators (QIs) is required. The goal of this study was to select a set of key recommendations that can be systematically translated into QIs to measure the quality of infectious disease outbreak response from the perspective of disaster emergency responders and infectious disease control professionals. METHODS: Applying the Rand modified Delphi procedure, the following steps were taken to systematically select a set of key recommendations: extraction of recommendations from relevant literature; appraisal of the recommendations in terms of relevance through questionnaires to experts; expert meeting to discuss recommendations; prioritization of recommendations through a second questionnaire; and final expert meeting to approve the selected set. Infectious disease physicians and nurses, policymakers and communication experts participated in the expert group (n = 48). RESULTS: In total, 54 national and international publications were systematically searched for recommendations, yielding over 200 recommendations. The Rand modified Delphi procedure resulted in a set of 65 key recommendations. The key recommendations were categorized into 10 domains describing the whole response pathway from outbreak recognition to aftercare. CONCLUSION: This study provides a set of key recommendations that represents ‘good quality of response to an infectious disease outbreak’. These key recommendations can be systematically translated into QIs. Organizations and professionals involved in outbreak control can use these QIs to monitor the quality of response to infectious disease outbreaks and to assess in which domains improvement is needed.

2113,2113,2113,Global Mortality Impact of the 1957–1959 Influenza Pandemic,14.100224,11.057108,2016-03-01,"Background. Quantitative estimates of the global burden of the 1957 influenza pandemic are lacking. Here we fill this gap by modeling historical mortality statistics. Methods. We used annual rates of age- and cause-specific deaths to estimate pandemic-related mortality in excess of background levels in 39 countries in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Americas. We modeled the relationship between excess mortality and development indicators to extrapolate the global burden of the pandemic. Results. The pandemic-associated excess respiratory mortality rate was 1.9/10 000 population (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2–2.6 cases/10 000 population) on average during 1957–1959. Excess mortality rates varied 70-fold across countries; Europe and Latin America experienced the lowest and highest rates, respectively. Excess mortality was delayed by 1–2 years in 18 countries (46%). Increases in the mortality rate relative to baseline were greatest in school-aged children and young adults, with no evidence that elderly population was spared from excess mortality. Development indicators were moderate predictors of excess mortality, explaining 35%–77% of the variance. Overall, we attribute 1.1 million excess deaths (95% CI, .7 million–1.5 million excess deaths) globally to the 1957–1959 pandemic. Conclusions. The global mortality rate of the 1957–1959 influenza pandemic was moderate relative to that of the 1918 pandemic but was approximately 10-fold greater than that of the 2009 pandemic. The impact of the pandemic on mortality was delayed in several countries, pointing to a window of opportunity for vaccination in a future pandemic.","Viboud, Cécile; Simonsen, Lone; Fuentes, Rodrigo; Flores, Jose; Miller, Mark A.; Chowell, Gerardo",J Infect Dis,64,3

H2N2 viruses have caused a prior pandemic, and are circulating in avian reservoirs. The age-related frequency of current population immunity to H2 viruses was evaluated. METHODS: Hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays against historical human and recent avian influenza A(H2N2) viruses were performed across age groups in Rochester, New York, and Hong Kong, China. The impact of existing cross-reactive HAI immunity on the effective reproduction number was modeled. RESULTS: One hundred fifty individual sera from Rochester and 295 from Hong Kong were included. Eighty-five percent of patients born in Rochester and Hong Kong before 1968 had HAI titers ≥1:40 against A/Singapore/1/57, and >50% had titers ≥1:40 against A/Berkeley/1/68. The frequency of titers ≥1:40 to avian H2N2 A/mallard/England/727/06 and A/mallard/Netherlands/14/07 in subjects born before 1957 was 62% and 24%, respectively. There were no H2 HAI titers >1:40 in individuals born after 1968. These levels of seroprevalence reduce the initial reproduction number of A/Singapore/1/1957 or A/Berkeley/1/68 by 15%–20%. A basic reproduction number (R(0)) of the emerging transmissible virus <1.2 predicts a preventable pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Population immunity to H2 viruses is insufficient to block epidemic spread of H2 virus. An H2N2 pandemic would have lower impact in those born before 1968.","Babu, Tara M; Perera, Ranawaka A P M; Wu, Joseph T; Fitzgerald, Theresa; Nolan, Carolyn; Cowling, Benjamin J; Krauss, Scott; Treanor, John J; Peiris, Malik",J Infect Dis,64,3
3451,3451,3451,Fomite-mediated transmission as a sufficient pathway: a comparative analysis across three viral pathogens,14.035147,11.130034,2018-10-29,"BACKGROUND: Fomite mediated transmission can be an important pathway causing significant disease transmission in number of settings such as schools, daycare centers, and long-term care facilities. The importance of these pathways relative to other transmission pathways such as direct person-person or airborne will depend on the characteristics of the particular pathogen and the venue in which transmission occurs. Here we analyze fomite mediated transmission through a comparative analysis across multiple pathogens and venues. METHODS: We developed and analyzed a compartmental model that explicitly accounts for fomite transmission by including pathogen transfer between hands and surfaces. We consider two sub-types of fomite-mediated transmission: direct fomite (e.g., shedding onto fomites) and hand-fomite (e.g., shedding onto hands and then contacting fomites). We use this model to examine three pathogens with distinct environmental characteristics (influenza, rhinovirus, and norovirus) in four venue types. To parameterize the model for each pathogen we conducted a thorough literature search. RESULTS: Based on parameter estimates from the literature the reproductive number ([Formula: see text] ) for the fomite route for rhinovirus and norovirus is greater than 1 in nearly all venues considered, suggesting that this route can sustain transmission. For influenza, on the other hand, [Formula: see text] for the fomite route is smaller suggesting many conditions in which the pathway may not sustain transmission. Additionally, the direct fomite route is more relevant than the hand-fomite route for influenza and rhinovirus, compared to norovirus. The relative importance of the hand-fomite vs. direct fomite route for norovirus is strongly dependent on the fraction of pathogens initially shed to hands. Sensitivity analysis stresses the need for accurate measurements of environmental inactivation rates, transfer efficiencies, and pathogen shedding. CONCLUSIONS: Fomite-mediated transmission is an important pathway for the three pathogens examined. The effectiveness of environmental interventions differs significantly both by pathogen and venue. While fomite-based interventions may be able to lower [Formula: see text] for fomites below 1 and interrupt transmission, rhinovirus and norovirus are so infectious ([Formula: see text] ) that single environmental interventions are unlikely to interrupt fomite transmission for these pathogens.

This provided a unique opportunity to investigate the antibody response to H1N1pdm09 over time. METHODS: Healthcare workers (HCWs) were immunized with the AS03-adjuvanted H1N1pdm09 vaccine in 2009 (N = 250), and subsequently vaccinated with seasonal vaccines containing H1N1pdm09 for 4 seasons (repeated group), <4 seasons (occasional group), or no seasons (single group). Blood samples were collected pre and at 21 days and 3, 6, and 12 months after each vaccination, or annually (pre-season) from 2010 in the single group. The H1N1pdm09-specific antibodies were measured by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. RESULTS: Pandemic vaccination robustly induced HI antibodies that persisted above the 50% protective threshold (HI titers ≥ 40) over 12 months post-vaccination. Previous seasonal vaccination and the duration of adverse events after the pandemic vaccination influenced the decision to vaccinate in subsequent seasons. During 2010/2011–2013/2014, antibodies were boosted after each seasonal vaccination, although no significant difference was observed between the repeated and occasional groups. In the single group without seasonal vaccination, 32% of HCWs seroconverted (≥4-fold increase in HI titers) during the 4 subsequent years, most of whom had HI titers <40 prior to seroconversion. When excluding these seroconverted HCWs, HI titers gradually declined from 12 to 60 months post–pandemic vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic vaccination elicited durable antibodies, supporting the incorporation of adjuvant. Our findings support the current recommendation of annual influenza vaccination in HCWs.

Overall, 234 (41.4%) of enrolled HCWs were reactive to at least 1 EBOV protein: 159 (28.1%) were seroreactive for anti-glycoprotein immunoglobulin G (IgG), 89 (15.8%) were seroreactive for anti-nucleoprotein IgG, and 54 (9.5%) were VP40 positive. Additionally, sera from 16 (2.8%) HCWs demonstrated neutralization capacity. These data demonstrate that a significant proportion of HCWs have the ability to neutralize virus, despite never having developed Ebola virus disease symptoms, highlighting an important and poorly documented aspect of EBOV infection and progression.","Hoff, Nicole A; Mukadi, Patrick; Doshi, Reena H; Bramble, Matthew S; Lu, Kai; Gadoth, Adva; Sinai, Cyrus; Spencer, D’Andre; Nicholson, Bradley P; Williams, Russell; Mossoko, Matthias; Ilunga-Kebela, Benoit; Wasiswa, Joseph; Okitolonda-Wemakoy, Emile; Alfonso, Vivian H; Steffen, Imke; Muyembe-Tamfum, Jean-Jacques; Simmons, Graham; Rimoin, Anne W",J Infect Dis,64,3

Little is understood regarding how specific thymine residues are targeted for J-modification or the mechanism of J regulated transcription termination. To identify proteins involved in J-synthesis, we expressed a tagged version of the J-glucosyltransferase (JGT) in Leishmania tarentolae, and identified four co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry: protein phosphatase (PP1), a homolog of Wdr82, a potential PP1 regulatory protein (PNUTS) and a protein containing a J-DNA binding domain (named JBP3). Gel shift studies indicate JBP3 is a J-DNA binding protein. Reciprocal tagging, co-IP and sucrose gradient analyses indicate PP1, JGT, JBP3, Wdr82 and PNUTS form a multimeric complex in kinetoplastids, similar to the mammalian PTW/PP1 complex involved in transcription termination via PP1 mediated dephosphorylation of Pol II. Using RNAi and analysis of Pol II termination by RNA-seq and RT-PCR, we demonstrate that ablation of PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 lead to defects in Pol II termination at the 3’-end of polycistronic gene arrays in Trypanosoma brucei. Mutants also contain increased antisense RNA levels upstream of transcription start sites, suggesting an additional role of the complex in regulating termination of bi-directional transcription. In addition, PNUTS loss causes derepression of silent Variant Surface Glycoprotein genes involved in host immune evasion. Our results suggest a novel mechanistic link between base J and Pol II polycistronic transcription termination in kinetoplastids.","Kieft, Rudo; Zhang, Yang; Marand, Alexandre P.; Moran, Jose Dagoberto; Bridger, Robert; Wells, Lance; Schmitz, Robert J.; Sabatini, Robert",PLoS Genet,64,12

Genetically modified piglets were then generated via somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and bred to yield litters comprising J(H) wild-type littermate (+/+), J(H) heterozygous knockout (±) and J(H) homozygous knockout (−/−) piglets in the expected Mendelian ratio of 1:2:1. There are only two other targeted loci previously published in swine, and this is the first successful poly(A)-trap strategy ever published in a livestock species. In either blood or secondary lymphoid tissues, flow cytometry, RT-PCR and ELISA detected no circulating IgM(+) B cells, and no transcription or secretion of immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes, respectively in J(H) −/− pigs. Histochemical and immunohistochemical (IHC) studies failed to detect lymph node (LN) follicles or CD79α(+) B cells, respectively in J(H) −/− pigs. T cell receptor (TCR)(β) transcription and T cells were detected in J(H) −/− pigs. When reared conventionally, J(H) −/− pigs succumbed to bacterial infections after weaning. These antibody (Ab)- and B cell-deficient pigs have significant value as models for both veterinary and human research to discriminate cellular and humoral protective immunity to infectious agents. Thus, these pigs may aid in vaccine development for infectious agents such as the pandemic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and H1N1 swine flu. These pigs are also a first significant step towards generating a pig that expresses fully human, antigen-specific polyclonal Ab to target numerous incurable infectious diseases with high unmet clinical need.","Mendicino, M.; Ramsoondar, J.; Phelps, C.; Vaught, T.; Ball, S.; LeRoith, T.; Monahan, J.; Chen, S.; Dandro, A.; Boone, J.; Jobst, P.; Vance, A.; Wertz, N.; Bergman, Z.; Sun, X-Z.; Polejaeva, I.; Butler, J.; Dai, Y.; Ayares, D.; Wells, K.",Transgenic Res,64,3

The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of LR blood on morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that the use of LR blood does not improve outcome in trauma patients. METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis of trauma patients transfused at a level 1 Trauma Center from 2001 to 2004. Between 2002 and 2003, LR blood was transfused. Prior to that time and subsequent to it, non-leukoreduced (NLR) blood was transfused. This created two historical comparison groups. Data collected included patient demographics, units of blood transfused, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital days, ventilator days, injury severity score (ISS), mortality, presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and infectious complications. A multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) score was calculated. RESULTS: The distribution of patients was as follows: 284 patients received only NLR blood, 153 received only LR blood, and 58 received at least one unit of each. The mean ISS was similar (NLR: 26, LR: 24; P > 0.1). No differences were seen between groups in units transfused (6.2 vs. 5.5), number of ICU days (8.2 vs. 9.0), number of hospital days (16.9 vs. 18.6), number of ventilator days (6.1 vs. 5.7), incidence of ARDS (8.3% vs. 8.5%), MODS score (5.5 vs. 5.9), mortality rate (15.1% vs. 15.7%), or infection rate (36% vs. 30%) (P > 0.1).

Key to understanding their function is recognition of their pleiotropism and often overlapping and functional redundancies. Classified here into 9 main families, most of the 20 approved cytokine preparations (18 different cytokines; 3 pegylated), all in recombinant human (rh) form, are grouped in the hematopoietic growth factor, interferon, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) families. In the hematopoietin family, approved cytokines are aldesleukin (rhIL-2), oprelvekin (rhIL-11), filgrastim and tbo-filgrastim (rhG-CSF), sargramostim (rhGM-CSF), metreleptin (rh-leptin) and the rh-erythropoietins, epoetin and darbepoietin alfa. Anakinra, a recombinant receptor antagonist for IL-1, is in the IL-1 family; recombinant interferons alfa-1, alfa-2, beta-1 and gamma-1 make up the interferon family; palifermin (rhKGF) and becaplermin (rhPDGF) are in the PDGF family; and rhBMP-2 and rhBMP-7 represent the TGFβ family. The main physicochemical features, FDA-approved indications, modes of action and side effects of these approved cytokines are presented. Underlying each adverse events profile is their pleiotropism, potency and capacity to release other cytokines producing cytokine ‘cocktails’. Side effects, some serious, occur despite cytokines being endogenous proteins, and this therefore demands caution in attempts to introduce individual members into the clinic. This caution is reflected in the relatively small number of cytokines currently approved by regulatory agencies and by the fact that 14 of the FDA-approved preparations carry warnings, with 10 being black box warnings.","Baldo, Brian A.",Drug Saf,64,3

In a previous study we found that a monoclonal anti-SP-A antibody (R 5) increased the sensitivity of surfactant to inhibition by fibrinogen in vivo and in vitro. SP-A has been shown to stimulate microbial phagocytosis and killing by alveolar macrophages. We hypothesized that using R 5 to inactivate SP-A in an animal model mimicking congenital group B streptococcal (GBS) pneumonia might result in increased bacterial proliferation and a deterioration in lung function. Newborn near term rabbits were delivered by Cesarean section, anesthetized, tracheotomized, and ventilated for 5 h in a plethysmograph system allowing measurement of dynamic lung-thorax compliance. Postnatally the animals received one intratracheal injection (5 ml/kg) of R 5, nonspecific IgG, or normal saline. At 30 min all animals received a standard dose of an encapsulated GBS strain by intratracheal injection. The number of bacteria (mean log(10) CFU/g lung ± S.D.; CFU = colony forming unit) was evaluated in lung homogenates. Histologic lung sections were judged by light microscopy. Bacterial proliferation was similar in rabbits treated with the monoclonal antibody (9.33 ± 0.39; n= 14) and in control animals receiving saline (9.16 ± 0.35; n= 14) or nonspecific IgG (9.26 ± 0.31; n= 11). No significant differences were noted on the histologic analysis or in measurements of lung function. We conclude that intratracheal instillation of a monoclonal anti-SP-A antibody did not increase bacterial proliferation in GBS-infected newborn rabbits. These findings suggest that SP-A does not play an important role in protection against encapsulated GBS strains in the neonatal period.","Herting, E.; Strayer, D.

Clinical assessment tools have poor sensitivity for predicting clinical outcomes. Molecular measurements of bacterial load correlate closely with clinical outcome but require specialist facilities and expertise. This study describes how routine blood culture testing can estimate bacterial load and predict clinical outcome for invasive pneumococcal pneumonia. Between December 2009 to March 2014, clinical and laboratory data were collected for 50 patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteraemia secondary to community-acquired pneumonia. Fluorescence rates (FR) were calculated from growth curves generated by BACTEC blood culture analysers by dividing change in fluorescence units (FU), measured at the first point of detectable fluorescence and at the point of automated BACTEC positivity, by time in hours. The mean age of the patients was 70.6 years (49.6–86.3). Forty patients survived invasive pneumococcal disease and ten patients died. These two groups did not significantly differ by demographic or clinical characteristics. The mean FR for the non-survival group (3.62 × 10(−3) FU/h) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than that of the survival group (1.73 × 10(−3) FU/h). FR did not vary by serotype. We determined that an FR of 2.59 × 10(−3) FU/h might represent a useful threshold for predicting high mortality risk with a sensitivity of 91 % and a specificity of 97 %. Our FR calculation uses cheap and accessible routine blood culture techniques to predict mortality in a small retrospective cohort study. In patients admitted to hospital with pneumococcal bacteraemia and, potentially, other organisms, this single tool could guide early escalation of clinical care.","Fink, D.; Barakat, F.; Ellis, J.; Lakra, C.; Bodhani, R.; Creer, D.; Elsaghier, A.",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,64,3

Intranasal infection of immunocompetent mice with MCMV resulted in transient and self-limited pulmonary lesions. When mice were given 200 mg/kg of CP one day before virus infection, transient splenic atrophy and subsequent splenic hypertrophy were induced, and the lesions in the lung were markedly augmented in their number and size although there was no significant enhancement of the virus growth. The augmentation coincided with the period of splenic hypertrophy. A marked increase in the number of pulmonary lesions was also induced in mice given 100 mg/kg of CP every 4 days following the initial dose of 200 mg/kg. In these mice, however, continuous splenic atrophy and augmented replication of MCMV in the lung were observed. When the activity of xanthine oxidase (XO) in lung tissue homogenates was measured, the activity was found to significantly increase after intranasal infection with MCMV irrespective of CP administration and there was a good correlation between the elevation of XO activity and the degree of pathological changes in the lung. In addition, we found that the administration of allopurinol, a specific inhibitor of XO and superoxide dismutase, a superoxide radical scavenger, reduced the number of the pulmonary lesions. These results suggest that superoxide radicals are involved in the pathogenesis of MCMV-associated pneumonitis in ICR mice.","Ikeda, T.; Shimokata, K.; Daikoku, T.; Fukatsu, T.; Tsutsui, Y.; Nishiyama, Y.",Arch Virol,64,3

METHODS: In a prospective, cross-sectional, multicentre study, data on 540 patients with confirmed 2009 H1N1 infection from seven Austrian hospitals were collected using a standardised online case-history form. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 19.3 years (range 26 days–90.8 years); point-of-care testing yielded false-negative results in 60.2% of the 176 cases tested. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, fatigue and headache. Overall, 343 patients (63.5%) were hospitalised, 49 (9.1%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and 14 (4.1%) died. Case fatality rates were highest (9.1%) in those aged 65 years or older. Factors significantly associated with a higher risk for ICU admission included age, neurological disease, adipositas, and both interstitial pathology and lobular pathology on chest X-ray. No association with pregnancy, malignancy or immunosuppressive therapy was detected. Antiviral treatment significantly reduced the duration of fever by 0.66 days and lowered the risk of ICU admission, but had no significant benefit on survival.

It has evolved a multi-faceted, physical and immune defense system to ensure that in the majority of instances, potentially injurious invaders are repelled. Inflammation, predominantly mediated by effector cells of the granulocyte lineage including neutrophils and eosinophils, is a form of immune defense. Where inflammation proves unable to remove an inciting stimulus, chronic inflammatory disease may supervene because of the potential for tissue damage conferred by the presence of large numbers of frustrated, activated granulocytes. Successful recovery from inflammatory disease and resolution of inflammation rely on the clearance of these cells. Ideally, they should undergo apoptosis prior to phagocytosis by macrophage, dendritic, or epithelial cells. The outcome of inflammation can have serious sequelae for the integrity of the respiratory mucosa leading to disease. Therapeutic strategies to drive resolution of inflammation may be directed at the induction of granulocyte apoptosis and the enhancement of granulocyte clearance.

Here, we present an example of viral targeting for immune evasion through spatial isolation of TBK1/IKKε from mitochondrial antiviral platform, which was employed by severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), a deadly bunyavirus emerging recently. We showed that SFTSV nonstructural protein NSs functions as the interferon (IFN) antagonist, mainly via suppressing TBK1/IKKε–IRF3 signaling. NSs mediates the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IBs), and the blockage of IB formation impairs IFN-inhibiting activity of NSs. We next demonstrate that IBs are utilized to compartmentalize TBK1/IKKε. The compartmentalization results in spatial isolation of the kinases from mitochondria, and deprived TBK1/IKKε may participate in antiviral complex assembly, leading to the blockage of IFN induction. This study proposes a new role of viral IBs as virus-built ‘jail’ for imprisoning cellular factors and presents a novel and likely common mechanism of viral immune evasion through spatial isolation of critical signaling molecules from the mitochondrial antiviral platform.","Ning, Yun-Jia; Wang, Manli; Deng, Maping; Shen, Shu; Liu, Wei; Cao, Wu-Chun; Deng, Fei; Wang, Yan-Yi; Hu, Zhihong; Wang, Hualin",J Mol Cell Biol,64,3

Avian H5N1 influenza A virus is an emerging pathogen with the potential to cause substantial human morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the ability of currently licensed seasonal influenza vaccine to confer cross-protection against highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in mice. Methods. BALB/c mice were inoculated 3 times, either intranasally or subcutaneously, with the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine licensed in Japan for the 2005–2006 season. The vaccine included A/NewCaledonia/20/99 (H1N1), A/NewYork/55/2004 (H3N2), and B/Shanghai/361/2002 viral strains and was administered together with poly(I):poly(C(12)U) (Ampligen) as an adjuvant. At 14 days after the final inoculation, the inoculated mice were challenged with either the A/HongKong/483/97, the A/Vietnam/1194/04, or the A/Indonesia/6/05 strain of H5N1 influenza virus. Results. Compared with noninoculated mice, those inoculated intranasally manifested cross-reactivity of mucosal IgA and serum IgG with H5N1 virus, as well as both a reduced H5N1 virus titer in nasal-wash samples and increased survival, after challenge with H5N1 virus. Subcutaneous inoculation did not induce a cross-reactive IgA response and did not afford protection against H5N1 viral infection. Conclusions. Intranasal inoculation with annual influenza vaccine plus the Toll-like receptor—3 agonist, poly(I): poly(C(12)U), may overcome the problem of a limited supply of H5N1 virus vaccine by providing cross-protective mucosal immunity against H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential.","Ichinohe, Takeshi; Tamura, Shin-ichi; Kawaguchi, Akira; Ninomiya, Ai; Imai, Masaki; Itamura, Shigeyuki; Odagiri, Takato; Tashiro, Masato; Takahashi, Hidehiro; Sawa, Hirofumi; Mitchell, William M.; Strayer, David R.; Carter, William A.; Chiba, Joe; Kurata, Takeshi; Sata, Tetsutaro; Hasegawa, Hideki",J Infect Dis,64,3

Concerns included housing conditions, dietary regimens, management practices, and behavioral aspects imposed on special-fed calves. Four categories of parameters including environment and housing, nutrition, health and stress, and behavior provided a broad base of evaluating veal systems. Observations and samples were collected on 550 Holstein bull calves located in 10 commercial veal facilities. Each facility was visited to collect data during wk 0 (week of arrival of the calves), 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Nine facilities used individual stalls 48 to 55 cm in width with tethers attached to the front of the stalls. One facility housed 30 calves in group pens after obtaining calves at 8 wk of age. Ammonia, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide gas did not exceed the permissible limit for humans in any facility. All facilities exceeded the 2-foot-candle recommendation for lighting. The average daily gain of calves was .85 kg during wk 0 to 8 and 1.18 kg during wk 8 to 16. Dietary iron levels decreased from 209 ppm at wk 0 to 32 ppm at wk 16. At 16 wk, 25% of calves were marginally anemic and 10% clinically anemic. Overall mortality was 4.2%. Stress indices such as plasma Cortisol concentrations or neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios declined as calves approached market weight. In either pens or stalls, calves spent approximately 25 and 75% of time in standing and lying positions, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Stull, C. L.; McDonough, S.

However, the non-structural protein 3C protease (3Cpro) is essential for viral replication and is relatively highly conserved among serotypes, making it a potential target for diagnostic testing. The thin film biosensor is an assay platform that can be formatted into a sensitive immunoassay for viral proteins in clinical specimens. The technology utilizes an optically coated silicon surface to convert specific molecular binding events into visual color changes by altering the reflective properties of light through molecular thin films. Objective: To develop a rapid test for detection of HRV by developing broadly serotype reactive antibodies to 3Cpro and utilizing them in the thin film biosensor format. Study design: Polyclonal antibodies to 3Cpro were purified and incorporated into the thin film assay. The in vitro sensitivity, specificity and multiserotype cross-reactivity of the 3Cpro assay were tested. Nasal washes from naturally infected individuals were also tested to verify that 3Cpro was detectable in clinical specimens. Results: The 3Cpro assay is a 28-min, non-instrumented room temperature test with a visual limit of detection of 12 pM (picomolar) 3Cpro. In terms of viral titer, as few as 1000 TCID(50) equivalents of HRV2 were detectable. The assay detected 45/52 (87%) of the HRV serotypes tested but showed no cross-reactivity to common respiratory viruses or bacteria. The thin film assay detected 3Cpro in HRV-infected cell culture supernatants coincident with first appearance of cytopathic effect. Data are also presented demonstrating 3Cpro detection from clinical samples collected from HRV-infected individuals. The assay detected 3Cpro in expelled nasal secretions from a symptomatic individual on the first day of illness. In addition, 9/11 (82%) concentrated nasal wash specimens from HRV infected children were positive in the 3Cpro test. Conclusion: We have described a novel, sensitive thin film biosensor for rapid detection of HRV 3Cpro. This test may be suitable for the point of care setting, where rapid HRV diagnostic test results could contribute to clinical decisions regarding appropriate antibiotic or antiviral therapy.","Ostroff, Rachel; Ettinger, Anna; La, Helen; Rihanek, Marynette; Zalman, Leora; Meador, James; Patick, Amy K; Worland, Steve; Polisky, Barry",J Clin Virol,64,3

They provide more rapid and sensitive testing that impacts directly on clinical management of infected patients. Molecular diagnostic tests arose from the need to detect micro-organisms that are slow or difficult to grow, or that are present in only small numbers. Nucleic acid amplification techniques (e.g. polymerase chain reaction, PCR) can detect DNA or RNA specific to certain micro-organisms and do not rely on either the recovery of the pathogen or an immune response in the infected patient. Alternative nucleic acid amplification methods have emerged recently because of increasing commercial interest in infectious disease diagnostics and the comprehensive patient protection of PCR technology. Such techniques are gaining widespread acceptance, and have displaced more conventional gold-standard testing in some areas of infectious disease (e.g. viral load testing in HIV-1 infected patients, diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infection). Genetic characterization techniques are increasingly used to determine the relatedness of micro-organisms in the clinical setting. These methods are useful in establishing routes or sources of infection in outbreaks of disease, and are powerful epidemiological tools in large-scale clinical investigations. Recently, there has been a move towards pathogen characterization techniques based on direct nucleotide sequencing (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, multi-locus sequence typing). These techniques offer unambiguous, portable data that can be exchanged via the Internet, strengthening collaborative efforts in the field of infectious disease research.","Fawley, Warren N; Wilcox, Mark H",Medicine (Abingdon),64,3

These cisternae, in conjunction with other associated smooth-surfaced membranes, are responsible for executing net unidirectional intracellular transport (ICT) from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) toward more distally located structures. This chapter focuses on the broad range of accessory activities that occur during transport, the family of “posttranslational modifications.” These events are, in all likelihood, not essential for the “primary” function of the GC yet they are crucial in allowing the cell to tailor its biosynthetic products for its own needs and the needs of the organism as a whole. In addition to modifying products of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the GC may be involved in processing events because of its participation in other routes of vesicular traffic—for example, centripetal traffic from the cell surface. Various nonequivalent criteria have been used to ascribe processing events to the GC-autoradiography, preparative or analytic subcellular fractionation, interruption by ICT inhibitors, and delay in the impact of cycloheximide.","Tartakoff, Alan M.",Int Rev Cytol,64,1

This is not a well-defined clinical entity, and it is evident that atypical pathogens can sometimes cause ‘typical’ pneumonias and vice versa. This emphasizes the need for microbiological diagnosis, since it affects the selection of proper treatment, in which β-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides are not effective. Moreover, mixed infections caused by atypical and typical pathogens together are common. At this moment rapid and sensitive diagnostic methods are lacking. Besides numerous viruses, the main bacterial pathogens causing atypical pneumonias are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, two chlamydial species, Chlamydia pneumoniae and C. psittaci, one rickettsia, Coxiella burnetti, and several Legionella species. The majority of these pathogens cause upper respiratory tract infections more often than overt pneumonias. An atypical agent, Chlamydia pneumoniae, has also been associated with chronic inflammatory conditions in the cardiovascular system. The most recently discovered pathogen in atypical pneumonias is a hantavirus causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.","Saikku, Pekka",Clin Microbiol Infect,64,1

To find out whether ampicillin treatment conferred any benefit over supportive care alone, a randomised, controlled trial was carried out among 889 children (under 5 years) with mild ARI in Indonesia. 447 were randomly allocated ampicillin (25-30 mg/kg body weight three times daily for 5 days) plus supportive care (continued breastfeeding, clearing of the nose, and paracetamol to control fever); 442 were allocated supportive care only. The treatment groups were almost identical after randomisation in terms of age, sex, level of parental education, history of measles immunisation, and fever. After 1 week the percentages cured were nearly identical (204 [46%] ampicillin; 209 [47%] control), as were the percentages of cases progressing to moderate ARI (56 [13%] vs 53 [12%]). The effect of treatment was not modified by age, sex, measles immunisation status, or the educational level of the parents. At the 2-week follow-up, the percentages cured were 62% (277) in the ampicillin group and 58% (256) in the control group; 14% of both groups had progressed to moderate ARI; and 24% (107) and 28% (123), respectively, still had mild ARI. None of the differences in outcome between the ampicillin and control groups was statistically significant. Thus, ampicillin plus supportive care offers no benefit over supportive care alone for treatment of mild ARI in young Indonesian children.","Sutrisna, B.; Frerichs, R.R.; Reingold, A.L.",Lancet,64,3

However, there are no broadly applicable tools similar to the frailty score as described in the elderly, to define functional phenotype in terms of physical capability and psychosocial wellbeing in CCD. The purpose of this study is to investigate the domains of the frailty in CCD. We prospectively recruited CCD (8–17.5 years old, 70% single ventricle, 27% heart failure, 12% pulmonary hypertension; NYHA classes I, II and III) and age and gender matched healthy controls (total n = 56; CCD n = 34, controls n = 22; age 12.6 ± 2.6 years; 39.3% female). We measured the five domains of frailty: slowness, weakness, exhaustion, body composition and physical activity using developmentally appropriate methods. Age and gender-based population norms were used to obtain Z scores and percentiles for each measurement. Two-tailed t-tests were used to compare the two groups. The CCD group performed significantly worse in all five domains of frailty compared to healthy controls. Slowness: 6-min walk test with Z score −3.9 ± 1.3 vs −1.4 ± 1.3, p < 0.001; weakness: handgrip strength percentile 18.9 ± 20.9 vs 57.9 ± 26.0, p < 0.001; exhaustion: multidimensional fatigue scale percentile 63.7 ± 13.5 vs 83.3 ± 14.4, p < 0.001; body composition: height percentile 43.4 ± 29.5 vs 71.4 ± 25.2, p < 0.001, weight percentile 46.0 ± 36.0 vs 70.9 ± 24.3, p = 0.006, BMI percentile 48.4 ± 35.5 vs 66.9 ± 24.2, p = 0.04, triceps skinfold thickness 41.0 ± 24.0 vs 54.4 ± 22.1, p = 0.04; physical activity: pediatric activity questionnaire score 2 ± 0.6 vs 2.7 ± 0.6, p < 0.001.

Among the 24 evaluated quality metrics, there were 3 of them which needed a correction when evaluating neonatal transport performance, because they were significantly correlated with gestational age. They were (a) stabilisation time, (b) prevalence of newborn arterial hypotension (defined by gestational age) and (c) unnoticed hypothermia at referral hospital. Conclusion: Quality evaluation through the definition of specific metrics in newborn transport is feasible.

The underlying mechanism of anti-obesity effect of A. muricata was investigated. The fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO) is a validated potential target for anti-obesity drugs. METHODS: The interaction of compounds previously characterized from A. muricata was investigated against FTO using Autodock Vina. Also, modulation of FTO and STAT-3 mRNA expression by A. muricata was investigated in high fat diet induced obese rats (HFDR) using RT-PCR. RESULTS: A significant up-regulation of FTO gene was observed in HFDR when compared to control rats, while administration of A. muricata (200 mg/kg) significantly (p < 0.05) down-regulated FTO gene expression when compared to HFDR group. The effect of obesity on STAT-3 gene expression was also reversed by A. muricata (200 mg/kg). In silico study revealed annonaine and annonioside (−9.2 kcal/mol) exhibited the highest binding affinity with FTO, followed by anonaine and isolaureline (−8.6 kcal/mol). Arg-96 is a critical amino acid enhancing anonaine, isolaureline-FTO binding. CONCLUSION: This study suggests the possible anti-obesity mechanism of A. muricata is via down-regulation of FTO with concomitant up-regulation of STAT-3 genes. This study confirmed the use of this plant in the management of obesity and the probable compounds responsible for its antiobesity effect are annonaine and annonioside.","Elekofehinti, Olusola Olalekan; Lawal, Akeem Olalekan; Ejelonu, Oluwamodupe Cecilia; Molehin, Olorunfemi Raphael; Famusiwa, Courage Dele",J Diabetes Metab Disord,64,3

We also aimed to suggest prediction models for ILI activity using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, including exogenous variables (SARIMAX) models. We collected ILI, FluNet surveillance data, Google Trends (GT), weather, and air-pollution data from 2010 to 2019, applying cross-correlation analysis to identify the time lag between the two respective time-series. The relationship between ILI in South Korea and the input variables were evaluated with Linear regression models. To validate selected input variables, the autoregressive moving average, including exogenous variables (ARMAX) models were used to forecast seasonal ILI after 2 and 30 weeks with a three-year window for the training set used in the fixed rolling window analysis. Moreover, a final SARIMAX model was constructed. Influenza A virus activity peaks in South Korea were roughly divided between the 51(st) and the 7(th) week, while those of influenza B were divided between the 3(rd) and 14(th) week. GT showed the highest correlation coefficient with forecasts from a week ahead, and seasonal influenza outbreak patterns in Argentina showed a high correlation with those 30 weeks ahead in South Korea. The prediction models after 2 and 30 weeks using ARMAX models had R(2) values of 0.789 and 0.621, respectively, indicating that reference models using only the previous seasonal ILI could be improved. The currently eligible input variables selected by the cross-correlation analysis helped propose short-term and long-term predictions for ILI in Korea. Our findings indicate that influenza surveillance in Argentina can help predict seasonal ILI patterns after 30 weeks in South Korea, and these can help the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determine vaccine strategies for the next ILI season.","Choi, Soo Beom; Ahn, Insung",PLoS One,64,16

Therefore, according to treatment guidelines, two thirds of all individuals with depression are insufficiently treated. In the past, the subjective perspective of people who (do not) make use of mental health services has been neglected. Factors related to the use of health services are described in Andersen’s Behavioral Model of Health Services Use (ABM). The aim of this study is to supplement operationalizations of subjectively perceived and evaluated individual characteristics in the ABM and to evaluate whether the supplemented model can better explain mental health services use in individuals with depression than established operationalizations. METHODS: A representative telephone study with two measurement points will be conducted. In an explanatory mixed-methods design, qualitative interviews will be added to further interpret the quantitative data. A nationwide sample scoring 5 or more on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) will be recruited and interviewed via telephone at T0 and 12 months later (T1). Data on established and subjective characteristics as well as mental health service use will be collected. At T1, conducting a diagnostic interview (Composite International Diagnostic Interview, DIA-X-12/M-CIDI) enables the recording of 12-month diagnoses according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Ideally, n = 768 datasets will be available and analyzed descriptively by means of regression analysis. Up to n = 32 persons who use or do not use depression-specific health services incongruent with their objective or subjective needs will be interviewed (face-to-face) to better explain their behavior. In addition, theories of non-need-based mental health service use are developed within the framework of the grounded theory-based analysis of the qualitative interviews. DISCUSSION: The study intends to contribute to the theoretical foundation of health services research and to specify the characteristics described in the ABM. Thus, after completion of the study, a further sophisticated and empirically tested model will be available to explain mental health services. The identified modifiable influencing factors are relevant for the development of strategies to increase mental health service use in line with the objective and subjective needs of individuals with depression.

Evidence-based psychological treatments for common childhood mental health disorders (anxiety, depression and disruptive behaviour disorders) have not been systematically evaluated in young people with epilepsy despite their high prevalence in this population. The aim of this multi-site randomised controlled trial is to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of adding a modular psychological intervention to usual care for the mental health disorders in comparison to assessment-enhanced usual care alone. METHODS: In total, 334 participants aged 3–18 years attending epilepsy services will be screened for mental health disorders with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the diagnostic Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA). Those identified as having a mental health disorder and consenting to the trial will be randomised to either receive up to 22 sessions of the modular psychological intervention (MATCH-ADTC) delivered over the telephone over 6 months by non-mental health professionals in addition to usual care or to assessment-enhanced usual care alone. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6 months and 12 months post-randomisation. It is hypothesised that MATCH-ADTC plus usual care will be superior to assessment-enhanced usual care in improving emotional and behavioural symptoms. The primary outcome is the SDQ reported by parents at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include parent-reported mental health measures such as the Revised Children’s Anxiety and Depression Scale, quality of life measures such as the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory and physical health measures such as the Hague Seizure Severity Scale. Outcome assessors will be blinded to group assignment. Qualitative process evaluations and a health economic evaluation will also be completed. DISCUSSION: This trial aims to determine whether a systematic and integrated approach to the identification and treatment of mental health disorders in children and young people with epilepsy is clinically and cost-effective.

This condition typically has a benign character that limits itself, and supportive therapy is all that is needed; however, life-threatening consequences may occur, such as upper respiratory tract obstruction, esophageal injury, and tracheal damage, requiring surgery. We report here a man aged 19 years who coughed vigorously due to acute allergic asthma, which lead to subcutaneous emphysema starting from the neck down to the chest, mediastinum and spinal epidural space. This case report stresses the importance of including SPM in the differential diagnosis of cough and chest pain in the young. (www.actabiomedica.it)","Yılmaz, Fevzi; Zortuk, Ökkeş",Acta Biomed,64,3

In selected patients, inhaled short-acting beta-agonist administration by parents may promote comfort, constitute an educational opportunity for the family, and safely reduce provider workload. Our objective was to evaluate parental satisfaction and perceived safety of this new approach. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study, conducted in a tertiary pediatric ED. We investigated patient and parent perspectives on a newly implemented parental short-acting beta-agonist administration program. A convenience sample of families participating in this program was approached for study enrolment. The primary outcome was the proportion of parents and children who were satisfied with the program. We also evaluated the program's safety and impact on asthma education as reported by parents. RESULTS: From February 2019 to March 2020, 72 of 74 (97%) families approached for enrolment participated in the survey. A vast majority (95%) of parents appreciated the program and 93% would participate again. Among children > 7 years, 86% preferred receiving inhaled short-acting beta-agonist by their parents rather than by a healthcare provider. Nearly all parents (96%) found the program to be “safe” or “very safe”. Some participants reported improvements in their inhaler administration technique (25%) and ability to recognize their child’s respiratory distress (25%). CONCLUSION: A novel parental short-acting beta-agonist administration program in the pediatric ED was widely appreciated by participating families. Parents perceived it as being safe, educational, and contributing to their child’s comfort.

Results of this analysis are shown in practical tables, easy to understand for daily routine consultation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite [(18)F]FDG is currently used in several inflammatory and infective diseases, standardized interpretation criteria are still needed in most cases. It is, therefore, foreseen the execution of multicentre clinical studies that, by adopting the same acquisition and interpretation criteria, may contribute to the standardization of this imaging modality.","Signore, Alberto; Casali, Massimiliano; Lauri, Chiara",Clin Transl Imaging,64,1

OBJECTIVE: To delineate the integrative regulatory actions governing inflammation and metabolism in endothelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Metabolomic profiling, glucose labeling and tracing, and Seahorse extracellular flux analyses revealed that the inflammatory mediators, TNFα (tumor necrosis factor alpha) and lipopolysaccharide, extensively reprogram cellular metabolism and particularly enhance glycolysis, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and the pentose phosphate pathway in primary human arterial endothelial cells. Mechanistically, the enhancement in glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway is mediated by activation of the NF-κB (nuclear factor-kappa B)–PFKFB3 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase 3) axis and upregulation of G6PD (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase), respectively, while enhanced OXPHOS was attributed to suppression of the FOXO1 (forkhead box O1)-PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4) axis. Restoration of the FOXO1-PDK4 axis attenuated the TNFα- or lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in OXPHOS but worsened inflammation in vitro, whereas enhancement of OXPHOS by pharmacological blockade of PDKs attenuated inflammation in mesenteric vessels of lipopolysaccharide-treated mice. Notably, suppression of G6PD expression or its activity potentiated the metabolic shift to glycolysis or endothelial inflammation, while inhibition of the NF-κB–PFKFB3 signaling, conversely, blunted the increased glycolysis or inflammation in in vitro and in vivo sepsis models. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that inflammatory mediators modulate the metabolic fates of glucose and that stimulation of glycolysis promotes inflammation, whereas enhancement of OXPHOS and the pentose phosphate pathway suppresses inflammation in the endothelium. Characterization of these immunometabolic phenotypes may have implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of many cardiovascular diseases.","Xiao, Wusheng; Oldham, William M.; Priolo, Carmen; Pandey, Arvind K.; Loscalzo, Joseph",Circ Res,64,3

Referrals for primary care services to central hospitals add to growing lists and delays the time-sensitive treatment of childhood hearing loss. AIM: To compare a centralised tertiary model of hearing healthcare with a decentralised model through district hearing screening for children in the Western Cape province, South Africa. SETTING: A central paediatric tertiary hospital in Cape Town and a district hospital in the South Peninsula region. METHODS: A pragmatic quasi-experimental study design was used with a 7-month control period at a tertiary hospital (June 2019 to December 2019). Decentralising was measured by attendance rates, travelling distance, number of referrals to the tertiary hospital and hearing outcomes. There were 315 children in the tertiary group and 158 in the district group. Data were collected from patient records and an electronic database at the tertiary hospital. RESULTS: Attendance rate at the district hospital was significantly higher (p < 0.001). Travel distance to the district hospital was significantly shorter (p < 0.001). Number of referrals to the tertiary hospital decreased significantly during the intervention period (p < 0.001). Most children in both the tertiary and district groups (78.7% and 80.4%, respectively) passed initial hearing screening bilaterally. CONCLUSION: Hearing screening should be conducted at the appropriate level of care to increase access, reduce patient travelling distances and associated costs and reduce the burden on tertiary-level hospitals.","Kuschke, Silva; le Roux, Talita; Scott, Alex J.; Swanepoel, Daniel C. d.W.",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,64,0

METHODS: In each trial, RECLAIM and RECLAIM 3 (cIAI; NCT01499290/NCT01726023), REPRISE (cIAI/cUTI; NCT01644643), RECAPTURE (cUTI; NCT01595438/NCT01599806), and REPROVE (HAP/VAP; NCT01808092), patients were randomized 1:1 to intravenous ceftazidime-avibactam (plus metronidazole for those with cIAI) or comparators (carbapenems in > 97% patients) for 5–21 days. Efficacy assessments included clinical and microbiological responses at the test-of-cure visit in the pooled Gram-negative extended microbiologically evaluable (GNeME) population (bacteremia subset). Safety outcomes were summarized for patients with positive bacterial blood culture(s) at baseline who received ≥ 1 dose of study treatment. RESULTS: The overall safety population included 4050 patients (ceftazidime-avibactam, n = 2024; comparator, n = 2026). The GNeME population (bacteremia subset) comprised 101 patients (ceftazidime-avibactam, n = 54; comparator, n = 47). Clinical cure rates (all indications combined) were 47/54 (87.0%) for ceftazidime-avibactam and 39/47 (83.0%) for comparators; favorable microbiological response rates were 43/54 (79.6%) and 32/47 (68.1%), respectively. Clinical and microbiological responses in the bacteremia subset were generally similar to those in the overall set. The pattern of adverse events in patients with bacteremia was similar between treatment groups and was consistent with the known safety profile of ceftazidime-avibactam.

Dysregulated immune pathways commonly found in both sepsis and diabetes contribute to worsen the host response in diabetic patients with sepsis. The impact of diabetes on mortality from sepsis is still controversial. Whereas a substantial proportion of severe infections can be attributed to poor glycemic control, treatment with insulin, metformin and thiazolidinediones may be associated with lower incidence and mortality for sepsis. It has been suggested that chronic exposure to high glucose might enhance immune adaptation, leading to reduced mortality rate in septic diabetic patients. On the other hand, higher risk of acute kidney injury has been extensively documented and a suggested lower risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome has been recently questioned. Additional investigations are ongoing to confirm the protective role of some anti-diabetic treatments, the occurrence of acute organ dysfunction, and the risk/benefit of less stringent glycemic control in diabetic patients experiencing sepsis. Based on a MEDLINE/PubMed search from inception to December 31, 2020, the aim of this review is therefore to summarize the strengths and weaknesses of current knowledge on the interplay between diabetes and sepsis.","Costantini, Elisa; Carlin, Massimiliano; Porta, Massimo; Brizzi, Maria Felice",Acta Diabetol,64,3

Despite the increase in health research productivity over the past several decades, HRS Capacity (HRSC) in Palestine and in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has rarely been objectively evaluated. This study aims at eliciting the perceptions of HRS performers in Palestine in order to understand the status of HRSC, identify gaps, and generate policies and solutions capable of strengthening HRSC in Palestine. Methods: Key informants from three sectors, namely government, academia, and local and international organizations, were selected purposively based on different sampling methods: criterion, critical case, snowball, and homogeneous sampling. Fifty-two in-depth interviews with key informants and a total of fifty-two individuals, participating in six focus groups, were conducted by the principal investigator in Palestine. Data were analyzed by using MAXQDA 12. Results: The overall pattern of the Palestinian HRSC is relatively weak. The key findings revealed that while HR productivity in Palestine is improving, HRQS is at an average level and quality guidelines are not followed due to paucity of understanding, policies, and resources. HRKTD is a central challenge with both a dearth of conceptualization of translational science and inadequate implementation. The factors related to inadequate HRKTD include lack of awareness on the part of the researchers, inadequate regulatory frameworks and mechanisms for both communication and collaboration between and among researchers and policy-makers and clinicians, and lack of availability of, and credibility in, systematized and reliable HR data. Despite the limited knowledge translation, in general, HRTUDP is not considered an essential decision-making methodology mainly due to the lack of interface between knowledge producers (researchers) and users (policymakers), understanding level, HR credibility and availability of applied research, and governance, resources, and political fluctuations. Recommendations to strengthen HRS in Palestine include: a consolidated research regulatory framework and an effective capacity strengthening strategy overseen by Palestinian authorities; the promotion of HRQS and concepts and practices of translational science; and, most importantly, the use of findings for evidence-based policies and practice. Conclusion: Strengthening HRSC is both an imperative step and an opportunity to improve the Palestinian health system and ensure it is based on research evidence and knowledge. Building a successful HRS characterized by capacities of high-quality research and well-disseminated and translated knowledge is a prerequisite to effective health systems and services. This can be achieved by political commitment to support such strengthening, a consolidated leadership and governance structure, and a strong operational capacity strengthening strategy.","AlKhaldi, Mohammed; Meghari, Hamza; Jillson, Irene Anne; Alkaiyat, Abdulsalam; Tanner, Marcel",Int J Public Health,64,3

This provides an opportunity for the gastroenterologist to intervene early with an effective weight-loss therapy. We evaluated the outcomes of a multifaceted, community-based gastroenterologist-supervised weight management program compared with patient-directed weight-loss efforts after physician advice. The program is aimed at achieving a 10% total body weight (TBW) loss at three months, a known determinant for NAFLD regression. Methods This is a retrospective pre- and post-intervention study of NAFLD patients, who participated in a medically supervised weight management program in the period between May 2017 and May 2019. The program is comprised of a very-low-calorie (800 kcal/day) meal replacement diet, a recommended medical fitness program, and weekly behavioral support groups. Patients are followed on monthly basis and slowly transitioned to a whole food plant-based or Mediterranean diet after three months of participation. Patients’ weight trends driven by self-directed efforts to lose weight after physician advice were collected based on historical data up to two years prior to program participation. The primary outcome was defined as percentage TBW loss at three months under medical supervision (post-intervention) compared with patient-directed weight-loss efforts (pre-intervention). The secondary outcomes included percentage TBW loss in relation to behavioral support group attendance and improvement in GERD and T2DM disease status after program participation. Linear mixed and linear regression models were used to assess for a statistically significant difference in percentage TBW loss. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Results A total of 114 NAFLD patients (mean age 55 years, mean BMI 39 kg/m(2), 77 females, and 37 males) completed at least three months of follow-up and were included in the study. Of those, 89 patients had a documented three-month office visit. At three months, 65% of patients had lost at least 10% of their TBW. Percentage TBW loss under medical supervision was noted to be significantly higher and occurred at a faster rate over three months when compared with patient-directed efforts after physician advice (p < 0.001). Patients who attended the behavioral support groups ≥ 50% of the time had a 3% higher TBW loss at three months compared with patients who attended <50% of the time (p = 0.006). Approximately, 52% of patients with GERD and 38% of patients with T2DM had symptoms improvement and/or medication reduction at their three-month follow-up visit. Conclusion A multifaceted, community-based, gastroenterologist supervised weight management program is effective in achieving a clinically significant TBW loss of at least 10% within three months of participation. This weight loss was greater and occurred at a faster rate when compared with patient-directed efforts. Additionally, improvement in GERD and T2DM disease status was noted in 52% and 38% of patients with these conditions, respectively. Further community-based studies of a larger scale are needed to determine the sustainability of this weight loss over one year.","Hawa, Fadi; Gladshteyn, Mark; Gunaratnam, Sejal V; Scheidel, Caleb; Corsello, Paul M; Berger, Stephen H; Gunaratnam, Naresh T",,64,1

Whether positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) confers lung protection during ECMO for severe ARDS is unclear. We compared the effects of three different PEEP levels whilst applying near-apnoeic ventilation in a model of severe ARDS treated with ECMO. METHODS: Acute respiratory distress syndrome was induced in anaesthetised adult male pigs by repeated saline lavage and injurious ventilation for 1.5 h. After ECMO was commenced, the pigs received standardised near-apnoeic ventilation for 24 h to maintain similar driving pressures and were randomly assigned to PEEP of 0, 10, or 20 cm H(2)O (n=7 per group). Respiratory and haemodynamic data were collected throughout the study. Histological injury was assessed by a pathologist masked to PEEP allocation. Lung oedema was estimated by wet-to-dry-weight ratio. RESULTS: All pigs developed severe ARDS. Oxygenation on ECMO improved with PEEP of 10 or 20 cm H(2)O, but did not in pigs allocated to PEEP of 0 cm H(2)O. Haemodynamic collapse refractory to norepinephrine (n=4) and early death (n=3) occurred after PEEP 20 cm H(2)O. The severity of lung injury was lowest after PEEP of 10 cm H(2)O in both dependent and non-dependent lung regions, compared with PEEP of 0 or 20 cm H(2)O. A higher wet-to-dry-weight ratio, indicating worse lung injury, was observed with PEEP of 0 cm H(2)O. Histological assessment suggested that lung injury was minimised with PEEP of 10 cm H(2)O. CONCLUSIONS: During near-apnoeic ventilation and ECMO in experimental severe ARDS, 10 cm H(2)O PEEP minimised lung injury and improved gas exchange without compromising haemodynamic stability.","Araos, Joaquin; Alegria, Leyla; Garcia, Aline; Cruces, Pablo; Soto, Dagoberto; Erranz, Benjamín; Salomon, Tatiana; Medina, Tania; Garcia, Patricio; Dubó, Sebastián; Bachmann, María C.; Basoalto, Roque; Valenzuela, Emilio D.; Rovegno, Maximiliano; Vera, Magdalena; Retamal, Jaime; Cornejo, Rodrigo; Bugedo, Guillermo; Bruhn, Alejandro",Br J Anaesth,64,3

Artemis is phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs and acts to open DNA hairpin intermediates generated during V(D)J and class-switch recombination. Artemis deficiency leads to congenital radiosensitive severe acquired immune deficiency (RS-SCID). Artemis belongs to a superfamily of nucleases containing metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) and β-CASP (CPSF-Artemis-SNM1-Pso2) domains. We present crystal structures of the catalytic domain of wildtype and variant forms of Artemis, including one causing RS-SCID Omenn syndrome. The catalytic domain of the Artemis has similar endonuclease activity to the phosphorylated full-length protein. Our structures help explain the predominantly endonucleolytic activity of Artemis, which contrasts with the predominantly exonuclease activity of the closely related SNM1A and SNM1B MBL fold nucleases. The structures reveal a second metal binding site in its β-CASP domain unique to Artemis, which is amenable to inhibition by compounds including ebselen. By combining our structural data with that from a recently reported Artemis structure, we were able model the interaction of Artemis with DNA substrates. The structures, including one of Artemis with the cephalosporin ceftriaxone, will help enable the rational development of selective SNM1 nuclease inhibitors.","Yosaatmadja, Yuliana; Baddock, Hannah T; Newman, Joseph A; Bielinski, Marcin; Gavard, Angeline E; Mukhopadhyay, Shubhashish M M; Dannerfjord, Adam A; Schofield, Christopher J; McHugh, Peter J; Gileadi, Opher",Nucleic Acids Res,64,3

Up to 5% of the population is affected. AIRDs include rheumatoid arthritis, system lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and Sjögren’s syndrome. In patients with autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks structures of its own body, leading to widespread tissue and organ damage, which, in turn, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. One third of the mortality associated with autoimmune diseases is due to cardiovascular diseases. Atherosclerosis is considered the main underlying cause of cardiovascular diseases. Currently, because of finding macrophages and lymphocytes at the atheroma, atherosclerosis is considered a chronic immune-inflammatory disease. In active inflammation, the liberation of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrotic factor alpha (TNFa), interleukine-6 (IL-6), IL-1 and other factors like T and B cells, play a major role in the atheroma formation. In addition, antioxidized, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) antibodies, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and rheumatoid factor (RF) are higher in the atherosclerotic patients. Traditional risk factors like gender, age, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, however, do not alone explain the risk of atherosclerosis present in autoimmune diseases. This review examines the role of chronic inflammation in the etiology—and progression—of atherosclerosis in autoimmune rheumatic diseases. In addition, discussed here in detail are the possible effects of autoimmune rheumatic diseases that can affect vascular function.

We used a precise viral quantitation method, reverse transcription-digital PCR (RT-dPCR), to characterize the role of viral load in clinical outcomes and in viral co-infections in children presenting to a tertiary hospital emergency department (ED). METHODS: Children < 18 years with respiratory symptoms for ≤ 14 days were enrolled from December 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018. Participants had nasal and throat specimens obtained and multiplex PCR testing with a commercial assay (FilmArray; bioMerieux). RV positive samples were quantified using RT-dPCR. Samples with sufficient viral load were sequenced at a 543 bp fragment of the RV VP4/VP2 region. RV species were assigned by comparison to RV sequences in GenBank using BLAST. Clinical data were collected into REDCap. T-tests were used to compare mean viral loads between groups. RESULTS: Of 1703 children enrolled in the ED, 697 were RV/enterovirus positive by FilmArray [median age 18 months (interquartile range 9–39 months)]. Of 590 subjects with viral load available, 276 (47%) were admitted to the hospital. Among RV mono-infections (N = 434), mean viral load did not differ between subjects admitted vs. discharged from the ED (7.03 log copies/mL for both, P = 0.97). Among admitted subjects with RV mono-infection, viral load also did not differ between subjects requiring supplemental oxygen vs. not (7.01 vs. 7.10 log copies/mL, P = 0.6). Subjects with viral co-infections had lower mean RV viral loads (6.31 log copies/mL) compared with those with RV only (7.03 log copies/mL; P < 0.001) (figure). Significantly different RV viral loads were seen with co-infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus (MPV) and parainfluenza (PIV), but not with influenza, adenovirus or coronavirus. In 525 sequenced samples (46% RV-A, 4% RV-B, 50% RV-C), viral load did not vary between RV viral species (P = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Precise viral quantitation demonstrates children co-infected with RV and RSV, MPV or PIV have lower nasal viral loads than those with RV alone. Among RV mono-infections, RV viral load was not associated with admission or need for supplemental oxygen.

Studies have suggested that chronic pain pathogenesis involves neuroimmune interactions and blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB) disruption. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We modeled neuropathic pain in rats by inducing chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve and analyzed the effects on C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10)/CXCR3 activation, BSCB permeability, and immune cell migration from the circulation into the spinal cord. We detected CXCR3 expression in spinal neurons and observed that CCI induced CXCL10/CXCR3 activation, BSCB disruption, and mechanical hyperalgesia. CCI-induced BSCB disruption enabled circulating T cells to migrate into the spinal parenchyma. Intrathecal administration of an anti-CXCL10 antibody not only attenuated CCI-induced hyperalgesia, but also reduced BSCB permeability, suggesting that CXCL10 acts as a key regulator of BSCB integrity.

Today, a large share of enzyme products is manufactured using recombinant microorganisms. This chapter focuses on major industrial fungal species belonging to the ascomycetes like Aspergillus niger, A. oryzae, and Trichoderma reesei. Many of the commercially available recombinant enzymes are manufactured using fungi. Examples of fungal enzymes used in food products are described. The enzyme industry is to a large extent cost-driven, so the enzyme product needs to meet strict COGS (cost of goods sold) targets. Therefore, the cell factory must be very efficient to produce the enzyme in high titers and efficiently utilize raw materials. Secondly, it must be designed for a robust and generic fermentation process. When developing fungal hosts for enzyme production, several properties of the system need to be considered relating to efficiency of the cell factory, purity of the product, and safety of both the cell factory and the product. Purity is secured by engineering of the cell factory, and properties related to safety must also be engineered into the fungal host. The methods used for strain improvement are continuously being developed to increase yields and are described herein. More automation using precision tools for modification of the genome (i.e., CRISPR) and low-cost sequencing have vastly expanded the possibilities and enabled fast strain development. Using systems biology approaches, better understanding of cellular processes is now possible enabling advanced engineering of fungal cell factories. Surprisingly, a survey of innovation in the field revealed a decrease in the number of patent applications in recent years. Finally, the requirements for enzyme approval, especially in food and feed, have increased significantly worldwide in the last few years.

Its incidence rate appears to have increased substantially in Western societies during the mid-20th century and continues to increase at ∼1%/year. Worldwide cALL appears to track with affluence of societies. The ‘delayed infection’ hypothesis, first formulated in 1988, parallels the hygiene hypothesis and has an evolutionary foundation in the concept of a mismatch between prior genetic selection and programming (of the immune system) and contemporary social circumstances. In essence, the hypothesis predicts that ALL is triggered by an abnormal immune response to one or more common microbial infections and that the abnormality arises for two reasons: (i) infectious exposures being delayed beyond the immunologically anticipated period of infancy; (ii) some degree of inherited genetic susceptibility via, for example, allelic variation in genes involved in the MHC and/or immune response network. The hypothesis also has a framework in the underlying cell and molecular biology of ALL and its natural history. Epidemiological studies of social contacts in infancy (as a proxy for common infections) and risk of ALL provide indirect but strong support for the hypothesis. The idea still requires mechanistic and genetic endorsement and the appropriate studies are in progress.","Greaves, Mel",The Hygiene Hypothesis and Darwinian Medicine,64,3

The spike is a type 1 viral fusion protein, a class of trimeric surface glycoprotein proteins from diverse viral families that share many common structural and functional characteristics. Fusion proteins are mainly responsible for host cell receptor recognition and subsequent membrane fusion, and may perform other roles such as virus assembly and release via budding. The conformational changes that occur in the spike of intact SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) when it binds to the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are described. Clues to the structural/functional relationships of membrane fusion have been made possible by the development of viral purification and inactivation methods, along with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and three-dimensional (3D) image processing of many different images containing multiple views of the spikes. These methods have allowed study of the spikes while still attached to virions that are noninfectious, but fusionally competent. The receptor-binding and fusion core domains within the SARS-CoV spike have been precisely localized within the spike. Receptor binding results in structural changes that have been observed in the spike molecule, and these appear to be the initial step in viral membrane fusion. A working model for the stepwise process of receptor binding, and subsequent membrane fusion in SARS-CoV is presented. Uniquely, the large size of the SARS-CoV spike allows structural changes to be observed by cryo-EM in the native state. This provides a useful model for studying the basic process of membrane fusion in general, which forms an essential part of the function of many cellular processes.","Beniac, Daniel R.; Booth, Timothy F.",Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus,64,16

Current popular supervised methods for keyphrase extraction commonly cannot effectively utilize the long-range contextual information in text. In this paper, we focus on how to effectively exploit the long-range contextual information to improve the keyphrase extraction performance. Specifically, we propose a multi-level memory network with the conditional random fields (CRFs), which allows to have unrestricted access to the long-range and local contextual information in text. We first design the multi-level memory network with sentence level and document level to enhance the text representation. Then, we integrate the multi-level memory network with the CRFs, which has an advantage in modeling the local contextual information. Compared with the recent state-of-the-art methods, our model can achieve better results through experiments on two datasets.","Zhou, Tao; Zhang, Yuxiang; Zhu, Haoxiang",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,64,3

The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement stratified by body mass index (BMI, kg/m^2). METHODS: The Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease registry captured 4780 aortic valve replacements in Alberta, Canada from January 2004 to December 2018. All recipients were stratified by BMI into five groups (BMI: < 20, 20–24.9, 25–29.9, 30–34.9, and > = 35). Log-rank test and Cox regression were used to examine the crude and adjusted survival differences. RESULTS: Intra-operative clamp time and pump time were similar among the five groups. Significant statistical differences between groups existed for the incidence of isolated AVR, AVR and CABG, hemorrhage, septic infection, and deep sternal infection (p < 0.05). While there was no significant statistical difference in the mortality rate across the BMI groups, the underweight AVR patients (BMI < 20) were associated with increased hazard ratio (1.519; 95% confidence interval: 1.028–2.245) with regards to all-cause mortality at the longest follow-up compared with normal weight patients.

However, there are few studies comparing anidulafungin and micafungin in terms of efficacy and safety. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety between anidulafungin and micafungin treatment for adult patients with candidemia. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study performed on adult candidemia patients diagnosed from January 2006 through December 2018 at a tertiary medical center. The study subjects included adult patients ≥ 19 years with candidemia who were only treated with anidulafungin or micafungin for ≥ 3 days. Clinical characteristics were collected and analyzed. Hepatotoxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. RESULTS: A total of 98 patients with candidemia were treated with anidulafungin (n = 52, 53.1%) or micafungin (n = 46, 46.9%). There were no significant differences in age, sex, source of candidemia, and comorbidities between the anidulafungin and micafungin groups. Although there were more patients with abnormal baseline liver function test (LFT) in the anidulafungin group, the rate of clinical response (51.9% vs. 46.7%), mycological response (76.9% vs. 67.4%), and mortality (30-day mortality 26.9% vs. 21.7% and 90-day mortality 78.8% vs. 73.9%) was similar between the anidulafungin and micafungin groups. Also, there was no significant difference in terms of hepatotoxicity, even among the patients with abnormal baseline LFT between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that clinical efficacy and safety may be similar between anidulafungin and micafungin treatment for adult patients with candidemia.

To assess the progress of sustainable development, a simple but comprehensive index is of great use. To this end, a multivariate index of sustainable development was developed in this study based on indicators of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To demonstrate the usability of this developed index, we applied it to Fujian Province, China. According to the China SDGs indicators and the Fujian situation, we divided the SDGs into three dimensions and selected indicators based on these dimensions. We calculated the weights and two indices with the entropy weight coefficient method based on collecting and processing of data from 2007 to 2017. We assessed and analyzed the sustainable development of Fujian with two indices and we drew three main conclusions. From 2007 to 2017, the development index of Fujian showed an increasing trend and the coordination index of Fujian showed a fluctuating trend. It is difficult to smoothly improve the coordination index of Fujian because the development speeds of Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and Goal 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) were low. The coordination index of Fujian changed from strong coordination to medium coordination from 2011 to 2012 because the development speed of the environmental dimension suddenly improved. It changed from strong coordination to medium coordination from 2015 to 2016 because the values of the development index of the social dimension were decreasing. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first SDGs-based multivariate indices of sustainable development for a region of China. These indices are applicable to different regions.","Wang, Xiangyu; Gao, Peichao; Song, Changqing; Cheng, Changxiu",Entropy (Basel),64,16

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Mexico was on February 28, 2020, and currently, there are more than 150,300 confirmed cases and more than 17,500 deaths have been reported, this work presents the characteristics of the first cases on a tertiary care center with special focus on common comorbidities in Mexicans. METHODS: We conducted a case series of patients with the diagnosis of pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 virus admitted to a tertiary care center in Mexico City, between March 14th and May 4th, 2020. Data collected included demographic information, comorbidities, clinical presentation, and outcomes. Regarding clinical outcomes, we measured the need of admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), mortality during hospitalization, discharge, and patients that remained hospitalized. RESULTS: 85 patients were included, median age 53.5 years; 69.4% were male. Most common clinical manifestations at admission were fever (61, 71.8%), cough (29, 34.1%), headache (25, 29.4%) and dyspnea (22, 25.9%). Most common comorbidities were overweight (44/82, 53.6%), obesity (25/82, 30.5%), hypertension (18, 21.2%), and diabetes (17, 20%). 31 of 85 (36.5%) patients were diagnosed with critical disease, whereas 54 of 85 (63.5%) were classified as non-critical. In the 31 critically ill patients, the length of invasive mechanical ventilation was 13 days [range {2–45}]; 5 patients (16.1%) required tracheostomy. The mean of mechanical ventilation prior to tracheostomy was 19.8 days [range {14–25}]. In all patients, the total length of hospitalization was 12.1 days [range {2–52}], 14.8 days [range {3–52}] in ICU patients, and 6.7 days [range {2–30}] in floor unit patients. No readmissions were documented. Global mortality was 4.7% (9.6% in ICU, 1.8% in floor unit).

The partner, in fact, is the main source of support, but his/her support may sometimes be inadequate. In addition, dyadic coping (i.e., the way partners cope together against stress and support each other in times of difficulty) could likely be a moderating factor. The main aim of the present study was to examine the role that dyadic coping (DC, in terms of positive, negative, and common dyadic coping responses) plays in moderating the link between patient and partner cardiac illness-related distress (in terms of anxiety and depression) and partner support (in terms of overprotection, hostility, and partner support for patient engagement). The study included 100 married couples faced with cardiac illness who completed a self-report questionnaire. We analyzed our data in PROCESS using multiple regressions in order to assess the moderating effects of DC responses in the relationship between the couple’s cardiac illness-related distress and partner support. With regard to patient distress, results showed that higher levels of patient anxiety and depression were linked with ineffective partner support (i.e., overprotection and hostility). With regard to partner distress, higher levels of partner depression were linked with hostility; higher levels of partner depression and anxiety were associated with less partner support for patient engagement. Moreover, the association between distress and partner support was moderated by the quality of DC. In particular, low positive DC represented a risk factor for both the patient and the partner during a cardiac illness, as low positive DC exacerbated the link between patient and partner distress and less effective partner support styles. Also, higher levels of negative DC were risky for couples: The association between distress and less adequate partner supportive behaviors was stronger in the case of higher negative DC. These results imply a need for psychosocial interventions for couples in cardiac illness, especially for couples lacking relational competences, such as positive dyadic coping.","Rapelli, Giada; Donato, Silvia; Pagani, Ariela Francesca; Parise, Miriam; Iafrate, Raffaella; Pietrabissa, Giada; Giusti, Emanuele Maria; Castelnuovo, Gianluca; Bertoni, Anna",Front Psychol,64,5

The present investigation carried out during Oct–Dec 2019 attempts to assess the parameters, such as quality of groundwater and soil along three depths (0–5, 5–15 and 15–30 cm), in proximity to a dumping site in Silchar, a rapidly evolving city of North-East India. Standard protocols of soil and water quality assessments were carried out. The pH values of the surface soils were found to be slightly acidic. Decrease in acidity with increasing depth was observed in the study site. The relative abundance of the analyzed elements at all soil depths was Zn > Fe > Ni > Cu > Cr. Weak correlation between the concentration of Cu, Fe and Zn, and the bulk density of the soil highlighted the micronutrient status of the soil. The impact of the nearby dumpsite on trace element contamination is indicated by the ‘extremely contaminated’ status of the soils with respect to geo-accumulation index. Majority of the groundwater samples exhibited pH levels below the desired limits, making it unfit for consumption by local communities. While Fe, Cu and Ni levels in groundwater samples exceeded the guideline values, Cr and Zn concentrations were found to be within limits except one sample. Principal Component Analysis of the observed data was carried out to ascertain the predominant sources of contamination. The observations indicate the negative impacts of nearby dumpsite on environmental parameters, such as groundwater and soil quality, as highlighted in this research.

All the dreams of immateriality and exclusion from state power had to recede from a reality of internet infrastructures that became more and more massive, resource consuming and dominant. What developed into the metaphor of The Cloud at the same time settled as a highly influential new power rivalling with democratic institutions of the state on its territory. According to Galloway it is the new means of power, the protocol, that reigns technology and society. The key question of this paper is if there is a close connection between the family of internet protocols and the regulatory means of state. My tentative answer is: yes, indeed, there are close connections between the two spheres that seemingly were incompatible: heaven (The Cloud) and earth (the state territory) couple strongly. The approach is done by Luhmannian Systems Theory, the term being “interpenetration” and “structural coupling”. The example will be the Chinese Social Credit System. The main thesis is that the Chinese Social Credit System couples its protocol to the laws and regulations of state and economy, also conceptualized as being protocols, via the internet as its common language. It turns out that the coupling and interpenetration could be highly efficient thus for the first time enabling a co evolution of a highly mobile turbo capitalist economy and a strict authoritarian state territory, a marriage between heaven and earth.","Warnke, Martin",Human-Centric Computing in a Data-Driven Society,64,1

Countries utilize capacity building for military affairs, economics, and administration for cyber deterrence. Even though the circumstances of cybersecurity are deeply affected by the deterrence theory of Realism, concepts of capacity building for cybersecurity are derived not only from Realism but also from Liberalism and Constructivism.

The use of IMV without ICU admission (non-ICU) in acute care hospitals in the US and its impact on patients' outcomes were not examined. METHODS A retrospective cohort study was performed using statewide inpatient data in Texas to identify hospitalizations aged ≥18 years receiving IMV in acute care hospitals with ICU care capability during January 2014 through September 2015. Use of non-ICU IMV, patient characteristics, and hospital mortality were examined. RESULTS Among 136,728 IMV hospitalizations, 4531 (3.3%) were non-ICU. As compared to ICU admissions, non-ICU IMV hospitalizations were younger (age 18-44 years: 24.9% vs. 17.2%), with lower burden of major comorbidities (no major comorbidity: 24.7% vs. 14.5%), and lower occurrence of non-respiratory organ failures (no non-respiratory organ failure: 32.7% vs. 19.8%). Risk-adjusted hospital mortality of non-ICU vs. ICU IMV hospitalizations was 48.7% (95% CI 48.1-49.4) and 29.9% (95% CI 29.8-30.0), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Non-ICU IMV was provided in 1 in 30 IMV hospitalizations in acute care hospitals. Although non-ICU IMV hospitalizations were younger and healthier than those admitted to ICU, their hospital mortality was markedly higher.","Oud, Lavi; Garza, John",Journal of critical care,64,8

Although factors that predispose to postoperative renal dysfunction have been identified, this knowledge has not been associated with a substantial reduction in the incidence of this serious adverse event. METHODS This review uses the existing literature to explore the relationship between AKI and perioperative blood pressure (BP) control in cardiac surgery patients. The results of recent novel analyses are introduced, and the implications of these studies for the management of cardiac surgery patients in the perioperative period are discussed. RESULTS Preexisting isolated systolic hypertension and wide pulse pressure increase the risk of postoperative renal dysfunction in the cardiac surgery population. New data suggest that BP lability (i.e., BP excursions outside an acceptable physiologic range) during cardiac surgery may also be an important predictor of subsequent renal dysfunction. CONCLUSION Recently published data suggest that perioperative BP lability influences both the risk of postoperative renal dysfunction and 30-day mortality. Future studies will determine whether the use of agents that allow improved BP control within a desirable range will reduce the incidence of postoperative AKI in cardiac surgery patients.","Weir, Matthew R; Aronson, Solomon; Avery, Edwin G; Pollack, Charles V",American journal of nephrology,64,1

Intraoperative cerebral and tissue saturation were 73 ± 7 and 80 ± 11%, respectively, before SA placement. NIRS measurements were monitored every minute for 30 min after SA placement and modeled using mixed-effects linear regression. Regression estimates showed that cerebral saturation remained stable from 67% [95% confidence interval (CI) 63, 71%] after SA placement to 68% (95% CI 65, 72%) at the conclusion of monitoring. After SA placement, tissue saturation was elevated compared to baseline values; but further change [from 91% (95% CI 89, 93%) to 93% (95% CI 91, 95%) at the end of monitoring] was clinically non-significant.

Secondary HLH includes infection- (e.g., viral/bacterial/fungal/parasitic) and non-infection- (e.g., collagen disease or malignancy) related diseases. Viral HLH is the major type among all age groups. Secondary viral HLH and primary HLH must be differentiated carefully because primary HLH can be associated with viral infection(s), and the outcome is dismal without a timely diagnosis and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-related HLH (EBV-HLH) is the most common type of viral HLH in childhood. For non-EBV-HLH, appropriate treatment of viral infection, followed by immunomodulatory agent(s) such as corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or cyclosporine A, is usually successful; however, recent SARS-CoV-2-related HLH may become life-threatening. EBV-HLH may occur heterogeneously associated with the primary infection, with chronic active EBV infection, or with underlying primary HLH. Although immunomodulatory agent(s) are effective in the majority of EBV-HLH cases, management differs from that of non-EBV-HLH because severe and refractory cases may require etoposide-containing HLH-1994/2004 regimens or other experimental agents. The novel agent, emapalumab (an anti-IFN-γ monoclonal antibody) can be used to treat EBV-HLH cases to avoid the risk of secondary malignancy due to etoposide.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) denotes the phase between the preclinical phase and clinical overt dementia. AD mouse models that overexpress human amyloid-β (Aβ) are used to study disease pathogenesis and to conduct drug development/testing. However, there is no direct correlation between the Aβ deposition, the age of onset and the severity of cognitive dysfunction. OBJECTIVE To detect and predict MCI when Aβ plaques start to appear in the hippocampus of an AD mouse. METHODS We trained wild-type and AD mice in a Morris water maze (WM) task with different inter-trial intervals (ITI) at 3 months of age and assessed their WM performance. Additionally, we used a classification algorithm to predict the genotype (APPtg versus wild-type) of individual mice from their respective WM data. RESULTS MCI can be empirically detected using a short-ITI protocol. We show that the ITI modulates the spatial learning of AD mice without affecting the formation of spatial memory. Finally, a simple classification algorithm such as logistic regression on WM data can give an accurate prediction of the cognitive dysfunction of a specific mouse. CONCLUSION MCI can be detected as well predicted simultaneously with the onset of Aβ deposition in the hippocampus in AD mouse model. The mild cognitive impairment prediction can be used for assessing the efficacy of a treatment.","Rai, Surya Prakash; Bascuñana, Pablo; Brackhan, Mirjam; Krohn, Markus; Möhle, Luisa; Paarmann, Kristin; Pahnke, Jens",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,64,16

Clinical results in cardiac surgery patients are controversial and may be related to the timing of administration of anaesthetics intraoperatively. OBJECTIVE We hypothesised that the cardioprotective effect of sevoflurane in coronary bypass graft surgical patients would be greater if administration during anaesthesia continued in the ICU for at least 4 h postoperatively until weaning from mechanical ventilation. DESIGN Double-blind, double-dummy, prospective, randomised and controlled clinical trial. SETTING In a single centre between June 2006 and June 2007. PATIENTS Seventy-five adult patients were assigned randomly to receive anaesthesia and postoperative sedation either with propofol (control, n = 37) or sevoflurane (n = 36). INTERVENTIONS Myocardial biomarkers were measured before surgery, at the time of admission to the intensive care unit and at 6, 24, 48 and 72 h. The need for inotropic support, and lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital were also recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Elevation of myocardial biomarkers was the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints were haemodynamic events and lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital. RESULTS Necrosis biomarkers increased significantly in the postoperative period in both groups with no significant differences at any time. Inotropic support was needed in 72.7 and 54.3% of patients in the propofol and sevoflurane groups, respectively (P = 0.086). There were no significant differences in haemodynamic variables, incidence of arrhythmias, myocardial ischaemia or and lengths of stay in the ICU and hospital between the two groups. CONCLUSION In patients undergoing coronary bypass graft surgery, continuous administration of sevoflurane as a sedative in the ICU for at least 4 h postoperatively did not yield significant improvements in the extent and time course of myocardial damage biomarkers compared to propofol.","Soro, Marina; Gallego, Lucía; Silva, Vanessa; Ballester, María T; Lloréns, Julio; Alvariño, Ana; García-Perez, María L; Pastor, Ernesto; Aguilar, Gerardo; Martí, Francisco J; Carratala, Arturo; Belda, F Javier",European journal of anaesthesiology,64,1

Numerous methods of exposure have been described, most of which utilize long skin incisions and myocutaneous flaps. Here we present our experience with gaining exposure through a small paramedian incision using a muscle-splitting technique. Design A cadaveric anatomical study was first performed to verify the feasibility of the approach. We then describe our experience with using the approach in 13 patients. A retrospective chart review was performed and data regarding pathology, imaging, and complications were collected. Results The cadaveric study confirmed that a small paramedian muscle-splitting approach allows sufficient exposure to approach many foramen magnum lesions. Our case series included 10 patients with meningioma, one brainstem glioblastoma, one posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm, and one odontoid pannus. The exposure was adequate in all cases. For the meningioma patients, six had gross total resections and four had subtotal resection because of tumor adherence to neurovascular structures. Two patients experienced postoperative cardiovascular complications. There were no new neurologic deficits, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, or wound complications.

Studies published in English between 1980 and 2016 were included if they reported preoperative and postoperative visual function in at least 5 patients with visually symptomatic paraclinoid aneurysms (cavernous segment through ophthalmic segment) treated with clipping, coiling, or FD. Neuroophthalmological assessment was used when reported, but subjective patient reports or objective visual examination findings were also acceptable. RESULTS Thirty-nine studies that included a total of 2458 patients (520 of whom presented with visual symptoms) met the inclusion criteria, including 307 visually symptomatic cases treated with clipping (mean follow-up 26 months), 149 treated with coiling (mean follow-up 17 months), and 64 treated with FD (mean follow-up 11 months). Postoperative vision in these patients was classified as improved, unchanged, or worsened compared with preoperative vision. A pooled analysis showed preoperative visual symptoms in 38% (95% CI 28%-50%) of patients with paraclinoid aneurysms. The authors found that vision improved in 58% (95% CI 48%-68%) of patients after clipping, 49% (95% CI 38%-59%) after coiling, and 71% (95% CI 55%-84%) after FD. Vision worsened in 11% (95% CI 7%-17%) of patients after clipping, 9% (95% CI 2%-18%) after coiling, and 5% (95% CI 0%-20%) after FD. New visual deficits were found in patients with intact baseline vision at a rate of 1% (95% CI 0%-3%) for clipping, 0% (95% CI 0%-2%) for coiling, and 0% (95% CI 0%-2%) for FD. CONCLUSIONS To the authors' knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to assess vision outcomes after treatment for paraclinoid aneurysms. The authors found that 38% of patients with these aneurysms presented with visual impairment. These data also demonstrated a high rate of visual improvement after FD without a significant difference in the rate of worsened vision or iatrogenic visual impairment compared with clipping and coiling. These findings suggest that FD is an effective option for treatment of visually symptomatic paraclinoid aneurysms.","Silva, Michael A; See, Alfred P; Dasenbrock, Hormuzdiyar H; Patel, Nirav J; Aziz-Sultan, Mohammad A",Neurosurgical focus,64,5

The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of LigaSure vs. Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) for LH in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with cirrhosis. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 135 HCC patients with background cirrhosis who underwent pure LH using CUSA (n = 55) or LigaSure (n = 80) for parenchymal transection between January 2015 and May 2017 at West China Hospital of Sichuan University. We performed 1:1 propensity score matching between the LigaSure and CUSA groups. Subsequently, 48 patients were included in each group. RESULTS The mean parenchymal transection time (74.3 ± 23.6 vs. 86.3 ± 25.8 min, P = 0.019) in the LigaSure group was obviously shorter than that in the CUSA group. The LigaSure did not increase the intraoperative blood loss or blood transfusion requirement when compared with CUSA. Moreover, the degree of postoperative reperfusion injury and complications were not significantly different between the two groups. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the two groups regarding 2-year overall survival rate or disease-free survival rate. In addition, the total hospitalization costs (P = 0.032) and intraoperative costs (P = 0.006) per case were significantly lower in the LigaSure group than those in the CUSA group. CONCLUSION The two devices were safe and effective for LH in patients with cirrhosis. The LigaSure method may be a simple, feasible, and cost-effective surgical technique for LH in selected HCC patients with cirrhosis.","Liu, Fei; Wei, YongGang; Li, HongYu; Wang, WenTao; Wen, TianFu; Wu, Hong; Yang, JiaYin; Xu, MingQing; Li, Bo",Surgical endoscopy,64,22

The effective triage of these patients has become challenging in the current environment as clinicians have had to weigh the risk of bringing susceptible patients into the hospital environment during the COVID-19 pandemic versus the risk of delaying a needed procedure. In this document, we suggest guidelines as to how to triage patients in need of SHD interventions and provide a framework of how to decide when it may be appropriate to proceed with intervention despite the ongoing pandemic. In particular, we address the triage of patients in need of trans-catheter aortic valve replacement and percutaneous mitral valve repair.

93374,93374,93374,Lessons learned from hospital Ebola preparation.,14.225471,11.046538,2015,"BACKGROUND To date there has been no direct comparison of two frequently used endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) methods (forced arterial suction thrombectomy (FAST) and stent retriever thrombectomy) in M2 occlusions. We review our experiences with EVT performed using FAST and stent retriever thrombectomy in such cases. METHODS The subjects comprised 41 patients with an M2 occlusion who underwent EVT (25 with FAST, 16 with stent retriever thrombectomy). The patients' data were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the technical characteristics and angiographic outcome of the two EVT techniques. RESULTS Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) grades 2b-3 using the first chosen technique did not differ significantly between the two techniques (FAST 64.0% vs stent retriever thrombectomy 81.2%, p=0.305). Time from groin puncture to reperfusion was significantly shorter for stent retriever thrombectomy (53.0 vs 38.5 min; p=0.045). Distal embolization occurred in three cases (12.0%) in the FAST group and in four (26.7%) in the stent retriever group (p=0.362). However, the two techniques did not differ significantly in the final TICI 2b-3 rate (72.0% vs 87.5%; p=0.441). A frequent angiographic finding regarding the failure of FAST was that the M2 occlusion was located immediately after severe acute angulation between M1 and M2. CONCLUSIONS Stent retriever thrombectomy may provide faster reperfusion than FAST, while the FAST technique might be associated with lower distal embolization and a higher reperfusion rate for the first thrombectomy attempt, but without any significant difference in clinical outcome. When choosing the EVT method for M2 occlusions, consideration of the location of the occlusion and tortuosity between M1 and M2 might be helpful to achieve a better angiographic outcome.","Kim, Yong-Won; Son, Seungnam; Kang, Dong-Hun; Hwang, Yang-Ha; Kim, Yong-Sun",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,64,16
94105,94105,94105,Aerosol distribution in the cabin and cockpit of an ambulance helicopter.,14.116854,11.246383,2020-06-10,"BACKGROUND Diagnostic and interventional procedures are often facilitated by moderate procedure-related sedation. Many studies support the overall safety of this sedation; however, adverse cardiovascular and respiratory events are reported in up to 70% of these procedures, more frequently in very young, very old, or sicker patients. Monitoring with pulse oximetry may underreport hypoventilation during sedation, particularly if supplemental oxygen is provided. Capnometry may result in false alarms during sedation when patients mouth breathe or displace sampling devices. Advanced monitor use during sedation may allow event detection before complications develop. This 2-part pilot study used advanced monitors during planned moderate sedation to (1) determine incidences of desaturation, low respiratory rate, and deeper than intended sedation alarm events; and (2) determine whether advanced monitor use is associated with fewer alarm events. METHODS Adult patients undergoing scheduled gastroenterology or interventional radiology procedures with planned moderate sedation given by dedicated sedation nurses under the direction of procedural physicians (procedural sedation team) were monitored per standard protocols (electrocardiography blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and capnometry) and advanced monitors (acoustic respiratory monitoring and processed electroencephalograpy). Data were collected to computers for analysis. Advanced monitor parameters were not visible to teams in part 1 (standard) but were visible to teams in part 2 (advanced). Alarm events were defined as desaturation-SpO2 ≤92%; respiratory depression, acoustic respiratory rate ≤8 breaths per minute, and deeper than intended sedation, indicated by processed electroencephalograpy. The number of alarm events was compared. RESULTS Of 100 patients enrolled, 10 were excluded for data collection computer malfunction or consent withdrawal. Data were analyzed from 90 patients (44 standard and 46 advanced). Advanced had fewer total alarms than standard (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney = 2.073, P = 0.038; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney odds, 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.88). Similar numbers of standard and advanced had ≥1 alarm event (Wald difference, -10.2%; 95% CI, -26.4% to 7.0%; P = 0.237). Fewer advanced patients had ≥1 respiratory depression event (Wald difference, -22.1%; 95% CI, -40.9% to -2.4%; P = 0.036) or ≥1 desaturation event (Wald difference, -24.2%; 95% CI, -42.8% to -3.6%; P = 0.021); but there was no significant difference in deeper than intended sedation events (Wald difference, -1.38%; 95% CI, -20.21% to 17.49%; P = 0.887). CONCLUSIONS Use of advanced monitoring parameters during planned moderate sedation was associated with fewer alarm events, patients experiencing desaturation, and patients experiencing respiratory depression alarm events. This pilot study suggests that further study into the safety and outcome impacts of advanced monitoring during procedure-related sedation is warranted.","Applegate, Richard L; Lenart, John; Malkin, Mathew; Meineke, Minhthy N; Qoshlli, Silvana; Neumann, Monica; Jacobson, J Paul; Kruger, Alison; Ching, Jeffrey; Hassanian, Mohammad; Um, Michael",Anesthesia and analgesia,64,1

Yet, the applications are limited due to the lack of the tumor-selectivity for most of the reactants. Here we explored an alternative approach to leverage the rate constant by locally inducing an in vivo catalyst. We found that the desilylation-induced cleavage chemistry could be catalyzed in vivo by cationic micelles, and accelerated over 1400-fold under physiological condition. This micelle-catalyzed controlled release platform is demonstrated by the release of a 6-hydroxyl-quinoline-2-benzothiazole derivative (HQB) in two cancer cell lines and a NIR dye in mouse tumor xenografts. Through intravenous injection of a pH-sensitive polymer micelles, we successfully applied this strategy to a prodrug activation of hydroxyl camptothecin (OH-CPT) in tumors. Its ""decaging"" efficiency is 42-fold to that without cationic micelles-mediated catalysis. This micelle-catalyzed desilylation strategy unveils the potential that micelle may act beyond a carrier but a catalyst for local perturbing or activation.","Wang, Chunhong; Hong, Hanyu; Chen, Mengqi; Ding, Zexuan; Rui, Yuchen; Qi, Jianyuan; Li, Zi-Chen; Liu, Zhibo",Angewandte Chemie,64,1

During the same period, the Norwegian Medicines Agency received 100 reports of suspected fatal adverse reactions to the vaccine. An expert group has examined the reports and assessed the extent of a causal link between vaccination and death. MATERIAL AND METHOD The expert group worked in two pairs, each of which examined 50 anonymised reports. Each member first examined the reports alone and classified the causality as unlikely, possible, probable, certain or unclassifiable. Each pair then discussed their results until they reached a consensus. All four experts assessed a random sample of 20 reports. The degree of agreement was assessed using weighted kappa and McNemar's test of symmetry. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 87.7 years (range 61-103 years). Among 100 reported deaths, a causal link to the vaccine was considered probable in 10 cases, possible in 26 and unlikely in 59. Five were unclassifiable. Weighted kappa was 0.40 and 0.38 in the two expert pairs, respectively. INTERPRETATION Most nursing home patients have a short remaining life expectancy, but vaccination may, in a few cases, have accelerated a process of dying that had already begun. Nursing home patients should still be given priority for vaccination, but the benefits versus risk must be carefully weighed up for the frailest patients.","Wyller, Torgeir Bruun; Kittang, Bård Reiakvam; Ranhoff, Anette Hylen; Harg, Pernille; Myrstad, Marius","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",64,9

In order to consider occurrence factor of PED outbreaks, we determined the whole-genome sequences of 38 PED virus (PEDV) strains from diarrheal samples collected at swine farms in 18 prefectures between 2013 and 2014 using next-generation sequencing technology. Using these data, we investigated genetic variation among the recent Japanese PEDV strains and the genetic relationships between these strains and global PEDV strains isolated recently from multiple swine-industrial countries. Eleven out of 38 PEDV strains were isolated successfully on Vero cells with trypsin treatment and subjected to genome sequence analysis. In a comparative genome analysis, we detected two novel PEDV variants, TTR-2/JPN/2014 and MYG-1/JPN/2014, with large deletions in the spike and ORF3 genes, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis based on the spike gene showed that the 38 Japanese PEDV strains were classified into two PEDV types: the North American type with high virulence (n=34) and the INDEL type (n=4). In addition, the recent Japanese PEDV isolates had a close relationship to global PEDV strains isolated in recent years than to the classical PEDV strains detected in Japan the past decades ago. Moreover, the phylogenetic dendrogram of the complete genomes also indicated that the 38 Japanese PEDV strains, including the two novel PEDV variants discovered in this study, are closely related to the PEDV strains that were widespread in the United States and Korea in 2013-2014. These findings suggest that the re-emergence of PED outbreaks since the last reported case in 2006 was caused by the introduction of recent PEDV strains to Japan from overseas.","Suzuki, Tohru; Murakami, Satoshi; Takahashi, Osamu; Kodera, Aya; Masuda, Tsuneyuki; Itoh, Sakie; Miyazaki, Ayako; Ohashi, Seiichi; Tsutsui, Toshiyuki","Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",64,31

Although the functional receptor for the virus has not been identified, multiple isolates are able to infect different cell lines. Recently, it has been shown that the human C-type lectin DC-SIGN/L-SIGN (hDC-SIGN/L-SIGN) can promote entry of several coronaviruses. Here we examined whether hDC-SIGN/L-SIGN and its porcine homolog (pDC-SIGN) are entry determinants for PEDV. Expression of hDC-SIGN/L-SIGN or pDC-SIGN in refractory cells dramatically increased infection by a recombinant PEDV expressing green fluorescent protein. In both cases, lectin-mediated infection was inhibited by mannan or anti-hDC-SIGN/L-SIGN or pDC-SIGN antibodies; however, d-galactose had no effect on the virus-infected cells. Our results demonstrate that hDC-SIGN/L-SIGN or pDC-SIGN can mediate the cellular entry and propagation of PEDV, which provides a new theoretical basis for further understanding the infection mechanism of PEDV, and will be helpful for the development of novel therapeutic agents.","Zhao, Pengwei; Xu, Ling-Dong; Zhang, Yating; Cao, Hongwei; Chen, Ruiai; Wang, Bin; Huang, Yao-Wei",Microbial pathogenesis,64,19

We measured Bragg reflections from the chiral SmC* phase of the antiferroelectric liquid crystal (AFLC), AS612, and explored how applied electric fields and polymer networks modify these reflections. From the critical field that unwinds the helix and destroys Bragg reflections, the twist elastic constant of the SmC* phase is determined. We estimate from this result, the elastic constant of polymer network, which when introduced into the liquid crystal matrix, fixes the helical pitch (and hence, Bragg peaks).

We tested for NSP4 viroporin activity from divergent strains, including RVA (EC and Ty-1), RVB (IDIR), and RVC (Cowden). Canonical viroporin motifs were identified in RVA, RVB, and RVC NSP4s, but the arrangement of basic residues and the amphipathic α-helices was substantially different between serogroups. Using Escherichia coli and mammalian cell expression, we showed that each NSP4 tested had viroporin activity, but serogroup-specific viroporin phenotypes were identified. Only mammalian RVA and RVC NSP4s induced BL21-pLysS E. coli cell lysis, a classical viroporin activity assay. In contrast, RVA, RVB, and RVC NSP4 expression was universally cytotoxic to E. coli and disrupted reduction-oxidation activities, as measured by a new redox dye assay. In mammalian cells, RVB and RVC NSP4s were initially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and trafficked into punctate structures that were mutually exclusive with RVA NSP4. The punctate structures partially localized to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) but primarily colocalized with punctate LC3, a marker for autophagosomes. Similar to RVA NSP4, expression of RVB and RVC NSP4s significantly elevated cytosolic calcium levels, demonstrating that despite strong primary sequence divergence, RV NSP4 has maintained viroporin activity across serogroups A to C. These data suggest that elevated cytosolic calcium is a common critical process for all rotavirus strains.","Hyser, Joseph M; Utama, Budi; Crawford, Sue E; Estes, Mary K",Journal of virology,64,1

We found a significant increase in perceived CBSS availability from 2005 to 2011, but the perceived availability of CBSS varies by the type of CBSS. Multivariate analyses show that home medical visits (β = .181, p = .03), psychological support (β = .332, p = .02), social and recreation activities (β = .231, p = .02), and legal consulting services (β = .271, p = .02) were each significantly associated with a good quality of life.

In the context of body-focused repetitive behaviours (BFRBs), like compulsive hair pulling (trichotillomania) and skin picking (dermatillomania), biosociality moves people from isolation towards community. After diagnosis, the powerful moment of discovering 'you are not alone' can lead to immense personal transformations, demonstrating the 'looping effects' of diagnosis and biosociality. Yet, biosocial groups do not simply exist, and must first be formed and found and their sustainability requires ongoing work and care from biosocial actors themselves. Biosociality also means different things to different people, often requiring a negotiation between secrecy and disclosure. This article acknowledges the role of stigma in biosociality, differentiating between private and public biosocial experiences. It argues that through biosociality come acts of biosolidarity, where advocacy can improve the visibility and recognition of illness groups. The circular looping effects of biosociality and biosolidarity demonstrate the way that community activism and biosociality reproduce one another. Through reflections from the anthropologist, biosolidarity is considered as a methodological tool that can help scholars to navigate the boundaries between relatedness, sociality and advocacy in the field and beyond.","Bradley, Bridget",Anthropology & medicine,64,1

The study was exploratory in nature, with its main objective consisting of inductively identifying topics embedded in user-generated content. We found that a five-topic model was the best in representing the data corpus, including: (i) the public's perception of gambling addiction amid the COVID-19 outbreak, (ii) risks and support available for those who stay at home, (iii) the users' interpretation of gambling addiction, (iv) forms of gambling during the pandemic, and (v) gambling advertising and impact on families. Sentiment analysis showed a prevalence of underlying fear, trust, sadness, and anger, across the corpus. Users viewed the pandemic as a driver of problematic gambling behaviors, possibly exposing unprepared individuals and communities to forms of online gambling, with potential long-term consequences and a significant impact on health systems. Despite the limitations of the study, we hypothesize that enhancing the presence of mental health operators and practitioners treating problem gambling on social media might positively impact public mental health and help prevent health services from being overwhelmed, in times when healthcare resources are limited.","Fino, Emanuele; Hanna-Khalil, Bishoy; Griffiths, Mark D",Journal of addictive diseases,64,26

Disconnection of the draining vein is considered curative. We present the multimodality treatment results of 35 patients with cranial DAVFs with exclusive cortical venous drainage. Materials and methods Between January 2010 and January 2017, 35 consecutive patients with cranial dural fistulas with exclusive cortical venous drainage were treated. There were 27 men and eight women, mean age 68 years (range 45-87). Clinical presentation was hemorrhage in 23 (66%), pulsatile bruit in two (6%), seizures in one (3%) and blurred vision in one (3%). In eight patients (22%), the DAVF was an incidental finding. Location of the DAVFs was convexity in 25 (71%), posterior fossa in eight (23%) and tentorium in two (6%). Results Surgery was performed in four patients with anterior cranial fossa fistulas and in one patient with a tentorial dural fistula. In 30 patients, embolization with Onyx via the arterial route was the primary treatment with complete obliteration in one session in 25 patients. Additional surgical or endovascular sessions were necessary in five patients after incomplete embolization and in one patient after incomplete surgery. Obliteration was confirmed with angiography after three months. There were no procedural complications. Conclusions Patients with dural fistulas with cortical venous drainage were cured with a strategy of arterial endovascular treatment with Onyx and surgery. These techniques were either primarily successful or complementary. There were no complications of treatment.","Kortman, H G; Bloemsma, G; Boukrab, I; Peluso, J P; Sluzewski, M; van der Pol, B; Beute, G N; Majoie, C B; van Rooij, W J","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",64,1

In healthy neurons, full-length PINK1 (fPINK1) is post-translationally cleaved into different lower molecular weight forms, and cleaved PINK1 (cPINK1) gets shuttled to the cytosolic compartments to support extra-mitochondrial functions. While numerous studies have exemplified the role of mitochondrially localized PINK1 in modulating mitophagy in oxidatively stressed neurons, little is known regarding the physiological role of cPINK1 in healthy neurons. We have previously shown that cPINK1, but not fPINK1, modulates the neurite outgrowth and the maintenance of dendritic arbors by activating downstream protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in healthy neurons. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cPINK1 promotes neurite outgrowth remain to be elucidated. In this report, we show that cPINK1 supports neuronal development by modulating the expression and extracellular release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Consistent with this role, we observed a progressive increase in the level of endogenous cPINK1 but not fPINK1 during prenatal and postnatal development of mouse brains and during development in primary cortical neurons. In cultured primary neurons, the pharmacological activation of endogenous PINK1 leads to enhanced downstream PKA activity, subsequent activation of the PKA-modulated transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), increased intracellular production and extracellular release of BDNF, and enhanced activation of the BDNF receptor-TRKβ. Mechanistically, cPINK1-mediated increased dendrite complexity requires the binding of extracellular BDNF to TRKβ. In summary, our data support a physiological role of cPINK1 in stimulating neuronal development by activating the PKA-CREB-BDNF signaling axis in a feedforward loop.","Soman, Smijin K; Tingle, David; Dagda, Raul Y; Torres, Mariana; Dagda, Marisela; Dagda, Ruben K",Journal of neuroscience research,64,11

However, results on long-term clinical outcomes are lacking. METHODS We assessed clinical outcomes 2 years after patients were randomly assigned to receive either endovascular treatment (intervention group) or conventional treatment (control group) for acute ischemic stroke. The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin scale at 2 years; this scale measures functional outcome, with scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death). Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and the quality of life at 2 years, as measured by means of a health utility index that is based on the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire (scores range from -0.329 to 1, with higher scores indicating better health). RESULTS Of the 500 patients who underwent randomization in the original trial, 2-year data for this extended follow-up trial were available for 391 patients (78.2%) and information on death was available for 459 patients (91.8%). The distribution of outcomes on the modified Rankin scale favored endovascular treatment over conventional treatment (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 2.45; P=0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups in the percentage of patients who had an excellent outcome (i.e., a modified Rankin scale score of 0 or 1). The mean quality-of-life score was 0.48 among patients randomly assigned to endovascular treatment as compared with 0.38 among patients randomly assigned to conventional treatment (mean difference, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.16; P=0.006). The cumulative 2-year mortality rate was 26.0% in the intervention group and 31.0% in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.2; P=0.46).

Little is known, however, about the feasibility, reliability, and validity of language samples when conducted via telepractice. Method Child language samples from parent-child play were recorded either in person in the laboratory or via video chat at home, using parents' preferred commercially available software on their own device. Samples were transcribed and analyzed using Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts software. Analyses compared measures between-subjects for 46 dyads who completed video chat language samples versus 16 who completed in-person samples; within-subjects analyses were conducted for a subset of 13 dyads who completed both types. Groups did not differ significantly on child age, sex, or socioeconomic status. Results The number of usable samples and percent of utterances with intelligible audio signal did not differ significantly for in-person versus video chat language samples. Child speech and language characteristics (including mean length of utterance, type-token ratio, number of different words, grammatical errors/omissions, and child speech intelligibility) did not differ significantly between in-person and video chat methods. This was the case for between-group analyses and within-child comparisons. Furthermore, transcription reliability (conducted on a subset of samples) was high and did not differ between in-person and video chat methods. Conclusions This study demonstrates that child language samples collected via video chat are largely comparable to in-person samples in terms of key speech and language measures.

The triblock precursor was designed with a fluorescence chromophore for monitoring hypoxia, a methoxy nitro-unit for biorecognition, and a poly(ethylene glycol)-folate for cancer cell targeting. As the degree of hypoxia increases, the vectors were progressively dissociated as indicated by the enhanced fluorescence intensity in hypoxic cells and compacted three-dimensional spheres. Furthermore, the expression of stem cell markers such as CD133 and SOX2 was significantly inhibited, and the serial passaging of CSCs was notably impaired after treating CSCs with the vectors. The inhibition of cancer cell stemness significantly improved the anticancer efficiency in vivo. Moreover, tumor initiation was reduced and the median survival time of xenograft tumor models was prolonged by regulating cell stemness under hypoxia.

We have identified host histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) as an anti-influenza virus factor in cultured cells. Consistent with this, we report herein that HDAC6 knockout (KO) mice are more susceptible to influenza virus A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1) infection than their wild type (WT) counterparts. The KO mice lost weight faster than the WT mice and, unlike WT mice, could not recover their original body weight. Consequently, more KO mice succumbed to infection, which corresponded with higher lung viral loads. Conversely, the expression of the critical innate antiviral response genes interferon alpha/beta, CD80, CXCL10 and IL15 was significantly downregulated in KO mouse lungs compared to WT mouse lungs. These data are consistent with the known function of HDAC6 of de-acetylating the retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and activating the host innate antiviral response cascade. Loss of HDAC6 thus leads to a blunted innate response and increased susceptibility of mice to influenza A virus infection.","Zanin, Mark; DeBeauchamp, Jennifer; Vangala, Gowthami; Webby, Richard J; Husain, Matloob",Viruses,64,1

The NCT03055715 study of the Young DEGRO working group of the German Society of Radiation Oncology (DEGRO) evaluated the prognostic impact of GTV and its changes during RCT. METHODS A total of 21 university centers for radiation oncology from five different European countries (Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, and Austria) participated in the study which evaluated n = 347 patients with confirmed (biopsy) inoperable NSCLC in UICC stage III A/B who received radical curative-intent RCT between 2010 and 2013. Patient and disease data were collected anonymously via electronic case report forms and entered into the multi-institutional RadPlanBio platform for central data analysis. GTV before RCT (initial planning CT, GTV1) and at 40-50 Gy (re-planning CT for radiation boost, GTV2) was delineated. Absolute GTV before/during RCT and relative GTV changes were correlated with overall survival as the primary endpoint. Hazard ratios (HR) of survival analysis were estimated by means of adjusted Cox regression models. RESULTS GTV1 was found to have a mean of 154.4 ml (95%CI: 1.5-877) and GTV2 of 106.2 ml (95% CI: 0.5-589.5), resulting in an estimated reduction of 48.2 ml (p < 0.001). Median overall survival (OS) was 18.8 months with a median of 22.1, 20.9, and 12.6 months for patients with high, intermediate, and low GTV before RT. Considering all patients, in one survival model of overall mortality, GTV2 (2.75 (1.12-6.75, p = 0.03) was found to be a stronger survival predictor than GTV1 (1.34 (0.9-2, p > 0.05). In patients with available data on both GTV1 and GTV2, absolute GTV1 before RT was not significantly associated with survival (HR 0-69, 0.32-1.49, p > 0.05) but GTV2 significantly predicted OS in a model adjusted for age, T stage, and chemotherapy, with an HR of 3.7 (1.01-13.53, p = 0.04) per 300 ml. The absolute decrease from GTV1 to GTV2 was correlated to survival, where every decrease by 50 ml reduced the HR by 0.8 (CI 0.64-0.99, p = 0.04). There was no evidence for a survival effect of the relative change between GTV1 and GTV2. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that independently of T stage, the re-planning GTV during RCT is a significant and superior survival predictor compared to baseline GTV before RT. Patients with a high absolute (rather than relative) change in GTV during RT show a superior survival outcome after RCT.","Ostheimer, C; Mäurer, M; Ebert, N; Schmitt, D; Krug, D; Baumann, R; Henkenberens, C; Giordano, F A; Sautter, L; López, Guerra; Fleischmann, D F; Niyazi, M; Käsmann, L; Kaul, D; Thieme, A H; Billiet, C; Dobiasch, S; Arnold, C R; Oertel, M; Haussmann, J; Gauer, T; Goy, Y; Suess, C; Ziegler, S; Panje, C M; Baues, C; Trommer-Nestler, M; Skripcak, T; Medenwald, D",Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

We implemented a cross-sectional study and enrolled a sample of CMF surgeons who completed a survey. Objective To measure the impact that COVID-19 has had on CMF surgeons by (1) identifying variations that may exist by geographic region and specialty and (2) measuring access to adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and identify factors associated with limited access to adequate PPE. Methods Primary outcome variable was availability of adequate PPE for health-care workers (HCWs) in the front line and surgeons. Descriptive and analytic statistics were computed. Level of statistical significance was set at P < .05. Binary logistic regression models were created to identify variables associated with PPE status (adequate or inadequate). Results Most of the respondents felt that hospitals did not provide adequate PPE to the HCWs (57.3%) with significant regional differences (P = .04). Most adequate PPE was available to surgeons in North America with the least offered in Africa. Differences in PPE adequacy per region (P < .001) and per country (P < .001) were significant. In Africa and South America, regions reporting previous virus outbreaks, the differences in access to adequate PPE evaporated compared to Europe (P = .18 and P = .15, respectively). Conclusion The impact of COVID-19 among CMF surgeons is global and adversely affects both clinical practice and personal lives of CMF surgeons. Future surveys should capture what the mid- and long-term impact of the COVID-19 crisis will look like.","van der Tas, Justin; Dodson, Thomas; Buchbinder, Daniel; Fusetti, Stefano; Grant, Michael; Leung, Yiu Yan; Roethlisberger, Erich; Aniceto, Gregorio Sánchez; Schramm, Alexander; Bradley Strong, Edward; Wolvius, Eppo",Craniomaxillofacial trauma & reconstruction,64,1

YORS strategies, such as home delivery of extended-release buprenorphine and extended-release naltrexone for OUD, are designed to increase engagement in treatment, but with the COVID-19 pandemic these strategies increase risk of virus exposure and spread to patients and staff entering homes. We present mobile van service delivery as a potential solution to continuing to provide low-barrier care for young adults with OUD while reducing risk associated with COVID-19. Initial feedback from patients and staff is positive and lays the groundwork to test feasibility and acceptability of this intervention rigorously in future work.

Gait data from 46 patients were simultaneously collected from the vision-based system utilizing deep learning algorithms and the GAITRite system. There was a strong correlation in 11 gait parameters between our vision-based gait analysis method and the GAITRite gait analysis system. Our results also demonstrated excellent agreement between the two measurement systems for all parameters except stride time variability after the cerebrospinal fluid tap test. Our data showed that stride time and stride length variability measured by the vision-based gait analysis system were correlated with FAB scores. Vision-based gait analysis utilizing deep learning algorithms can provide comparable data to GAITRite when assessing gait dysfunction in INPH.

Social distancing and self-isolation have become very important to reduce the spread. This called upon the creation of numerous applications that have used proprietary models for symptoms-tracking and contact-tracing around the world to mitigate the spread. In most of the applications data collected is stored in a centralized database without verification and hence, the data is not reliable. In this study, a decentralized application for COVID-19 symptoms tracking using Blockchain is proposed in order to enhance reliable data collection for training Machine Learning (ML) models. The Blockchain integration in this application will help in collecting COVID-19 symptoms data from the patients with trust. In addition to this, the data would be first verified by an entity of the decentralized network (e.g. a COVID-19 testing lab). Then, with the consent of the patient, this data is provided to the centralized system for retraining the ML. In short, the main advantage of this architecture is that the data from the users is collected and checked by a laboratory first and then provided to the ML model. The process helps in identifying the incorrect ML prediction and further train the ML model with reliable data for accurate prediction. Moreover, the trust of the users is earned as the data transfer happens with their consent and, besides, all transactions are recorded on the Blockchain, which is possible with the help of the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Tadepalli, S.

Two sessions every week must be devoted during each year of Speciality training for such personal development, which includes research or to pursue special interests. Special interest sessions are defined as “a clinical or clinically related area of service which cannot be provided within the training post but which is of direct relevance to the prospective career pathway of the trainee”. This experience must be appropriately managed, supervised and assessed.MethodWe conducted a survey of Speciality trainees in the West Midlands region across all psychiatric specialities using an online survey. The survey was open for one month period in January 2021 and reminders were sent intermittently. Following survey closure, quantitative data were analysed using Google Forms and Excel. Qualitative data were collated and reviewed to identify relevant themes.Result47 of the total 82 Speciality trainees in all psychiatric specialities including dual trainees responded. Maximum response rate was from General adult/Dual trainees who form the bulk of Speciality trainees. Most trainees discussed their special interest with their supervisors and included this in learning plans. 79% were able to have a weekly session. Most sessions were devoted to gaining additional clinical experience, medical education, gaining leadership competencies and completion of further post graduate qualifications. The majority of trainees chose special interest sessions in their own trust, however 45% had difficulty getting released from their clinical commitments. Trainees demonstrated evidence in their portfolio by reflection, WPBA and reflective notes. Trainees were positive about their experiences and requested more support to access sessions locally.ConclusionThe Future Doctor report (HEE 2020) recognised that our Future Doctors must have a broad range of generalist skills to meet the population needs, therefore it is essential that doctors in training are supported by trainers and trusts to access special interest sessions to ensure that they achieve a broad range of competencies.

The role of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) associated with PSD in older patients remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the volume and location of white matter microstructure abnormalities among older patients with early-onset PSD. Methods Older (≥55 years) patients with acute cerebral infarction and hospitalized in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital’s stroke unit from October 2019 to September 2020 were recruited. Participants were assessed with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) within three months after the onset of stroke. All patients had MRI scans. The brain images were segmented into four regions via left/right, frontal/dorsal plains. Two WMHs volume detections (visual rating vs. semi-automated WMHs volumetric detection) were employed on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (FLAIR) for each segment. The study then investigated the association between WMHs volume and MADRS score with regression analysis. Results The study included twenty-nine patients with acute stroke. Total WMHs volume and segmented regions were not statistically associated with the MADRS score. However, there was a trend in different WHMs volume of the left anterior segment between depressed and non-depressed groups (t-test 2.058, p = 0.055). Further, demographic and clinical data showed no association with depressive symptoms. Conclusion The volume of WHMs might not contribute to the development of early-onset PSD in older patients. This study showed a potential of a quantitative MRI analysis in clinical practice. Further investigation with a larger group of patients is needed.","Jaroonpipatkul, Chaichana; Onwanna, Jaruwan; Tunvirachaisakul, Chavit; Jittapiromsak, Nutchawan; Rakvongthai, Yothin; Chutinet, Aurauma; Supasitthumrong, Thitiporn",bioRxiv,64,16

To provide a swift response to a novel outbreak, prior knowledge from similar outbreaks is essential. Here, we study the volume of research conducted on previous coronavirus outbreaks, specifically SARS and MERS, relative to other infectious diseases by analyzing over 35 million papers from the last 20 years. Our results demonstrate that previous coronavirus outbreaks have been understudied compared to other viruses. We also show that the research volume of emerging infectious diseases is very high after an outbreak and drops drastically upon the containment of the disease. This can yield inadequate research and limited investment in gaining a full understanding of novel coronavirus management and prevention.

Context Chemotherapy induced neutropenia (CIN) poses serious harm to patients due to the heightened risk of severe infection. Accordingly, chemotherapy dose is assessed at the beginning of each cycle. The therapeutic window of chemotherapy is determined from population studies, with an individual's dose often scaled by their body surface area. This leads to a large number of patients being over- or under- dosed. We previously developed an application [1] which uses weekly neutrophil counts from the first cycle of docetaxel treatment to predict the level of neutropoenia in subsequent cycles for a given dose of docetaxel. However, in the original app the administration of G-CSF, used as a prophylactic treatment for neutropenia, was not considered. G-CSF administration lacks standardisation and the COVID-19 pandemic has created a highly risk averse environment to infections, raising the prospects that a clinician will administer G-CSF. MethodsAiming to predict the level of neutropenia after the first cycle we draw from models in the literature of CIN for G-CSF treated patients [2,3,4]. We adapt the G-CSF induced feedback effect on neutrophil development in these models to account for features specific to docetaxel patients;notably the rebound in neutrophils above baseline seen after nadir [5], and the apparent short maturation time of neutrophils [4]. Using data in the public domain from the comparator arm of a phase III clinical trial for metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer (clinical trial number NCT00617669), we identify 27 patients treated with docetaxel and G-CSF with weekly blood tests in the first and second cycle. We calibrate our model by minimising a Bayesian objective function to establish a model that predicts the neutrophil count in the second docetaxel cycle from the first. We then simulate the effect of different combinations of docetaxel, G-CSF, and the timing of G-CSF administration. Conclusions Current progress includes a model which captures the rebound above baseline in neutrophil count seen in docetaxel patients. We will show that our model captures the effect of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim on neutrophil counts, and can determine how a docetaxel patient may best benefit from G-CSF treatment and/or a change in dose of docetaxel.","Hurry, C.; Villette, C.; Mistry, H.; Millen, J.; Chassagnole, C.",Cancer Research,64,22

The health emergency has created the need to establish follow-up alternatives, giving rise to telemedicine. Objectives: To evaluate the level of attendance to teleconsultation and the faceto-face usual care in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who underwent to a developed innovative telemedicine program after the declaration of quarantine due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: The present cross-sectional descriptive study reports retrospective data collected from patients with RA and SLE from March to June, 2020;. Since the beginning of March 2020 when Covid-19 was declared in Colombia as a health emergency establishing specific standards for outpatient care, our center has made the necessary legal and technical adjustments to develop an innovative telemedicine service to prevent the epidemiological risk. To all contacted patients were offered the option of teleconsultation or face-to-face consultation;a standardized protocol was set with clinimetry measures evaluated in both groups. Continuous variables were described using mean and standard deviation, and categorical variables were described using numbers and percentages. We performed chi-square tests of independence to determine differences between teleconsulting and conventional face-to-face consultation. Results: A total of 5745 RA patients were followed-up, 5292 (92.1%) by teleconsulting and 453 (7.9%) by conventional face-to-face consultation;among the group of SLE patients, a total of 646 were assessed, of which there were 386 (60%) by teleconsultation and 260 (40%) by face-to-face consultation;this highlights an important difference in the level of acceptance of the teleconsultation between patients with RA and SLE, being much lower in patients with SLE (p value< 0.0001). Regarding gender differences, in men, there were 33 (12.7%) SLE and 89 (19.6%) RA face-to-face consultations, while in women there were 227 (87.3%) SLE and 364 (80.4%) RA in a face-to-face consultation. Regarding patients who were attended through telemedicine, 45 (11.7%) SLE and 966 (18.3%) RA were men, while 341 (88.3%) SLE and 4326 (81.7%) RA were women;that means, in the RA cohort, a greater number of men prefer the faceto-face consultation than in the SLE cohort (p value< 0.0185). 10 RA patients were diagnosed with the Covid-19 in teleconsultation;in all cases, close contact with infected relatives was verified as the probable cause. Conclusion: Telemedicine may provide a viable option for the follow-up of patients with rheumatological diseases even beyond the pandemic. But unexpectedly, data showed an important difference in the acceptance of teleconsultation between patients with RA and SLE, being much higher in older and/or male patients with RA compared to patients with SLE;however, further studies are needed to support this conclusion.","Hernández-Zambrano, S.

Using this screening system, we have identified copper-graphene (Cu-Gr) nanocomposite shows strong antiviral activity. Extensive material and biological characterization of the nanocomposite suggested a unique metal oxide embedded graphene sheet architecture that can inactivate the virion particles only within 30 minutes of pre-incubation and subsequently interferes with the entry of these virion particles into the host cell. This ultimately results in reduced viral gene expression, replication and production of progeny virus particles, slowing down the overall pace of progression of infection.

We explored whether harmonic frequency relations, a signature property of many communication sounds, aid hearing in noise for normal hearing listeners. We measured detection thresholds in noise for tones and speech synthesized to have harmonic or inharmonic spectra. Harmonic signals were consistently easier to detect than otherwise identical inharmonic signals. Harmonicity also improved discrimination of sounds in noise. The largest benefits were observed for two-note up-down “pitch” discrimination and melodic contour discrimination, both of which could be performed equally well with harmonic and inharmonic tones in quiet, but which showed large harmonic advantages in noise. The results show that harmonicity facilitates hearing in noise, plausibly by providing a noise-robust pitch cue that aids detection and discrimination. Significance statement Noise is ubiquitous, and being able to hear in noise is critical to real-world behavior. We report that hearing in noise is aided by sensitivity to the harmonic frequency relations that occur in vocal communication signals and music: harmonic sounds are easier to hear in noise than inharmonic sounds. This effect was present in both musicians and non-musicians and for synthetic as well as natural sounds, suggesting a role in everyday hearing.","McPherson, Malinda J.; Grace, River C.; McDermott, Josh H.",bioRxiv,64,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS 90 urologists aged 25 to 60 years (M=37.27, S.D.=9.53), 93% of them were men, participated in the online survey. They answered questions about their attitude to their job as doctors and the impact of COVID-19. They filled out the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21), the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) and answered questions assessing their sense of control. RESULTS The greatest concern among urologists is the risk of getting infected with COVID-19 (for 30% of the doctors). 43% of urologists state that their profession interesting. A positive attitude to work, as well as the Big Five traits (Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability and Agreeableness) are associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety, stress and lack of control. Working with COVID-19 patients reduces stress and increases the sense of control. Age and high levels of Emotional Stability predicted lower levels of anxiety, depression and stress. DISCUSSION Working with COVID-19 patients allows doctors to feel more control over what is happening. A sense of control, in turn, and a positive attitude towards work are associated with a lower levels of depression, anxiety and stresssymptoms. CONCLUSION The results of this study can be used in selection of therapeutic targets for psychotherapy, administered to doctors; in prevention of symptoms of anxiety, stress and depression among doctors; and in professional selection of doctors for working in crisis situations.","Krasavtseva, Yu V; Kiseleva, M G; Kasyan, G R; Pushkar, D Yu",Urologiia,64,30

However, research has shown that the work attitudes of primary care physicians (PCPs) can greatly affect the stability of the overall workforce and the quality and delivery of health care. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between reported work attitudes of PCPs and their personal, work, and educational characteristics. A multi-stage, complex sampling design was employed to select a sample of 434 PCPs practicing in urban and rural primary care settings, and a survey questionnaire was administered by researchers with sponsorship from the Ministry of Health. Four outcome measures describing work attitudes were used, as well as a number of personal-, work-, and practice-related factors. Findings showed that although most PCPs considered their work as important, a substantial number also reported large workloads, job pressure, and turnover intentions. Findings suggest that policymakers should focus on training and educational opportunities for PCPs and consider ways to ease workload pressures and improve salaries. These policy improvements must accompany reform efforts that are already underway before positive changes in reduced disparities and improved health outcomes can be realized in China.","Shi, Leiyu; Hung, Li-Mei; Song, Kuimeng; Rane, Sarika; Tsai, Jenna; Sun, Xiaojie; Li, Hui; Meng, Qingyue","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",64,31

We compared MetaMap's ability to accurately identify the conditions against a physician's manual annotations and evaluated incorrectly indexed features to determine what additional processing is necessary. MetaMap identified the clinical conditions with a recall of 0.72 and a precision of 0.56. Necessary processing beyond MetaMap's indexing includes finding validation, temporal discrimination, anatomic location discrimination, finding-disease discrimination, and contextual inference.

Such case-control designs are intuitively appealing, but they have also been criticized for leading to inflated estimates of accuracy. METHODS We discuss similarities and differences between diagnostic and etiologic case-control studies, as well as the mechanisms that can lead to variation in estimates of diagnostic accuracy in studies with separate sampling schemes (""gates"") for diseased (cases) and nondiseased individuals (controls). RESULTS Diagnostic accuracy studies are cross-sectional and descriptive in nature. Etiologic case-control studies aim to quantify the effect of potential causal exposures on disease occurrence, which inherently involves a time window between exposure and disease occurrence. Researchers and readers should be aware of spectrum effects in diagnostic case-control studies as a result of the restricted sampling of cases and/or controls, which can lead to changes in estimates of diagnostic accuracy. These spectrum effects may be advantageous in the early investigation of a new diagnostic test, but for an overall evaluation of the clinical performance of a test, case-control studies should closely mimic cross-sectional diagnostic studies. CONCLUSIONS As the accuracy of a test is likely to vary across subgroups of patients, researchers and clinicians might carefully consider the potential for spectrum effects in all designs and analyses, particularly in diagnostic accuracy studies with differential sampling schemes for diseased (cases) and nondiseased individuals (controls).","Rutjes, Anne W S; Reitsma, Johannes B; Vandenbroucke, Jan P; Glas, Afina S; Bossuyt, Patrick M M",Clinical chemistry,64,30

The treatments were a mean dust concentration of either 1.2, 2.7, 5.1 or 9.9 mg/m3 (inhalable fraction) and a mean ammonia concentration of either 0.6, 10.0, 18.8 or 37.0 ppm, concentrations representative of commercial conditions. The experiment was carried out over two years and the pigs were used in eight batches, each consisting of five lots of 24 pigs. Each treatment combination was replicated once, and an additional control lot (nominally 0 mg/m3 dust and 0 ppm ammonia) was included in each batch. The dust concentration was the same in the other four lots in each batch in which the four concentrations of ammonia were used; thus, the split-plot design was more sensitive to the effects of ammonia than dust. The groups of pigs were kept separately in five rooms in a purpose-built facility, and the pollutants were injected continuously into the air supply. Ammonia was supplied from a pressurised cylinder, and the endogenous dust in each room was supplemented by an artificial dust manufactured from feed, barley straw and faeces, mixed by weight in the proportions 5:1:4; its ingredients were oven-dried, milled and mixed, and then resuspended in the air supply. The health of the pigs was assessed in terms of general pathology, respiratory tract pathology, and the microbiology of the nasal cavity, trachea and lung. In each batch, postmortem examinations were carried out on 40 pigs after five weeks' exposure to the pollutants and on 30 pigs two weeks later to test for carryover and recovery--a total of 560 pigs. These examinations revealed minimal gross pathology and widespread minor pathological changes of little significance. The pigs' turbinate and lung scores were low and unaffected by exposure to pollutants. All the putative bacterial pathogens, with the exception of toxigenic Pasteurella multocida type D, were isolated from the respiratory tract of the pigs of both ages, but there were no differences between the effects of the different concentrations of pollutants.","Done, S H; Chennells, D J; Gresham, A C J; Williamson, S; Hunt, B; Taylor, L L; Bland, V; Jones, P; Armstrong, D; White, R P; Demmers, T G M; Teer, N; Wathes, C M",The Veterinary record,64,16

Following intracerebral infection with dengue virus, CXCR3-deficient (CXCR3(-/-)) mice showed significantly higher mortality rates than wild-type (WT) mice; moreover, surviving CXCR3(-/-) mice, but not WT mice, often developed severe hind-limb paralysis. The brains of CXCR3(-/-) mice showed higher viral loads than those of WT mice, and quantitative analysis using real-time PCR, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry revealed fewer T cells, CD8(+) T cells in particular, in the brains of CXCR3(-/-) mice. This suggests that recruitment of effector T cells to sites of dengue infection was diminished in CXCR3(-/-) mice, which impaired elimination of the virus from the brain and thus increased the likelihood of paralysis and/or death. These results indicate that CXCR3 plays a protective rather than an immunopathological role in dengue virus infection. In studies to identify critical CXCR3 ligands, CXCL10/IFN-inducible protein 10-deficient (CXCL10/IP-10(-/-)) mice infected with dengue virus showed a higher mortality rate than that of the CXCR3(-/-) mice. Although CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL9/monokine induced by IFN-gamma, and CXCL11/IFN-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant share a single receptor and all three of these chemokines are induced by dengue virus infection, the latter two could not compensate for the absence of CXCL10/IP-10 in this in vivo model. Our results suggest that both CXCR3 and CXCL10/IP-10 contribute to resistance against primary dengue virus infection and that chemokines that are indistinguishable in in vitro assays differ in their activities in vivo.","Hsieh, Ming-Fang; Lai, Szu-Liang; Chen, Jia-Perng; Sung, Jui-Ming; Lin, Yi-Ling; Wu-Hsieh, Betty A; Gerard, Craig; Luster, Andrew; Liao, Fang",Journal of immunology,64,17

Previous studies conducted to analyse enteroviral respiratory tract infections focused on outbreaks. Data in the Southeast Asian region is still rather limited to date. OBJECTIVES We conducted a prospective analysis to understand the epidemiological characteristics of enteroviral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) among paediatric patients admitted to Hospital Ampang, a tertiary hospital in Malaysia. METHODOLOGY Nasopharyngeal aspirates for common respiratory viruses and throat swabs for enteroviruses were obtained for rtPCR analyses. All positive enteroviral results were then cultured for species identification. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Of the total 211 recruited patients, enteroviral LRTIs made up 8%. The clinical features of enteroviral infections are mostly clinically indistinguishable from that of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. However, RSV appears to be more lymphocytosis causing than enteroviruses (EV). We found a higher asthma incidence within the enteroviral group compared to RSV group. Enteroviral infections continue to play an important role in LRTIs in children beyond infancy and up to school age. Among the enteroviral strains, EV71 contributes a major role in enteroviral LRTIs in our center. Routine testing for enterovirus would certainly help identify a significant proportion of unexplained viral LRTIs among paediatric patients. However, further cost analyses studies would be helpful to determine if incorporating testing for enteroviruses into routine respiratory viruses panel tests is economically feasible.","Tan, J W Y; Nuryasmin, R; Apandi, Y; Nethiya, V; Hussin, H; Zuraidah, A L",The Medical journal of Malaysia,64,17

Proteogenomics is an alternative approach that can identify novel proteins encoded by regions previously considered as non-coding. This study aimed to confidently identify and confirm the existence of previously unknown protein-coding sequences in the Eucalyptus grandis genome. To this end, we used a modified spectral correlation strategy and a dedicated de novo peptide sequencing pipeline. Upon the strategy used here, we confidently identified 41 novel peptide forms and six peptides containing at least one single amino acid substitution. The most representative genomic class of novel peptides was identified as originating from alternative reading frames. In contrast, no clear single amino acid substitution pattern was identified. Validation of the identifications was carried out using a parallel reaction monitoring approach that provided further mass spectrometry support for the existence of the novel peptide sequences.

Elevation and air quality are believed to be significant factors in the development of the pandemic, but the influence of additional environmental factors remains unclear. METHODS: We explored the relationship between the cumulative number of infections and mortality cases with climate (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, water vapor pressure, wind), environmental data (elevation, normalized difference vegetation index or NDVI, particulate matter at 2.5 µm or PM2.5 and NO2 concentration), and population density in Peru. We use confirmed cases of infection from 1,287 districts and mortality in 479 districts, we used Spearman's correlations to assess the bivariate correlation between environmental and climatic factors with cumulative infection cases, cumulative mortality and case-fatality rate. We explored district cases within the ecozones of coast, sierra, high montane forest and lowland rainforest. RESULTS: Multiple linear regression models indicate elevation, mean solar radiation, air quality, population density and green vegetation cover, as a socioeconomic proxy, are influential factors in the distribution of infection and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in Peru. Case-fatality rate was weakly associated with elevation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results also strongly suggest that exposure to poor air quality is a significant factor in the mortality of individuals below the age of 30. We conclude that environmental and climatic factors do play a significant role in the transmission and case fatality rates in Peru, however further study is required to see if these relationships are maintained over time.","Samillan, Victor J; Flores-León, Diana; Rojas, Eduardo; Zutta, Brian R",J. basic clin. physiol. pharmacol,64,17

A total of 198 male dairy calves housed at a grain-fed veal facility were examined from June 11, 2018, to October 9, 2018. Calves were fed milk replacer twice daily and housed individually until weaning at 56 d. Once weaned, calves were moved into groups of 5 until they were moved to a finishing facility at 77 d. At the grain-fed veal facility, calves were scored for fecal consistency for the first 28 d and had fecal samples taken on arrival and at 7 and 14 d. Fecal samples were frozen and submitted to a commercial laboratory, where they were tested for BCoV, C.parvum, and 2 groups of BRoV: group A (BRoV A) and group B (BRoV B). Calves were weighed on arrival and at 14, 49, 56, and 77 d using a digital body scale. Treatments for disease and mortalities that occurred over the 77 d were also recorded. Statistical models, including Cox proportional hazards and repeated measures models, were built to determine the effect of infection with 1 of the pathogens. Over the 3 sampling points, 151 (85.8%), 178 (94.2%), 3 (1.5%), and 97 (57.4%) calves tested positive at least once for BCoV, BRoV A, BRoV B, and C.parvum, respectively. The source of the calves and the level of serum total protein measured on arrival were associated with testing positive for a pathogen. Calves that tested positive for C.parvum had an increased proportion of days with diarrhea and severe diarrhea; calves that tested positive for BCoV and BRoV A had an increased proportion of days with severe diarrhea. In addition, calves that tested positive for C.parvum had a higher hazard of being treated for respiratory disease. With respect to body weight, calves that had diarrhea or severe diarrhea had lower body weight at 49, 56, and 77 d. Specifically, calves that had an increased proportion of days with diarrhea showed a reduction in weight gain of up to 15 kg compared to calves without diarrhea. Calves that tested positive for C.parvum had a lower body weight at 49, 56, and 77 d; calves that tested positive for BCoV had a lower body weight at 56 and 77 d. This study demonstrates that the prevalence of BCoV, BRoV A, and C.parvum infection is high in this population of calves and has significant effects on the occurrence of diarrhea and body weight gain. Future studies should evaluate approaches for minimizing the effect of infection with these pathogens to improve the welfare, health, and productivity of dairy calves.","Renaud, D L; Rot, C; Marshall, J; Steele, M A",J Dairy Sci,64,1

Evidence exists that supports the idea that the KKS is not only critical to blood pressure but may also oppose target organ damage. Kinins are generated from kininogens by tissue and plasma kallikreins. The putative role of kinins in the pathogenesis of hypertension is discussed based on human mutation cases on the KKS or rats with spontaneous mutation in the kininogen gene sequence and mouse models in which the gene expressing only one of the components of the KKS has been deleted or over-expressed. Some of the effects of kinins are mediated via activation of the B2 and/or B1 receptor and downstream signaling such as eicosanoids, nitric oxide (NO), endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) and/or tissue plasminogen activator (T-PA). The role of kinins in blood pressure regulation at normal or under hypertension conditions remains debatable due to contradictory reports from various laboratories. Nevertheless, published reports are consistent on the protective and mediating roles of kinins against ischemia and cardiac preconditioning; reports also demonstrate the roles of kinins in the cardiovascular protective effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs).","Hamid, Suhail; Rhaleb, Imane A; Kassem, Kamal M; Rhaleb, Nour-Eddine",,64,26

Africa has been described as one of the most vulnerable region with the COVID-19 infection during the initial phase of the outbreak, due to the fact that Africa is a great commercial partner of China and some other EU and American countries. Which result in large volume of travels by traders to the region more frequently and causing African countries face even bigger health threat during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the fact that the control and management of COVID-19 pandemic rely heavily on a country's health care system, and on average Africa has poor health care system which make it more vulnerable indicating a need for timely intervention to curtail the spread. In this paper, we estimate the exponential growth rate and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 in Africa to show the potential of the virus to spread, and reveal the importance of sustaining stringent health measures to control the disease in Africa. METHODS: We analyzed the initial phase of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Africa between 1 March and 13 April 2020, by using the simple exponential growth model. We examined the publicly available materials published by the WHO situation report to show the potential of COVID-19 to spread without sustaining strict health measures. The Poisson likelihood framework is adopted for data fitting and parameter estimation. We modelled the distribution of COVID-19 generation interval (GI) as Gamma distributions with a mean of 4.7 days and standard deviation of 2.9 days estimated from previous work, and compute the basic reproduction number. RESULTS: We estimated the exponential growth rate as 0.22 per day (95% CI: 0.20-0.24), and the basic reproduction number, R0, as 2.37 (95% CI: 2.22-2.51) based on the assumption that the exponential growth starting from 1 March 2020. With an R0 at 2.37, we quantified the instantaneous transmissibility of the outbreak by the time-varying effective reproductive number to show the potential of COVID-19 to spread across African region. CONCLUSIONS: The initial growth of COVID-19 cases in Africa was rapid and showed large variations across countries. Our estimates should be useful in preparedness planning against further spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Africa.","Musa, Salihu S; Zhao, Shi; Wang, Maggie H; Habib, Abdurrazaq G; Mustapha, Umar T; He, Daihai",Infect Dis Poverty,64,6

Based on the review of the literature and a variety of examples that focus on the role of information quality in policy design, and drawing on two phenomena from the field of epidemiology (namely, over-adjustment and unnecessary adjustment), the article enhances the definitional clarity of the terms under investigation and allows us to address the difficulty in reconciling technical problem solving with politics. The article proposes new definitional statements of proportionate and disproportionate policy designs that vary according to the extent to which the main design properties are adjusted to low-quality information. It also explores distinct variations in a few policy characteristics resulting from over- and under-design. The policy characteristics examined here include economic efficiency, policy effectiveness, policy robustness; the space for making significant changes at a later stage when high-quality information becomes available; the potential consequences in terms of policy over- and under-reaction; and the political ramifications of these suboptimal designs for elected executives. With regard to the interaction between technical and political logics, the article posits that deliberate policy over- and under-design can be viewed as solutions to serious political problems faced by elected executives, especially in politically sensitive times. Therefore, it facilitates a more realistic understanding of the conditions under which a policy is under- or over-designed to respond to some objectives but entirely proportionate with regard to others.","Maor, Moshe",Policy Sci,64,1

The adaptive cooling approach is demonstrated to be more computationally efficient than classical simulated annealing, when applied to Lennard-Jones clusters. This increase in efficiency is approximately a factor of two for clusters with 25--40 atoms, and improves with the size of the system.","Karabin, Mariia; Stuart, Steven J.",,64,22

Despite its importance as a drug target, the molecular activation mechanism of CCR5, i.e., how chemokine agonists transduce the activation signal through the receptor, is yet unknown. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of wild-type CCR5 in an active conformation bound to the chemokine super-agonist [6P4]CCL5 and the heterotrimeric Gi protein. The structure provides the rationale for the sequence-activity relation of agonist and antagonist chemokines. The N terminus of agonist chemokines pushes onto specific structural motifs at the bottom of the orthosteric pocket that activate the canonical GPCR microswitch network. This activation mechanism differs substantially from other CC chemokine receptors that bind chemokines with shorter N termini in a shallow binding mode involving unique sequence signatures and a specialized activation mechanism.","Isaikina, Polina; Tsai, Ching-Ju; Dietz, Nikolaus; Pamula, Filip; Grahl, Anne; Goldie, Kenneth N; Guixà-González, Ramon; Branco, Camila; Paolini-Bertrand, Marianne; Calo, Nicolas; Cerini, Fabrice; Schertler, Gebhard F X; Hartley, Oliver; Stahlberg, Henning; Maier, Timm; Deupi, Xavier; Grzesiek, Stephan",Sci.

For both B.1.1.7 and B.1351 variants, named as variants of concern (VOC), increased transmissibility was reported, whereas B.1.351 was more resistant to multiple monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), as well as convalescent and vaccination sera. To test this hypothesis, we examined the proportion of VOC over time across different geographic areas where the two VOC, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, co-circulate. Our comparative analysis was based on the number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences on GISAID database. We report that B.1.1.7 dominates over B.1.351 in geographic areas where both variants co-circulate and the B.1.1.7 was the first variant introduced in the population. The only areas where B.1.351 was detected at higher proportion were South Africa and Mayotte in Africa, where this strain was associated with increased community transmission before the detection of B.1.1.7. The dominance of B.1.1.7 over B.1.351 could be important since B.1.351 was more resistant to certain mAbs, as well as heterologous convalescent and vaccination sera, thus suggesting that it may be transmitted more effectively in people with pre-existing immunity to other VOC. This scenario would lessen the effectiveness of vaccine and urge the need to update them with new strains.","Kostaki, Evangelia Georgia Tseti Ioulia Tsiodras Sotirios Pavlakis George N.; Sfikakis, Petros P.; Paraskevis, Dimitrios",Life,64,20

The influence of pyrolysis temperature (400-600 °C) and catalyst (zeolite, spent FCC, and MgO catalyst) on the pyrolysis liquid composition and yield was studied. The studied petroleum-based plastics had similar decomposition temperature ranges but produced their highest pyrolysis yields at different temperatures. Pyrolysis liquids from thermal degradation of HDPE and LDPE consisted high yield of waxes but those of PP and PLA consisted of both waxes and liquid oil. Catalysts affected not only the pyrolysis yield, but also the proportions of liquid oil and wax in pyrolysis liquids. Alkenes, alkanes, and aromatics were the main compounds in the pyrolysis liquids. Spent FCC catalyst reduced the production of waxes and increased the production of gasoline-range hydrocarbons and aromatics. MgO catalyst led to high coke formation from polyolefins and PLA. Lactic acid, lactide and propanoic acid were examples of valuable chemicals recovered from the pyrolysis of PLA. Lactide was the main product (up to 79%) of catalytic pyrolysis with zeolite at 400 °C. Spent FCC catalyst produced mostly propanoic acid at 400 °C but at 600 °C, L-lactic acid became the most abundant compound.","Saeaung, Koranit; Phusunti, Neeranuch; Phetwarotai, Worasak; Assabumrungrat, Suttichai; Cheirsilp, Benjamas",Waste Manag,64,20

The scarcity situation eliminates excesses of medicine, and then allocates respirators by a single scale, combining an evidence-based scoring system with risk-proportionate lottery.

Three clinical risk factors were found, included age, malignancy and highest temperature that influence OS. Both two radiomics signatures could effectively stratify the risk of OS in COVID-19 severe patients. The predictive performance of the combination model with two radiomics signatures was better than that only one radiomics signature was used, and became better when three clinical risk factors were interpolated. Calibration curves showed good agreement in both 15 d survival and 30 d survival between the estimation with the constructed nomogram and actual observation. Both two constructed radiomics signatures can act as the potential biomarkers for risk stratification of OS in COVID-19 severe patients. The radiomics+clinical nomogram generated might serve as a potential tool to guide personalized treatment and care for these patients.","Xiao, Feng; Sun, Rongqing; Sun, Wenbo; Xu, Dan; Lan, Lan; Li, Huan; Liu, Huan; Xu, Haibo",Phys. med. biol,64,1

On 12 March 2020, a lockdown order was issued in Italy in attempt to contain the health crisis. The study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on diet, physical activity, sleep quality, and distress in an Italian cohort. An online anonymous interview, which included validated questionnaires was created to compare lifestyle habits pre- and during the lockdown. Data analysis from 604 subjects with a mean age of 29.8 years was carried out using multivariate analysis. Compared to pre-COVID-19 times, 67% of people changed their eating habits and increased consumption of foods containing added sugars. Women and men with low adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) were more likely to be physically inactive (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.01, respectively). Results from logistic regression showed a three times higher risk of being inactive if adherence to the MedDiet was low (p < 0.0001), especially in men between 26 and 35 years. Lower levels of distress were reported in males who were physically active (89%) (p < 0.001).

While several studies have characterized the effectiveness of vaccines against severe forms of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection, estimates of their impact on transmissibility remain limited. Here, we evaluated the role of vaccination and isolation on SARS-CoV-2 transmission within Israeli households. MethodsFrom December 2020 to April 2021, confirmed cases were identified among healthcare workers of the Sheba Medical Centre and their family members. Households were recruited and followed up with repeated PCR for a minimum of ten days after case confirmation. Symptoms and vaccination information were collected at the end of follow-up. We developed a data augmentation Bayesian framework to ascertain how age, isolation and BNT162b2 vaccination with more than 7 days after the 2nd dose impacted household transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Findings210 households with 215 index cases were enrolled. 269 out of 687 (39%) household contacts developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those, 170 (63%) developed symptoms. Children below 12 years old were less susceptible than adults/teenagers (Relative Risk RR=0{middle dot}50, 95% Credible Interval CI 0{middle dot}32-0{middle dot}79). Vaccination reduced the risk of infection among adults/teenagers (RR=0{middle dot}19, 95% CI 0{middle dot}07-0{middle dot}40). Isolation reduced the risk of infection of unvaccinated adult/teenager (RR=0{middle dot}11, 95% CI 0{middle dot}05-0{middle dot}19) and child contacts (RR=0{middle dot}16, 95% CI 0{middle dot}07-0{middle dot}31) compared to unvaccinated adults/teenagers that did not isolate. Infectivity was significantly reduced in vaccinated cases (RR=0{middle dot}22, 95% CI 0{middle dot}06-0{middle dot}70). InterpretationWithin households, vaccination reduces both the risk of infection and of transmission if infected. When contacts were not vaccinated, isolation also led to important reductions in the risk of transmission. Vaccinated contacts might reduce their risk of infection if they isolate, although this requires confirmation with additional data. FundingSheba Medical Center. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe efficacy of vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmissions in households remains understudied. On June 28, 2021, we searched PubMed and medRxiv for articles published between December 1, 2020, and June 28, 2021, using the following combination of search terms: (""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"") AND (""household*"" OR ""famil*"") AND ""transmission"" AND ""vaccination"". Our search yielded two articles that investigated the effect of vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in households. They showed a lower risk of infection in households with vaccinees. Vaccine efficacy on the risk of infection was estimated to 80% after the 2nd dose, and vaccine efficacy on the risk of transmission if infected was estimated to 49% 21 days after the 1st dose. However, these estimates are derived from surveillance data with no active follow-up of the households. In addition, the impact of isolation precautions has not been assessed. Added value of this studyBased on the active follow-up of households of health care workers from the Sheba Medical Center in Israel, we estimated the effect of vaccination on household transmission. To our knowledge, our study is the first to conjointly investigate the effect of vaccination, age, and isolation precautions on the risk of infection and the risk of transmission in households while accounting for tertiary infections in the household, infections within the community, the reduced infectivity of asymptomatic cases, misidentification of index cases, and household size. Our study confirmed the high efficacy of BNT-162b2 vaccination to reduce infection risk and transmission risk. It also suggests that isolation might remain beneficial to vaccinated contacts. Implications of all the available evidenceVaccination reduces susceptibility to infection and case infectivity in households. Isolation precautions also mitigate the risk of infection and should be implemented whenever a household member is infected. They might remain beneficial to vaccinated contacts.","Layan, Maylis; Gilboa, Mayan; Gonen, Tal; Goldenfeld, Miki; Meltzer, Lilac; Andronico, Alessio; Hoze, Nathanael; Cauchemez, Simon; Regev-Yochay, Gili",,64,16

Concerns are raised because previous studies have demonstrated co-infection may contribute to the recombination of RNA viruses and cause severe clinic symptoms. In this study, we have estimated the compositional lineage(s), tendentiousness, and frequency of co-infection events in population from a large-scale genomic analysis for SARS-CoV-2 patients. SARS-CoV-2 lineage(s) infected in each sample have been recognized from the assignment of within-host site variations into lineage-defined feature variations by introducing a hypergeometric distribution method. Of all the 29,993 samples, 53 (~0.18%) co-infection events have been identified. Apart from 52 co-infections with two SARS-CoV-2 lineages, one sample with co-infections of three SARS-CoV-2 lineages was firstly identified. As expected, the co-infection events mainly happened in the regions where have co-existed more than two dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineages. However, co-infection of two sub-lineages in Delta lineage were detected as well. Our results provide a useful reference framework for the high throughput detecting of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection events in the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Although low in average rate, the co-infection events showed an increasing tendency with the increased diversity of SARS-CoV-2. And considering the large base of SARS-CoV-2 infections globally, co-infected patients would be a nonnegligible population. Thus, more clinical research is urgently needed on these patients.","Zhou, Hang-Yu; Cheng, Ye-Xiao; Xu, Lin; Li, Jia-Ying; Tao, Chen-Yue; Ji, Cheng-Yang; Han, Na; Yang, Rong; Li, Yaling; Wu, Aiping",,64,10

METHODS: Retrospective longitudinal observational study of ER accesses for psychiatric evaluation was performed, comparing two periods (9 March-3 May 2020 vs. 9 March-3 May 2019). Data (number of admissions, key baseline demographic and clinical variables) were extracted from the ER databases of referral centres in a well-defined geographic area of North-Eastern Italy (Cesena, Ravenna, Forlì, and Rimini). RESULTS: A 15% reduction of psychiatric referrals was observed, together with a 17% reduction in the total number of patients referring to the ER. This reduction was most evident in the first month of the lockdown period (almost 25% reduction of both referrals and patients). Female gender (OR: 1.52: 95%, CI: 1.12-2.06) and being a local resident (OR: 1.54: 95%CI: 1.02-2.34) were factors associated with the decrease.

Notably, the majority of UAMs enter Europe irregularly through two main gateways to the European continent: via Italy, using the Central Mediterranean Sea route;or through Greece, transiting through the Eastern Mediterranean route from Turkey, mostly via sea. Profiles of UAMs travelling via the two different routes are significantly diverse, reflecting Italy’s and Greece’s geographical proximity to North Africa and the Middle East, respectively. Although Italy has witnessed a decline since 2018 (Todaro and Romano 2019), the two countries have faced a significant increase in UAMs, and this has required a considerable reorganisation of the reception systems and, more generally, of their welfare systems. However, difficulties in securing adequate reception for UAMs seeking protection have persisted in both countries. Through an analysis of the impact of the pandemic on the Italian and Greek reception systems and social interventions with UAMs, we utilised a multiple embedded case study approach within a comparative analysis, to identify key changes in the main services which should be guaranteed to minors—namely, hosting/housing, guardianship, foster care, family/relatives reunification, school integration, language, job training for care leaving, and preparation for leaving care after 18 years (Di Rosa 2017;Buchanan and Kallinikaki 2018;Barn et al. 2020). Against a background of critical reviews of the main issues related to policies and reported social work practice in a context of COVID-19 precarity, set within a wider EU framework, this paper contributes to the literature with an analysis of the current situation and the tightening of the conditions of reception, inclusion and integration that await UAMs in these gateway countries today. We conclude that with the suspension of key services and amenities, and with a practical halt to the due process of immigration and asylum, social workers are facing a difficult challenge to prevent the deterioration of UAMs’ mental health and well-being. © 2021 by the authors.

On 30th January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a global public health emergency of very high-risk category. The host species of alpha- and beta-CoVs is mammal and these viruses generally infect epithelial cells in the respiratory and/or enteric tracts, causing respiratory disease and/or gastroenteritis with short incubation period, ranging from a few days to a week [4]. Similar to other HCoVs, the SARS-CoV-2 viral envelop is made up of a lipid bilayer in which the structural proteins, viz., spike (S), envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins, are anchored and inside the virus' envelop, there is the nucleocapsid (N) protein which is bound to the RNA genome (Figure 1) [6,7].The genome size of this virus is around 30 kb encoding different non-structural proteins at the 5'-end, four structural proteins (S, E, M and N) and several lineage-specific proteins at the 3'-end [6].","Kumar, Neeraj Singh Paras Dewan Ravindra Kumar Chuzho Neihenuo Chauhan Shreya Khayyam Khalid Umer",Health Science Journal,64,1

This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease. Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study. A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-55), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3% men). The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area. Forty-three (31.9%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]). Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]). Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients. All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]). In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8%]). It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines. Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C-reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase. This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID-19 patients. Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia. Further studies are required to explore the role of Kaletra and TCM in the treatment of COVID-19.","Wan, Suxin; Xiang, Yi; Fang, Wei; Zheng, Yu; Li, Boqun; Hu, Yanjun; Lang, Chunhui; Huang, Daoqiu; Sun, Qiuyan; Xiong, Yan; Huang, Xia; Lv, Jinglong; Luo, Yaling; Shen, Li; Yang, Haoran; Huang, Gu; Yang, Ruishan",J Med Virol,64,22

The aim of the present study was to determine detraining effects on musculoskeletal outcomes after a 3-month detraining period in early post-menopausal, osteopenic women. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we terminated the 18-month randomized controlled ACTLIFE exercise intervention immediately after the 13-month follow-up assessment. This put an abrupt stop to the high-intensity aerobic and resistance group exercise sessions undertaken three times per week by the exercise group (EG: n = 27) and the gentle exercise program performed once per week for the attention control group (CG: n = 27); but both groups were permitted to conduct individual outdoor activity for the 3-month lock-down period. Study endpoints were lean body mass (LBM), bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine (LS), maximum hip-/leg extension strength and power. Detraining-induced reductions of LBM, hip/leg strength and power (but not BMD-LS) were significantly greater (p < 0.001 to p = 0.044) compared with the CG. Significant exercise effects, i.e. differences between EG and CG, present after 13 months of exercise, were lost after 3 months of detraining for LBM (p = 0.157) and BMD-LS (p = 0.065), but not for strength (p < 0.001) and power (p < 0.001). Of note, self-reported individual outdoor activities and exercise increased by about 40% in both groups during the lock-down period. Three months' absence from a supervised group exercise protocol resulted in considerable detraining effects for musculoskeletal parameters. Thus, exercise programs for adults should be continuous rather than intermittent.Trial registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04420806, 06.05.2020.","Kemmler, Wolfgang; Hettchen, Michael; Kohl, Matthias; Murphy, Marie; Bragonzoni, Laura; Julin, Mikko; Risto, Tapani; von Stengel, Simon",Calcif. tissue int,64,19

Although the underlying mechanism of COVID-19 coagulopathy remains unknown, it has been suggested to be a form of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to analyze the coagulation parameters of patients with COVID-19, determine whether coagulation factors consumption occurs and identify potential prognostic biomarkers of the disease. PATIENTS/METHODS: Blood samples from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were collected. We performed basic coagulation tests and quantification of coagulation factors and physiological inhibitor proteins. Laboratory data were compared with clinical data and outcomes. RESULTS: The study involved 206 patients (63.6% male). D-dimer was particularly elevated (median 450 ng/mL; IQR 222.5-957.3). Free protein S levels were below the normal range (median 56.6%; IQR: 43.6-68.9), and factor VIII showed an increasing trend (median 173.4%; IQR: 144.1-214.9). However, all coagulation factors were within normal limits. We found no correlation between abnormal coagulation parameters and thrombosis, except for higher D-dimer (HR 1.99; 95% CI 1.3-3.1; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with coagulopathy that correlates with poor prognosis.

Nasopharyngeal swabs from 453 adult SARS-CoV-2-infected patients from the Department of Infectious Diseases, Besançon, France, were collected at the time of admission or consultation for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Clinical information and concentrations of biological parameters (C-reactive protein [CRP], fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], prealbumin) were noticed. Mean respiratory VL homogeneously decreased from 7.2 log10 copies/ml (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.6-7.8) on the first day of symptoms until 4.6 log10 copies/ml (95% CI: 3.8-5.4) at day 10 (slope = -0.24; R2 = .95). VL were poorly correlated with COVID-19 symptoms and outcome, excepted for dyspnea and anosmia, which were significantly associated with lower VL (p < .05). CRP, fibrinogen, and LDH concentrations significantly increased over the first 10 days (median CRP concentrations from 36.8 mg/L at days 0-1 to 99.5 mg/L at days 8-10; p < .01), whereas prealbumin concentrations tended to decrease. Since SARS-CoV-2 respiratory VL regularly decrease in the acute phase of infection, determining the level of VL may help predicting the onset of virus shedding in a specific patient.

In the current study, we propose a framework that incorporates these three factors into a vicious circle that leads to deconditioning, a condition frequently experienced by this vulnerable population. Viewing aspiration pneumonia, dysphagia, and sarcopenia, along with their interrelationships through the lens of this vicious circle, illuminates the critical role that oral health plays in deconditioning. Moreover, this framework highlights oral care as a key nursing intervention for reducing deconditioning in hospitalized older adults. Supporting this view, several studies have shown that oral care can improve health outcomes for hospitalized older adults. However, despite oral care being an essential nursing intervention that restores oral function and promotes patient wellness, it is one of the most neglected nursing interventions. Missed oral care occurs due to staff's limited awareness of its significance for care-dependent older adults in hospital settings. We hope that this vicious circle paradigm helps raise awareness of the significance of oral care to prevent deconditioning in hospitalized older adults.

Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, a set of risk assessment criteria is proposed to classify risks as ‘low’, ‘moderate’, or ‘high’. We recommend the following: (1) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-h work shift duration; (2) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patients, e.g., less than 40 min for the whole day; (3) increase the clean and safe space for social distancing, e.g., maximum of 10% crowd density, and if possible, implement compartmentalization of patients; and/or (4) provide effective protective gears and facilities, e.g., 95% effective, that the frontline health care workers can use during their shift. Moreover, the formulated model can be used for other similar scenarios, such as identifying infection risk in public transportation, school classroom settings, offices, and mass gatherings.","Dy, Louie Florendo; Rabajante, Jomar Fajardo",Netw.

Given the sudden infection from and extensive dispersion of COVID-19 and the absence of specific drugs, those infected are in danger if they are not treated in time. Consequently, COVID-19 has become an important factor influencing adolescents' mental health. The purpose of this study is to explore the intervention effect of the integration model on the negative emotions of adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Adolescents were randomly selected from five middle schools in Zhejiang Province of China from May 2020 to July 2020. First, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Scale, and Psychological Well-Being Scale were used for measurement. Then, 72 patients with moderate and severe anxiety symptoms were chosen as the research objects, and the intervention and comparison time was determined to be eight weeks. The subjects were randomly divided into the experiment group (35 members) and the control group (34 members). The integration model was employed on the experiment group. RESULTS: Grade, physical condition, and sleep time are important factors influencing the anxiety level of adolescents during the COVID-19 period, and the anxiety risk of adolescents is higher during their third year of junior high school. After the intervention, the SAS score of the experiment group is lower than that of the control group, and the decrease in the SAS score is higher in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01). Moreover, the positive emotion score of the experiment group is higher than that of the control group, and the negative emotion score of the former is lower than that of the latter. The variances in the positive and negative emotion scores are higher in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01). The variance in the overall well-being index is also greater in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The intervention using the integrated model can significantly reduce negative emotions such as anxiety, increase positive emotions, and improve the overall well-being of adolescents during the epidemic period.","Chen, Jun; Sang, Guoqiang; Zhang, Yu; Jiang, Aifeng",Psychiatr Danub,64,1

These data, most of which are recorded within 24 hours of the visit, might be an early indicator of changing patterns in disparities. Using ED visit data from 13 states obtained from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP), CDC assessed the number of ED visits with a COVID-19 discharge diagnosis code per 100,000 population during October-December 2020 by age and race/ethnicity. Among 5,794,050 total ED visits during this period, 282,220 (4.9%) were for COVID-19. Racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 ED visit rates were observed across age groups.

One example of the latter kind of measures is social distancing, which can be either policy-driven or can arise endogenously in the population as a consequence of the fear of infection. However, if NPIs are lifted before the population reaches herd immunity, further re-introductions of the pathogen would lead to secondary infections. Here we study the effects of different social distancing schemes on the large scale spreading of diseases. Specifically, we generalize metapopulation models to include social distancing mechanisms at the subpopulation level and model short- and long-term strategies that are fed with local or global information about the epidemics. We show that different model ingredients might lead to very diverse outcomes in different subpopulations. Our results suggest that there is not a unique answer to the question of whether contention measures are more efficient if implemented and managed locally or globally and that model outcomes depends on how the full complexity of human interactions is taken into account.","Ventura, Paulo Cesar; Aleta, Alberto; Rodrigues, Francisco Aparecido; Moreno, Yamir",,64,16

The possible sources of sulfate in the system are contaminants in the DTT or the oxidation product of the DTT sulfhydryl. The amount of gypsum produced implies that contaminants do not account for the total sulfate present in the system, suggesting that the DTT could be oxidized.

As social distancing and stay-at-home orders came into effect, many turned to social media for socializing. This increase in social media usage has made it a prime vehicle for the spreading of misinformation. This paper presents a mechanism to detect COVID-19 health-related misinformation in social media following an interdisciplinary approach. Leveraging social psychology as a foundation and existing misinformation frameworks, we defined misinformation themes and associated keywords incorporated into the misinformation detection mechanism using applied machine learning techniques. Next, using the Twitter dataset, we explored the performance of the proposed methodology using multiple state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers. Our method shows promising results with at most 78% accuracy in classifying health-related misinformation versus true information using uni-gram-based NLP feature generations from tweets and the Decision Tree classifier. We also provide suggestions on alternatives for countering misinformation and ethical consideration for the study.","Pritom, Mir Mehedi A.; Rodriguez, Rosana Montanez; Khan, Asad Ali; Nugroho, Sebastian A.; Alrashydah, Esra'a; Ruiz, Beatrice N.; Rios, Anthony",,64,1

Although it may yield immediate savings by diverting health care from higher-cost settings, these savings could be countered if direct-to-consumer telemedicine increases follow-up care and, therefore, episode costs. Comparing downstream care utilization data from a large, commercial payer for the period 2016-19, we found that patients with initial visits for acute respiratory infection were more likely to obtain follow-up care within seven days after direct-to-consumer telemedicine visits (10.3 percent) than after in-person visits (5.9 percent). In both settings approximately 90 percent of patients did not obtain additional care. The telemedicine cohort had fewer (0.5 percent versus 0.6 percent) emergency department visits-a small but statistically significant difference-but more subsequent office, urgent care, and telemedicine visits. Our findings suggest that potential savings from shifting initial care to a direct-to-consumer telemedicine setting should be balanced against the potential for higher spending on downstream care.","Li, Kathleen Yinran; Zhu, Ziwei; Ng, Sophia; Ellimoottil, Chad",Health Aff (Millwood),64,16

The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear. Objective: To determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter. Results: Of 5â¯424â¯688 inpatient encounters among 3â¯372â¯839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2â¯823â¯748 [52.1%] boys; 3â¯171â¯224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213â¯571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23â¯798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43â¯550 [42â¯110-43â¯946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4â¯327â¯580â¯511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5â¯983â¯142â¯102 [$5â¯762â¯690â¯022-$6â¯324â¯978â¯456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pelletier, Jonathan H; Rakkar, Jaskaran; Au, Alicia K; Fuhrman, Dana; Clark, Robert S B; Horvat, Christopher M",JAMA Netw Open,64,16

Previous studies have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells via binding to angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). Methods: To explore the expression of ACE2 and the potential risk of infection in testis, we performed a bioinformatic analysis based on public databases, and conducted a pilot study using a mouse model. We also collected clinical follow-up date on male patients who had recovered from COVID-19 for 6 months. Results: The results showed that the RNA expression of ACE2 was higher in testis compared with other organs. Single-cell analysis and immunocytochemistry further indicated that Leydig cells were at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Green fluorescence was only detected in the Leydig cells after intratesticular injection of pseudovirus SARS-CoV-2 in the mouse model. In the clinical follow-up, serum total testosterone level was statistically lower in patients who had recovered from COVID-19 compared with healthy men (P=0.010). Conclusions: The findings of the present study indicate the potential vulnerability of Leydig cells. It is important to monitor the reproductive system and its complications in male COVID-19 patients. Further studies are still needed on SARS-CoV-2-associated reproductive complications.","Zhang, J.; Wu, Y.; Li, S.; Wang, X.; Wang, R.",Annals of Translational Medicine,64,16

The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major target for the COVID-19 vaccine. To quickly respond to the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a nucleic acid-based vaccine is a novel option, beyond the traditional inactivated virus vaccine or recombinant protein vaccine. Here, we report a DNA vaccine containing the spike gene for delivery via electroporation. The spike genes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were codon optimized for mammalian cell expression and then cloned into mammalian cell expression vectors, called pSARS-S and pSARS2-S, respectively. Spike protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting after transient expression in HEK293T cells. After immunization, sera were collected for antigen-specific antibody and neutralizing antibody titer analyses. We found that both pSARS-S and pSARS2-S immunization induced similar levels of antibodies against S2 of SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, only pSARS2-S immunization induced antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. We further found that pSARS2-S immunization, but not pSARS-S immunization, could induce very high titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We further analyzed SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific T cell responses and found that the immune responses were biased toward Th1. Importantly, pSARS2-S immunization in hamsters could induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vivo. These data suggest that DNA vaccination could be a promising approach for protecting against COVID-19.","Chai, Kit Man; Tzeng, Tsai-Teng; Shen, Kuan-Yin; Liao, Hung-Chun; Lin, Jhe-Jhih; Chen, Mei-Yu; Yu, Guann-Yi; Dou, Horng-Yunn; Liao, Ching-Len; Chen, Hsin-Wei; Liu, Shih-Jen",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,64,22

Limited epidemiological data on the infections exists in key populations (KPs) in South Africa. We investigated the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV and selected risk factors among these KPs to inform effective responses. METHODS: We used convenience sampling to recruit a targeted 3500 KPs accessing HIV-related health services across Cape Town (SWs, MSM, PWUD/ID), Durban (SWs, PWUD/ID), Pietermaritzburg (SWs), Mthatha (SWs), Port Elizabeth (SWs), Johannesburg (MSM) and Pretoria (MSM and PWUD/ID) into a cross-sectional survey. An interviewer questionnaire to assess socio-demographic characteristics, drug use and sexual risk practices, was administered. HBV surface antigen (HBsAg); HCV antibody, viral load and genotype, and HIV antibody, was tested. RESULTS: Among the 3439 people included in the study (1528 SWs, 746 MSM, 1165 PWUD/ID) the median age was 29 years, most participants were black African (60%), and 24% reported homelessness. 82% reported substance use in the last month, including alcohol (46%) and heroin (33%). 75% were sexually active in the previous month, with condom use at last sex at 74%. HIV prevalence was 37% (highest among SWs at 47%), HBsAg prevalence 4% (similar across KPs) and HCV prevalence was 16% (highest among PWUD/ID at 46%). CONCLUSIONS: HBV, HCV and HIV pose a health burden for KPs in South Africa. While HIV is key for all included KPs, HCV is of particular importance to PWUD/ID. For KPs, HBV vaccination and behavioural change interventions that support consistent condom and lubricant access and use are needed. Coverage of opioid substitution therapy and needle and syringe services, and access to HCV treatment for PWUD/ID need to be expanded.","Scheibe, Andrew; Young, Katherine; Versfeld, Anna; Spearman, C Wendy; Sonderup, Mark W; Prabdial-Sing, Nishi; Puren, Adrian; Hausler, Harry",BMC Infect Dis,64,25

Previous research linked increased susceptibility to collapsing glomerulopathy, including in patients with HIV-associated nephropathy, to apo L1 (APOL1) variants that are more common in those of African descent. METHODS: To investigate genetic, histopathologic, and molecular features in six Black patients with COVID-19 presenting with AKI and de novo nephrotic-range proteinuria, we obtained biopsied kidney tissue, which was examined by in situ hybridization for viral detection and by NanoString for COVID-19 and acute tubular injury-associated genes. We also collected peripheral blood for APOL1 genotyping. RESULTS: This case series included six Black patients with COVID-19 (four men, two women), mean age 55 years. At biopsy day, mean serum creatinine was 6.5 mg/dl and mean urine protein-creatinine ratio was 11.5 g. Kidney biopsy specimens showed collapsing glomerulopathy, extensive foot process effacement, and focal/diffuse acute tubular injury. Three patients had endothelial reticular aggregates. We found no evidence of viral particles or SARS-CoV-2 RNA. NanoString showed elevated chemokine gene expression and changes in expression of genes associated with acute tubular injury compared with controls. All six patients had an APOL1 high-risk genotype. Five patients needed dialysis (two of whom died); one partially recovered without dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Collapsing glomerulopathy in Black patients with COVID-19 was associated with high-risk APOL1 variants. We found no direct viral infection in the kidneys, suggesting a possible alternative mechanism: a ""two-hit"" combination of genetic predisposition and cytokine-mediated host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given this entity's resemblance with HIV-associated nephropathy, we propose the term COVID-19-associated nephropathy to describe it.","Wu, Huijuan; Larsen, Christopher P; Hernandez-Arroyo, Cesar F; Mohamed, Muner M B; Caza, Tiffany; Sharshir, Moh039; Chughtai, Asim; Xie, Liping; Gimenez, Juan M; Sandow, Tyler A; Lusco, Mark A; Yang, Haichun; Acheampong, Ellen; Rosales, Ivy A; Colvin, Robert B; Fogo, Agnes B; Velez, Juan Carlos Q",J Am Soc Nephrol,64,20

To actively prevent the outbreak of COVID-19 by using a national digital transformation program, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health launched project 2628/Quyet dinh-Bo y te, which approved a scheme for remote medical examinations and treatments for 2020 to 2025. The project aims to connect 1000 hospitals to strengthen the quality of medical services by using the expertise of central hospitals to support rural areas via provincial hospitals. Phutho General Hospital (PGH) is one of leading provincial hospitals that participated in and applied the early telehealth systems in Vietnam. By using telehealth systems, PGH can offer valuable support to doctors' activities by streamlining and facilitating their work. Telehealth was demonstrated to be feasible, acceptable, and effective at PGH in Vietnam, and it resulted in considerable improvements in health care outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has facilitated the acceleration and enhancement of telehealth in Vietnam. The success of telehealth in Phutho may be a useful reference for other parts of the world. However, this telehealth system focuses on the connectivity among doctors rather than the connectivity between doctors and patients, which is an area that needs further assessment.","Nguyen, Ngoc Huy; Nguyen, An Quang; Ha, Van Thi Bich; Duong, Phuong Xuan; Nguyen, Thong Van",JMIR Form Res,64,16

The hematopoietic system is responsible for giving rise to the very immune cells that defend against viral infection and is a source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells (HPCs) which are used for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to treat hematologic disorders, thus there is a strong need to understand how exposure to the virus may affect hematopoietic cell functions. We examined the expression of ACE2, to which SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein binds to facilitate viral entry, in cord blood derived HSCs/HPCs and in peripheral blood derived immune cell subtypes. ACE2 is expressed in low numbers of immune cells, higher numbers of HPCs, and up to 65% of rigorously defined HSCs. We also examined effects of exposing HSCs/HPCs and immune cells to SARS-CoV-2 S protein ex vivo. HSCs and HPCs expand less effectively and have less functional colony forming capacity when grown with S protein, while peripheral blood monocytes upregulate CD14 expression and show distinct changes in size and granularity. That these effects are induced by recombinant S protein alone and not the infectious viral particle suggests that simple exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may impact HSCs/HPCs and immune cells via S protein interactions with the cells, regardless of whether they can be infected. These data have implications for immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and for HCT. Graphical Abstract â¢ Human HSCs, HPCs, and immune cells express ACE2 on the cell surface, making them potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. â¢ SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which binds to ACE2, induces defects in the colony forming capacity of human HPC and inhibits the expansion of HSC/HPC subpopulations ex vivo. These effects can be at least partially neutralized by treatment with SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibody, recombinant human ACE2, or Angiotensin1-7. â¢ S protein also induces aberrant morphological changes in peripheral blood derived monocytes ex vivo. â¢ Thus, there are many different manners in which SARS-CoV-2 virus may impact the functional hematopoietic system, which has important implications for hematological manifestations of COVID-19 (i.e. thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia), immune response, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant in the era of COVID-19.","Ropa, James; Cooper, Scott; Capitano, Maegan L; Van039,; t Hof, Wouter; Broxmeyer, Hal E",,64,24

Following two pilot studies analysing spiked samples and material from 698 patients, we conducted a prospective multicentre cross-sectional study, including 867 patients treated with rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban in clinical practice to comprehensively evaluate a simple, readily available anti-Xa assay that would accurately measure drug concentrations and correctly predict relevant levels in clinical practice. Anti-Xa activity was measured by an assay calibrated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in addition to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). As an external validation, LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa activity was also determined in nine external laboratories. The LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa activity correlated strongly with rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban drug levels [rs = 0·98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·98-0·98].

Cadaver dissections were performed to identify and name important surgical landmarks in the suprahyoid area; a histopathologic analysis of surgical specimens was completed to determine the incidence and extent of microscopic disease; and clinical outcomes were compared to determine the efficacy of a specific anatomic dissection. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Standardized dissections of four adult cadavers were performed. Consecutive surgical specimens were examined for evidence of microscopic TDGC disease in the suprahyoid region, measuring the greatest width and length of disease. A retrospective review of all consecutive TGDC procedures was completed. RESULTS: The important surgical landmarks in the suprahyoid area were identified in all cadavers. Microscopic disease in the suprahyoid area was found in 79% (37 of 47) of surgical specimens. The mean greatest length and width of microscopic disease was 12.4 mm and 1.4 mm, respectively. Following identification of these landmarks, the incidence of recurrent or persistent disease decreased (P = .02) from 5% (8 of 159) to 0% (0 of 112). CONCLUSION: The majority of pediatric patients with a TGDC will have microscopic disease in the suprahyoid area. The surgical landmark of the fascial plane between the geniohyoid and genioglossus muscles demarcates the anterior and lateral borders of resection in the suprahyoid area. This approach can be used as a reliable and easily reproducible technique in TGDC surgery to increase confidence of achieving complete removal of disease in the suprahyoid area, avoiding persistent or recurrent disease and a revision procedure.

The pandemic reached the Israeli occupied West Bank of Palestine in early March 2020, and lockdown immediately ensued. Objectives: To assess the prevalence and predictors of distress and insecurity among Birzeit University's community during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Methods: An online survey completed in March-April 2020 using standardized and previously validated distress and insecurity scales. The survey was placed on the University portal accessed by students, faculty and employees, and was sent by email to faculty and employees. Data were weighted to reflect the University community's distribution. Findings: There were 1,851 participants in the study: 84% were undergraduate students, 10% graduate students, and 6% faculty and employees. Sixty two percent were women. Ages ranged from 17 to 70 years (mean 24 ± 9.7). Prevalence of moderate/high distress and insecurity were 40% and 48% respectively. Multiple logistic regression revealed that women, those under 35 years old and those with worse reported income, had significantly higher odds of distress and insecurity compared to their counterparts. Undergraduate students or living with a person at home with high risk of illness with COVID-19 were associated with higher odds of distress compared to their counterparts (OR = 1.56, 95%CI[1.13-2.15]) and (OR = 1.34, 95%CI[1.11-1.62]) respectively. A COVID-19 worry score was significantly associated with higher odds of distress and insecurity (OR = 1.77, 95%CI[1.46-2.14]) and (OR = 4.3, 95%CI[3.53-5.23]) respectively. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the need to pay attention not only to physical health but also to mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among young people, women, those with lower economic status, and those living with high risk persons during the pandemic.

METHODS: A task force was assembled that included 9 rheumatologists/immunologists, 2 infectious disease specialists, and 2 public health physicians. After agreeing on scoping questions, an evidence report was created that summarized the published literature and publicly available data regarding COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and safety, as well as literature for other vaccines in RMD patients. Task force members rated their agreement with draft consensus statements on a 9-point numerical scoring system, using a modified Delphi process and the RAND/University of California Los Angeles Appropriateness Method, with refinement and iteration over 2 sessions. Consensus was determined based on the distribution of ratings. RESULTS: Despite a paucity of direct evidence, 74 draft guidance statements were developed by the task force and agreed upon with consensus to provide guidance for use of the COVID-19 vaccines in RMD patients and to offer recommendations regarding the use and timing of immunomodulatory therapies around the time of vaccination. CONCLUSION: These guidance statements, made in the context of limited clinical data, are intended to provide direction to rheumatology health care providers on how to best use COVID-19 vaccines and to facilitate implementation of vaccination strategies for RMD patients.","Curtis, Jeffrey R; Johnson, Sindhu R; Anthony, Donald D; Arasaratnam, Reuben J; Baden, Lindsey R; Bass, Anne R; Calabrese, Cassandra; Gravallese, Ellen M; Harpaz, Rafael; Kroger, Andrew; Sadun, Rebecca E; Turner, Amy S; Williams, Eleanor Anderson; Mikuls, Ted R",Arthritis Rheumatol,64,16

This study intended to investigate the role of lncRNA nuclear enriched assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) in MPP+-induced PD model in dopaminergic neuronblastoma SK-N-SH cells, as well as its mechanism through sponging miRNA (miR)-1277-5p. Real-time PCR and western blotting revealed that NEAT1 and ARHGAP26 were upregulated, and miR-1277-5p was downregulated in MPP+-treated SK-N-SH cells in a certain of concentration- and time- dependent manner. MPP+ induced apoptosis in SK-N-SH cells, as evidenced by decreased cell viability and Bcl-2 expression, and elevated apoptosis rate and levels of Bax and cleaved caspase-3, which were examined by MTT assay, flow cytometry and western blotting. Moreover, commercial assay kits indicated that inflammatory response and oxidative stress were provoked in response to MPP+, due to promoted contents of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1ß, tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, malondialdehyde, and lactate dehydrogenase, accompanied with suppressed superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase levels. Notably, MPP+-induced apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress in SK-N-SH cells were mitigated by NEAT1 knockdown and/or miR-1277-5p overexpression. Moreover, silencing of miR-1277-5p could abrogate the suppression of NEAT1 deficiency on MPP+-induced cell injury. Similarly, upregulating miR-1277-5p-elicited neuroprotection in MPP+-induced SK-N-SH cells was reversed by ARHGAP26 restoration. Dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated a direct interaction between miR-1277-5p and NEAT1 or ARHGAP26. Collectively, NEAT1 upregulation might contribute to MPP+-induced neuron injury via NEAT1-miR-1277-5p-ARHGAP26 competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) pathway.","Zhou, Shufang; Zhang, Dan; Guo, Junnan; Chen, Zhenzhen; Chen, Yong; Zhang, Junshi",Brain Res,64,20

We evaluated the activity of posaconazole against 2,157 invasive moulds collected worldwide from 2010-2017. The isolates included 1,775 Aspergillus spp. and 382 non-Aspergillus moulds, including 81 Fusarium spp., 62 Mucorales group, and 57 Scedosporium spp. Isolates were tested using the CLSI reference broth microdilution method. Posaconazole showed similar activity to itraconazole and voriconazole against A. fumigatus. Applying published ECV, 98.0% of the A. fumigatus and 97.7% to 100.0% of other common Aspergillus species were wildtype to posaconazole. Categorical agreement between posaconazole and the other azoles tested against A. fumigatus was 98.7%. Notably, most of the Aspergillus spp. isolates recovered from this large collection were wildtype to echinocandins and all azoles. Posaconazole non-wildtype rates of A. fumigatus varied across the different geographic regions, with 2.1% in Europe, 2.2% in North America, 1.8% in Latin America, and 0.7% in the Asia-Pacific region. The frequency of azole non-wildtype A. fumigatus isolates from Europe increased steadily from 2010-2017 for all 3 triazoles (0.0%-5.0%). The azole non-wildtype A. fumigatus rates from the other geographic areas were stable over time. Fusarium and/or Scedosporium spp. isolates were highly resistant to azoles and echinocandins. Posaconazole and amphotericin B were the most active agents against the Mucorales. Posaconazole was very active against most species of Aspergillus and was comparable to itraconazole and voriconazole against the less common moulds. Posaconazole should provide a useful addition to the anti-mould grouping of antifungal agents.","Pfaller, Michael A; Carvalhaes, Cecilia G; Messer, Shawn A; Rhomberg, Paul R; Castanheira, Mariana",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,64,33

We described characteristics of novel coronavirus infection cases and analyzed risk factors for severe outcomes.MethodsCases were persons with laboratory-confirmed novel coronavirus infection reported under national surveillance between January and March 2020. Clinical characteristics were described, and factors associated with severe outcomes (intensive care unit [ICU] admission, invasive ventilation/death) were analyzed using Poisson regression.ResultsAmong the 516 cases analyzed, median age was 60 years (range: 1-97 years) and 285 (55%) were male. Common symptoms/signs were fever (375/475, 79%), cough (353/465, 76%), and pneumonia (245/387, 63%). Ten (2%) cases died. Of the 348 cases with data, 50 (14%) required invasive ventilation. Adjusted for each other, male gender and 1-year increase in age were associated with ICU admission (risk ratio (RR) 4.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.69-10.32 and RR 1.05; 95%CI, 1.03-1.08, respectively) and invasive ventilation/death (RR 2.79; 95%CI, 1.49-5.21 and RR 1.06; 95%CI, 1.04-1.08). Diabetes, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, and lung diseases were also associated with severe outcomes. Of the 80 cases asymptomatic at hospitalization, 40 developed symptoms and five of them >70 years of age required invasive ventilation.ConclusionsThe early stage of the novel coronavirus epidemic in Japan disproportionately affected the elderly. Older age, male gender, and underlying conditions were associated with severe outcomes. Notably, some elderly case-patients who were asymptomatic at diagnosis and promptly hospitalized still went on to develop severe disease, indicating the importance of careful monitoring of certain populations.","Tsuchihashi, Yuuki; Arima, Yuzo; Takahashi, Takuri; Kanou, Kazuhiko; Kobayashi, Yusuke; Sunagawa, Tomimasa; Suzuki, Motoi",J. epidemiol,64,27

In the following days the number of cases started to rise not only in Lombardia but also in other Italian regions, although Lombardia remained and it is still the most affected region in Italy. At the moment, 234801 cases have been identified in Italy, out of which 90070 in Lombardia region. The (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) SARS CoV 2 outbreak in Italy has been characterized by a massive spread of news coming from both official and unofficial sources leading what has been defined as infodemia, an over-abundance of information - some accurate and some not - that has made hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance needed. Infodemia on SARS CoV 2 created the perfect field to build uncertainty in the population, which was scared and not prepared to face this outbreak. It is understandable how the rapid increase of the cases' number , the massive spread of news and the adoption of laws to face this outbreak led to a feeling of anxiety in the population whose everyday life changed very quickly. A way to assess the dynamic burden of social anxiety is a context analysis of major social networks activities over the Internet. To this aim Twitter represents a possible ideal tool since the focused role of the tweets according to the more urgent needs of information and communication rather than general aspects of social projection and debate as in the case of Facebook, which could provide slower responses for the fast individual and social context evolution dynamics. Aim of the paper is to analyse the most common reasons for calling and outcomes. Furthermore, the joint analysis with Twitter trends related to emergency services might be useful to understand possible correlations with epidemic trends and predict new outbreaks.","Castaldi, Silvana; Maffeo, Manuel; Rivieccio, Bruno Alessandro; Zignani, Matteo; Manzi, Giancarlo; Nicolussi, Federica; Salini, Silvia; Micheletti, Alessandra; Gaito, Sabrina; Biganzoli, Elia",Acta Biomed,64,1

However, due to the bottleneck of defining encompasses of real-world high-diversity outliers and inaccessible inference process, individually, most of them have not derived groundbreaking progress. To deal with those imperfectness, and motivated by memory-based decision-making and visual attention mechanism as a filter to select environmental information in human vision perceptual system, in this paper, we propose a Multi-scale Attention Memory with hash addressing Autoencoder network (MAMA Net) for anomaly detection. First, to overcome a battery of problems result from the restricted stationary receptive field of convolution operator, we coin the multi-scale global spatial attention block which can be straightforwardly plugged into any networks as sampling, upsampling and downsampling function. On account of its efficient features representation ability, networks can achieve competitive results with only several level blocks. Second, it's observed that traditional autoencoder can only learn an ambiguous model that also reconstructs anomalies ""well"" due to lack of constraints in training and inference process. To mitigate this challenge, we design a hash addressing memory module that proves abnormalities to produce higher reconstruction error for classification. In addition, we couple the mean square error (MSE) with Wasserstein loss to improve the encoding data distribution. Experiments on various datasets, including two different COVID-19 datasets and one brain MRI (RIDER) dataset prove the robustness and excellent generalization of the proposed MAMA Net.","Chen, Yurong; Zhang, Hui; Wang, Yaonan; Yang, Yimin; Zhou, Xianen; Wu, Q M Jonathan",IEEE Trans Med Imaging,64,3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are immune-compromised and may have a high risk of infection by the SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to detect common transcriptomic signatures and pathways between COVID-19 and CKD by systems biology analysis. We analyzed transcriptomic data obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) infected with SARS-CoV-2 and PBMC of CKD patients. We identified 49 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which were common between COVID-19 and CKD. The gene ontology and pathways analysis showed the DEGs were associated with ""platelet degranulation"", ""regulation of wound healing"", ""platelet activation"", ""focal adhesion"", ""regulation of actin cytoskeleton"" and ""PI3K-Akt signalling pathway"". The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network encoded by the common DEGs showed ten hub proteins (EPHB2, PRKAR2B, CAV1, ARHGEF12, HSP90B1, ITGA2B, BCL2L1, E2F1, TUBB1, and C3). Besides, we identified significant transcription factors and microRNAs that may regulate the common DEGs. We investigated protein-drug interaction analysis and identified potential drugs namely, aspirin, estradiol, rapamycin, and nebivolol. The identified common gene signature and pathways between COVID-19 and CKD may be therapeutic targets in COVID-19 patients with CKD comorbidity.","Rabiul Auwul, Md; Zhang, Chongqi; Rezanur Rahman, Md; Shahjaman, Md; Alyami, Salem A; Ali Moni, Mohammad",,64,16

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes ACE2 as the receptor to enter host cell in a species-specific manner. We and others have previously shown that ACE2 orthologs from New World monkey, koala and mouse cannot interact with SARS-CoV-2 to mediate viral entry, and this defect can be restored by humanization of the restrictive residues in New World monkey ACE2. To better understand the genetic determinants behind the ability of ACE2 orthologs to support viral entry, we compared koala and mouse ACE2 sequences with that of human and identified the key residues in koala and mouse ACE2 that restrict viral receptor activity. Humanization of these critical residues rendered both koala and mouse ACE2 capable of binding the spike protein and facilitating viral entry. Our study shed more lights into the genetic determinants of ACE2 as the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2, which facilitates our understanding of viral entry.","Ren, Wenlin; Zhu, Yunkai; Wang, Yuyan; Shi, Hongyang; Yu, Yin; Hu, Gaowei; Feng, Fei; Zhao, Xiaomin; Lan, Jun; Wu, Jianping; Kenney, Devin J; Douam, Florian; Tong, Yimin; Zhong, Jin; Xie, Youhua; Wang, Xinquan; Yuan, Zhenghong; Zhou, Dongming; Zhang, Rong; Ding, Qiang",PLoS Pathog,64,32

Methodology: We present our experience of a live teleophthalmology link directly connecting an optometrist to tertiary center VR team at the point of retinal detachment presentation within the community. Results: After the COVID-19 lockdown in National Health Service Forth Valley, Emergency Eye Care Treatment Centers have been set up where optometrists are the first point of contact for patients in the community. Live teleophthalmology link has enabled the optometrist in the community to connect directly with local ophthalmologists. From March 23 to June 15, 2020, five referrals were taken for a suspected retinal detachment, and one for submacular hemorrhage. From the receiving ophthalmologists' viewpoint, satisfaction for the quality of sound, video, and connection was 5/5 in all cases on a 5-point Likert grading; from the referring optometrists' viewpoint mean 4.6/5 for sound and video satisfaction, and 5/5 rating in all cases for connection reliability. On 5/6 occasions (83%) the receiving ophthalmologist connected directly with a VR surgeon in a tertiary center. Four-way communication between the patient, optometrist, receiving ophthalmologist, and VR surgeon enabled all five patients to be listed directly for VR surgery from the community, avoiding local ophthalmology department contact during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Overall satisfaction and recommendation to others was rated 5/5 in all instances on a 5-point Likert grading, from the patient, optometrist, and ophthalmologist viewpoint.","Ghazala, Fadi R; Dall039,; Ozzo, Sebastian; McGowan, Gerard; Livingstone, Iain A T",Telemed. j. e. health,64,16

However, the potential for the emergence of antibiotic resistances due to the increased use of antibacterial cleaning products and therapeutics presents an additional, underreported threat. Most antibacterial cleaners contain simple quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), however these compounds are steadily becoming less effective as antibacterial agents. QACs are extensively used in SARS-CoV-2 related sanitization in clinical and household settings. Similarly, due to the danger of secondary infections, antibiotic therapeutics are increasingly used as a component of COVID-19 treatment regimens, even in the absence of a bacterial infection diagnosis.

We aimed to develop a brief measure, the Pandemic Anxiety Scale, to capture the specific aspects of the pandemic that are provoking anxiety, and explore how these vary by health and demographic factors. DESIGN: Data were from a convenience sample of parents (N = 4,793) and adolescents (N = 698) recruited in the first 6 weeks of lockdown. METHODS: Factor analytic and IRT methods were used to validate the new measure in both parent and adolescent samples. Associations between scores on the new measure and age, gender, household income, and physical health status were explored using structural equation modelling (SEM). RESULTS: Two factors were identified in both samples: disease anxiety (e.g., catching, transmitting the virus) and consequence anxiety (e.g., impact on economic prospects); and unique associations with health and demographic factors were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Anxieties due to the COVID-19 are multifaceted, and the PAS is a short, reliable, and valid measure of these concerns. These anxieties are differentially associated with demographic, social, and health factors, which should be considered when developing strategies to mitigate the mental health impact of the pandemic.","McElroy, Eoin; Patalay, Praveetha; Moltrecht, Bettina; Shevlin, Mark; Shum, Adrienne; Creswell, Cathy; Waite, Polly",Br J Health Psychol,64,16

Virus-like particles (VLPs) are a highly immunogenic, safe, and robust approach that can be used to base several vaccine candidates on. Particularly, HIV-1 Gag VLPs is a flexible system comprising a Gag core surrounded by a lipid bilayer that can be modified to present diverse types of membrane proteins or antigens against several diseases, like influenza, dengue, West Nile virus, or human papillomavirus, where it has been proven successful. The size distribution and structural characteristics of produced VLPs vary depending on the cell line used to produce them. In this study, we established an analytical method of characterization for the Gag protein core and clarified the current variability of Gag stoichiometry in HIV-1 VLPs depending on the cell-based production platform, directly determining the number of Gag molecules per VLP in each case. Three Gag peptides have been validated to quantify the number of monomers using parallel reaction monitoring, an accurate and fast, mass-spectrometry-based method that can be used to assess the quality of the produced Gag VLPs regardless of the cell line used. An average of 3617 ± 17 monomers per VLP was obtained for HEK293, substantially varying between platforms, including mammalian and insect cells. This offers a key advantage in quantification and quality control methods to characterize VLP production at a large scale to accelerate new recombinant vaccine production technologies.","Lavado-García, Jesús; Jorge, Inmaculada; Boix-Besora, Arnau; Vázquez, Jesús; Gòdia, Francesc; Cervera, Laura",Biotechnol. bioeng,64,16

In a previous work I have highlighted that the binding of the SARS-CoV spike proteins to the zinc-metalloprotease ACE2 has been shown to induce ACE2 shedding by activating the zinc-metalloprotease ADAM17, which ultimately leads to systemic upregulation of ACE2 activity. Moreover, based on experimental models, it was also shown the detrimental effect of the excessive systemic activity of ACE2 through its downstream pathways, which leads to ""clinical"" manifestations resembling COVID-19. In this regard, strong upregulation of circulating ACE2 activity was recently reported in COVID-19 patients, thus supporting the previous hypothesis that COVID-19 may derive from upregulation of ACE2 activity. Based on this, a reasonable hypothesis of using inhibitors that curb the upregulation of both ACE2 and ADAM17 zinc-metalloprotease activities and consequent positive feedback-loops (initially triggered by SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently sustained independently on viral trigger) is proposed as therapy for COVID-19. In particular, zinc-chelating agents such as citrate and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) alone or in combination are expected to act in protecting from COVID-19 at different levels thanks to their both anticoagulant properties and inhibitory activity on zinc-metalloproteases. Several arguments are presented in support of this hypothesis and based on the current knowledge of both beneficial/harmful effects and cost/effectiveness, the use of chelating agents in the prevention and therapy of COVID-19 is proposed. In this regard, clinical trials (currently absent) employing citrate/EDTA in COVID-19 are urgently needed in order to shed more light on the efficacy of zinc chelators against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo.","Zamai, Loris",,64,3

We identified a unique opportunity to bring comprehensive and targeted anatomic pathology training to large numbers of medical students who would not receive it otherwise but also need credited coursework. METHODS: We developed a comprehensive 2-week remote-learning course encompassing lectures, virtual slides, discussion groups, and unique case-based activities. Activities are tailored to the nonpathologist future clinician, emphasizing basic microscopy and pathology terminology. We employ multiple strategies and technologies to increase engagement while distance learning, including screen annotation, ""flipped classroom"" slide presentations, and repetition of common themes. RESULTS: Given 13 virtual courses to choose between 13% of students enrolled in our course (70 of our 540 rising third- and fourth-year students), a nearly 10-fold increase in average pathology rotators. CONCLUSIONS: This is an unprecedented opportunity to provide tailored anatomic pathology instruction, both helping our medical students continue training during crisis and illuminating the field of pathology for our future colleagues.

This includes new innovative technologies and strategies being developed by educators to foster the rapid learning-recovery and reinstatement of the stakeholders (e.g., teachers and students). Indeed, the main challenge for educators has been on what appropriate steps should be taken to prevent learning loss for the students; ranging from how to provide efficient learning tools/curriculum that ensures continuity of learning, to provision of methods that incorporate coping mechanisms and acceleration of education in general. For several higher educational institutions (HEIs), technology-mediated education has become an integral part of the modern teaching/learning instruction amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, when digital technologies have consequently become an inevitable and indispensable part of learning. To this effect, this study defines a hybrid educational model (HyFlex + Tec) used to enable virtual and in-person education in the HEIs. Practically, the study utilized data usage report from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Emotions and Experience Survey questionnaire in a higher education setting for its experiments. To this end, we applied an Exponential Linear trend model and Forecasting method to determine overall progress and statistics for the learners during the Covid-19 pandemic, and subsequently performed a Text Mining and Univariate Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to determine effects and significant differences that the teaching-learning experiences for the teachers and students have on their energy (learning motivation) levels. From the results, we note that the hybrid learning model supports continuity of education/learning for teachers and students during the Covid-19 pandemic. The study also discusses its innovative importance for future monitoring (tracking) of learning experiences and emotional well-being for the stakeholders in leu (aftermath) of the Covid-19 pandemic.","Okoye, Kingsley; Rodriguez-Tort, Jorge Alfonso; Escamilla, Jose; Hosseini, Samira",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),64,26

Here we show that this hypothesis relies on incorrect or weak assumptions, and does not agree with the results of comparative genomics analysis. The genetic divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and both its proposed ancestors is too high to have accumulated in a lab, given the timeframe of several years. Furthermore, comparative analysis of S-protein gene sequences suggests that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 probably represents an ancestral non-recombinant variant.

The model uses three, color-coded components, called molecules (red for infected and still contagious; green for infected, but no longer contagious; and blue for uninfected). In retrospect, the model turns out to be a digital analogue for the well-known SIR model of Kermac and McKendrick (1927). In our RGB model, the number of accumulated infections goes through three phases, beginning at a very low level, then changing to a transition ramp of rapid growth, and ending in a plateau of final values. Consequently, the differential change or growth rate begins at 0, rises to a peak corresponding to the maximum slope of the transition ramp, and then falls back to 0. The properties of these time variations, including the slope, duration, and height of the transition ramp, and the width and height of the infection rate, depend on a single parameter - the time that a red molecule is contagious divided by the average time between collisions of the molecules. Various temporal milestones, including the starting time of the transition ramp, the time that the accumulating number of infections obtains its maximum slope, and the location of the peak of the infection rate depend on the size of the population in addition to the contagious lifetime ratio. Explicit formulas for these quantities are derived and summarized. Finally, Appendix E has been added to describe the effect of vaccinations.","Sheeley, Neil R.",,64,6

Molecular docking and patch clamp experiments showed that HCQ could bind to hERG and inhibit the efflux of potassium ion preferentially in the repolarization stage. The IC50 of HCQ was 8.6 µM ± 0.8 µM. FQs, which are quinoline derivatives, could also bind to hERG molecules. The binding energies of FQs varied according to their molecular polarity. It was found that drugs with a quinoline structure, particularly with high molecular polarity, can exert a significant potential hERG inhibitory activity. The potential side effects of QT prolongation during the development and use of quinolines should be carefully considered.","Yu, Ran; Li, Peng",Toxicology,64,24

The purpose of this study was to determine if a 6-week intervention, including outreach, education, and incentive, by a community-based health insurance company could improve uptake of HCV antibody screening among the 1945-1965 birth cohort. Individuals were eligible to participate in this campaign if they were born on or after January 1, 1945 and on or before December 31, 1965, had health insurance with Sendero Health Plans during the intervention period, and had no evidence of having received an HCV antibody test prior to the campaign start date. The 6-week campaign period was from November 14, 2018 through December 31, 2018. A gift card incentive was provided if HCV screening was completed on or before December 31, 2018. A total of 5287 individuals were eligible to participate in the campaign.

Study Design A purposive cross-sectional study of quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic was performed. Methods Respondents completed a modified questionnaire that determined the Impact of Event Scale (IES), indicators of psychological distress impact, impact on government strategies, awareness and lifestyles, and impact on expectation of quality life change. A total of 465 (male = 330 and female = 135) respondents participated in this study. Results The overall mean age of respondents was 28.42 ± 7.07 years, and 63.4%, 44.1% and 50.3% were unmarried, were in the middle-income family group and had a masters or PhD qualification, respectively. The overall mean IES score of respondents was 80.89 ± 8.91, which reflects a stressful impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health problems. Only 27.75% of respondents had an IES score ≥75. More than half of respondents (57.8%) reported that they did not feel lonely and hopeless. In terms of preventative measures, he majority of the respondents (80.2%) reported that they did not wash their hands frequently with soap and sanitiser for at least 20 seconds to reduce spread of the virus. During the pandemic, more than half of the respondents (56.8%) claimed that they faced serious problems in education.

In fact, knowledges of pathophysiology of this new disease are still in development and hence originate discussions and interpretations. Regarding the role of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, these mechanisms should be considered as crucial especially in severe cases. It is proposed to consider two distinct phenotypes of thrombotic manifestations: the current ""thromboembolic type"" also occurring in other kinds of sepsis, and the diffuse micro-thrombotic type, prevailing in the lungs but sometimes extending to other organs. Both types can induce severe disease and are potentially lethal. The micro-thrombotic pattern, more specific for COVID-19, results from a massive activation of coagulation strictly coupled with a hyper-intense inflammatory and immune reaction. This results in widespread occlusive thrombotic micro-angiopathy with destruction of alveoli and obstructive neoangiogenesis. The involvement of fibrinolysis, often neglected, confers a double faceted process of activation/inhibition, finally conducive to a fibrinolytic shutdown that reinforces persistence of micro-thrombi. Considering these peculiar mechanisms, it seems evident that both prophylactic and therapeutic effects of current anti-thrombotic drugs cannot be taken for granted and need therefore new specific and rigorous controlled trials.","Coccheri, Sergio",Intern Emerg Med,64,24

It is generally accepted that the origin of the term can be traced back nearly one hundred years referencing certain agricultural practices in the context of controlling livestock health. Today, the term biosecurity can be widely seen in the laboratory environment, the media, in the context of biodefense, throughout government agencies and ministries worldwide, in discussions of genetically-modified organisms, agriculture, and information technology. Concerns of global health and security could not be more relevant than today, given the paradigm shifts manifested by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the resulting coronavirus pandemic. This book will focus on the challenges that this and future pandemic events will bring and offer biosecurity as a set of practices to aid in humanity’s combat of devastating emerging infectious diseases. To further add complexity to the definition are the rapid advances in technologies that challenge our understanding of how to apply biosecurity principles and practices. Finally, unlike the well-established field of biological safety (i.e., biosafety), there remains a lack of credentialing programs to define a “biosecurity professional.” Taken together, our modern and technologically-driven world is in need redefining what biosecurity means and how it is practiced. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Burnette, R.

Using publicly available COVID-19 transcriptomic datasets, we conducted an in-silico analyses to evaluate the expression levels of 125 oxidative stress genes, including 37 pro-oxidant genes, 32 oxidative-responsive genes, and 56 antioxidant genes. Seven oxidative stress genes were found to be upregulated in whole blood and lung autopsies (MPO, S100A8, S100A9, SRXN1, GCLM, SESN2, and TXN); these genes were higher in severe versus non-severe COVID-19 leucocytes. Oxidative genes were upregulated in inflammatory cells comprising macrophages and CD8+ T cells isolated from bronchioalveolar fluid (BALF), and neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood. MPO, S100A8, and S100A9 were top most upregulated oxidative markers within COVID-19's lung autopsies, whole blood, leucocytes, BALF derived macrophages and circulating neutrophils. The calprotectin's, S100A8 and S100A9 were upregulated in SARS-COV-2 infected human lung epithelium. To validate our in-silico analysis, we conducted qRT-PCR to measure MPO and calprotectin's levels in blood and saliva samples. Relative to uninfected donor controls, MPO, S100A8 and S100A9 were significantly higher in blood and saliva of severe versus asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Compared to other different viral respiratory infections, coronavirus infection showed a prominent upregulation in oxidative stress genes with MPO and calprotectin at the top of the list. In conclusion, SARS-COV-2 induce the expression of oxidative stress genes via both immune as well as lung structural cells. The observed correlation between oxidative stress genes dysregulation and COVID-19 disease severity deserve more attention. Mechanistical studies are required to confirm the correlation between oxidative stress gene dysregulation, COVID-19 severity, and the net oxidative stress balance.","Saheb Sharif-Askari, Narjes; Saheb Sharif-Askari, Fatemeh; Mdkhana, Bushra; Hussain Alsayed, Hawra Ali; Alsafar, Habiba; Alrais, Zeyad Faoor; Hamid, Qutayba; Halwani, Rabih",Free Radic Biol Med,64,16

The contagion became pandemic in few months forcing many Countries to declare lockdown status. In this context of quarantine, all commercial and productive activities are suspended, and many Countries are experiencing a serious crisis. To this aim, the understanding of risk of contagion in every urban district is fundamental for governments and administrations to establish reopening strategies. This paper proposes the calibration of an index able to predict the risk of contagion in urban districts in order to support the administrations in identifying the best strategies to reduce or restart the local activities during lockdown conditions. The objective regards the achievement of a useful tool to predict the risk of contagion by considering socio-economic data such as the presence of activities, companies, institutions and number of infections in urban districts. The proposed index is based on a factorial formula, simple and easy to be applied by practitioners, calibrated by using an optimization-based procedure and exploiting data of 257 urban districts of Apulian region (Italy). Moreover, a comparison with a more refined analysis, based on the training of Artificial Neural Networks, is performed in order to take into account the non-linearity of the phenomenon. The investigation quantifies the influence of each considered parameter in the risk of contagion useful to obtain risk analysis and forecast scenarios.","Sangiorgio, Valentino; Parisi, Fabio",Saf.

However, public opinion reports an associated subjective shortness of breath. We evaluated cardiorespiratory parameters at rest and during maximal exertion to highlight any differences with the use of protection masks. METHODS: Twelve healthy subjects underwent three cardiopulmonary exercise tests: without wearing protection mask, with surgical and with FFP2 mask. Dyspnea was assessed by Borg Scale. Standard pulmonary function tests were also performed. RESULTS: All the subjects (40.8±12.4â years; 6 males) completed the protocol with no adverse event. At spirometry, from no mask to surgical to FFP2, a progressive reduction of FEV1 and FVC was observed (3.94±0.91â l, 3.23±0.81â l, 2.94±0.98â l and 4.70±1.21â l, 3.77±1.02â l, 3.52±1.21â l, respectively, p<0.001). Rest ventilation, O2 uptake (VÌO2) and CO2 production (VCO2) were progressively lower with a reduction of respiratory rate. At peak exercise, subjects revealed a progressively higher Borg scale when wearing surgical and FFP2. Accordingly, at peak exercise, VÌO2 (31.0±23.4, 27.5±6.9, 28.2±8.8â ml/kg/min, p=0.001), ventilation (92±26, 76±22, 72±21â l, p=0.003), respiratory rate (42±8, 38±5, 37±4, p=0.04) and tidal volume (2.28±0.72, 2.05±0.60, 1.96±0.65â l, p=0.001) were gradually lower. We did not observed a significant difference in oxygen saturation. CONCLUSIONS: Protection masks are associated with significant but modest worsening of spirometry and cardiorespiratory parameters at rest and peak exercise. The effect is driven by a ventilation reduction due to an increased airflow resistance. However, since exercise ventilatory limitation is far from being reached, their use is safe even during maximal exercise, with a slight reduction in performance.","Mapelli, Massimo; Salvioni, Elisabetta; De Martino, Fabiana; Mattavelli, Irene; Gugliandolo, Paola; Vignati, Carlo; Farina, Stefania; Palermo, Pietro; Campodonico, Jeness; Maragna, Riccardo; Lo Russo, Gerardo; Bonomi, Alice; Sciomer, Susanna; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe",Eur. respir. j,64,1

Design: and Methods: We collected fresh plasma aliquots from 17 patients (LDH range, 281 to 822 U/L) and seven controls (LDH < 230 U/L). In-gel relative activity of the different LDH isoenzymes was determined by electrophoresis and densitometric analysis. Results: Despite the expected higher total LDH activity levels in patients (p<0.001), the in-gel relative activities of LDH isoenzymes did not differ between patients and controls (all p>0.05). We found no correlation between total plasma LDH activity and the in-gel relative activities of the different LDH isoenzymes, including LDH-3. Likewise, there was no correlation between LDH-3 and various routine haematological and serum parameters that have been previously reported to be altered in COVID-19 (such as lymphocyte count, albumin, alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, C-reactive protein, or ferritin). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that elevation of plasma LDH activity in patients with COVID-19 is not associated to a specific release of LDH-3 into the bloodstream, and do not support the use of LDH as a specific biomarker for lung affectation in patients with COVID-19.","Serrano-Lorenzo, Pablo; Coya, Olga N; López-Jimenez, Ana; Blázquez, Alberto; Delmiro, Aitor; Lucía, Alejandro; Arenas, Joaquín; Martín, Miguel A",Pract Lab Med,64,16

those with more severe symptoms The study presents three relevant messages First, it is necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the Brazilian population, allowing more time for the reorganization of the supply and relieve the pressure on the health system Second, the expansion of the number of available beds will be the key Even if the private sector helps offset the deficit, the combined supply from the two sectors (public and private) would be insufficient in various macro-regions The construction of field hospitals is important, both in places with a history of &quot;hospital

National CTSA Steering Committee meetings provided an opportunity to share best practices and develop the idea of capturing the CTSA program experiences in a series of papers. Here we bring together the recommendations from those papers in a list of specific actions that research sites can take to strengthen operations and prepare for similar future public health emergencies.

SwIAV infection induces a strong interferon alpha (IFNa) response and IFNa was shown to abrogate PRRSV2 MLV replication and an inherent immune response. In this study, we evaluated the impacts of swIAV infection on the replication of a PRRSV1 MLV (MLV1), post-vaccine immune responses and post-challenge vaccine efficacy at both the systemic and pulmonary levels. Piglets were either swIAV inoculated and MLV1 vaccinated 6 h apart or singly vaccinated or mock inoculated and mock vaccinated. Four weeks after vaccination, the piglets were challenged with a PRRSV1 field strain. The results showed that swIAV infection delayed MLV1 viremia by six days and post-vaccine seroconversion by four days. After the PRRSV1 challenge, the swIAV enhanced the PRRSV1-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) but the PRRSV1 field strain viremia was not better controlled. High IFNa levels that were detected early after swIAV infection could have been responsible for both the inhibition of MLV1 replication and CMI enhancement. Thus, whereas swIAV infection had a negative impact on humoral responses post-vaccination, it did not interfere with the protective effectiveness of the PRRSV MLV1 in our experimental conditions.","Renson, Patricia; Deblanc, Céline; Bougon, Juliette; Le Dimna, Mireille; Gorin, Stéphane; Mahé, Sophie; Barbier, Nicolas; Paboeuf, Frédéric; Simon, Gaëlle; Bourry, Olivier",Vaccines (Basel),64,18

Women cannot visit healthcare facilities because of a fear of curfew-related sanctions or exposure to COVID-19. It is seen that religious beliefs are influential especially in terms of family planning method preference and having abortions. This study was conducted to determine the attitudes of married Muslim women regarding family planning methods during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted with 611 married Muslim women who presented to the family planning outpatient clinic of a public hospital in Western Turkey between 1 September 2020 and 1 March 2021. The mean Family Planning Attitude Scale score of the women was found to be 137.53 ± 27.11. It was observed that, as the mean age of the women increased, their family planning attitudes were more positive, and as their number of pregnancies, abortions and living children increased, their attitudes were more negative (p < 0.05). Women do not want to get pregnant during the pandemic process. This is because the effects of COVID-19 on both themselves and the baby to be born are not known, which worries women. Therefore, in order to transform positive attitudes regarding family planning into behavior, it is recommended to provide effective training and consultancy services during the pandemic period.","Dal, Nursel Alp; Beydağ, Kerime Derya",J Relig Health,64,20

Bottlenecks in availability of ventilators and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may contribute to mortality, implying ethically difficult rationing decisions. It is unclear if accelerated equipment production will meet demand, calling for fallback solutions for life support in worst-case scenarios. Methods: Veno-venous extracorporeal gas exchange (VV-ECMO) can provide vital support in bilateral lung failure. VV-ECMO essentially comprises large flow venous accesses, membrane gas exchange, and a blood pump. As thousands of FDA and CE certified Impella blood pumps and consoles are distributed globally for cardiac support, we explored ad-hoc assembly of lean ECMO systems by embedding Impella pumps coaxially in tubes in combination with standard gas exchangers. Results: Ad-hoc integration of Impella blood pumps with gas exchange modules, standard cannulas for large bore venous access, regular ECMO tubing, Y-pieces and connectors led to lean ECMO systems with stable performance over several days. Oxygenation of 2.5-5 L of blood/minute is realistic. Benefit/risk analysis appears favorable if a patient requires respiratory support but cannot be supported because of lack of ventilators or unavailability of a required ECMO system. Conclusion: Ad-hoc assembly of veno-venous ECMOs using Impella pumps is feasible and results in stable blood flow across gas exchange modules. However, such off-label use of the devices calls for specific ethical and regulatory considerations prior to their use as last resort in patients for whom no other treatment modalities are available.","Hunziker, P.; Zenklusen, U.",,64,1

Locating science education within the traditions of critical pedagogy allows us to interrogate some of the historical, theoretical, and practical contradictions that have challenged the field, and to consider science learning as part of a wider struggle for social justice in education. My analysis draws specifically on the intellectual ideas of Paulo Freire, whose work continues to influence issues of theoretical, political, and pedagogical importance. A leading social thinker in educational practice, Freire rejected the dominant hegemonic view that classroom discourse is a neutral and value-free process removed from the juncture of cultural, historical, social, and political contexts. Freire’s ideas offer several themes of relevance to this discussion, including his banking conception of education, dialog and conscientization, and teaching as a political activity. I attempt to show how these themes can be used to advance a more socially critical and democratic approach to science teaching.","Lodge, Wilton",Cult Stud Sci Educ,64,1

SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with high cytokine levels, including interleukin-6 and certain subsets of immune cells, in particular, NK, distinguished according to the cell surface density of CD56. Cytokine levels are inversely correlated with lymphocyte count, therefore cytokine release syndrome may be an impediment to the adaptive immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-1β is under investigation for the treatment of severe SAR-CoV-2 infection. An 85 year old male presenting in our hospital with COVID-19, whose condition was complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome and cardiac and renal failure (with oliguria) after 25 days of hospitalization, was intubated and received canakinumab for compassionate use. On the next day, diuresis recovered and conditions improved: high IL-6 levels and NK cells expressing CD56(bright) (associated with cytokine relase) were significantly reduced giving rise to NK CD56(dim).

The aim of this article is to review current literature data for multidisciplinary team (MDT) coordination, rational management of resources and facilities, ensuring timely medical care for large vessel occlusion (LVO) AIS patients requiring endovascular treatment during the pandemic. Methods: A detailed literature search was performed in Google Scholar and PubMed databases using these keywords and their combinations: acute ischaemic stroke, emergency, anaesthesia, airway management, mechanical thrombectomy, endovascular treatment, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19. Published studies and guidelines from inception to April 2021 were screened. The following nonsystematic review is based on a comprehensive literature search of available data, wherein 59 were chosen for detailed analysis. Results: The pandemic has an impact on every aspect of AIS care, including prethrombectomy, intraprocedural and post-thrombectomy issues. Main challenges include institutional preparedness, increased number of AIS patients with multiorgan involvement, different work coordination principles and considerations about preferred anaesthetic technique. Care of these patients is led by MDT and nonoperating room anaesthesia (NORA) principles are applied. Conclusions: Adequate management of AIS patients requiring mechanical thrombectomy during the pandemic is of paramount importance to maximise the benefit of the endovascular procedure. MDT work and familiarity with NORA principles decrease the negative impact of the disease on the clinical outcomes for AIS patients.","Grigonyte, Milda; Kraujelyte, Agne; Januskeviciute, Elija; Semys, Giedrius; Kriukelyte, Oresta; Kontrimaviciute, Egle; Valeviciene, Nomeda Rima; Jatuzis, Dalius",Int J Environ Res Public Health,64,1

We aim to demonstrate whether mask wearing may lead to increased errors incidence in radiology reports. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our prospective studywas conveyed in 2 parts. Firstly, the participants were surveyed if they believed that mask affected dictation. Then participants performed a dictation: they read artificial radiology reports using a commercial voice recognition (VR) system. They performed this task 5 times, each time donning a different mask in random order: a surgical mask, surgical visor, N-95, combination of 2 surgical masks and no mask. Error rates were compared with the Friedman test followed by pairwise Wilcoxon with bootstrapping. Multivariate Poisson regression was performed to test for interaction effects between potential predictors. RESULTS: 52 members of an academic radiology department participatedin the study (January - March 2021) . 65.4% of survey participants did not think or were not sure whether mask wearing could affect dictation process. Treating the no-mask condition as baseline, our study found that mean error rates significantly increased up to 2 times the baseline rate when a surgical mask, surgical visor, N-95 or a combination of 2 masks was donned (p < 0.0001). No significant differences in error rates were found between the different mask types (p > 0.05). Error rates were higher for participants with shorter VR training time (p < 0.0001) or who were non-native English speakers (p < 0.0001). There were no interaction effects between mask type, VR training time or English nativity, suggesting these variables to be independent predictors for error rate. Academic rank did not significantly affect the error rate. CONCLUSION: radiologists underestimate the influence of masks on dictation accuracy. mask wearing may lead to significant increase in dictational errors.","Pietrzyk, Aneta Kecler; Eldehimi, Fatma; Nicolaou, Savvas; Yu, Shu Min; Forster, Bruce B",Can Assoc Radiol J,64,26

The objective of our study is to examine the quality of COVID-19 related health information over the internet using the DISCERN tool. METHODS: The keywords included in assessment of COVID-19 related information using Google's search engine were “Coronavirus,” “Coronavirus causes,” “Coronavirus diagnosis,” “Coronavirus prevention,” and “Coronavirus management”. The first 20 websites from each search term were gathered to generate a list of 100 URLs. Duplicate sites were excluded from this search, allowing analysis of unique sites only. Additional exclusion criteria included scientific journals, nonoperational links, nonfunctional websites (where the page was not loading, was not found, or was inactive), and websites in languages other than English.

However, studies that directly relate hospitalizations for exacerbation of COPD to ambient temperature are lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of temperature on the number of hospitalizations for COPD. METHODS: This was a population-based study in a metropolitan area. All hospital discharges for acute exacerbation of COPD during 2009 in Barcelona and its metropolitan area were analyzed. The relationship between the number of hospitalizations for COPD and the mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures alongside comorbidity, humidity, influenza rate, and environmental pollution were studied. RESULTS: A total of 9,804 hospitalization discharges coded with COPD exacerbation as a primary diagnosis were included; 75.4% of cases were male with a mean age of 74.9±10.5 years and an average length of stay of 6.5±6.1 days. The highest number of admissions (3,644 [37.2%]) occurred during winter, followed by autumn with 2,367 (24.1%), spring with 2,347 (23.9%), and summer with 1,446 (14.7%; P<0.001). The maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures were associated similarly with the number of hospitalizations. On average, we found that for each degree Celsius decrease in mean weekly temperature, hospital admissions increased by 5.04% (r(2)=0.591; P<0.001). After adjustment for humidity, comorbidity, air pollution, and influenza-like illness, only mean temperatures retained statistical significance, with a mean increase of 4.7% in weekly admissions for each degree Celsius of temperature (r(2)=0.599, P<0.001).

Teachers were required to put remote teaching and learning in place with only two days’ notice from the government. AIMS: The current study explores teachers’ experiences of this abrupt change to their working practices, and during the 5–6 weeks that followed. SAMPLE: Twenty‐four teachers from English state schools were interviewed, representing mainstream primary and secondary schools and a range of years of experience and seniority. METHODS: Participants were asked to tell stories of three key scenes during the first 5–6 weeks of lockdown: a low point, a high point, and a turning point. A reflexive thematic analysis of their narratives was conducted. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Six themes were identified: uncertainty, finding a way, worry for the vulnerable, importance of relationships, teacher identity, and reflections. Teachers’ narratives suggest that, after an initial period of uncertainty they settled into the situation and found a way forward, supported by strong relationships. However, they remain extremely worried about the most vulnerable pupils and want more joined‐up thinking from the government on how to support them effectively, along with clarity from policymakers to enable planning ahead. Teachers reflected on how to use their learning during this period to improve pupils’ experiences of education post‐COVID‐19, and on how aspects of shared teacher identity have worked as stressors and coping mechanisms.

Results Although the growth rate sharply increased by more than 1.2% in the late January 2020, the cumulative number of cases remained below 1500 around the world. The epidemic growth curve in Turkey was very similar to the US and Italy during the period. The case-fatality rate in Turkey was 2.51%, which below the countries with the most cases, except Russia, and the recovery–death ratio appeared to be at a moderate level among these countries.

After mice were immunized intramuscularly with pcDNAM, pcDNAN or pcDNASa–pcDNASb plasmid, blood was collected and serum was separated. Humoral immune response was detected with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and cellular immune response of SARS-Cov DNA vaccines was detected with lymphoproliferation assay and cytotoxic T lymphocyte assay. Results show that cellular and humoral immune responses can be detected after immunization with pcDNAM, pcDNAN or pcDNASa–pcDNASb plasmids in BALB/c mice. However, pcDNAM stimulated the highest cellular immune response than other plasmids, and pcDNASa–pcDNASb stimulated the highest humoral immune response in week 12. The present results not only suggest that DNA immunization with pcDNAM, pcDNAN or pcDNASa–pcDNASb could be used as potential DNA vaccination approaches to induce antibody in BALB/c mice, but also to illustrate that gene immunization with these SARS DNA vaccines different immune response characters.","Wang, Zhijun; Yuan, Zhenghong; Matsumoto, Mitsuharu; Hengge, Ulrich R.; Chang, Yung-Fu",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,64,26

Because genetic sequencing is a part of routine care for HIV infected persons, health departments have extensive sequence collections spanning years and even decades of the HIV epidemic. How should these data be used (or not) in public health practice? This is a complex, multi-faceted question that weighs personal risks against public health benefit. The answer is neither straightforward nor universal. However, to make that judgement—of how genetic sequence data should be used in describing and combating the HIV epidemic—we need a clear image of what a phylogenetically enhanced HIV surveillance system can do and what benefit it might provide. In this paper, we present a positive case for how up-to-date analysis of HIV sequence databases managed by health departments can provide unique and actionable information of how HIV is spreading in local communities. We discuss this question broadly, with examples from the US, as it is globally relevant for all health authorities that collect HIV genetic data.","Romero-Severson, Ethan; Nasir, Arshan; Leitner, Thomas",Viruses,64,27

Tools that can improve the focus of surveillance efforts and clinical decision support are of paramount importance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to illustrate how new medical informatics technologies may enable effective control of the pandemic through the development and successful 72-hour deployment of the Honghu Hybrid System (HHS) for COVID-19 in the city of Honghu in Hubei, China. METHODS: The HHS was designed for the collection, integration, standardization, and analysis of COVID-19-related data from multiple sources, which includes a case reporting system, diagnostic labs, electronic medical records, and social media on mobile devices. RESULTS: HHS supports four main features: syndromic surveillance on mobile devices, policy-making decision support, clinical decision support and prioritization of resources, and follow-up of discharged patients. The syndromic surveillance component in HHS covered over 95% of the population of over 900,000 people and provided near real time evidence for the control of epidemic emergencies. The clinical decision support component in HHS was also provided to improve patient care and prioritize the limited medical resources. However, the statistical methods still require further evaluations to confirm clinical effectiveness and appropriateness of disposition assigned in this study, which warrants further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: The facilitating factors and challenges are discussed to provide useful insights to other cities to build suitable solutions based on cloud technologies.

However, studies mostly focused on dyadic and unidirectional influences of parents on their children. Studies addressing influences arising from daily family life and including family-level influences are rare and the existing studies solely focus on the relevance for children’s health or health-related behaviors. We use a qualitative approach to explore how daily family life and its inherent health-related cues affect family members’ physical activity and eating behavior. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews utilizing an interview guide were conducted. Since we aimed to examine family life, we analyzed both parents’ and their children’s views on health-related interaction patterns and family environmental influences on individuals’ health-related behavior. Twenty-two members of seven families were interviewed. Transcripts of the interviews were systematically analyzed following Grounded Theory principles. RESULTS: The interviews revealed that various individual as well as environmental factors shape health-related aspects of daily family life. A model was developed that organizes these influencing factors on family life with regard to health-related interactions and the emergence of the Family Health Climate (FHC) – reflecting shared perceptions and cognitions regarding a healthy lifestyle within families – and its consequences. Family interactions and family time, often realized through shared family meals, are key factors for families’ health with regard to nutrition and physical activity. The FHC showed to affect various aspects related to health behavior of individual family members. CONCLUSIONS: The model sheds light on underlying processes and mechanisms of family life that influences individuals’ health-related behavior. Based on a better understanding of the association between family life and individual health behavior the development of family-based interventions can be informed. Furthermore, the insights can help to guide further research focusing on families as a system.","Wäsche, Hagen; Niermann, Christina; Bezold, Jelena; Woll, Alexander",BMC Public Health,64,8

Understanding inter-individual variation has important implications for not only allocation of resources but also targeting patients for escalation of care, inclusion in clinical trials, individualized medical therapy including vaccination. In addition to geographic location and social vulnerability, there are clear biological differences such as age, sex, race, presence of comorbidities, underlying genetic variation and differential immune response that contribute to variability in disease manifestation. These differences may have implications for precision medicine. Specific examples include the observation that androgens regulate the expression of TMPRSS2 which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into the cell; therefore androgen deprivation therapy is being explored as a treatment option in males infected with COVID-19. An immunophenotyping study of COVID-19 patients has demonstrated that a subset develop T cytopenia which has prompted a clinical trial that is testing the efficacy of interleukin-7 in these patients. Predicting which COVID-19 patients develop progressive disease that required hospitalization has important implications for clinical trials that target outpatients. Enrollment of patients at low risk for progression of disease and hospitalization would likely not result in such therapy demonstrating efficacy. There are efforts to use artificial intelligence to integrate digital data from smart watch applications or digital monitoring systems and biological data to enable identification of the high risk COVID-19 patient. The ultimate goal of precision medicine using such modern technology is to recognize individual differences to improve health for all.","Pereira, Naveen L.; Ahmad, Ferhaan; Cummins, Nathan W.; Byku, Mirnela; Morris, Alanna A.; Owens, Anjali; Tuteja, Sony; Cresci, Sharon",Mayo Clin Proc,64,6

However, there is a lack of simplified accurate source models that can represent the airborne release to be utilized in the safe-social distancing measures and ventilation design of buildings. Although computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can provide accurate models of airborne disease transmissions, they are computationally expensive. Thus, this study proposes an innovative framework that benefits from a series of relatively accurate CFD simulations to first generate a dataset of respiratory events and then develop a simplified source model. The dataset has been generated based on key clinical parameters (i.e., the velocity of droplet release) and environmental factors (i.e., room temperature and relative humidity) in the droplet release modes. An Eulerian CFD model is first validated against experimental data and is then interlinked with a Lagrangian CFD model to simulate trajectory and evaporation of numerous droplets in various sizes (0.1 μm–700 μm). A risk assessment model previously developed by the authors is then applied to the simulation cases to identify the horizontal and vertical spread lengths (risk cloud) of viruses in each case within an exposure time. Eventually, an artificial neural network-based model is fitted to the spread lengths to develop the simplified predictive source model. The results identify three main regimes of risk clouds, which can be fairly predicted by the ANN model.","Mirzaei, P.A.; Moshfeghi, M.; Motamedi, H.; Sheikhnejad, Y.; Bordbar, H.",Build Environ,64,26

Gut microbiota may also play important roles in COVID-19 pathogenesis. However, the association between gut microbiota and fever in individuals with moderate COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS: We compared the clinical features and laboratory results of 187 moderate COVID-19 patients with fever and without fever and identified several inflammatory markers in patients with fever. Then, we performed gut metagenome-wide association study for 31 individuals to identify the microbes and their epitopes which have potential role in fever and hyperinflammation. RESULTS: Among 187 moderate COVID-19 patients, 127 (67.9%) patients presented with fever. Lymphocytes, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells were significantly reduced, while AST, LDH, CRP, IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly elevated in patients with fever. Gut microbiome composition was significantly altered in patients with fever compared with those with non-fever. Opportunistic pathogens such as Enterococcus faecalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were enriched in patients with fever. E. faecalis was positively correlated with LDH and D-dimer and negatively correlated with CD8+T cells and IL-4, while S. cerevisiae was positively correlated with diarrhea symptom. Furthermore, several species with anti-inflammatory and protective effects, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Eubacterium ramulus, were enriched in patients with non-fever. B. fragilis was positively correlated with lymphocytes, and E. ramulus was negatively correlated with LDH, AST and IL-6. Finally, we found that several bacterial epitopes of GroEL, a homolog of human HSP60, were enriched in patients with fever and positively correlated with IL-6, IL-10, WBC, neutrophils, D-dimer, LDH, CRP, and E. faecalis. CONCLUSION: Gut microbiota dysbiosis correlates with abnormal immune response in moderate COVID-19 patients with fever.","Zhou, Yaya; Shi, Xing; Fu, Wei; Xiang, Fei; He, Xinliang; Yang, Bohan; Wang, Xiaorong; Ma, Wan-Li",J Inflamm Res,64,3

To explore the type of PD activities English teachers in Iran participate in and also to understand the motivations behind their participation, the researchers interviewed 24 English teachers (with the age range of 24–50) working at private language institutes and public high schools. The study found that public school teachers were engaged in very few PD activities, and the type of PD activities private teachers followed ranged from consulting online courses to watching educational videos to reading ELT textbooks. The motivations for taking part in PD activities ranged from ‘having no motivation’ to ‘promoting my English’ to ‘being able to teach at university’.

There is no vaccine or specific drug yet made as of June 19, 2020, for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Thus, the patients currently can only be treated symptomatically. A quick identification of the drugs for COVID-19 may act as a potential therapeutic medication which has been used earlier in patients to answer the present pandemic condition before it could get more worse. According to our view, an artificial intelligence (AI) based tool that may predict drugs/peptides directly from the sequences of infected patients and thereby, they might have better affinity with the target and contribute towards vaccine design against COVID-19.

It allows for the patient’s urological health to be managed and their renal function to be preserved, and it promotes autonomy. Compliance with the prescribed number of daily catheterizations, which must be conducted by the patient, and infection prevention measures are crucial. To identify the patients requiring IBC, and to determine their adherence (whether they followed the prescribed guidelines and their difficulty in carrying out the procedure, as well as to assess how the IBC influences their quality of life and state of mind after receiving self-care training from a specialized nurse), we carried out a prospective, multicenter observational study in 24 Spanish hospitals with one month of monitoring and a sample of 99 patients. The sources of information were the patients’ clinical records, the King’s Health Questionnaire, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). Descriptive and bivariate statistics were used to analyses the paired data. After recruitment (n = 99), 79 patients completed the questionnaire at a mean age of 35.2 years (SD = 20.5 years).

After one month of monitoring, a statistically significant improvement in quality of life was observed in all criteria, with the exception of personal relationships (p < 0.005), as well as an improvement in anxiety and depression levels (p < 0.001). Patients who require IBC show good adherence to the IBC with a significant percentage of self-catheterization. After one month of IBC, a significant improvement in the patients’ quality of life and mood was observed. These results could be attributed to adequate patient training and adequate personalization of the IBC materials by the specialized nurses.","Blanc, Blanca Fernandez-Lasquetty; Rodríguez-Almagro, Julián; Lorenzo-García, Carlos; Alcaraz-Zomeño, Elena; Fernandez-Llorente, Guadalupe; Baixauli-Puig, Montserrat; Martín-Bermejo, María Victoria; Estudillo-González, Francisco; Ortega-Checa, Maria Angustias; Lluesma-Martinez, Vicenta; Ferrández-Franco, Guillermina; Benito-Santos, Begoña; Rodríguez-Díaz, Mónica; Torres-Bacete, Arancha; Guerrero-Andrades, María Carmen; Louis-Lauture, Mario Pierre; Jiménez-Mayorga, Isabel; Serrano-Abielar, Rosario; Garrido-Mora, María Asunción; Barcia-Barrera, Francisco; Asensio-Malo, Gemma; Morcillo-Marín, Montserrat; Tendero-Ruiz, Silvia; Hernández-Martínez, Antonio",J Clin Med,64,1

However, an increase in the number of BCG-induced tumor-specific T cells in the tumor microenvironment could lead to enhanced therapeutic effects. METHODS: Here, we have developed a novel cancer vaccine platform based on BCG that can broaden BCG-induced immune responses to include tumor antigens. By physically attaching tumor-specific peptides onto the mycobacterial outer membrane, we were able to induce strong systemic and intratumoral T cell-specific immune responses toward the attached tumor antigens. These therapeutic peptides can be efficiently attached to the mycobacterial outer membrane using a poly-lysine sequence N-terminally fused to the tumor-specific peptides. RESULTS: Using two mouse models of melanoma and a mouse model of colorectal cancer, we observed that the antitumor immune responses of BCG could be improved by coating the BCG with tumor-specific peptides. In addition, by combining this novel cancer vaccine platform with anti-programmed death 1 (anti-PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, the number of responders to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy was markedly increased. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that intratumoral BCG immunotherapy can be improved by coating the bacteria with modified tumor-specific peptides. In addition, this improved BCG immunotherapy can be combined with ICI therapy to obtain enhanced tumor growth control.

Neutral electrolyzed saline solution that contains reactive chlorine and oxygen species may be an effective therapeutic. In the present study, the treatment efficacy of intravenous and/or nebulized neutral electrolyzed saline combined with usual medical care vs. usual medical care alone was evaluated in ambulatory patients with COVID-19. A prospective, 2-arm, parallel-group, randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase I-II clinical trial including 214 patients was performed. The following two outcomes were evaluated during the 20-day follow-up: i) The number of patients with disease progression; and ii) the patient acceptable symptom state. Serial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 naso/oro-pharyngeal detection by reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q) PCR was performed in certain patients of the experimental group. Biochemical and hematologic parameters, as well as adverse effects, were also evaluated in the experimental group. The experimental treatment decreased the risk of hospitalization by 89% [adjusted relative risk (RR)=0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03-0.37, P<0.001] and the risk of death by 96% (adjusted RR=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01-0.42, P=0.007) and also resulted in an 18-fold higher probability of achieving an acceptable symptom state on day 5 (adjusted RR=18.14, 95% CI: 7.29-45.09, P<0.001), compared with usual medical care alone. Overall, neutral electrolyzed saline solution was better than usual medical care alone. Of the patients analyzed, >50% were negative for the virus as detected by RT-qPCR in naso/oro-pharyngeal samples on day 4, with only a small number of positive patients on day 6. Clinical improvement correlated with a decrease in C-reactive protein, aberrant monocytes and increased lymphocytes and platelets. Cortisol and testosterone levels were also evaluated and a decrease in cortisol levels and an increase in the testosterone-cortisol ratio were observed on days 2 and 4. The experimental treatment produced no serious adverse effects.

ACE2 is highly expressed in adipose tissue (AT), rendering AT a potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir contributing to massive viral spread in COVID-19 patients with obesity. Although rodent and cell studies suggest that the polyphenol resveratrol alters ACE2, human studies are lacking. Here, we investigated the effects of 30-days resveratrol supplementation on RAS components in AT and skeletal muscle in men with obesity in a placebo-controlled cross-over study. Resveratrol markedly decreased ACE2 (~40%) and leptin (~30%), but did neither alter angiotensinogen, ACE and AT1R expression in AT nor skeletal muscle RAS components. These findings demonstrate that resveratrol supplementation reduces ACE2 in AT, which might dampen SARS-CoV-2 spread in COVID-19.","de Ligt, Marlies; Hesselink, Matthijs K.

In answering questions raised regarding our study, we updated our database and repeated all analyses. Methods We re-evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and/or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICUs of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital from ICU admission to death, ICU discharge or April 22nd 2020, whichever came first. Results We studied the same 184 ICU patients as reported on previously, of whom a total of 41 died (22%) and 78 were discharged alive (43%). The median follow-up duration increased from 7 to 14 days. All patients received pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome, adjusted for competing risk of death, was 49% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41–57%). The majority of thrombotic events were PE (65/75; 87%). In the competing risk model, chronic anticoagulation therapy at admission was associated with a lower risk of the composite outcome (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.29, 95%CI 0.091–0.92). Patients diagnosed with thrombotic complications were at higher risk of all-cause death (HR 5.4; 95%CI 2.4–12). Use of therapeutic anticoagulation was not associated with all-cause death (HR 0.79, 95%CI 0.35–1.8). Conclusion In this updated analysis, we confirm the very high cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Klok, F.

Non-pharmacological interventions could be provided to potentially improve mental and physical health outcomes. However, the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions on health and well-being among individuals with SSc has not been well established. The proposed living systematic review aims to identify and evaluate randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence on the effectiveness of non-pharmacological and non-surgical interventions on mental and physical health outcomes and on the delivery of such services in SSc. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Eligible studies will be RCTs that examine non-pharmacological and non-surgical interventions aimed at improving health outcomes among individuals with SSc or the delivery of services intended to improve healthcare or support of people with SSc (eg, support groups). All RCTs included in a previous systematic review that sought studies published between 1990 and March 2014 will be evaluated for inclusion. Additional trials will be sought from January 2014 onwards using a similar, augmented search strategy developed by a health sciences librarian. We will search the MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases and will not restrict by language. Two independent reviewers will determine the eligibility of identified RCTs and will extract data using a prespecified standardised form in DistillerSR.

In a race to contain the infection, researchers and healthcare officials have developed several assays to help diagnose individuals with COVID-19. To help laboratories in deciding what assay to bring into testing lines, factors such as assay availability, cost, throughput, and TAT should be considered. Here we validated a modified version of the CDC assay and used it as a reference to evaluate the performance of the NeuMoDx™ SARS-CoV-2 and DiaSorin Simplexa™ Covid-19 Direct assays. In silico analysis and clinical sample testing showed that the primesr/probes designed by the CDC were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 as they accurately detected all reactive samples with an assay LoD of 200 copies/ml. The performance of the three assays were analyzed using 161 nasopharyngeal swabs specimen tested within 24 hours or 5 days from routine testing. A 100% agreement was observed between the commercial assays and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. A deeper look at the Ct values showed no significant difference between NeuMoDx and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, whereas DiaSorin had lower overall Ct values than the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. NeuMoDx and DiaSorin workflows were much easier to perform. NeuMoDx has the highest throughput and shortest TAT, whereas although the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay has comparable throughput to DiaSorin, it has the longest hands-on time, and highest TAT.","Lima, Amorce; Healer, Vicki; Vendrone, Elaine; Silbert, Suzane",bioRxiv,64,3

We evaluated the role of chloroquine and its derivatives in COVID-19 in Spanish individuals. METHODS: We performed a survey addressed to patients regularly taking chloroquine and its derivatives for the control of their autoimmune diseases. The survey was distributed with special attention to Spanish patient associations centred on autoimmune diseases and rheumatology and to the general population. A sample of untreated subjects was matched to the treated group according to sex, age range and incidence region. COVID-19 disease prevalence was compared between treated and untreated-matched control sample. RESULTS: A total of 319 surveys of patients regularly taking chloroquine and its derivatives were recovered for further analysis. The prevalence of declared COVID-19 status in the treated group was 5.3% and the mean prevalence among the untreated-matched groups was 3.4%. A community exposition to COVID-19 was associated with a greater prevalence of COVID-19 in both, treated (17.0% vs. 3.2%; p-value<0.001) and untreated groups (13.4% vs. 1.1%; p-value = 0.027). CONCLUSION: We did not find differences of reported COVID-19 cases between treated and untreated groups, indicating a lack of protection by regular administration of chloroquine and its derivative drugs on COVID-19 infection. Of relevance, data indicates that patients that regularly take chloroquine derivatives are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection and must take the same protection measures as the general population.","Laplana, Marina; Yuguero, Oriol; Fibla, Joan",PLoS One,64,26

However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of coronavirus replication by CsA is unknown. In this study, we analysed the role of Cyps in FCoV replication using knockdown and knockout cells specific to Cyps. Inhibition of CypA and CypB reduced FCoV replication, with replication in knockout cells being much less than that in knockdown cells. Furthermore, the proteins expressed by CypA and CypB harbouring mutations in their respective predicted peptidyl-prolyl cis–transisomerase active sites, which also alter the affinities between Cyps and CsA, inhibited FCoV replication. These findings indicate that the peptidyl-prolyl cis–transisomerase active sites of Cyps might be required for FCoV replication.","Tanaka, Yoshikazu; Sato, Yuka; Sasaki, Takashi",Journal of General Virology,64,21

Burden of disease estimates for COVID-19 have not been calculated for the Australian population. Burden of disease data on COVID-19 provide valuable information on the impact of the disease, including both fatal and non-fatal effects. METHODS: Burden of disease is measured using the summary measure disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). One DALY is 1 year of ‘healthy life’ lost due to illness (Years Lived with Disability) and/or death (Years of Life Lost)—the more DALYs associated with a disease or injury, the greater the burden. The analysis draws on Australian deaths, incidence and severity, as well as methods and other inputs developed in other countries reflecting current understanding about this new disease. RESULTS: There were over 8,300 DALYs lost due to COVID-19 in 2020 in Australia; 97% of the disease burden arose from fatal cases. Males lost an average of 10.7 years, and females 8.1 years, due to dying from COVID-19, using an aspirational life expectancy. The burden of disease estimates for Australia for COVID-19 are much lower than the leading diseases causing burden. CONCLUSIONS: The relatively low burden for COVID-19 in Australia in 2020 compared to other diseases and other countries reflects the success Australia had in containing the virus. KEY MESSAGES: Most of the burden due to COVID-19 in Australia was fatal. Burden of disease estimates for COVID-19 in Australia for 2020 are much lower than the leading diseases.","Moon, Lynelle; Reynolds, Anna; Gourley, Michelle",Int J Epidemiol,64,17

Moderation analysis provides a statistical approach to examine for whom and under what conditions interventions are most effective. Conducted within a parent project, which investigated the effects of an inferential reading comprehension intervention, the current study examined factors related to the deployment of students’ attention as well as language status that might be associated with differential response to intervention. Sixty-six struggling middle school readers were randomly assigned to a computerized version of the intervention, a teacher-led version, or business-as-usual (BaU) control instruction. The influence of language status (i.e., English Learner status) and pre-intervention levels of mind-wandering, anxiety, and mindset on the effects of the inferential reading comprehension intervention were examined. There were no moderator effects for the teacher-led group compared to the BaU control. Conversely, anxiety, mind-wandering, and language status moderated the effects of the computer-led intervention for some reading and inference-making outcomes. The computer-led intervention was associated with improved inference-making for students with higher levels of self-reported anxiety and mind-wandering. In contrast, the computer-led intervention was less beneficial than BaU instruction for English learners. Findings are discussed with respect to how these factors might be relevant for interpreting the effects of interventions for struggling middle school readers in general, and for English learners in particular. The findings also point to the importance of considering the characteristics of both student and instructional features in the creation and testing of reading comprehension interventions.","Martinez-Lincoln, Amanda; Barnes, Marcia A.; Clemens, Nathan H.",Ann Dyslexia,64,1

Study participant records from various sources are linked together and to patient records when possible to address research questions while ensuring patient privacy. This paper presents a novel tool that pseudonymizes participant identifiers (PIDs) using a researcher-driven automated process that takes advantage of application-programming interface (API) and the Perl Open-Source Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine Archive (POSDA) to further de-identify PIDs. The tool, on-demand cohort and API participant identifier pseudonymization (O-CAPP), employs a pseudonymization method based on the type of incoming research data. METHODS: For images, pseudonymization of PIDs is done using API calls that receive PIDs present in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) headers and returns the pseudonymized identifiers. For non-imaging clinical research data, PIDs provided by study principal investigators (PIs) are pseudonymized using a nightly automated process. The pseudonymized PIDs (P-PIDs) along with other protected health information is further de-identified using POSDA. RESULTS: A sample of 250 PIDs pseudonymized by O-CAPP were selected and successfully validated. Of those, 125 PIDs that were pseudonymized by the nightly automated process were validated by multiple clinical trial investigators (CTIs). For the other 125, CTIs validated radiologic image pseudonymization by API request based on the provided PID and P-PID mappings. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel approach of an on-demand pseudonymization process that will aide researchers in obtaining a comprehensive and holistic view of study participant data without compromising patient privacy.","Syed, Shorabuddin; Syed, Mahanazuddin; Syeda, Hafsa Bareen; Garza, Maryam; Bennett, William; Bona, Jonathan; Begum, Salma; Baghal, Ahmad; Zozus, Meredith; Prior, Fred",Healthc Inform Res,64,16

Thus, there is an urgent need to identify early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to determine the risk of developing serious illness. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 114 patients with COVID-19 at the Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan based on their clinical and laboratory data. Patients were categorized into severe and mild to moderate disease groups. We analyzed the potential of serological inflammation indicators in predicting the severity of COVID-19 in patients using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic curves, and nomogram analysis. The Spearman method was used to understand the correlation between the serological biomarkers and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS: Patients with severe disease had reduced neutrophils and lymphocytes; severe coagulation dysfunction; altered content of biochemical factors (such as urea, lactate dehydrogenase); elevated high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, neutrophil-lymphocyte, platelet-lymphocyte, and derived neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios, high sensitivity C-reactive protein-prealbumin ratio (HsCPAR), systemic immune-inflammation index, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein-albumin ratio (HsCAR); and low lymphocyte-monocyte ratio, prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and albumin-to-fibrinogen ratio. PNI, HsCAR, and HsCPAR correlated with the risk of severe disease. The nomogram combining the three parameters showed good discrimination with a C-index of 0.873 and reliable calibration. Moreover, HsCAR and HsCPAR correlated with duration of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Taken together, PNI, HsCAR, and HsCPAR may serve as accurate biomarkers for the prediction of disease severity in patients with COVID-19 upon admission/hospitalization.","Xue, Guohui; Gan, Xing; Wu, Zhiqiang; Xie, Dan; Xiong, Yan; Hua, Lin; Zhou, Bing; Zhou, Nanjin; Xiang, Jie; Li, Junming",Int Immunopharmacol,64,20

Multilobar infiltrate with a reticulonodular pattern is evident on chest CT scan. Brain CT scan with pituitary macroadenoma apoplexy was shown. SARS-Cov2 was confirmed, and respiratory support initiated. However, the patient died shortly afterward, secondary to pulmonary complications. CONCLUSION: The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II receptor is expressed in circumventricular organs and in cerebrovascular endothelial cells, which play a role in vascular autoregulation and cerebral blood flow. For this reason, is rational the hypothesize that brain ACE II could be involved in COVID-19 infection.

The pneumonia was treated symptomatically, but 16 days later the cat was presented again. Since the owner had been tested positive for a SARS-CoV-2 infection in the meantime, swab samples were taken from the cat and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleic acids. The various RT-qPCR analyses and whole-genome sequencing revealed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant in this cat. This study shows that pets living in close contact with SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 infected owners can contract this virus and also suffer from a respiratory disease. It is not clear yet whether onward transmissions to other cats and humans can occur. To minimize transmission risks, pet owners and veterinarians should comply to the hygienic rules published by OIE and others. It must be stated, that infections of cats with SARS-CoV-2 is still a rare event. Cats with clinical signs of a respiratory disease should be presented to a veterinarian, who will decide on further steps.","Keller, Markus; Hagag, Ibrahim T; Balzer, Jörg; Beyer, Katja; Kersebohm, Johanna C; Sadeghi, Balal; Wernike, Kerstin; Höper, Dirk; Wylezich, Claudia; Beer, Martin; Groschup, Martin H",Res Vet Sci,64,20

OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis summarized contemporary studies that report the use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) to treat COVID-19. SEARCH STRATEGY: Six electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Wanfang Data and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched from their beginning to May 15, 2020 with the following search terms: traditional Chinese medicine, Chinese medicine, Chinese herbal medicine, COVID-19, new coronavirus pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2, and randomized controlled trial. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from peer-reviewed journals and non-reviewed publications were included. Further, included RCTs had a control group that was given standard care (SC; such as conventional Western medicine treatments or routine medical care), and a treatment group that was given SC plus CHM. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two evaluators screened and collected literature independently; information on participants, study design, interventions, follow-up and adverse events were extracted, and risk of bias was assessed. The primary outcomes included scores that represented changes in symptoms and signs over the course of treatment. Secondary outcomes included the level of inflammatory markers, improvement of pneumonia confirmed by computed tomography (CT), and adverse events. Dichotomous data were expressed as risk ratio or hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI); where time-to-event analysis was used, outcomes were expressed as odds ratio with 95% CI. Continuous data were expressed as difference in means (MD) with 95% CI, and standardized mean difference (SMD) was used when different outcome scales were pooled. RESULTS: Seven original studies, comprising a total of 732 adults, were included in this meta-analysis. Compared to SC alone, CHM plus SC had a superior effect on the change of symptom and sign score (−1.30 by SMD, 95% CI [−2.43, −0.16]; 3 studies; n = 261, P = 0.03), on inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP, mg/L; −11.82 by MD, 95% CI [−17.95, −5.69]; 5 studies; n = 325, P = 0.0002), on number of patients with improved lung CT scans (1.34 by risk ratio, 95% CI [1.19, 1.51]; 4 studies; n = 489, P < 0.00001). No significant adverse events were recorded in the included RCTs. CONCLUSION: Current evidence shows that CHM, as an adjunct treatment with standard care, helps to improve treatment outcomes in COVID-19 cases.","Fan, Arthur Yin; Gu, Sherman; Alemi, Sarah Faggert",J Integr Med,64,16

Recently, the coronavirus papain-like proteases (PLPs) have been identified as suppressors of the innate immune response. However, the molecular mechanism of this inhibition remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that PLP2, a catalytic domain of the nonstructural protein 3 of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), deubiquitinates and stabilizes the cellular oncoprotein MDM2 and induces the proteasomal degradation of p53. Meanwhile, we identify IRF7 (interferon regulatory factor 7) as a bona fide target gene of p53 to mediate the p53-directed production of type I interferon and the innate immune response. By promoting p53 degradation, PLP2 inhibits the p53-mediated antiviral response and apoptosis to ensure viral growth in infected cells. Thus, our study reveals that coronavirus engages PLPs to escape from the innate antiviral response of the host by inhibiting p53-IRF7-IFNβ signaling.","Yuan, Lin; Chen, Zhongbin; Song, Shanshan; Wang, Shan; Tian, Chunyan; Xing, Guichun; Chen, Xiaojuan; Xiao, Zhi-Xiong; He, Fuchu; Zhang, Lingqiang",J Biol Chem,64,1

To identify ahead of time those who are at risk of developing severe diseases and potentially in need of intensive care, we investigated the independent associations between longitudinal glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), the impact of common medications (metformin, insulin, ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and corticosteroids) and COVID-19 severity in people with T2D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study was conducted using deidentified claims and electronic health record data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse across the USA between January 2017 and November 2020, including 16 504 individuals with T2D and COVID-19. A univariate model and a multivariate model were applied to evaluate the association between 2 and 3-year HbA1c average, medication use between COVID-19 diagnosis and intensive care unit admission (if applicable), and risk of intensive care related to COVID-19. RESULTS: With covariates adjusted, the HR of longitudinal HbA1c for risk of intensive care was 1.12 (per 1% increase, p<0.001) and 1.48 (comparing group with poor (HbA1c ≥9%) and adequate glycemic control (HbA1c 6%–9%), p<0.001). The use of corticosteroids and the combined use of insulin and metformin were associated with significant reduction of intensive care risk, while ACEIs and ARBs were not associated with reduced risk of intensive care. CONCLUSIONS: Two to three-year longitudinal glycemic level is independently associated with COVID-19-related severity in people with T2D. Here, we present a potential method to use HbA1c history, which presented a stronger association with COVID-19 severity than single-point HbA1c, to identify in advance those more at risk of intensive care due to COVID-19 in the T2D population. The combined use of metformin and insulin and the use of corticosteroids might be significant to prevent patients with T2D from becoming critically ill from COVID-19.","Wang, Bowen; Glicksberg, Benjamin S; Nadkarni, Girish N; Vashishth, Deepak",BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care,64,20

A virulent PEDV YN13 strain, isolated in our laboratory, was attenuated to yield an attenuated PEDV strain YN144. To better understand the pathogenesis mechanism and the virus-host interaction during infection with both PEDV YN13 and YN144 strains, a comparative proteomic analysis was carried out to investigate the proteomic changes produced in the primary target organ, using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling, followed by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A total of 269 and 301 differently expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the jejunum tissues of the piglets inoculated with YN13 and YN144, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these proteins were involved in stress responses, signal transduction, and the immune system. All of these involved interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) which were up-regulated in jejunums by both of the PEDV-infected groups. Based on the comparative analysis, we proposed that different changes induced by YN13 and YN144 in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1), eukaryotic initiation factor 4G1 (eIF4G1), and some members in the heat shock protein (HSP) family, may be responsible for differences in their pathogenicity.","Li, Zhonghua; Chen, Fangzhou; Ye, Shiyi; Guo, Xiaozhen; Muhanmmad Memon, Atta; Wu, Meizhou; He, Qigai",Viruses,64,5

Here, MERS-CoV prevalence was compared in imported African camels and their local counterparts. A total of 1399 paired sera and nasal swabs were collected from camels between 2016 and 2018. Imported animals from Sudan (n = 829) and Djibouti (n = 328) were sampled on incoming ships at Jeddah Islamic seaport before unloading, and local camels were sampled from Jeddah (n = 242). Samples were screened for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and MERS-CoV viral RNA. The overall seroprevalence was 92.7% and RNA detection rate was 17.2%. Imported camels had higher seroprevalence compared to resident herds (93.8% vs 87.6%, p <0.01) in contrast to RNA detection (13.3% vs 35.5%, p <0.0001). Seroprevalence significantly increased with age (p<0.0001) and viral RNA detection rate was ~2-folds higher in camels <2-year-old compared to older animals. RNA detection was higher in males verses females (24.3% vs 12.6%, p<0.0001) but seroprevalence was similar. Concurrent positivity for viral RNA and nAbs was found in >87% of the RNA positive animals, increased with age and was sex-dependent. Importantly, reduced viral RNA load was positively correlated with nAb titers.

In this regard, growing evidence is focusing on COVID-19 neurological associations; however, there is a lack of established pathophysiological mechanisms and related treatments. Accordingly, a comprehensive review was conducted, using electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane, along with the author’s expertize in COVID-19 associated neuronal signaling pathways. Besides, potential phytochemicals have been provided against neurological signs of COVID-19. Considering a high homology among SARS-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and SARS-CoV-2, revealing their precise pathophysiological mechanisms seems to pave the road for the treatment of COVID-19 neural manifestations. There is a complex pathophysiological mechanism behind central manifestations of COVID-19, including pain, hypo/anosmia, delirium, impaired consciousness, pyramidal signs, and ischemic stroke. Among those dysregulated neuronal mechanisms, neuroinflammation, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/spike proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and protease are of special attention. So, employing multi-target therapeutic agents with considerable safety and efficacy seems to show a bright future in fighting COVID-19 neurological manifestations. Nowadays, natural secondary metabolites are highlighted as potential multi-target phytochemicals in combating several complications of COVID-19.

Viroporins participate in multiple steps of the viral life cycle, from entry to budding. As any other membrane protein, viroporins have to find the way to bury their hydrophobic regions into the lipid bilayer. Once within the membrane, the hydrophobic helices of viroporins interact with each other to form higher ordered structures required to correctly perform their porating activities. This two-step process resembles the two-stage model proposed for membrane protein folding by Engelman and Poppot. In this review we use the membrane protein folding model as a leading thread to analyze the mechanism and forces behind the membrane insertion and folding of viroporins. We start by describing the transmembrane segment architecture of viroporins, including the number and sequence characteristics of their membrane-spanning domains. Next, we connect the differences found among viroporin families to their viral genome organization, and finalize focusing on the pathways used by viroporins in their way to the membrane and on the transmembrane helix-helix interactions required to achieve proper folding and assembly.","Martinez-Gil, Luis; Mingarro, Ismael",Viruses,64,20

In the present study, a novel EV‐G strain (KOR/KNU‐1811/2018) that resulted from cross‐order recombination was discovered in diagnostic faecal samples from neonatal pigs with diarrhoea that were negative for swine enteric coronaviruses and rotavirus. The recombinant EV‐G genome possessed an exogenous 594‐nucleotide (198‐amino acid) sequence, flanked by two viral 3C(pro) cleavage sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends in its 2C/3A junction region. This insertion encoded a predicted protease similar to the porcine torovirus papain‐like cysteine protease (PLCP), which was recently found in the EV‐G1, ‐G2, and ‐G17 genomes. The complete KNU‐1811 genome shared 73.7% nucleotide identity with a prototype EV‐G1 strain, but had 83.9%–86.7% sequence homology with the global EV‐G1‐PLCP strains. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the Korean recombinant EV‐G's own VP1 and inserted foreign PLCP genes are most closely related independently to contemporary chimeric G1‐PLCP and G17‐PLCP strains respectively. These results implied that the torovirus‐derived PLCP gene might have undergone continuous nucleotide mutations in the respective EV‐G genome following its independent acquisition through naturally occurring recombination. Our results advance the understanding of the genetic evolution of EV‐G driven by infrequent viral recombination events, by which EV‐G populations laterally gain an exotic gene encoding a virulence factor from heterogeneous virus families, thereby causing clinical disease in swine.","Lee, Sunhee; Lee, Changhee",Transbound Emerg Dis,64,16

These services will need to be modified in order to minimize COVID-19 transmission and ensure the safety of health workers and the community. Additional budget will be required to implement these modifications that ensure safe delivery. METHODS: Using a simple modeling analysis, we estimated the additional resource requirements associated with modifications to supplementary immunization activities (campaigns) and routine immunization services via fixed sites and outreach in 2020 US dollars. We considered the following four categories of costs: (1) personal protective equipment (PPE) & infection prevention and control (IPC) measures for immunization sessions; (2) physical distancing and screening during immunization sessions; (3) delivery strategy changes, such as changes in session sizes and frequency or hazard pay to compensate health workers; and (4) other operational cost increases, including additional social mobilization, communication, training, and transport. RESULTS: We found that implementing a range of measures to protect health workers and communities from COVID-19 transmission could result in a per-facility start-up cost of $466–799 for routine fixed-site delivery and $12–220 for routine outreach delivery, and $12–108 per immunization campaign site. A recurrent monthly cost of $137–1,024 for fixed-site delivery and $152–848 for outreach delivery per facility could be incurred, and a $0.32–0.85 increase in the cost per dose during campaigns. CONCLUSIONS: By illustrating potential cost implications of providing immunization services through a range of strategies in a safe manner, these estimates can provide a benchmark for program managers and policy makers on the additional budget required. These findings can help country practitioners and global development partners planning the continuation of immunization services in the context of COVID-19.","Banks, Christina; Portnoy, Allison; Moi, Flavia; Boonstoppel, Laura; Brenzel, Logan; Resch, Stephen C.",Vaccine,64,13

In this multivariate analysis, older age (adjusted OR 1.07 (95% CI 1.02-1.11), p=0.004), lower Hb level (adjusted OR 0.78 (95% CI 0.60-0.98), p=0.035), duration of AKI (adjusted OR 7.34 for persistent AKI (95% CI 2.37-22.72), p=0.001) and severity of AKI (adjusted OR 2.65 per increase in KDIGO stage (95% CI 1.32-5.33), p=0.006) were independent predictors of mortality. Conclusion: AKI was frequent in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Persistent AKI and higher severity of AKI were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.","Gameiro, Joana; Agapito Fonseca, José; Oliveira, João; Marques, Filipe; Bernardo, João; Costa, Claudia; Carreiro, Carolina; Braz, Sandra; António Lopes, José",Nefrologia,64,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients underwent both follow-up chest CT and MRI scans, evaluated for ground-glass opacities (GGOs), consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, fibrosis, pleural indentation, vessel enlargement, bronchiolar ectasia, and changes compared to prior CT scans. DWI/ADC was evaluated for signal abnormalities suspicious for inflammation. Agreement between CT and MRI was assessed with Cohen’s k and weighted k. Measures of diagnostic accuracy of MRI were calculated. RESULTS: The agreement between CT and MRI was almost perfect for consolidation (k = 1.00) and change from prior CT (k = 0.857); substantial for predominant pattern (k = 0.764) and interlobular septal thickening (k = 0.734); and poor for GGOs (k = 0.339), fibrosis (k = 0.224), pleural indentation (k = 0.231), and vessel enlargement (k = 0.339). Meanwhile, the sensitivity of MRI was high for GGOs (1.00), interlobular septal thickening (1.00), and consolidation (1.00) but poor for fibrotic changes (0.18), pleural indentation (0.23), and vessel enlargement (0.50) and the specificity was overall high. DWI was positive in 46.0% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The agreement between MRI and CT was overall good. MRI was very sensitive for GGOs, consolidation and interlobular septal thickening and overall specific for most findings. DWI could be a reputable imaging biomarker of inflammatory activity.","Pecoraro, Martina; Cipollari, Stefano; Marchitelli, Livia; Messina, Emanuele; Del Monte, Maurizio; Galea, Nicola; Ciardi, Maria Rosa; Francone, Marco; Catalano, Carlo; Panebianco, Valeria",Radiol Med,64,20

Here we analyse an extended SEIR model that accounts for asymptomatic carriers, believed to play an important role in COVID-19 transmission. For this model we derive a number of analytic results for important quantities such as the peak number of infections, the time taken to reach the peak and the size of the final affected population. We also propose an accurate way of specifying initial conditions for the numerics (from insufficient data) using the fact that the early time exponential growth is well-described by the dominant eigenvector of the linearized equations. Secondly we explore the effect of different intervention strategies such as social distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try to reduce the disease reproductive number, [Formula: see text] to a target value [Formula: see text] but in distinct ways, which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same [Formula: see text] TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than SD. However, for TQ to be effective, it has to be based on contact tracing and our study quantifies the required ratio of tests-per-day to the number of new cases-per-day. Our analysis shows that the largest eigenvalue of the linearised dynamics provides a simple understanding of the disease progression, both pre- and post- intervention, and explains observed data for many countries. We apply our results to the COVID data for India to obtain heuristic projections for the course of the pandemic, and note that the predictions strongly depend on the assumed fraction of asymptomatic carriers.","Das, Arghya; Dhar, Abhishek; Goyal, Srashti; Kundu, Anupam; Pandey, Saurav",Chaos Solitons Fractals,64,1

Although it is impossible to accurately calculate the actual environmental impact of the new biochemical synthesis technology, it becomes apparent that transport accounts for up to 99% of the total carbon footprint. The emissions for air freight, road transportation and last-mile delivery are nearly as 19 times the emissions generated from ultra-deep freeze technologies, the production of dry ice, glass and medical polymers for packaging. The carbon footprint of a single mRNA vaccine dose injected into a patient is about 0.01 to 0.2 kg CO(2) equivalents, depending on the cooling technology and the logistic routes to the vaccination sites in Germany.","Kurzweil, Peter; Müller, Alfred; Wahler, Steffen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,64,22

Although the initial interaction of JCV with host cells occurs through direct binding of the major viral capsid protein (VP1) with cell-surface molecules possessing sialic acid, these molecules have not yet been identified. In order to isolate monoclonal antibodies which inhibit attachment of JCV, we established an immunoscreening system using virus-like particles consisting of the VP1. Using this system, among monoclonal antibodies against the cell membrane fraction from JCV-permissive human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells, we isolated a monoclonal antibody designated as 24D2 that specifically inhibited attachment and infection of JCV to IMR-32 cells. The antibody 24D2 recognized a single molecule of around 60 kDa in molecular weight in the IMR-32 membrane fraction. Immunohistochemical staining with 24D2 demonstrated immunoreactivity in the cell membrane of JCV-permissive cell lines and glial cells of the human brain. These results suggested that the molecule recognized by 24D2 plays a role in JCV infection, and that it might participate as a receptor or a co-receptor in JCV attachment and entry into the cells.","Henmi, Chizuka; Sawa, Hirofumi; Iwata, Hiroshi; Orba, Yasuko; Tanaka, Shinya; Nagashima, Kazuo",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,64,17

Mitigation strategies include personal protective measures (e.g., handwashing, cough etiquette, and face coverings) that persons can use at home or while in community settings; social distancing (e.g., maintaining physical distance between persons in community settings and staying at home); and environmental surface cleaning at home and in community settings, such as schools or workplaces. Actions such as social distancing are especially critical when medical countermeasures such as vaccines or therapeutics are not available. Although voluntary adoption of social distancing by the public and community organizations is possible, public policy can enhance implementation. The CDC Community Mitigation Framework (1) recommends a phased approach to implementation at the community level, as evidence of community spread of disease increases or begins to decrease and according to severity.

DESIGN: Single centre cohort study. SETTING: Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei province, China. POPULATION: We studied 13 SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected pregnant women diagnosed between 31 January and 9 March 2020. METHODS: We collected clinical data, vaginal secretions, stool specimens and breast milk from SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected women during different stages of pregnancy and collected neonatal throat and anal swabs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We assessed viral presence in different biosamples. RESULTS: Of the 13 women with COVID‐19, five were in their first trimester, three in their second trimester and five in their third trimester. Of the five women in their third trimester who gave birth, all delivered live newborns. Among these five deliveries, the primary adverse perinatal outcomes included premature delivery (n = 2) and neonatal pneumonia (n = 2). One of nine stool samples was positive; all 13 vaginal secretion samples, and five throat swabs and four anal swabs collected from neonates, were negative for the novel coronavirus. However, one of three samples of breast milk was positive by viral nucleic acid testing. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series of 13 pregnant women with COVID‐19, we observed negative viral test results in vaginal secretion specimens, suggesting that a vaginal delivery may be a safe delivery option.

METHODS We exploit quasi-experimental variation, prompted by three major changes in policy, to assess whether public use of face masks elicit risk-compensation by increasing the number of close contacts or decreasing attention to distancing and hygiene measured in daily nationally representative surveys (N = 106 880). RESULTS Number of close contacts: face mask use prompted by the policy changes decrease the number of contacts in two of the three interventions. In the remaining intervention, it has no effect. Attention to hygiene: across the changes, face masks use does not affect people's attention to hygiene. Attention to distancing: in two of three interventions, face mask use increase attention to distancing. In the remaining intervention, we see a decrease in attention. CONCLUSIONS Overall, public use of face masks may occasionally elicit a narrow form of risk-compensation; specifically, reducing engagement in physical distancing. However, such narrow forms of risk-compensation are limited: the results do not reveal any effects on the actual number of physical contacts, only on the psychological attention to distancing advice. Moreover, the negative effect only appears for one of three interventions. The other two interventions suggest that face mask use increases attention to physical distancing.","Jørgensen, Frederik; Lindholt, Marie Fly; Bor, Alexander; Petersen, Michael Bang",European journal of public health,64,15

In this review, we summarize the knowledge about MPN clinical management, including cytoreductive and antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy, thrombotic risk, prognosis, and vaccination strategies at the time of COVID-19. ABSTRACT: An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) started in December 2019 in China and then become pandemic in February 2020. Several publications investigated the possible increased rate of COVID-19 infection in hematological malignancies. Based on the published data, strategies for the management of chronic Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are provided. The risk of severe COVID-19 seems high in MPN, particularly in patients with essential thrombocythemia, but not negligible in myelofibrosis. MPN patients are at high risk of both thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications and this must be accounted in the case of COVID-19 deciding on a case-by-case basis. There are currently no data to suggest that hydroxyurea or interferon may influence the risk or severity of COVID-19 infection. Conversely, while the immunosuppressive activity of ruxolitinib might pose increased risk of infection, its abrupt discontinuation during COVID-19 syndrome is associated with worse outcome. All MPN patients should receive vaccine against COVID-19; reassuring data are available on efficacy of mRNA vaccines in MPNs.","Palandri, Francesca; Breccia, Massimo; De Stefano, Valerio; Passamonti, Francesco",Cancers (Basel),64,16

Given the association between left atrial enlargement (LAE) and AF, we sought to evaluate the feasibility of assessing LAE on non-gated CT and its association with LVO in the hyperacute stroke setting. METHODS We analysed our prospectively collected database that included all stroke patients referred for consideration of endovascular treatment between April 14, 2020, and May 21, 2020. During this period, a CT chest was included in our regional stroke protocol to aid triage of patients suspected for COVID-19 from which cardiac measurements were obtained. Patients were dichotomized into LVO and no-LVO groups, and LA measurements were trichotomized into normal, borderline, and enlarged. Univariate analyses were performed between groups. RESULTS Of the included 38 patients, 21 were categorized as LVO and 17 as no LVO. There was a statistically significant association between LAE and LVO (p = 0.028). No significant difference was demonstrated between groups for the baseline AF and other clinical characteristics, except for baseline NIHSS (p = 0.0005). There was excellent inter- and intra-rater reliability (ICC = 0.969) for LA measurements. CONCLUSION Our study provides preliminary data to suggest LAE is more prevalent in the LVO stroke subgroup at presentation and can be reliably assessed on non-gated CT in the hyperacute setting. These findings have potential implications for stratifying secondary management and may prompt a more rigorous pursuit of occult AF or other cardiac causes of stroke.","Butt, Waleed; Dhillon, Permesh Singh; Lenthall, Robert; Malik, Luqman; Izzath, Wazim; Krishnan, Kailash; George, Bindu; Pointon, Kate",Cerebrovascular diseases extra,64,26

Since the beginning of the 21st century, three highly transmissible and pathogenic coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier and caused deadly pneumonia, inflicting severe outbreaks and causing human health emergencies of inconceivable magnitude. Indeed, in the past two decades, two human coronaviruses emerged causing serious respiratory illness: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), causing more than 10,000 cumulative cases, with mortality rates of 10 % for SARS-CoV-1 and 34.4 % for MERS-CoV. More recently, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged in China and has been identified as the etiological agent of the recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. It has rapidly spread throughout the world, causing nearly 22 million cases and ∼ 770,000 deaths worldwide, with an estimated mortality rate of ∼3.6 %, hence posing serious challenges for adequate and effective prevention and treatment. Currently, with the exception of the nucleotide analogue prodrug remdesivir, and despite several efforts, there is no known specific, proven, pharmacological treatment capable of efficiently and rapidly inducing viral containment and clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as no broad-spectrum drug for other human pathogenic coronaviruses. Another confounding factor is the paucity of molecular information regarding the tendency of coronaviruses to acquire drug resistance, a gap that should be filled in order to optimize the efficacy of antiviral drugs. In this light, the present review provides a systematic update on the current knowledge of the marked global efforts towards the development of antiviral strategies aimed at coping with the infection sustained by SARS-CoV-2 and other human pathogenic coronaviruses, displaying drug resistance profiles. The attention has been focused on antiviral drugs mainly targeting viral protease, RNA polymerase and spike glycoprotein, that have been tested in vitro and/or in clinical trials as well as on promising compounds proven to be active against coronaviruses by an in silico drug repurposing approach. In this respect, novel insights on compounds, identified by structure-based virtual screening on the DrugBank database endowed by multi-targeting profile, are also reported. We specifically identified 14 promising compounds characterized by a good in silico binding affinity towards, at least, two of the four studied targets (viral and host proteins). Among which, ceftolozane and NADH showed the best multi-targeting profile, thus potentially reducing the emergence of resistant virus strains. We also focused on potentially novel pharmacological targets for the development of compounds with anti-pan coronavirus activity. Through the analysis of a large set of viral genomic sequences, the current review provides a comprehensive and specific map of conserved regions across human coronavirus proteins which are essential for virus replication and thus with no or very limited tendency to mutate. Hence, these represent key druggable targets for novel compounds against this virus family. In this respect, the identification of highly effective and innovative pharmacological strategies is of paramount importance for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the current pandemic but potentially also for future and unavoidable outbreaks of human pathogenic coronaviruses.","Artese, Anna; Svicher, Valentina; Costa, Giosuè; Salpini, Romina; Di Maio, Velia Chiara; Alkhatib, Mohammad; Ambrosio, Francesca Alessandra; Santoro, Maria Mercedes; Assaraf, Yehuda G.; Alcaro, Stefano; Ceccherini-Silberstein, Francesca",Drug Resist Updat,64,20

Compared with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest computed tomography (CT) imaging may be a significantly more trustworthy, useful, and rapid technique to classify and evaluate COVID-19, specifically in the epidemic region. Almost all hospitals have CT imaging machines; therefore, the chest CT images can be utilized for early classification of COVID-19 patients. However, the chest CT-based COVID-19 classification involves a radiology expert and considerable time, which is valuable when COVID-19 infection is growing at rapid rate. Therefore, an automated analysis of chest CT images is desirable to save the medical professionals’ precious time. In this paper, a convolutional neural networks (CNN) is used to classify the COVID-19-infected patients as infected (+ve) or not (−ve). Additionally, the initial parameters of CNN are tuned using multi-objective differential evolution (MODE). Extensive experiments are performed by considering the proposed and the competitive machine learning techniques on the chest CT images. Extensive analysis shows that the proposed model can classify the chest CT images at a good accuracy rate.","Singh, Dilbag; Kumar, Vijay; Vaishali; Kaur, Manjit",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,64,21

The data for this study were gathered from questionnaires of 363 consumers from eight farmers’ markets in seven districts of Izmir province, Turkey. To reveal the consumer profile of the farmers’ markets examined in this study, consumer segments were determined using factor and cluster analysis. Two different consumer segments—‘conventional’ and ‘conscious’—were identified in the farmers’ markets examined. ‘Conventional Consumers’ reflect typical consumer behaviours and give more importance to factors such as the location of and access to the market, quality and freshness of the products, activities at and around the market and the availability and variety of products. ‘Conscious Consumers’, in contrast, represent a group that is more sensitive about food safety. The majority of consumers (63.64%) who visited farmers’ markets were from the Conscious Consumer segment. The majority of the consumers who visit farmers’ markets are conscious consumers, requiring the strategies related to these markets to be revised. Farmers’ markets should be improved in terms of selecting vendors, food safety, physical facilities and social activities.","Adanacioglu, Hakan",PLoS One,64,1

The functions of a large number of viral ORFs are poorly understood or unknown. In order to gain more insight into functions and modes of action and interaction of the different proteins, we cloned the viral ORFeome and performed a genome-wide analysis for intraviral protein interactions and for intracellular localization. 900 pairwise interactions were tested by yeast-two-hybrid matrix analysis, and more than 65 positive non-redundant interactions, including six self interactions, were identified. About 38% of interactions were subsequently confirmed by CoIP in mammalian cells. Nsp2, nsp8 and ORF9b showed a wide range of interactions with other viral proteins. Nsp8 interacts with replicase proteins nsp2, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14, indicating a crucial role as a major player within the replication complex machinery. It was shown by others that nsp8 is essential for viral replication in vitro, whereas nsp2 is not. We show that also accessory protein ORF9b does not play a pivotal role for viral replication, as it can be deleted from the virus displaying normal plaque sizes and growth characteristics in Vero cells. However, it can be expected to be important for the virus-host interplay and for pathogenicity, due to its large number of interactions, by enhancing the global stability of the SARS proteome network, or play some unrealized role in regulating protein-protein interactions. The interactions identified provide valuable material for future studies.","von Brunn, Albrecht; Teepe, Carola; Simpson, Jeremy C.; Pepperkok, Rainer; Friedel, Caroline C.; Zimmer, Ralf; Roberts, Rhonda; Baric, Ralph; Haas, Jürgen",PLoS One,64,22

Meteorological factors alone do not predict seasonality, given substantial climate differences between countries that are subject to flu-like epidemics or COVID-19. Pollen is documented to be antiviral and allergenic, play a role in immuno-activation, and seems to create a bio-aerosol lowering the reproduction number of flu-like viruses. Therefore, we hypothesize that pollen may explain the seasonality of flu-like epidemics including COVID-19. We tested the Pollen-Flu Seasonality Theory for 2016-2020 flu-like seasons, including COVID-19, in The Netherlands with its 17 million inhabitants. We combined changes in flu-like incidence per 100K/Dutch citizens (code: ILI) with weekly pollen counts and meteorological data for the same period. Finally, a discrete, predictive model is tested using pollen and meteorological threshold values displaying inhibitory effects on flu-like incidence. We found a highly significant inverse association of r(224)= -.38 between pollen and changes in flu-like incidence corrected for incubation period, confirming our expectations for the 2019/2020 COVID-19 season. We found that our predictive model has the highest inverse correlation with changes in flu-like incidence of r(222) = -.48 (p < .001) when pollen thresholds of 610 total pollen grains/m3 per week, 120 allergenic pollen grains/m3 per week, and a solar radiation threshold of 510 J/cm2 are passed. The passing of at least the pollen thresholds, preludes the beginning and end of flu-like seasons. Solar radiation is a supportive factor, temperature makes no difference, and relative humidity associates even with flu-like incidence increases. We conclude that pollen is a predictor for the inverse seasonality of flu-like epidemics including COVID-19, and solar radiation is a co-inhibitor. The observed seasonality of COVID-19 during Spring, suggests that COVID-19 may revive in The Netherlands after week 33, the start being preceded by the relative absence of pollen, and follows standard pollen-flu seasonality patterns.","Hoogeveen, M.

We applied the latent pandemic space model to dynamic pandemic networks constructed using data of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 164 countries. We observed the ways in which pandemic risk evolves by tracing changes in the locations of countries within the pandemic space.

Although the proportion of affected patients remains to be determined, physicians are increasingly being confronted with patients reporting respiratory symptoms and impairment beyond the acute phase of COVID-19. In face of limited evidence, the Swiss Society for Pulmonology established a working group to address this area of unmet need and formulated diagnostic and treatment recommendations for the care of patients with pulmonary long COVID (LC). METHOD: The Swiss COVID Lung Study group and Swiss Society for Pulmonology (SSP) formulated 13 questions addressing the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary LC. A survey within the SSP special interest groups involved in care of LC patients was conducted in Switzerland. A CORE process/Delphi-like process was used to formulate recommendations. Forty experienced pulmonologists replied to the first survey and 22 completed the second follow-up survey. Agreement of ≥70% consensus led to formulation of a recommendation. RESULTS: The participants in the survey reached consensus and formulated a strong recommendation for regarding the following points. Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 should have a pulmonary assessment including pulmonary function tests. Symptomatic subjects affected by COVID-19, including those with mild disease, should benefit from a pulmonary follow-up. Persistent respiratory symptoms after COVID-19 should be investigated by a pulmonary follow-up including plethysmography, diffusion capacity measurement, and blood gases analysis. Individuals having suffered from COVID-19 and who present with persistent respiratory symptoms should be offered a rehabilitation. Additional questions were given moderate or weak recommendations for. The panel did not reach sufficient consensus for pharmacological therapy (e.g., therapy specifically targeting lung fibrosis) to formulate recommendations for LC drug treatment. CONCLUSION: The formulated recommendations should serve as an interim guidance to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of patients with pulmonary LC. As new evidence emerges, these recommendations may need to be adapted.","Funke-Chambour, Manuela; Bridevaux, Pierre-Olivier; Clarenbach, Christian F.; Soccal, Paola M.; Nicod, Laurent P.; von Garnier, Christophe",Respiration,64,1

METHODS: Stratified treatment decisions in a cross-location telemedical interdisciplinary case conference were assessed in this retrospective cohort study. A standardized treatment algorithm including continuous positive airway pressure and noninvasive ventilation was implemented. A locally developed COVID inflammation score (CIS) defined patients at risk for severe disease. Patients with life-threatening inflammation were offered off-label treatment with the immune modulator ruxolitinib. RESULTS: Between 4 March 2020 and 26 June 2020 COVID-19 patients (n = 196) were treated. Median patient age (70 years) and comorbidity were high in interstudy comparison. Mortality in all patients was 17.3%. However, advance care planning statements and physician directives limited treatment intensity in 50% of the deceased patients. CIS monitoring of ruxolitinib-treated high-risk patients (n = 20) on days 5, 7, and15 resulted in suppression of inflammation by 42% (15–70), 54% (15–77) and 60% (15–80). Here, mortality was 20% (4/20). Adjusted for patients with a maximum care directive including ICU, total mortality was 8.7% (17/196). CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19 pneumonia with hyperferritinemic inflammation is related to macrophage activation syndrome-like sepsis. An interdisciplinary intensive care teleconference as a quality tool for ICUs is proposed to detect patients with rare sepsis-like syndromes.","Graf La Rosée, P.; Bremer, H.-C.; La Rosée, F.; Mohm, P.; Hochhaus, A.; Gehrke, I.; Kumle, B.; Benzing, A.; Russo, S.",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,64,24

Although nasopharyngeal swabs are the most commonly utilized samples for based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) RNA detection, collecting these specimens requires healthcare workers and necessitates the use of personal protective equipment as it presents a nosocomial transmission risk. We aimed to assess the diagnostic value of saliva samples in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with confirmed Covid‐19. METHODS: We performed a cohort study to validate the use of saliva for SARS‐CoV‐2 detection in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid‐19. Saliva samples of the patients were analyzed by reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). RESULTS: In May 2020, 28 asymptomatic and 25 mildly symptomatic patients were enrolled in the study. The median age was 37 years (range 4–70). None of the patients had a fever on presentation. Among 53 patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 detected in the nasopharyngeal sample, the real‐time RT‐PCR was positive in the saliva specimens in 48 (90.56%) patients. The mean cycle threshold (CT) values for nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens (27.80 ± 3.44 and 30.64 ± 2.83, respectively) were significantly correlated between the two sample types (p = .016).

It manifested as a global pandemic in 2020 and has since claimed millions of lives. Only a few months into this pandemic, it became evident that the viral infection leads to a hypercoagulable state. Anticoagulants became a standard and important part of therapy while d-dimer became a useful test to guide the choice of the anticoagulant (therapeutic vs prophylactic Lovenox). What remains unclear is how viral pneumonia can cause hypercoagulability, especially when it leads to thrombosis in unusual sites such as the portal vein. Another important question that remains unanswered is the duration of anticoagulation after discharge in the outpatient setting. Our case report addresses both these questions with an intriguing patient who presented with abdominal pain as the chief complaint in the absence of any respiratory symptoms whatsoever.","Rehman, Abdul; Thoppil, Anoop Jose; Wallach, Sara L",Cureus,64,26

To reduce indoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between persons, CDC recommends measures including physical distancing, universal masking (the use of face masks in public places by everyone who is not fully vaccinated), and increased room ventilation (1). Ventilation systems can be supplemented with portable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaners* to reduce the number of infectious particles in the air and provide enhanced protection from transmission between persons (2); two recent reports found that HEPA air cleaners in classrooms could reduce overall aerosol particle concentrations by &#8805;80% within 30 minutes (3,4). To investigate the effectiveness of portable HEPA air cleaners and universal masking at reducing exposure to exhaled aerosol particles, the investigation team used respiratory simulators to mimic a person with COVID-19 and other, uninfected persons in a conference room. The addition of two HEPA air cleaners that met the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-recommended clean air delivery rate (CADR) (5) reduced overall exposure to simulated exhaled aerosol particles by up to 65% without universal masking. Without the HEPA air cleaners, universal masking reduced the combined mean aerosol concentration by 72%. The combination of the two HEPA air cleaners and universal masking reduced overall exposure by up to 90%. The HEPA air cleaners were most effective when they were close to the aerosol source. These findings suggest that portable HEPA air cleaners can reduce exposure to SARS-CoV-2 aerosols in indoor environments, with greater reductions in exposure occurring when used in combination with universal masking.","Lindsley, William G.; Derk, Raymond C.; Coyle, Jayme P.; Martin, Stephen B.; Mead, Kenneth R.; Blachere, Francoise M.; Beezhold, Donald H.; Brooks, John T.; Boots, Theresa; Noti, John D.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,64,9

However, limited information is available regarding the active shedding period or whether infectious virus is also shed. Here, we monitored the clinical characteristics and virological features of 38 patients with COVID-19 (long-term carriers) who recovered from the acute disease, but still shed viral RNA for over 3 months. The median carrying history of the long-term carriers was 92 days after the first admission, and the longest carrying history was 118 days. Negative-positive viral RNA-shedding fluctuations were observed. Long-term carriers were mostly elderly people with a history of mild infection. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the sputum, where high level viral RNA was found. All nine full-length genomes of samples obtained in March–April 2020 matched early viral clades circulating in January–February 2020, suggesting that these patients persistently carried SARS-CoV-2 and were not re-infected. IgM and IgG antibodies and neutralizing-antibody proﬁles were similar between long-term carriers and recovered patients with similar disease courses. In summary, although patients with COVID-19 generated neutralizing antibodies, they may still shed infectious SARS-CoV-2 for over 3 months. These data imply that patients should be monitored after discharge to control future outbreaks.","Li, Qian; Zheng, Xiao-Shuang; Shen, Xu-Rui; Si, Hao-Rui; Wang, Xi; Wang, Qi; Li, Bei; Zhang, Wei; Zhu, Yan; Jiang, Ren-Di; Zhao, Kai; Wang, Hui; Shi, Zheng-Li; Zhang, Hui-Lan; Du, Rong-Hui; Zhou, Peng",Emerging microbes & infections,64,1

Its alarmingly quick transmission to many countries across the world and a considerable percentage of morbidity and mortality made the World Health Organization recognize it as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The perceived risk of infection has led many research groups to study COVID-19 from different aspects. In this literature review, the phylogenetics and taxonomy of COVID-19 coronavirus, epidemiology, and respiratory viruses similar to COVID-19 and their mode of action are documented in an approach to understand the behavior of the current virus. Moreover, we suggest targeting the receptors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 such as ACE2 and other proteins including 3CLpro and PLpro for improving antiviral activity and immune response against COVID-19 disease. Additionally, since phytochemicals play an essential role in complementary therapies for viral infections, we summarized different bioactive natural products against the mentioned respiratory viruses with a focus on influenza A, SARS-CoV, MERS, and COVID-19.Based on current literature, 130 compounds have antiviral potential, and of these, 94 metabolites demonstrated bioactivity against coronaviruses. Interestingly, these are classified in different groups of natural products, including alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and others. Most of these compounds comprise flavonoid skeletons. Based on our survey, xanthoangelol E (88), isolated from Angelica keiskei (Miq.) Koidz showed inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV PLpro with the best IC(50) value of 1.2 μM. Additionally, hispidulin (3), quercetin (6), rutin (8), saikosaponin D (36), glycyrrhizin (47), and hesperetin (55) had remarkable antiviral potential against different viral infections. Among these compounds, quercetin (6) exhibited antiviral activities against influenza A, SARS-CoV, and COVID-19 and this seems to be a highly promising compound. In addition, our report discusses the obstacles and future perspectives to highlight the importance of developing screening programs to investigate potential natural medicines against COVID-19.","Omrani, Marzieh; Keshavarz, Mohsen; Nejad Ebrahimi, Samad; Mehrabi, Meysam; McGaw, Lyndy J.; Ali Abdalla, Muna; Mehrbod, Parvaneh",Front Pharmacol,64,24

We sought to examine cancer care providers' attitudes toward the barriers and facilitators related to the care for these patients during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: Members of the Advocacy Committee of the Cancer and Aging Research Group, along with the Association of Community Cancer Centers, developed the survey distributed to multidisciplinary healthcare providers responsible for the direct care of patients with cancer. Participants were recruited by email sent through four professional organizations' listservs, email blasts, and messages through social media. Results: Complete data was available from 274 respondents. Only 15.4% had access to written guidelines that specifically address the management of older adults with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Age was ranked fifth as the reason for postponing treatment following comorbid conditions, cancer stage, frailty, and performance status. Barriers to the transition to telehealth were found at the patient-, healthcare worker-, and institutional-levels. Providers reported increased barriers in accessing basic needs among older adults with cancer. Most respondents agreed (86.3%) that decision making about Do Not Resuscitate orders should be the result of discussion with the patient and the healthcare proxy in all situations. The top five concerns reported were related to patient safety, treatment delays, healthcare worker mental health and burnout, and personal safety for family and self.

These compounds accumulate differentially in the root, stem, and leaf; however, the molecular basis of such tissue-specific accumulation remains poorly understood. Because tissue-specific accumulation of compounds is usually associated with tissue-specific expression of the related biosynthetic enzyme genes and regulators, we aimed to clarify and compare the transcripts expressed in different tissues of P. cuspidatum in this study. RESULTS: High-throughput RNA sequencing was performed using three different tissues (the leaf, stem, and root) of P. cuspidatum. In total, 80,981 unigenes were obtained, of which 40,729 were annotated, and 21,235 differentially expressed genes were identified. Fifty-four candidate synthetase genes and 12 transcription factors associated with stilbene, flavonoid, and anthraquinone biosynthetic pathways were identified, and their expression levels in the three different tissues were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of polyketide synthase gene families revealed two novel CHS genes in P. cuspidatum. Most phenylpropanoid pathway genes were predominantly expressed in the root and stem, while methylerythritol 4-phosphate and isochorismate pathways for anthraquinone biosynthesis were dominant in the leaf. The expression patterns of synthase genes were almost in accordance with metabolite profiling in different tissues of P. cuspidatum as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography or ultraviolet spectrophotometry. All predicted transcription factors associated with regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway were expressed at lower levels in the stem than in the leaf and root, but no consistent trend in their expression was observed between the leaf and the root. CONCLUSIONS: The molecular knowledge of key genes involved in the biosynthesis of P. cuspidatum stilbenes, flavonoids, and anthraquinones is poor. This study offers some novel insights into the biosynthetic regulation of bioactive compounds in different P. cuspidatum tissues and provides valuable resources for the potential metabolic engineering of this important medicinal plant.

This systematic review sought to identify studies defining and describing ward closure in outbreak control and to determine impact of ward closure as an intervention on outbreak containment. METHODS: We searched these databases with no language restrictions: MEDLINE, 1946 to 7 July 2014; EMBASE, 1974 to 7 July 2014; CINAHL, 1937 to 8 July 2014; and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2005 to May 2014. We also searched the following: IndMED; LILACS; reference lists from retrieved articles; conference proceedings; and websites of the CDCP, the ICID, and the WHO. We included studies of patients hospitalized in acute care facilities; used ward closure as a control measure; used other control measures; and discussed control of the outbreak(s) under investigation. A component approach was used to assess study quality. RESULTS: We included 97 English and non-English observational studies. None included a controlled comparison between ward closure and other interventions. We found that ward closure was often used as part of a bundle of interventions but could not determine its direct impact separate from all the other interventions whether used in parallel or in sequence with other interventions. We also found no universal definition of ward closure which was widely accepted. CONCLUSIONS: With no published controlled studies identified, ward closure for control of outbreaks remains an intervention that is not evidence based and healthcare personnel will need to continue to balance the competing risks associated with its use, taking into consideration the nature of the outbreak, the type of pathogen and its virulence, mode of transmission, and the setting in which it occurs.

In this study, we present the preliminary results of the first clinical study with a newly developed urine foaming test (UFT). METHODS: This study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Istanbul. After obtaining the approval of the ethics committee, urine samples were taken from three groups of patients whose informed consent was obtained. The groups were created according to the COVID-19 Diagnostic Guide of Ministry of Health: A: outpatients with suspected COVID-19, B: inpatients for follow-up and treatment, C: patients treated in intensive care unit (ICU). Also, 30 healthy volunteers were included as the control group D. Urine samples taken from all groups were delivered to the laboratory. 2.5 ml urine sample was added to the test tube and shaken for 15 seconds and the level of foam formed was visually evaluated according to the color scale. Other data of the patients were obtained from the hospital information management system and the physician caring for the patient. The clinical status, PCR test results, computed tomography (CT), if any, laboratory tests, and UFT results were compared and the level of statistical significance was expressed as p≤0.05 in the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Performance characteristics, such as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of the UFT, were statistically calculated according to the RT-PCR result and/or CT. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was observed between UFT distributions of the control, outpatient, inpatient and ICU patients (p=0.0001). The results of UFT orange and red in inpatients and ICU patients were statistically significantly higher than in the control and outpatient groups. The diagnostic accuracy of UFT was detected in all group, the pooled sensitivity was 92% (95% CI: 87–95%) and specificity was 89% (95% CI: 80–98%).

Often, it is impractical to apply these recommendations to resource-restricted settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for acute respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation management in patients with severe/critical COVID-19 in LMICs. We suggest starting supplementary oxygen when SpO(2) is persistently lower than 94%. We recommend supplemental oxygen to keep SpO(2) at 88–95% and suggest higher targets in settings where continuous pulse oximetry is not available but intermittent pulse oximetry is. We suggest a trial of awake prone positioning in patients who remain hypoxemic; however, this requires close monitoring, and clear failure and escalation criteria. In places with an adequate number and trained staff, the strategy seems safe. We recommend to intubate based on signs of respiratory distress more than on refractory hypoxemia alone, and we recommend close monitoring for respiratory worsening and early intubation if worsening occurs. We recommend low–tidal volume ventilation combined with FiO(2) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) management based on a high FiO(2)/low PEEP table. We recommend against using routine recruitment maneuvers, unless as a rescue therapy in refractory hypoxemia, and we recommend using prone positioning for 12–16 hours in case of refractory hypoxemia (PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 150 mmHg, FiO(2) ≥ 0.6 and PEEP ≥ 10 cmH(2)O) in intubated patients as standard in ARDS patients. We also recommend against sharing one ventilator for multiple patients. We recommend daily assessments for readiness for weaning by a low-level pressure support and recommend against using a T-piece trial because of aerosolization risk.","Serpa Neto, Ary; Checkley, William; Sivakorn, Chaisith; Hashmi, Madiha; Papali, Alfred; Schultz, Marcus J.",Am J Trop Med Hyg,64,3

This cell clone was susceptible to HIV/SARS pseudovirus infection and the presence of a functional receptor for S protein in this cell clone was confirmed by the cell–cell fusion assay. Further studies showed the susceptibility of this cell was due to the expression of endogenous angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which was activated by inserted LTR from retroviral vector used for expression cloning.

Since then researchers worldwide have been struggling to detect the possible pathogenesis of this disease. COVID19 showed a wide range of clinical behavior from asymptomatic to severe acute respiratory disease syndrome. However, the etiology of susceptibility to severe lung injury is not yet fully understood. Angiotensin-converting enzyme1 (ACE1) convert angiotensin I into Angiotensin II that was further metabolized by ACE 2 (ACE2). The binding ACE2 receptor to SARS-CoV-2 facilitate its enter into the host cell. The interaction and imbalance between ACE1 and ACE2 play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of lung injury. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the association of ACE1 I/D polymorphism with severity of Covid-19. The study included RT-PCR confirmed 269 cases of Covid-19. All cases were genotyped for ACE1 I/D polymorphism using polymerase chain reaction and followed by statistical analysis (SPSS, version 15.0).

This systematic review aims to explore current evidence of their use/benefits for clinicians and compare their value to face-to-face (F2F) JCs. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched systematically, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Articles were included if they involved clinicians in medical/surgical populations, using an online JC assessing utility, experience and educational value. Quality assessment was undertaken using MERSQI. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included with findings synthesised into five themes: critical appraisal skills, satisfaction/value, accessibility/environment, evidence-based practice, and preference of online JC. Studies revealed high satisfaction and equivocal or increased preference of online JCs compared to F2F due to ease of access, diverse participation, and less time/cost spent travelling. Online JCs were found to be educationally valuable, aiding development of critical appraisal skills, and promoting change in practice.

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test has been described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the standard test method for the diagnosis of the disease. However, considering that the results of this test are obtained between a few hours and two days, it is very important to apply another diagnostic method as an alternative to this test. The fact that RT-PCR test kits are limited in number, the test results are obtained in a long time, and the high probability of healthcare personnel becoming infected with the disease during the test, necessitates the use of other diagnostic methods as an alternative to these test kits. In this study, a hybrid model consisting of two-dimensional (2D) curvelet transformation, chaotic salp swarm algorithm (CSSA) and deep learning technique is developed in order to determine the patient infected with coronavirus pneumonia from X-ray images. In the proposed model, 2D Curvelet transformation is applied to the images obtained from the patient's chest X-ray radiographs and a feature matrix is ​​formed using the obtained coefficients. The coefficients in the feature matrix are optimized with the help of the CSSA and COVID-19 disease is diagnosed by the EfficientNet-B0 model, which is one of the deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model can diagnose COVID-19 disease with high accuracy from chest X-ray images.","Altan, Aytaç; Karasu, Seçkin",Chaos Solitons Fractals,64,16

The in-person attendance of games varied with time and from county to county. There is currently no evidence on whether limited in-person attendance of games is associated with COVID-19 case numbers on a county-level. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether NFL and NCAA football games with limited in-person attendance were associated with increased COVID-19 cases in the counties they were held compared with a matched set of counties. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this time-series cross-sectional study, every county hosting NFL or NCAA games with in-person attendance (treated group) in 2020 and 2021 was matched with a county that that did not host a game on the corresponding day but had an identical game history for up to 14 days prior (control group). A standard matching method was used to further refine this matched set so that the treated and matched control counties had similar population size, nonpharmaceutical interventions in place, and COVID-19 trends. The association of hosting games with in-person attendance with COVID-19 cases was assessed using a difference-in-difference estimator. Data were analyzed from August 29 to December 28, 2020. EXPOSURES: Hosting NFL or NCAA games. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was estimation of new COVID-19 cases per 100 000 residents at the county level reported up to 14 days after a game among counties with NFL and NCAA games with in-person attendance. RESULTS: A total of 528 games with in-person attendance (101 NFL games [19.1%]; 427 NCAA games [80.9%]) were included. The matching algorithm returned 361 matching sets of counties. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of attendance for NFL games was 9949 (6000 to 13 797) people. The median number of attendance for NCAA games was not available, and attendance was recorded as a binary variable. The median (IQR) daily new COVID-19 cases in treatment group counties hosting games was 26.14 (10.77-50.25) cases per 100 000 residents on game day. The median (IQR) daily new COVID-19 cases in control group counties where no games were played was 24.11 (9.64-48.55) cases per 100 000 residents on game day. The treatment effect size ranged from −5.17 to 4.72, with a mean (SD) of 1.21 (2.67) cases per 100 000 residents, within the 14-day period in all counties hosting the games, and the daily treatment effect trend remained relatively steady during this period. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study did not find a consistent increase in the daily COVID-19 cases per 100 000 residents in counties where NFL and NCAA games were held with limited in-person attendance. These findings suggest that NFL and NCAA football games hosted with limited in-person attendance were not associated with substantial risk for increased local COVID-19 cases.","Toumi, Asmae; Zhao, Haoruo; Chhatwal, Jagpreet; Linas, Benjamin P.; Ayer, Turgay",JAMA Netw Open,64,26

The purpose of this scoping review was to summarize existing research on the impact of social media interventions and tools among informal caregivers of critically ill patients after patient admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: This review followed established scoping review methods, including an extensive a priori-defined search strategy implemented in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials databases to July 10, 2020. Primary research studies reporting on the use of social media by informal caregivers for critically ill patients were included. RESULTS: We identified 400 unique citations and thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Nine were interventional trials–four randomized controlled trials (RCTs)–and a majority (n = 14) were conducted (i.e., data collected) between 2013 to 2015. Communication platforms (e.g., Text Messaging, Web Camera) were the most commonly used social media tool (n = 17), followed by social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) (n = 6), and content communities (e.g., YouTube, SlideShare) (n = 5). Nine studies’ primary objective was caregiver satisfaction, followed by self-care (n = 6), and health literacy (n = 5). Nearly every study reported an outcome on usage feasibility (e.g., user attitudes, preferences, demographics) (n = 30), and twenty-three studies reported an outcome related to patient and caregiver satisfaction. Among the studies that assessed statistical significance (n = 18), 12 reported statistically significant positive effects of social media use. Overall, 16 of the 31 studies reported positive conclusions (e.g., increased knowledge, satisfaction, involvement) regarding the use of social media among informal caregivers for critically ill patients. CONCLUSIONS: Social media has potential benefits for caregivers of the critically ill. More robust and clinically relevant studies are required to identify effective social media strategies used among caregivers for the critically ill.","Cherak, Stephana J.; Rosgen, Brianna K.; Amarbayan, Mungunzul; Plotnikoff, Kara; Wollny, Krista; Stelfox, Henry T.; Fiest, Kirsten M.",PLoS One,64,16

Developing antiviral drugs is a challenge for the scientific community and pharmaceutical industry. Given the health emergency, repurposing of existing antiviral, antiinflammatory or antimalarial drugs is an attractive option for controlling SARS-CoV-2 with drugs. However, phytochemicals selected based on ethnomedicinal information as well as in vitro antiviral studies could be promising as well. Here, we summarise the phytochemicals with reported anti-CoV activity, and further analyzed them computationally to accelerate validation for drug development against SARS-CoV-2. This systematic review started from the most potent phytocompounds (IC(50) in μM) against SARS-CoV, followed by a cluster analysis to locate the most suitable lead(s). The advanced molecular docking used the crystallography structure of SARS-CoV-2-cysteine-like protease (SARS-CoV-2-3CL(pro)) as a target. In total, seventy-eight phytochemicals with anti-CoV activity against different strains in cellular assays, were selected for this computational study, and compared with two existing repurposed FDA-approved drugs: lopinavir and ritonavir.

However, the extent and nature of changes in health care utilization during the pandemic may differ by care setting. Knowledge of the impact of the pandemic on health care utilization is important to health care organizations and policy makers. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are (1) to evaluate changes in in-person health care utilization and telehealth visits during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) to assess the difference in changes in health care utilization between the pandemic year 2020 and the prepandemic year 2019. METHODS: We retrospectively assembled a cohort consisting of members of a large integrated health care organization, who were enrolled between January 6 and November 2, 2019 (prepandemic year), and between January 5 and October 31, 2020 (pandemic year). The rates of visits were calculated weekly for four settings: inpatient, emergency department (ED), outpatient, and telehealth. Using Poisson models, we assessed the impact of the pandemic on health care utilization during the early days of the pandemic and conducted difference-in-deference (DID) analyses to measure the changes in health care utilization, adjusting for the trend of health care utilization in the prepandemic year. RESULTS: In the early days of the pandemic, we observed significant reductions in inpatient, ED, and outpatient utilization (by 30.2%, 37.0%, and 80.9%, respectively). By contrast, there was a 4-fold increase in telehealth visits between weeks 8 (February 23) and 12 (March 22) in 2020. DID analyses revealed that after adjusting for prepandemic secular trends, the reductions in inpatient, ED, and outpatient visit rates in the early days of the pandemic were 1.6, 8.9, and 367.2 visits per 100 person-years (P<.001), respectively, while the increase in telehealth visits was 272.9 visits per 100 person-years (P<.001). Further analyses suggested that the increase in telehealth visits offset the reduction in outpatient visits by week 26 (June 28, 2020). CONCLUSIONS: In-person health care utilization decreased drastically during the early period of the pandemic, but there was a corresponding increase in telehealth visits during the same period. By end-June 2020, the combined outpatient and telehealth visits had recovered to prepandemic levels.","Xu, Stanley; Glenn, Sungching; Sy, Lina; Qian, Lei; Hong, Vennis; Ryan, Denison S; Jacobsen, Steven",J Med Internet Res,64,20

We investigated social behavior, endocrine profiles, and vaginal cytology of female coyotes (Canis latrans) during 4 breeding seasons, 2000–2003. Blood levels of estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and relaxin were measured, and mating behavior and changes in vaginal epithelium were documented. After aligning the data from each individual to her estimated day of ovulation, we compared pregnant coyotes with nonpregnant females and evaluated temporal relationships among hormone levels, behavior, and vaginal cytology. We found that patterns of proceptive and receptive behaviors correlated with the secretion of steroid hormones, as did vaginal epithelial cytomorphosis. In addition, although progesterone levels of pregnant and pseudopregnant coyotes were indistinguishable, prolactin demonstrated a discernible intergroup difference and relaxin was only detectable in pregnant females. Although this study included characteristics not previously published for this species, it also showed how key aspects of reproduction were correlated temporally, and emphasized the importance of an integrated perspective when addressing the reproductive biology of coyotes, or other wild species of canids.","Carlson, Debra A.; Gese, Eric M.",J Mammal,64,16

The growing problem of vaccine hesitancy may affect the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine. We examined the individual, communication and social determinants associated with vaccines uptake. METHODS: Data come from a nationwide online probability-based panel of 1012 representative adults in the United States and the survey was conducted before the vaccines were available. People under the federal poverty level and racial and ethnic minorities were oversampled. Our outcome variables of interest were likelihood of vaccinating self and likelihood of vaccinating people under one’s care (such as children) measuring behavioral intentions. Independent variables included perceptions of risk, exposure to different media for COVID-19 news, political party identification, confidence in scientists and social determinants of health. Logistic regression analysis was used to ascertain the effects of independent variables on the two outcome variables. RESULTS: The results indicated that 68 and 65% agreed to get the vaccine for themselves and people under their care, respectively. Risk perceptions (severity of and susceptibility to COVID-19) were significantly associated with vaccine uptake. People who relied on “conservative” news outlets, Republicans, and who had low confidence in scientists are least likely to vaccinate self or children. Non-Hispanic Blacks and those with least schooling were also less likely to receive vaccine for themselves or people in their care. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified race/ethnicity, risk perceptions, exposure to different media for COVID-19 news, party identification and confidence in scientists as factors that would be affecting COVID-19 vaccine uptake. The good news is that these are addressable through strategic public health communications, but a lot of work remains to be done with some urgency.","Viswanath, K.; Bekalu, Mesfin; Dhawan, Dhriti; Pinnamaneni, Ramya; Lang, Jenna; McLoud, Rachel",BMC Public Health,64,1

There is a lack of data regarding risk of postoperative COVID-19 infection in children undergoing elective surgery, and regarding the utility of pre-operative COVID-19 testing, and preoperative “cocooning” or restriction of movements. The purpose of this present study was to examine the safety of elective paediatric Otolaryngology surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to incidence of postoperative symptomatic COVID-19 infection or major respiratory complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective cohort study of paediatric patients undergoing elective Otolaryngology surgery between September and December 2020. Primary outcome measure was incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 or major respiratory complications within the 14 days after surgery. Parents of prospectively enrolled patients were contacted 14 days after surgery and enquiry made regarding development of postoperative symptoms, COVID-19 testing, or diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: 302 patients were recruited. 125 (41.4%) underwent preoperative COVID-19 RTPCR testing. 66 (21.8%) restricted movements prior to surgery. The peak 14-day COVID-19 incidence during the study was 302.9 cases per 100,000 population. No COVID-19 infections or major respiratory complications were reported in the 14 day follow up period.

Herein, we aimed to investigate the reflections of our otherwise crowded emergency services’ quietness in the period of normalisation. METHODOLOGY: Our study retrospectively investigated three groups of patients: the patients who were admitted to the emergency service in the ‘Period of Restrictions’ when the restrictions were imposed to limit the spread of the COVID‐19 infection; the patients who were admitted to the emergency service in the ‘Period of Normalisation’ when normalisation attempts were made and the restrictions were lifted; and the patients who were admitted to the emergency service in the ‘Period of Pre‐pandemic Normal’ exactly 1 year before the normalisation period, which would reflect the normal functioning of the emergency service at that time. The three groups were compared with respect to the demographic characteristics and patient outcomes (death/hospitalisation/discharge). RESULTS: A total of 69 474 patients were admitted to the emergency service in the ‘Period of Pre‐pandemic Normal’ whereas 21 278 patients were admitted in the ‘Period of Restrictions’. The number of emergency service admissions in the ‘Period of Restrictions’ was significantly lower (P < .01). A total of 72 843 patients were admitted to the emergency service in the ‘Period of Normalisation’. There was no statistically significant difference between the ‘Period of Pre‐pandemic Normal’ and the ‘Period of Normalisation’ in terms of the number of emergency service admissions (P = .127). A total of 9421 (13.5%) patients were hospitalised in the ‘Period of Pre‐pandemic Normal’ and the corresponding figure for the ‘Period of Normalisation’ was 19 876 (27.2%). A total of 24 (0.03%) patients died in the ‘Period of Pre‐pandemic Normal’, whereas 172 (0.23%) patients died in the ‘Period of Normalisation’. The number of patients who were hospitalised and lost in the ‘Period of Normalisation’ was significantly higher than that of patients who were hospitalised and lost in the ‘Period of Pre‐pandemic Normal’ (P < .01). CONCLUSION: In the period of COVID‐19 pandemic, fear of getting infected and the restrictions imposed to limit the spread of the disease have kept people out of hospitals. We believe that while the restrictions imposed on various activities have prevented the virus from spreading, they also caused the course of non‐COVID‐19 diseases to worsen and mortality rates to rise. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the public should be informed about the importance of uninterrupted treatment/follow‐up and ‘Life‐threatening Urgent Conditions’ that should necessarily prompt hospital visits in possible pandemics.","Görmeli Kurt, Nazlı; Çamcı, Melih",Int J Clin Pract,64,20

It presents with nasal congestion, nasal pruritus, posterior nasal drainage, rhinorrhea, and/or sneezing. During short procedures, nasal cannula administration of supplemental oxygen may be utilized to prevent hypoxia. Postprocedural rhinitis after intravenous sedation with supplemental nasal oxygen (PRAISE SNOG) - a noninflammatory variant of nonallergic rhinitis - has been observed in colonoscopy patients. Symptoms (sneezing and/or rhinorrhea with or without tearing) typically begin during emergence from sedation and persist for hours to days before resolving. A 66-year-old woman developed bilateral PRAISE SNOG following cataract extraction; her bilateral symptoms of nasal pruritus, rhinorrhea, and sneezing began immediately after awakening from sedation and spontaneously resolved within 24 hours. Mucosal irritation by the nasal cannula prongs that deliver the oxygen is a postulated pathogenesis for postprocedural rhinitis. Modification of the nasal prong composition (by using a soft silicon-based material), placement (by insertion prior to the induction of sedation and by not impinging on the nasal mucosa), and length (by trimming from 10 to two millimeters) are possible actions that might be initiated in order to prevent PRAISE SNOG.","Cohen, Philip R; Coden, Daniel J; Kurzrock, Razelle",Cureus,64,16

To support communication between families and patients a central London hospital introduced the role of the Family Liaison Officer. Communication within healthcare settings is often the subject of contention, particularly for patients families. During periods of crisis communication can become strained for patients and their families. We aimed to evaluate the rapid implementation of this role to provide guidance if it was required in the future and to explore the potential for this to become a standard role. Design: Service evaluation Setting: Single National Health Service hospital in London. Methods: Semi-structured video interviews with a convenience sample of 12 participants. Data were analysed using Framework Analysis. Participants: Family Liaison Officers (n=5) and colleagues who experienced working alongside them (n=7). Results: Key themes were identified from the interviews pertaining to the role, the team, the impact and the future. Two versions of the role emerged though the process based on the Family Liaison Officers previous background: Clinical Family Liaison Officers (primarily nurses) and Pastoral Family Liaison Officers (primarily play specialists). Both the Family Liaison Officers and their colleagues agreed that the role had a very positive impact on the wards during this time. Negative aspects of the role, such as a lack of induction, boundaries or clear structure were also discussed. Conclusion: The Family Liaison Officer was a key role during the pandemic in facilitating communication between patient, clinical team and family. The challenges associated with the role reflect the speed in which it was implemented but it was evident to those in the role and clinicians who the role was supporting that it has potential to help improve hospital communication, and the work of healthcare staff outside of a pandemic.","Hugghes, L.; Anderton, L.; Taylor, R.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study with an online survey was conducted among Iranian citizens. Correlation calculation and multiple linear regression analysis were performed on the studied variables to find the effective factors. RESULTS: A total of 1031 Iranian citizens over the age of 18 participated in this survey. A large percentage of the participants wanted to use the mHealth app to trace contacts of COVID-19 (74.5%) and the mHealth app to identify and monitor COVID-19 symptoms (74.0%). Gender, age, level of education, attitude towards technology, and fear of COVID-19 were among the factors that influenced the intention to use these two apps. The top reasons for using these apps were: “to keep myself and my family safe“, ”to control the spread of the coronavirus in general“, and “to cooperate with healthcare professionals”. The reasons given for not using these two apps were related to the issues of “security and privacy” and “doubt in efficiency and usefulness ”of them.

The majority of parents (76%) reported negative impacts of COVID-19 on family life, including parenting and emotional well-being despite exposure to COVID-19 cases being very low (4%). Family functioning and parent birthplace were associated with COVID-19 impact and distress. Parents perceived the hospital as a safe place during the pandemic. Very few parents reported delaying presentation to the emergency department (12%). The majority identified no change (69%) or delay (71%) in their child's treatment delivery. Over 90% of parents were confident that COVID-19 did not impact medical decision-making. They felt confident in their COVID-19 knowledge and sought information from trusted sources. Parents reported a positive relationship with their child's care team (93%); however, access to some support services was reduced. CONCLUSION: Understanding patient and family experiences of pediatric oncology care across international contexts during the pandemic is important to inform present and future health care responses. In the Australian context of low infection rates and strict community restrictions, parents perceived their child's oncology care to be relatively unaffected. However, findings indicate that family well-being was impacted, which warrants further investigation.","McCarthy, Maria C; Beamish, Jessica; Bauld, Catherine M; Marks, India R; Williams, Tria; Olsson, Craig A; De Luca, Cinzia R",Pediatr Blood Cancer,64,21

The very rapid global spread has raised the issue whether there are further multi‐dimensional consequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection on human behaviour, the key of its transmission. During the coronavirus crisis, odd, abnormal, and irresponsible behaviour has been reported in COVID‐19 individuals, particularly in super‐spreaders, i.e. persons with a high viral load, thus constituting also super‐emitters. Indeed, cases of infected persons ignoring self‐confinement orders, intentionally disregarding physical distancing and multiplying social interactions, or even deliberately sneezing, spitting or coughing were reported. While it is known that some other viruses such as rabies and even influenza do change human behaviour, this remains unclear for SARS‐CoV‐2. In this perspective, we highlight the possibility that COVID‐19 is facilitated by altered human social behaviour that benefits SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission, through showcasing similar virus‐induced changed behaviour by other pathogens and relating this to reports from the grey literature.

METHODS: Data were drawn from a descriptive, records-based review of reported cases of COVID-19 collected through the national COVID-19 Surveillance System from February to April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2,443 confirmed cases were reported during the study period. The overall first-time testing rate for this period was 851.7 per 100,000, the positivity rate was 53.1 (confidence intervals [CI]: 51.0–55.2) and the death rate was 0.32 (CI: 0.20–0.54) per 100,000 population, respectively. The overall national positive ratio was 5.7% and ranged from 2.2–7.1% across various governorates. Muscat Governorate had the highest positive ratio (12.5%). People in the 51–60 year old age group (RR = 1.97), males (RR = 1.24), non-Omanis (RR = 2.33) and those living in Muscat (RR = 2.14) emerged as categories with significant demographic risk for COVID-19 cases when compared to the national average. The mean age was 35.6 ± 13.4. Asymptomatic cases accounted for nearly 16%.

The single leg, medial countermovement jump provides objective measures of frontal plane force, velocity and power, and is relevant for ice hockey players given the similar lateral movement to ice skating. This study measured normative single leg, medial countermovement jump parameters (i.e., vertical and lateral maximum force, average concentric power and average concentric power during the last 100 ms) amongst male youth ice hockey players and assessed interlimb asymmetry in these healthy athletes. Ninety-one elite youth players participated in the study. Participants completed three right and three left jumps. Non-parametric tests were performed to evaluate between-jump and between-group comparisons. Many differences in jump force and power parameters were observed between the 10U/11U and 12U/13U age groups, and the 12U/13U and 14U/15U age groups, but differences were not as consistent between older or younger players. The average asymmetry index for each age group was less than 15% for force parameters, while the power parameters had larger asymmetry indices (between 9% and 22%).

The transmission of this virus via human to human interaction has already been described. The novel virus has become pandemic and declared as a comprehensive emergency worldwide by World Health Organization due to its exponential spread within and outside China. There is a need of time to create a therapeutic agent and a vaccine to cure and control this lethal SARS-CoV-2. Conventionally, the vaccine development process is time taking, tiresome and requires more economical inputs with manpower. However, bioinformatics offers a key solution to compute the possibilities. The present study focuses on the utilization of bioinformatics platforms to forecast B and T cell epitopes that belong to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. The protein is thought to have an involvement in triggering of momentous immune response. NCBI database was explored to collect the surface glycoprotein sequence and was analyzed to determine the immunogenic epitopes. This prediction analysis was carried out using IEDB web based server and the prediction of protein structure was done by homology modeling approach. This study resulted in prediction of 5 T cell and 13 B cell epitopes. Moreover, GPGPG linker was used to make these predicted epitopes a single peptide prior to further analysis. Afterwards, a 3D model of the final vaccine peptide was constructed, and the structure quality of the final construct was checked by Ramachandran Plot analysis and ProSA-web. Moreover, docking analysis highlighted three interactions of epitope against HLA-B7 including Lys 178, Gol 303 and Thr 31 residues. In conclusion, the predicted multi epitope peptide can be suggested as therapeutic or prophylactic candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 after further confirmation by immunological assays.","Asif Rasheed, Muhammad; Raza, Sohail; Zohaib, Ali; Ilyas Riaz, Muhammad; Amin, Amina; Awais, Muhammad; Ullah Khan, Sami; Ijaz Khan, M.; Chu, Yu-Ming",,64,1

Since April 2020, our research group has worked with data partners to collect, curate, and make publicly available numerous real-time COVID-19 indicators, providing multiple views of pandemic activity. This paper studies the utility of these indicators from a forecasting perspective. We focus on five indicators, derived from medical insurance claims data, web search queries, and online survey responses. For each indicator, we ask whether its inclusion in a simple model leads to improved predictive accuracy relative to a similar model excluding it. We consider both probabilistic forecasting of confirmed COVID-19 case rates and binary prediction of case ""hotspots"". Since the values of indicators (and case rates) are commonly revised over time, we take special care to ensure that the data provided to a forecaster is the version that would have been available at the time the forecast was made. Our analysis shows that consistent but modest gains in predictive accuracy are obtained by using these indicators, and furthermore, these gains are related to periods in which the auxiliary indicators behave as ""leading indicators"" of case rates.","McDonald, D.

However, the mode of virus transmission and tissue tropism is not well established yet. Recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ACE2+ cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2+ population of cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication. Notably, virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation, which could explain the bile acid accumulation and consequent liver damage in patients. These results indicate that control of liver damage caused directly by viral infection should be valued in treating COVID-19 patients. Our findings also provide an application of human organoids in investigating the tropism and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, which would facilitate novel drug discovery.","Zhao, Bing; Ni, Chao; Gao, Ran; Wang, Yuyan; Yang, Li; Wei, Jinsong; Lv, Ting; Liang, Jianqing; Zhang, Qisheng; Xu, Wei; Xie, Youhua; Wang, Xiaoyue; Yuan, Zhenghong; Liang, Junbo; Zhang, Rong; Lin, Xinhua",bioRxiv,64,16

We investigated the potential role of asymptomatic infection and silent transmission in London care homes that reported no cases of COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic. Methods Five care homes with no cases and two care homes reporting a single case of COVID-19 (non-outbreak homes) were investigated with nasal swabbing for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and serology for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies five weeks later. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on RT-PCR positive samples. Serology results were compared with those of six care homes with recognised outbreaks. Findings Across seven non-outbreak homes, 718 (387 staff, 331 residents) individuals had a nasal swab and 650 (385 staff, 265 residents) had follow-up serology. Sixteen individuals (13 residents, 3 staff) in five care homes with no reported cases were RT-PCR positive (care home positivity rates, 0 to 7.6%) compared to 13 individuals (3.0 and 11.1% positivity) in two homes reporting a single case. Seropositivity across these seven homes varied between 10.7-56.5%, with four exceeding community seroprevalence in London (14.8%). Seropositivity rates for staff and residents correlated significantly (rs 0.84, [95% CI 0.51-0.95] p <0.001) across the 13 homes. WGS identified multiple introductions into some homes and silent transmission of a single lineage between staff and residents in one home. Interpretation We found high rates of asymptomatic infection and transmission even in care homes with no COVID-19 cases. The higher seropositivity rates compared to RT-PCR positivity highlights the true extent of the silent outbreak.

However, to date, the trend of hospitalizations in the oncology patient population has not been studied, and the frequency of nosocomial spread to patients with cancer is not well understood. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of COVID‐19 on inpatient oncology census and determine the nosocomial rate of COVID‐19 in patients with cancer admitted at a large academic center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients with cancer diagnosed with COVID‐19 and admitted were reviewed to evaluate the temporal trends in inpatient oncology census during pre–COVID‐19 (January 2019 to February 2020), COVID‐19 (March to May 2020), and post–COVID‐19 surge (June to August 2020) in the region. In addition, nosocomial infection rates of SARS‐CoV‐2 were reviewed. RESULTS: Overall, the daily inpatient census was steady in 2019 (median, 103; range, 92–118) and until February 2020 (median, 112; range, 102–114). However, there was a major decline from March to May 2020 (median, 68; range, 57–104), with 45.4% lower admissions during April 2020. As the COVID‐19 surge eased, the daily inpatient census over time returned to the pre–COVID‐19 baseline (median, 103; range, 99–111). One patient (1/231, 0.004%) tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 13 days after hospitalization, and it is unclear if it was nosocomial or community spread. CONCLUSION: In this study, inpatient oncology admissions decreased substantially during the COVID‐19 surge but over time returned to the pre–COVID‐19 baseline. With aggressive infection control measures, the rates of nosocomial transmission were exceedingly low and should provide reassurance to those seeking medical care, including inpatient admissions when medically necessary. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The COVID‐19 pandemic has had a major impact on the health care system, and cancer patients are a vulnerable population. This study observes a significant decline in the daily inpatient oncology census from March to May 2020 compared with the same time frame in the previous year and examines the potential reasons for this decline. In addition, nosocomial rates of COVID‐19 were investigated, and rates were found to be very low. These findings suggest that aggressive infection control measures can mitigate the nosocomial infection risk among cancer patients and the inpatient setting is a safe environment, providing reassurance.","Zubiri, Leyre; Rosovsky, Rachel P.; Mooradian, Meghan J.; Piper‐Vallillo, A.J.; Gainor, Justin F.; Sullivan, Ryan J.; Marte, Daniel; Boland, Genevieve M.; Gao, Xin; Hochberg, Ephraim P.; Ryan, David P.; McEwen, Corey; Mai, Minh; Sharova, Tanya; Soumerai, Tara E.; Bardia, Aditya; Reynolds, Kerry L.",Oncologist,64,26

The ability to express and purify SARS-CoV proteins in large quantities is critical for basic research and for development of pharmaceutical agents. The work reported here demonstrates: (1) fusion of SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier), a 100 amino acid polypeptide, to the N-termini of SARS-CoV proteins dramatically enhances expression in Escherichia coli cells and (2) 6× His-tagged SUMO-fusions facilitate rapid purification of the viral proteins on a large scale. We have exploited the natural chaperoning properties of SUMO to develop an expression system suitable for proteins that cannot be expressed by traditional methodologies. A unique feature of the system is the SUMO tag, which enhances expression, facilitates purification, and can be efficiently cleaved by a SUMO-specific protease to generate native protein with a desired N-terminus. We have purified various SARS-CoV proteins under either native or denaturing conditions. These purified proteins have been used to generate highly specific polyclonal antibodies. Our study suggests that the SUMO-fusion technology will be useful for enhancing expression and purification of the viral proteins for structural and functional studies as well as for therapeutic uses.","Zuo, Xun; Mattern, Michael R.; Tan, Robin; Li, Shuisen; Hall, John; Sterner, David E.; Shoo, Joshua; Tran, Hiep; Lim, Peter; Sarafianos, Stefan G.; Kazi, Lubna; Navas-Martin, Sonia; Weiss, Susan R.; Butt, Tauseef R.",Protein Expr Purif,64,21

It causes Covid-19 disease which has become pandemic. Each of the five-known human β-coronaviruses has four major structural proteins (E, M, N and S) and 16 non-structural proteins encoded by ORF1a and ORF1b together (ORF1ab) that are involved in virus pathogenicity and infectivity. Here, we performed detailed positive selection analyses for those six genes among the four previously known human β-coronaviruses and within 38 SARS-CoV-2 genomes to assess signatures of adaptive evolution using maximum likelihood approaches. Our results suggest that three genes (E, S and ORF1ab genes) are under strong signatures of positive selection among human β-coronavirus, influencing codons that are located in functional important protein domains. The E protein-coding gene showed signatures of positive selection in two sites, Asp 66 and Ser 68, located inside a putative transmembrane α-helical domain C-terminal part, which is preferentially composed by hydrophilic residues. Such Asp and Ser sites substitutions (hydrophilic residues) increase the stability of the transmembrane domain in SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, substitutions in the spike (S) protein S1 N-terminal domain have been found, all of them were located on the S protein surface, suggesting their importance in viral transmissibility and survival. Furthermore, evidence of strong positive selection was detected in three of the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins (NSP1, NSP3, NSP16), which are encoded by ORF1ab and play vital roles in suppressing host translation machinery, viral replication and transcription and inhibiting the host immune response. These results are insightful to assess the role of positive selection in the SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins, which will allow to better understand the virulent pathogenicity of the virus and potentially identifying targets for drug or vaccine strategy design","Emam, Mohamed; Oweda, Mariam; Antunes, Agostinho; El-Hadidi, Mohamed",Virus Res,64,18

This scoping review aimed to synthesize and report evidence on the effectiveness of interventions using social robots or computer agents to reduce loneliness in older adults and to explore intervention strategies. METHODS: The review adhered to the Arksey and O’Malley process for conducting scoping reviews. The SCOPUS, PUBMED, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore databases were searched in November, 2020. A two-step selection process identified eligible research. Information was extracted from papers and entered into an Excel coding sheet and summarised. Quality assessments were conducted using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were included, of which most were of moderate to high quality. Eighteen were observational and 11 were experimental. Twenty-four used robots, four used computer agents and one study used both. The majority of results showed that robots or computer agents positively impacted at least one loneliness outcome measure. Some unintended negative consequences on social outcomes were reported, such as sadness when the robot was removed. Overall, the interventions helped to combat loneliness by acting as a direct companion (69%), a catalyst for social interaction (41%), facilitating remote communication with others (10%) and reminding users of upcoming social engagements (3%). CONCLUSION: Evidence to date suggests that robots can help combat loneliness in older adults, but there is insufficient research on computer agents. Common strategies for reducing loneliness include direct companionship and enabling social interactions. Future research could investigate other strategies used in human interventions (eg, addressing maladaptive social cognition and improving social skills), and the effects of design features on efficacy. It is recommended that more robust experimental and mixed methods research be conducted, using a combination of validated self-report, observational, and interview measures of loneliness.","Gasteiger, Norina; Loveys, Kate; Law, Mikaela; Broadbent, Elizabeth",Clin Interv Aging,64,20

AIM: To determine the impact of COVID-19 on incidence, severity, and outcomes of acute surgical admissions in an Irish University teaching hospital. METHODS: Descriptive data concerning patients presenting with acute appendicitis, diverticulitis, and cholecystitis were analysed and compared from March–May 2020 to March–May 2019. RESULTS: Acute surgical admissions decreased in March from 191 (2020) to 55 (2019) (55%), before increasing by 28% in April (2019: 119, 2020: 153). Admissions due to acute cholecystitis reduced by 33% (2019: 33, 2020: 22), with increased severity at presentation (P = 0.079) and higher 30-day readmission rates (P = 0.056) reported.
