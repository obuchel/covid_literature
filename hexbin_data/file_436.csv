4318,4318,4318,Neuromuscular blocking agents for acute respiratory distress syndrome: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,17.405462,11.875788,2020-01-13,"BACKGROUNDS: The aim of this study is investigating the benefits and harms of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: We comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library for randomized controlled trials comparing NMBAs to any other comparator. We pooled data using relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals. We assessed the quality of included studies using the Cochrane tool and levels of evidence using the GRADE method. RESULTS: Finally, six RCTs (n = 1557 patients) were eligible for analysis. The results showed NMBAs use was not associated with reduced 28 days mortality (RR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.06; P = 0.11), 90 days mortality (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.04; P = 0.16), and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.03; P = 0.13) in patients with ARDS. However, 21–28 days mortality was slightly lower in patients received NMBAs (RR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.99; P = 0.04; I(2) = 53%). Besides, NMBAs use could improve the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio at 48 and 72 h, decrease plateau pressure and PEEP at 72 h. Additionally, NMBAs had no significant effects on days free of ventilation at day 28 (WMD, 0.55; 95% CI, − 0.46 to 1.57; P = 0.29), days not in ICU at day 28 (WMD, 0.12; 95% CI, − 0.85 to 1.08; P = 0.82), ICU-acquired weakness (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.93; P = 0.06). Finally, NMBAs use was associated with a lower risk of barotrauma (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: In patients with respiratory distress syndrome, NMBAs may be beneficial in reverse refractory hypoxemia and may be associated with reduced short-term mortality and incidence of barotrauma. However, there is no significant effects of NMBAs on mid-term and long-term mortality, and further studies are required.","Zheng, Zhongjun; Jiang, Libing; Zhang, Song; Guervilly, Christophe; Zhang, Mao; Feng, Xia; Ding, Jianbo",Respir Res,436,9

METHODS: Chinese (TCMPeriodical Literature Database, Chinese Biological Medicine database, Chinese Medical Current Contents, China Hospital Knowledge Database journal fulltext database, Virtual Machining and Inspection System, and Wanfang) and English (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PubMed and Embase) databases were searched. RESULTS: Three thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five articles were initially identified, 606 of which met the inclusion criteria, including 251 in English (83 from the Cochrane Database) and 355 in Chinese. The number of articles published each year increased between 1989 and 2009. Cardiocerebrovascular disease was the most studied target disease. Intervention measures includedTCM preparations (177 articles), acupuncture (133 articles) and combinations of TCM and western medicine (38 articles). Control measures included positive medical (177 articles), basic treatment (100 articles), placebo (219 articles), and blank and mutual (107 articles). All articles included at least one reference; the greatest number was 268. Six of 10 articles with high quality references demonstrated curative effectsagainst target diseasesincludingupper respiratory tract infection, dementia and depression. Interventions that were not recommendedwere tripterygium for rheumatoid arthritis andTCM syndrome differentiation for pediatric nocturia. In 10.4% of the studies, the authors concluded that the intervention had a curative effect. The assessors agreed with the authors' conclusions in 88.32% of cases, but rejected 8.94% (54 articles). CONCLUSION: 1) Training in systematic review methods, including topic selection, study design, methods and technology, should be improved. 2) Upper respiratory tract infection, dementia and depression may become the predominant diseases treatedby TCM, and the corresponding interventions could be developed into practical applications. 3) Use of non-recommended interventions should be controlled, and there should be more research on side effects.","Wang, Junwen; Cui, Meng; Jiao, Hongguan; Tong, Yuanyuan; Xu, Jun; Zhao, Yingkai; Han, Mei; Liu, Jianping",,436,9

In addition, controversy remains about whether racial disparity in outcomes following MBS exists. Therefore, the aim of this analysis was to determine if race independently predicts outcomes in MBS patients with PSOT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with PSOT undergoing sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) were identified in the 2017 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation Quality and Improvement Project (MBSAQIP) database. Patients were stratified by race (Black and White). Propensity score matching was utilized to adjust for multiple demographic variables. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed for overall and bariatric-related morbidity. RESULTS: Of 335 MBS patients with PSOT, 250 (75%) were white and 85 (25%) were black patents. Procedure-type and surgical approach (p > 0.1) were similarly distributed. Black patients were more likely (p < 0.05) to have hypertension dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease, and be on chronic steroids). Mortality and morbidity were similar. Black patients had significantly (p < 0.05) higher rates of renal failure, pulmonary complications, and emergency department visits in unmatched analysis. After propensity score matching, 82 patients in each cohort were identified and were similar at baseline (p > 0.5). In the matched analysis, black patients had higher overall (17% vs. 10%, p = 0.12) and bariatric-related morbidity (14% vs. 7.2%, p = 0.05). In addition, black patients had significantly (p < 0.05) higher rates of postoperative pneumonias, progressive renal insufficiency, and emergency department visits. On multivariable regression analysis, black race did not independently predict overall or bariatric-related morbidity. CONCLUSION: MBS in racial cohorts with PSOT is safe, with very low rates of overall morbidity and mortality. Black race trended toward increased postoperative morbidity. Larger cohort studies are needed to validate our findings.

The cellular receptor for SVV mediating the selective tropism for tumors is anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1), a type I transmembrane protein expressed in tumors. Similar to other mammalian receptors, ANTXR1 has been shown to harbor N-linked glycosylation sites in its extracellular vWA domain. However, the exact role of ANTXR1 glycosylation on SVV attachment and cellular entry was unknown. Here we show that N-linked glycosylation in the ANTXR1 vWA domain is necessary for SVV attachment and entry. In our study, tandem mass spectrometry analysis of recombinant ANTXR1-Fc revealed the presence of complex glycans at N166, N184 in the vWA domain, and N81 in the Fc domain. Symmetry-expanded cryo-EM reconstruction of SVV-ANTXR1-Fc further validated the presence of N166 and N184 in the vWA domain. Cell blocking, co-immunoprecipitation, and plaque formation assays confirmed that deglycosylation of ANTXR1 prevents SVV attachment and subsequent entry. Overall, our results identified N-glycosylation in ANTXR1 as a necessary post-translational modification for establishing stable interactions with SVV. We anticipate our findings will aid in selecting patients for future cancer therapeutics, where screening for both ANTXR1 and its glycosylation could lead to an improved outcome from SVV therapy.","Jayawardena, Nadishka; Miles, Linde A.; Burga, Laura N.; Rudin, Charles; Wolf, Matthias; Poirier, John T.; Bostina, Mihnea",Viruses,436,14

In those cases, starting an adequate therapy through a rapid and assertive diagnosis is absolutely necessary. Considering the fastidious microbiological nature of some fungi (longtime requirement, specific culture conditions, and biohazard issues), as well as the lack of alternative testing availability, a rapid diagnosis is always challenging. When a tissue or liquid specimen is available, its pathological analysis constitutes a rapid and cost-effective way to provide a presumptive or definitive diagnosis of an invasive fungal infection; however, microbiologists, pathologists, and clinicians need to be aware of the limitations of microscopical diagnosis.

The hospital managers interviewed for this purpose identify potentials for improvement in communication, responsiveness to patient increases, administration, and IT equipment. The responses about the IT systems in use indicate that the hospitals already apply various technologies, but that these are mostly outdated, have too few interfaces, and, thus, do not meet the requirements of staff and patients. The evaluation shows the long-term potential of using information and communication technologies such as Mobile Health, Big Data, and Internet of Things to solve deficits concerning performance and sustainability.

With millions of individuals infected and over two hundred thousand deaths, the necessity to develop fast and efficient diagnostic methods is of high importance. Diagnostic modalities rely on a combination of epidemiology, clinical presentation, laboratory examination, and appropriate imaging to diagnose and distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other pulmonary infections. The purpose of this paper is to report on currently available diagnostic screening methods for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to guide frontline healthcare workers involved with COVID-19 patient care. METHODS: An electronic literature search was performed for peer-reviewed articles published from January 1, 2020, until April 26, 2020. Articles were then reviewed and included based on the applicability to the topic. RESULTS: The preferred diagnostic approach is reverse transcription of the virus’ RNA followed by PCR amplification (RT-PCR). This method recognizes the gene-specific primers to target various viral protein genes, such as the envelope protein gene or the nucleocapsid protein gene, which enables this test to be both sensitive and specific toward SARS-CoV-2. However, this method has been proven to be time-consuming taking hours-to-days for the results. In order to improve the speed and efficiency of diagnostics, newer rapid diagnostic serological tests are being developed for testing SARS-CoV-2, each with its own unique advantages and disadvantages. They could potentially be used as triage tests to rapidly identify patients who are very likely to have COVID-19 in combination with other accurate diagnostic methods. CONCLUSION: Therefore, a combination of diagnostic testing used in a timely manner may be beneficial for the rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2. This was evident in cases where despite initial negative RT-PCR tests for various patients, who later demonstrate chest CT scans with various degrees of consolidation and ground-glass opacity. Thus establishing the need for radiology diagnosis to be complementary to RT-PCR for COVID-19 patients. Hopefully, the continuous development and use of rapid diagnostic tests and the implementation of public health measures will help control the spread of the disease.","Sanyaolu, A; Okorie, C; Marinkovic, A; Ayodele, O; Abbasi, A; Prakash, S; Ahmed, M; Kayode, D; Jaferi, U; Haider, N",Am J Clin Pathol,436,16

Numerous plant products, for example flavonoids, are documented in studies for having the ability to pass the blood-brain barrier and moderate the development of such illnesses. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) has achieved importance in the drug discovery world; innovative developments in the aspects of structure identification and characterization, bio-computational science, and molecular biology have added to the preparation of new medications towards these ailments. In this study we evaluated nine flavonoid compounds identified from three medicinal plants, namely T. diversifolia, B. sapida, and I. gabonensis for their inhibitory role on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, using pharmacophore modeling, auto-QSAR prediction, and molecular studies, in comparison with standard drugs. The results indicated that the pharmacophore models produced from structures of AChE, BChE and MAO could identify the active compounds, with a recuperation rate of the actives found near 100% in the complete ranked decoy database. Moreso, the robustness of the virtual screening method was accessed by well-established methods including enrichment factor (EF), receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), Boltzmann-enhanced discrimination of receiver operating characteristic (BEDROC), and area under accumulation curve (AUAC). Most notably, the compounds’ pIC(50) values were predicted by a machine learning-based model generated by the AutoQSAR algorithm. The generated model was validated to affirm its predictive model. The best models achieved for AChE, BChE and MAO were models kpls_radial_17 (R(2) = 0.86 and Q(2) = 0.73), pls_38 (R(2) = 0.77 and Q(2) = 0.72), kpls_desc_44 (R(2) = 0.81 and Q(2) = 0.81) and these externally validated models were utilized to predict the bioactivities of the lead compounds. The binding affinity results of the ligands against the three selected targets revealed that luteolin displayed the highest affinity score of −9.60 kcal/mol, closely followed by apigenin and ellagic acid with docking scores of −9.60 and −9.53 kcal/mol, respectively. The least binding affinity was attained by gallic acid (−6.30 kcal/mol). The docking scores of our standards were −10.40 and −7.93 kcal/mol for donepezil and galanthamine, respectively. The toxicity prediction revealed that none of the flavonoids presented toxicity and they all had good absorption parameters for the analyzed targets.

However, the role of different wastewater treatment stages in reducing viral RNA concentrations is, thus far, unknown. Here, we quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw sewage and during the main stages of the activated sludge process from two wastewater treatment plants in Israel, on three different days during the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. To reduce the detection limit, samples were concentrated prior to quantification by real-time polymerase chain reaction by a factor of 2–43 using ultrafiltration. On average, ∼1 log RNA removal was attained by each of the primary and secondary treatment steps; however, >100 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA/mL remained in the secondary effluents. Following chlorination, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected only once, likely due to an insufficient chlorine dose. Our results emphasize the capabilities and limitations of the conventional wastewater treatment process in reducing the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration and present preliminary evidence for the importance of tertiary treatment and chlorination in reducing dissemination of the virus to the environment.","Abu Ali, Hala; Yaniv, Karin; Bar-Zeev, Edo; Chaudhury, Sanhita; Shagan, Marilou; Lakkakula, Satish; Ronen, Zeev; Kushmaro, Ariel; Nir, Oded",,436,1

For this purpose, we use data from the 50 US states and place the formal analysis in the context of socio-economic drivers of vaccinations. Results show that state-economic prosperity and rural population aid vaccine administration and delivery efficiency. Delivery efficiency improves in states with more nursing homes per capita, in states with more COVID-19 deaths, and with more health workers. A subset of health workers, including physicians and nurses, did not significantly impact administration or efficiency. On the other hand, vaccination efficiency was lower in states with a centralized public health agency. States with a larger share of the elderly population and those with Democrats as governors were no different from others with regard to vaccinations. Robustness checks are performed using vaccination data from a more recent period.

Previous study has evaluated groundwater contamination risk at Yinchuan Plain, China, according to aquifer vulnerability. The present study enriches the assessment of contamination risk by adding pollution loading, which represents the hazard from human activities, and groundwater value, which represents the economic loss as a result of groundwater pollution. An approach that combines toxicity, release possibility, and the potential release quantity of pollutants on the ground surface was used to estimate the pollution loading. An integrated approach that considered both the in situ and extractive values was used to estimate groundwater value. In addition, a basic risk map was constructed by overlying the vulnerability and pollution loading maps showing the potential probability of pollution, while a value-weighted risk map was produced by overlying the basic risk and value map indicating the urgency of protection. The validation by specific contaminants shows the reliability of the basic risk assessment. Both the basic and value-weighted risk maps indicate a very high groundwater contamination risk in Yinchuan City, and the southern part of Yinchuan Plain exhibited a relatively high contamination risk. As a result of not only high vulnerability but also very high pollution loading and groundwater value, Yinchuan City is the most urgent area requiring groundwater protection. The produced maps provide effective information for decision-making regarding the optimization of monitoring network, preferential treatment, and allocating future potentially hazardous.","Li, Xinyan; Wu, Hao; Qian, Hui",Environmental science and pollution research international,436,16

This study aims to assess post-traumatic growth (PTG) of Chinese nurses and GP during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study employed PTG in Chinese nurses and GP with Posttraumatic growth inventory questionnaire (PTGI) via a mobile app-based questionnaire, anxiety and ways to copy with stress in nurses were also employed. A total of 455 nurses and 424 GP were included in the statistical analysis. Results indicated that score of total PTGI and three dimensions, new possibilities, personal strength and spiritual change, were different between nurses and GP. Furthermore, score of total PTGI and all domains were significantly different between 178 front-line nurses (FLNs) and 277 non-front-line nurses (nFLNs). Importantly, sex, marriage status, professional titles, fertility, anxiety and ways to copy with stress were associated with PTG in nurses. Moreover, marriage status and ways to copy with stress were the predictors of PTG in nurses. Interestingly, this study found that WeChat network psychological counseling and phone app of application self-relaxation were good and effective coping strategies for nurses to relieve stress. Thus, the development of valid intervention programs for nurses to diminish job burnout and increase care quality was also important.","Li, Lin; Mao, Ming; Wang, Shuya; Yin, Rulan; Yan, Hai'Ou; Jin, Yue; Cheng, Yun","Psychology, health & medicine",436,16

Because data regarding whether and when to perform a PN biopsy in patients with cancer are scarce, clinicians tend to assume that PNs are metastatic disease based solely on imaging. The current study evaluated the findings of PN biopsies in a population of patients with cancer and sought to determine the variables that correlated with higher odds of metastatic disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective, single-institution study that included consecutive patients with nonpulmonary solid malignancies who underwent PN biopsy from January 2011 to December 2013. Imaging and clinical variables were analyzed by logistic regression to determine the correlation between such variables and the odds of metastatic disease. Patients with previously known metastatic disease or primary hematologic malignancies were excluded. RESULTS Two hundred twenty-eight patients were included in the study. Metastatic disease was found in 146 patients (64%), 60 patients (26.3%) were diagnosed with a second primary lung tumor, and 22 patients (9.6%) had no cancer on biopsy. On multivariate analysis, the presence of multiple PNs (> 5 mm) and cavitation/necrosis were the only variables associated with higher odds (P < .05) of metastatic disease. We registered six (2.6%) procedure complications demanding active interventions, and no procedure-related death occurred. CONCLUSION Multiple PNs (> 5 mm) and cavitation were the two characteristics associated with the highest chances of metastatic disease. Our findings demonstrate that PNs should not be assumed to be metastases without performing a biopsy. This assumption may lead to high rates of misdiagnosis. Tissue sampling is fundamental for accurately diagnosing patients with cancer.","Caparica, Rafael; Mak, Milena Perez; Rocha, Claudio Henrique; Velho, Pedro Henrique Isaacsson; Viana, Publio; Moura, Mauricio R L; Menezes, Marcos Roberto; Amato, Marcelo B P; Feher, Olavo",Journal of global oncology,436,31

This study aimed to propose a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model of dexmedetomidine in a heterogeneous group of intensive care unit patients, incorporating 29 covariates potentially linked with dexmedetomidine PK. Data were collected from 70 patients aged between 0.25 and 88 years and treated with dexmedetomidine infusion for various durations at 1 of 4 medical centers. Statistical analysis was performed using a nonlinear mixed-effect model. Categorical and continuous covariates including demographic data, hemodynamic parameters, biochemical markers, and 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were tested. A 2-compartment model was used to describe dexmedetomidine PK. An allometric/isometric scaling was used to account for body weight difference in PK parameters, and the Hill equation was used to describe the maturation of clearance. Typical values of the central and peripheral volume of distribution and the systemic and distribution clearance for a theoretical adult patient were central volume of distribution = 22.50 L, peripheral volume of distribution = 86.1 L, systemic clearance = 34.7 L/h, and distribution clearance = 40.8 L/h. The CYP1A2 genetic polymorphism and noradrenaline administration were identified as significant covariates for clearance. A population PK model of dexmedetomidine was successfully developed. The proposed model is well calibrated to the observed data. The identified covariates account for <5% of interindividual variability and consequently are of low clinical significance for the purpose of dose adjustment.","Ber, Justyna; Wiczling, Paweł; Hołysz, Marcin; Klupczyńska, Agnieszka; Bartkowska-Śniatkowska, Alicja; Bieda, Krzysztof; Smuszkiewicz, Piotr; Nowicka, Małgorzata; Żurański, Łukasz; Sobczyński, Paweł; Matysiak, Jan; Grześkowiak, Edmund; Bienert, Agnieszka",Journal of clinical pharmacology,436,1

We also investigated the influence of suspension of governmental recommendation for HPV vaccination since June 2013. METHODS During 2011-2020, we conducted a self-completed questionnaire survey among newly enrolled female medical school students in Yokohama, Japan. The questionnaire featured items regarding HPV vaccination status, age, previous sex education, and knowledge about cervical cancer and HPV vaccination. RESULTS HPV vaccine uptake rates in 2011 (5.4%) and 2012 (13.5%), when vaccination was self-funded, increased after 2013 (48.7%), when vaccination fees were subsidized. The rate dropped drastically in 2019 (14.3%) and 2020 (5.1%), after suspension of recommendation by the government. Comparisons between new students in 2015/2016, who had high vaccination rates (65.2%), and new students in 2019/2020, who had low vaccination rates (9.8%), showed decreased levels of HPV vaccination awareness, with fewer students having covered cervical cancer prevention in sex education and with respondents having less knowledge about the details of HPV vaccination. CONCLUSIONS After the suspension of proactive HPV vaccine recommendation, markedly fewer students have been vaccinated against HPV, even those at the vaccination target age. This situation has substantially influenced the lower awareness about cervical cancer prevention, even among medical school students. To protect young women from cervical cancer in Japan, it is crucial for the government to resume proactive recommendation of HPV vaccines as soon as possible.","Sukegawa, Akiko; Ohshige, Kenji; Suzuki, Yukio; Mizushima, Taichi; Ueda, Yutaka; Sekine, Masayuki; Enomoto, Takayuki; Miyagi, Etsuko",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,436,5

In 2018, overdose deaths primarily involved opioids, with continued increases in deaths involving illicitly manufactured fentanyls (IMFs). Deaths involving stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine are also increasing, mainly in combination with opioids. METHODS CDC analyzed data on drug overdose deaths during January-June 2019 from 24 states and the District of Columbia (DC) in the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System to describe characteristics and circumstances of opioid- and stimulant-involved overdose deaths. RESULTS Among 16,236 drug overdose deaths in 24 states and DC, 7,936 (48.9%) involved opioids without stimulants, 5,301 (32.6%) involved opioids and stimulants, 2,056 (12.7%) involved stimulants without opioids, and 943 (5.8%) involved neither opioids nor stimulants. Approximately 80% of overdose deaths involved one or more opioid, and IMFs were involved in three of four opioid-involved overdose deaths. IMFs, heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine (alone or in combination) were involved in 83.8% of overdose deaths. More than three in five (62.7%) overdose deaths had documentation of at least one potential opportunity for overdose prevention intervention. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE Identifying opportunities to intervene before an overdose death and implementing evidence-based prevention policies, programs, and practices could save lives. Strategies should address characteristics of overdoses involving IMFs, such as rapid overdose progression, as well as opioid and stimulant co-involvement. These efforts should be complemented by efforts to prevent initiation of prescription opioid and stimulant misuse and illicit drug use.","O'Donnell, Julie; Gladden, R Matt; Mattson, Christine L; Hunter, Calli T; Davis, Nicole L",MMWR.

METHODS A case-matched controlled prospective analysis of 54 patients who underwent laparoscopic-assisted resection for stage I to III (no T4) rectal cancer within 12 cm of the anal verge from 2002 to 2005 was performed. Patients were matched with contemporary patients who underwent open rectal cancer surgery (n = 108) in a 1 to 2 fashion. The perioperative clinical outcomes, postoperative pathology, and oncologic outcomes were compared between the groups. RESULTS The demographic data did not differ significantly between the groups. The laparoscopic group manifested early return of bowel function (P = .003). The complication rate was 22.2% in the laparoscopic group and 32.4% in the open group (P = .178). Local recurrence was similar (2.0% laparoscopic, 4.2% open, P = .417). The 5-year overall and disease-free survival rate also were similar (overall survival, 90.8% laparoscopic, 88.5% open, P = .261; disease-free survival, 80.8% laparoscopic, 75.8% open. P = .390).

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a valuable experimental tool facilitating quantification of the thermodynamic parameters that characterize recognition processes involving biomacromolecules. The method provides access to all relevant thermodynamic information by performing a few experiments. In particular, ITC experiments allow to by-pass tedious and (rarely precise) procedures aimed at determining the changes in enthalpy and entropy upon binding by van't Hoff analysis. Notwithstanding limitations, ITC has now the reputation of being the ""gold standard"" and ITC data are widely used to validate theoretical predictions of thermodynamic parameters, as well as to benchmark the results of novel binding assays. In this paper, we discuss several publications from 2007 reporting ITC results. The focus is on applications in biologically oriented fields.

The authors reviewed cognitive and developmental outcomes in pediatric patients who underwent resection of the epileptogenic zone involving the insula. METHODS A review was conducted of 15 patients who underwent resective epilepsy surgery involving the insular cortex for focal cortical dysplasia, with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. The median age at surgery was 5.6 years (range 0.3-13.6 years). Developmental/intelligence quotient (DQ/IQ) scores were evaluated before surgery, within 4 months after surgery, and at 12 months or more after surgery. Repeated measures multivariate ANOVA was used to evaluate the effects on outcomes of the within-subject factor (time) and between-subject factors (resection side, anterior insular resection, seizure control, and antiepileptic drug [AED] reduction). RESULTS The mean preoperative DQ/IQ score was 60.7 ± 22.8. Left-side resection and anterior insular resection were performed in 9 patients each. Favorable seizure control (International League Against Epilepsy class 1-3) was achieved in 8 patients. Postoperative motor deficits were observed in 9 patients (permanent in 6, transient in 3). Within-subject changes in DQ/IQ were not significantly affected by insular resection (p = 0.13). Postoperative changes in DQ/IQ were not significantly affected by surgical side, anterior insular resection, AED reduction, or seizure outcome. Only verbal function showed no significant changes before and after surgery and no significant effects of within-subject factors. CONCLUSIONS Resection involving the insula in children with impaired development or intelligence can be performed without significant reduction in DQ/IQ, but carries the risk of postoperative motor deficits.","Ikegaya, Naoki; Iwasaki, Masaki; Kaneko, Yuu; Kaido, Takanobu; Kimura, Yuiko; Yamamoto, Tetsuya; Sumitomo, Noriko; Saito, Takashi; Nakagawa, Eiji; Sugai, Kenji; Sasaki, Masayuki; Takahashi, Akio; Otsuki, Taisuke",Journal of neurosurgery.

The utilization of trehalose as a nutrient source by bacteria relies on carbohydrate active enzymes, specifically those of the glycoside hydrolase family 37, to degrade the disaccharide into substituent glucose moieties for entry into metabolism. Environmental bacteria using oligosaccharides for nutrients often possess multiple carbohydrate active enzymes predicted to have the same biochemical activity, and therefore are thought to be functionally redundant. In this study, we characterized trehalose degradation by the biotechnologically important saprophytic bacterium Cellvibrio japonicus This bacterium possesses two predicted α-α-trehalase genes, tre37A and tre37B, and our investigation using mutational analysis found that only the former is essential for trehalose utilization by C. japonicus Heterologous expression experiments found that only the expression of the C. japonicus tre37A gene in an E. coli treA mutant strain allowed for full utilization of trehalose. Biochemical characterization of C. japonicus GH37 activity determined that the tre37A gene product is solely responsible for cleaving trehalose, and is an acidic α-α-trehalase. Bioinformatic and mutational analysis indicate that Tre37A directly cleaves trehalose to glucose in the periplasm, as C. japonicus does not possess a phosphotransferase system. This study facilitates the development of a comprehensive metabolic model for α-linked disaccharides in C. japonicus, and more broadly expands our understanding of the strategies that saprophytic bacteria employ to capture diverse carbohydrates from the environment.IMPORTANCE The metabolism of α-diglucosides like trehalose is becoming increasingly important due to its inclusion in a number of foods and its prevalence in the environment. Bacteria able to utilize trehalose in the human gut possess a competitive advantage, as do saprophytic microbes in terrestrial environments. While the biochemical mechanism of trehalose degradation is well understood, what is less clear is how bacteria acquire this metabolite from the environment. The significance of this report is that by using the model saprophyte Cellvibrio japonicus we were able to functionally characterize the two predicted trehalase enzymes that the bacterium possesses and determined that the two enzymes are not equivalent and are not functionally redundant. The results and approaches used to understand the complex physiology of α-diglucoside metabolism from this study can be applied broadly to other polysaccharide-degrading bacteria.","Garcia, Cecelia A; Narrett, Jackson A; Gardner, Jeffrey G",Applied and environmental microbiology,436,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS We collected procedural and clinical data of 104 patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy due to ELVO between June 2014 and January 2016 with intentional first-line thrombus aspiration. Procedures were conducted due to occlusions of the distal internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, basilar artery and posterior cerebral artery and were performed with the patient under either conscious sedation or general anesthesia. If the AST technique failed completely or to some extent, stent retriever-based thrombectomy (SRT) was performed. RESULTS As a stand-alone method AST was successful in achieving TICI (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction) score 2b or 3 results in 29 cases (27.8%). After additional use of SRT successful recanalization was achieved in a total of 95 cases (91.3%, p = 0.048). If AST was performed exclusively, median procedure time until TICI 2b/3 was 15 min, in cases of combined procedures 35 min (p = 0.001). Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) after thrombectomy appeared only if additional SRT was performed (12.0%) and not in cases of AST maneuvers alone (p = 0.09). CONCLUSION When used as a first pass attempt AST is a fast and safe approach for patients suffering from stroke due to ELVO. Nonetheless, early conversion to SRT is needed in most cases and leads to overall excellent procedural results with low complication rates.","Prothmann, S; Friedrich, B; Boeckh-Behrens, T; Zimmer, C; Kaesmacher, J; Lucia, K; Maegerlein, C",Clinical neuroradiology,436,1

The role of MRF has also been advocated in modulation of state of arousal leading to transition from wakefulness to sleep and it is further considered to be a main player in the pathophysiology of gait disorders seen in Parkinson's disease. However, the existence of a mesencephalic locomotor region and of an arousal center has not yet been demonstrated in primates. Here, we provide the first extensive electrophysiological mapping of the MRF using extracellular recordings at rest and during locomotion in a nonhuman primate (NHP) (Macaca fascicularis) model of bipedal locomotion. We found different neuronal populations that discharged according to a phasic or a tonic mode in response to locomotion, supporting the existence of a locomotor neuronal circuit within these MRF in behaving primates. Altogether, these data constitute the first electrophysiological characterization of a locomotor neuronal system present within the MRF in behaving NHPs under normal conditions, in accordance with several studies done in different experimental animal models.

Our paper also considered the methodological implications for the wider field of library and information science as well as specific implications for health information and library workers. CONCLUSIONS Novel insights were derived on how users communicate about disease outbreaks on social media platforms. Our study also provides an innovative methodological contribution because it was found that by utilising an indepth method it was possible to extract greater insight into user communication.","Ahmed, Wasim; Bath, Peter A; Sbaffi, Laura; Demartini, Gianluca",Health information and libraries journal,436,7

We analyzed clot and interventional data from 145 retrieval trials performed for 37 patients (69.5±14.0 years, 20 men, large artery atherosclerosis, n = 7; cardioembolism, n = 22; undetermined etiology, n = 8) who had undergone intra-arterial thrombectomy. Rates of clot retrieval and successful recanalization (Arterial Occlusive Lesion score of 2-3) for separate retrieval trials were evaluated. The area occupied by red blood cell (RBC), fibrin/platelets, and white blood cell (WBC) was measured from digitized images of hematoxylin-eosin stained clots. Compositional differences were compared according to recanalization success, stroke subtype, and the presence of hyperdense clot sign on initial computed tomography and/or blooming artifact on magnetic resonance image. Of the 145 total retrieval trials (3.4±2.4 times per patient), clot was retrieved in 93 trials (64%), while recanalization was successful in 73 (50%). Fibrin/platelets (63%) occupied the greatest area in retrieved clots, followed by RBCs (33%) and WBCs (4%). Clots retrieved from successful recanalization exhibited higher RBC composition (37%) than those retrieved from non-recanalization trials (20%, p = 0.001). RBC composition was higher in cardioembolic stroke (38%) rather than large artery atherosclerosis (23%) and undetermined etiology (26%, p = 0.01). Clots exhibiting clot signs (40%) had higher RBC composition than those without clot signs (19%, p = 0.001). RBC-rich clots were associated with successful recanalization of intra-arterial thrombectomy, cardioembolic stroke, and the presence of clot-signs on initial brain images.","Shin, Jong Wook; Jeong, Hye Seon; Kwon, Hyon-Jo; Song, Kyu Sang; Kim, Jei",PloS one,436,1

A few longitudinal studies focused on one single direction. Whether the association between arterial stiffness and diabetes is bidirectional remains unclear to date. Objective: To explore the temporal relationship between arterial stiffness and fasting blood glucose (FBG) status. Methods and Results: Included were 14,159 participants of the Kailuan study with assessment of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) from 2010 to 2015, and free of diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease at baseline. FBG and baPWV were repeatedly measured at baseline and follow-ups. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of incident diabetes across baseline baPWV groups: <1,400 cm/s (ref), 1,400 {less than or equal to} baPWV < 1,800 cm/s, and {greater than or equal to}1,800cm/s. Path analysis was used to analyze the possible temporal causal relationship between baPWV and FBG, among 8,956 participants with repeated assessment of baPWV and FBG twice in 2010-2017. The mean baseline age of the observed population was 48.3{plus minus}12.0 years. During mean 3.72 years of follow-up, 979 incident diabetes cases were identified. After adjusting for potential confounders, the HR (95% CI) for risk of diabetes was 1.59 (1.34, 1.88) for the borderline arterial stiffness group and 2.11 (1.71, 2.61) for the elevated arterial stiffness group, compared with the normal ideal arterial stiffness group. In the path analysis, baseline baPWV was associated with follow-up FBG (the standard regression coefficient was 0.09; 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.10). In contrast, the standard regression coefficient of baseline FBG for follow-up baPWV (β = 0.00, 95% CI: -0.02 to 0.02) was not significant. Conclusions: Arterial stiffness, as measured by baPWV, was associated with risk of developing diabetes. Arterial stiffness appeared to precede the increase in FBG.","Zheng, Mengyi; Zhang, Xinyuan; Chen, Shuohua; Song, Yongjian; Zhao, Quanhui; Gao, Xiang; Wu, Shouling",Circulation research,436,1

We describe the use of the transciliary supraorbital approach (eyebrow approach) for resection of craniopharyngiomas with retrochiasmatic extension. METHODS Our clinical database was reviewed to identify operative cases of craniopharyngiomas between July 1998 and January 2011. Only patients who had retrochiasmatic extension and underwent an eyebrow approach were included in this analysis. Endoscopy was used to aid surgical resection at the discretion of the surgeon. Six patients were identified (three from a retrospective review and three during the course of prospective follow-up evaluation). RESULTS The group included three men and three women (mean age: 41.2 years; range: 28-57 years). All patients had visual and hormonal deficits at presentation. Complete resection was achieved in four patients. Endoscopic assistance was used in three patients. Opening of the frontal sinus occurred in two cases during surgery; an additional surgical procedure was required for repair of a cerebrospinal fluid leak in one of these cases. The duration of clinical follow-up ranged from 18 to 97 months. All patients had excellent cosmetic results, visual improvement to a serviceable level, and a Karnofsky performance scale score ≥ 80. CONCLUSIONS The eyebrow approach is safe for resection of craniopharyngiomas with retrochiasmatic extension. This approach offers a reasonable surgical corridor for resection of the retrochiasmatic tumor component and can be enhanced using endoscopic assistance.","Tawk, Rabih G; Binning, Mandy J; Thomas, Justin M; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Grand, Walter","Journal of neurological surgery.

The isolated strains were characterized by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of the hypervariable region 3 of the S1 spike glycoprotein gene. Three out of five isolates formed a distinct phylogenetic group with the Egypt/Beni-Suef/01 variant (Var 1). Two of the five isolates showed 89 and 84 % amino acid sequence identity and 89 and 88 % nucleotide sequence identity to the Egyptian variant 1 and the IS/885 strains, respectively. The Ck/Eg/BSU-2/2011 and Ck/Eg/BSU-3/2011 strains showed 15 and 20 and 12 and 18 amino acid substitutions relative to Egypt/Beni-Suef/01 and IS/885, respectively. The results indicate that Ck/Eg/BSU-2/2011 and Ck/Eg/BSU-3/2011 can be considered a new IBV variant. This study demonstrates a constant evolution of IBV in Egypt that necessitates continuous monitoring to control the spread of infections, and the development and use of vaccines based on indigenous viruses.","Abdel-Moneim, Ahmed S; Afifi, Manal A; El-Kady, Magdy F",Archives of virology,436,1

Seven male British military personnel completed two bouts of cycling at the same relative workload (55% Wmax) for 120 min on acute exposure to altitude (3375 m) and at sea level (~113 m). In each trial, participants ingested 1.2 g·min-1 of glucose (enriched with 13C glucose) and 0.6 g·min-1 of fructose (enriched with 13C fructose) directly before and every 15 min during exercise. Indirect calorimetry and isotope ratio mass spectrometry were used to calculate fat oxidation, total and exogenous carbohydrate oxidation, plasma glucose oxidation, and endogenous glucose oxidation derived from liver and muscle glycogen. Total carbohydrate oxidation during the exercise period was lower at altitude (157.7 ± 56.3 g) than sea level (286.5 ± 56.2 g, P = 0.006, ES = 2.28), whereas fat oxidation was higher at altitude (75.5 ± 26.8 g) than sea level (42.5 ± 21.3 g, P = 0.024, ES = 1.23). Peak exogenous carbohydrate oxidation was lower at altitude (1.13 ± 0.2 g·min-1) than sea level (1.42 ± 0.16 g·min-1, P = 0.034, ES = 1.33). There were no differences in rates, or absolute and relative contributions of plasma or liver glucose oxidation between conditions during the second hour of exercise. However, absolute and relative contributions of muscle glycogen during the second hour were lower at altitude (29.3 ± 28.9 g, 16.6 ± 15.2%) than sea level (78.7 ± 5.2 g (P = 0.008, ES = 1.71), 37.7 ± 13.0% (P = 0.016, ES = 1.45).

In this study, a sustainable and cost-effective method for the synthesis of lignin-containing cellulose nanocrystals (LCNC) from oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) is presented. This method is able to retain the lignin in EFB and manifest the properties of lignin. The proposed synthesis process is simpler than the conventional method of producing lignin-coated CNC by first removing the lignin to synthesize CNC followed by the re-coating of lignin on the structure. The samples of LCNC were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and water contact angle analysis. In addition, by altering the acid concentration during acid hydrolysis process (53% - 60% H2SO4), both surface hydrophobicity (66.0° - 75.1°) and length of LCNC (467 nm-177 nm) can be altered wherein a higher concentration of acid resulted in a greater contact angle and a shorter length of LCNC. Cost and energy analysis deduced that the proposed synthesis method saved about 62% of the total material cost and 80% less energy as compared to the synthesis of lignin-coated CNC.","Teh, Khai Chyi; Foo, Mei Ling; Ooi, Chien Wei; Leng Chew, Irene Mei",Chemosphere,436,16

In Japan, a large variation was observed in between geographical areas when assessing mortality. We performed a regional correlation analysis to find factors related to regional mortality. Methods This study design was an ecologic study. A multiple regression analysis was performed with COVID-19 mortality rates of different countries as the dependent variable together with various health care and economic factors. We calculated the cumulative mortality rate as of June 30, 2020. For the regional correlation analysis of Japan, 47 prefectures were divided into nine regions. The factors examined were health care and tourism. Data for 33 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries were analyzed. In Japan's regional analysis, the whole country was classified into nine regions. Results Factors related to mortality were the incidence of Kawasaki disease (KD), number of computed tomographies (CTs), and alcohol consumption. Mortality was low in countries with high incidence of KD and high number of CTs, as well as in countries with high alcohol consumption. In European countries, high smoking prevalence and a high Gini coefficient were positively related to high mortality. According to a regional analysis in Japan, mortality was related to proportion of population in the densely inhabited districts, the number of foreign visitors per capita, and the number of Chinese visitors per capita. Conclusion Low mortality in East Asia was associated with specific disease morbidity (KD), alcohol consumption, and CT numbers. It was suggested that the mortality gap in Japan was related to the number of foreign tourists and the proportion of population in the densely inhabited districts.","Osaki, Yoneatsu; Otsuki, Hitoshi; Imamoto, Aya; Kinjo, Aya; Fujii, Maya; Kuwabara, Yuki; Kondo, Yoko",Yonago acta medica,436,28

Postoperative treatment consisted of a combination of anti-TB drug treatment for 18 months and brace fixed braking for 3-9 months. Clinical outcome, laboratory indexes, and radiological results were analysed. RESULTS The average follow-up time was 34.1 months (12-60 months). Pain was relieved postoperatively in all cases, and 87.8% of patients were painless at the final follow-up. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) significantly decreased and returned to normal at the final follow-up. The fusion rate of allografts was 30.2% and 98.4% at the 9- and 12-month follow-ups, respectively. At the final follow-up, the fusion rate was 100%. CONCLUSION The application of allografts in the surgical management of spinal tuberculosis is safe and effective. Allografts can replace autografts in surgeries for spinal tuberculosis.","Sen, Yang; Wenjie, Wu; Fei, Luo; Zehua, Zhang",Turkish neurosurgery,436,16

More than two thirds of recently incarcerated individuals will be arrested again within 3 years of release and may commit crimes as serious as homicide soon after discharge. The pattern of homicidal violence currently remains unknown for recently incarcerated homicide suspects (RIHS) and their victims. METHODS A retrospective analysis of the 36 states included in the 2003-2017 National Violent Death Reporting System was performed with a focus on RIHS and their victims. Pearson's chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for comparison. RESULTS There were 249 RIHS in the database of the 14,561 homicides where suspect recent incarceration status was documented. Compared to not-recently incarcerated suspects, RIHS were more likely to be white (41% vs 29%, p<0.001) and male (97% vs 91%, p<0.001). RIHS more often had a known relationship with the victim (75% vs 51%, p < 0.001), and these homicides more often occurred in the victim's own home (43% vs 34%, p=0.006). Intimate partner violence was a factor in 31% of the RIHS cases (vs 17%, p < 0.001). The homicide weapon was most likely to be a firearm (57.8%, p < 0.001). Only 6.4% of homicides were due to mental health illness. Gang violence, while more common in the RIHS group, was still only a precipitating factor in 12.0% of the homicides (vs 7.4%, p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS RIHS are more likely to kill a known person in their own home with a firearm and these homicides are frequently categorized as intimate partner homicides. Gang violence and mental health are not frequent precipitating factors in these deaths. Additional future interventions are urgently needed to eliminate these preventable deaths by alerting previous or current intimate partners of those being discharged from the prison system.

Although hyperglycemia in T2DM (type 2 diabetes mellitus) lead to a series of changes, however, little is known about the alterations of serum proteins in T2DM, especially those proteins with glucose affinity. METHODS In this study, the GlcBPs (glucose binding proteins) of serum were isolated from 30 HV (Health Volunteer) and 30 T2DM patients by GMPC (glucose-magnetic particle conjugates) and identified by mass spectrum analysis. GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment analysis and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) indicated the main gene annotations and pathways of this GlcBPs, while Motif-X webtool provided the potential glucose-binding domains. Further docking analysis and glycan microarray were used to understand the interaction between the glucose and glucose-binding domains. RESULTS A total of 149 and 119 GlcBPs were identified from HV and T2DM cases. 468 GO annotations in 165 identified GlcBPs were available, while the majority involved in cellular processes and binding function. A short peptide, EGDEEITCLNGFWLE, which was derived from the Motif-X analysis, presented a high binding ability to the glucose from both docking analysis and glycan analysis.

In pancreatic cells, coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) hijacks membranes from the autophagy pathway, and in vivo disruption of acinar cell autophagy dramatically delays CVB3 replication. This is reversed by expression of GFP-LC3, indicating that CVB3 may acquire membranes from an alternative, autophagy-independent, source(s). Herein, using 3 recombinant CVB3s (rCVB3s) encoding different proteins (proLC3, proLC3(G120A), or ATG4B(C74A)), we show that CVB3 is, indeed, flexible in its utilization of cellular membranes. When compared with a control rCVB3, all 3 viruses replicated to high titers in vivo, and caused severe pancreatitis. Most importantly, each virus appeared to subvert membranes in a unique manner. The proLC3 virus produced a large quantity of LC3-I which binds to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), affording access to the autophagy pathway. The proLC3(G120A) protein cannot attach to PE, and instead binds to the ER-resident protein SEL1L, potentially providing an autophagy-independent source of membranes. Finally, the ATG4B(C74A) protein sequestered host cell LC3-I, causing accumulation of immature phagophores, and massive membrane rearrangement. Taken together, our data indicate that some RNA viruses can exploit a variety of different intracellular membranes, potentially maximizing their replication in each of the diverse cell types that they infect in vivo.","Alirezaei, Mehrdad; Flynn, Claudia T; Wood, Malcolm R; Harkins, Stephanie; Whitton, J Lindsay",Autophagy,436,1

Using computational fluid dynamics, we evaluated the hemodynamic patterns of VFAs after stent-only treatment (SOT) and monitored hemodynamic changes in the side branches. METHODS Between September 2014 and December 2015, we enrolled 10 consecutive patients with VFAs who underwent SOT. Successful aneurysm reconstruction is defined as perfect reconstruction of the parent artery and complete or nearly complete occlusion of the aneurysm. Otherwise, the reconstruction was considered unsuccessful. After SOT, we used computational fluid dynamics to assess hemodynamic changes in aneurysmal velocity, wall shear stress, and relative residual time (RRT) as well as velocity in side branches. RESULTS Ten patients were studied. At follow-up after initial treatment, 7 of the 10 reconstructions were successful. Compared with the 3 unsuccessful reconstructions, successful reconstructions showed a significantly greater increase in the mean RRT (1185.1% vs. 204.8%; P = 0.030) and a greater reduction in mean velocity (44.5% vs. 34.7%; P = 0.053) and wall shear stress (49.2% vs. 27.9%; P = 0.087). The average velocity in the branches decreased by 10.0% after SOT. There was also a significant difference between the mean reduction in the rate of flow velocity in the aneurysm and the side branches (42.1% vs. 10.0%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS We found a significant increase in RRT of successful reconstruction of aneurysms. There may be less effect on the flow in branches arising from VFAs after SOT, whether the aneurysms showed complete occlusion or not.","Li, Wenqiang; Liu, Jian; Zhang, Yisen; Wang, Kun; Tian, Zhongbin; Zhang, Qianqian; Jiang, Chuhan; Yang, Xinjian; Wang, Yang",World neurosurgery,436,26

Standard treatment involves immediate excision of all necrotic tissue, aggressive antibiotic coverage, and supportive medical care. Still, the infection is commonly fatal or disfiguring. Wound treatment with disinfected blowfly larvae (maggot debridement therapy or MDT) has been shown to be highly effective, with multiple studies demonstrating effective debridement, disinfection, and promotion of granulation tissue. MDT also has been associated with preservation of viable tissue and minimised blood loss. This report describes a prospective clinical study of MDT for Fournier's gangrene aimed to test the hypothesis that early use of maggots could decrease the number of surgical treatments required to treat Fournier's gangrene. Subjects were provided with one initial surgical excision, followed by debridement using only medical grade Lucilia sericata larvae. Only two subjects were enrolled, both diabetic men. Intensive care and culture-directed antimicrobial coverage were administered as usual. Maggot debridement was associated with the disappearance of necrotic tissue, control of infection and granulation tissue growth. In both subjects, wounds healed without requiring further surgical resection or anatomical reconstruction.

The aim of the present study was to describe patient experiences with this procedure. METHODS A qualitative, descriptive design was used and patients were recruited from three county hospitals and one university hospital in Sweden. Data was collected by semi-structured interviews with 13 patients who underwent awake fiberoptic intubation. A qualitative content analysis extracted theme, categories, and subcategories. RESULTS From the patient statements, one main theme emerged, feelings of being in a vulnerable situation but cared for in safe hands, which were described in five categories with 15 subcategories. The categories were: a need for tailored information, distress and fear of the intubation, acceptance and trust of the staff's competence, professional caring and support, and no hesitation about new awake intubation. The patients felt they lacked information about what to expect and relied on the professionals' expertise. Some patients felt overwhelmed by the information they were given and wanted less specific information about the equipment used but more information about how they would be cared for in the operating room. Undergoing awake intubation was an acceptable experience for most patients, whereas others experienced it as being painful and terrifying because they felt they could not breathe or communicate during the procedure itself. CONCLUSIONS Tailored information about what to expect, ensuring eye contact and breathing instruction during the procedure seems to reduce patient distress when undergoing awake fiberoptic intubation. Most of the patients would not hesitate to undergo awake intubation again in the future if needed.","Knudsen, Kati; Nilsson, Ulrica; Högman, Marieann; Pöder, Ulrika",BMC anesthesiology,436,1

STUDY DESIGN Anatomical study. METHODS Six latex-injected adult cadaver heads were dissected in five consecutive approaches: transcervical approach with submandibular gland removal, posterior extension of the transcervical approach, transcervical approach with parotidectomy, parotidectomy with lateral mandibulotomy, and parotidectomy with mandibulectomy. The degree of carotid artery exposure attained, external carotid branches, and lower cranial nerves visualized was documented. RESULTS The transcervical approach exposed 1.5 cm (Standard Deviation (SD) 0.5) of internal carotid artery (ICA) and 1.25 cm (SD 0.25) of external carotid artery (ECA). The superior thyroid and facial arteries and cranial nerve XII and XI were identified. The posterior extension exposed 2.9 cm (SD 0.7) of ICA and 2.7 cm (SD 1.0) of ECA. Occipital and ascending pharyngeal arteries were visualized. The transparotid approach exposed 4.0 cm (SD 1.1) of ICA and 3.98 cm (SD 1.8) of ECA. Lateral mandibulotomy exposed the internal maxillary artery, cranial nerve X, the sympathetic trunk, and 4.6 cm (SD 2.4) of ICA. Mandibulectomy allowed for complete ECA exposure, cranial nerve IX, lingual nerve, and 6.9 cm (SD 1.3) of ICA.

There has been a significant increase in our understanding of the pathologic, genetic, cellular and molecular mechanisms of asthma. Nonetheless, the contribution of microbes to the genesis, exacerbation and treatment of asthma are poorly understood. SUMMARY Asthma is a complex chronic disease of the lung whose incidence is growing at all ages despite the progress that has been made in the areas of diagnosis and treatment of asthma. The complexity is partly due to the environmental insults such as allergens and microbial infections that play differential roles in the pathogenesis of childhood vis-à-vis elderly asthma.

Ophthalmologists are at high risk of acquiring and transmitting the virus. Telemedicine platforms have evolved and may play an important role in attenuating this risk. For patients, these platforms provide the possibility of clinic consultation without the concerns of a clinic visit. We aimed to assess the utilization of telemedicine by oculoplastics specialists worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A 13-item survey was distributed internationally to practicing oculoplastic surgeons. Collected data included demographics, clinical practice variables and perceptions regarding telemedicine. Significance of associations and single survey items was evaluated by Chi-squared and z-score of proportions tests, respectively. RESULTS The questionnaire was completed by 70 oculoplastic surgeons (54.3% male, mean age 47.3 years, median experience 10 years) from eight countries, practicing in various clinical settings (50.0% hospitals, 45.7% private clinics, 4.3% community clinics). Most respondents reported telemedicine to be an effective tool for oculoplastic consultations (67.1%, p = 0.004), while only 12.8% (p < 0.00001) had incorporated this modality into clinical practice prior to the pandemic. Even though a vast majority (98.6%) of participants had limited outpatient activity, most (55.7%) felt unprotected from the virus. Telemedicine had been incorporated by 70.5% (p = 0.001) of respondents during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas most (57.1%) predicted continued use of the modality. CONCLUSION Telemedicine can be effectively and rapidly incorporated into the clinical practice of oculoplastic surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research into the most effective utilization of these platforms appears warranted.","Assayag, Elishai; Tsessler, Maria; Wasser, Lauren M; Drabkin, Elena; Reich, Ehud; Weill, Yishay; Zadok, David; Nair, Akshay Gopintathan; Andron, Aleza",European journal of ophthalmology,436,33

Stoma formation through the rectus muscle is complicated by parastomal herniation in up to 50% of cases. There is no conclusive evidence that alternative techniques (e.g. extraperitoneal, lateral rectus abdominis positioned stoma) are superior. Open and laparoscopic parastomal hernia repair have similar recurrence rates up to 50%. The 'Sugarbaker' technique appears to be superior to the 'keyhole' technique when a laparoscopic approach is used. Prophylactic mesh reinforcement of the stoma trephine appears to reduce the herniation rate to approximately 15% and is accompanied by a decrease in symptomatic hernias requiring repair without any difference in stoma-related morbidity. CONCLUSION Large prospective controlled trials are required to compare surgical techniques of stoma formation in reducing the incidence of parastomal herniation. Despite limited evidence, routine prophylactic mesh reinforcement of the stoma trephine should be offered to all patients undergoing permanent stoma formation.","Hotouras, A; Murphy, J; Thaha, M; Chan, C L",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,436,10

Extension has not only been an audience for Agricultural Safety and Health Center work, but also an essential partner in promoting evidence-based farm health and safety in communities. This commentary stems from a collaborative effort among Center leaders across the nation who developed a set of surveys to explore the ways COVID-19 has affected Extension professionals. Preliminary data gathered from across the nation suggest that while many Extension professionals feel prepared to address challenges from the pandemic and are well supported by their State and Center's resources, over half also reported moderate to great difficulty in balancing personal and professional needs and, to a lesser extent, balancing remote work and family needs. Because Extension professionals act as connectors between Agricultural Safety and Health Centers and farmers and their families, they serve in a role similar to first-responders. COVID-19 has exacerbated the potential for anxiety, stress, and other mental health concerns among this group. With COVID-19 numbers rising at an especially fast rate among agricultural workers, it is important to attend to the wellbeing of the professionals who work with them.","Sampson, Shannon; Mazur, Joan; Israel, Glenn; Galindo, Sebastian; Ward, Cassandra",Journal of agromedicine,436,1

It is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in young children. The intense inflammatory process has a predilection for the coronary arteries, resulting in the development of aneurysmal lesions, arterial thrombotic occlusion or, potentially, sudden death. There is no specific diagnostic test; however, treatment with immunoglobulin and aspirin effectively reduces cardiac complications from 25% to 4.7% in the UK. Inflammation of the myocardium, endocardium or pericardium can occur early in the disease and endothelial dysfunction along with abnormalities of myocardial blood flow may require continuing medication, interventional catheterisation or even cardiac surgery.

To enhance the therapeutic potential of curcumin against heart failure, we produced a series of synthetic curcumin analogues and investigated their inhibitory activity against p300-HAT. The compound with the strongest activity was further evaluated to determine its effects on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and pressure overload-induced heart failure in mice. We synthesised five synthetic curcumin analogues and found that a compound we have named GO-Y030 most strongly inhibited p300-HAT activity. Furthermore, 1 μM GO-Y030, in a manner equivalent to 10 µM curcumin, suppressed phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic responses in cultured cardiomyocytes. In mice undergoing transverse aortic constriction surgery, administration of GO-Y030 at a mere 1% of an equivalently-effective dose of curcumin significantly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction. In addition, this low dose of GO-Y030 almost completely blocked histone H3K9 acetylation and eliminated left ventricular fibrosis.

Phosphorus-rich foods are prevalent in the American diet, and low-phosphorus foods, including fruits and vegetables, are often less available in areas with more poverty. The relative contributions of neighborhood food availability and socioeconomic status to phosphorus control in patients receiving dialysis are unknown. METHODS Using longitudinal data from a national dialysis provider, we constructed hierarchical, linear mixed-effects models to evaluate the relationships between neighborhood food environment or socioeconomic status and serum phosphorus level among patients receiving incident dialysis. RESULTS Our cohort included 258,510 patients receiving chronic hemodialysis in 2005-2013. Median age at dialysis initiation was 64 years, 45% were female, 32% were Black, and 15% were Hispanic. Within their residential zip code, patients had a median of 25 ""less-healthy"" food outlets (interquartile range, 11-40) available to them compared with a median of four ""healthy"" food outlets (interquartile range, 2-6). Living in a neighborhood with better availability of healthy food was not associated with a lower phosphorus level. Neighborhood income also was not associated with differences in phosphorus. Patient age, race, cause of ESKD, and mean monthly dialysis duration were most closely associated with phosphorus level. CONCLUSIONS Neither neighborhood availability of healthy food options nor neighborhood income was associated with phosphorus levels in patients receiving chronic dialysis. Modifying factors, such as nutrition literacy, individual-level financial resources, and adherence to diet restrictions and medications, may be more powerful contributors than food environment to elevated phosphorus.","Potluri, Vishnu S; Sawinski, Deirdre; Tam, Vicky; Shults, Justine; Cohen, Jordana B; Wiebe, Douglas J; Shah, Siddharth P; Berns, Jeffrey S; Reese, Peter P",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,436,1

Although we know that aminopeptidase N (APN) is important for PDCoV replication, it is unclear whether it is the primary functional receptor, and the mechanism by which it promotes viral replication is not fully understood. Here, we systematically investigated the role of porcine APN (pAPN) during PDCoV infection of non-susceptible cells, including in viral attachment and internalization. Using a viral entry assay, we found that PDCoV can enter non-susceptible cells but then fails to initiate efficient replication. pAPN and PDCoV virions clearly co-localized with the endocytotic markers RAB5, RAB7, and LAMP1, suggesting that pAPN mediates PDCoV entry by an endocytotic pathway. Most importantly, our study shows that regardless of which receptor PDCoV engages, only entry by an endocytotic route ultimately leads to efficient viral replication. This knowledge should contribute to the development of efficient antiviral treatments, which are especially useful in preventing cross-species transmission. IMPORTANCE PDCoV is a pathogen with potential for transmission across diverse species, although the mechanism of such host-switching events (from swine to other species) is poorly understood. Here, we show that PDCoV enters non-susceptible cells, but without efficient replication. We also investigated the key role played by aminopeptidase N in mediating PDCoV entry via an endocytotic pathway. Our results demonstrate that viral entry via endocytosis is a major determinant of efficient PDCoV replication. This knowledge provides a basis for future studies of the cross-species transmissibility of PDCoV and the development of appropriate anti-viral drugs.","Yang, Yue-Lin; Liu, Jianbo; Wang, Tong-Yun; Chen, Meng; Wang, Gang; Yang, Yong-Bo; Geng, Xin; Sun, Ming-Xia; Meng, Fandan; Tang, Yan-Dong; Feng, Li",Journal of virology,436,16

This review synthesizes the literature on COVID-19 pharmacotherapy to inform practice and policymaking. AREAS COVERED The authors systematically review the published literature on COVID-19 therapeutics, grouping candidate treatments into repurposed, adjunct, and experimental agents. They conducted meta-analysis where appropriate and provide recommendations based on compilation from real-time/interim therapeutic guidelines. They then advise on how to navigate and advance the evidence in the current context of uncertainty and urgency and provide expert opinion on suggested framework. EXPERT OPINION Current evidence does not support a clear role for pharmacotherapy in COVID-19. While promising signals have been found through limited number of RCTs, these must be interpreted with caution. Without proper protection from bias and confounding we risk exposing patients to treatments where the potential for benefit is at best unclear, yet the potential for harm from adverse effects is high leading to a trade-off dilemma in decision making. Advancing the evidence requires a coordinated effort to design and conduct robust trials and to systematically synthesize and critically evaluate findings. Therapies should be reserved for use in clinical trials, emergency or compassionate access until we gain more confidence in the balance of benefit and harm.","Khan, Sohil; Gionfriddo, Michael R; Cortes-Penfield, Nicolas; Thunga, Girish; Rashid, Muhammad",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,436,1

From the point of view of statistical physics and complex-systems modeling this is not an unexpected outcome, nevertheless, strong empirical evidence is also necessary to support such a claim. Reanalyzing previous data, we find that, although the fatality distribution may be compatible with a power-law tail, these results are not conclusive, and other distributions, not fat-tailed, could explain the data equally well.

Associations between mayoral officials' opinions about health disparities in their city and the magnitude of life expectancy disparity in their city are not moderated by the social or fiscal ideology of mayoral officials or the ideology of their constituents. Highly visible and publicized information about mortality disparities, such as that related to COVID-19 disparities, has potential to elevate elected officials' perceptions of the severity of health disparities and influence their opinions about the issue. CONTEXT A substantive body of research has explored what factors influence elected officials' opinions about health issues. However, no studies have assessed the potential influence of the health of an elected official's constituents. We assessed whether the magnitude of income-based life expectancy disparity within a city was associated with the opinions of that city's mayoral official (i.e., mayor or deputy mayor) about health disparities in their city. METHODS The independent variable was the magnitude of income-based life expectancy disparity in US cities. The magnitude was determined by linking 2010-2015 estimates of life expectancy and median household income for 8,434 census tracts in 224 cities. The dependent variables were mayoral officials' opinions from a 2016 survey about the existence and fairness of health disparities in their city (n = 224, response rate 30.3%). Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for characteristics of mayoral officials (e.g., ideology) and city characteristics. FINDINGS In cities in the highest income-based life expectancy disparity quartile, 50.0% of mayoral officials ""strongly agreed"" that health disparities existed and 52.7% believed health disparities were ""very unfair."" In comparison, among mayoral officials in cities in the lowest disparity quartile 33.9% ""strongly agreed"" that health disparities existed and 22.2% believed the disparities were ""very unfair."" A 1-year-larger income-based life expectancy disparity in a city was associated with 25% higher odds that the city's mayoral official would ""strongly agree"" that health disparities existed (odds ratio [OR] = 1.25; P = .04) and twice the odds that the city's mayoral official would believe that such disparities were ""very unfair"" (OR = 2.24; P <.001).

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We evaluated medical records of 274 consecutive patients discharged with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke between December 2, 2010, and June 11, 2012, at the University of California Irvine Medical Center. Mean (SE) patient age was 67.2 (0.8) years. Data analysis was conducted from July 3, 2014, to August 4, 2015. EXPOSURES Medical records were systematically examined for demographic information, stroke risk factors, stroke severity, and acute stroke treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We defined stroke preventability as the degree to which the patient's presenting stroke was preventable. Using variables easily determined at onset of stroke, we developed a 10-point scale (0, not preventable; 10, most preventable) to classify the degree of stroke preventability. Our focus was effectiveness of treatment of hypertension (0-2 points), hyperlipidemia (0-2 points), and atrial fibrillation (0-4 points), as well as use of antithrombotic treatment for known prior cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease (0-2 points). RESULTS Total risk scores ranged from 0 to 8 (mean [SE], 2.2 [0.1]), with 207 patients (75.5%) exhibiting some degree of preventability (score of 1 or higher). Seventy-one patients (25.9%) had scores of 4 or higher, indicating that the stroke was highly preventable. Severity of stroke as determined by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was not related to preventability of stroke. However, 21 of 71 patients (29.6%) whose stroke was highly preventable were treated with intravenous or intra-arterial acute stroke therapy while these treatments were provided for only 13 of 67 patients (19.4%) with scores of 0 (no preventability) and 19 of 136 patients (14.0%) with scores of 1 to 3 (low preventability) (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most patients with acute stroke exhibited some degree of preventability. Preventability and treatment of stroke were significantly associated, indicating that the most preventable strokes paradoxically were more likely to receive acute treatment.","Fisher, Mark; Moores, Lisa; Alsharif, Mohamad N; Paganini-Hill, Annlia",JAMA neurology,436,1

Therefore, the aim of this study described here was to develop and validate novel SARS-CoV-2 proteins binding human mRNAs (SPBRs) signature to predict overall survival (OS) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using multivariate Cox regression analysis, a set of SPBRs was identified to establish a multigene signature in the Cancer Genome Atlas repositories cohort. Furthermore, a nomogram was established based on the signature and clinical risk factors to improve risk stratification for individual patients. External validation was performed in the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) cohort. A six-SPBR signature was built to classify patients into two risk groups using a risk score with different OS in two cohorts (all p < 0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated the signature was an independent predictor of HCC. Moreover, the signature presented an excellent diagnostic power in differentiating HCC and normal tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that high-risk group was closely enriched in cell cycle, DNA replication, microRNAs in cancer, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. The novel signature demonstrated great clinical value in predicting the OS for patients with HCC, and will provide a good reference between cancer research and SARS-CoV-2 and help individualized treatment in HCC.","Chen, Shimin",DNA and cell biology,436,1

Open components separation has widely been applied to obtain closure of the midline and recently a minimally invasive technique has been introduced (endoscopic components separation). The effectiveness and safety of endoscopic components separation have been demonstrated in previous reports, whereas little is known about quality of life in these patients. With a focus on quality of life, we present the first patients from our center operated on with endoscopic components separation. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 19 consecutive patients scheduled for open hernia repair with endoscopic components separation from October 2010 to June 2012 were included. All procedures included endoscopic components separation because of the hernia size. Demographic data, operative information, and postoperative complications were recorded. All patients completed two similar questionnaires regarding their function level, cosmetic satisfaction, analgesic medication, alcohol consumption, and self-estimated physical and mental health before and after the hernia repair. Patients were assessed as outpatient median 2 months and 16 months after operation for exclusion of hernia recurrence and completion of the postoperative questionnaire. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Operating room time was median 204 min and correlated significantly with the hernia size. A total of 21 postoperative complications occurred in 14 patients. The length of stay was median 6 days and correlated significantly with duration of the operation. Of these, 15 patients participated in late follow-up visit. Two patients experienced recurrent hernias. Postoperative function level, cosmetic satisfaction, and self-estimated physical and mental health improved significantly. Alcohol consumption was significantly reduced. Endoscopic components separation is a reliable method to repair large ventral hernias, although further studies are required to determine the exact benefits for endoscopic components separation hernia repair versus conventional hernia repair.","Thomsen, C Ø; Brøndum, T L; Jørgensen, L N",Scandinavian journal of surgery : SJS : official organ for the Finnish Surgical Society and the Scandinavian Surgical Society,436,25

METHODS A Markov model was developed to simulate health outcomes and costs of two therapies over a lifetime time horizon: stent-retriever thrombectomy in combination with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV t-PA), and IV t-PA alone. The model incorporated an acute phase (0-90 days) and a rest of life phase (90+ days). Health states were defined by the modified Rankin Scale score. During the rest of life phase, patients remained in the same health state until a recurrent stroke or death. Clinical effectiveness and safety data were taken from the SWIFT PRIME study. Resource use and health state utilities were informed by published data. RESULTS Combined stent-retriever thrombectomy and IV t-PA led to improved quality-of-life and increased life expectancy compared to IV t-PA alone. The higher treatment costs associated with the use of stent-retriever thrombectomy were offset by long-term cost savings due to improved patient health status, leading to overall cost savings of £33 190 per patient and a net benefit of £79 402. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results were robust to a wide range of parameter inputs. LIMITATIONS The acute and long-term costs resource use data were taken from a study based on a patient population that was older and may have had additional comorbidities than the SWIFT PRIME population, resulting in costs that may not be representative of the cohort within this model. In addition, the estimates may not reflect stroke care today as no current evidence is available; however, the cost estimates were deemed reasonable by clinical opinion. CONCLUSIONS Combined stent-retriever neurothrombectomy and IV t-PA is a cost-effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke compared with IV t-PA alone.","Lobotesis, Kyriakos; Veltkamp, Roland; Carpenter, Isobel H; Claxton, Lindsay M; Saver, Jeffrey L; Hodgson, Robert",Journal of medical economics,436,14

Casearia sylvestris is a plant used topically in different communities in Brazil, to treat wounds or promote cutaneous healing. To evaluate the topical anti-inflammatory activity for the crude hydroalcoholic extract of Casearia sylvestris (HCE-CS) in the models of single or multipe administration of chroton oil to induce ear edema in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental study using male Swiss mice (25-35g) kept under constant conditions in the Laboratory of Experimental Neuroscience (LaNEx)-UNISUL. Edema was induced in both models, respectively, by the single or multiple application of croton oil (CO, 2.5%, in 20μl) on the external surface of the ear. The different groups of animals (n= 8) received different treatments: vehicle, dexamethasone (DEXA) or different doses of HCE-CS. Edema was evaluated macroscopically for 6 h (early edema) or 8 days (late edema) after the first application of the CO and immediately after the animals were submitted to euthanasia for the collection of the samples (treated ears). For early edema, the tissue was biochemically evaluated for myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) and levels of nitrite/nitrate. In the late edema model, the ears were histologically evaluated for general morphometry, degranulated and non-degranulated mast cells, as well as acanthosis. RESULTS Topic treatment with HCE-CS significantly reduced the early and late edema, as well as MPO activity and tissue levels of nitrite/nitrate. Finally, in the late edema model there was a lower density of degranulated mast cells in relation to the vehicle treated group and decreased thickness of the epidermis (acanthosis). CONCLUSION These results suggest a possible benefit of topical treatment with HCE-CS in inflammatory conditions of the skin.","Heymanns, Ana Caroline; Albano, Micheline N; da Silveira, Márcia R; Muller, Simony D; Petrnilho, Fabrícia C; Gainski, Lucinéia D; Cargnin-Ferreira, Eduardo; Piovezan, Anna P",Journal of ethnopharmacology,436,16

Among those, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are extremely versatile and, therefore, widely prescribed. Moreover, they are commonly considered as having a better safety profile compared to other antidepressants. For these reasons, when it comes to off-label prescribing, SSRIs rank among the top positions. In this review, we present the state of the art of off-label applications of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, ranging from migraine prophylaxis to SARS-CoV-2 antiviral properties. Research on SSRIs provided significant evidence in the treatment of premature ejaculation, both with the on-label dapoxetine 30 mg and the off-label paroxetine 20 mg. However, other than serotoninergic syndrome, serious conditions like increased bleeding rates, hyponatremia, hepatoxicity, and post-SSRIs sexual dysfunctions, are consistently more prominent when using such compounds. These insidious side effects might be frequently underestimated during common clinical practice, especially by non-psychiatrists. For this reason, some points must be addressed when using SSRIs. Among these, a psychiatric evaluation before every administration that falls outside the regulatory agencies-approved guidelines has to be considered mandatory. For these reasons, we aim with the present article to identify the risks of inappropriate uses and to advocate the need to actively boost research encouraging future clinical trials on this topic.","Jannini, Tommaso B; Di Lorenzo, Giorgio; Bianciardi, Emanuela; Niolu, Cinzia; Toscano, Massimiliano; Ciocca, Giacomo; Jannini, Emmanuele A; Siracusano, Alberto",Current neuropharmacology,436,30

Despite similar clinical goals, the outcomes and endpoints used in these trials are broad and not well standardized. OBJECTIVE To describe results from a systematic literature review focused on outcomes and endpoints used in preventive migraine clinical trials. METHOD A systematic literature review, following a pre-specified (unregistered) protocol developed to adhere to recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, was conducted to characterize the endpoints and outcomes used in preventive migraine clinical trials. Predetermined terms were searched in PubMed on October 28, 2019. Data related to trial design, subject characteristics, outcomes, and endpoints reported in each publication were extracted. Descriptive summaries of these features were tabulated for the recent subset of publications, published during or after 1988, that were randomized, blinded, and focused on pharmacological or device therapies for the preventive treatment of migraine. RESULTS The initial literature search identified 1506 publications, of which 757 publications were eligible for data extraction. Of specific clinical interest were the recent subset of 268 articles (268/757, 35.4%) fulfilling the targeted criteria. Results showed that the outcomes used to define endpoints varied substantially across publications. For example, in the recent subset of publications, 68.7% (184/268) of the publications examined ≥1 migraine-specific outcome, 39.6% (106/268) examined ≥1 headache-specific outcome, 50.7% (136/268) examined ≥1 acute/rescue medication use outcome, 40.3% (108/268) examined ≥1 headache-related patient-reported outcome measure (PROM), and 22.0% (59/268) examined ≥1 non-headache-specific PROM. Furthermore, the definition of the endpoints used (e.g., change from baseline, fixed timepoint comparisons, categorization of ""responders"" to treatment based on wide variety of ""responder definitions"") also differed across publications. CONCLUSION Publications from clinical trials of preventive migraine pharmacologic and device treatments differed in terms of study design, endpoint definitions, and how endpoints and outcomes were measured. Although there were common outcomes and endpoints used across publications, no clear ""standardized"" set of endpoints and outcomes emerged. The inconsistencies in endpoints and outcomes within this literature suggest that the development of a uniform set of outcomes and endpoints could improve the clinical meaningfulness of clinical trial results, facilitate cross-trial comparisons and better inform patient care. This standard set of outcomes and endpoints should be statistically robust and informed by the priorities of various stakeholders, most importantly, the needs and preferences of people living with migraine.","McGinley, James S; Houts, Carrie R; Nishida, Tracy K; Buse, Dawn C; Lipton, Richard B; Goadsby, Peter J; Dodick, David W; Wirth, R J",Headache,436,1

Although most often used in the laboratory it has seen increasing application under field conditions. Air is drawn or pushed through a metabolic chamber or the nest with the animal, and the O2 depletion and/or CO2 accumulation in the air is analysed to calculate metabolic rate and energy expenditure. Under field conditions, animals are often measured within the microclimate of their nest and in contrast to laboratory work, the temperature of the air entering the nest cannot be controlled. Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the explanatory power of respirometry in a set-up mimicking field conditions. We measured O2 consumption of 14 laboratory mice (Mus musculus) using three different flow rates [50 L*h-1 (834 mL*min-1), 60 L*h-1 (1000 mL*min-1) and 70 L*h-1 (1167 mL*min-1)] and two different temperatures of the inflowing air; either the same as the temperature inside the metabolic chamber (no temperature differential; 20 °C), or cooler (temperature differential of 10 °C). Our results show that the energy expenditure of the mice did not change significantly in relation to a cooler airflow, nor was it affected by different flow rates, despite a slight, but significant decrease of about 1.5 °C in chamber temperature with the cooler airflow. Our study emphasises the validity of the results obtained by open-flow respirometry when investigating energy budgets and physiological responses of animals to ambient conditions. Nevertheless, subtle changes in chamber temperature in response to changes in the temperature and flow rate of the air pulled or pushed through the system were detectable. Thus, constant airflow during open-flow respirometry and consequent changes in nest/chamber temperature should be measured.","Nowack, Julia; Dill, Veronika; Dausmann, Kathrin H",Journal of thermal biology,436,30

We investigated the yield of digital subtraction angiography among patients with SAH or intraventricular hemorrhage and a negative CTA. MATERIALS AND METHODS An 11-year, single-center retrospective review of all consecutive patients with CTA-negative SAH was performed. Noncontrast head CT, CTA, DSA, and MR imaging studies were reviewed by 2 experienced interventional neuroradiologists and 1 neuroradiologist. RESULTS Two hundred thirty patients (mean age, 54 years; 51% male) with CTA-negative SAH were identified. The pattern of SAH was diffuse (40%), perimesencephalic (31%), sulcal (31%), isolated IVH (6%), or identified by xanthochromia (7%). Initial DSA yield was 13%, including vasculitis/vasculopathy (7%), aneurysm (5%), arteriovenous malformation (0.5%), and dural arteriovenous fistula (0.5%). An additional 6 aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms (4%) were identified by follow-up DSA, and a single cavernous malformation (0.4%) was identified by MRI. No cause of hemorrhage was identified in any patient presenting with isolated intraventricular hemorrhage or xanthochromia. Diffuse SAH was due to aneurysm rupture (17%); perimesencephalic SAH was due to aneurysm rupture (3%) or vasculitis/vasculopathy (1.5%); and sulcal SAH was due to vasculitis/vasculopathy (32%), arteriovenous malformation (3%), or dural arteriovenous fistula (3%). CONCLUSIONS DSA identifies vascular pathology in 13% of patients with CTA-negative SAH. Aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms are identified in an additional 4% of patients by repeat DSA following an initially negative DSA. All patients with CT-negative SAH should be considered for DSA. The pattern of SAH may suggest the cause of hemorrhage, and aneurysms should specifically be sought with diffuse or perimesencephalic SAH.","Heit, J J; Pastena, G T; Nogueira, R G; Yoo, A J; Leslie-Mazwi, T M; Hirsch, J A; Rabinov, J D",AJNR.

This is because such sampling measures the incidence of the disease, the key variable controlled by restrictive measures, and thus anticipates the load on the healthcare system due to progression of the disease. The frequent testing of non-symptomatic infectiousness will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates. These advantages are quantified by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where the feedback is derived from the evolution of the daily measured prevalence. While the basic model we propose aggregates data for the entire population of a country such as Switzerland, we point out generalizations which account for hot spots which are analogous to Anderson-localized regions in the theory of diffusion in random media.","Müller, Markus; Derlet, Peter M; Mudry, Christopher; Aeppli, Gabriel",Physical biology,436,29

The SILS techniques applied to cholecystectomy vary, and reporting has been sparse. Because most cholecystectomies are outpatient procedures performed by busy, practicing general surgeons, the authors report their initial experience adopting this technique. METHODS From March, 2008 to January, 2009, SILS was performed for 100 consecutive outpatients needing cholecystectomy. All the patients underwent a single-incision, multiport laparoscopic (SIMPL) technique using existing instrumentation. The patients were followed postoperatively for at least 6 months. RESULTS Of the 100 patients, 98 underwent SIMPL cholecystectomy and 2 required conversion to the standard laparoscopic technique because of bleeding from the cystic artery. No major postoperative complications occurred, including infections and hernias. CONCLUSIONS The findings show SIMPL cholecystectomy to be safe in the outpatient setting. It is an excellent alternative to traditional three- or four-port cholecystectomy for the ideal candidate with a lower body mass index (BMI), early disease, and no previous abdominal surgery. The authors' initial outpatient experience shows that it can be performed using existing instrumentation without increasing costs by a reproducible technique that can be adopted by any practicing general surgeon.","Erbella, Jose; Bunch, Gary M",Surgical endoscopy,436,27

METHODS A total of 16 breast cancers confirmed by needle biopsy in 15 patients were included in this study from October 2012 to June 2014. Under ultrasonography (US)-guidance, the surgical clips were placed prior to NAC. Additional mammography, breast US, and breast magnetic resonance examinations were performed within 10 days before surgery. The time period from marker insertion to operation date was documented. Images acquired via the three modalities were evalu-ated for the following parameters: location of clip, clip migration (>1 cm), the presence of complications from clip placement, and the effect of clips on the assessment of treatment. RESULTS The mean time period was 128.6±34.4 days (median, 132.0 days) from the date of clip insertion to the date of surgery. The mean number of inserted clips was 2.3±0.7 (median, 2.0). Clip migration was not visualized by imaging in any patient, and there were no complications reported. Surgical clips did not negatively affect the assessment of treatment responses to NAC. CONCLUSION Surgical clips may replace commercial tissue markers for tumor localization in breast cancer patients undergoing NAC without migration. Surgical clips are well tolerated and safe for the patient, easily visualized on imaging, do not interfere with treatment response, and are cost-effective.","Youn, Inyoung; Choi, Seon Hyeong; Kook, Shin Ho; Choi, Yoon Jung; Park, Chan Heun; Park, Yong Lai; Kim, Dong Hoon",Journal of breast cancer,436,17

It reduces type 2 inflammation by blocking the shared receptor subunit for IL-4 and IL-13 and thereby inhibits receptor signaling downstream the JAK-STAT-pathway. Dupilumab affects three important disease mechanisms in atopic dermatitis: the skin barrier, the Th2-cell differentiation and the class switch to IgE. This report is based on a systematic literature search of the PubMed Database. AREAS COVERED Dupilumab showed promising results in improving AD signs, symptoms and quality of life in adolescents with moderate to severe AD. The safety profile of dupilumab in adolescents with moderate to severe AD closely resembled the known safety profile of dupilumab in adults with moderate to severe AD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 70 consecutive patients with critical ischemia were treated with below the knee percutaneous transluminal angioplasty at the vascular center at Rigshospitalet with the purpose of limb salvage. All patients were deemed unfit for major surgery due to anatomical limitations or severe co-morbidity, and no prior attempts of revascularization were performed. Follow-up clinical examinations were performed within 6 weeks and after 1 year. All medical records were crosschecked with the national vascular registry ensuring a valid 1-year status in 97% of the patients. RESULTS A total of 15 major amputations were performed during follow-up, with 11 amputations performed within the first year. Complications after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty were rare. Cumulative mortality after 1 and 2 years was 22% and 34%, respectively. Amputation-free survival at 1 and 2 years of follow-up was 68% and 58%, respectively. There were no association between known risk factors such as diabetes, ischemic ulcers, cardiac disease, history of smoking, major amputation, or overall amputation. CONCLUSION Below the knee percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in patients with end-stage peripheral arterial disease and critical limb ischemia is a safe procedure in relieving critical ischemia, reducing the short-term rate of a major amputation as opposed to best medical treatment alone.","Strøm, M; Konge, L; Lönn, L; Schroeder, T V; Rørdam, P",Scandinavian journal of surgery : SJS : official organ for the Finnish Surgical Society and the Scandinavian Surgical Society,436,31

This problem is the growth of graphene on the copper surface with no carbon feedstock. A new source of undesired carbon species was identified which has not been addressed so far. The hydrogen-rich heating stage was diagnosed as the onset of the unintended nucleation for the first time owing to the determinant catalytic role of hydrogen in this stage. It was found out that this problem leads to uncontrollable growth of multilayer graphene, growth of defective graphene film and also inhibition of the reliable synthesis of monolayer graphene. We managed to grow enhanced-quality monolayer graphene by developing some innovative solutions to the problem containing a general solution based on the hydrogen effects in the heating stage. The results reveal a significant decrease in the unintended nucleation density from ~ 2000 to almost zero domains per 100 × 100 µm2 copper area. Furthermore, Raman, HRTEM and SAED analysis confirm the defect-free growth of monolayer graphene after employing the solutions. These findings could pave the way for the reliable synthesis of high-quality monolayer graphene as well as large-sized graphene domains.","Mirzaei, Maryam; Hedayat, Seyed Mahdi; Karimi-Sabet, Javad; Towfighi Darain, Jafar",Nanotechnology,436,5

In this study, we propose a novel approach using silica particles with encapsulated DNA (SPED) as a tracing agent for measuring aerosol distribution indoors. In a series of experiments with a portable setup, SPED were successfully aerosolized, re-captured and quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Position-dependency and ventilation effects within a confined space could be shown in a quantitative fashion achieving detection limits below 0.1 ng particles per m3 of sampled air. In conclusion, SPED show promise for a flexible, cost-effective and low-impact characterization of aerosol dynamics in a wide range of settings.","Luescher, A. M.; Koch, J.; Stark, W. J.; Grass, R.

Methods: This retrospective study included adult patients who tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and May 17, 2020. Demographics, labs, hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality were analyzed with SAS. Groups were defined by MS according to NCEP/ATP criteria and serum AST:ALT, TG:HDL, and uric acid. Results: Of 23282 tested patients, 3679 (16%) were COVID-positive. MS was present in 834 (39%) of 2146 positive patients with available data. Patients with MS were older, male, Black, heavier, and had more comorbidities. MS was associated with higher rates of hospital admission and death (p<0.001). On multivariable analysis, patients with MS had increased risk of hospitalization (77%), ICU admission (57%) and death (81%) relative to those without MS (p<0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, race and comorbidities, MS remained a significant predictor of outcomes. AST:ALT>1 was a predictor of hospital and ICU admission, but not mortality. Higher TG:HDL ratio and uric acid were associated with worse outcomes, but were not independent predictors. Conclusion: MS is a significant predictor of hospital and ICU admission and mortality due to COVID-19, even after adjusting for other factors. Targeting modifiable components of MS including obesity, hyperglycemia, and hypertension may reduce mortality from COVID-19.","Wu, Shannon Bena James F.; Zhou, Keren Misra-Hebert Anita D.; Kashyap, Sangeeta",Diabetes,436,2

Recent reports have estimated reduced VE with the emergence and dissemination of the B.1.617.2 variant (Delta variant). During July 2021, Multnomah County experienced an epidemic expansion coinciding with increased Delta variant prevalence. We assess COVID-19 VE during this time. Methods: A test-negative design (TND) matched case-control analysis was performed to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection during July 2021. Cases included a random sample of individuals that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were reported by electronic laboratory report, were >15 years of age, and had no prior known SARS-CoV-2 infections. Controls were age and postal code matched individuals that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 during July 2021. Immunization status was assessed using the Oregon ALERT Immunization Information system (ALERT IIS). Results: 500 case-control pairs were matched (n=1000). Overall effectiveness of any completed COVID-19 immunization was 73% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 49-86%) and 74% (95% CI 65-85%) for mRNA immunizations and 72% (95% CI 47-85%) for individuals that had started but not completed mRNA immunizations. Conclusions: Our findings estimate high, yet reduced, VE during Delta variant dissemination. These results highlight the importance of COVID-19 immunizations for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection while juxtaposing the need for additional non-pharmaceutical interventions. Importantly, the reduced VE identified here may predict future reductions in vaccine performance in the context of ongoing viral genetic drift.","Barlow, R. S.; Larson, L.; Jian, K.",,436,1

There were conflicting reports as well as unscientific opinion pieces in the scientific literature also. This study was planned to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of health-care professionals regarding HCQ. Methods: An online survey was created with 8 knowledge-based questions (n = 2 fact-based [each scoring 1], n = 6 guideline-based [each scoring 2]), and 6 attitude-based questions, and distribution among a target population of doctors was done using Google™ forms. Results: Of 115 respondents, the majority considered HCQ a safe drug (86.1%) and were in favor of its usage in COVID-19 trials (81.7%) or health-care/contact prophylaxis (60.9%) but against its use as a mass prophylactic agent (80.9%). Contrary to the published guidelines/recommendations, 80% and 55.7% of respondents opined for routine cardiac and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase evaluations before prescribing HCQ. Those who were dealing with COVID-19 patients directly (n = 41) had significantly lower knowledge score compared to the others (6.37 vs. 7.72, P = 0.007). They had significantly lesser awareness for the baseline tests recommended (97.6% vs. 77.0%, P = 0.003). A significantly higher number of these physicians opposed the use of HCQ in clinical trials (26.82% vs. 8.1%, P = 0.027) and health-care/contact prophylaxis (41.5% vs. 16.2%, P = 0.008). Conclusion: Sparse and speedily gathered information on HCQ can influence the practicing doctors, especially those involved directly in COVID-19 patient care, but less familiar with the prescription of this time-tested drug. Possibly, this has a bearing on the counseling of the patients requiring HCQ for non-COVID-19 indications and formulation of new guidelines. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Here, we established 60 total small RNA-sequencing profiles from 17 aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) patients tumor and adjacent normal tissue, and EVs isolated from urine, serum, and cancer cell culture media. We interrogated the key satellite alteration in tumor-derived EVs and found that resection of tumor prostate tissue leads to differential expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS), P53 pathways, inflammatory/cytokines, oncogenes, and tumor suppressor genes in the EV nanosatellites. Furthermore, we provide a set of novel EV-specific RNA signature, which are present in cancer but are nonexistent in post-resection patients with undetectable cancer. Finally, using a de novo RNAseq assembly followed by characterization of the small RNA landscape, we found novel small RNA clusters (smRCs) in the EVs, which reside in the unannotated regions. Novel smRCs were orthogonally validated for their differential expression in the biomarker discovery cohort using RT-qPCR. We demonstrate that circulating tumor EVs provide a glimpse of the tumor tissue biology, resolving a major bottleneck in the current liquid biopsy efforts. Secretory vesicles appear to be playing a key role in non-canonical Wnt signaling and miRNA pathways, similar to the circulating tumor cells (CTCs), hence, we propose that such vesicles be called circulating tumor extracellular vesicles (CTEVs).","Dogra, N.; Ahsen, M.

It is therefore essential to quantify airborne transmission in closed spaces and determine the recommendations that should be implemented to minimize exposure to pathogens in built environments. We have developed a method to detect viable virus particles from aerosols by using an aerosolized bacteriophage Phi6 in combination with its host Pseudomonas phaseolicola, which when seeded on agar plates acts as a virus detector that can be placed at a range of distances away from an aerosol-generating source. Based on this method we present two striking results. (1) We consistently detected viable phage particles at distances of up to 18 feet away from the source within 15-minutes of exposure in a classroom equipped with a state of the art HVAC system. (2) Increasing the relative humidity beyond 40% significantly reduces dispersal. Our method can be used to quantify the exposure to pathogens at various distances from the source for different amounts of time, data which can be used to set safety standards for room capacity and to ascertain the efficacy of interventions that aim to reduce pathogen levels in closed spaces of specified sizes and intended uses.

ANIMALS 33 specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Beagle pups (7 to 10 weeks old). PROCEDURE A canarypox virus recombinant-CDV combination vaccine was tested for safety and efficacy along with MLV components (canine adenovirus type 2, canine coronavirus, canine parainfluenza virus, and canine parvovirus) in 26 SPF Beagle pups. The combination vaccine was rehydrated with either Leptospira canicola-L icterohaemorrhagiae combination bacterin (vaccine 1) or sterile diluent (vaccine 2). An additional group of 7 seronegative SPF pups received the control MLV components devoid of the combination vaccine (vaccine 3). Two vaccinations were administered 21 days apart, either IM or SC. The dose of the combination vaccine used to inoculate these pups was 40 times lower than the recommended commercial dose. At 21 days after the booster vaccination, all pups were challenge exposed with a virulent CDV strain, then were observed for 21 days to record morbidity and mortality. RESULTS Adverse local or generalized reactions were not induced by vaccinations. All vaccinates seroconverted to CDV. Serum antibody titers to MLV components were not different, with or without inclusion of the combination vaccine. After challenge exposure, morbidity and mortality in vaccinates were 0% (0/26); in control dogs, values were 100% morbidity and 86% mortality (6/7). Brain impression smear slides made from all dogs that did not survive challenge exposure were CDV positive by use of a direct fluorescein isothiocyanate method. CONCLUSIONS The canarypox virus-CDV combination vaccine, administered SC or IM, is a safe product that elicits CDV seroconversion, does not interfere with other vaccine components, and protects vaccinated pups against virulent CDV challenge exposure.","Pardo, M C; Bauman, J E; Mackowiak, M",American journal of veterinary research,436,4

We designed a research with the objective of finding the frequency of respiratory viruses, particularly WU and KI polyomaviruses (WUPyV & KIPyV), human coronaviruses (HCoVs), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human parechovirus (HPeV) in hospitalized children who were influenza negative. Materials and Methods Throat swabs were collected from children younger than 5 years who have been hospitalized for SARI and screened for WUPyV, KIPyV, HCoVs, HRSV and HPeV using Real time PCR. Results A viral pathogen was identified in 23 (11.16%) of 206 hospitalized children with SARI. The rate of virus detection was considerably greater in infants <12 months (78.2%) than in older children (21.8%). The most frequently detected viruses were HCoVs with 7.76% of positive cases followed by KIPyV (2%) and WUPyV (1.5%). No HPeV and HRSV were detected in this study. Conclusion This research shown respiratory viruses as causes of childhood acute respiratory infections, while as most of mentioned viruses usually causes mild respiratory diseases, their frequency might be higher in outpatient children. Meanwhile as HRSV is really sensitive to inactivation due to environmental situations and its genome maybe degraded, then for future studies, we need to use fresh samples for HRSV detection. These findings addressed a need for more studies on viral respiratory tract infections to help public health.","Aghamirmohammadali, Fahimeh Sadat; Sadeghi, Kaveh; Shafiei-Jandaghi, Nazanin Zahra; Khoban, Zahra; Mokhtari-Azad, Talat; Yavarian, Jila",Iranian journal of microbiology,436,16

The aims of this study were to identify and evaluate the incidence, pathogenic etiology, and symptomatology of acute URI during a 5-month training and competition period. METHODS Thirty-two elite and 31 recreationally competitive triathletes and cyclists, and 20 sedentary controls (age range 18.0-34.1 yr) participated in a prospective surveillance study. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were collected from subjects presenting with two or more defined upper respiratory symptoms. Swabs were analyzed using microscopy, culture, and PCR testing for typical and atypical respiratory pathogens. The Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-44) was used to assess symptomatology and functional impairment. RESULTS Thirty-seven URI episodes were reported in 28 subjects. Incidence rate ratios for illness were higher in both the control subjects (1.93, 95% CI: 0.72-5.18) and elite athletes (4.50, 1.91-10.59) than in the recreationally competitive athletes. Infectious agents were identified in only 11 (two control, three recreationally competitive, and six elite) out of 37 illness episodes. Rhinovirus was the most common respiratory pathogen isolated. Symptom and functional impairment severity scores were higher in subjects with an infectious pathogen episode, particularly on illness days 3-4. CONCLUSION The results confirm a higher rate of URI among elite athletes than recreationally competitive athletes during this training and competition season. However, because pathogens were isolated in fewer than 30% of URI cases, further study is required to uncover the causes of unidentified but symptomatic URI in athletes. Despite the common perception that all URI are infections, physicians should consider both infectious and noninfectious causes when athletes present with symptoms.","Spence, Luke; Brown, Wendy J; Pyne, David B; Nissen, Michael D; Sloots, Theo P; McCormack, Joseph G; Locke, A Simon; Fricker, Peter A",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,436,17

It has the advantage of achieving very high antibiotic concentrations in affected tissues. This technique was used to clinically resolve deep, mixed infections involving bones and joints in a swamp wallaby and a lesser kudu. Both infections were severe and considered life-threatening, because amputation was not feasible, systemic antibiotic treatment had failed, and both animals were in pain and had evidence of the systemic effects of the infections. In the wallaby, once daily treatments with imipenem for 5 days resulted in a return to normal function within 1 mo. In the kudu, four treatments using both ampicillin/sulbactam followed by enrofloxacin were performed every 2 days, followed by two treatments with ampicillin/sulbactam alone 2 wk later. Resolution of this case was achieved in less than 2 mo. The only adverse effect noted was phlebitis in the kudu, which resolved with conservative therapy. Healing was rapid in both cases and was apparent after two treatments.

The broad-spectrum inhibitors cathepsin inhibitor III and E-64d gave comparable dose-dependent inhibition of Moloney MLV Env and VSV G pseudotypes, suggesting that the decrease did not involve the envelope protein. Whereas, CA-074 Me gave a biphasic response that differentiated between Moloney MLV Env and VSV G at low concentrations, at which the drug is highly selective for cathepsin B, but was similar for both glycoproteins at higher concentrations, at which CA-074 Me inhibits other cathepsins. Moloney MLV infection was lower on cathepsin B knockout fibroblasts than wild-type cells, whereas VSV G infection was not reduced on the B-/- cells. Taken together, these results support the notion that cathepsin B acts at an envelope-dependent step while another cathepsin acts at an envelope-independent step, such as uncoating or viral-DNA synthesis. Virus binding was not affected by CA-074 Me, whereas syncytium induction was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with cathepsin B involvement in membrane fusion. Western blot analysis revealed specific cathepsin B cleavage of SU in vitro, while TM and CA remained intact. Infection could be enhanced by preincubation of Moloney MLV with cathepsin B, consistent with SU cleavage potentiating infection. These data suggested that during infection of NIH 3T3 cells, endocytosis brings Moloney MLV to early lysosomes, where the virus encounters cellular proteases, including cathepsin B, that cleave SU.","Kumar, Pankaj; Nachagari, Deepa; Fields, Carolyn; Franks, John; Albritton, Lorraine M",Journal of virology,436,24

However, pulse oximetry has impaired accuracy in certain patient groups, and data are lacking on its accuracy in patients with COVID-19 stepping down from intensive care unit (ICU) to non-ICU settings or being transferred to another ICU. METHODS: We assessed the bias, precision and limits of agreement using 90 paired SpO2 and SaO2 from 30 patients (3 paired samples per patient). To assess the agreement between pulse oximetry (SpO2) and arterial blood gas analysis (SaO2) in patients with COVID-19, deemed clinically stable to step down from an ICU to a non-ICU ward, or be transferred to another ICU. This was done to evaluate whether the guidelines were appropriate for our setting. RESULTS: Mean difference between SaO2 and SpO2 (bias) was 0.4%, with an SD of 2.4 (precision). The limits of agreement between SpO2 and SaO2 were as follows: upper limit of 5.2% (95% CI 6.5% to 4.2%) and lower limit of -4.3% (95% CI -3.4% to -5.7%). CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, pulse oximetry showed a level of agreement with SaO2 measurement that was slightly suboptimal, although within acceptable levels for Food and Drug Authority approval, in people with COVID-19 judged clinically ready to step down from ICU to a non-ICU ward, or who were being transferred to another hospital's ICU. In such patients, SpO2 should be interpreted with caution. Arterial blood gas assessment of SaO2 may still be clinically indicated.","Philip, Keir Elmslie James; Bennett, Benjamin; Fuller, Silas; Lonergan, Bradley; McFadyen, Charles; Burns, Janis; Tidswell, Robert; Vlachou, Aikaterini",,436,24

METHODS: In this simulation study, we developed a microsimulation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a cohort of 100 000 US domestic airline travellers using publicly available data on COVID-19 clinical cases and published natural history parameters to assign individuals one of five health states of susceptible to infection, latent period, early infection, late infection, or recovered. We estimated a per-day risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 corresponding to a daily incidence of 150 infections per 100 000 people. We assessed five testing strategies: (1) anterior nasal PCR test within 3 days of departure, (2) PCR within 3 days of departure and 5 days after arrival, (3) rapid antigen test on the day of travel (assuming 90% of the sensitivity of PCR during active infection), (4) rapid antigen test on the day of travel and PCR test 5 days after arrival, and (5) PCR test 5 days after arrival. Strategies 2 and 4 included a 5-day quarantine after arrival. The travel period was defined as 3 days before travel to 2 weeks after travel. Under each scenario, individuals who tested positive before travel were not permitted to travel. The primary study outcome was cumulative number of infectious days in the cohort over the travel period without isolation or quarantine (population-level transmission risk), and the key secondary outcome was the number of infectious people detected on the day of travel (passenger risk of infection). FINDINGS: We estimated that in a cohort of 100 000 airline travellers, in a scenario with no testing or screening, there would be 8357 (95% uncertainty interval 6144-12831) infectious days with 649 (505-950) actively infectious passengers on the day of travel. The pre-travel PCR test reduced the number of infectious days from 8357 to 5401 (3917-8677), a reduction of 36% (29-41) compared with the base case, and identified 569 (88% [76-92]) of 649 actively infectious travellers on the day of flight; the addition of post-travel quarantine and PCR reduced the number of infectious days to 2520 days (1849-4158), a reduction of 70% (64-75) compared with the base case. The rapid antigen test on the day of travel reduced the number of infectious days to 5674 (4126-9081), a reduction of 32% (26-38) compared with the base case, and identified 560 (86% [83-89]) actively infectious travellers; the addition of post-travel quarantine and PCR reduced the number of infectious days to 3124 (2356-495), a reduction of 63% (58-66) compared with the base case. The post-travel PCR alone reduced the number of infectious days to 4851 (3714-7679), a reduction of 42% (35-49) compared with the base case. INTERPRETATION: Routine asymptomatic testing for SARS-CoV-2 before travel can be an effective strategy to reduce passenger risk of infection during travel, although abbreviated quarantine with post-travel testing is probably needed to reduce population-level transmission due to importation of infection when travelling from a high to low incidence setting.

METHODS: A scan was performed of provincial and territorial reporting of five data elements (cumulative totals of tests, cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and population size) across three units of aggregation (province or territory level, health regions, and local areas) (15 ""overall"" indicators), and for four vulnerable settings (long-term care and detention facilities, schools, and homeless shelters) and eight social markers (age, sex, immigration status, race/ethnicity, healthcare worker status, occupational sector, income, and education) (180 ""equity-related"" indicators) as of December 31, 2020. Per indicator, one point was awarded if case-delimited data were released, 0.7 points if only summary statistics were reported, and 0 if neither was provided. Results were presented using a scorecard approach. RESULTS: Overall, information was more complete for cases and deaths than for tests, hospitalizations, and population size denominators needed for rate estimation. Information provided on jurisdictions and their regions, overall, tended to be more available (average score of 58%, ""D"") than that for equity-related indicators (average score of 17%, ""F""). Only British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario provided case-delimited data, with Ontario and Alberta providing case information for local areas. No jurisdiction reported on outcomes according to patients' immigration status, race/ethnicity, income, or education. Though several provinces reported on cases in long-term care facilities, only Ontario and Quebec provided detailed information for detention facilities and schools, and only Ontario reported on cases within homeless shelters and across occupational sectors. CONCLUSION: One year into the pandemic, socially stratified reporting for COVID-19 outcomes remains sparse in Canada. However, several ""best practices"" in health equity-oriented reporting were observed and set a relevant precedent for all jurisdictions to follow for this pandemic and future ones.","Blair, Alexandra; Warsame, Kahiye; Naik, Harsh; Byrne, Walter; Parnia, Abtin; Siddiqi, Arjumand",Can J Public Health,436,24

The built environment that facilitates crowding increases exposure and hence transmission of COVID-19 as evidenced by outbreaks in both cool-dry and hot-humid climates, such as in the US prison system and dormitories in Singapore, respectively. This paper explores how the built environment influences crowding and COVID-19 transmission, focusing on informal urban settlements (slums). We propose policy and practice changes that could reduce COVID-19 transmission. There are several issues on how COVID-19 affects informal urban settlements. Slum populations tend to be younger than the overall population. Lower numbers of older people lessen the morbidity and mortality of the pandemic in slum areas. Second, many slum populations are highly mobile. By returning to their ancestral villages residents can avoid the risks of overcrowding and reduce the population density in a given area but may spread COVID-19 to other areas. Third, detection and registration of COVID-19 cases depends on patients presenting to health care providers. If the risk of visiting a health care centre outweighs the potential benefits patients may prefer not to seek treatment. The control and prevention of COVID-19 in informal urban settlements starts with organizing community infrastructure for diagnosis and treatment and assuring that basic needs (food, water, sanitation, health care and public transport) are met during quarantine. Next, community members at highest risk need to be identified and protected. Low-income, informal settlements need to be recognized as a reservoir and source for persistent transmission. Solutions to overcrowding must be developed for this and future pandemics. In view of the constant risk that slums present to the entire population decisive steps need to be taken to rehabilitate and improve informal settlements, while avoiding stigmatization.","von Seidlein, Lorenz; Alabaster, Graham; Deen, Jacqueline; Knudsen, Jakob",Build Environ,436,1

The purpose of this study was to assess the implementation of a virtual teaching method using available technology and its role in the continuity of education of practicing radiologists and trainees during the pandemic. METHODS: The authors created the Online Liver Imaging Course (OLIC) that comprised 28 online comprehensive lectures delivered in real-time and on-demand over six weeks. Radiologists and radiology trainees were asked to register to attend the live sessions. At the end of the course, we conducted a 46-question survey among registrants addressing their training level, perception of virtual conferencing, and evaluation of the course content. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred and thirty four radiologists and trainees completed interest sign up forms before the start of the course with the first webinar having the highest number of live attendees (343 people). On average, there were 89 live participants per session and 750 YouTube views per recording (as of July 9, 2020). After the end of the course, 487 attendees from 37 countries responded to the postcourse survey for an overall response rate of (33%). Approximately (63%) of participants were practicing radiologists while (37%) were either fellows or residents and rarely medical students. The overwhelming majority (97%) found the OLIC webinar series to be beneficial. Essentially all attendees felt that the webinar sessions met (43%) or exceeded (57%) their expectations. When asked about their perception of virtual conferences after attending OLIC lectures, almost all attendees (99%) enjoyed the virtual conference with a majority (61%) of the respondents who enjoyed the virtual format more than in-person conferences, while (38%) enjoyed the webinar format but preferred in-person conferences. When asked about the willingness to attend virtual webinars in the future, (84%) said that they would attend future virtual conferences even if in-person conferences resume while (15%) were unsure. CONCLUSION: The success of the OLIC, attributed to many factors, indicates that videoconferencing technology provides an inexpensive alternative to in-person radiology conferences. The positive responses to our postcourse survey suggest that virtual education will remain to stay. Educational institutions and scientific societies should foster such models.","Elsayes, Khaled M; Marks, Robert M; Kamel, Serageldin; Towbin, Alexander J; Kielar, Ania Z; Patel, Parth; Chernyak, Victoria; Fowler, Kathryn J; Nassar, Sameh; Soliman, Moataz A; Kamaya, Aya; Mendiratta-Lala, Mishal; Borhani, Amir A; Fetzer, David T; Fung, Alice W; Do, Richard K G; Bashir, Mustafa R; Lee, James; Consul, Nikita; Olmsted, Richard; Kambadone, Avinash; Taouli, Bachir; Furlan, Alessandro; Sirlin, Claude B; Hsieh, Peggy",Acad Radiol,436,1

While they are structurally similar to hydrocarbon acenes (e.g., pentacene) the presence of increasing numbers of N-heteroatoms introduces several different additional features of the compounds so that they can be considered for investigations beyond those suggested for acenes (i.e., organic field-effect transistors, solar cell components). Pyrazinacenes are in several ways complementary to C-H-only acenes based on the increasing stability of reduced states of the compounds with increasing numbers of fused pyrazine rings, although an acene-like electronic structure persists in the compounds so far studied. However, the introduction of multiple N atoms leads to properties that depart from C-H-only acenes. In particular, the compounds exhibit a delocalization of NH protons in extended reduced compounds and oxidation state switchability in solution and at interfaces. The presence of NH groups also allows an easy introduction of solubilizing groups at the pyrazinacene chromophore. In this Account, we will describe the preparation of extended pyrazinacenes from dipyrazino[2,3-b:2',3'-e]pyrazine (1,4,5,8,9,10-hexaazaanthracene; N6) derivatives up to 1,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,13,14,15,16,17,18-tetradecaazaheptacene (N14) and also assess structures of the relevant compounds based on X-ray crystallographic studies. Emergent properties of the molecules include highly unusual linear tautomeric processes based on a delocalization of protons (and the corresponding formation of orbitals based on multiple adjacent N lone electron pair interactions), which suggest special transport properties based on molecular protonics. Molecules such as decazapentacene (N10) exhibit multistability of oxidation state, and this is predicted to promote the redox catalytic properties of the compounds. The oxidation-state switching of on-surface processes is also described and has been investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy. The longest known pyrazinacene chromophore (N14) exhibits amphiprotism with its state of protonation being strongly coupled to its fluorescence emission properties in the near-infrared region indicating possible uses in pH-coupled bioimaging applications. The synthesis of the pyrazinacenes is flexible and allows the preparation of symmetrically or unsymmetrically substituted derivatives for the development of more complex molecules and for control of the electronic structure of the acene unit. Overall, the pyrazinacenes represent an emerging class of highly nitrogenous heteroacenes with unique properties and excellent potential for development in different applications based on their special supramolecular properties including guest binding or interactions in biological systems.","Richards, Gary J; Hill, Jonathan P",Acc. chem. res,436,12

Observational studies suggest indolent cardiovascular involvement after recovery from acute COVID-19. However, these findings may reflect pre-existing cardiac phenotypes. AIMS: We tested the association of baseline cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) phenotypes with incident COVID-19. METHODS: We studied UK Biobank participants with CMR imaging and COVID-19 testing. We considered left and right ventricular (LV, RV) volumes, ejection fractions, and stroke volumes, LV mass, LV strain, native T1, aortic distensibility, and arterial stiffness index. COVID-19 test results were obtained from Public Health England. Co-morbidities were ascertained from self-report and hospital episode statistics (HES). Critical care admission and death were from HES and death register records. We investigated the association of each cardiovascular measure with COVID-19 test result in multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and prior myocardial infarction. RESULTS: We studied 310 participants (n = 70 positive). Median age was 63.8 [57.5, 72.1] years; 51.0% (n = 158) were male. 78.7% (n = 244) were tested in hospital, 3.5% (n = 11) required critical care admission, and 6.1% (n = 19) died. In fully adjusted models, smaller LV/RV end-diastolic volumes, smaller LV stroke volume, and poorer global longitudinal strain were associated with significantly higher odds of COVID-19 positivity. DISCUSSION: We demonstrate association of pre-existing adverse CMR phenotypes with greater odds of COVID-19 positivity independent of classical cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Observational reports of cardiovascular involvement after COVID-19 may, at least partly, reflect pre-existing cardiac status rather than COVID-19 induced alterations.","Raisi-Estabragh, Zahra; McCracken, Celeste; Cooper, Jackie; Fung, Kenneth; Paiva, José M; Khanji, Mohammed Y; Rauseo, Elisa; Biasiolli, Luca; Raman, Betty; Piechnik, Stefan K; Neubauer, Stefan; Munroe, Patricia B; Harvey, Nicholas C; Petersen, Steffen E",Aging Clin Exp Res,436,1

Automatically segmenting lesions from chest Computed Tomography (CT) is a promising way to assist doctors in COVID-19 screening, treatment planning, and follow-up monitoring. However, voxel-wise annotations are extremely expert-demanding and scarce, especially when it comes to novel diseases, while an abundance of unlabeled data could be available. To tackle the challenge of limited annotations, in this paper, we propose an uncertainty-guided dual-consistency learning network (UDC-Net) for semi-supervised COVID-19 lesion segmentation from CT images. Specifically, we present a dual-consistency learning scheme that simultaneously imposes image transformation equivalence and feature perturbation invariance to effectively harness the knowledge from unlabeled data. We then quantify the segmentation uncertainty in two forms and employ them together to guide the consistency regularization for more reliable unsupervised learning. Extensive experiments showed that our proposed UDC-Net improves the fully supervised method by 6.3% in Dice and outperforms other competitive semi-supervised approaches by significant margins, demonstrating high potential in real-world clinical practice.","Li, Yanwen; Luo, Luyang; Lin, Huangjing; Chen, Hao; Heng, Pheng-Ann",,436,6

The masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) served as an intermediate host in the bat-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 20031. Because of their unique role in the SARS outbreak, civets were suspected as a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological pathogen of the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides their susceptibility to coronaviruses, civets can also be infected by other viruses, such as canine distemper viruses2, parvoviruses3, influenza viruses4, etc. Regarding the ecological and economical role of civets, it is vital to evaluate the potential threats from different pathogens to these animals. Receptor binding is a necessary step for virus entry into host cells. Understanding the distribution of receptors of various viruses provides hints to their potential tissue tropisms.

Outpatients who had recently been diagnosed with COVID-19 or were presenting with suspected COVID-19 were asked to have a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab collected and provide at least one self-collected sample type. Participants were also asked about sample acceptability using a five-point Likert scale. For those previously diagnosed with COVID-19, all samples underwent real-time PCR testing using a lab-developed assay, and the majority were also tested using an FDA-authorized assay. For those presenting with suspected COVID-19, only those with a positive nasopharyngeal swab sample went on to have other samples tested. Saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples were tested daily at time zero, day 1, and day 2 to assess nucleic acid stability at room temperature. Fifty participants (aged 4 to 71 years) were included; of these, 40 had at least one positive sample and were included in the primary sample yield analysis.

Potentially, the COVID-19 pandemic affects physical and mental health as well as behavioral and social aspects. However, the direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related parameters are not yet known. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of 16 weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related parameters of physically inactive women aged 50 to 70 years. METHODS: Thirty-four physically inactive women participated in the study. We performed tests to evaluate aerobic capacity and muscle strength, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure (BP), blood parameters, diet, and physical activity levels. All evaluations were carried out before and 16 weeks after the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil (i.e., from March to July 2020). RESULTS: Systolic BP (p < .0001; effect size (ES) = 0.62), diastolic BP (p < .0001; ES = 0.71), grip strength of the right (p < .05; ES = 0.43) and left hand (p < .05; ES = 0.49), performance in six-minute walk test (p < .05; ES = 0.46), free time physical activity levels (p < .05; ES = 0.40), domestic physical activity levels (p < .05; ES = 0.39), platelet count (p < .0001; ES = 0.48), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (p < .0001; ES = 1.14) reduced in comparison to the period before the pandemic.

Several factors may influence a person's willingness to report symptoms and their ability to access healthcare services. Understanding these factors has become urgent during the COVID-19 pandemic. To determine which factors influence symptom reporting during an emerging infectious disease outbreak, we conducted a rapid review of the evidence. Studies included in the review were based on primary research, published in a peer-reviewed journal, written in English, included factors associated with symptom reporting or accessing healthcare, and were related to a major public health incident involving an infectious disease outbreak. Five themes were identified as facilitators of symptom reporting or accessing healthcare: accurate and informative communication about the disease and the need to seek help, symptom severity, concern about disease exposure, ease of access to healthcare facilities, and relationship with the healthcare provider. Seven themes were identified as barriers to symptom reporting or accessing healthcare: lack of knowledge of the disease and its treatment, fear of the disease and fear of subsequent treatments or requirements, stigmatization attached to having a disease, invasion of privacy, low concern about symptoms, economic consequences of disease diagnosis, and challenges related to attending a healthcare facility. For contract tracing services to be effective, members of the public need to have the capability, opportunity, and motivation to use them. The themes identified should be used to evaluate information provided to the public to ensure as many people as possible with relevant symptoms report them to a healthcare provider.","Carter, Patrice; Megnin-Viggars, Odette; Rubin, G James",Health Secur,436,16

Solid evidence on the effect on postoperative infection rates is missing. Due to a national scarcity in surgical masks during the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis the usage of these masks was decreased. In our tertiary referral centre for Surgical Oncology, this led to the decision that, for a period of ten weeks, the surgical masks were only being used by the sterile surgical team and not by non-sterile operation theatre personnel. This retrospective study evaluates the influence of this intervention in terms of postoperative wound infection rates. Design Retrospective cohort study. Method Consecutive patients undergoing surgery during the first COVID-19 wave (2-3-2020 until 11-05-2020) were compared with patients undergoing surgery in the same period a year earlier. Patients undergoing surgery for soft-tissue malignancies were included. Intra-abdominal surgery was excluded. Primary outcome measurement was wound infection rate within 30 days following surgery. Secondary, a cost reduction analysis was made. Results In the COVID-19 wave, a total of 219 patients underwent surgery for soft-tissue malignancies, compared to 241 a year earlier. The incidence of postoperative wound infection was 58/460 (12.6%) for the total cohort. There was no difference in infection rate between the COVID-19 period and the same period in 2019;25/219 (11,4%;95% CI: 7,8-16,4) vs. 33/241 (13,7%;95% CI: 9,8-18,6), p = 0,46 respectively. During the COVID-19 wave, a total of 6.400 of surgical masks were used by the personnel in the operation theatre complex, compared to a total of 11.000 in the same period in 2019. This resulted in a reduction of 42% in usage of surgical masks. Conclusion Based on this mono-centric, explorative retrospective cohort study, it seems that omitting the surgical mask for the non-sterile operation theatre personnel does not influence the postoperative wound infection rate. Despite the fact that our sample size is small, the impressive reduction in usage of 42% demands further research initiatives on a larger scale.","Borstlap, W. A. A.; Hilst, J. van Kuhlmann K. F.

These events pose serious threats to public health due to time lags in developing vaccines to activate the acquired immune system. The high variability of people’s symptomatic responses to viral infections, as illustrated in the current COVID-19 pandemic, indicates the potential to moderate the severity of morbidity from VRIs. Growing evidence supports roles for probiotic bacteria (PB) and prebiotic dietary fiber (DF) and other plant nutritional bioactives in modulating immune functions. While human studies help to understand the epidemiology and immunopathology of VRIs, the chaotic nature of viral transmissions makes it difficult to undertake mechanistic study where the pre-conditioning of the metabolic and immune system could be beneficial. However, recent experimental studies have significantly enhanced our understanding of how PB and DF, along with plant bioactives, can significantly modulate innate and acquired immunity responses to VRIs. Synbiotic combinations of PB and DF potentiate increased benefits primarily through augmenting the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate. These and specific plant polyphenolics help to regulate immune responses to both restrain VRIs and temper the neutrophil response that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This review highlights the current understanding of the potential impact of targeted nutritional strategies in setting a balanced immune tone for viral clearance and reinforcing homeostasis. This knowledge may guide the development of public health tactics and the application of functional foods with PB and DF components as a nutritional approach to support countering VRI morbidity.","Shinde, Tanvi; Hansbro, Philip M.; Sohal, Sukhwinder Singh; Dingle, Peter; Eri, Rajaraman; Stanley, Roger",Microorg.,436,16

First objective of our study was to study the FPs' knowledge about COVID-19 and second objective was to assess their attitudes, stress and death anxiety surrounding the current pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was prepared to collect responses from FPs between March-April 2020. A descriptive and correlational design was utilized. RESULTS: 240 FPs from eight countries were evaluated. The majority reported that they receive most information from medical journals (77%). The majority of respondents also noted that the most common symptoms are acute respiratory syndrome and fever - with the most effective treatment in most cases consisting of symptomatic treatment (41%). Although FPs generally had a positive attitude, most of them (68%) were concerned about contracting COVID-19 from patients and as a result, they experienced increased stress (64%). CONCLUSION: The research was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak while the FPs were working on the frontline of the pandemic. This research revealed that most of the FPs have good knowledge of, and a positive attitude towards COVID-19 treatment. It was observed that participants who tended towards conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience, and who had higher life satisfaction, and lower levels of death anxiety also reported more positive attitudes towards COVID-19. While the main target population of COVID-19 disease are the older age groups, FPs' attitudes and fear levels were not associated with age, gender, or years of experience.","Gokdemir, Ozden; Pak, Halil; Bakola, Maria; Bhattacharya, Sudip; Hoedebecke, Kyle; Jelastopulu, Eleni",,436,1

It consists in applying an electric field (EF) with a frequency of 200 kHz using two pairs of transducer arrays placed on the head. Current should be injected at least 18 h/day and induce a minimum EF intensity of 1 V/cm at the tumor bed for the treatment to be effective. To avoid scalp burns, Optune, the device used to apply this technique in patients, monitors the temperature of the transducers and keeps them below 41 °C by reducing the injected current. The goal of this study was to quantify the impact of the uncertainty associated with the electric and thermal parameters on the predicted temperature of the transducers and of each tissue when TTFields were applied. METHODS: We used a realistic head model, added the two pairs of transducers arrays on the scalp and a virtual lesion, mimicking a glioblastoma tumor in the right hemisphere. Minimum, standard and maximum values for the electric and thermal properties of each tissue were taken from the literature after an extensive review. We used finite element methods (COMSOL Multiphysics) to solve Laplace's equation for the electric potential and Pennes' equation for the temperature distribution. RESULTS: We observed that the electric conductivity of the scalp and skull, as well as scalp's blood perfusion and thermal conductivity were the parameters to which tissue and transducers temperature were most sensitive to. Considering all simulations, scalp's maximum temperature was around 43.5 °C, skull's 42 °C, CSF's 41.2 °C and brain's 39.3 °C. According to the literature, for this temperature range, some physiological changes are predicted only for the brain. The average temperature of the transducers varied between 38.1 °C and 41.6 °C which suggests that modelling TTFields current injection is very sensitive to the parameters chosen. CONCLUSIONS: Better knowledge of the physical properties of tissues and materials and how they change with the temperature is needed to improve the accuracy of these predictions. This information would likely decrease the predicted temperature maxima in the brain and thus help ascertaining TTFields safety from a thermal point of view.","Gentilal, Nichal; Miranda, Pedro Cavaleiro",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,436,3

We evaluated a novel, user-friendly and cost-effective technique utilizing a Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) tool that is readily available in the electronic medical record (EMR), using skeletal muscle density (SMD) to detect myosteatosis and then compared PACS results with those derived from widely used body composition software (SliceOMatic, QC, Canada). METHODS: Using retrospective data from a sample of women with early BC (Stage I-III) who had CT scan and received chemotherapy. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to compare SliceOMatic with PACS results. Associations of PACS results with chemotherapy-related adverse events were evaluated using multivariable (MV) log-binomial models adjusted for age, race, BMI, anthracycline-based therapy, and number of comorbidities. RESULTS: In 338 patients, mean age was 51, 32% were non-white, and 40% had obesity (BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2). Correlation of SMD using SliceOMatic whole muscle measurements with PACS psoas muscle was 0.76 (p < .0001) and with PACS erector spinae muscle 0.91 (p < .0001). Using PACS psoas muscle, myosteatosis was associated with any adverse event [RR 1.66, CI 1.22-2.26 (p < .0001)], dose reduction [RR 1.63, CI 1.01-2.65 (p = .05)], and early treatment discontinuation [RR 2.14, CI 1.10-4.14 (p = 0.03)]. Using PACS erector spinae muscle, myosteatosis was associated any adverse event [RR 1.59, CI 1.11-2.27 (p = 0.01)] and dose reduction [RR 1.91, CI 1.07-3.42 (p = .03)]. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Skeletal muscle density measures using PACS correlated strongly with SliceOMatic results and both are similarly predictive of chemotherapy-related adverse events.","Aleixo, G F P; Yu, H; Chen, Y T; Nyrop, K A; Louie, R J; Deal, A M; Shachar, S S; Muss, H B; Williams, G R",Breast cancer res. treat,436,24

Detailed reports of infected women breastfeeding their infants are uncommon. Due to incomplete information available, full data about those infants' outcomes are lacking, and evidence of infectivity through breastfeeding has not been documented. MAIN ISSUE: Here, we report about a mother who breastfed her infant until she was confirmed with the SARS-Cov-2 infection. After follow-up, we have confirmed that the infant, who was breastfed by the infected mother, was not infected. METHODS: A 33-year-old woman gave birth to a full-term male infant on November 8, 2019. Since birth, she had been exclusively breastfeeding the baby until she was confirmed with the SARS-Cov-2 infection on February 8, 2020. She was hospitalized, isolated from her baby, and stopped breastfeeding. Even though she remained asymptomatic, her milk was expressed using a breast pump and discarded. The mother's milk sample was collected on February 9, 2020, and the result of the nucleic acid test for COVID-19 was negative. Her infant was asymptomatic and remained virus negative. Her laboratory findings and chest Computed Tomography imaging was normal. She was treated according to the national protocol with aerosolized interferon &#945;2ß, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin. Her serum SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies(IgG and IgM) tested positive when discharged. She returned to breastfeeding after discharge. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that breastfeeding may be less of a risk than anticipated. Additional research is needed to explore this possibility.","Liu, Wei; Liu, Yujie; Liu, Zhenjun; Hong, Changxin; Liu, Jian; Luo, Sihui; Zheng, Xueying",J Hum Lact,436,16

Our aim was to find out the concerns of HCPs working in non-COVID areas. Subjects and Methods: After obtaining institutional ethics approval, a descriptive cross-sectional study was planned. An online Google-based questionnaire was rolled out to all doctors through various social media platforms who were dealing with COVID-negative patients. Results: We received a total of 110 responses. 84.5% of participants were concerned about the risk of infection to self and family, 67.3% were concerned by the disruption of their daily activities. 56.4% of HCPs were disturbed by the lack of any concrete protocol for patient management. Less staff availability, delay in discharging duties toward their patients, and increased workload were other concerns. More than half of the doctors received N-95 masks whenever required and were trained in donning and doffing of Personal protective equipment. Sixty-eight percemt of our respondents labeled their current quality of life as stressful. Conclusion: It is the need of the hour to develop a comprehensive strategy focussing on the above challenges that HCPs working in non-COVID areas are facing.

More than 10 years ago, the proportional recovery rule was introduced by promising that high-fidelity predictions of recovery following stroke were based only on the initially lost motor function, at least for a specific fraction of patients. However, emerging evidence suggests that this recovery rule is subject to various confounds and may apply less universally than previously assumed. Here, we systematically revisited stroke outcome predictions by applying strategies to avoid confounds and fitting hierarchical Bayesian models. We jointly analysed 385 post-stroke trajectories from six separate studies-one of the largest overall datasets of upper limb motor recovery. We addressed confounding ceiling effects by introducing a subset approach and ensured correct model estimation through synthetic data simulations. Subsequently, we used model comparisons to assess the underlying nature of recovery within our empirical recovery data. The first model comparison, relying on the conventional fraction of patients called 'fitters', pointed to a combination of proportional to lost function and constant recovery. 'Proportional to lost' here describes the original notion of proportionality, indicating greater recovery in case of a more severe initial impairment. This combination explained only 32% of the variance in recovery, which is in stark contrast to previous reports of >80%. When instead analysing the complete spectrum of subjects, 'fitters' and 'non-fitters', a combination of proportional to spared function and constant recovery was favoured, implying a more significant improvement in case of more preserved function. Explained variance was at 53%. Therefore, our quantitative findings suggest that motor recovery post-stroke may exhibit some characteristics of proportionality. However, the variance explained was substantially reduced compared to what has previously been reported. This finding motivates future research moving beyond solely behaviour scores to explain stroke recovery and establish robust and discriminating single-subject predictions.","Bonkhoff, Anna K; Hope, Thomas; Bzdok, Danilo; Guggisberg, Adrian G; Hawe, Rachel L; Dukelow, Sean P; Rehme, Anne K; Fink, Gereon R; Grefkes, Christian; Bowman, Howard",Brain,436,20

Because of its mutational rate, wide geographical distribution, and host response variance this coronavirus is currently evolving into an array of strains with increasing genetic diversity. Most variants apparently have neutral effects for disease spread and symptoms severity. However, in the viral Spike protein, which is responsible for host cell attachment and invasion, an emergent variant, containing the amino acid substitution D to G in position 614 (D614G), was suggested to increase viral infection capability. To test whether this variant has epidemiological impact, the temporal distributions of the SARS-CoV-2 samples bearing D or G at position 614 were compared in the USA, Asia and Europe. The epidemiological curves were compared at early and late epidemic stages. At early stages, where containment measures were still not fully implemented, the viral variants are supposed to be unconstrained and its growth curves might approximate the free viral dynamics. Our analysis shows that the D614G prevalence and the growth rates of COVID-19 epidemic curves are correlated in the USA, Asia and Europe. Our results suggest a selective sweep that can be explained, at least in part, by a propagation advantage of this variant, in other words, that the molecular level effects of D614G have sufficient impact on population transmission dynamics as to be detected by differences in rate coefficients of epidemic growth curves.","Furuyama, Taima N.; Antoneli, Fernando; Carvalho, Isabel M.

The width (WSI) and the area of submucosal invasion (ASI) have been suggested as additional parameters to assess the risk of LNM. A review of the literature was undertaken on the correlation between WSI and ASI parameters and the incidence of LNM. METHODS: A Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane Library search was performed to retrieve all studies reporting correlation between WSI/ASI and risk of LNM in T1 colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Eight studies including 1727 patients were identified. All considered the degree of WSI and its influence on LNM: seven assessed different width cut-off of submucosal invasion, and one study the mean width of submucosal invasion in patients having or not involved lymph nodes. The WSI was significantly a prognostic factor for LNM (p < 0.05) in four studies. Both 2 and 3 mm seem to be the most discriminatory cut-off values of submucosal width invasion in defining the risk difference of LNM above and below the cut-off (2 mm, OR = infinite; 3 mm, OR = 6.9). Patients having a cut-off &#8804; 5 mm of WSI showed a low risk (5.6%) of LNM rendering radical surgery unnecessary. Four studies assessed the risk of LNM according to the involved submucosal area (width × depth). In two of these, the ASI was a significant prognostic factor for LNM (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The WSI and ASI seem to be reliable prognostic factors for LNM in T1 colorectal cancer. There is no agreement on ideal cut-off value.","Cracco, Nicola; Todaro, Valentina; Pedrazzi, Giuseppe; Del Rio, Paolo; Haboubi, Najib; Zinicola, Roberto",Int. j. colorectal. dis,436,12

As the respiratory tract connects to the brain without protection of the blood-brain barrier, SARS-CoV-2 might in the early invasive phase attack the cardiorespiratory centres located in the medulla/pons areas, giving rise to disturbances of respiration and cardiac problems. Furthermore, brainstem regions are at risk to lose their functional integrity. Therefore, long-term neurological as well as psychiatric symptomatology and eventual respective disorders cannot be excluded as evidenced from influenza-A triggered post-encephalitic Parkinsonism and HIV-1 triggered AIDS-dementia complex. From the available evidences for coronavirus-induced brain pathology, this review concludes a number of unmet needs for further research strategies like human postmortem brain analyses. SARS-CoV-2 mirroring experimental animal brain studies, characterization of time-dependent and region-dependent spreading behaviours of coronaviruses, enlightening of pathological mechanisms after coronavirus infection using long-term animal models and clinical observations of patients having had COVID-19 infection are calling to develop both protective strategies and drug discoveries to avoid early and late coronavirus-induced functional brain disturbances, symptoms and eventually disorders.

Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 causes an outbreak, the non-pharmaceutical isolation strategies (e.g., social distancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. To this end, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized (C), decentralized (D), and combined (C+D) social distancing strategies, and analyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID-19 on heterogeneous complex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is necessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized strategy is insufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with the centralized one. Indeed, the (C+D) is the most efficient isolation strategy at mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees to less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that stronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the outbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for the (C+D) isolation strategy. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus reactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find that the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the adoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a region) can have alarming effects; thus, our study contributes to an understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic both in space and time. We believe our investigations have a high social relevance as they provide insights into understanding how different degrees of social distancing can reduce the peak infection ratio substantially; this can make the COVID-19 pandemic easier to understand and control over an extended period of time.","Topirceanu, Alexandru; Udrescu, Mihai; Marculescu, Radu",,436,6

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 63 patients with COVID- 19 from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, including 32 moderate cases and 31 severe cases. The demographic data, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations and laboratory test results were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that predicted the severity of COVID-19. The receiver- operating characteristic curve (ROC) of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was determined to estimate the optimal threshold of NLR for predicting severe cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: The patients with moderate and server COVID-19 showed significant differences in the rate of diabetes, NLR, serum amyloid A (SSA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum albumin (ALB) levels (P < 0.05). The co- morbidity of diabetes, NLR, SSA and CRP were found to positively correlate and ALB to inversely correlate with the severity of COVID-19 (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NLR was an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 (OR=1.264, 95% CI: 1.046-1.526, P=0.015) with an AUC of 0.831 (95% CI: 0.730-0.932), an optimal diagnostic threshold of 4.795, a sensitivity of 0.839, and a specificity of 0.750.

We will include approximately 1000 patients in each group from the time period of October 1st , 2014 to April 30th , 2019 and from March 10th , 2020 to March 1st , 2021 for patients with influenza and COVID-19, respectively. The primary outcome is any superinfection within 90 days of admission to the ICU. We will use logistic regression analysis comparing COVID-19 with influenza A/B after adjustment for relevant predefined confounders. Secondarily, we will use unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses to assess six potential risk factors (sex, age, cancer (including haematological), immunosuppression, use of life support on day 1 in the ICU) for superinfections, and compare outcomes in patients with COVID-19 with/without superinfections, and present descriptive data regarding the superinfections.

Of the 2675 patients (55.3%) with f-Hb &#8805;10 µg/g, 252 were diagnosed with CRC (9.4%) with a NNS of 11. Of the 705 patients with f-Hb &#8805;400 µg/g, 158 (22.4%) were diagnosed with CRC with a NNS of 5. Over half of those diagnosed with CRC with f-Hb <10 µg/g had coexisting anaemia. CONCLUSION: Symptomatic patients with f-Hb &#8805;10 µg/g should undergo further investigation for CRC, while higher f-Hb concentrations could be used to triage for urgency during the COVID-19 recovery phase. Patients with f-Hb <10 µg/g and without anaemia are very unlikely to be diagnosed with CRC and the majority need no further investigation.","McSorley, Stephen T; Digby, Jayne; Clyde, Danielle; Cruickshank, Neil; Burton, Paul; Barker, Louise; Strachan, Judith A; Fraser, Callum G; Smith, Karen; Mowat, Craig; Winter, Jack; Steele, Robert J C",Colorectal dis,436,16

Student learning data is collected from 70 online learning modules assigned as both online homework and self-study material in both Fall 2020 and Spring 2020 semesters, with the first 41 modules being assigned before campus closure in Spring 2020. Students' ability to stay on track is measured by three data indicators: percentage of modules submitted before the due date, percentage of modules submitted early for extra credit, and percentage of modules properly engaged with. The student population is divided into two demographic groups according to each of the four demographic variables: Gender, Ethnicity, Transfer Status and First generation status. All three data indicators from both semesters are first compared between each pair of demographic groups within the same semester, and then compared within the same group between the two semesters. Exam and course scores are also compared between demographics groups in Fall 2020 and against scores from the Fall 2019 semester. The analysis revealed that remote learning significantly reduced on-time and early submission for first-generation students, but increased the frequency of early submission for transfer students. Under-represented minority students had higher percentage of engaged modules during the pandemic, while non-URM students had the same level of module engagement before and after the pandemic. These results suggest that pandemic remote learning had very different impact for students with different demographic background, and future instructional design should strive to provide more flexible options to meet the various needs for a diverse higher-ed student population.","Chen, Zhonzhou; Zhang, Tom",,436,15

However, the existing studies on COVID-19 prediction are dominated by constant model parameters, unable to reflect the actual situation of COVID-19 spread. This paper presents a new method for dynamic prediction of COVID-19 spread by considering time-dependent model parameters. This method discretises the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-dead (SEIRD) epidemiological model in time domain to construct the nonlinear state-space equation for dynamic estimation of COVID-19 spread. A maximum likelihood estimation theory is established to online estimate time-dependent model parameters. Subsequently, an extended Kalman filter is developed to estimate dynamic COVID-19 spread based on the online estimated model parameters. The proposed method is applied to simulate and analyse the COVID-19 pandemics in China and the United States based on daily reported cases, demonstrating its efficacy in modelling and prediction of COVID-19 spread.","Song, Jialu; Xie, Hujin; Gao, Bingbing; Zhong, Yongmin; Gu, Chengfan; Choi, Kup-Sze",Chaos Solitons Fractals,436,1

Even though lifestyle modification is one of the most effective ways to prevent and control hypertension, only little emphasis has been given for it compared with treating hypertension with medication. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess adherence to lifestyle modifications and associated factors among hypertensive patients attending Dessie referral hospital. Materials and Methods: Institutional-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among 301 hypertensive patients during May and June, 2020. The study participants were selected with a convenient sampling technique due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected using pre-tested and structured face to face interviewer-administered questionnaire and checked, cleaned and entered into Epi data version 4.4 and exported to SPSS version 25.0 software for analysis. The associations between independent variables and dependent variable were analyzed using binary logistic regression models. Results: A total of 301 respondents participated in the study yielding a response of 100%. The overall adherence in this study was only 23.6%. Independent predictors of adherence to lifestyle modifications were divorced (AOR=0.35; 95% CI (0.13-0.94)) and widowed (AOR=0.27; 95% CI (0.10-0.75)), secondary school education (AOR=4.85; 95% CI (1.54-15.22)), no regular income (AOR=0.22; 95% CI (0.08-0.65)) or monthly income of &#8805;3000 ETB (AOR=5.58; 95% CI (2.46-12.66)), having co-morbidities (AOR=2.37; CI (1.23-4.57)), good knowledge about the disease (AOR=1.83; CI (0.92-3.65)) and good self-efficacy (AOR=3.64; CI (1.75-7.55)). Conclusion and Recommendations: The overall adherence to recommended lifestyle modifications was very low. The independent predictors were marital status, educational level, monthly income, having co-morbidities, knowledge and self-efficacy. Therefore, multifaceted and collaborative implementation of strategies about lifestyle modifications for hypertension prevention and control are needed to address barriers at the patient, provider, system and community levels.","Andualem, Atsedemariam; Gelaye, Habtam; Damtie, Yitayish",Integr Blood Press Control,436,24

The studies provide unprecedented insights on a variety of applications, e.g., literature review and collaboration analysis. However, visual information (e.g., figures) that is widely employed for storytelling and methods description are often neglected. We present VIStory, an interactive storyboard for exploring visual information in scientific publications. We harvest a new dataset of a large corpora of figures, using an automatic figure extraction method. Each figure contains various attributes such as dominant color and width/height ratio, together with faceted metadata of the publication including venues, authors, and keywords. To depict these information, we develop an intuitive interface consisting of three components: (1) Faceted View enables efficient query by publication metadata, benefiting from a nested table structure, (2) Storyboard View arranges paper rings-a well-designed glyph for depicting figure attributes, in a themeriver layout to reveal temporal trends, and (3) Endgame View presents a highlighted figure together with the publication metadata. We illustrate the applicability of VIStory with case studies on two datasets, i.e., 10-year IEEE VIS publications, and publications by a research team at CVPR, ICCV, and ECCV conferences. Quantitative and qualitative results from a formal user study demonstrate the efficiency of VIStory in exploring visual information in scientific publications.","Zeng, Wei; Dong, Ao; Chen, Xi; Cheng, Zhang-Lin",J Vis (Tokyo),436,24

Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and initially of non-severe type were retrospectively included. The initial CT scan on admission was used for imaging analysis. The presence of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and other findings were visually evaluated. CT severity score was calculated according to the extent of lesion involvement. In addition, AI based quantification of GGO and consolidation volume were also performed. 123 patients (mean age: 64.43 ± 14.02; 62 males) were included. GGO + consolidation was more frequently revealed in progress-to-severe group whereas pure GGO was more likely to be found in non-severe group. Compared to non-severe group, patients in progress-to-severe group had larger GGO volume (167.33 ± 167.88 cm3 versus 101.12 ± 127 cm3, p = 0.013) as well as consolidation volume (40.85 ± 60.4 cm3 versus 6.63 ± 14.91 cm3, p < 0.001). Among imaging parameters, consolidation volume had the largest area under curve (AUC) in discriminating non-severe from progress-to-severe group (AUC = 0.796, p < 0.001) and patients with or without critical events (AUC = 0.754, p < 0.001). According to multivariate regression, consolidation volume and age were two strongest predictors for disease progression (hazard ratio: 1.053 and 1.071, p: 0.006 and 0.008) whereas age and diabetes were predictors for unfavorable outcome. Consolidation volume quantified on initial chest CT was the strongest predictor for disease severity progression and larger consolidation volume was associated with unfavorable clinical outcome.","Li, Yuehua; Shang, Kai; Bian, Wei; He, Li; Fan, Ying; Ren, Tao; Zhang, Jiayin",Sci Rep,436,16

They probably play a crucial role in the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We describe a super-spreading event within a team working in an open-space office and investigate factors potentially having facilitated SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, semi-structured telephone interviews with all team members were carried out to identify symptoms, contacts, and adherence to basic hygiene measures. During site visits, we gathered information about workplace and seating arrangements. The secondary attack rate in office and households was calculated. Potential respiratory viral co-infections were assessed by multiplex PCR. SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing was performed using a tiled-amplicon sequencing approach. RESULTS: Of 13 team members, 11 fell ill with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Due to the sequence of events and full genome sequence data, one person was considered the index case for this outbreak, directly infecting 67 to 83% of the teammates. All team members reported repetitive close contacts among themselves during joint computer work, team meetings and a ""Happy Birthday"" serenade. Two individuals shared nuts and dates. The arrangement of the office and meeting rooms precluded sufficient adherence to physical distancing. The index case and a further individual were diagnosed with an adenovirus serotype 4 co-infection. CONCLUSION: We identified several environmental and behavioral factors that probably have facilitated the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The relevance of the adenovirus co-infection remains unclear and merits further investigation.","Weissberg, Dana; Böni, Jürg; Rampini, Silvana K; Kufner, Verena; Zaheri, Maryam; Schreiber, Peter W; Abela, Irene A; Huber, Michael; Sax, Hugo; Wolfensberger, Aline",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,436,26

Here, we studied the hydrogen/deuterium (H/D)-exchange behavior of unfolded human ubiquitin in 6 M guanidinium chloride. We employed a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-quenched H/D-exchange NMR technique with the use of spin desalting columns, which allowed us to perform a quick medium exchange from 6 M guanidinium chloride to a quenching DMSO solution. Based on the backbone resonance assignment of ubiquitin in the DMSO solution, we successfully investigated the H/D-exchange kinetics of 60 identified peptide amide groups in the ubiquitin sequence. Although a majority of these amide groups were not protected, certain amide groups involved in a middle helix (residues 23-34) and an N-terminal ß-hairpin (residues 2-16) were significantly protected with a protection factor of 2.1-4.2, indicating that there were residual structures in unfolded ubiquitin and that these amide groups were more than 52% hydrogen bonded in the residual structures. We show that the hydrogen-bonded residual structures in the &#945;-helix and the ß-hairpin are formed even in 6 M guanidinium chloride, suggesting that these residual structures may function as a folding initiation site to guide the subsequent folding reactions of ubiquitin.","Yagi-Utsumi, Maho; Chandak, Mahesh S; Yanaka, Saeko; Hiranyakorn, Methanee; Nakamura, Takashi; Kato, Koichi; Kuwajima, Kunihiro",Biophys J,436,1

The aim of this study was to investigate ACE2 gene expression in skin using a public database. METHODS: A search of transcriptomic data sets from a public gene expression database to investigate ACE2 gene expression in human tissues. RESULTS: Human skin keratinocytes and basal cells express more ACE2 than lung epithelial cells. In contrast, both fibroblasts and melanocytes from human skin express less ACE2 than human lung epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: The high expression of ACE2 in keratinocytes and basal cells of human skin indicates that they may be directly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection via the ACE2 receptor, especially in conditions of skin barrier dysfunction, and are therefore a potential target for the coronavirus.","Al-Benna, Sammy",Adv Skin Wound Care,436,1

A secondary aim was to investigate differences between those who frequently included their children in cooking activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and those that included their children less, on a number of factors such as working from home, parents' diet quality and cooking skills confidence. DESIGN: Cross-continental survey with Wilcoxon signed ranks, Independent t-tests, Mann Whitney-U, Chi2, and a binomial logistic regression used for assessment. SETTING: Online. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of parents over 18 years from the island of Ireland (N=180), Great Britain (N=312), United States of America (N=120), New Zealand (N=166). RESULTS: In three regions, parents' time spent cooking and inclusion of children in everyday cooking activities increased (p<0.001). Country (OR=3.6, 95% CI=1.7-7.6), education (OR=1.6, 95% CI =1.1-2.4), cooking skills confidence (OR=1.02, 95% CI=1.009-1.032) and a parental higher intake of vegetables (OR=1.3, 95% CI=1.1-1.5) were significant predictors of a more frequent inclusion of children in cooking activities. CONCLUSIONS: While there a number of key benefits to including children in cooking for the children such as providing life skills and increases in diet quality, this study highlighted a higher intake of vegetables by parents who included children more frequently in cooking activities. With continued lockdowns due to COVID-19 and perhaps more flexibility in working from home in the future, including children in cooking activities should be a key public health message for both children and parents.","Benson, Tony; Murphy, Blain; McCloat, Amanda; Mooney, Elaine; Dean, Moira; Lavelle, Fiona",Public Health Nutr,436,29

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a multi-expressed glycoprotein that is speculated to be a functional SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Previous studies remain controversial regarding whether DPP-4 use is associated with reduced risk for COVID-19 diabetic patients. Thus, this meta-analysis is performed. Method: A comprehensive literature search on PubMed was conducted to identify all relevant studies published prior to October 2020. This meta-analysis was reported in conformity to the Preferred Reporting Project declared by the Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). The quality assessment was performed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Random-effect model or fixed-effect model was used based on heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were performed based on types of diabetes, geographic locations, study designs, and different sample sizes. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias detection were also performed. All statistical analyses were performed using RevMan and STATA 12.0 statistical software, and all P values were two-tailed, the test level was 0.05. Result: 69 articles were obtained. 5 articles involving 49,989 participants were included. All included studies were considered moderate to high quality. No decreased mortality of COVID-19 diabetic patients was found among DPP-4 users (OR 0.86, 95%CI: 0.22,3.41, P=0.083, I2=81%). In the subgroup analysis, studies in Asia (OR 3.11, 95%CI: 0.78, 12.34, P=0.001, I2=70%) did not found reduced mortality, whereas studies in Europe (OR 0.36, 95%CI: 0.23, 0.56, P&amp;lt;0.00001, I2=0%) were associated with reduced mortality. Based on study designs, the four case-control studies (OR 1.27, 95%CI: 0.27, 5.93, P=0.76, I2=89%) did not find reduced mortality, but one cohort study (OR 0.13, 95%CI: 0.02, 0.84, P=0.03) showed a reduced mortality. The four studies investigating Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) did found reduced mortality (OR 0.74, 95%CI: 0.13, 4.24, P=0.73, I2=90%). For sample size &amp;gt;200, reduced risk of mortality (OR 0.28, 95%CI: 0.07, 1.15, P=0.08, I2=32%) was found, however, for sample ≤200, no statistically significant association (OR 1.44, 95%CI: 0.23, 8.89, P=0.70, I2=93%) was found. Sensitivity analysis by changing models and omitting each study at a time confirm the stability of the result. Begg’s test (z=-0.24, P=1.000) and Egger’s test (t=0.56, P=0.618) did not detect a significant risk of publication bias. Conclusion: The current meta-analysis did not find reduced mortality for COVID-19 diabetic patients who take DPP-4. However, subgroup-analyses found reduced mortality in Europe. More high-quality original studies are needed to further explore the association between DPP-4 use and the mortality risk of COVID-19.","Sun, Chenyu Kim Keun Young Ahmed Mubashir Ayaz Manem Reveena Bhan Chandur Cheng Ce",Journal of the Endocrine Society,436,26

Patient characteristics, RR practices, and hospital context and/or mechanism influence post-RR outcomes. We aim to describe and compare RR function and outcomes within our institution's multiple sites. METHODS: We conducted a 3-year retrospective study to compare RR use, clinical characteristics, and outcomes between our hospital's central campus (CC) and 2 satellite campuses (SCs). RR training and procedures are uniform across all campuses. RESULTS: Among the 2935 RRs reviewed, 1816 occurred during index admissions at the CC and 405 occurred at SCs. CC, when compared with SCs, had higher age at RR (3.2 years vs 1.4 years), prevalence of complex chronic conditions (62.4% vs 34.4%), surgical complications (20.2% vs 5%), severity of illness, and risk of mortality (P < .001). CC had higher daytime RR activations, longer time from admission to RR, and more activations by nurses (P < .001). Respiratory diagnoses were most prevalent uniformly, but cardiac, neurologic, and hematologic diagnoses were higher at CC (P < .001). Cardiac and/or respiratory arrests during RR and transfers to the ICU were similar. Cardiorespiratory interventions post-RR, hospital length of stay, and mortality were higher and ICU stay was shorter (P < .01) in the CC. Outcomes were mainly affected by patient characteristics and not RR factors on multivariate analysis.

Five one-step RT-qPCR assays, targeting the polymerase (IP2 and IP4), the envelope E and the nucleoprotein (N1 and N2) genome regions, were employed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in 24-h composite wastewater samples concentrated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation.SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a sewage sample collected 41 days ahead of the declaration of the first COVID-19 case. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies in wastewater evidenced the validity of water-based epidemiology to anticipate COVID-19 outbreaks, to evaluate the impact of control measures and even to estimate the burden of shedders, including presymptomatic, asymptomatic, symptomatic and undiagnosed cases. For this latter objective, a model was applied for the estimation of the total number of shedders, evidencing a high proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals. In this way, an infection prevalence of 2.0-6.5% was figured. On the other hand, a proportion of around 0.12% and 0.09% of the total population was determined to be required for positive detection in the two WWTPs.At the end of the lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 RNA apparently disappeared in the WWTPs but could still be detected in grab samples from four urban sewers. Sewer monitoring allowed for location of specific hot spots of COVID-19, enabling the rapid adoption of appropriate mitigation measures.IMPORTANCE Water-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable early warning tool for tracking the circulation of the virus among the population, including not only symptomatic patients, but also asymptomatic, presymptomatic and misdiagnosed carriers, which represent a high proportion of the infected population. In the specific case of Barcelona, wastewater surveillance anticipated several weeks not only the original COVID-19 pandemic wave, but also the onset of the second wave. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in wastewater evidenced the efficacy of the adopted lockdown measures on the circulation of the virus.","Chavarria-Miró, Gemma; Anfruns-Estrada, Eduard; Martínez-Velázquez, Adán; Vázquez-Portero, Mario; Guix, Susana; Paraira, Miquel; Galofré, Belén; Sánchez, Gloria; Pintó, Rosa M; Bosch, Albert",,436,29

There are eminent needs to develop robust analytical methods to ensure quality control, as well as to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of vaccine. Although in vivo animal tests, such as serum-based ELISA, have been commonly used for quality control of vaccines, these methods have poor precision, are labor intensive, and require the availability of expensive, specific antibodies. Thus, there is growing interest to develop robust bioanalytical assays as alternatives for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of complex vaccine antigens. In this study, a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method was developed using optimized unique peptides for simultaneous determination of spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) protein. Method sensitivity, linearity, repeatability, selectivity, and recovery were evaluated. The amount of S and N proteins in 9 batches of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines were quantified, and their compositions relative to total protein content were consistent. We believe this method can be applied for quality evaluation of other S and/or N protein based COVID-19 vaccine, and could be extended to other viral vector, and protein subunit-based vaccines.","Long, Zhen; Wei, Chen; Dong, Xuefang; Li, Xiuling; Yang, Hao; Deng, Haiqing; Ma, Xiao; Yin, Shanshan; Qi, Yingzi; Bo, Tao",J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,436,16

Our study aims to investigate the 30-day mortality rate of hip fracture patients during the first thirty days of the pandemic in the UK. METHODS: A single-center, observational, prospective study of patients presenting with hip fractures. Data collection started from 'day zero' of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and continued for thirty days. We collected data on time-to-surgery, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS), COVID-19 infection status, 30-day mortality and cause of death. For comparison, we collected retrospective data during the same thirty-day period in 2018, 2019 and the previous six months (Control groups A, B and C, respectively). RESULTS: 43 patients were included in the study. There was no difference in age or gender between the Study and Control groups. The 30-day mortality rate of the Study group was 16.3%, which was higher than Control groups A (P=0.022), B (P=0.003) and C (P=0.001). The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in our Study group was 26%. Of the seven mortalities recorded, four patients tested positive for COVID-19 infection. In our Study group, COVID-19 infection correlated significantly with 30-day mortality (P=0.002, odds ratio 2.4). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated a significant increase in 30-day mortality amongst hip fracture patients during the first thirty days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. A positive COVID-19 test result in patients with hip fractures is associated with a 2.4-fold increase in risk of 30-day mortality. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level II.

The FDA Emergency Use Authorization restricts use of CCP to high-titer units only. The purpose of this study was to determine if donor ABO blood group was associated with SARS-CoV-2 antibody response, and subsequent qualification as high-titer CCP. METHODS: All CCP donations collected from April 21, 2020 to September 1, 2020 were included. The Abbott ARCHITECT semi-quantitative chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay was used to assess IgG antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. Units with a S/C value &#8805;4.5 were considered high titer. RESULTS: A total of 232 CCP donations were evaluated. There were no significant differences in the distribution of sex, age, and interval from symptom resolution to donation by ABO blood group. The mean SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody S/C value was significantly lower in blood group O donations (3.6), compared to blood group A (5.0) donations (p < .001). There was no difference in antibody response between the other blood group pairings. Blood group O donations resulted in a lower percentage of high-titer units (35%), compared to blood group A (60%), B (58%), and AB (65%) donations. CONCLUSION: Blood group O donations were found to have significantly lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG nucleocapsid antibodies compared to blood group A donations and were less likely to produce CCP units that qualified as high titer. These findings may aid donor recruitment to promote availability of high-titer CCP to meet patient needs.","Hayes, Chelsea; Rubenstein, Wesley; Gibb, David; Klapper, Ellen; Tanaka, Julie; Pepkowitz, Samuel",Transfusion,436,1

Meanwhile in the community, many other contained patients could only use self-care strategies, especially in countries that have set up a long and strict containment such as France. The study aimed to compare coping strategies deployed by patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS; a poorly recognised syndrome) to those with better known and referenced chronic conditions. An online flash survey was conducted during the containment period in partnership with French Patients Organizations including ME/CFS national association. Therefore, 'Brief COPE' version of Lazarus and Folkman's Ways of Coping Check List has been adapted to the specificity of the containment. The survey was e-distributed in France from 15 April to 11 May 2020. Differences of coping strategies were analyzed using Wilcoxon-Mann-Withney test. Amongst 637 responses, 192 were complete, presenting a wide variety of diseases, including 93 ME/CFS. The latter have significantly different coping strategies than recognised diagnosed diseases patients: similar uses of emotion focused coping but less uses of seek social support and problem-focused copings. In conclusion, coping strategies are different for those who deal with the daily experience of ME/CFS, highly disabling chronic condition with diagnostic ambiguity, low degree of medical and social recognition and without treatment. Better understanding of those strategies is needed to provide the means for health promotion researchers, managers and clinicians, to accompany those patients.","Moncorps, Florence; Jouet, Emmanuelle; Bayen, Sabine; Fornasieri, Isabelle; Renet, Sophie; Las-Vergnas, Olivier; Messaadi, Nassir",Heal. soc. care community,436,26

Patients with leukaemia can be identified using machine learning on the basis of their blood transcriptomes3. However, there is an increasing divide between what is technically possible and what is allowed, because of privacy legislation4,5. Here, to facilitate the integration of any medical data from any data owner worldwide without violating privacy laws, we introduce Swarm Learning-a decentralized machine-learning approach that unites edge computing, blockchain-based peer-to-peer networking and coordination while maintaining confidentiality without the need for a central coordinator, thereby going beyond federated learning. To illustrate the feasibility of using Swarm Learning to develop disease classifiers using distributed data, we chose four use cases of heterogeneous diseases (COVID-19, tuberculosis, leukaemia and lung pathologies). With more than 16,400 blood transcriptomes derived from 127 clinical studies with non-uniform distributions of cases and controls and substantial study biases, as well as more than 95,000 chest X-ray images, we show that Swarm Learning classifiers outperform those developed at individual sites. In addition, Swarm Learning completely fulfils local confidentiality regulations by design.

There is currently no vaccine or therapeutics and several interventions, mostly preventive measures have been proposed to reduce the spread of infection but the efficacy of these interventions, and their likely impact on the number of COVID-19 infections is unknown. In this study, we proposed the SEIQHRS model (susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-hospitalized-recovered-susceptible) model that predicts the trajectory of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy for COVID-19 in Ghana. We provided a short-term forecast of the early phase of the epidemic trajectory in Ghana using the generalized growth model. We estimated the effective basic Reproductive number Re in real-time using three different estimation procedures and simulated worse case epidemic scenarios and the impact of integrated individual and government interventions on the epidemic in the long term using compartmental models. The maximum likelihood estimates of Re and the corresponding 95% confidence interval was 2.04 [95% CI: 1.82-2.27; 12th March-7th April 2020]. The Re estimate using the exponential growth method was 2.11 [95% CI: 2.00-2.24] within the same period. The Re estimate using time-dependent (TD) method showed a gradual decline of the basic Reproductive number since March 12, 2020 when the first 2 index cases were recorded but the rate of transmission remains high (TD: Reâ¯=â¯2.52; 95% CI: [1.87-3.49]). The current estimate of Re based on the TD method is 1.74 [95% CI: 1.41-2.10; (13th May 2020)] but with comprehensive integrated government and individual level interventions, the Re could reduce to 0.5 which is an indication of the epidemic dying out in the general population. Our results showed that enhanced government and individual-level interventions and the intensity of media coverage could have a substantial effect on suppressing transmission of new COVID-19 cases and reduced death rates in Ghana until such a time that a potent vaccine or drug is discovered.","Dwomoh, Duah; Iddi, Samuel; Adu, Bright; Aheto, Justice Moses; Sedzro, Kojo Mensah; Fobil, Julius; Bosomprah, Samuel",,436,20

The transmission rates of airborne pathogens from patient to dental health care workers are unknown. With the outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as seasonal influenza, occasional outbreaks of measles and tuberculosis, and the current pandemic of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, it is important to estimate the risks for dental health care workers. Therefore, the transmission probability of these airborne infectious diseases was estimated via mathematical modeling. The transmission probability was modeled for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, measles virus, influenza virus, and coronaviruses per a modified version of the Wells-Riley equation. This equation incorporated the indoor air quality by using carbon dioxide as a proxy and added the respiratory protection rate from medical face masks and N95 respirators. Scenario-specific analyses, uncertainty analyses, and sensitivity analyses were run to produce probability rates. A high transmission probability was characterized by high patient infectiousness, the absence of respiratory protection, and poor indoor air quality. The highest transmission probabilities were estimated for measles virus (100%), coronaviruses (99.4%), influenza virus (89.4%), and M. tuberculosis (84.0%). The low-risk scenario leads to transmission probabilities of 4.5% for measles virus and 0% for the other pathogens. From the sensitivity analysis, it shows that the transmission probability is strongly driven by indoor air quality, followed by patient infectiousness, and the least by respiratory protection from medical face mask use. Airborne infection transmission of pathogens such as measles virus and coronaviruses is likely to occur in the dental practice. The risk magnitude, however, is highly dependent on specific conditions in each dental clinic. Improved indoor air quality by ventilation, which reduces carbon dioxide, is the most important factor that will either strongly increase or decrease the probability of the transmission of a pathogen.","Zemouri, C; Awad, S F; Volgenant, C M C; Crielaard, W; Laheij, A M G A; de Soet, J J",J Dent Res,436,24

We conducted this meta-analysis to investigate this hypothesis. METHODS: Four databases, namely, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, were used to identify studies on DPP-4 and COVID-19. The outcome indicators were the mortality of COVID-19. Funnel plots, Begg's tests and Egger's tests were used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: Four articles were included with a total of 1933 patients with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes. The use of DPP-4 inhibitors was negatively associated with the risk of mortality (odds ratio (OR) = 0.58 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.34-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: DPP-4 inhibitors may improve the mortality of patients with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes.

Hyperfiltrators were defined as having an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &#8805; 110 mL/min/1.73 m2, and normal filtrators were defined as those having an eGFR between 90 and 110 mL/min/1.73 m2. The seven disease groups for which the data were analyzed were as follows: those (i) without any diseases; (ii) with hypertension only; (iii) with albuminuria only; (iv) with anemia only; (v) with diabetes only; (vi) with hypertension and one or more of diabetes, anemia, and albuminuria; and (vii) with two or more of diabetes, anemia, and albuminuria without hypertension. For almost every PFAA, for all seven disease groups except the albuminuria only group, hyperfiltrators had lower adjusted geometric means (AGM) than normal filtrators. For example, for the disease group with hypertension only, for PFOS, the AGMs for hyperfiltrators and normal filtrators were 8.3 and 10.6 ng/mL, respectively, for the total population. For the group with albuminuria only, normal filtrators were found to have higher AGMs than hyperfiltrators for the total population and males. For example, for PFHxS, the AGMs for normal and hyperfiltrators were 0.98 and 1.05 ng/mL, respectively, for the total population. For females, these AGMs for normal and hyperfiltrators were 0.96 and 0.86 ng/mL respectively. Males usually had higher AGMs than females, but the reverse was also true occasionally. Usually, male-female differences were substantially narrower for normal filtrators than hyperfiltrators. Irrespective of the filtration status, the disease group with hypertension only had the highest AGMs for every PFAA. AGMs for the anemia only group were the lowest for every PFAA as compared with other disease groups among hyperfiltrators.","Jain, Ram B",,436,17

Only a small number of coronaviruses are known to infect humans, and only two are associated with the severe outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, a closely related species of SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, which emerged in 2012. Both of these previous epidemics were controlled fairly rapidly through public health measures, and no vaccines or robust therapeutic interventions were identified. However, previous insights into the immune response to coronaviruses gained during the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have proved beneficial to identifying approaches to the treatment and prophylaxis of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A number of potential therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and the resultant COVID-19 illness were rapidly identified, leading to a large number of clinical trials investigating a variety of possible therapeutic approaches being initiated early on in the pandemic. As a result, a small number of therapeutics have already been authorized by regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, and many other therapeutics remain under investigation. Here, we describe a range of approaches for the treatment of COVID-19, along with their proposed mechanisms of action and the current status of clinical investigation into each candidate.

After confirming the first case, the Ethiopian government has been working a lot to prevent transmission. Most of the reported cases were identified from traveling abroad. Effective prevention and control practices depend on awareness and compliance among the population at all levels. The main objective of this study is to determine the knowledge level and its association with sources of information towards COVID-19 and its prevention techniques in the Gedeo Zone of Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: There are 10 knowledge questions regarding COVID-19 and its prevention techniques. The maximum knowledge score for each question was 1 and the minimum 0, where 0 was scored for incorrect and 1 for correct answers. The overall knowledge score ranges from 0 to 10, where a score of 0-5 as poor knowledge and a score from 6-10 as good knowledge. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression was used to determine the association between dependent and independent variables. The adjusted odds ratio with their 95% CI was used to show the strength of association. p Value < .05 was used to declare a statistically significant association. RESULTS: Among 1170 study participants, 58.1% of the study participants were male. Protestant constitutes 50.6% of the study participants in religion. Regarding knowledge level, 60.5% have good knowledge about COVID-19 and its prevention techniques. Concerning sources of information about COVID-19 and its prevention; internet, family/peer, religious and health workers contributes less <20% whereas telecommunication and television/Radio contributes the largest 56.1% and 85.8% as a source of information respectively. Internet as a source of information AOR: 1.99 (CI: 1.05-3.78, p = .034), information from health worker AOR: 2.324 (CI: 1.228-4.397, p = .010) and information from television or radio AOR: 2.737 (CI: 1.471-5.092, p = .001) has been significantly associated with good knowledge with p value < .05. CONCLUSION: Sources of information had a significant association on the level of knowledge. Residents who had internet, television/radio, and health workers as their information sources had better knowledge regarding COVID-19 and its prevention. Based on this, we recommend increasing internet access, television and radio service, and public health education by trained health workers for effective approaches to fight COVID-19.","Aweke, Zemedu; Jemal, Bedru; Mola, Simeneh; Hussen, Robel",Curr Med Res Opin,436,16

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We queried the FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for all reported symptoms following the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines as of February 12th, 2021. All urologic symptoms were isolated and the reported adverse events associated with each symptom were reviewed. RESULTS: Out of 15,785 adverse event reports, only 0.7% (113) described urologic symptoms. A total of 156 urologic symptoms were described amongst the 113 adverse event reports. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was responsible for 61% of these reports and the Moderna vaccine was responsible for 39%. These symptoms were grouped into five different categories: Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (n = 34, 22%), Hematuria (n = 22, 14%), Urinary Infection (n = 41, 26%), Skin and/or Soft Tissue (n = 16, 10%), and Other (n = 43, 28%). The median age of the patients reporting urologic symptoms was 63 years (IQR 44-79, Range: 19-96) and 54% of the patients were female. CONCLUSION: Urologic symptoms reported after COVID-19 vaccination are extremely rare. Given the common prevalence of many of these reported symptoms in the general population, there does not appear to be a correlation between vaccination and urologic symptoms, but as the vaccination criteria expands, further monitoring of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is needed.","Zhao, Hanson; Souders, Colby; Carmel, Maude; Anger, Jennifer T",Urology,436,23

However, transfection into fish sperm cells still needs to be improved. The objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of tip type electroporation in zebrafish sperm, showing a protocol that provide high transfection efficiency, with minimal side-effects. Sperm was transfected with a Cy3-labelled DNA using tip type electroporation with voltages ranging from 500 to 1500 V. Sperm kinetics parameters were assessed using Computer Assisted Semen Analysis (CASA) and cell integrity, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial functionality and transfection rate were evaluated by flow cytometry. The transfection rates were positively affected by tip type electroporation, reaching 64.9% ± 3.6 in the lowest voltage used (500 V) and 86.6% ± 1.9 in the highest (1500 V). The percentage of overall motile sperm in the electrotransfected samples was found to decrease with increasing field strength (P < 0.05). Increase in the sperm damaged plasma membrane was observed with increasing field strength (P < 0.05). ROS and sperm mitochondrial functionality did not present a negative response after the electroporation (P > 0.05). Overall results indicate that tip type electroporation enhances the internalization of exogenous DNA into zebrafish sperm cells with minimal harmful effects to sperm cells.","Daneluz, Larissa O; Acosta, Izani B; Nunes, Leandro S; Blodorn, Eduardo B; Domingues, William B; Martins, Amanda W S; Dellagostin, Eduardo N; Rassier, Gabriela T; Corcini, Carine D; Fróes, Charles N; Komninou, Eliza R; Varela, Antônio S; Campos, Vinicius F",Mol Biol Rep,436,16

METHODS: Children (aged <18 years) who diagnosed with MIS-C and severe/critical pediatric cases with COVID-19 and were admitted to hospital between March 26 and November 3, 2020 were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients, 22 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with severe/critical disease course and 30 patients diagnosed with MIS-C, were included in the study. Although severe COVID-19 cases and cases with MIS-C share many clinical and laboratory features, MIS-C cases had longer fever duration and higher rate of the existence of rash, conjunctival injection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, altered mental status, and myalgia than in severe cases (p<0.001 for each). Of all, 53.3% of MIS-C cases had the evidence of myocardial involvement as compared to severe cases (27.2%). Additionally, C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) are the independent predictors for the diagnosis of MIS-C, particularly in the existence of conjunctival injection and rash. Corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and biologic immunomodulatory treatments were mainly used in MIS-C cases rather than cases with severe disease course. There were only three deaths among 52 patients, one of whom had Burkitt lymphoma and the two cases with severe COVID-19 of late referral. CONCLUSION: Differences between clinical presentations, acute phase responses, organ involvements, and management strategies indicate that MIS-C might be a distinct immunopathogenic disease as compared to pediatric COVID-19. Conjunctival injection and higher CRP and low WBC count are reliable diagnostic parameters for MIS-C cases. Key Points â¢ MIS-C cases had longer fever duration and higher rate of the existence of rash, conjunctival injection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, altered mental status, and myalgia than in severe/critical pediatric cases with COVID-19. â¢ Higher CRP and low total WBC count are the independent predictors for the diagnosis of MIS-C. â¢ MIS-C might be a distinct immunopathogenic disease as compared to pediatric COVID-19.","Ozsurekci, Yasemin; Gürlevik, Sibel; Kesici, Selman; Akca, Ummusen Kaya; Oygar, Pembe Derin; Aykac, Kubra; Karacanoglu, Dilek; Saritas Nakip, Ozlem; Ilbay, Sare; Katlan, Ban; Ertugrul, Ilker; Cengiz, Ali Bülent; Basaran, Ozge; Cura Yayla, Burcu Ceylan; Karakaya, Jale; Bilginer, Yelda; Bayrakci, Benan; Ceyhan, Mehmet; Ozen, Seza",Clin. rheumatol,436,16

The NYC Public Health System (NYC Health +Hospitals, NYC H + H) was key to the city's response because its vulnerable patient population was disproportionately affected by the disease. As cases rose in the city, NYC H+H carried out plans to greatly expand critical care capacity. Primary ICU spaces were identified and upgraded as needed, while new ICU spaces were created in emergency departments (EDs), procedural areas, and other inpatient units. Patients were transferred between hospitals in order to reduce strain. Critical care staffing was supplemented by temporary recruits, volunteers, and military deployments. Supplies to deliver critical care were monitored closely and obtained as needed to prevent interruptions. An ED action team was formed to ensure that the experience of frontline providers was informing network level decisions. The steps taken by NYC H+H greatly expanded its capacity to provide critical care during an unprecedented surge of COVID-19 cases in NYC. These steps, along with lessons learned, could inform preparations for other health systems during a primary or secondary surge of cases.

Its contagious capacity has forced the governments of the world to decree isolation and quarantine to try to control the pandemic. The consequences that it leaves in all sectors of society have been disastrous. However, technological advances have allowed people to continue their different activities to some extent while maintaining isolation. Universities have great penetration in the use of technology, but they have also been severely affected. To give continuity to education, universities have been forced to move to an educational model based on synchronous encounters, but they have maintained the methodology of a face-to-face educational model, what has caused several problems in the learning of students. This work proposes the transition to a hybrid educational model, provided that this transition is supported by data analysis to identify the new needs of students. The knowledge obtained is contrasted with the performance presented by the students in the face-to-face modality and the necessary parameters for the transition to this modality are clearly established.

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) in people not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa. Participants 18 to less than 65 years of age were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of vaccine containing 5×1010 viral particles or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride solution) 21 to 35 days apart. Serum samples obtained from 25 participants after the second dose were tested by pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays against the original D614G virus and the B.1.351 variant. The primary end points were safety and efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic coronavirus 2019 illness (Covid-19) more than 14 days after the second dose. RESULTS: Between June 24 and November 9, 2020, we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults (median age, 30 years); 1010 and 1011 participants received at least one dose of placebo or vaccine, respectively. Both the pseudovirus and the live-virus neutralization assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351 variant in serum samples obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from placebo recipients. In the primary end-point analysis, mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 23 of 717 placebo recipients (3.2%) and in 19 of 750 vaccine recipients (2.5%), for an efficacy of 21.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], -49.9 to 59.8). Among the 42 participants with Covid-19, 39 cases (95.1% of 41 with sequencing data) were caused by the B.1.351 variant; vaccine efficacy against this variant, analyzed as a secondary end point, was 10.4% (95% CI, -76.8 to 54.8). The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the vaccine and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: A two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant.

These pre-interaction expectations, which include how much they will like the other and how much they will enjoy the interaction, have likely increased because of information easily obtained about others through social media. What is not well understood is whether these expectations prior to a first meeting are associated with interpersonal evaluations formed during the get-acquainted interaction. In this study, pre-interaction expectations were collected from both members of 71 dyads. Then, after the dyads interacted through a structured self-disclosure task conducted over Skype, their reactions were assessed again. Several findings of the study have implications for people meeting for the first time, including over visual forms of computer-mediated communication (CMC). Findings included that pre-interaction expectations were associated with reactions after the interaction, a visual greeting with another before learning information about the other did not moderate the effect of that information on liking and other affiliative outcomes, and participants underestimated how much they were liked after the interaction. The implications of the findings are important because people are increasingly becoming acquainted through visual forms of CMC, which has been amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on mental health is expected to be immense and likely to be long-lasting, raising a range of global problems that need to be addressed accordingly. AIM: To analyze the Scopus-based depression research and COVID-19, explain the advancement of research nowadays, and comment on the possible hotspots of depression research and COVID-19 to obtain a more global perspective. METHODS: In this report, bibliometric analysis and visualization are used to explain COVID-19's global research status on depression and provide researchers with a guide to identify future research directions. Relevant studies on depression and COVID-19 were retrieved from the Scopus database. Visualization maps were produced using the VOSviewer software, including research collaboration. RESULTS: At the time of data collection (November 18, 2020), 77217 documents were released by Scopus to COVID-19 in all areas of research. By limiting the search to depression and COVID-19 (January 2020 up until November 18, 2020), there are 1274 published articles on depression and COVID-19 in the Scopus. The great majority of which are original articles (n = 1049, 82.34%), followed by 118 review articles (9.26%), 66 letters (5.18%). The United States had the highest number of publications at 282 (22.14%), followed by China (19.07%) at 243 and Italy at 121 (9.5%). The major two clusters are signified by mental health outcomes among the general population and mental health outcomes among health care workers. CONCLUSION: The evidence from this study found that many articles focused on mental health outcomes among the general population and health care workers. With adequate psychological support offered by the government or community agencies, mental health in various communities should be put within the local and global public health agenda. This changing situation involves the scientific community's collaborative efforts to contribute to population monitoring during quarantine and COVID-19 outbreaks and to examine the short- and long-term adverse effects on psychological well-being.","Al-Jabi, S.

BNNs are typically implemented using arbitrary normal-distributed prior distributions on the model parameters. Here, we explore the effects of different prior distributions on classification tasks in BNNs and evaluate the evidence supporting the predictions based on posterior probabilities approximated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and by computing Bayes factors. We show that the choice of priors has a substantial impact on the ability of the model to confidently assign data to the correct class (true positive rates). Prior choice also affects significantly the ability of a BNN to identify out-of-distribution instances as unknown (false positive rates). When comparing our results against neural networks (NN) with Monte Carlo dropout we found that BNNs generally outperform NNs. Finally, in our tests we did not find a single best choice as prior distribution. Instead, each dataset yielded the best results under a different prior, indicating that testing alternative options can improve the performance of BNNs.","Silvestro, Daniele; Andermann, Tobias",,436,2

METHOD: Using appropriate keywords, we identified relevant studies in PubMed, the Cochrane library, and Embase. Key pertinent sources in the literature were also reviewed, and all articles published through July 2019 were considered for inclusion. For each study, we assessed odds ratios, mean difference, and 95% confidence interval to assess and synthesize outcomes. RESULT: Twenty-one randomized controlled trials were eligible for this meta-analysis with a total of 3636 patients. Compared with decompression, decompression and fusion significantly increased length of hospital stay, operative time and estimated blood loss. Compared with fusion, decompression significantly decreased operative time, estimated blood loss and overall visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. Compared with endoscopic decompression, microscopic decompression significantly increased length of hospital stay, and operative time. Compared with traditional surgery, endoscopic discectomy significantly decreased length of hospital stay, operative time, estimated blood loss, and overall VAS scores and increased Japanese Orthopeadic Association score. Compared with TLIF, MIS-TLIF significantly decreased length of hospital stay, and increased operative time and SF-36 physical component summary score. Compared with multi-level decompression and single level fusion, multi-level decompression and multi-level fusion significantly increased operative time, estimated blood loss and SF-36 mental component summary score and decreased Oswestry disability index score. Compared with decompression, decompression with interlaminar stabilization significantly decreased operative time and the score of Zurich claudication questionnaire symptom severity, and increased VAS score. CONCLUSION: Considering the limited number of included studies, we still need larger-sample, high-quality, long-term studies to explore the optimal therapy for lumbar spinal stenosis.","Yang, Li-Hui; Liu, Wei; Li, Jian; Zhu, Wen-Yi; An, Li-Kun; Yuan, Shuo; Ke, Han; Zang, Lei",Medicine (Baltimore),436,12

In order to treat the disease, medical imaging emerges as a useful tool for diagnosis. However, the computed tomography (CT) diagnosis of COVID-19 requires experts' extensive clinical experience. Therefore, it is essential to achieve rapid and accurate segmentation and detection of COVID-19. This paper proposes a simple yet efficient and general-purpose network, called Sequential Region Generation Network (SRGNet), to jointly detect and segment the lesion areas of COVID-19. SRGNet can make full use of the supervised segmentation information and then outputs multi-scale segmentation predictions. Through this, high-quality lesion-areas suggestions can be generated on the predicted segmentation maps, reducing the diagnosis cost. Simultaneously, the detection results conversely refine the segmentation map by a post-processing procedure, which significantly improves the segmentation accuracy. The superiorities of our SRGNet over the state-of-the-art methods are validated through extensive experiments on the built COVID-19 database.","Wu, Jipeng; Zhang, Shengchuan; Li, Xi; Chen, Jie; Xu, Haibo; Zheng, Jiawen; Gao, Yue; Tian, Yonghong; Liang, Yongsheng; Ji, Rongrong",Pattern Recognit,436,16

We developed a microfluidic nanoimmunoassay (NIA) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 1,024 samples per device. The method achieved a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98% based on the analysis of 289 human serum samples. To eliminate the need for venipuncture, we developed low-cost, ultralow-volume whole blood sampling methods based on two commercial devices and repurposed a blood glucose test strip. The glucose test strip permits the collection, shipment, and analysis of 0.6 µL of whole blood easily obtainable from a simple finger prick. The NIA platform achieves high throughput, high sensitivity, and specificity based on the analysis of 289 human serum samples, and negligible reagent consumption. We furthermore demonstrate the possibility to combine NIA with decentralized and simple approaches to blood sample collection.

Its genome contains a highly conserved leader sequence at its 5' end, which is added to all subgenomic mRNAs at their 5' terminus by a discontinuous transcription mechanism and regulates their translation. Targeting the leader sequence by RNA interference can be an effective approach to inhibit the viral replication. In the present study an in-silico prediction of highly effective siRNAs was performed to target the leader sequence using the online software siDirect version 2.0. Low seed-duplex stability, exact complementarity with target, at least three mismatches with any off-target and least number of off-targets, were considered as effective criteria for highly specific siRNA. Further validation of siRNA affinity for the target was accomplished by molecular docking by HNADOCK online server. Our results revealed four potential siRNAs, of which siRNA having guide strand sequence 5'GUUUAGAGAACAGAUCUACAA3' met almost all specificity criteria with no off-targets for guide strand. Molecular docking of all predicted siRNAs (guide strand) with the target leader sequence depicted highest binding score of -327.45 for above-mentioned siRNA. Furthermore, molecular docking of the passenger strand of the best candidate with off-target sequences gave significantly low binding scores. Hence, 5'GUUUAGAGAACAGAUCUACAA3' siRNA possess great potential to silence the leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with least off-target effect. Present study provides great scope for development of gene therapy against the prevailing COVID-19 disease, thus further research in this concern is urgently demanded.","Pandey, Anand Kumar; Verma, Shalja",Adv Cell Gene Ther,436,6

Transition between hosts results in distinct environmental signals that influence patterns of gene expression, consistent with the morphological and functional changes operating in the parasites during their life stages. In addition,comparing differential patterns of gene expression among mammalian and tick parasite stages can provide clues for developing improved methods of control. Hereby, we upgraded the genome assembly of Babesia bovis, a bovine hemoparasite, closing a 139 kbp gap, and used RNA-Seq datasets derived from mammalian blood and tick kinete stages to update the genome annotation. Of the originally annotated genes, 1254 required structural changes , and 326 new genes were identified, leading to a different predicted proteome compared to the original annotation. Next, the RNA-Seq data was used to identify B. bovis genes that were differentially expressed in the vertebrate and arthropod hosts. In blood stages, 28% of the genes were upregulated up to 300 fold, whereas 26% of the genes in kinetes, a tick stage, were upregulated up to >19,000 fold.

The new species share similarities with the two previously emerged entities: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) that have caused outbreaks in 2002 and 2012, respectively. Interestingly, all of these coronaviruses can cause potentially fatal respiratory syndromes, though behave differently in patients with cancer compared to patients without cancer. Accordingly, the present chapter aims to, through a systematic investigation, estimate the prevalence of cancer among COVID-19, SARS, and MERS confirmed cases. Our analysis based on data from 78 studies with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 confirmed cases showed that the prevalence of cancer (4.94%) stands at fourth place after hypertension (20.8%), diabetes (11.39%), and cardiovascular diseases (7.46%). According to the findings of the present study, comorbidities are significantly more common in patients with MERS compared to patients with COVID-19 and SARS, and this was the cancer case as well.

The aim of our study is to analyse the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on in-hospital care of patients with CHD in an Italian tertiary centre. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed data on CHD hospital admissions in our centre since 1 March, 2020, when the adoption of a strict infection containment policy throughout the country resulted in limited access of patients to routine hospital care and resources reallocation to the care of infected patients. Comparison with data from the previous year was performed in order to identify any relevant differences attributable to the outbreak. Despite cancellation of all elective procedures, the overall number of urgent hospital admission remained stable throughout the period of study. Patients admitted during the pandemic had greater disease complexity (p = 0.001) with longer length of in-hospital stay (p = 0.01). No adverse events or positive swabs were reported among CHD patients who were admitted to hospital or medical personnel caring for these patients.

Methods: We analyzed 3,355 SARS-CoV-2 positive test results in the state of Geneva (Switzerland) from February 26 to April 30, 2020. We used a spatiotemporal cluster detection algorithm to monitor SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and defined spatial cluster persistence as the time in days from emergence to disappearance. Using spatial cluster persistence measured outcome and a deprivation index based on neighborhood-level census socioeconomic data, stratified survival functions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Population density adjusted Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression models were then used to examine the association between neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 clusters. Results: SARS-CoV-2 clusters persisted significantly longer in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. In the Cox PH model, the standardized deprivation index was associated with an increased spatial cluster persistence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.43 [95% CI, 1.28-1.59]). The adjusted tercile-specific deprivation index HR was 1.82 [95% CI, 1.56-2.17].

Emerging literature increasingly supports the premise that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 promotes a prothrombotic milieu. However, to date there have been no reports of acute aortic occlusion, itself a rare phenomenon. We report a case of fatal acute aortic occlusion in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019. CASE REPORT: A 59-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of peripheral vascular disease presented to the emergency department for evaluation of shortness of breath, fevers, and dry cough. His symptoms started 5-7 days prior to the emergency department visit, and he received antibiotics in the outpatient setting without any effect. He was found to be febrile, tachypneic, and hypoxemic. He was placed on supplemental oxygen via a non-rebreather mask. Chest X-ray showed multifocal opacifications. Intravenous antibiotics for possible pneumonia were initiated. Hydroxychloroquine was initiated to cover possible coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. During the hospitalization, the patient became progressively hypoxemic, for which he was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure. D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein were all elevated. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was positive. On day 3, the patient was upgraded to the intensive care unit. Soon after he was intubated, he developed a mottled appearance of skin, which extended from his bilateral feet up to the level of the subumbilical plane. Bedside ultrasound revealed an absence of flow from the mid-aorta to both common iliac arteries. The patient was evaluated emergently by vascular surgery. After a discussion with the family, it was decided to proceed with comfort-directed care, and the patient died later that day. DISCUSSION: Viral infections have been identified as a source of prothrombotic states due to direct injury of vascular tissue and inflammatory cascades. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 appears to follow a similar pattern, with numerous institutions identifying elevated levels of thrombotic complications. We believe that healthcare providers should be aware of both venous and arterial thrombotic complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019, including possible fatal outcome.","Minalyan, Artem; Thelmo, Franklin L; Chan, Vincent; Tzarnas, Stephanie; Ahmed, Faizan",J Med Case Rep,436,30

There is currently no approved therapeutic for human use against NiV infection. Griffithsin (GRFT) is high-mannose oligosaccharide binding lectin that has shown in vivo broad-spectrum activity against viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus 1, hepatitis C virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro antiviral activities of GRFT and its synthetic trimeric tandemer (3mG) against NiV and other viruses from 4 virus families. The 3mG had comparatively greater potency than GRFT against NiV due to its enhanced ability to block NiV glycoprotein-induced syncytia formation. Our initial in vivo prophylactic evaluation of an oxidation-resistant GRFT (Q-GRFT) showed significant protection against lethal NiV challenge in Syrian golden hamsters. Our results warrant further development of Q-GRFT and 3mG as potential NiV therapeutics.","Lo, Michael K; Spengler, Jessica R; Krumpe, Lauren R H; Welch, Stephen R; Chattopadhyay, Anasuya; Harmon, Jessica R; Coleman-McCray, JoAnn D; Scholte, Florine E M; Hotard, Anne L; Fuqua, Joshua L; Rose, John K; Nichol, Stuart T; Palmer, Kenneth E; O039,; Keefe, Barry R; Spiropoulou, Christina F",J Infect Dis,436,22

OBJECTIVE: To improve public health communication, it is vital to understand, which sociodemographic and psychological factors drive older people's acceptance of and compliance with public health measures. METHOD: This goal was pursued in this three-wave longitudinal online study with older adults, collected between March and June during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (N = 327; first and second wave during the national lockdown; third wave: after the lifting of most lockdown measures). RESULTS: The results show that overall acceptance of and adherence to the public health measures were high among older adults and even more so for people with pre-existing conditions (e.g., cancer, type II diabetes). However, some infringements of the measures were observed, and the longitudinal analyses suggest that increases in social trust positively influenced acceptance of measures over time, while trivialising beliefs and health fears impacted older adults' compliance with protective measures over time. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers insights into the behavioural responses of older adults to an ongoing threat and the associated uncertainty that is part of public communication about the pandemic and protective measures.","Bearth, Angela; Luchsinger, Larissa; Siegrist, Michael",Soc Sci Med,436,13

METHODS: We designed a non-concurrent case-control study of mothers who gave birth during a COVID-19 quarantine period between March 8 and May 3, 2020 (COVID-19 study group), with an antecedent group of matched postpartum women (control group) who delivered in the same period in 2019. Participants completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) on the second day postpartum. RESULTS: The COVID-19 study group (n=91) had significantly higher mean EPDS scores compared with the control group (n=101) (8.5 ± 4.6 vs 6.34 ± 4.1; P<0.001). Furthermore, 28.6% of women in the COVID-19 group had a global EPDS score above 12.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified hospitalized adults with a diagnosis of coronavirus in a large US administrative database, the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample, from January 1, 2016, to December 3, 2017, to study patient demographic characteristics, clinical comorbidities, and outcomes (in-hospital mortality and health care resource utilization) based on the presence or absence of CVD. RESULTS: A total of 21,300 hospitalized adults with a diagnosis of coronavirus in 2016 and 2017 from all across the United States were included in the final analysis; the mean age was 63.6 years, 11,033 (51.8%) were female, and 15,911 (74.7%) had public insurers. Among these hospitalized patients, 11,930 (56.0%) had a diagnosis of CVD. Compared with those without CVD, the patients with CVD were older (70.1 vs 55.4 years) and had higher Charlson comorbidity index scores (2.5 vs 1.6) and Elixhauser comorbidity index scores (4.3 vs 2.4) (all P<.001). After multivariable risk adjustment, patients with CVD had higher mortality than those without CVD (5.3% [632 of 11,930] vs 1.5% [140 of 9370]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.2 to 3.4]; P=.008).

Empirical models are useful tools to predict future trends of disease progression such as COVID-19 over the near-term. A modified Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (m-IDEA) model was developed to predict the progression of infectious disease outbreaks. The modification allows for the production of precise daily estimates, which are critical during a pandemic of this scale for planning purposes. The m-IDEA model was employed using a range of serial intervals given the lack of knowledge on the true serial interval of COVID-19. Both deterministic and stochastic approaches were applied. Model fitting was accomplished through minimizing the sum-of-square differences between predicted and observed daily incidence case counts, and performance was retrospectively assessed. The performance of the m-IDEA for projection cases in the near-term was improved using shorter serial intervals (1–4 days) at early stages of the pandemic, and longer serial intervals at mid- to late-stages (5–9 days) thus far. This, coupled with epidemiological reports, suggests that the serial interval of COVID-19 might increase as the pandemic progresses, which is rather intuitive: Increasing serial intervals can be attributed to gradual increases in public health interventions such as facility closures, public caution and social distancing, thus increasing the time between transmission events. In most cases, the stochastic approach captured the majority of future reported incidence data, because it accounts for the uncertainty around the serial interval of COVID-19. As such, it is the preferred approach for using the m-IDEA during dynamic situation such as in the midst of a major pandemic.","Smith, Ben A.",Infect. Dis. Modelling,436,1

AIMS: To assess the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on the sleep quality of healthcare workers in a children's healthcare centre in Wuhan. METHODS: A cross-sectional, anonymized, self-reported questionnaire survey was conducted at the Children's Healthcare Centre of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. The questionnaire consisted of three parts, including socio-demographic characteristics and COVID-19 epidemic-related factors, the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS). RESULTS: In total, 47 out of 123 (38%) participants with PSQI scores > 7 were identified as having sleep disturbance. A logistic regression analysis showed that sleep disturbance was independently associated with being an only child (adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.40 (1.21-9.57), P < 0.05), exposure to COVID-19 patients (adjusted OR and 95% CI 2.97 (1.08-8.18), P < 0.05) and depression (adjusted OR and 95% CI 2.83 (1.10-7.27), P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that, during the outbreak of COVID-19, sleep disturbance was highly prevalent among paediatric healthcare workers, and sleep disturbance was independently associated with being an only child, exposure to COVID-19 patients and depression.

Motivated by this limitation, we developed a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test using cellulose, an alternative membrane material, and a double-antigen sandwich format. Functionalized SARS-CoV-2 antigens were used as both capture and reporter binders, replacing the anti-human antibodies currently used in lateral flow tests. The test could provide enhanced sensitivity because it labels only antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the signal intensity is not diminished due to other human antibodies in serum. Three-dimensional channels in the assay were designed to have consistent flow rates and be easily manufactured by folding wax-printed paper.

Method: This study consists of two parts. The first part consists of working with a leader of a house of worship to formulate a decision process based on the priorities of the organization and its physical size and population. The second part involves the modeling of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus spread within a physical space to provide the leadership of the house of worship an estimate of the outcomes of deciding on various courses of action. The model is a modification of a standard virus model developed for the NetLogo programming environment. Results: The team worked with a large local church in Pennsylvania to physically reopen a worship service. Based on the questionnaire data, the congregation did not prefer the strongest form of the SARS-CoV-2 virus mitigation (mask wearing and social distancing) but favored either mask required and no social distancing or masks optional and social distancing. The team simulated conditions representative of the church and found that social distancing is the key factor to mitigate spread. Conclusion: Given the preferences of the congregation, our simulation results suggested that one of the favored options would likely yield a large number of infections (>10% in a scenario with an asymptomatic carrier). This information was provided to the leadership to guide their decision-making for the coming months as poor weather will rule out outdoor worship as a viable option.","Rothrock, Ling; Abraham, Aaron; Graf, Allison; Rodopman, Mina; Nold, Dan",,436,16

With globalization, a larger amount of N2O emissions arearticulated especially from human activities (30%, 6.7 Tg N per year), which are primarily dominated by agriculture that is even above the emissions of all oceans (26%). The synthesis of N2O reflects the general chemistry and readily from a substrate Nitric oxide (NO) in the environment. The modeling of infectious disease dynamics covering common pathogen-transmission factors, for example intrinsic (or microbes nutrient supply) at a population level, is indeed imperative to curb the menace of any disease. Nonetheless, in areas where novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was at its worst, for example, Wuhan China, Mumbai India, Milan Italy, Washington USA etc., the reduction in N2O emissions was well noticed. Nonetheless, viruses exhibit greater mobility than humans and hijack nutrients including nitrogen to complete their epidemiological cycle all due to limited sequence space of viral genomes, the high probability of genetic drift, extremely large population sizes, the high mutation and recombination rates. In consequence of drastic fall in N2O emissions, lower human transport can not be an all alone contributor, but contrarily it may also be associated with coronavirus intrinsic factors. This prompted us to analyze freely accessible and large global data from two authenticated sources, the World Health Organization and World Bank. We hereby argue that intrinsic factor N2O emissions fueling the COVID-19 progression significantly. Entire predictions were found consistent with the recently observed shreds of evidence. These insights enhanced scientific ability to interrogate viral epidemiology and recommended a 7-points framework covering all-natural lifestyle and dietary supplements for COVID-19 prevention before the arrival of a front-line therapeutic(s) or preventable vaccine.","Thapliyal, Nikita; Joshi, Gaurav; Gahtori, Prashant",,436,24

We present findings from a nationwide study in Argentina. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is disease severity measures and risk factors are associated with admission to an intensive care unit and mortality? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were extracted from the COVID-19 database of the Integrated Argentina Health Information System, encompassing the period of March 3rd to October 2nd, 2020, using a standardized case report form that included information on contact history, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical diagnosis. Information was collected at the initial site of care and follow-up conducted through calls by the regional healthcare authorities. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as having a positive result through sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. RESULTS: RT-PCR testing was positive in 738,776 cases. Complete datasets were available for analysis in 207,079 cases. Mean age was 42.9±18.8 years, 50.0% were males. Frequent co-existing conditions included hypertension (19.2%), diabetes (9.7%), asthma (6.1%) and obesity (5.2%). Most common symptoms included fever (58.5%), cough (58.0%), headache (45.4%), and sore throat (42.1%). Death or ICU admission were independently associated with older age, male, coma, dyspnea or tachypnea, and seizures, with underlying co-morbidities such as immunodeficiency, chronic renal failure, and liver disease showing the strongest effects. INTERPRETATION: Most cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Argentina were mild and had a favorable outcome, but fatality rates were relatively elevated. Risk factors for adverse outcome included older age, male sex, coma and seizures, and the concurrent presence of several morbidities. These data may be useful for healthcare providers and healthcare policy makers of low-middle income and Latin American countries to guide decisions toward optimized care during the pandemic.","Schönfeld, Daniel; Arias, Sergio; Bossio, Juan Carlos; Fernández, Hugo; Gozal, David; Pérez-Chada, Daniel",PLoS One,436,24

COVID-19 patients bear an elevated risk once the symptoms deteriorate. Hence, early recognition of diseased patients can facilitate early intervention and avoid disease succession. This article intends to develop a hybrid deep neural networks (HDNNs), using computed tomography (CT) and X-ray imaging, to predict the risk of the onset of disease in patients suffering from COVID-19. To be precise, the subjects were classified into 3 categories namely normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19. Initially, the CT and chest X-ray images, denoted as 'hybrid images' (with resolution 1080 × 1080) were collected from different sources, including GitHub, COVID-19 radiography database, Kaggle, COVID-19 image data collection, and Actual Med COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset, which are open source and publicly available data repositories. The 80% hybrid images were used to train the hybrid deep neural network model and the remaining 20% were used for the testing purpose. The capability and prediction accuracy of the HDNNs were calculated using the confusion matrix.

Using nationwide medical administrative data available prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection from the US Veterans Health Administration (VA), we developed the VA COVID-19 (VACO) 30-day mortality index and validated the index in two independent, prospective samples. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We reviewed SARS-CoV-2 testing results within the VA between February 8 and August 18, 2020. The sample was split into a development cohort (test positive between March 2 and April 15, 2020), an early validation cohort (test positive between April 16 and May 18, 2020), and a late validation cohort (test positive between May 19 and July 19, 2020). Our logistic regression model in the development cohort considered demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), and pre-existing medical conditions and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) derived from ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Weights were fixed to create the VACO Index that was then validated by comparing area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) in the early and late validation cohorts and among important validation cohort subgroups defined by sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region. We also evaluated calibration curves and the range of predictions generated within age categories. 13,323 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median age: 63 years; 91% male; 42% non-Hispanic Black). We observed 480/3,681 (13%) deaths in development, 253/2,151 (12%) deaths in the early validation cohort, and 403/7,491 (5%) deaths in the late validation cohort. Age, multimorbidity described with CCI, and a history of myocardial infarction or peripheral vascular disease were independently associated with mortality-no other individual comorbid diagnosis provided additional information. The VACO Index discriminated mortality in development (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.77-0.81), and in early (AUC = 0.81 95% CI: 0.78-0.83) and late (AUC = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.78-0.86) validation. The VACO Index allows personalized estimates of 30-day mortality after COVID-19 infection. For example, among those aged 60-64 years, overall mortality was estimated at 9% (95% CI: 6-11%). The Index further discriminated risk in this age stratum from 4% (95% CI: 3-7%) to 21% (95% CI: 12-31%), depending on sex and comorbid disease. CONCLUSION: Prior to infection, demographics and comorbid conditions can discriminate COVID-19 mortality risk overall and within age strata. The VACO Index reproducibly identified individuals at substantial risk of COVID-19 mortality who might consider continuing social distancing, despite relaxed state and local guidelines.","King, Joseph T; Yoon, James S; Rentsch, Christopher T; Tate, Janet P; Park, Lesley S; Kidwai-Khan, Farah; Skanderson, Melissa; Hauser, Ronald G; Jacobson, Daniel A; Erdos, Joseph; Cho, Kelly; Ramoni, Rachel; Gagnon, David R; Justice, Amy C",PLoS One,436,23

Consensus was achieved after multiple rounds of revisions between the writing committee and a larger expert group. A Delphi process involving the core group of authors (excluding the ECDC PHE team) identified the areas requiring review/consensus, followed by a second round to refine the definitive consensus elements.

In this study, we explore potential transmission events for multiple respiratory pathogens in a social contact network of university students. University students residing in on-campus housing (n = 590) were followed for the development of influenza-like illness for 10-weeks during the 2012-13 influenza season. A contact network was built using weekly self-reported contacts, class schedules, and housing information. We considered a transmission event to have occurred if students were positive for the same pathogen and had a network connection within a 14-day period. Transmitters were individuals who had onset date prior to their infected social contact. Throat and nasal samples were analysed for multiple viruses by RT-PCR. Five viruses were involved in 18 transmission events (influenza A, parainfluenza virus 3, rhinovirus, coronavirus NL63, respiratory syncytial virus). Transmitters had higher numbers of co-infections (67%). Identified transmission events had contacts reported in small classes (33%), dormitory common areas (22%) and dormitory rooms (17%). These results suggest that targeting person-to-person interactions, through measures such as isolation and quarantine, could reduce transmission of respiratory infections on campus.","Zivich, P N; Eisenberg, M C; Monto, A S; Uzicanin, A; Baric, R S; Sheahan, T P; Rainey, J J; Gao, H; Aiello, A E",Epidemiol Infect,436,19

We consider one such extraordinary proposal: 'safer infection sites' that would offer individuals the opportunity to be intentionally infected with SARS-CoV-2, isolate, and receive medical care until they are no longer infectious. Safer infection could have value for various groups of workers and students. Health professionals place themselves at risk of infection daily and extend this risk to their family members and community. Similarly, other essential workers who face workplace exposure must continue their work, even if have high-risk household members and live in fear of infecting. When schools are kept closed because of the fear that they will be sites of significant transmission, children and their families are harmed in multiple ways and college students who are living on campus, whether or not they are attending classes in person, are contributing to high rates of transmission and experiencing high rates of exposure. We consider whether offering safer infection sites to these groups could be ethically defensible and identify the empirical unknowns that would need to resolve before reaching definitive conclusions. This article is not an endorsement of intentional infection with the coronavirus, but rather is meant to spark conversation on the ethics of out-of-the-box proposals. Perhaps most meaningfully, our paper explores the value of control and peace of mind for those among us most impacted by the pandemic: those essential workers risking the most to keep us safe.","Hunt, Megan F; Clark, Katharine T; Geller, Gail; Barnhill, Anne",J. med. ethics,436,20

We aim to evaluate frequency and quality of facemask use in general populations. METHODS: A multi-site observational study was carried out from June to July 2020 in the west of France. An observer was positioned at a predetermined place, facing a landmark, and all individual passing between the observer and the landmark were included. The observer collected information on facemask use (type, quality of positioning), location and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 3354 observations were recorded. A facemask was worn by 56.4% (n = 1892) of individuals, including surgical facemasks (56.8%, n = 1075) and cloth masks (43.2%, n = 817). The facemask was correctly positioned in 75.2% (n = 1422) of cases. The factors independently associated with wearing a facemask were being indoors (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.28-3.19), being in a mandatory area (aOR, 6.92; 95% CI 5-9.7), female gender (aOR, 1.75; 95% CI 1.54-2.04), age 41-65 years (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI 1.43-2.02) and age > 65 years (aOR, 2.28; 95% CI 1.83-2.85). The factors independently associated with correct mask position were rural location (aOR, 1.38; 95% CI 1.07-1.79), being in an indoor area (aOR, 1.85; 95% CI 1.49-2.3), use of clothmask (aOR, 1.53; 95% CI 1.23-1.91), and age > 40 years (aOR, 1.75 95%CI 1.37-2.23). CONCLUSIONS: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the frequency and quality of facemask wearing remained low in the community setting.

We compared the presentation characteristics and outcomes of adults with and without HIV who were hospitalized with COVID-19 at 207 centers across the United Kingdom and whose data were prospectively captured by the ISARIC WHO CCP study. METHODS: We used Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression to describe the association between HIV status and day-28 mortality, after separate adjustment for sex, ethnicity, age, hospital acquisition of COVID-19 (definite hospital acquisition excluded), presentation date, ten individual comorbidities, and disease severity at presentation (as defined by hypoxia or oxygen therapy). RESULTS: Among 47,592 patients, 122 (0.26%) had confirmed HIV infection and 112/122 (91.8%) had a record of antiretroviral therapy. At presentation, HIV-positive people were younger (median 56 versus 74 years; p<0.001) and had fewer comorbidities, more systemic symptoms and higher lymphocyte counts and C-reactive protein levels. The cumulative day-28 mortality was similar in the HIV-positive vs. HIV-negative groups (26.7% vs. 32.1%; p=0.16), but in those under 60 years of age HIV-positive status was associated with increased mortality (21.3% vs. 9.6%; p<0.001 [log-rank test]).

Our research aimed to assess the mechanism of humanin (HN) in promoting autophagic degradation of Ox-LDL in HUVECs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Flow cytometry and lipid quantitation results showed that Ox-LDL caused lipid and cholesterol accumulation in HUVECs. Western blot results showed that Ox-LDL increased the expression of autophagy-related proteins P62 and LC3-II in a concentration-dependent manner. The cathepsin D activity assay showed that Ox-LDL inhibited the function of cathepsin D. HNG pretreatment reduced lipid and cholesterol aggregation in HUVECs induced by Ox-LDL, increased LC3-II protein level, decreased P62 protein content, and reversed Ox-LDL-induced cathepsin D functional impairment. Inhibition of the FPRL1 pathway by FPRL1 siRNA or the FPRL1-specific inhibitor Boc-MLF blocked all HNG's protective effects. These results indicate that HNG could restore cathepsin D activity and protein level in HUVECs to repair lysosomal functional damage induced by Ox-LDL, further repairing Ox-LDL-induced autophagic damage in HUVECs. CONCLUSION: HNG restores the activity of Ox-LDL-induced damaged lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D through its membrane protein receptor FPRL1 to promote autophagic degradation of Ox-LDL in HUVECs.","Ding, Yu; Feng, Yue; Zou, Yutian; Wang, Fen; Liu, Huihui; Liu, Chunfeng; Zhang, Yanlin",,436,4

A proper understanding of the magnitude and associated factors of persistent COVID-19 symptoms will go a long way in planning treatment and control strategies. Aim: To determine the proportion of patients who have persistent symptoms post-acute COVID-19 infection and to determine the factors associated with it, among those who have been discharged from Government Medical College, Thrissur. Materials and Methods: The current cross-sectional study was conducted among 335 patients who were admitted and discharged with COVID-19 infection in Government Medical College, Thrissur, Kerala, a tertiary care institution in southern India between December 2020 and February 2021. They were contacted through a telephonic interview 28 days from symptom onset through a semi-structured interview schedule. The questions included basic demographic details, symptomatology at admission, persistent symptoms at 28 days after onset and other clinical details including comorbidities. For defining post-COVID-19 symptom persistence National Institute for Health and Care (NICE) guidelines were used. Association between persistent symptoms and selected factors was done by Chi-square test. Results: Out of the 335 patients, the persistence of symptoms of COVID-19 infection after 28days of symptom onset was 221 (66%) C.I -60.7-70.8%). Persistence of two or more COVID-19 symptoms after 28 days of onset was seen in 120 (35.8%). The most common persistent symptoms among the patients were fatigue in 109 (32.5%) of people followed by dyspnoea in 77 (23%), cough in 45 (13.4%) and myalgia in 37 (11%) patients Highest persistence was seen in Category C patients where symptoms were persisting in 75%. Persistence was also higher in those with diabetes mellitus, those who received oxygen support and those who were in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or ventilator and the association was statistically significant(p-value&lt;0.05).

It is unclear whether patients with seropositivity represent the subgroup with robust health status, who would be more likely to mount a durable antibody response. Using data from a July 2020 sample of 28,503 patients receiving dialysis, we evaluated the cross-sectional association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with laboratory surrogates of patient health. In separate logistic regression models, we assessed the association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with seven laboratory-based covariates (albumin, creatinine, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone), across the entire range of the laboratory and in comparison to a referent value. Models accounted for age, sex, region, race and ethnicity, and county-level COVID-19 deaths per 100,000. Odds of seropositivity for albumin 3 and 3.5 g/dL were 2.1 (95% CI 1.9-2.3) and 1.3 (1.2-1.4) respectively, compared with 4 g/dL. Odds of seropositivity for serum creatinine 5 and 8 mg/dL were 1.8 (1.6-2.0) and 1.3 (1.2-1.4) respectively, compared with 12.5 mg/dL. Lower values of hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone were associated with higher odds of seropositivity.

The observed nitrate aerosols have not exhibited a significant decreasing trend and constituted a major fraction (about 20%) of the total PM2.5, although the surface-measured NO2 concentration has decreased by over 20%. The contributions of nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions mitigation to the nitrate and PM2.5 concentrations and how to alleviate nitrate aerosols efficiently under the current situation still remains elusive. The WRF-Chem model simulations of a persistent and heavy PM pollution episode in January 2019 in the BTH reveal that NOX emissions mitigation does not help lower wintertime nitrate and PM2.5 concentrations under current conditions in the BTH. A 50% reduction in NOX emissions only decreases nitrate mass by 10.3% but increases PM2.5 concentrations by 3.2%, because the substantial O3 increase induced by NOX mitigation offsets the HNO3 loss and enhances sulfate and secondary organic aerosols formation. Our results are further consolidated by the occurrence of severe PM pollution in the BTH during the COVID-19 outbreak, with a significant reduction in NO2 concentration. Mitigation of NH3 emissions constitutes the priority measure to effectively lower the nitrate and PM2.5 concentrations in the BTH under current conditions, with 35.5% and 12.7% decrease, respectively, when NH3 emissions are reduced by 50%.","Li, Xia; Bei, Naifang; Hu, Bo; Wu, Jiarui; Pan, Yuepeng; Wen, Tianxue; Liu, Zirui; Liu, Lang; Wang, Ruonan; Li, Guohui",Environ Pollut,436,14

The complex molecular cascade of events related to the viral pathogenicity is triggered by the Spike protein upon interacting with the ACE2 receptor on human lung cells through its receptor binding domain (RBDSpike). One potential therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19 could thus be limiting the infection by blocking this key interaction. In this current study, we adopt a protein design approach to predict and propose non-virulent structural mimics of the RBDSpike which can potentially serve as its competitive inhibitors in binding to ACE2. The RBDSpike is an independently foldable protein domain, resilient to conformational changes upon mutations and therefore an attractive target for strategic re-design. Interestingly, in spite of displaying an optimal shape fit between their interacting surfaces (attributed to a consequently high mutual affinity), the RBDSpike-ACE2 interaction appears to have a quasi-stable character due to a poor electrostatic match at their interface. Structural analyses of homologous protein complexes reveal that the ACE2 binding site of RBDSpike has an unusually high degree of solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues, attributed to key evolutionary changes, making it inherently ""reaction-prone."" The designed mimics aimed to block the viral entry by occupying the available binding sites on ACE2, are tested to have signatures of stable high-affinity binding with ACE2 (cross-validated by appropriate free energy estimates), overriding the native quasi-stable feature. The results show the apt of directly adapting natural examples in rational protein design, wherein, homology-based threading coupled with strategic ""hydrophobic â polar"" mutations serve as a potential breakthrough.","Basu, Sankar; Chakravarty, Devlina; Bhattacharyya, Dhananjay; Saha, Pampa; Patra, Hirak K",J Mol Model,436,16

Endothelial cells express Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the entrance door for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The hallmarks of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are increased levels of IL-6, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, neutrophilia and lymphopenia, pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy and microthrombi of alveolar capillaries. The endothelial glycocalyx, a proteoglycan- and glycoprotein-rich layer covering the luminal side of endothelial cells, contributes to vascular homeostasis. It regulates vascular tonus and permeability, prevents thrombosis, and modulates leukocyte adhesion and inflammatory response. We hypothesized that cytokine production and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation associated with COVID-19 leads to glycocalyx degradation. A cohort of 20 hospitalized patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Mechanisms associated with glycocalyx degradation in COVID-19 were investigated. Increased plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL1-ß, as well as increased lipid peroxidation and glycocalyx components were detected in plasma from COVID-19 patients compared to plasma from healthy subjects. Plasma from COVID-19 patients induced glycocalyx shedding in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and disrupted redox balance. Treatment of HUVECs with low molecular weight heparin inhibited the glycocalyx perturbation. In conclusion, plasma from COVID-19 patients promotes glycocalyx shedding and redox imbalance in endothelial cells, and heparin treatment potentially inhibits glycocalyx disruption.","Potje, Simone R; Costa, Tiago J; Fraga-Silva, Thais F C; Martins, Ronaldo B; Benatti, Maira N; Almado, Carlos E L; de Sá, Keyla S G; Bonato, Vânia L D; Arruda, Eurico; Louzada-Junior, Paulo; Oliveira, Rene D R; Zamboni, Dario S; Becari, Christiane; Auxiliadora-Martins, Maria; Tostes, Rita C",Life Sci,436,30

However, little is known about a serious health-risk-behavior named ""food and alcohol disturbance"" (FAD), characterized by engaging in dysfunctional eating on days of planned alcohol consumption. The aim of the present study was to investigate potential factors that may have put young adults at risk or protected against FAD during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: A sample of 447 young adults (280 females, 167 males; range 18-26) completed an online survey during the country's nationwide lockdown composed of self-reported measures assessing FAD behaviors, alcohol consumption, compensatory behaviors, eating and weight concerns, social support, emotion regulation strategies, and living arrangement. RESULTS: Our findings showed that FAD was significantly and positively correlated to alcohol consumption, use of laxatives, self-induced vomiting, eating and weight concerns, and expressive suppression, and negatively correlated to social support and living with family. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that alcohol consumption, eating concern, and expression suppression positively predicted FAD, while social support and living with family were negative predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that during the COVID-19 lockdown, preoccupation with eating and the use of expressive suppression may have increased vulnerability to FAD; conversely, perceived social support and living with family may have been a source of protection against this dysfunctional behavior.

A total of 232 Korean and 303 Taiwanese responses were analyzed to examine the structural relationships among four key variables using structural equation modelling in AMOS 20. This study confirms that more parental stress leads to worse QoL. However, more parental stress results in less frequent participation in OCs, and OC use exerts a negative influence on QoL, which contradicts the hypothesized positive correlations. In comparison among Korean and Taiwanese mothers, Korean respondents showed a stronger influence of parental stress to mobilize more social support than did Taiwanese.

Our research intent is to understand how branded app quality counters perceived counterfeit deception (PCD) and engenders trust while analyzing consumer willingness to buy (WillB) in an emerging market. This work captures the perception of 1,146 online shoppers through a questionnaire-based survey and uses SPSSv23 and Amos 21 to construct a structural equation model to test the conceptual model. The results indicate that information quality (IQ), system quality (SysQ), and service quality (ServQ) of branded apps negatively affect PCD, and IQ and SysQ positively affect consumers’ trust in the seller. The study establishes stronger effects of SysQ and ServQ on PCD than on trust, and alongside this, a stronger effect of IQ on trust than on PCD is witnessed. Hence, the study proves that ServQ and SysQ are sale qualifiers and IQ is a sale enabler in counterfeiting contexts. A strong direct negative effect of PCD on WillB seems to overwhelm the positive effect of trust on WillB. The study makes several theoretical contributions, including toward the established literature on two factor theory and trust theory.

DESIGN: We examined the reliability and internal validity of the ELCSA scale in three repeated waves of cross-sectional surveys with Rasch models. We estimated the monthly prevalence of food insecurity in the general population and in households with and without children and compared them with a national 2018 survey. We tested concurrent validity by testing associations of food insecurity with socio-economic status and anxiety. SETTING: ENCOVID-19 is a monthly telephone cross-sectional survey collecting information on the well-being of Mexican households during the pandemic lockdown. Surveys used probabilistic samples, and we used data from April (n 833), May (n 850) and June 2020 (n 1674). PARTICIPANTS: Mexicans 18 years or older who had a mobile telephone. RESULTS: ELCSA had an adequate model fit and food insecurity was associated, within each wave, with more poverty and anxiety. The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with an important reduction in food security, decreasing stepwise from 38·9 % in 2018 to 24·9 % in June 2020 in households with children. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone surveys were a feasible strategy to monitor reductions in food security during the COVID-19 lockdown.","Gaitán-Rossi, Pablo; Vilar-Compte, Mireya; Teruel, Graciela; Pérez-Escamilla, Rafael",Public Health Nutr,436,5

It has been used for centuries for the treatment of fever and chills, and has been recently approved for the treatment of malaria due to its endoperoxidase properties. Progressively, research has found that artemisinins displayed multiple pharmacological actions against inflammation, viral infections, and cell and tumour proliferation, making it effective against diseases. Moreover, it has displayed a relatively safe toxicity profile. The use of artemisinins against different respiratory diseases has been investigated in lung cancer models and inflammatory-driven respiratory disorders. These studies revealed the ability of artemisinins in attenuating proliferation, inflammation, invasion, and metastasis, and in inducing apoptosis. Artemisinins can regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#954;B), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promote cell cycle arrest, drive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and induce Bak or Bax-dependent or independent apoptosis. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive update of the current knowledge of the effects of artemisinins in relation to respiratory diseases to identify gaps that need to be filled in the course of repurposing artemisinins for the treatment of respiratory diseases. In addition, we postulate whether artemisinins can also be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19 given its anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties.","Cheong, Dorothy H J; Tan, Daniel W S; Wong, Fred W S; Tran, Thai",Pharmacol Res,436,26

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of HCQ and other immunosuppressive drugs on the incidence of COVID-19. Methods: The data were collected from the South Korea National Health Insurance Sharing-COVID-19 database. All individuals who underwent nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab tests for COVID-19 from January 2020 to May 2020 are included. The association between COVID-19 risk and HCQ use was examined in a propensity score-matched population. Factors associated with COVID-19 were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: Total 8,070 patients with COVID-19 and 121,050 negative controls were included from the database. Among all participants, 381 were HCQ users. In a propensity score-matched population, the incidence of COVID-19 was 7.1% in HCQ users and 6.8% in non-users.

Surgical branch pulmonary artery angioplasty is associated with a high reintervention rate. As an alternative, percutaneous or intraoperative branch pulmonary artery stents have been implanted to improve efficiency, but long-term evaluations are limited. AIM: To describe the long-term evolution of branch pulmonary artery stents. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at Tours University Hospital. All stents implanted by surgery or catheterization in branch pulmonary arteries with a minimum follow-up of 12 months and at least one catheterization control were included. The primary endpoint combined cardiovascular mortality, surgical or percutaneous reintervention for stent complication or new stent implantation. RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2017, 76 stents in 51 patients were included (62 stents implanted by surgery, 14 by catheterization). At implantation, the patients' mean age and weight were 4.7years (interquartile range 4.2years) and 17.3kg (interquartile range 11.0kg), respectively. Mean branch pulmonary artery minimum diameter was 4.1±2.1mm (mean Z-score-4.9±2.9), and mean initial stent diameter was 9.1±3.1mm. During a follow-up of 5.3years (range 0-11.2 years), freedom from primary endpoint was 86.8% (95% confidence interval 79.6-94.8%) at 1 year, 71.5% (95% confidence interval 61.9-82.7%) at 5years and 69.6% (95% confidence interval 59.6-81.2%) at 10 years. We did not identify any factors associated with major adverse cardiovascular events. Among stents without major adverse cardiovascular events, the mean branch pulmonary artery diameter Z-score at last evaluation had increased by +4.8±3.2 compared with the initial diameter (P<0.001). After stent implantation, a median of 2 re-expansions were performed for each stent (range 0-7). CONCLUSIONS: Stent implantation should offer a good long-term solution for branch pulmonary artery stenosis, although iterative re-expansions are required.","Ma, Iris; El Arid, Jean-Marc; Neville, Paul; Soule, Nathalie; Dion, Fanny; Poinsot, Jacques; Chantepie, Alain; Lefort, Bruno",Arch.

Early COVID-19 detection among healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial for protecting patients and the healthcare workforce. Because of limited testing capacity, symptom-based screening may prioritize testing and increase diagnostic accuracy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a retrospective study of HCWs undergoing both COVID-19 telephonic symptom screening and nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 assays during the period, March 9-April 15, 2020. HCWs with negative assays but progressive symptoms were re-tested for SARS-CoV-2. Among 592 HCWs tested, 83 (14%) had an initial positive SARS-CoV-2 assay. Fifty-nine of 61 HCWs (97%) who were asymptomatic or reported only sore throat/nasal congestion had negative SARS-CoV-2 assays (P = 0.006). HCWs reporting three or more symptoms had an increased multivariate-adjusted odds of having positive assays, 1.95 (95% CI: 1.10-3.64), which increased to 2.61 (95% CI: 1.50-4.45) for six or more symptoms. The multivariate-adjusted odds of a positive assay were also increased for HCWs reporting fever and a measured temperature &#8805; 37.5°C (3.49 (95% CI: 1.95-6.21)), and those with myalgias (1.83 (95% CI: 1.04-3.23)). Anosmia/ageusia (i.e. loss of smell/loss of taste) was reported less frequently (16%) than other symptoms by HCWs with positive assays, but was associated with more than a seven-fold multivariate-adjusted odds of a positive test: OR = 7.21 (95% CI: 2.95-17.67). Of 509 HCWs with initial negative SARS-CoV-2 assays, nine had symptom progression and positive re-tests, yielding an estimated negative predictive value of 98.2% (95% CI: 96.8-99.0%) for the exclusion of clinically relevant COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom and temperature reports are useful screening tools for predicting SARS-CoV-2 assay results in HCWs. Anosmia/ageusia, fever, and myalgia were the strongest independent predictors of positive assays. The absence of symptoms or symptoms limited to nasal congestion/sore throat were associated with negative assays.","Lan, Fan-Yun; Filler, Robert; Mathew, Soni; Buley, Jane; Iliaki, Eirini; Bruno-Murtha, Lou Ann; Osgood, Rebecca; Christophi, Costas A; Fernandez-Montero, Alejandro; Kales, Stefanos N",PLoS One,436,14

Changes in modes of instruction have presented psychosocial stressors to children and parents that can increase risks to mental health and well-being and might exacerbate educational and health disparities (1,2). CDC examined differences in child and parent experiences and indicators of well-being according to children's mode of school instruction (i.e., in-person only [in-person], virtual-only [virtual], or combined virtual and in-person [combined]) using data from the COVID Experiences nationwide survey. During October 8-November 13, 2020, parents or legal guardians (parents) of children aged 5-12 years were surveyed using the NORC at the University of Chicago AmeriSpeak panel,* a probability-based panel designed to be representative of the U.S. household population. Among 1,290 respondents with a child enrolled in public or private school, 45.7% reported that their child received virtual instruction, 30.9% in-person instruction, and 23.4% combined instruction. For 11 of 17 stress and well-being indicators concerning child mental health and physical activity and parental emotional distress, findings were worse for parents of children receiving virtual or combined instruction than were those for parents of children receiving in-person instruction. Children not receiving in-person instruction and their parents might experience increased risk for negative mental, emotional, or physical health outcomes and might need additional support to mitigate pandemic effects. Community-wide actions to reduce COVID-19 incidence and support mitigation strategies in schools are critically important to support students' return to in-person learning.","Verlenden, Jorge V; Pampati, Sanjana; Rasberry, Catherine N; Liddon, Nicole; Hertz, Marci; Kilmer, Greta; Viox, Melissa Heim; Lee, Sarah; Cramer, Neha K; Barrios, Lisa C; Ethier, Kathleen A",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,436,16

This presents an opportunity to examine the nature of the misinformation and disinformation being produced, and the theoretical and technological paradigm used to counter it. I argue that this approach is based on a conception of misinformation as epistemic pollution that can only justify a limited and potentially inadequate response , and that some of the measures undertaken in practice outrun this. In fact, social networks manage ecological and architectural conditions that influence discourse on their platforms in ways that should motivate reconsideration of the justifications that ground epistemic interventions to combat misinformation, and the types of intervention that they warrant. The editorial role of platforms should not be framed solely as the management of epistemic pollution, but instead as managing the epistemic environment in which narratives and social epistemic processes take place. There is an element of inevitable epistemic paternalism involved in this, and exploration of the independent constraints on its justifiability can help determine proper limits of its exercise in practice.","Buzzell, Andrew",,436,16

The detrimental effects of DM2 over executive function (EF) performance may be mediated by factors such as cognitive reserve (CR). CR mediates cognitive performance by delaying the appearance of clinical symptoms from subjacent brain pathology or attenuating the severity of such symptoms. Our main goal was to study the effects of CR on executive functions of adults with DM2. Methods: Data from a total of 1,034 adults were included (362 women, 672 men). Subjects were categorized into four groups: subjects with DM2 and high CR (n = 235), control subjects with high CR (n = 265), subjects with DM2 and low CR (n = 298), and control subjects with low CR (n = 236). CR was quantified through 3 proxies: education, occupational complexity, and leisure activities. Executive functions were evaluated through visual scanning, verbal fluency, and backwards counting tasks. First, a series of four one-way ANOVAs was performed where group was included as a between-subject factor and executive function as a dependent variable. Second, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to assess the weight of each CR proxy on EF performance. Results: CR level significantly affected all executive function scores independently of the diabetes status. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that years of education accounted for most of the variance in the model for executive function performance. In this study, we found that there is a significant effect of CR on executive function performance of DM2 subjects and education is the most important CR proxy.","Peña-González, Paola; Mondragón-Maya, Alejandra; Silva-Pereyra, Juan; Roa-Rojas, Paloma",J Diabetes Res,436,24

Coronavirus has also caused many problems in hospitals, where these are no longer able to accommodate a large number of patients. This virus has also begun to spread between medical and paramedical teams, and this causes a major risk to the health of patients staying in hospitals. To reduce the spread of the virus and maintain the health of patients who need a hospital stay, home hospitalization is one of the best possible solutions. This paper proposes a home hospitalization system based on the Internet of Things (IoT), Fog computing, and Cloud computing, which are among the most important technologies that have contributed to the development of the healthcare sector in a significant way. These systems allow patients to recover and receive treatment in their homes and among their families, where patient health and the hospitalization room environmental state are monitored, to enable doctors to follow the hospitalization process and make recommendations to patients and their supervisors, through monitoring units and mobile applications developed for this purpose. The results of evaluation have shown great acceptance of this system by patients and doctors alike.","Ben Hassen, Hafedh; Ayari, Nadia; Hamdi, Belgacem",Inform. Med. Unlocked,436,1

Epidemiological data, information on COVID-19 infection related to surgery and clinical characteristics of non-survival operative patients with COVID-19 infections were analyzed. RESULTS: From 213 patients analyzed, Covid-19 symptoms were noticed in 8 patients at preoperative process or at hospital admission postponing operation; 161 patients were submitted to elective surgery and 44 to emergency surgery. From patients submitted to elective surgeries, we had 1 patient with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 (0,6%), with mild symptoms and quick discharge.

From this information, their abundance, size, molar mass, density and anisotropy can be determined. The accuracy with which these parameters can be determined depends in part on the accuracy of the radial position recordings and the boundary conditions used in the modeling of the AUC data. The AUC instrument can spin samples at speeds up to 60,000 rpm, generating forces approaching 300,000 g. Forces of this magnitude will stretch the titanium rotors used in the instrument, shifting the boundary conditions required to solve the flow equations used in the modeling of the AUC data. A second source of error is caused by the chromatic aberration resulting from imperfections in the UV-visible absorption optics. Both errors are larger than the optical resolution of currently available instrumentation. Here, we report software routines that correct these errors, aided by a new calibration disk which can be used in place of the counterbalance to provide a calibration reference for each experiment to verify proper operation of the AUC instrument. We describe laboratory methods and software routines in UltraScan that incorporate calibrations and corrections for the rotor stretch and chromatic aberration in order to support Good Manufacturing Practices for AUC data analysis.","Stoutjesdyk, Marielle; Henrickson, Amy; Minors, Geoff; Demeler, Borries",Eur.

Covid-19 required the urgency of a new psychological intervention model to better address the crisis and ensure a direct support response to the people involved in the pandemic. The present study aimed to detect the symptoms and reactions of the population with respect to the event. The survey was carried out by describing the clinical symptoms that emerged from the triage card used by SIPEM SoS Emilia Romagna (Italy), connoting the criteria of emergency psychology. METHODS: A retrospective quantitative study was conducted on 288 psychological triage cards. RESULTS: only 11% of users who ask for support say they are positive while 85% report not having contracted the virus. Of the total, 40.9% call for psychological support in the management of anxiety symptoms, a need also reported by 55% of the subsample who declared previous psychological problems. In reaction to the pandemic event, 51.1% of the total refers to coping resources and availability for help. DISCUSSIONS: the need for support of the population to manage symptoms highlights the need for early interventions, also to facilitate that slice of the population that does not have effective individual coping strategies and resources available to help. CONCLUSIONS: it can be deduced that interventions during these types of emergencies must be timely and aimed not only at those affected but also at the general population.","Cervellione, Brenda; Rossi, Sandra; Carbone, Roberta; Ferracane, Giuseppina; Lombardo, Ester M C; Pedrelli, Enrica; Sozzi, Anna; Artioli, Giovanna; Sarli, Leopoldo; Iacolino, Calogero",Acta Biomed,436,26

The reason is that the early patients recover or die before the peak of the epidemic, which flattens the peak. This improves welfare if the peak exceeds the capacity of the healthcare system and the social loss rises rapidly enough in the number infected. The individual incentive to get infected early comes from the greater likelihood of receiving treatment than at the peak when the disease has overwhelmed healthcare capacity. Calibration to the Covid-19 pandemic data suggests that catching the infection at the start was individually optimal and for some loss functions would have reduced the aggregate loss.","Heinsalu, Sander",,436,19

OBJECTIVE: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of 33 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who received painless fiberoptic bronchoscopy in Wuhan First Hospital. The general demographic and clinical data of the patients including age, gender, and ASA classification were collected. The patients received intravenous anesthesia with topical airway anesthesia with lidocaine. The changes in the vital signs of the patients were recorded before, during and after the procedure. The cough intensity of the patients during bronchoscopy were evaluated, and the adverse reactions within 24 h after the procedure were observed. The health status of the medical staff carrying out the procedure was also monitored. OBJECTIVE: The 33 patients with ASA class â ¡ to â £ included 19 male and 14 female patients with an average age of 63.58±11.85 years. The lowest SpO2 of the patients during bronchoscopy was (94.8±4.3)%, which was significantly lower than that before the procedure [(99.1±1.3)%, P < 0.05] but was restored to more than 95% after such treatment as holding the jaw to open the airway or face mask positive-pressure ventilation. Bronchoscopy was completed successfully in all the patients, and 28 patients (84.85%) had mild cough during the procedure. None of the patients had obvious complications related to anesthesia. While performing the procedure, all the medical staff used third-level protection and facial protection with powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR), and the patients' face were covered with single-use sterile medical plastic curtains that were originally intended for collecting flushing fluid during arthroscopic procedures. No medical personnel was diagnosed with COVID-19 at the end of the study. OBJECTIVE: For patients with COVID-19, painless techniques can be valuable during bronchoscopy, and this procedure can be safe and feasible under third-level protection.","Wang, J; Yang, S; Chen, J; Chen, Z",Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,436,16

The limitations of protocol-driven medical science and avoiding the patient behind the patient have again compelled us during this pandemic to explore holistic health. This paper presents an analysis and explores the feasibility of Ayurveda as an integrative system to wellness and tests the Ayurveda concept of holistic wellness against three such dichotomies: 'health' vs wellness, 'body' vs 'mind,' and 'curative vs. preventive,' where the current medical model can be said to represent the first elements in the three dichotomies. Keeping the current Covid-19 pandemic as a critical incident, researchers tried to justify that the synergistic confluence will act as a complementary/supportive knowledge in humanity's struggle against the pandemic.

In this study, we investigate the potential clinical utility of lymphocyte CPD for early diagnosis of COVID-19. To investigate the potential of lymphocyte cell population data (lymphocyte CPD) for use in early diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Lymphocyte CPD of healthy control (n = 51), common cold patients (n = 49) and mild COVID-19 patients (n = 126) were generated using hematology analyzer. The parameters were subjected to sensitivity and specificity analysis to determine their suitability as biomarkers for early diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Normality analysis showed that lymphocyte CPD followed a normal distribution. There were no significant differences in white blood cells (WBC) and lymphocyte (LY#) counts as well as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) among the groups (p &gt; 0.05). Lymphocyte volume standard deviation (LV-SD), lymphocyte conductivity standard deviation (LC-SD) and lymphocyte light scatter standard deviation (LS-SD) were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than in common cold and control groups (p &lt; 0.05). The corresponding mean lymphocyte light scattering (MLS) was significantly reduced in the COVID-19 group, relative to the common cold group, but was significantly increased, when compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, there was no significant difference in mean lymphocyte volume (MLV) between the COVID-19 group and the common cold or control group (p &gt; 0.05), but it was significantly higher in the common cold group than in the control group (p &lt; 0.05).

However, few data have been reported thus far on measurements upstream of WWTPs, i.e. throughout the sewer network. In this study, the monitoring of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Prague wastewater was carried out at selected locations of the Prague sewer network from August 2020 through May 2021. Various locations such as residential areas of various sizes, hospitals, city center areas, student dormitories, transportation hubs (airport, bus terminal), and commercial areas were monitored together with four of the main Prague sewers. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was determined by reverse transcription - multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-mqPCR) after the precipitation of nucleic acids with PEG8000 and RNA isolation with TRIzol Reagent. The number of copies of the gene encoding SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N1) per liter of wastewater was compared with the number of officially registered COVID-19 cases in Prague. Although the data obtained by sampling wastewater from the major Prague sewers were more consistent than those obtained from the small sewers, the correlation between wastewater-based and clinical-testing data was also good for the residential areas with more than 1 000 registered inhabitants. It was shown that monitoring SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater sampled from small sewers could identify isolated occurrences of COVID-19-positive cases in local neighborhoods.

The objective of this study was to estimate the total discounted money value of human life losses (TDMVCL MAURITIUS ) associated with COVID-19 in Mauritius. Methods: The human capital approach (HCA) was used to estimate the TDMVCL MAURITIUS of the 10 human life losses linked with COVID-19 in Mauritius as of 16 October 2020. The HCA model was estimated with the national life expectancy of 75.51 years and a discount rate of 3%. A sensitivity analysis was performed assuming (a) 5 and 10% discount rates, and (b) the average world life expectancy of 73.2 years, and the world highest life expectancy of 88.17 years. Results: The money value of human lives lost to COVID-19, at a discounted rate of 3%, had an estimated TDMVCL MAURITIUS of Int$ 3,120,689, and an average of Int$ 312,069 per human life lost. Approximately 74% of the TDMVCL MAURITIUS accrued to persons aged between 20 and 59 years. Reanalysis of the model with 5 and 10% discount rates, holding national life expectancy constant, reduced the TDMVCL MAURITIUS by 19.0 and 45.5%, respectively. Application of the average world life expectancy at 3% discount rate reduced TDMVCL MAURITIUS by 13%; and use of the world highest life expectancy at 3% discount rate increased TDMVCL MAURITIUS by 50%. Conclusions: The average discounted money value per human life loss associated with COVID-19 is 12-fold the per capita GDP for Mauritius. All measures implemented to prevent widespread community transmission of COVID-19 may have saved the country 837 human lives worth Int$258,080,991.

This paper investigates change in patterns of mortality at local authority level in England (2010-11 to 2017-18) and the relation with fiscal austerity measures. METHODS: Data from official local authority administrative records are used to quantify the gap between observed deaths and what was anticipated in the 2010-based subnational population projections. Regression analyses are used to explore the relation between excess deaths, austerity and wider process of population change at local authority level. RESULTS: We estimate 231 707 total excess deaths, the majority of which occurred since 2014-15 (89%) across the majority of local authorities (91%). Austerity is positively associated with excess deaths. For working age adults, there is a clear gradient to the impact of austerity, whereas for older adults, the impact is more uniform.

Clinical findings on COVID-19 show that many patients had dangerously low blood oxygen levels not long before conditions worsened. It is therefore recommended, especially for the vulnerable population, to regularly monitor the blood oxygen level for precaution. Recent works have investigated how ubiquitous smartphone cameras can be used to infer SpO$_2$. Most of these works are contact-based, requiring users to cover a phone's camera and its nearby light source with a finger to capture reemitted light from the illuminated tissue. Contact-based methods may lead to skin irritation and sanitary concerns, especially during a pandemic. In this paper, we propose a noncontact method for SpO$_2$ monitoring using hand videos acquired by smartphones. Considering the optical broadband nature of the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) color channels of the smartphone cameras, we exploit all three channels of RGB sensing to distill the SpO$_2$ information beyond the traditional ratio-of-ratios (RoR) method that uses only two wavelengths. To further facilitate an accurate SpO$_2$ prediction, we design adaptive narrow bandpass filters based on accurately estimated heart rate to obtain the most cardiac-related AC component for each color channel. Experimental results show that our proposed blood oxygen estimation method can reach a mean absolute error of 1.26% when a pulse oximeter is used as a reference, outperforming the traditional RoR method by 25%.","Tian, Xin; Wong, Chau-Wai; Ranadive, Sushant M.; Wu, Min",,436,6

METHODS AND RESULTS: Herein, we reported the isolation of A. terreus, the endophytic fungus associated with soybean roots, which is then subcultured using OSMAC approach in five different culture media. Analytical analysis of media ethylacetate extracts using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) was carried out. Furthermore, the obtained LC-MS data were statistically processed with MetaboAnalyst 4.0. Molecular docking studies were performed for the dereplicated metabolites against COVID-19 main protease (Mpro ). Metabolomic profiling revealed the presence of 18 compounds belonging to different chemical classes. Quinones, polyketides and isocoumarins were the most abundant classes. Multivariate analysis revealed that potato dextrose broth and modified potato dextrose broth are the optimal media for metabolites production. Molecular docking studies declared that the metabolites, Aspergillide B1 and 3a-Hydroxy-3, 5-dihydromonacolin L showed the highest binding energy scores towards COVID-19 main protease (Mpro ) (-9·473) and (-9·386), respectively, and they interact strongly with the catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) amino acid residues of Mpro . CONCLUSIONS: A combination of metabolomics and in-silico approaches have allowed a shorter route to search for anti-COVID-19 natural products in a shorter time. The dereplicated metabolites, aspergillide B1 and 3&#945;-Hydroxy-3, 5-dihydromonacolin L were found to be potent anti-COVID-19 drug candidates in the molecular docking study.

In this study, we tested the effectiveness of a life skills based health promotion intervention KHOTWA (STEP) in enhancing the wellbeing of university students in Lebanon, a country that faces economic and political instability. This is a quasi-experimental study, with pre and post-test, intervention-control design. Each group was formed of 78 participants studying in a private university in Lebanon. Mixed design was used to address the process and outcomes objectives of the intervention. The program was carried online due to COVID-19 pandemic. Significant differences were observed between the intervention and the control groups for life skills, dietary habits and mental health scores at the 3-month follow-up. For the intervention group, a significant increase was observed in the mean score of each of the following Life Skills subscales: self-care (p = 0.001), work and study (p = 0.013), career and education planning (p = 0.011) and looking forward/goal settings (p &lt; 0.001). Students also achieved a healthier eating habit compared to those in the control group by decreasing their consumption of processed food. There was no significant effect in terms of body mass index (p = 0.827). Also, there was a significant change in the mental health status (p = 0.012) only in the intervention group as its mean score decreased after 3 months of the intervention implementation. This intervention enhances the mental health and promotes healthy habits leading consequently to a better quality of life and more productivity amongst university students. Therefore, such interventions should be replicated in other similar context to improve university students’ well-being. © The Author(s) 2021.","Maddah, D.; Saab, Y.; Safadi, H.; Abi Farraj, N.; Hassan, Z.; Turner, S.; Echeverri, L.; Alami, N.

On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On February 28, WHO increased our assessment of the risk of spread and the risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at a global level. The COVID-19 poses significant threats to international health.Computed tomography (CT) has been an important imaging modality in assisting in the diagnosis and management of patients withCOVID-19. Some retrospective imaging studies have reported chest CT findings of COVID-19 in the past 2 months, suggesting that several CT findings may be characteristic. To our knowledge, there has been no prospective multicentre imaging study of COVID-19 to date.We proposed a hypothesis: There are some specific CT features on Chest CT of COVID-19 patients. And the mechanism of these CT features is explicable based on pathological findings. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the specific CT features of COVID-19 and the formation mechanism of these CT features. METHOD: This study is a prospective multicenter observational study. We will recruit 100 patients with COVID-19 at 55 hospitals. All patients undergo chest CT examination with the same scan protocol. The distribution and morphology of lesions on chest CT, clinical data will be recorded. A number of patients will be pathologically examined after permission is granted. The data of these three aspects will be analyzed synthetically. DISCUSSION: This study will help us to identify the chest CT features of COVID-19 and its mechanism.

However, numerically reported test results make rapid interpretation difficult or open to interpretation. The arterial blood gas algorithm (ABG-a) is a new digital diagnostics solution that can provide clinicians with real-time interpretation of preliminary data on safety features, oxygenation, acid-base disturbances and renal profile. The main aim of this study was to clinically validate the algorithm against senior experienced clinicians, for acid-base interpretation, in a clinical context. METHODS: We conducted a prospective international multicentre observational cross-sectional study. 346 sample sets and 64 inpatients eligible for ABG met strict sampling criteria. Agreement was evaluated using Cohen's kappa index, diagnostic accuracy was evaluated with sensitivity, specificity, efficiency or global accuracy and positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for the prevalence in the study population. RESULTS: The concordance rates between the interpretations of the clinicians and the ABG-a for acid-base disorders were an observed global agreement of 84,3% with a Cohen's kappa coefficient 0.81; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.86; p < 0.001. For detecting accuracy normal acid-base status the algorithm has a sensitivity of 90.0% (95% CI 79.9 to 95.3), a specificity 97.2% (95% CI 94.5 to 98.6) and a global accuracy of 95.9% (95% CI 93.3 to 97.6). For the four simple acid-base disorders, respiratory alkalosis: sensitivity of 91.2 (77.0 to 97.0), a specificity 100.0 (98.8 to 100.0) and global accuracy of 99.1 (97.5 to 99.7); respiratory acidosis: sensitivity of 61.1 (38.6 to 79.7), a specificity of 100.0 (98.8 to 100.0) and global accuracy of 98.0 (95.9 to 99.0); metabolic acidosis: sensitivity of 75.8 (59.0 to 87.2), a specificity of 99.7 (98.2 to 99.9) and a global accuracy of 97.4 (95.1 to 98.6); metabolic alkalosis sensitivity of 72.2 (56.0 to 84.2), a specificity of 95.5 (92.5 to 97.3) and a global accuracy of 93.0 (88.8 to 95.3); the four complex acid-base disorders, respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, respiratory and metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis, the sensitivity, specificity and global accuracy was also high. For normal acid-base status the algorithm has PPV 87.1 (95% CI 76.6 to 93.3) %, and NPV 97.9 (95% CI 95.4 to 99.0) for a prevalence of 17.4 (95% CI 13.8 to 21.8). For the four-simple acid-base disorders and the four complex acid-base disorders the PPV and NPV were also statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The ABG-a showed very high agreement and diagnostic accuracy with experienced senior clinicians in the acid-base disorders in a clinical context. The method also provides refinement and deep complex analysis at the point-of-care that a clinician could have at the bedside on a day-to-day basis. The ABG-a method could also have the potential to reduce human errors by checking for imminent life-threatening situations, analysing the internal consistency of the results, the oxygenation and renal status of the patient.","Rodríguez-Villar, Sancho; Poza-Hernández, Paloma; Freigang, Sascha; Zubizarreta-Ormazabal, Idoia; Paz-Martín, Daniel; Holl, Etienne; Pérez-Pardo, Osvaldo Ceferino; Tovar-Doncel, María Sherezade; Wissa, Sonja Maria; Cimadevilla-Calvo, Bonifacio; Tejón-Pérez, Guillermo; Moreno-Fernández, Ismael; Escario-Méndez, Alejandro; Arévalo-Serrano, Juan; Valentín, Antonio; Do-Vale, Bruno Manuel; Fletcher, Helen Marie; Lorenzo-Fernández, Jesús Medardo",PLoS One,436,14

Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) are used in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. NMBA have also been used in COVID-19 patients who required mechanical ventilation (MV), but their benefit-to-risk ratio remains uncertain.METHODS. We investigated the effects associated with the use of NMBA in COVID-19 patients who required MV from January 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020 in 153 hospitals across 6 continents, comprising the COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium. Cox proportional hazards analysis was conducted to study the impact of NMBA on 28-day intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. Hospital/ICU lengths of stay were appraised. We performed a propensity score (PS) matching analysis to control confounding factors.RESULTS. 1227 patients were eligible for analysis, among those 598 (48.7%) received NMBA for 2 days or longer, with a median time from ICU admission to commencement of NMBA therapy of 0 day (IQR 0-1 days). The median duration of NMBA therapy was 2 days (N=789, IQR 1-5). In comparison with standard of care, treatment with NMBA was more frequent in obese (31% vs. 39%, P = 0.03) and diabetic patients (2% vs. 8%, P &lt;0.01) and less frequent in patients with hypertension (52% vs. 46%, P =0.04) or cardiac diseases (21% vs. 14%, P =0.003). Upon commencement of MV, patients who underwent NMBA therapy vs those who did not presented a PaO2/FiO2 of 136.1±69.2 vs. 162.7 ±125.8 (p&lt;0.01), required more often ECMO (10% vs 5.2%, p &lt;0.01) and prone position (25.1% vs 6.2%, p &lt;0.01). Unadjusted 28-day all-cause mortality was similar (58.2% vs. 62.4%, P =0.134) between patients without or with NMBA therapy, respectively, but length of MV (3 days [2-5] vs. 6 [3-12] P &lt;0.01) and ICU stay (8 days [4-14] vs. 13 [7-19] P &lt;0.01) were prolonged. After PS matching, NMBA therapy was strongly associated with 28-day ICU mortality (adjusted HR 3.18, 95% CI 2.65-3.81, P &lt;0.01). CONCLUSION. Use of NMBA in COVID-19 patients requiring MV is associated with increased 28-day mortality, delayed discontinuation of MV and prolonged ICU stay.","Li Bassi, G.; Gibbons, K.; Suen, J.; Dalton, H.

In this work, we demonstrate the interest of rGO-FET for the sensing of human papillomavirus (HPV), one of the most common sexually transmitted viruses and a necessary factor for cervical carcinogenesis. The highly sensitive and selective detection of the HPV-16 E7 protein relies on the attractive semiconducting characteristics of pyrene-modified rGO functionalized with RNA aptamer Sc5-c3. The aptamer-functionalized rGO-FET allows for monitoring the aptamer-HPV-16 E7 protein binding in real time with a detection limit of about 100 pg mL-1 (1.75 nM) for HPV-16 E7 from five blank noise signals (95% confidence level).

This review aims to consolidate the extensive biological minutiae of SARS-CoV-2 which requires decipherment. Having one of the largest RNA viral genomes, the single strand contains the genes ORF1ab, S, E, M, N and ten open reading frames. Highlighting unique features such as stem-loop formation, slippery frameshifting sequences and ribosomal mimicry, SARS-CoV-2 represents a formidable cellular invader. Hijacking the hosts translational engine, it produces two polyprotein repositories (pp1a and pp1ab), armed with self-cleavage capacity for production of sixteen non-structural proteins.

METHODS: Participants within the Pain Registry for Epidemiological, Clinical, and Interventional Studies and Innovation were eligible if they provided encounter data in the 3 months immediately before and after the national emergency proclamation date (NEPD). RESULTS: The mean age of the 528 study participants was 53.9 years and 74.1% were women. Utilization of exercise therapy, massage therapy, and spinal manipulation decreased during the pandemic. Increasing age was associated with decreased utilization of all nonpharmacological treatments except exercise therapy, and with increased opioid use during the pandemic. African American participants reported decreased utilization of yoga and spinal manipulation during the pandemic. Overall, mean change scores for pain intensity and disability before and after the NEPD were not significant. However, African American participants consistently reported worse pain intensity and disability outcomes during the pandemic. Marginally worse outcomes were observed less consistently for pain intensity with increasing age and for disability among women. DISCUSSION: Social distancing during the pandemic impacted the uptake of recommended nonpharmacological treatments for chronic low back pain that require visiting community-based facilities or interacting closely with providers. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic threatens to exacerbate the impact of chronic low back pain, particularly among African American patients and the older population, by impeding access to guideline-informed noninvasive treatments.","Licciardone, John C",J Am Board Fam Med,436,16

CDC, multiple other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and other partners are implementing aggressive measures to slow transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States (4,5). These measures require the identification of cases and their contacts in the United States and the appropriate assessment and care of travelers arriving from mainland China to the United States. These measures are being implemented in anticipation of additional 2019-nCoV cases in the United States. Although these measures might not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general public to be ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness occurs; and 3) better characterize 2019-nCoV infection to guide public health recommendations and the development of medical countermeasures including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.

Several improvements have been made, including discovery of the clinical efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) in patients with COVID-19, but effective treatment protocols remain elusive. In the search for novel treatment options, many scientists have used the in-silico approach to identify compounds that could interfere with the key molecules involved in entrance, replication or dissemination of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. However, most of the identified molecules are not available as pharmacological agents at present, and assessment of their safety and efficacy could take many months. This review took a different approach based on the proposed pharmacodynamic model of CQ in COVID-19. The main mechanism of action responsible for the favourable outcome of patients with COVID-19 treated with CQ seems to be related to a pH-modulation-mediated effect on endolysosomal trafficking, a characteristic of chemical compounds often called 'lysosomotropic agents' because of the physico-chemical properties that enable them to diffuse passively through the endosomal membrane and undergo protonation-based trapping in the lumen of the acidic vesicles. This review discusses lysosomotropic and lysosome targeting drugs that are already in clinical use and are characterized by good safety profiles, low cost and wide availability. Some of these drugs -particularly azithromycin and other macrolides, indomethacin and some other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and fluoxetine - could provide additional therapeutic benefits in addition to the potential antiviral effect that is still to be confirmed by well-controlled clinical trials. As some of these drugs have probably been used empirically in the treatment of COVID-19, it is hoped that colleagues worldwide will publish patient data to enable evaluation of the potential efficacy of these agents in the clinical context, and rapid implementation in therapeutic protocols if they are shown to have a beneficial effect on clinical outcome.","Homolak, J; Kodvanj, I",Int J Antimicrob Agents,436,1

The newly developed C-MAC Video Stylet promises to combine the advantages of rigid stylets and flexible optical scopes. We therefore evaluated the feasibility of awake orotracheal intubations with this device. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, three anesthesiologists experienced in advanced airway management performed each 12 awake oral intubations with this device on adult patients with known or predicted intubation difficulties. The primary outcome was overall intubation success. Secondary outcomes were total attempts, successful time, first post-operative day sequelae, and subjective intubation difficulty rated on a visual analogue scale (1, very easy; 10, extremely difficult). RESULTS: Ten (28%) patients were female, aged 64 +/-13 years, with BMI 26 +/- 5 kg.m- 1. ASA status (II/III/IV) was 8 (22%) /, 23 (64%) / 5 (14%). Indications for awake oral intubation were: oropharyngeal tumor 20 (56%), cervical-spine fracture 8 (22%), previously known difficult airway 4 (11%), spinal canal stenosis 3 (8%), and bilateral peritonsillar abscess 1 (3%). Overall 97% were successfully intubated in 45 s (31-88). First-attempt success rate was 80% in 37 s (29-54); 92% of patients would choose the same procedure again. On the first post-operative day, 11 (31%) patients complained of sore throat; 5 (14%) had minor injuries. Ease of intubation was rated as median VAS (IQR) 3 (1-7). CONCLUSIONS: The new C-MAC Video Stylet has the potential to serve as a suitable device for visualized oral awake intubation in difficult airway situations.","Nabecker, Sabine; Ottenhausen, Thora; Theiler, Lorenz; Braun, Matthias; Greif, Robert; Riva, Thomas",Minerva anestesiol,436,11

Herein, we investigated the infection and host response of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and macrophages (MDMs) infected by SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrated that moDCs and MDMs were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and protein expression but did not support productive virus replication. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 launched an attenuated interferon response in both cell types. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 triggered significant pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression in MDMs but not in moDCs. Further investigations suggested that this attenuated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in moDCs was associated with viral antagonism of STAT1 phosphorylation.

This article presents a team-based integration model that embraces intra-disciplinary collaboration in shared clinical care, professional development, and administrative processes to address this surge in demand for surgical care. Implementing this model will require communicating the rationale for and benefits of shared care, while shifting patient trust to a team of providers. For the individual surgeon, advantages of clinical integration through shared care include decreased burnout and professional isolation, and more efficient transitions into and out of practice. Advantages to the system include greater surgeon availability, streamlined disease site wait lists, and promotion of system efficiency through a centralized distribution of clinical resources. We present a framework to stimulate national dialogue around shared care that will ultimately help overcome system bottlenecks for surgical patients and provide support for health professionals.","Reid, Morgann; Lee, Alex; Urbach, David R; Kuziemsky, Craig; Hameed, Morad; Moloo, Husein; Balaa, Fady",Healthc Manage Forum,436,1

Up till now, there has been no clinical data with regards to COVID-19 from Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H). The aim was to report on the first cohort of patients from B&H and to analyze factors that influence COVID-19 patient's length of hospitalization (LOH). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Tuzla University Clinical Center (UKC), B&H. It involved 25 COVID-19 positive patients that needed hospitalisation between March 28th and April 27th 2020. The LOH was measured from the time of admission to discharge. Factors analyzed induced age, BMI, presence of known comorbidities, serum creatinine and O2 saturation upon admission. RESULTS: The mean age was 52.92 ± 19.15 years and BMI 28.80 ± 4.22. LOH for patients with BMI < 25 was 9 ± SE2.646 days (CI 95% 3.814-14.816) vs 14.182 ± SE .937 (CI 95% 12.346-16.018 p < 0.05; HR 5.148 CI95% 1.217 to 21.772 p = 0.026) for &#8805;25 BMI.

We analyzed the structure of the disease dynamics and observed three regimes in all probability density functions, which correspond to quick mild, quick extremely severe and sustained severe dynamical evolutions, respectively. Furthermore, we investigated the mathematical rate functions of the densities. The results indicate that the so called large-deviation property holds for the SIR model.

The pediatric neurosurgery practice differs from that of adults in that it treats children in various stages of physical and psychological development and contemplates diseases that do not exist in other areas. The aim of this study was to identify the level of knowledge and readiness of the healthcare providers, as well as to evaluate new preventive practices that have been introduced, psychological concerns, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric neurosurgical units in Brazil. METHODS: Pediatric neurosurgeons were given an online questionnaire developed by the Brazilian Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their clinical practice. RESULTS: Of a cohort of 110 active members of the Brazilian Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery, 76 completed the survey (69%). Ninety-six percent were aware of the correct use of and indication for the types of personal protective equipment in clinical and surgical practices, but only 73.7% of them had unrestricted access to this equipment. Ninety-eight percent of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the pandemic had affected their pediatric neurosurgical practice. The COVID-19 pandemic interfered with outpatient care in 88% of the centers, it affected neurosurgical activity in 90.7%, and it led to the cancellation of elective neurosurgical procedures in 57.3%. Concerning the impact of COVID-19 on surgical activity, 9.2% of the centers had less than 25% of the clinical practice affected, 46.1% had 26%-50% of their activity reduced, 35.5% had a 51%-75% reduction, and 9.2% had more than 75% of their surgical work cancelled or postponed. Sixty-three percent affirmed that patients had been tested for COVID-19 before surgery. Regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of those interviewed, 3.9% reported fear and anxiety with panic episodes, 7.9% had worsening of previous anxiety symptoms, 60.5% reported occasional fear, 10.5% had sadness and some depressive symptoms, and 2.6% reported depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to healthcare services worldwide, including neurosurgical units. Medical workers, pediatric neurosurgeons included, should be aware of safety measures and follow the recommendations of local healthcare organizations, preventing and controlling the disease. Attention should be given to the psychological burden of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers, which carries a high risk of anxiety and depression.","Ballestero, Matheus Fernando Manzolli; Furlanetti, Luciano; de Oliveira, Ricardo Santos",Neurosurg Focus,436,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data and CT images of 80 cases of NCP were collected. The clinical manifestations and laboratory test results of the patients were analysed. The lesions in each lung segment of the patient's chest CT images were characterised. Lesions were scored according to length and diffusivity. RESULTS: The main clinical manifestations were fever, dry cough, fatigue, a little white sputum, or diarrhoea. A total of 1,702 scored lesions were found in the first chest CT images of 80 patients. The lesions were located mainly in the subpleural area of the lungs (92.4%). Most of the lesions were ground-glass opacity, and subsequent fusions could increase in range and spread mainly in the subpleural area. Pulmonary consolidation accounted for 44.1% of all of the lesions. Of the 80 cases, 76 patients (95%) had bilateral lung disease, four (5%) patients had unilateral lung disease, and eight (10%) patients had cord shadow. CONCLUSION: The chest CT of NCP patients is characterised by the onset of bilateral ground-glass lesions located in the subpleural area of the lung, and progressive lesions that result in consolidation with no migratory lesions. Pleural effusions and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are rare. As patients can have inflammatory changes in the lungs alongside a negative early nucleic acid test, chest CT, in combination with epidemiological and laboratory tests, is a useful examination to evaluate the disease and curative effect.","Zhao, X; Liu, B; Yu, Y; Wang, X; Du, Y; Gu, J; Wu, X",Clin Radiol,436,21

In this study, we tested 1,013 bats belonging to 36 species from Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion Island and Seychelles, based on molecular screening and partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. In total, 88 bats (8.7%) tested positive for coronaviruses, with higher prevalence in Mozambican bats (20.5% ± 4.9%) as compared to those sampled on islands (4.5% ± 1.5%). Phylogenetic analyses revealed a large diversity of &#945;- and ß-CoVs and a strong signal of co-evolution between CoVs and their bat host species, with limited evidence for host-switching, except for bat species sharing day roost sites.

The aim was to identify the key domains that should be considered when developing pandemic preparedness plans for surgical services. METHODS: A scoping search was conducted to identify published articles relating to management of surgical patients during pandemics. Key informant interviews were conducted with surgeons and anaesthetists with direct experience of working during infectious disease outbreaks, in order to identify key challenges and solutions to delivering effective surgical services during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Thirteen articles were identified from the scoping search, and surgeons and anaesthetists representing 11 territories were interviewed. To mount an effective response to COVID-19, a pandemic response plan for surgical services should be developed in advance. Key domains that should be included are: provision of staff training (such as patient transfers, donning and doffing personal protection equipment, recognizing and managing COVID-19 infection); support for the overall hospital response to COVID-19 (reduction in non-urgent activities such as clinics, endoscopy, non-urgent elective surgery); establishment of a team-based approach for running emergency services; and recognition and management of COVID-19 infection in patients treated as an emergency and those who have had surgery. A backlog of procedures after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is inevitable, and hospitals should plan how to address this effectively to ensure that patients having elective treatment have the best possible outcomes.

Could the seminal fluid represent a way of sexual transmission for the virus? Why do men appear to be more susceptible than women? Several studies have been carried out to ascertain the presence of SARS−CoV−2 in the seminal fluid, with contrasting results;the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in the testes and in the male genital tract led to speculation about the possible presence of the virus in the seminal fluid However, it was found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2, used by the virus to enter host cells, are expressed differently in certain testicle cells (stem germ cells, Leydig and Sertoli cells), yet the testicle cells in which ACE2 and TMPRSS2 molecules are simultaneously expressed are rare This fact would suggest that the virus is not able to enter testicular cells, that it is not present in the seminal fluid and that it cannot infect male germ cells However, the direct influence of SARS-CoV-2 on the testes is still to be evaluated, and recent results are very controversial SARS-CoV-2 could enter the testicle using alternative paths and lead to alterations in testicular functionality Another plausible consideration is that the COVID-19 disease could also indirectly cause alterations to testicular activity, since the fever and the cytokinic storm generated by the immune system can lead to damage of the testicular activity, consequently compromising male fertility Although the literature provides controversial evidence, the purpose of this review is to lend a general overview about the state of the art Despite the lack of studies, it would represent a starting point for further investigation about the effect of this coronavirus on male fertility","Navarra, A.; Albani, E.; Castellano, S.; Arruzzolo, L.; Levi-Setti, P.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional research. METHODS: Data were taken from the Hamburg survey of homeless individuals (n = 151). HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D tool. More precisely, the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire was used to quantify problems in five health dimensions (i.e. mobility, self-care, usually activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), and its visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) was used to record the according self-rated health status. Explanatory variables include sex, age, education, marital status, country of origin, health insurance, and chronic alcohol consumption. RESULTS: With regard to HRQoL, most frequently, problems were reported as pain/discomfort (47.3%), followed by anxiety/depression (32.4%), mobility (29.7%), usual activities (20.7%) and self-care (4.6%). The mean EQ-VAS score was 75.34 (SD 22.23; range 1-100), and the mean EQ-5D-5L index was 0.84 (SD 0.23; range 0.32-1). Regressions showed increasing problems in mobility and self-care with higher age, whereas EQ-VAS was positively associated with younger age.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional research. METHODS: Data were taken from the Hamburg survey of homeless individuals (n = 151). HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D tool. More precisely, the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire was used to quantify problems in five health dimensions (i.e. mobility, self-care, usually activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), and its visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) was used to record the according self-rated health status. Explanatory variables include sex, age, education, marital status, country of origin, health insurance, and chronic alcohol consumption. RESULTS: With regard to HRQoL, most frequently, problems were reported as pain/discomfort (47.3%), followed by anxiety/depression (32.4%), mobility (29.7%), usual activities (20.7%) and self-care (4.6%). The mean EQ-VAS score was 75.34 (SD 22.23; range 1-100), and the mean EQ-5D-5L index was 0.84 (SD 0.23; range 0.32-1). Regressions showed increasing problems in mobility and self-care with higher age, whereas EQ-VAS was positively associated with younger age. Furthermore, EQ-5D-5L index was positively associated with younger age and higher education. Summarized, among this cohort, a higher age is associated with a lower HRQoL. CONCLUSION: Remarkably high EQ-VAS values and rather few problems in the five dimensions investigated here were reported among the homeless individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic particularly compared with the general population.

The aim of the current research is to test how transactional, transformational, and level 5 leadership styles influence the relationship between communication satisfaction and job satisfaction in CMC environments. The sample included 103 participants from Colombian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the tertiary sector. Cronbach's alpha coefficient, SPSS was used to determine the relationships between variables and test the moderating effects. Results show that 65.4% of organisational communication is performed via the Internet. Findings also demonstrate that level 5 leadership is the only style that influences the relationship. Results also indicate that the influence of level 5 leadership increases the relationship between communication satisfaction and job satisfaction. Implications are particularly relevant during the current global COVID19 pandemic when people have been required to move to a virtual work environment. In this scenario, the findings are valuable for scholars and managers as contributions for literature, research, evaluation, decision-making, and policy creation that help to understand and improve communication satisfaction, job satisfaction, and leadership practices in CMC environments. Outcomes offer new insights in the literature about leadership styles on SMEs in CMC environments.

Extra attention was paid to hygiene and infection prevention: the types of personal protective equipment and the protocols and procedures were adjusted by many oral healthcare providers. The confirmed prevalence of oral healthcare providers with COVID-19 in this study was 1.6%. However, testing was not available to all respondents with complaints during this initial period. Over half of the respondents estimated that even with additional measures there is an increased risk of infection to oral healthcare providers during their work.

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LAC DPH) set out to understand the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare facilities and HCWs by tracking and analyzing data from case-patient interviews of HCWs. As of May 31st, over three months into the pandemic, nearly 5,500 positive HCWs were reported to LAC DPH, representing 9.6% of all cases. Cases reported working in 27 different setting types, including outpatient medical offices, correctional facilities, emergency medical services, etc., with the highest proportion from long-term care facilities (46.6%) and hospitals (27.7%). Case-patients included both clinical and non-clinical roles, with nearly half (49.4%) of positive HCWs being nurses. Over two-thirds of HCWs (68.6%) worked at some point during their infectious period and nearly half (47.9%) reported a known exposure to a positive patient and/or co-worker within their facility. Overall, compared to all LAC cases, HCWs reported lower rates of hospitalization (5.3% vs. 12.2%) and death (0.7% vs. 4.3%) from COVID-19. There are many factors that increase HCWs risk of infection, including high risk work environment, limited supply of personal protective equipment, and even pressure to help and work during a pandemic. In response to these data, LAC DPH created resources and provided guidance for healthcare facilities to best protect their patients and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hartmann, Stacy; Rubin, Zachary; Sato, Heidi; OYong, Kelsey; Terashita, Dawn; Balter, Sharon",Clin. infect. dis,436,1

Readily available, alcohol is often one of the drugs of choice for adolescents. Whereas in the past 30 years, the overall consumption of alcohol is down, the data in the past 10 years have shown more girls are binge drinking and meeting criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD). The alarm of early alcohol use is the association with problems with the substances later in life. Historically, men and male adolescents consumed more alcohol than females. Recent studies indicate girls' alcohol use surpasses boys, whereas women now are developing AUD at the same rate as men. The consequences of early use can result in women's increased risk for multiple cancers, having a more severe form of AUD with less alcohol consumption as well as premature death. To further exacerbate this growing concern, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created a perfect storm for increased use of alcohol to cope with the stress of living in an uncertain world. Normal daily activities have been halted with the uncertainty of school closures, zoom classroom sessions, and living in mandated social isolation. All nurses need to be screening for how families under their care have been managing stress. The time is opportune to educate and support parents in engaging their children in conversations around substance use. Parents can be supported to increase awareness of their own coping mechanisms and strengthen positive coping. Adolescents need support to strengthen interpersonal skills as well as make informed decisions concerning when and how they engage in alcohol consumption. This article will illuminate the growing need for all healthcare providers to assess and guide adolescents' coping skills during COVID with a focus on mental health, high-risk behavior, and alcohol use.","Smith, Tedra S; Bryant, Pamela Harris; Fogger, Susanne Astrab",J Addict Nurs,436,22

The photocatalytic activities of both composites were then investigated through degradation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in aqueous solutions under visible light irradiation. It was found that CuTEPyP/TNTAs could eliminate 95% 4-NP within 4 h, which was considerably higher than the yield obtained with CuTEPyP/TNTs (56%) under the same conditions. Compared to CuTEPyP/TNTs, the improved photocatalytic activity of CuTEPyP/TNTAs can be ascribed to increased light absorption, high separation rate of photo-generated charge pairs, and efficient charge transfer. A plausible photocatalytic degradation mechanism involving hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radical anions and singlet oxygen species was also proposed. This work presents an efficient paradigm for eliminating 4-NP under visible light irradiation.","Zhou, Xian-Tai; Liu, Xiao-Hui; Huang, Xing-Jiao; Ji, Hong-Bing",J Hazard Mater,436,16

Formalized education of nasal anatomy may improve provider testing technique and reduce false-negative test results. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of nasal anatomy education on medical providers' comfort level and knowledge base in performing accurate SARS-CoV-2 (COVID) testing. STUDY DESIGN: Pre-post survey. SETTINGS: Tertiary care academic hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 17 nurses performing COVID testing were enrolled. INTERVENTION: An educational session on COVID nasopharyngeal testing technique and nasal anatomy was presented by an otolaryngologist. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A pre-session survey assessed providers' prior nasal testing training and COVID testing challenges. Provider comfort level with COVID testing was surveyed pre-and post-session. A 6-question nasal anatomy test was administered pre- and post-session. RESULTS: 16 out of 17 nurses performed fewer than 10 COVID tests prior to the educational session (94%). Reported challenges with COVID testing included patient discomfort (79.6%), inability to pass the test swab (23.5%) and nasal bleeding (11.8%). The number of providers comfortable with independently performing COVID testing increased from pre- to post-session (5 and 14, p = 0.013). The average number of correct responses to the 6-question nasal anatomy test increased following the session (3.2 ± 1.2 to 5.1 ± 1.1, p = 0.003). Specifically, the number of providers able to localize the nasopharynx increased from 8 providers pre-session to 14 providers post-session (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Early implementation of nasal anatomy and nasopharyngeal swab technique education can help improve provider comfort and knowledge in performing accurate COVID testing.","Li, Lilun; Shim, Timothy; Zapanta, Philip E",Am J Otolaryngol,436,11

Although mental health problems account for about one-third of the world's disability among adults, these issues tend to be under-addressed and overlooked in society and are closely associated with deadly disease outbreaks. In large scale outbreaks, the mental health problems experienced are not limited to infected persons but also extend to involve frontline health workers and community members alike.

During the pandemic, financial strain was the main impediment to following KD. The pandemic increased socioeconomic insecurity and access to KD-related products, as well as increasing anxiety in 71% of PWE, impacting their KD treatment follow-up.

METHODS: Clinical information of 20 COVID-19 pneumonia patients with CKD history diagnosed between January 20th and March 1st, 2020 were collected in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. We listed the clinical baseline data, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) changes and processed a short period of follow-up of these 20 patients. RESULTS: Based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on admission, 6 patients were classified as stage 2 of CKD, 5 were as 3a, 2 were as 3b, 3 were as 4 and 4 were as 5, respectively. COVID-19 patients with CKD history were elder and hypertension was the most common comorbidity. Cough and fever accounted for more than 80% of the infectious cases. Lymphopenia, increased D-dimer and elevated infectious indications such as hypersensitive C response protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) were also common among these patients. Ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation were the major manifestations in CT scans. 4 patients died and 7 patients underwent acute kidney injury (AKI) during observation. Among 16 discharged patients, 12 were with stable renal function and 4 had deteriorating renal function compared with that of admission. CONCLUSION: Compared to general population infected with SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 patients with CKD history had a preference to develop to severity with higher fatality rate.","Xu, Chuou; Zhang, Tianjing; Zhu, Na; Han, Min",Int. urol. nephrol,436,30

The handling of any students activities lie in the collective processes of submitting the proposal, securing the budget, getting the approval, promoting and handling the event, collecting feedbacks, reporting and post-mortem discussion. The management of these activities has been a major concern with the involvement of over 100 student clubs that carry out more than 20 events per week that are vying for a budget. Acquiring the approval for the event proposal, tracking the running of the activities and reporting are some of the factors that created a backlog from the management aspect. These procedures require a physical approach. Therefore, an Interactive Student Activities Management System (iSAMS) was designed and developed through the Waterfall methodology as a one-stop centre to help the UiTMCM Student Affairs Division facilitate the management of the students’ activities. This web-based system is able to track, display and store all the activities information from the proposal application stage until the end which includes tracking of attendance, progress of the event, collecting feedback, reporting of completed activities, storing supporting documents and generating reports for administrative purposes. All of these are done and managed via a secure, online interface in the Student Affairs Division website without physical presence of the students and the administrators. Even though iSAMS is yet to be completely implemented, the study has great potential in the form of a holistic management of students’ co-curricular activities. Going by that, in the end it is hoped that there is going to be a more efficient management of students’ co-curricular activities. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

The transmission of any infection in a dental office can occur while coming in direct contact with body fluids of an infected patient, environmental surfaces or contaminated dental instruments, or from the infectious particles that have become airborne. Even though the main source of transmission are the patients showing symptoms of COVID-19, recently, asymptomatic patients and patients in their incubation period are reported to be also the carriers of SARS-CoV-2, thereby increasing the risk of spread to close contacts and health-care workers. Because any patient could be a potential asymptomatic COVID-19 carrier, it is advisable to perform tele-screening of all the patients reporting to the clinic. As the transmission of 2019-nCoV via droplets and aerosol is of grave concern, as despite all the precautions taken, it is almost impossible to reduce droplet and aerosol production to zero during dental procedures, hence it is wise that the dental health professionals should not be dependent on any single infection control strategy.","Sultan, Amina Singh Neetika Juneja Akanksha",Journal of the International Clinical Dental Research Organization.,436,19

the worldwide spread of an extremely contagious virus that threatens people’s lives and health The article aims at identifying the transformational resource of the EU supranational economic governance in response to a new severe shock Therefore, two tasks are set Within the first one, this paper presents an overview of the European economic landscape on the eve of the pandemic, taking into account the long-term trends that emerged after the Great Recession and the euro area debt crisis Four key features of the “new normal” are highlighted: slow economic growth, fragile labor markets, high levels of government debt and subdued inflation We study the economic effects of pandemic, or rather, the confinement measures introduced by national governments, on these particular areas Within the second task this paper evaluates the effectiveness of the key economic responses the EU policy-makers and institutions are taking to counter the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to strengthen the resilience of the EU economic system This approach is translated into the re forms of the EU economic governance under way now with a view of achieving a genuine European and Monetary Union The paper concludes that with the creation of the single market and the euro the EU has taken almost full advantage of the negative integration And now to promote growth and employment it has to untap the potential of the positive integration, which benefits are likely to spread unevenly across regions and social groups Экономика Евросоюза переживает третье крупное потрясение за последние 12 лет Сначала это был мировой финансовый кризис, затем -долговой кризис еврозоны, теперь -

Европейском семестре, выполняют предписания органов ЕС в области банковского надзора и надзора за финансовыми рынками Денежно-кредитная политика относится к сфере исключительной компетенции органов ЕС, прежде всего Европейского центрального банка (ЕЦБ) Принимаемые им решения являются обязательными для стран еврозоны В этой части разделения компетенций не происходит К системе макроэкономического управления ЕС также следует отнести общий бюджет объединения Цель данной статьи - выявить трансформационный ресурс системы наднационального экономического управления ЕС в ответ на вызов пандемии коронавируса Для ее достижения решаются две задачи В рамках первой сначала дается общая оценка того состояния, в котором экономика ЕС находилась перед началом пандемии, с учетом сформированных после глобальной рецессии и кризиса еврозоны длительных тенденций Автор выделяет четыре главных аспекта «новой нормальности»: замедленный экономический рост, неустойчивое состояние рынка труда, возросший государственный долг и близкую к дефляции ценовую динамику Далее рассматривается влияние пандемии, вернее, введенных для ее преодоления ограничительных мер, на каждую из этих сфер Вторая задача - определить возможности системы макроэкономического управления Евросоюза продуктивно реагировать на возникший шок и проявлять способность к институциональной трансформации Для этого обобщаются решения, принятые органами Евросоюза (Комиссией, Советом и ЕЦБ), и оценивается их эффективность Они, в свою очередь, сопоставляются с теми реформами макроэкономического управления, которые Евросоюз начал после кризиса еврозоны Речь идет о достраивании экономической опоры Экономического и валютного союза путем создания Фискального союза, Финансового союза и Объединения рынка капиталов Делается вывод, что возможности ЕС стимулировать экономический рост и содействовать занятости определяются исчерпанием ресурса негативной (устраняющей барьеры) интеграции и переходом к преимущественно позитивной интеграции, эффект которой может быть менее выраженным и распределяться более неравномерно, чем выгоды от создания Единого внутреннего рынка и единой валюты","Butorina, O.

Methods: Instructors were invited to complete a survey that requested perceptions on methods, perceived quality, and challenges regarding course delivery and assessment in their online classrooms. Results: Despite the fact that more than half of the participants (59%) had some training, the majority (63%) reported that they had no experience in conducting online classrooms. Furthermore, more than 50% of the participants described the quality of the course delivery and assessment as the same or inferior to traditional classrooms. Most participants reported having an issue with measuring student involvement or gaining class interaction. Regarding the course assessment, the vast majority of the participants reported concerns about integrity issues associated with assignments and exams. Implications for Practice and Conclusion: Since instructors reported intention to continue online instruction post-pandemic, industrial engineering programs can begin strengthening the online learning infrastructure and providing some training to the instructors to minimize the discrepancies between face-to-face and online instruction.","Ardiyanto, Ardiyanto Mulyadin Taufik Mutiara Santi Adinda Dharma I.

It does appear that certain factors may worsen the disease process in BAME members, but which ones are pertinent to prevention remain to be determined, until a vaccine is available. Thus, the onus should rest on risk prevention, education, and support for all. Some of the safety strategies that may be instituted to help guide those in the workplace include education, treating potential therapeutic targets and ensuring protection in the working environment. The consideration of a compensation scheme, for families of healthcare workers that have suffered because of COVID-19, would go some way to support the recovery process.","Morris, Nicholas H; Elneil, Sohier; Morris, David; Ellis, Peter; Arulkumaran, Sabaratnam",J.

To further reveal the pathologic associations between coronavirus and hypoxemia, we report the findings of 4 complete systematic autopsies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive individuals who died of multiple organ failure caused by severe hypoxemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS We examined the donated corpses of 4 deceased patients who had been diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. A complete post-mortem examination was carried out on each corpse, and multiple organs were macroscopically examined. RESULTS The 4 corpses were 2 males and 2 females, with an average age of 69 years. Bilateral lungs showed various degrees of atrophy and consolidation, with diffusely tough and solid texture in the sections. A thromboembolism was found in the main pulmonary artery extending into the atrium in 1 corpse, and significant atherosclerotic plaques tagged in the inner wall of the aortic arch were found in 2 corpses. Two corpses were found to have slightly atrophied bilateral renal parenchyma. Atrophic changes in the spleen were found in 2 corpses. Notably, there were significantly expanded alveolar septa and prominent fibroblastic proliferation. CONCLUSIONS The laboratory data of these corpses showed a progressive decrease in blood oxygen saturation, followed by refractory and irreversible hypoxemia. Clinical and laboratory information and autopsy and histologic presentations of multiple organs showed insufficient air exchange due to abnormalities in the respiratory system, and reduced erythropoiesis in bone marrow may play a role.","Zhang, Heng; Zhou, Jun; Chen, Rong; Ren, Yong; Cai, Jun; Zhao, Lei; Fei, Xiaochun; Liu, Zhenhua; Zhang, Yu; Yuan, Ling; Wang, Chaofu",Med Sci Monit,436,16

Help to Overcome Problems Effectively (Hope) is a self-management program for people with cancer, designed to provide support for distress, unmet needs, and poor psychological health. In light of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, digital delivery of the Hope Programme has become ever more vital for people with cancer. Previous pre-post studies of the digital Hope Programme have found reduced anxiety and depression and improved well-being for people with cancer. However, evaluation of this evidence has been limited by the lack of a control group in these previous studies. OBJECTIVE: We now present a protocol for a feasibility randomized controlled trial of the digital Hope Programme for people with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes will be recruitment, dropout, and adherence rates, and estimations of sample and effect size. To detect signals of efficacy, secondary outcomes will be participant mental health and well-being. METHODS: Participants will be recruited by Macmillan Cancer Support (MCS) through their social media networks. The study will employ a feasibility wait-list randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, with people with cancer being randomized to join the digital Hope Programme immediately (intervention group [IG]) or join a 6-week waiting list (wait-list control group [WLCG]) with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants will complete digital measures of depression, anxiety, mental well-being, and confidence in managing their own health. Online questionnaires will be administered preprogram and 6 weeks postprogram. RESULTS: All people who had requested access to the Hope Programme from MCS (N=61) will be invited to participate in the trial. Baseline data collection commenced in April 2020, and the Hope Programme began for the IG in May 2020 and for the WLCG in June 2020. Postprogram data collection was completed by the end of August 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study will provide data to inform the design of a future definitive trial. Wider-scale provision of the digital Hope Programme has potential to improve the lives of thousands of people with cancer and reduce the burden on health care providers during these unprecedented times.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to report the outcomes of the dialogue and discussions with more than 200 participants representing different civil society organizations (CSOs). METHODS: The dialogue was held in form of a webinar. After an initial address of the WHO DG, short presentations by the panelists, and live discussions between panelists, the WHO DG and WHO representatives took place. The audience was able to post questions in written. These written discussions were saved with participants' consent and summarized in this paper. RESULTS: The main themes that were brought up by the audience for discussion were: (a) opportunities and challenges in general; (b) ethics and artificial intelligence; (c) digital divide; (d) education. Proposed actions included the development of a roadmap based on the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Decision making by policy makers needs to be evidence-based and health informatics research should be used to support decisions surrounding digital health, and we further propose next steps in the collaboration between IMIA and WHO such as future engagement in the World Health Assembly.","Koch, Sabine; Hersh, William R; Bellazzi, Riccardo; Leong, Tze Yun; Yedaly, Moctar; Al-Shorbaji, Najeeb",Yearb. med. inform.

Anemia of CKD may also be due to erythropoietin (EPO) resistance, clinically associated with inflammation. IL-1 receptor antagonist knockout (RaKO) mice show arthritis and excessive inflammation. Inhibition of IL-1 was shown to be beneficial in many inflammatory conditions, but its role in CKD and anemia is unknown. Here, we report that enhanced inflammation in RaKO mice with CKD provoked both higher degrees of renal insufficiency and anemia in comparison to wild-type CKD, in association with a downregulation of renal hypoxia inducible factor-2 (HIF2) as well as decreased bone marrow EPO-receptor (EPOR) and transferrin receptor (TFR). In contrast, administration of P2D7KK, an anti-IL1b monoclonal antibody, to CKD mice results in a lower grade of systemic inflammation, better renal function and blunted anemia. The latter was associated with upregulation of renal HIF-2&#945;, bone marrow EPO-R and TFR. Altogether, this supports the key role of inflammation, and IL-1 particularly, in CKD progression and anemia. Novel treatments to reduce inflammation through this and other pathways, may improve renal function, attenuate the anemic state or increase the response to exogenous EPO.","Bandach, Inbar; Segev, Yael; Landau, Daniel",Sci Rep,436,26

METHODS: We identified enrollees in the national U.S. Veterans Affairs healthcare system who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 2/28/2020 and 9/30/2020 (n=55,952), with follow-up extending to 11/19/2020. We determined trends over time in incidence of the following outcomes that occurred within 30 days of testing positive: hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and death. RESULTS: Between February and July 2020, there were marked downward trends in the 30-day incidence of hospitalization (44.2% to 15.8%), ICU admission (20.3% to 5.3%), mechanical ventilation (12.7% to 2.2%), and death (12.5% to 4.4%), which subsequently plateaued between July and September 2020. These trends persisted after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, documented symptoms and laboratory tests, including among subgroups of patients hospitalized, admitted to the ICU or treated with mechanical ventilation. From February to September, there were decreases in the use of hydroxychloroquine (56.5% to 0%), azithromycin (48.3% to 16.6%) vasopressors (20.6% to 8.7%), and dialysis (11.6% to 3.8%) and increases in the use of dexamethasone (3.4% to 53.1%), other corticosteroids (4.9% to 29.0%) and remdesivir (1.7% to 45.4%) among hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of adverse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients decreased markedly between February and July, with subsequent stabilization from July to September. These trends were not explained by changes in measured baseline patient characteristics and may reflect changing treatment practices or viral pathogenicity.","Ioannou, George N; O039,; Hare, Ann M; Berry, Kristin; Fan, Vincent S; Crothers, Kristina; Eastment, McKenna C; Locke, Emily; Green, Pamela; Shah, Javeed A; Dominitz, Jason A",Clin. infect. dis,436,1

The region is characterized by a low contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) of 5.4%. Lack of awareness of contraceptive use, husband objection and religious barriers are attributed to low CPR in the region. This study assessed the effect of community-based interventions for promoting family planning (FP) use among pastoralist communities in Ethiopia. METHODS: The study design was a three-arm, parallel, clustered randomized controlled trial (CRT). The three study arms were: (1) male involvement in family planning (FP) education; (2) women's education on FP; and (3) control. A total of 33 clusters were randomized and allocated with a one-to-one ratio. Intervention components included (1) health education on FP to married women and men by faema leaders (a traditional community-based structure that serves as a social support group); (2) video-assisted message on FP; and (3) assisting the faema leader using health workers and health extension workers (HEWs). The intervention was given for a total of nine months. FP use and intentions were measured as outcome variables. In addition, a cluster-level summary considering a cluster effect analysis was performed. The result was presented with t.test, adjusted risks and its 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The proportion of FP use among the arms was 34% in the male involvement in FP education, 17.5% in women's education on FP and 4.3% in the control. There was a positive change in the proportion of FP use in the male involvement in FP education and women's education on FP arms with absolute risk (AR) of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.23,0.34) and 0.13 (95% CI,0.08,0.17), respectively, as compared to the control arm. Similarly, married women in the male involvement in FP education and women's education on FP arms had 3.4 (2.48, 4.91) and 2.1 (1.50, 2.95) higher intention to use FP, respectively, as compared with the control arm. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that in such male-dominated pastoralist communities with more considerable religious barriers, the community-based health education mainly targeting males appears to be a promising strategy for improving FP use and intention to use FP.

Individuals with correct understanding about the risks and severity of the disease are more likely to respond positively and practice recommended preventive measures. Objectives: To assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 transmission and preventive measures among residents of Nigeria. Methods: The study was cross-sectional and involved 469 participants from 1st July to 31st August 2020. A 36-item questionnaire with Cronbach alpha of 0.753 was adapted and administered through an online survey tool. A snowball sampling approach was employed whereby the questionnaire link was distributed through social media networks including WhatsApp©, Facebook© and Instagram©. Data was analysed using SPSS 23 and a statistical significance level of 0.05 was used. Bivariate and multivariate analysis were employed to determine factors affecting the knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19 transmission and prevention. Results: The mean age of participants was 39±11.29years. Majority (54%) of the participants heard about COVID-19 through mass and social media. The study found that 71.6% of the participants had good knowledge, just 31.3% had a good attitude while 84.9% of them had good practices towards COVID-19 in Nigeria. The high rates of the knowledge and practices were driven by income, age, education and marital status. Conclusions: Majority of the study participants showed correct knowledge and adhered to recommended practices towards COVID- 19.

Method: This survey-based study was conducted in 2020. Surveys were distributed electronically by e-mail to providers and patients. Participants: Surveys related to satisfaction levels with telemedicine were distributed to 73 primary care providers and 6,626 patients. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary measures of this study were satisfaction level with telemedicine in primary care. Results: Studies were completed by 23 primary care providers and 1,692 patients. Most patient participants were female (70.8%), white (89.7%), non-Hispanic or non-Latino (96.6%), and Massachusetts residents (96.9%). Variables that were found to be significantly associated with higher levels of satisfaction with telemedicine visits included: travel time saved >30 min (odds ratio [OR] 1.8), having an easy visit connection (OR = 3.2), use of Zoom© video visit over telephone only (OR = 2.8), and identifying as female (OR 1.8). Conclusions and Relevance: Patients and providers reported high levels of satisfaction with telemedicine visits in a primary care setting. Providers felt that telemedicine visits usually take the same amount or less time than in-person visits. Both providers and patients reported a desire to see telemedicine visits continued after the pandemic. Patients who saved more than 30 min of travel time found it easy to connect or those who were female were more likely to be satisfied with telemedicine visits, while those that had telephone visits were less likely to be satisfied than those that had Zoom© visits.","Vosburg, R Wesley; Robinson, Kortney A",Telemed. j. e. health,436,1

Specifically, the pandemic demonstrates the hollowness of the global health rhetoric of equity, the weaknesses of a health security-driven global health agenda, and the negative health impacts of power differentials not only globally, but also regionally and locally. This article analyses the effects of these inequities and calls on governments, multilateral agencies, universities, and NGOs to engage in true collaboration and partnership in this historic moment.

To counter thus, a number of approaches have been designed aiming to achieve a healthier and safer online news and media consumption. Automatic systems are able to support humans in detecting such content; yet, a major impediment to their broad adoption is that besides being accurate, the decisions of such systems need also to be interpretable in order to be trusted and widely adopted by users. Since misleading and propagandistic content influences readers through the use of a number of deception techniques, we propose to detect and to show the use of such techniques as a way to offer interpretability. In particular, we define qualitatively descriptive features and we analyze their suitability for detecting deception techniques. We further show that our interpretable features can be easily combined with pre-trained language models, yielding state-of-the-art results.","Yu, Seunghak; Martino, Giovanni Da San; Mohtarami, Mitra; Glass, James; Nakov, Preslav",,436,20

Questions/Purposes: To help strategize an effective return to elective orthopedic surgery, we aimed to quantify the volume of THA and TKA cases delayed across the USA and estimate the time required to care for these patients when non-urgent surgery resumes. Methods: Population-level data was used to estimate monthly THA and TKA procedural volume from 2011 to 2017. Using linear regression, we used this data to project monthly procedural volumes for 2020 to 2023. Nine different permutations were modeled to account for variations in case delay rates (50%, 75%, 100%) and in resumption of non-urgent procedure timing. Two recovery pathways using the highest volume month as a surrogate for maximum operative capacity, and a second using the highest month + 20% were used to simulate a theoretical expansion of current capacity. Results: The projected national volume of delayed cases was 155,293 (mid-March through April; 95% CI 142,004 to 168,580), 260,806 (through May; 95% CI 238,658 to 282,952), and 372,706 (through June; 95% CI 341,699 to 403,709). The best- and worst-case scenarios for delayed cases were 77,646 (95% CI 71,002 to 84,290) and 372,706 (95% CI 341,699 to 403,709), respectively. The projected catch-up time varied between 9 and nearly 35 months for the best- and worst-case scenarios. The addition of 20% increased productivity decreased this time to between 3.21 and 11.59 months. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a significant backlog of THA and TKA procedures. Surgeons, administrators, and policymakers should account for these modeled estimates of case volume delays and projected demands.","Wilson, Jacob M; Schwartz, Andrew M; Farley, Kevin X; Roberson, James R; Bradbury, Thomas L; Guild, George N",HSS J,436,16

Comparar las propiedades diagnósticas de cinco definiciones de caso sospechoso de COVID-19 utilizadas o propuestas en Chile durante los primeros ocho meses de la pandemia. Métodos. Se analizaron las propiedades diagnósticas (sensibilidad, especificidad, y valores predictivos positivo y negativo) de tres definiciones de caso sospechoso de COVID-19 utilizadas en Chile entre marzo y octubre del 2020, y dos propuestas de definición alternativas. La muestra fue de 2 019 personas con resultados conocidos a la prueba de la reacción en cadena de la polimerasa (PCR) para SARS-CoV-2. Para elaborar el criterio 5 se aplicó una regresión logística escalonada (stepwise) optimizando los valores de sensibilidad y especificidad. Se exploró la asociación de variables demográficas, síntomas y signos con la positividad a la PCR mediante regresión logística multifactorial. Se analizaron diferentes escenarios de positividad y se compararon las curvas ROC. Resultados. La presencia de anosmia (OR = 8,00; IC95%: 5,34–11,99) y fiebre (OR = 2,15; IC95%: 1,28–3,59) y el haber tenido contacto estrecho previo con una persona enferma de COVID-19 (OR = 2,89; IC95%: 2,16–3,87) se asociaron con un resultado positivo de la PCR. Según el análisis de las curvas ROC, el criterio 5 tuvo la mayor capacidad de discriminación, aunque sin diferencias significativas con los otros cuatro criterios. Conclusiones. El criterio 5 —basado en la anosmia, el contacto estrecho con personas enfermas de COVID-19 y la fiebre como elementos únicos suficientes— tuvo la mayor sensibilidad para identificar los casos sospechosos de COVID-19, aspecto fundamental para controlar la propagación de la pandemia.","Aubert, Josefina; Durán, Doris; Monsalves, María José; Rodríguez, María Francisca; Rotarou, Elena S.; Gajardo, Jean; Alfaro, Tania; Bertoglia, María Paz; Muñoz, Sergio; Cuadrado, Cristóbal",Rev. panam. salud pública,436,24

Starting from the hypothesis that the observed T$_c$ may be realized by successive heating upon a pre-formed LaH$_{10}$ phase, we examine plausible ternaries of lanthanum, hydrogen and other elements present in the diamond anvil cell: boron, nitrogen, carbon, platinum, gallium, gold. We find that only boron forms superhydride-like structures that can host high-Tc superconductivity, but the predicted Tc are incompatibe with the experimental reports. Our results indicate that, while the claims of hot superconductivity should be reconsidered, it is very likely that unkwown H-rich ternary or multinary phases containing lanthanum, boron and hydrogen may have formed under the reported experimental conditions, and that these may exhibit superconducting properties comparable, or even superior, to those of currently known hydrides.","Cataldo, Simone Di; Linden, Wolfgang von der; Boeri, Lilia",,436,30

However, with rising numbers of cases, multiple reports of cardiovascular manifestations have emerged. We present a case of COVID-19 infection complicated by myopericarditis and tamponade requiring drainage. CASE REPORT An 82-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities presented with five days of productive cough, fever with chills, and intermittent diarrhea. She tested positive for COVID-19. Index EKG revealed new diffuse T-wave inversions and a prolonged QT interval (>500 ms). Troponin was mildly elevated without any anginal symptoms. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were not initiated due to concerns about QT prolongation. The echocardiogram revealed preserved left ventricular (LV) function, a small global pericardial effusion, and apical hypokinesis. Serial echocardiograms revealed an enlarging circumferential pericardial effusion with pacemaker wire reported as 'piercing' the right ventricular (RV) apex alongside early diastolic collapse of the right ventricle, suggesting echocardiographic tamponade. Chest CT revealed extension of the RV pacemaker lead into the pericardial fat. Interestingly, on comparison with a previous chest CT from 2019, similar lead positions were confirmed. Pericardiocentesis was performed with removal of 400 cc exudate. CONCLUSIONS Acute myopericarditis and pericardial effusion can occur in COVID-19 infection, even in the absence of severe pulmonary disease. This case highlights the importance of awareness of rare cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 in the form of acute myopericarditis and cardiac tamponade and their early diagnosis and management.","Purohit, Richa; Kanwal, Arjun; Pandit, Anil; Patel, Bhavin M; Meininger, Glenn Robert; Brown, Jeffrey Jay; Kaliyadan, Antony George; Saini, Aditya",Am J Case Rep,436,33

METHODS: An analysis of electronic health records for a large (68,466-case), international COVID-19 cohort, in 5-year age strata, revealed age-dependent sex differences. In particular, we surveyed the effects of systemic hormone administration in women. The primary outcome for estradiol therapy was death. Odds ratios (ORs) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed for 37,086 COVID-19 women in two age groups: pre- (15-49 years) and peri-/post-menopausal (> 50 years). RESULTS: The incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is higher in women than men (by about + 15%) and, in contrast, the fatality rate is higher in men (about + 50%). Interestingly, the relationships between these quantities are linked to age: pre-adolescent girls and boys had the same risk of infection and fatality rate, while adult premenopausal women had a significantly higher risk of infection than men in the same 5-year age stratum (about 16,000 vs. 12,000 cases). This ratio changed again in peri- and postmenopausal women, with infection susceptibility converging with men. While fatality rates increased continuously with age for both sexes, at 50 years, there was a steeper increase for men. Thus far, these types of intricacies have been largely neglected. Because the hormone 17ß-estradiol influences expression of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, which plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry, propensity score matching was performed for the women's sub-cohort, comparing users vs. non-users of estradiol. This retrospective study of hormone therapy in female COVID-19 patients shows that the fatality risk for women > 50 years receiving estradiol therapy (user group) is reduced by more than 50%; the OR was 0.33, 95% CI [0.18, 0.62] and the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.29, 95% CI [0.11,0.76]. For younger, pre-menopausal women (15-49 years), the risk of COVID-19 fatality is the same irrespective of estradiol treatment, probably because of higher endogenous estradiol levels. CONCLUSIONS: As of this writing, still no effective drug treatment is available for COVID-19; since estradiol shows such a strong improvement regarding fatality in COVID-19, we suggest prospective studies on the potentially more broadly protective roles of this naturally occurring hormone.","Seeland, Ute; Coluzzi, Flaminia; Simmaco, Maurizio; Mura, Cameron; Bourne, Philip E; Heiland, Max; Preissner, Robert; Preissner, Saskia",BMC Med,436,24

Mortality rates of older people with dementia in residential long-term care homes have been exponentially higher than the general public. Morbidity rates are also higher in these homes with the effects of government-imposed COVID-19 public health directives (e.g., strict social distancing), which have led most residential long-term care homes to adopt strict 'no visitor' and lockdown policies out of concern for their residents' physical safety. This tragic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic highlights profound stigma-related inequities. Societal assumptions that people living with dementia have no purpose or meaning and perpetuate a deep pernicious fear of, and disregard for, persons with dementia. This has enabled discriminatory practices such as segregation and confinement to residential long-term care settings that are sorely understaffed and lack a supportive, relational, and enriching environment. With a sense of moral urgency to address this crisis, we forged alliances across the globe to form Reimagining Dementia: A Creative Coalition for Justice. We are committed to shifting the culture of dementia care from centralized control, safety, isolation, and punitive interventions to a culture of inclusion, creativity, justice, and respect.

A key conclusion of our study is that the problem of bias discovery and quantification in visual datasets is still open and there is room for improvement in terms of both methods and the range of biases that can be addressed; moreover, there is no such thing as a bias-free dataset, so scientists and practitioners must become aware of the biases in their datasets and make them explicit.

However, nearly all high-resolution results are based on data acquired on state-of-the-art microscopes where their availability is restricted to a number of centers across the globe with the studies on infectious viruses being further regulated or forbidden. One potential remedy is to employ multipurpose microscopes. Here, we investigated the capability of 200 kV multipurpose microscopes equipped with a direct electron camera in determining the structures of infectious particles. We used 30 nm particles of the grouper nerve necrosis virus as a test sample and obtained the cryo-EM structure with a resolution as high as â¼2.7 Å from a setting that used electron counting. For comparison, we tested a high-end cryo-EM (Talos Arctica) using a similar virus (Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus) to obtain virtually the same resolution. Those results revealed that the resolution is ultimately limited by the depth of field. Our work updates the density maps of these viruses at the sub-3Å level to allow for building accurate atomic models from de novo to provide structural insights into the assembly of the capsids. Importantly, this study demonstrated that multipurpose TEMs are capable of the high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination of infectious particles and is thus germane to the research on pandemics.","Wang, Chun-Hsiung; Chen, Dong-Hua; Huang, Shih-Hsin; Wu, Yi-Min; Chen, Yi-Yun; Hwu, Yeukuang; Bushnell, David; Kornberg, Roger; Chang, Wei-Hau",Int. j. mol. sci.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, active, controlled noninferiority trial in an urban setting, including patients from a small community hospital and a large, tertiary care hospital. Patients who underwent minimally invasive appendectomy or cholecystectomy by a group of surgeons who cover emergency general surgery at these 2 hospitals were included. Patients undergoing elective and nonelective procedures were included. Interventions: Patients were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to video-based virtual visit or in-person visit. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome is the percentage of patients with 30-day hospital encounter, and we hypothesized that there would not be a significant increase in the 30-day hospital encounter proportion for patients who receive video-based virtual postdischarge care compared with patients who receive standard (in-person) care. Hospital encounter includes emergency department visit, observation, or inpatient admission. Results: A total of 1645 patients were screened; 289 patients were randomized to the virtual group and 143 to the in-person group. Fifty-three patients crossed over to the in-person follow-up group. The percentage of patients who had a hospital encounter was noninferior for virtual visits (12.8% vs 13.3% for in-person, &#916; 0.5% with 1-sided 95% CI, -&#8734; to 5.2%). The amount of time patients spent with the clinician (mean of 8.4 minutes virtual vs 7.8 minutes in-person; P = .30) was not different, but the median overall postoperative visit time was 27.5 minutes shorter (95% CI, -33.5 to -24.0). Conclusions and Relevance: Postdischarge video-based virtual visits did not increase hospital encounter proportions and provided shorter overall time commitment but equal time with the surgical team member. This information will help surgeons and patients feel more confident in using video-based virtual visits.

Therefore, this study aimed at assessing depression, anxiety, stress and identifying their associated factors among university students in Ethiopia during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We invited students to complete an online survey using Google forms comprising consent, socio-demographic characteristics, and the standard validated depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) questionnaire. After completion of the survey from June 30 to July 30, 2020, we exported the data into SPSS 22. Both descriptive and analytical statistics were computed. Associated factors were identified using binary logistic regression and variables with a p-value <0.05 were declared as statistically significant factors with the outcome variables. RESULTS: A total of 423 students completed the online survey. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in this study was 46.3%, 52%, and 28.6%, respectively. In the multivariable model, female sex, poor self-efficacy to prevent COVID-19, those who do not read any material about COVID-19 prevention, lack of access to reading materials about their profession, and lack of access to uninterrupted internet access were significantly associated with depression. Female sex, lower ages, students with non-health-related departments, those who do not think that COVID-19 is preventable, and those who do not read any materials about COVID-19 prevention were significantly associated with anxiety. Whereas, being female, students attending 1st and 2nd years, those who do not think that COVID-19 is preventable, presence of confirmed COVID-19 patient at the town they are living in, and lack of access to reading materials about their profession were significantly associated with stress. CONCLUSIONS: Depression, anxiety, and stress level among University students calls for addressing these problems by controlling the modifiable factors identified and promoting psychological wellbeing of students.","Simegn, Wudneh; Dagnew, Baye; Yeshaw, Yigizie; Yitayih, Sewbesew; Woldegerima, Birhanemeskel; Dagne, Henok",PLoS One,436,6

The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic witnessed marked increases in kindness and social connection, but as months passed social tensions re-emerged or grew anew. Thus local authorities faced persistent and evolving challenges. A cross-sectional survey (N = 2,924) examined perceptions of social cohesion while Britain was slowly emerging from its first national lockdown in June 2020 in six English local authorities that have prioritised investment in social cohesion over the last two years (including five 'integration areas') compared with three other areas that have not. We expected that social cohesion programmes would better equip people to tackle the various challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found a greater sense of social cohesion in the six local authorities (at the micro, meso and macro levels) than in other areas. This was manifested as higher levels of reported social activism, interpersonal trust and closer personal relationships, greater political trust and more positive attitudes towards immigrants. Findings are consistent with the proposition that investing in social cohesion underpins stronger and more connected and open communities, better able to cope with crisis situations.","Lalot, Fanny; Abrams, Dominic; Broadwood, Jo; Davies Hayon, Kaya; Platts-Dunn, Isobel",,436,10

Methods: To uncover more about the probable gastrointestinal transmission and its clinical manifestations, we reviewed all research publications with keywords including: “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “Coronavirus”, “outbreak”, “ARAS-CoV” in Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar as well as all news in social media about “novel COVID-19 pandemic”. Out of 40 recent publications, 10 articles were studied by 2 authors. Results: Although the SARS-CoV-2 tends to infect respiratory epithelial cells through the respiratory tracts, recent investigations detected the virus in the stool specimen, raising the question of the fecal-oral transmission route. Different studies showed that almost all gastrointestinal signs and symptoms were seen in elderly patients (more than 65 years old). including anorexia (40%), nonspecific abdominal pains (8%), diarrhea (10%) and nausea and Vomiting in about 8% of patients. Anorexia and generalized abdominal pain suffer many treated cases even 10-20 days after negative blood tests (like CRP, lymphopenia) and negative PCR of respiratory samples. The main reason for this prolonged anorexia and abdominal pain may be due to the long persistence of COVID-19 in the gastrointestinal tracts after primary treatment. Conclusions: Comparing to SARS, patients with COVID-19 showed less diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and/or abdominal discomfort before respiratory symptoms. Feces as a potential contagious source of Viral RNA can last even after viral clearance in the respiratory tract. We strongly recommend all cured patients of COVID-19 to disinfect and clean their toilets until 17-20 days after negative blood tests and solving their respiratory disorders. Gastrointestinal manifestations have seen in all men while no women referred with GI signs.","Miri, Seyyed Mohammad; Roozbeh, Fatemeh; Omranirad, Ali; Alavian, Seyed Moayed",Hepat. Mon.,436,26

We analysed information on the cases of infection to infer whether airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, had occurred between cabins. We infer from our analysis that most infections in passengers started on 28 January and were completed by 6 February, except in those who shared a cabin with another infected passenger. The distribution of the infected cabins was random, and no spatial cluster of the infected can be identified. We infer that the ship's central air-conditioning system for passenger's cabins did not play a role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, i.e. airborne transmission did not occur between cabins during the outbreak, suggesting that the sufficient ventilation was provided. We also infer that the ship's cabin drainage system did not play a role. Most transmission appears to have occurred in the public areas of the cruise ship, likely due to crowding and insufficient ventilation in some of these areas.","Xu, Pengcheng; Jia, Wei; Qian, Hua; Xiao, Shenglan; Miao, Te; Yen, Hui-Ling; Tan, Hongwei; Kang, Min; Cowling, Benjamin J; Li, Yuguo",Build Environ,436,6

Quantitative PCR was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Results of SCPS vs. NP samples testing were compared. Statistical analyses were performed. Viral load was significantly correlated (r = 0.72). The concordance probability was estimated at 73.3%. In symptomatic adults, SCPS performance was similar to that of NP swabs (Percent Agreement = 74.1%; p = 0.11). Thus, the salivary test based on pure oral saliva samples easily obtained by noninvasive techniques has a fair agreement with the nasopharyngeal one in asymptomatic, mild patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.","Carrouel, Florence; Valette, Martine; Perrier, Hervé; Bouscambert-Duchamp, Maude; Dussart, Claude; Tramini, Paul; Bourgeois, Denis",Viruses,436,1

In April-May 2020, we generated a digital, remote interactive tool to provide health and well-being resources and foster connectivity among community members through a text messaging platform. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to prospectively investigate the ability of a health system-based digital, remote, interactive tool to provide health and well-being resources to local community participants and to foster connectivity among them during the early phases of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed descriptive and nonparametric longitudinal statistical analyses to describe and compare the participants' mood ratings over time and thematic analysis of their responses to text messages to further assess mood. RESULTS: From among 393 individuals seeking care in an urban emergency department in an academic setting, engaged in a two-way text messaging platform, we recorded 287 mood ratings and 368 qualitative responses. We observed no difference in the initial mood rating by week of enrollment [Kruskal-Wallis chi-square H(5)=1.34; P=.93], and the average mood rating did not change for participants taken together [Friedman chi-square Q(3)=0.32; P=.96]. However, of participants providing mood ratings at baseline, mood improved significantly among participants who reported a low mood rating at baseline [n=25, 14.97%; Q(3)=20.68; P<.001] but remained stable among those who reported a high mood rating at baseline [n=142, 85.03%; Q(3)=2.84; P=.42]. Positive mood elaborations most frequently included words related to sentiments of thankfulness and gratitude, mostly for a sense of connection and communication; in contrast, negative mood elaborations most frequently included words related to anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the feasibility of engaging individuals in a digital community with an emergency department facilitation. Specifically, for those who opt to engage in a text messaging platform during COVID-19, it is feasible to assess and respond to mood-related queries with vetted health and well-being resources.","Ortiz, Robin; Southwick, Lauren; Schneider, Rachelle; Klinger, Elissa V; Pelullo, Arthur; Guntuku, Sharath Chandra; Merchant, Raina M; Agarwal, Anish K",JMIR Ment Health,436,26

Methods: We searched Cochrane library, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, CBM, Wanfang Data and CNKI from their inception to March 31, 2020. In addition, we searched related studies on COVID-19 published before March 31, 2020 through Google Scholar. We evaluated the risk of bias of included studies, and synthesized the results using a qualitative synthesis. Results: Six studies met our inclusion criteria. Five studies on SARS showed an overall risk of death of 7.2% to 20.0%. One study of SARS patients who used macrolides, quinolones or beta lactamases showed that the mean duration of hospital stay was 14.2, 13.8 and 16.2 days, respectively, and their average duration of fever was 14.3, 14.0 and 16.2 days, respectively. One cohort study on MERS indicated that macrolide therapy was not associated with a significant reduction in 90-day mortality (adjusted OR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.47-1.51, P=0.56) and improvement in MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted HR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.47-1.64, P=0.68). According to the findings of 33 studies, the proportion of antibiotics use ranged from 19.4% to 100.0% in children and 13.2% to 100.0% in adults, despite the lack of etiological evidence. The most commonly used antibiotics in adults were quinolones, cephalosporins and macrolides and in children meropenem and linezolid. Conclusions: The benefits of antibiotic agents for adults with SARS or MERS were questionable in the absence of bacterial coinfections. There is no evidence to support the use of antibiotic agents for children with COVID-19 in the absence of bacterial coinfection.","Wang, Jianjian; Tang, Yuyi; Ma, Yanfang; Zhou, Qi; Li, Weiguo; Baskota, Muna; Yang, Yinmei; Wang, Xingmei; Li, Qingyuan; Luo, Xufei; Fukuoka, Toshio; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Luo, Zhengxiu; Liu, Enmei; Chen, Yaolong",Ann.

This situation may lead to a strong incentive for people to buy a vaccine. Therefore, a relevant study to assess individuals' choices and the value of change in welfare from a COVID-19 vaccine is essential. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) value for a vaccine for COVID-19. We also identify the variables that influence individual vaccination decisions, which could be used in the design of vaccination promotion strategies. METHODS: We use the contingent valuation method in its double-bounded dichotomous choice format. The estimation coefficients are calculated according to the maximum likelihood method under the assumption of a probit distribution. The sample consisted of 531 individuals, mainly from middle- and high-income socioeconomic groups from Chile between enrolled between 10 July and 10 August 2020. RESULTS: The results show a high WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine, with a value up to US$232. Income and education levels and having family members with COVID-19 increased the likelihood of persons paying for a vaccine. There is also a greater fear as the pandemic progresses that people will get sick from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The high WTP value creates an opportunity for formulating public health policy. The results of this study suggest that governments can provide the vaccine free to low-income groups and allow those with higher incomes to acquire the vaccine through the private sector by paying. This will be useful especially for countries with economic difficulties.","Cerda, Arcadio A; García, Leidy Y",Appl Health Econ Health Policy,436,1

BACKGROUND: The demand for front-line nurses continues to grow during the COVID-19 pandemic, but their willingness varies significantly. Therefore, it is crucial to explore nurses' willingness to report for front-line work. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 1,310 nurses from six tertiary hospitals was conducted. The participants completed self-administered online questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 90.5% of nurses reported that they would like to voluntarily participate in front-line work. Those with previous training, higher self-efficacy scores, and lower perceived risk and self-worth scores were more likely to participate in front-line work, while nurses, who had 11-15 years of work experience and were worried about their family and the lack of family support, were less likely to be involved in front-line work. CONCLUSION: This study found that the vast majority of nurses were willing to participate in front-line work and affirmed the positive effects of previous infection prevention training, self-efficacy and self-worth.

The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate chest CT performances to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia with regard to RT-PCR as reference standard in a low incidence area. METHODS: A survey was sent to radiology department in 4 hospitals in an administrative French region of weak disease prevalence (3.4%). Study design was approved by the local institutional review board and recorded on the clinicaltrial.gov website (NCT04339686). Written informed consent was waived due to retrospective anonymized data collection. Patients who underwent a RT-PCR and a chest CT scan within 48 h for COVID-19 pneumonia suspicion were consecutively included. Diagnostic accuracy including the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of chest CT regarding RT-PCR as reference standard were calculated. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine patients had abnormal chest CT findings compatible with a COVID-19 pneumonia (26%, 129/487). Among the 358 negative chest CT findings, 3% (10/358) were RT-PCR positive.

Along their evolutionary history, they adapted to tolerate hypoxia, high salinity, low temperature and, in particular, to tolerate conditions of high hydrostatic pressure. To understand the limits of the capacity of lice to survive during host deep dives, we conducted a series of controlled experiments in the laboratory. We collected lice from elephant seals and submitted the different life stages to high pressure conditions. Lice were first exposed to one of four hydrostatic pressures: (a) 30 Kg/cm2; (b) 80 Kg/cm2; (c) 150 Kg/cm2, or (d) 200 Kg/cm2 They were then exposed a second time to higher or lower hydrostatic pressure conditions to test for the impact of the first experience, which could either be deleterious or trigger physiological adaption, allowing them a better tolerance to high pressure. We found that lice from elephant seals can tolerate hydrostatic pressures higher than 200 Kg/cm2 (close to 200 atm), equivalent to 2000 m depth. Adults exhibited lower recovery times than nymphs after immersion at high hydrostatic pressure. Our findings show that lice developed unique adaptations to endure extreme marine conditions.

Appropriate HF management extensively relies upon patient-reported symptoms. With the growing attention towards patient-centered care, our team recognized an invaluable opportunity to solicit patient-reported subjective experiences regarding telehealth. METHODS: In total, 127 patients with a known diagnosis of HF were contacted by phone for participation in an online questionnaire. The tool consisted of questions generated by the investigators and from prior validated patient-reported experience measures. The intention was to assess the quality of care in our HF clinic and to solicit feedback regarding telehealth. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients provided a response. Questions with the most favorable outcomes were in line with our predetermined themes of interpersonal matter, communication, and perceived quality of care. The worst performing questions exhibited a lack of satisfaction with and perceived quality of telehealth. Only 9% (n = 3) preferred follow-up via telehealth, 69% (n = 22) preferred in-person, and 22% (n = 7) were indifferent. CONCLUSIONS: Given the multitude of benefits of telehealth, especially appropriate social distancing, telehealth is quite likely here to stay. In sum, with the rapid change in care delivery, patients currently perceive the care delivered via telehealth to be of inferior quality. This lack of quality can be largely attributed to the lack of physical examination, depersonalization of healthcare, and likely, a lack of familiarity with the platform. We urge our colleagues to solicit similar feedback from their patients to improve their own telehealth efforts.","Raman, Karanvir S.; Vyselaar, John R.",Cardiol Res,436,1

We created three vulnerability indices to identify areas and people who require greater support while elucidating health inequities to inform emergency response in Kenya. Methods: Geospatial indicators were assembled to create three vulnerability indices; social (SVI), epidemiological (EVI) and a composite of the two (SEVI) resolved at 295 sub-counties in Kenya. SVI included nineteen indicators that affect the spread of disease; socio-economic inequities, access to services and population dynamics while EVI comprised five indicators describing comorbidities associated with COVID-19 severe disease progression. The indicators were scaled to a common measurement scale, spatially overlaid via arithmetic mean and equally weighted. The indices were classified into seven classes, 1-2 denoted low-vulnerability and 6-7 high-vulnerability. The population within vulnerabilities classes was quantified. Results: The spatial variation of each index was heterogeneous across Kenya. Forty-nine north-western and partly eastern sub-counties (6.9 m people) were highly vulnerable while 58 sub-counties (9.7 m people) in western and central Kenya were the least vulnerable for SVI. For EVI, 48 sub-counties (7.2 m people) in central and the adjacent areas and 81 sub-counties (13.2 m people) in northern Kenya were the most and least vulnerable respectively. Overall (SEVI), 46 sub-counties (7.0 m people) around central and south-eastern were more vulnerable while 81 sub-counties (14.4 m people) that were least vulnerable. Conclusion: The vulnerability indices created are tools relevant to the county, national government and stakeholders for prioritization and improved planning especially in highly vulnerable sub-counties where cases have not been confirmed. The heterogeneous nature of the vulnerability highlights the need to address social determinants of health disparities, strengthen the health system and establish programmes to cushion against the negative effects of the pandemic.","Macharia, P.

However, we lack insights into local communities’ experiences in coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study explored both the impact of, and response to, COVID-19 within the Orthodox Jewish communities of Antwerp (Belgium) during the first lockdown period (March 2020 – May 2020). METHODS: We conducted an explorative qualitative study using a participatory approach. First, we performed a community mapping to identify relevant stakeholders. Through the active involvement of a community advisory board and based on qualitative interviews with key-informants and community members, we elicited lived experiences, attitudes, and perceptions towards COVID-19. Interviews were conducted both face-to-face and using online web conferencing technology. Data were analyzed inductively according to the principles of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Government-issued outbreak control measures presented context-specific challenges to the Orthodox Jewish communities in Antwerp. They related mainly to the remote organization of religious life, and practicing physical distancing in socially and culturally strongly connected communities. Existing community resources were rapidly mobilized to adapt to the outbreak and to self-organize response initiatives within communities. The active involvement of community and religious leaders in risk communication proved to be of great importance to facilitate the coverage and uptake of pandemic control measures while protecting essential community values and traditions. Creating bottom-up and community-adapted communication strategies, including addressing language barriers and involving Rabbis in the dissemination of prevention messages, fostered a feeling of trust in government’s response measures. However, unmet information and prevention needs were also identified, such as the need for inclusive communication by public authorities and the need to mitigate the negative effects of stigmatization. CONCLUSION: The experiences of Orthodox Jewish communities in Antwerp demonstrate a valuable example of a feasible community-centered approach to health emergencies. Increasing the engagement of communities in local decision-making and governance structures remains a key strategy to respond to unmet information and prevention needs.","Vanhamel, Jef; Meudec, Marie; Van Landeghem, Ella; Ronse, Maya; Gryseels, Charlotte; Reyniers, Thijs; Rotsaert, Anke; Ddungu, Charles; Manirankunda, Lazare; Katsuva, Deogratias; Grietens, Koen Peeters; Nöstlinger, Christiana",Int J Equity Health,436,22

These vulnerable individuals, however, do not seek receive or seek help from mental health services. Telephone-based psychosocial interventions are potential strategies in augmenting mental health care in such persons. METHODS: We aim to compare the efficacy of telephone-based psychosocial interventions (TBPI) with routine telephone reminders in persons with recent suicide attempts using a multi-site, parallel group, rater-blind, two-arm randomized controlled trial design in 362 participants. In the first group, participants will receive three sessions of TBPI comprising of brief supportive interventions, problem-solving strategies, and reminders for adherence to prescribed mental health treatment at weekly intervals. In the second group, participants will receive three telephone reminders for adherence to prescribed mental health treatment at weekly intervals. We will follow up participants for 6 months. Primary outcomes are suicidal ideation scores on Beck’s Scale for Suicide Ideation and number of repeat suicide attempts. Secondary outcomes are scores on Beck’s Hopelessness Scale, Beck’s Depression Inventory, Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale and Visual Analogue Rating Scales for acceptability of interventions. Outcomes will be assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months after receiving telephone interventions or reminders. RESULTS: The trial is currently underway after prospective registration under Clinical Trials Registry of India and has recruited 260 participants till August 15, 2020.

In addition, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) was approved as a parallel approach for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET), in addition to small bowel NET, after the NETTER-1 trial. The current ESMO and NCCN guidelines attempted to describe treatment algorithms for pancreatic NET based on the current data. In our survey, we recorded therapy decisions for the first- until the third-line of therapy in German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) using fictional case reports and discussed these in the context of the current ESMO guidelines. Compared with the recommendations of the guidelines, PRRT was used more frequently and earlier. In patients with NET G1/G2 Ki-67 < 10%, the therapy algorithm consisting of somatostatin analogs (SSA)-PRRT-targeted therapy is a relevant approach. In clinical situations where chemotherapy is primarily used (remission pressure, Ki-67 > 10%), second-line PRRT was found acceptance and was often considered prior to targeted therapies. Despite the lack of prospective controlled trials, our study demonstrated the pivotal impact of PRRT. Therefore, further studies should compare PRRT with chemotherapy in pancreatic NETs in different clinical settings in first- and second-line approaches.","Krug, Sebastian; Damm, Marko; Garbe, Jakob; König, Senta; Schmitz, Rosa Lynn; Michl, Patrick; Schrader, Jörg; Rinke, Anja",J Clin Med,436,20

Although kidney transplant recipients are at increased risk of viral infections, the impact of their chronic immunosuppressed status on the risk of acquiring coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and disease severity is unknown. STUDY DESIGN: All cases of COVID-19 infection in our cohort of kidney transplant recipients were prospectively monitored. Clinical features, management and outcomes were recorded. A standard strategy of immunosuppression minimization was applied: discontinue the antimetabolite drug and reduce trough levels of calcineurin or mTOR inhibitors. Unless contraindicated, hydroxychloroquine was administered only to hospitalized patients. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 22 COVID-19 infections were diagnosed in our cohort of 1200 kidney transplant recipients. RESULTS: Most common initial symptoms included fever, cough, or dyspnea. Eighteen patients (82%) required hospitalization. Of those patients, 3 had everolimus-based immunosuppression. Chest computerized tomography (CT) at admission (performed in 15 patients) showed mild (n=3), moderate (n=8), extensive (n=1), severe (n=2), and critical (n=1) involvement. Immunosuppression reduction was initiated in all patients. Hydroxychloroquine was administered to 15 patients. Eleven patients required supplemental oxygen; 2 of them were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with mechanical ventilation. After a median of 10 days, 13 kidney transplant recipients were discharged, 2 were hospitalized in non- ICU, 1 was in ICU, and 2 patients had died. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size and short follow-up.

The sandstorm dust contains environmental pollutants, microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. These events are the primary sources of air pollution and its long-distance transport. Thus, sandstorms are becoming a greater concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this novel study aimed to investigate the effect of a sandstorm on ""environmental pollutants particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and day-to-day new cases and deaths due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection"" in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. On March 12, 2021, a sandstorm occurred in the Riyadh region, the capital city of Saudi Arabia. The data on PM 2.5, CO, NO2, and O3 were recorded three weeks before and three weeks after the onset of the sandstorm, from February 20, 2021, to March 12, 2021, and from March 13 to April 2, 2021. The daily PM2.5, CO, NO2, and O3 levels were documented from the metrological websites, and Air Quality Index-AQI, COVID-19 daily cases, and deaths were obtained from Saudi Arabia's official coronavirus website. After sandstorm, the air pollutants, CO level increased by 84.25%; PM2.5: 76.71%; O3: 40.41%; NO2: 12.03%; and SARS-CoV-2 cases increased by 33.87%. However, the number of deaths decreased by 22.39%. The sandstorm event significantly increased the air pollutants, PM2.5, CO, and O3, which were temporally associated with increased SARS-COV-2 cases. However, no significant difference was noticed in NO2 and the number of deaths after the sandstorm. The findings have an important message to health authorities to timely provide information to the public about the sandstorm and its associated health problems, including SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths.","Meo, Sultan Ayoub; Almutairi, Faris Jamal; Abukhalaf, Abdulelah Adnan; Alessa, Omar Mohammed; Al-Khlaiwi, Thamir; Meo, Anusha Sultan",Sci Total Environ,436,20

In particular, peptides have a wide range of physiological functions, including as anticancer agents and in lowering blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels, enhancing immunity, and promoting calcium absorption. Soy protein can be partially hydrolyzed enzymatically to physiologically active soy (or soybean) peptides (SPs), which not only exert physiological functions but also help amino acid absorption in the body and reduce bitterness by hydrolyzing hydrophobic amino acids from the C- or N-terminus of soy proteins. They also possess significant gel-forming, emulsifying, and foaming abilities. SPs are expected to be able to prevent and treat atherosclerosis by inhibiting the reabsorption of bile acids in the digestive system, thereby reducing blood cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and fat levels. In addition, soy contains blood pressure-lowering peptides that inhibit angiotensin-I converting enzyme activity and antithrombotic peptides that inhibit platelet aggregation, as well as anticancer, antioxidative, antimicrobial, immunoregulatory, opiate-like, hypocholesterolemic, and antihypertensive activities. In animal models, neuroprotective and cognitive capacity as well as cardiovascular activity have been reported. SPs also inhibit chronic kidney disease and tumor cell growth by regulating the expression of genes associated with apoptosis, inflammation, cell cycle arrest, invasion, and metastasis. Recently, various functions of soybeans, including their physiologically active functions, have been applied to health-oriented foods, functional foods, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.

As severe forms of COVID-19 in adults included an aberrant systemic immune response, children with chronic systemic inflammatory diseases were cautiously followed. No evidence for a specific susceptibility was identified in this pediatric population. European and US Pediatricians started to notice cases of myocarditis, sharing some features with toxic shock syndrome, Kawasaki disease, and macrophage activation syndrome in otherwise healthy patients. Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome (PIMS) have designated this new entity in the US and Europe, respectively. The spectrum of severity ranged from standard hospitalization to pediatric intensive care unit management. Most patients had a clinical history of exposure to COVID-19 patients and/or SARS-COV2 biological diagnosis. Clinical presentations include fever, cardiac involvement, gastro-intestinal symptoms, mucocutaneous manifestations, hematological features, or other organ dysfunctions. The temporal association between the pandemic peaks and outbreaks of PIMS seems to be in favor of a post-infectious, immune-mediated mechanism. Thus, SARS-CoV2 can rarely be associated with severe systemic inflammatory manifestations in previously healthy children differently from adults highlighting the specific need for COVID-19 research in the pediatric population.","Schvartz, Adrien; Belot, Alexandre; Kone-Paut, Isabelle",Front Pediatr,436,8

Rather than approach the classification problem as a task for humans or machine learning algorithms, this work leverages user–user and user–media (i.e.,media likes) interactions to infer the type of information (fake vs. authentic) being spread, without needing to know the actual details of the information itself. To study the inception and evolution of user–user and user–media interactions over time, we create an experimental platform that mimics the functionality of real-world social media networks. We develop a graphical model that considers the evolution of this network topology to model the uncertainty (entropy) propagation when fake and authentic media disseminates across the network. The creation of a real-world social media network enables a wide range of hypotheses to be tested pertaining to users, their interactions with other users, and with media content. The discovery that the entropy of user–user and user–media interactions approximate fake and authentic media likes, enables us to classify fake media in an unsupervised learning manner.","Prakash, Sakthi Kumar Arul; Tucker, Conrad",Sci Rep,436,12

The authors highlight the importance of the societal consequences of the outbreak and changes in the world of work to manage occupational health. The key points identified - such as individual socio-economic factors, psychological effects and occupations with highest risk of contamination - modify return-to-work approaches. It is estimated that around 800 million people of working age worldwide were living with disabilities before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In early January 2021, the cumulative COVID-19 hospitalisation rate reached 207.4/100 000 (18-49-year-olds) and 505.7/100 000 (50-64-year-olds), respectively, in the United States (3). In France, the hospitalisation rate was 411.5/100 000 across all ages (4). A recent cohort study of working-age men who were hospitalised for COVID-19 highlighted the long-term health consequences of such a disease (5). The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic creates new challenges for occupational health, shifting attention away from return-to-work after health problems to resuming work during an outbreak, dealing with lockdown, and taking special account of workers with vulnerabilities (6, 7). We recommend considering three different aspects of occupational medicine during a pandemic. Firstly, for most workers at high-risk of severe COVID-19, the issues of work disability and resuming work had never occurred before the epidemic. Recommendations such as physical and social distancing and wearing a facemask are highly advisable to protect against infection but may not be enough to enable some individuals to resume work. Therefore, decision-making requires individual comprehensive assessments of the underlying medical condition, the SARS-CoV-2 contamination risk associated with either regular work or teleworking, and vaccination opportunities. The second situation concerns workers who have suffered from COVID-19. Preliminary studies suggest that long recovery duration is related to high severity (7), but this is still a matter of debate for patients suffering from ""long COVID-19"" (5, 8, 9), a condition for which the long-term effects remain unknown. Any long-running recovery must be considered to be a potential sign of long COVID-19. These long-lasting syndromes occur among patients with severe symptoms but have also been reported independently of acute phase severity, hospitalisation and receiving medical oxygen (8, 9). Researchers worldwide are currently investigating such syndromes. Strategies promoting return to work for these workers will need to be implemented and could be similar to programmes developed for other chronic conditions. Moreover, numerous more serious sequelae following critical illness suggest the need for enhanced support by rehabilitation and occupational health specialists. Finally, the consequences of the epidemic must be evaluated over time for people who suffered from functional limitations before COVID-19 as their physical and mental condition may be modified by the epidemic and, specifically, the consequences of lockdown (10). In all of these situations, medical, social, financial and working contexts are key elements. In addition to a medical assessment, the use of scales such as the Work Ability Index (WAI) (11) or the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) (12) can help perform long-term follow-up and provide information about work capacity and workload. It also gives a ""back to basics"" perspective, urging politicians to move towards a `decent-work-for-all` policy, as advocated by the United Nation`s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, which the WHO has endorsed (13).

During infectious disease outbreaks the weakest communities are more vulnerable to the infection and its deleterious effects. In Israel, the Arab and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities have unique demographic and cultural characteristics that place them at risk for infection. Objective. To examine the socioeconomic and ethnic differences in relation to COVID-19 testing, cases and deaths, and to analyze infection spread patterns in ethnically diverse communities. Methods. Consecutive data on COVID-19 diagnostic testing, confirmed cases and deaths collected from March 31st through May 1st, 2020 in 174 localities across Israel (84% of the population) were analyzed by socioeconomic ranking and ethnicity. Findings. Tests were performed on 331,594 individuals (4.29% of the total population). Of those, 14,865 individuals (4.48%) were positive and 203 died (1.37% of confirmed cases). The percentage of the population tested was 26% and the risk of testing positive was 2.16 times higher in the lowest, compared with the highest socioeconomic category. The proportion of confirmed cases was 4.96 times higher in the Jewish compared with the Arab population. The rate of confirmed cases in 2 Ultra-Orthodox localities increased relatively early and quickly. Other Jewish and Arab localities showed consistently low rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases, regardless of socioeconomic ranking. Interpretation Culturally different communities reacted differently to the COVID-19 outbreak and to government measures, resulting in different outcomes. Therefore, socioeconomic and ethnic variables cannot fully explain communities reaction to the pandemic. Our findings stress the need for designing a culturally adapted approach for dealing with health crises.","Saban, Mor; Shachar, Tal; Miron, Oren; Meron, Rachel Wilf",,436,22

This was first described in the Wuhan province of the People's Republic of China. SARS-CoV-2 spread throughout the world causing a global pandemic. To date, thousands of cases of COVID-19 were reported in the United Kingdom, and over 45,000 patients have died. Some progress has been achieved in managing this disease, but the biological determinants of health, besides age, that affect COVID-19 infectivity and mortality are under scrutiny. Recent studies show that several medical conditions, including diabetes and hypertension, increase the risk of COVID-19 infection and death. The increased vulnerability of the elderly and those with comorbidities, together with the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases with advanced age, led us to investigate the links between neurodegeneration and COVID-19. We analysed the primary health records of 13,338 UK individuals tested for COVID-19 between March and July 2020. We show that a pre-existing diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease predicts the highest risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality among the elderly. In contrast, Parkinson's disease patients were found to be at increased risk of infection but not mortality from COVID-19. We conclude that there are disease-specific differences in COVID-19 susceptibility among patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders.","Yu, Y.; Travaglio, M.; Popovic, R.; Leal, N.

OBJECTIVES: Identify demographic factors, comorbid conditions, and symptoms independently associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study. SETTING: Veterans Health Administration. PATIENTS: Persons tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) between March 1 and May 14, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Associations between demographic characteristics, diagnosed comorbid conditions, and documented symptoms with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Of 88,747 persons tested, 10,131 (11.4%) were SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive. Positivity was associated with older age (≥80 vs. <50 years: aOR 2.16, 95% CI 1.97-2.37), male sex (aOR 1.45, 95% CI 1.34-1.57), regional SARS-CoV-2 burden (≥2,000 vs. <400 cases/million: aOR 5.43, 95% CI 4.97-5.93), urban residence (aOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.70-1.87), Black (aOR 2.15, 95% CI 2.05-2.26) or American Indian/Alaska Native/Pacific Islander (aOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.05-1.52) vs. White race, and Hispanic ethnicity (aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.40-1.65). Obesity and diabetes were the only two medical conditions associated with testing positive. Documented fevers, chills, cough, and diarrhea were also associated with testing positive. The population attributable fraction of positive tests was highest for regional SARS-CoV-2 burden (35.3%), followed by demographic variables (27.2%), symptoms (12.0%), obesity (10.5%), and diabetes (0.4%). LIMITATIONS: Lack of information on SARS-CoV-2 exposures or the indications for testing which may affect the likelihood of testing positive. CONCLUSION: The majority of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests were attributed to regional SARS-CoV-2 burden, demographic characteristics and obesity with a minor contribution of chronic comorbid conditions.","Fan, Vincent S; Dominitz, Jason A; Eastment, McKenna C; Locke, Emily; Green, Pamela; Berry, Kristin; O’Hare, Ann M; Shah, Javeed A; Crothers, Kristina; Ioannou, George N",Clin Infect Dis,436,14

Objectives: We aim to provide early predictions of individual patients' intensive care unit length of stay, which might improve resource allocation and patient care during the on-going pandemic. Methods: We developed a new semiparametric distributional index model depending on covariates which are available within 24h after intensive care unit admission. The model was trained on a large cohort of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients out of the Minimal Dataset of the Swiss Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Then, we predict individual length of stay of patients in the RISC-19-ICU registry. Measurements: The RISC-19-ICU Investigators for Switzerland collected data of 557 critically ill patients with COVID-19. Main Results: The model gives probabilistically and marginally calibrated predictions which are more informative than the empirical length of stay distribution of the training data. However, marginal calibration was worse after approximately 20 days in the whole cohort and in different subgroups. Long staying COVID-19 patients have shorter length of stay than regular acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. We found differences in LoS with respect to age categories and gender but not in regions of Switzerland with different stress of intensive care unit resources. Conclusion: A new probabilistic model permits calibrated and informative probabilistic prediction of LoS of individual patients with COVID-19. Long staying patients could be discovered early. The model may be the basis to simulate stochastic models for bed occupation in intensive care units under different casemix scenarios.","Henzi, A.; Kleger, G.-R.; Hilty, M. P.; Wendel Garcia, P.

Bamlanivimab, developed from human convalescent plasma, was the first monoclonal antibody to become available for emergency use in several countries. Expectations related to its use in COVID-19 patients as a single agent have been largely disregarded, especially against E484K-carrying SARS-CoV-2 variants. Areas covered: In this drug discovery case history, the development of the drug is described starting from the identification and selection of the antibody, from the pre-clinical and clinical trials up to the post-authorization phase. Expert opinion: Bamlanivimab has shown some efficacy in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Initially approved as a monotherapy, due to poor efficacy it is currently only usable in combination with etesevimab. Pharmacokinetic limitations and mainly the onset of SARS-CoV-2 variants are the main reasons for this limited clinical use. The use in preventing hospitalization also has ethical limits related to the sustainability of care, especially if, considering similar effectiveness, bamlanivimab is compared with convalescent plasma.","Tuccori, Marco; Convertino, Irma; Ferraro, Sara; Valdiserra, Giulia; Cappello, Emiliano; Fini, Elisabetta; Focosi, Daniele",Expert Opin Drug Discov,436,3

To explore this line of argument, this paper examines Crunchbase real-time data examining entrepreneurial finance investments in China during unfolding Covid-19 crisis. The paper shows that these equity investments slumped dramatically in the immediate aftermath of the Covid-19 virus, resulting in a year on year decrease of 60% in the total volume of investment raised between quarter 1 in 2019 and quarter 1 in 2020. Importantly, the paper found early-stage seed investments falling the steepest, suggesting nascent start-ups are those most heavily affected by the crisis. While the global financial crisis heavily hit debt markets, the relational nature of equity investments may mean entrepreneurial finance is even more susceptible to major upheaval caused by the Covid-19 crisis. Overall, enterprise policy makers need to become better attuned at monitoring real-time data sources to mitigate chronic entrepreneurial uncertainty via strategic policy responses.","Brown, Ross; Rocha, Augusto",Journal of Business Venturing Insights,436,9

IBV causes a highly contagious disease affecting the respiratory tract and, depending on the strain, other tissues including the reproductive and urogenital tract. The control of IBV in the field is hampered by the many different strains circulating worldwide and the limited protection across strains due to serotype diversity. This diversity is believed to be due to the amino acid variation in the S1 domain of the major viral attachment protein spike. In the last years, much effort has been undertaken to address the role of the avian coronavirus spike protein in the various steps of the virus’ live cycle. Various models have successfully been developed to elucidate the contribution of the spike in binding of the virus to cells, entry of cell culture cells and organ explants, and the in vivo tropism and pathogenesis. This review will give an overview of the literature on avian coronavirus spike proteins with particular focus on our recent studies on binding of recombinant soluble spike protein to chicken tissues. With this, we aim to summarize the current understanding on the avian coronavirus spike's contribution to host and tissue predilections, pathogenesis, as well as its role in therapeutic and protective interventions.","Wickramasinghe, I.N.

METHODS: In February 2021 to March 2021, we surveyed parent members of a nationally representative probability-based Internet panel of â¼9000 adults regarding their intent to have their children receive a COVID-19 vaccination, perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines for children, and trust in sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines for children. We used descriptive and multivariate analyses to evaluate parent-stated likelihood of having their children get a COVID-19 vaccine and to assess the association between likelihood of child COVID-19 vaccination and child age, parent demographics, and parental perceptions about COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS: Altogether, 1745 parents responded (87% of eligible parents, 3759 children). Likelihood of child COVID-19 vaccination was as follows: very likely (28%), somewhat likely (18%), somewhat unlikely (9%), very unlikely (33%), and unsure (12%). The stated likelihood of child vaccination was greater among parents of older children (P < .001) as well as among parents who had a bachelor's degree or higher education (P < .001), had already received or were likely to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (P < .001), or had Democratic affiliation (P < .001); variations existed by race and ethnicity (P = .04). Parental concerns centered around vaccine safety and side effects. A key trusted source of information about COVID-19 vaccines for children was the child's doctor. CONCLUSIONS: Less than one-half of US participants report that they are likely to have their child receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

The perpetuation of this situation has given rise to a new syndrome of the unemployed. If these effects of economic downsizing are accompanied by the magnitude of the current situation brought about by COVID-19, the results can be devastating for the individuals and families experiencing it. Objective: To compare the symptoms of the unemployed syndrome in three population groups. Method: Three groups were studied: short-term unemployed (n = 91), long-term unemployed (n = 150), and those unemployed during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 94). Unemployment syndrome was assessed with the Unemployment Syndrome Scale (USS). The three population groups were contacted through web pages, social networks, etc. and answered the instruments online in a single session. Once the responses were obtained, their information was encoded in a database and analysed through the SPSS v. 21 program.

Therefore, we exposed animals to a mixture of dioxins, furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that included TCDD, 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (PeCDD), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF), 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (1-PeCDF), 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (4-PeCDF), octachlorodibenzofuran (OCDF), 3,3′,4,4′-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB77), 3,3′,4,4′,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126), and 3,3′,4,4′,5,5′-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB169). The mixture composition approximated the relative abundance of these compounds in foodstuff (L. S. Birnbaum and M. J. DeVito, 1995, Toxicology Vol. 105, pp. 391–401). Following the work of Gray et al. with TCDD (1997, Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology Vol. 146, pp. 11–20), we exposed time-pregnant dams on gestation day (GD) 15 at doses up to 1.0 μg TCDD toxic equivalency (TEQ)/kg and the development of offspring was monitored. This mixture significantly increased the time to puberty in both male and female offspring. At postnatal day (PND) 32 seminal vesicle weights were decreased; however, only ventral prostate weight was affected at PND 49 and no effects were seen at PND 63. In female offspring, the mixture caused dose-dependent increases in the incidence of vaginal thread. Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity was higher than with TCDD the comparable TEQ exposure. Based on the slightly lowered responsiveness to the mixture, we used 2.0 μg TEQ/kg to examine reproductive effects. This dose elicited the responses observed with 1.0 μg TCDD/kg. Results indicate that the mixture causes a similar spectrum of effects seen with TCDD and the slightly lowered degree of response based on administered dose appears to be due to decreased transfer of mixture components to the offspring. Thus, the use of the WHO consensus TEFs (M. Van den Berg et al., 1998, Environ. Health Perspec. 106, 775–792) reasonably predicts the developmental toxicity of this mixture of dioxin-like PHAHs.","Hamm, J. T.; Chen, C.-Y.; Birnbaum, L. S.",Toxicol Sci,436,25

In this study, we found that PHEV infection upregulates miR-142a-3p RNA expression in N2a cells and in the CNS of mice. Downregulation of miR-142a-3p by an miRNA inhibitor led to a significant repression of viral proliferation, implying that it acts as a positive regulator of PHEV proliferation. Using a dual-luciferase reporter assay, miR-142a-3p was found to bind directly bound to the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of Rab3a mRNA and downregulate its expression. Knockdown of Rab3a expression by transfection with an miR-142a-3p mimic or Rab3a siRNA significantly increased PHEV replication in N2a cells. Conversely, the use of an miR-142a-3p inhibitor or overexpression of Rab3a resulted in a marked restriction of viral production at both the mRNA and protein level. Our data demonstrate that miR-142a-3p promotes PHEV proliferation by directly targeting Rab3a mRNA, and this provides new insights into the mechanisms of PHEV-related pathogenesis and virus-host interactions.","Fan, Peng; Guan, Jiyu; He, Wenqi; Lv, Xiaoling; Hu, Shiyu; Lan, Yungang; Zhao, Kui; Gao, Feng; Li, Fang; Fan, Gencheng; He, Hongbin; Li, Zi",Arch Virol,436,20

There are limited data available on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with hematological malignancies with more than 60 days of follow-up. This study describes the clinical characteristics, including multiple recurrences of COVID-19, in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) during 69 days of follow-up. Case Presentation: A 72-year-old female was admitted to hospital isolation after being infected with COVID-19 as part of a family cluster on January 30, 2020. Apart from SARS-Cov-2 virus infection, laboratory results revealed lymphocytosis of uncertain etiology and abnormal distribution of T lymphocytes. On blood smears, small blue lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm were observed, and the presence of high levels of circulating clonal B cells was also demonstrated by flow cytometry. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 and CLL. Among her family members, she had the highest viral loads and the fastest progression on lung injury and developed severe pneumonia. Serological results showed she had both 2019-nCoV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies; however, only IgG antibodies were detected in her husband's plasma. Results: A combination regimen of antiviral therapy and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the early stage seemed to be effective for treating CLL and SARS-Cov-2 infection. Because of the low humoral immune response, the CLL patient could not effectively clear the SARS-Cov-2 infection and suffered from recurrence twice during the 69-day follow-up. Conclusion: In CLL, a neoplastic antigen-specific B-cell clone proliferates, and the progeny cells accumulate and outgrow other B cells, leading to immune deficiency. Considering the low humoral immune response and ineffective clearance of SARS-Cov-2 in CLL patients, the follow-up and home quarantine period should be extended. We need further studies to clarify suspending or continuing CLL therapy during COVID infection. For those patients who are prone to progression to severe disease, administering humoral immunity therapies can help to prevent disease progression and quickly meet the cure criteria.","Ye, Xingnong; Xiao, Xiaofang; Li, Bin; Zhu, Weigang; Li, Youjiang; Wu, Jianguo; Huang, Xin; Jin, Jingxia; Chen, Dan; Jin, Jie; Huang, Jian",Front Oncol,436,1

Here, we extracted and characterized TCR β-chain (TRB) genes from the recently sequenced rhesus macaque genome that are homologous to the human TRB genes. Comparison of the rhesus macaque TRB genes with the human TRB genes revealed an average best-match similarity of 92.9%. Furthermore, we confirmed the usage of most rhesus macaque TRB genes by expressed TCRβ sequences within epitope-specific TCR repertoires. This primary description of the rhesus macaque TRB genes will provide a standardized nomenclature and enable better characterization of TCR usage in studies that utilize this species.","Greenaway, Hui Yee; Kurniawan, Monica; Price, David A; Douek, Daniel C; Davenport, Miles P; Venturi, Vanessa",Immunol Cell Biol,436,5

The Recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus-based candidate vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) has demonstrated clinical efficacy against Ebola in ring-vaccination clinical trials. In order to evaluate the potential effect of this candidate vaccine, we developed risk equations for the daily risk of Ebola infection both currently and after vaccination. The risk equations account for the basic transmission probability of Ebola and the lowered risk due to various protection protocols: vaccination, hazmat suits, reduced contact with the infected living and dead bodies. Parameter space was sampled using Latin Hypercube Sampling, a statistical method for generating a near-random sample of parameter values. We found that at a high transmission rate of Ebola (i.e., if the transmission rate is greater than 90%), a large fraction of the population must be vaccinated ( 80%) to achieve a 50% decrease in the daily risk of infection. If a vaccine is introduced, it must have at least 50% efficacy, and almost everyone in the affected areas must receive it to effectively control outbreaks of Ebola. These results indicate that a low-efficacy Ebola vaccine runs the risk of having vaccinated people be overconfident in a weak vaccine and hence the possibility that the vaccine could make the situation worse, unless the population can be sufficiently educated about the necessity for high vaccine uptake.","Abo, Stéphanie M.C.; Smith, Robert",Infect Dis Model,436,24

The main causes of respiratory tract infections in children are viruses and the most common types are upper respiratory tract infections: common cold, pharyngitis, otitis media and sinusitis. Pneumonia is much more serious. As well as viruses, bacteria are often involved in respiratory tract infections. Three bacterial species are most commonly isolated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. The most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis is Streptococcus pyogenes. Bacteria isolated from community-acquired infection usually are sensitive to the majority of suitable drugs, but during the past two decades, significant antibiotic resistance has emerged. Resistance to penicillins has spread among H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. The mechanism of penicillin resistance in H. influenzae is mainly by production of β-lactamases TEM-1 and ROB-1, whereas in S. pneumoniae resistance is an effect of the changes in penicillin binding proteins. Among respiratory pathogens, resistance to tetracyclines, macrolides, trimethoprim–sulphamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones has also appeared. Several mechanisms depending on changes in target, active efflux and modifying enzymes are involved.","Mlynarczyk, G; Mlynarczyk, A; Jeljaszewicz, J",International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents,436,16

These benefits have been more consistently shown among individuals navigating stressful situations and among those who have a strong attachment to their pet. Recent research suggests that older adults who walk their dogs experience fewer symptoms of loneliness than those who do not walk their dogs. The current study was designed to evaluate whether dog walking helps older adults facing significant social consequences related to the COVID-19 pandemic avoid increased feelings of loneliness. Our study shows that those who reported that COVID-19 had a significant impact on their social lives reported higher levels of loneliness, but if they walked their dog at least once a day, they did not become lonelier despite the social consequences of the pandemic. We conclude that dog walking could be a beneficial therapy in relation to loneliness for individuals who experience significant social setbacks. Further research is needed to determine why dog walking is beneficial, and whether individuals only obtain these benefits when walking their own dog, or if they can also experience benefits when walking with other people’s dogs. ABSTRACT: Pet ownership can provide important companionship and facilitate social connections, which may be particularly important to socially isolated older adults. Given the significant deleterious impact of loneliness on health and wellbeing in later life, many predicted that public safety measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic would greatly increase loneliness, particularly among vulnerable populations like older adults. We investigated whether dog walking buffers loneliness in the context of stressors imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Longitudinal survey data were obtained from a Florida community-based sample of adults (n = 466) aged 60+ years old in September 2018 and October 2020. Using OLS regression models, we tested: a) the association between the social consequences of COVID-19 and changes in loneliness, and b) the buffering effect of dog walking on this relationship. The high social consequences of COVID-19 were related to increases in loneliness. Walking a dog daily buffered the relationship. These results suggest potential therapeutic effects of dog walking for the promotion of mental health in older adults, particularly in the context of stressful situations that accentuate risks for loneliness.","Carr, Dawn; Friedmann, Erika; Gee, Nancy R.; Gilchrist, Chelsea; Sachs-Ericsson, Natalie; Koodaly, Lincy",Animals (Basel),436,16

Vaccines offer the best hope for controlling its deleterious effects, but not everybody is willing to be vaccinated, so it is important to explore variables that might predict vaccination willingness. The present study addressed this by drawing upon the Social Identity Approach, which posits that people's membership of social groups is consequential for their thoughts and behaviour. Specifically, it was predicted that people's strength of identification with their local community (a social group that came to particular prominence during the pandemic) would positively predict their willingness to engage in community‐related prosocial normative behaviour (i.e., their perceived sense of duty, as a community member, to get vaccinated) and that this, in turn, would predict higher levels of vaccination willingness. Participants (N = 130) completed an online survey, which supported the hypothesized mediation model, even after controlling for subjective neighbourhood socio‐economic status and age (two variables that are particularly likely to impact upon vaccination willingness). To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply Social Identity Approach principles to the study of COVID‐19 vaccination willingness. The implications of the findings for governments' efforts to boost vaccine uptake are discussed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study integrates multiple health care administrative data sources from 2010 through 2014, analyzed through an interrupted time series design and a hierarchical Bayesian model. We compared managed care physicians using CEHRT to a propensity-score matched comparisons from network physicians who did not adopt CEHRT. Inclusion criteria for physicians using CEHRT included attesting to the Childhood Immunization Status clinical quality measure in addition to meeting “Meaningful Use” (MU) during calendar year 2013. We used a first-presence patient attribution approach to develop provider-specific immunization scores. RESULTS: We evaluated 147 providers using CEHRT, with 147 propensity-score matched providers selected from a pool of 1253 PCPs practicing in Maryland. The estimate for change in odds of increasing immunization rates due to CEHRT was 1.2 (95% credible set, 0.88 to 1.73). DISCUSSION: We created a method for estimating immunization quality scores using Bayesian modeling. Our approach required linking separate administrative data sets, constructing a propensity-score matched cohort, and using first-presence, claims-based childhood visit information for patient attribution. In the absence of integrated data sets and precise and accurate patient attribution, this is a reusable method for researchers and health system administrators to estimate the impact of health information technology on individual, provider-level, process-based, though outcomes-focused, quality measures. CONCLUSION: This research has provided evidence for using Bayesian analysis of propensity-score matched provider populations to estimate the impact of CEHRT on outcomes-based quality measures such as childhood immunization delivery.","Messino, Paul J.; Kharrazi, Hadi; Kim, Julia M.; Lehmann, Harold",J Biomed Inform,436,29

Each year, more than 2 million men and women have access to modern contraceptive methods in Colombia. However, amid the pandemic, disruptions in supply chains, the interruption of essential services for sexual and reproductive health, and social inequalities may jeopardize these gains in contraception among Venezuelan migrants and refugees. The measurement of inequalities focuses on identifying the epicenter of inequity that is particularly relevant within the humanitarian response under strain. The objective of this article is to identify inequalities in access to contraception services among the migrant and refugee populations in six cities that concentrate 70% of the Venezuelan migration into Colombia and to discuss the challenges they represent for future emergencies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a cross-sectional, descriptive study that included a mixed research approach (quantitative and qualitative analyses) based on three activities: i) analysis of contraceptive care records for the period 2018–2019; ii) measurement of inequalities in access to contraceptive services, and iii) design and implementation of twelve focus groups among Venezuelan migrants and refugees for discussion. RESULTS: Despite the evidence of a 70% increase in the use of contraceptive services among Venezuelan migrants between 2018 and 2019, there are absolute and relative inequalities in access to contraceptive methods both in the migrant and refugee populations versus the host population. The inequalities are mainly explained by the demographic dependency rate and the lack of job opportunities.

In addition, detection of the newly generated short RNAs by cellular pattern recognition receptors, MDA5 and RIG-I, further enhances IFN production and the ensuing antiviral activities. The intracellular concentration of 2-5A is believed to be the primary factor controlling RNase L activation. The liver contains abundant innate immune cells, which provide the first line of defense against pathogens. However, the factors that determine whether a virus can bypass this defense to access and infect the liver parenchyma are not well understood. The murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), strain A59, infection of mice provides a model for virus induced hepatitis. The MHV accessory protein, ns2, antagonizes the type I IFN response in macrophages and promotes the induction of hepatitis. Here we will describe how the ns2 protein facilitates the development of viral hepatitis by blocking OAS-RNase L pathway. Methods Bone marrow macrophages (BMM) from wild type (wt) and RNase L−/− mice were infected with A59 and ns2 mutant MHV. Viral titers were determined by plaque assays. RNase L activity was monitored by rRNA integrity in RNA chips. Intracellular levels of 2-5A were measured using RNase L activation assays. Effects of ns2 on 2-5A levels in cells were determined by transfecting ns2 or mutant ns2 cDNAs into HEK-293T cells. Recombinant ns2 and mutant ns2H126R proteins were purified and incubated with 2-5A in vitro and the 2-5A breakdown products were measured by HPLC. Hepatitis was determined by histology following inoculation A59 or ns2 mutant MHV into wt and RNase L−/− mice. Results We found evidence for a new molecular mechanism of subversion of the RNase L pathway in macrophages that regulates acute hepatitis during MHV infection. Coronavirus ns2 belongs to the LigT-like protein family, within the 2H phosphoesterase superfamily, some of which possess cyclophosphodiesterase activity (CPD). We have found that ns2 is not a CPD, but instead is a 2′,5′-phosphodiesterase (PDE) that cleaves, and thus eliminates 2-5A, the activator of RNase L. We observed that ns2 blocks the IFN inducible OAS-RNase L pathway to facilitate hepatitis development. Ns2 prevents activation of RNase L and consequently limits viral RNA degradation. An ns2 mutant virus was unable to replicate in the liver or induce hepatitis in wt mice, but was highly pathogenic in RNase L−/− mice. Thus, RNase L is a critical cellular factor for protection against viral infection of the liver and the resulting hepatitis. Conclusion MHV accessory protein ns2 is a 2′,5′-PDE which degrades 2-5A and limits RNase L activation thus facilitating virus-induced hepatitis in mice.","Jha, B.

However, positive psychology literature suggests that individuals with strong psychological resources can be resilient in difficult circumstances. Using a sample of 922 individuals (including 240 unemployed, 391 salary-employed, and 291 self-employed) from Uganda and Kenya, we investigated the moderating effects of locus of control and psychological capital on the association between ambiguity intolerance and eudaimonic wellbeing, comparing the unemployed with individuals in salaried and self-employment. Our findings indicated that ambiguity intolerance and external locus of control are negatively associated with eudaimonic wellbeing. Conversely, internal locus of control and psychological capital were positively associated with eudaimonic wellbeing. The moderation analysis revealed that whereas an external locus of control boosts the negative effects of ambiguity intolerance on eudaimonic wellbeing, internal locus of control and psychological capital buffer against the negative effects of ambiguity intolerance on eudaimonic wellbeing.

SARS-CoV-2 is an emergent viral disease that caused millions of COVID-19 cases all over the world. Around 15% of cases are severe and some of them are accompanied by dysregulated immune system and cytokine storm. There is increasing evidence that severe manifestations of COVID-19 might be attributed to human genetic variants in genes related to immune deficiency and or inflammasome activation (cytokine storm). OBJECTIVE: Identify the candidate genes that are likely to aid in explaining severe COVID-19 and provide insights to understand severe COVID-19. METHODS: In this article, we systematically reviewed genes related to viral susceptibility that were reported in human genetic studies (Case reports and GWAS) to understand the role of host viral interactions and to provide insights into the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. RESULTS: We found 40 genes associated with viral susceptibility and 21 of them were associated with severe SARS-CoV disease and severe COVID-19. Some of those genes were implicated in TLR pathways, others in C-lectin pathways, and others were related to inflammasome activation (cytokine storm). CONCLUSIONS: This compilation represents a list of candidate genes that are likely to aid in explaining severe COVID-19 which are worthy of inclusion in gene panels and during meta-analysis of different variants in host genetics studies of COVID-19. In addition, we provide several hypotheses for severe COVID-19 and possible therapeutic targets.","Elhabyan, Abdelazeem; El Yaacoub, Saja; Sanad, Ehab; Mohamed, Abdelwahab; Elhabyan, Asmaa; Dinu, Valentin",Virus Res,436,1

Previously, we demonstrated that immunization with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the FIPV spike protein (S) induced early death after challenge with FIPV (Vennema et al., 1990, J. Virol. 64, 1407–1409). In this paper we describe similar immunizations with the FIPV membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The genes encoding these proteins were cloned and sequenced. Comparison of the amino acid sequences with the corresponding sequences of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus revealed 84.7 and 77% identity for M and N, respectively. Vaccinia virus recombinants expressing the cloned genes induced antibodies in immunized kittens. Immunization with neither recombinant induced early death after challenge with FIPV, strongly suggesting that antibody-dependent enhancement is mediated by antibodies against S only. Immunization with the N protein recombinant had no apparent effect on the outcome of challenge. However, three of eight kittens immunized with the M protein recombinant survived the challenge, as compared to one of eight kittens of the control group.","Vennema, Harry; De Groot, Raoul J.; Harbour, David A.; Horzinek, Marian C.; Spaan, Willy J.M.",Virology,436,1

After discovering the vaccine, its acceptance by individuals is a fundamental issue for disease control. This study aimed to examine COVID-19 vaccination intention determinants based on the protection motivation theory (PMT). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in the Iranian adult population and surveyed 256 study participants from the first to the 30th of June 2020 with a web-based self-administered questionnaire. We used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to investigate the interrelationship between COVID-19 vaccination intention and perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived self-efficacy, and perceived response efficacy. RESULTS: SEM showed that perceived severity to COVID-19 (β = .17, p < .001), perceived self-efficacy about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (β = .26, p < .001), and the perceived response efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine (β = .70, p < .001) were significant predictors of vaccination intention. PMT accounted for 61.5% of the variance in intention to COVID-19 vaccination, and perceived response efficacy was the strongest predictor of COVID-19 vaccination intention. CONCLUSIONS: This study found the PMT constructs are useful in predicting COVID-19 vaccination intention. Programs designed to increase the vaccination rate after discovering the COVID-19 vaccine can include interventions on the severity of the COVID-19, the self-efficacy of individuals receiving the vaccine, and the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing infection.","Ansari-Moghaddam, Alireza; Seraji, Maryam; Sharafi, Zahra; Mohammadi, Mahdi; Okati-Aliabad, Hassan",BMC Public Health,436,20

In this work, we build parametric 3D models to assess the possible circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the natural ventilation system of a hospital built to care infected patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Building Information Modeling (BIM) was performed, generating 3D models of hospital environments utilizing Revit software for Autodesk CFD 2021. The evaluation considered dimensional analyses of 0°, 45°, 90° and 180°. The analysis of natural ventilation patterns on both internal and external surfaces and the distribution of windows in relation to the displacement dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through the air were considered. The results showed that in the external area of the hospital, the wind speed reached velocities up to 2.1 m/s when entering the building through open windows. In contact with the furniture, this value decreased to 0.78 m/s. In some internal isolation wards that house patients with COVID-19, areas that should be equipped with negative room pressure, air velocity was null.

While the characteristics of epidemic transmission are individually assessed, there are also important implicit associations between them. METHODS: A novel methodological framework was developed to overcome barriers among separate epidemic statistics and identify distinctive SARS features. Individual statistics were pair-wise linked in terms of their common features, and an integrative epidemic network was formulated. RESULTS: The study of associations between important SARS characteristics considerably enhanced the mainstream epidemic analysis and improved the understanding of the relationships between the observed epidemic determinants. The response of SARS transmission to various epidemic control factors was simulated, target areas were detected, critical time and relevant factors were determined. CONCLUSION: It was shown that by properly accounting for links between different SARS statistics, a data-based analysis can efficiently reveal systematic associations between epidemic determinants. The analysis can predict the temporal trend of the epidemic given its spatial pattern, to estimate spatial exposure given temporal evolution, and to infer the driving forces of SARS transmission given the spatial exposure distribution.","Wang, Jin-Feng; Christakos, George; Han, Wei-Guo; Meng, Bin",J Public Health (Oxf),436,24

Despite the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on racial/ethnic minorities, the extent and reliability of race reporting in COVID research is unclear. METHODS: COVID-19 research published in three top medical journals during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was reviewed and assessed for race reporting and proportional representation. RESULTS: Of the 95 manuscripts that were identified, 56 reporting on 252,262 patients met eligibility. Thirty-five (62.5%) did not report race distribution and 15 (26.7%) did not report ethnicity. There was no difference based on journal (P = 0.87), study sponsor (P = 0.41), whether the study was retrospective or prospective (P = 0.33), or observational vs interventional (P = 0.11). Studies with ≥250 patients were more likely to report on race (OR 4.01, 95% CI: 1.12–14.37, P = 0.027), and North American (USA and Canada) studies were more likely than European studies (OR 7.88, 95% CI: 1.73–37.68, P = 0.006) to report on race. COVID-19 research mirrored USA COVID-19 racial incidence; however, both showed higher distribution of COVID-19 infection among Blacks and a smaller proportion of Whites compared to the USA population. This suggests that research is broadly representing infection rates and that social determinants of health are impacting racial distribution of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing awareness of racial disparities and inequity, COVID-19 research during the first wave of the pandemic lacked appropriate racial/ethnicity reporting. However, research mirrored COVID-19 incidence in the USA, with an increased burden of infection among Black individuals.","Raghav, Kanwal; Anand, Seerat; Gothwal, Anirudh; Singh, Pooja; Dasari, Arvind; Overman, Michael J.; Loree, Jonathan M.",Int J Infect Dis,436,5

The corona virus pandemic, however, limited in-person interactions significantly and decreased the travel capabilities. Our regional burn center serves an 8-state region, and as such, our every other month in-person support group consisted of survivors and family members from a large geographic area. METHODS: Support group volunteers and staff members recognized the need for continued support of survivors during the pandemic. Limitations of large, in-person meetings were implemented by our host organization to comply with pandemic safety guidelines. Evaluation of resources available led to development of a virtually supported meeting space. Email addresses were gathered to schedule. This allowed for interaction of survivors from an unlimited geographic area. RESULTS: Support group survivor volunteers and staff met to develop parameters, topics, IT support and logistics. Every other month support group was converted to a monthly gathering virtually due to easier access by survivors. Attendees completed a survey to evaluate and make recommendations for opportunities for improvement. The same number of survivors were present for in person and virtual meetings. CONCLUSIONS: During this pandemic, limitations were placed that further isolate survivors. A virtually based support group has allowed for more frequent interactions between volunteers and new survivors. Various topics were discussed including survivor preparedness for public reintegration, worker’s compensation and care giver burnout. Speakers from multiple disciplines have been able to address issues requested by survivors. In this format, we have been able to continue the support of our survivors as they continue to recover.

Besides, control of nosocomial infections transmitted from HCWs to the patients is also a cause of concern. This study was undertaken to investigate the seroprevalence of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus among the hospital staff of a tertiary care health facility in north India. METHODS: The HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology (IgG+IgM) using chemiluminescence immunoassay between June 22 and July 24, 2020. Venous blood (2 ml) was collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies. RESULTS: Of the 3739 HCWs tested, 487 (13%) were positive for total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The highest seroprevalence was observed in administrative staff (19.6%) and least in physicians (5.4%). The staff who used public (20%) and hospital transportation (16.9%) showed higher seroprevalence compared to staff using personal transportation (12.4%). No difference was observed between HCWs posted in COVID versus non-COVID areas. All seropositive symptomatic HCWs in our study (53.6%) had mild symptoms, and the remaining 46.4 per cent were asymptomatic. The antibody positivity rate progressively increased from 7.0 per cent in the first week to 18.6 per cent in the fourth week during the study. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a significant number of asymptomatic HCWs, association with the use of public transport, relatively lower seroprevalence compared with the non-HCWs and rising trend during the period of the study highlight the need for serosurveillance, creating awareness for infection control practices including social distancing and study of infection dynamics in the community for effective control of an infectious pandemic.","Gupta, Ritu; Dwivedi, Tanima; Gajendra, Smeeta; Sahoo, Biswajeet; Gupta, Sanjeev Kumar; Vikas, H.; Singh, Angel Rajan; Mohan, Anant; Bhatnagar, Sushma; Singh, Sheetal; Wundavalli, Laxmitej; Guleria, Randeep",Indian J Med Res,436,1

Direct infestation of lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages by SARS coronavirus (CoV) has been debated as a cause of lymphopenia, but there is no convincing data. Lymphopenia can be caused by glucocorticoids, and thus any debilitating condition has the potential to induce lymphopenia via stress mechanism involving the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Cortisol levels are elevated in patients with RSV and Ebola, and cortisol was higher in SARS patients with lymphopenia before any steroid therapy. Glucocorticoids also down-regulate the production of proinflammatory lymphokines.

However, clinical manifestations and outcomes differ significantly among COVID-19 patients, ranging from asymptomatic to extremely severe, and it remains unclear what drives these disparities. Here, we studied 159 hospitalized Italian patients with pneumonia from the NIAID-NCI COVID-19 Consortium using a phage-display method to characterize circulating antibodies binding to 93,904 viral peptides encoded by 1,276 strains of human viruses. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a marked increase in individual’s immune memory antibody repertoires linked to trajectories of disease severity from the longitudinal analysis also including anti-spike protein antibodies. By applying a machine-learning-based strategy, we developed a viral exposure signature predictive of COVID-19-related disease severity linked to patient survival. These results provide a basis for understanding the roles of memory B-cell repertoires in COVID-19-related symptoms as well as a predictive tool for monitoring its clinical severity.","Wang, Limin; Candia, Julián; Ma, Lichun; Zhao, Yongmei; Imberti, Luisa; Sottini, Alessandra; Dobbs, Kerry; Lisco, Andrea; Sereti, Irini; Su, Helen C.; Notarangelo, Luigi D.; Wang, Xin Wei",medRxiv,436,10

ADEM is considered an autoimmune disorder that is triggered by an environmental stimulus in genetically susceptible individuals. The diagnosis of ADEM is based on clinical and radiological features. Most children with ADEM initially present with fever, meningeal signs, and acute encephalopathy. The level of consciousness ranges from lethargy to frank coma. Deep and subcortical white-matter lesions and gray-matter lesions such as thalami and basal ganglia on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are associated with ADEM. In a child who presents with signs of encephalitis, bacterial and viral meningitis or encephalitis must be ruled out. Sequential MRI is required to confirm the diagnosis of ADEM, as relapses with the appearance of new lesions on MRI may suggest either multiphasic ADEM or multiple sclerosis (MS). Pediatric MS, defined as onset of MS before the age of 16, is being increasingly recognized. MS is characterized by recurrent episodes of demyelination in the CNS separated in space and time. The McDonald criteria for diagnosis of MS include evidence from MRI and allow the clinician to make a diagnosis of clinically definite MS on the basis of the interval preceding the development of new white matter lesions, even in the absence of new clinical findings. The most important alternative diagnosis to MS is ADEM. At the initial presentation, the 2 disorders cannot be distinguished with certainty. Therefore, prolonged follow-up is needed to establish a diagnosis.","Lee, Yun Jin",Korean J Pediatr,436,1

Serological tests can be used diagnostically and for surveillance, but their usefulness depends on their throughput, sensitivity and specificity. Here, we describe a multiplex fluorescent microsphere-based assay, 3Flex, that can detect antibodies to three major SARS-CoV-2 antigens--spike (S) protein, the spike ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (NP). Specificity was assessed using 213 pre-pandemic samples. Sensitivity was measured and compared to the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay using serum samples from 125 unique patients equally binned (n = 25) into 5 time intervals ([â¤]5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, 16 to 20, and [â¥]21 days from symptom onset). With samples obtained at [â¤]5 days from symptom onset, the 3Flex assay was more sensitive (48.0% vs. 32.0%), but the two assays performed comparably using serum obtained [â¥]21 days from symptom onset. A larger collection (n = 534) of discarded sera was profiled from patients (n = 140) whose COVID-19 course was characterized through chart review. This revealed the relative rise, peak (S, 23.8; RBD, 23.6; NP, 16.7; in days from symptom onset), and decline of the antibody response. Considerable interperson variation was observed with a subset of extensively sampled ICU patients. Using soluble ACE2, inhibition of antibody binding was demonstrated for S and RBD, and not for NP.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study comprising of a telephone survey and electronic health records review was performed including all adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs in a large rheumatology tertiary centre in Barcelona, Spain. Demographics, disease activity, COVID-19 related symptoms and contact history data were obtained from the start of the 2020 pandemic. Cumulative incidence of confirmed cases (SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR test) was compared to the population estimates for the same city districts from a governmental COVID-19 health database. Suspected cases were defined following WHO criteria and compared to those without compatible symptoms. RESULTS: 959 patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs were included. We identified 11 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in the adult cohort and no confirmed positive cases in the paediatric cohort. COVID-19 incidence rates of the rheumatic patient cohort were very similar to that of the general population [(0.48% (95% CI 0.09 to 8.65%)] and [0.58% (95% CI 5.62 to 5.99%)], respectively. We found significant differences in tDMARDs proportions between the suspected and non-suspected cases (p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases on tDMARDs do not seem to present a higher risk of COVID-19 or a more severe disease outcome when compared to general population.","Michelena, Xabier; Borrell, Helena; López-Corbeto, Mireia; López-Lasanta, María; Moreno, Estefanía; Pascual-Pastor, María; Erra, Alba; Serrat, Mayte; Espartal, Esther; Antón, Susana; Añez, Gustavo Adolfo; Caparrós-Ruiz, Raquel; Pluma, Andrea; Trallero-Araguás, Ernesto; Barceló-Bru, Mireia; Almirall, Miriam; De Agustín, Juan José; Segura, Jordi Lladós; Julià, Antonio; Marsal, Sara",Semin Arthritis Rheum,436,3

However, safety concerns remain a major problem regarding the use of even highly attenuated viral vectors. Using the rabies virus (RV) envelope protein as a carrier molecule, we show here that inactivated RV particles can be utilized to present Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA) domain-4 in the viral membrane. In addition to the RV glycoprotein (G) transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, a portion of the RV G ectodomain was required to express the chimeric RV G anthrax PA on the cell surface. The novel antigen was also efficiently incorporated into RV virions. Mice immunized with the inactivated recombinant RV virions exhibited seroconversion against both RV G and anthrax PA, and a second inoculation greatly increased these responses. These data demonstrate that a viral envelope protein can carry a bacterial protein and that a viral carrier can display whole polypeptides compared to the limited epitope presentation of previous viral systems.","Smith, Mary Ellen; Koser, Martin; Xiao, Sa; Siler, Catherine; McGettigan, James P.; Calkins, Catherine; Pomerantz, Roger J.; Dietzschold, Bernhard; Schnell, Matthias J.",Virology,436,22

Telbivudine is an orally bioavailable L‐nucleoside with potent and specific anti‐hepatitis B virus activity. The higher rate of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion during telbivudine treatment than other potent anti‐HBV agents suggests a potential immunomodulatory effect. We sought to determine the effects of telbivudine on the immune system, particularly on cytokine production and T‐cell response, using an animal model with mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV‐3)‐induced hepatitis. The effects of telbivudine on virus replication and cytokine production were investigated in vitro using MHV‐3‐infected macrophages, and the effects on T‐cell response were investigated in vivo in an MHV‐3‐induced viral hepatitis model. Telbivudine had no effect on MHV‐3 replication in macrophages. However, the production of tumour necrosis factor‐α and interleukin‐12 was increased significantly in MHV‐3‐induced macrophages treated with telbivudine. In vivo survival was enhanced in telbivudine‐treated mice, with marked normalization in clinical conditions and histological lesions. Serum levels of interferon‐γ were elevated significantly after telbivudine treatment in MHV‐3‐infected C3H mice. In contrast, serum interleukin‐4 levels were decreased significantly. Furthermore, telbivudine treatment enhanced the ability of T cells to undergo proliferation and secrete cytokines but did not affect cytotoxicity of infected hepatocytes. Of note, we found that telbivudine treatment suppressed programmed death ligand 1 expression on T cells. The results demonstrate the immunomodulatory properties of telbivudine, independent of its antiviral activity, in a mouse model of MHV‐3‐induced hepatitis.","Wu, Z. G.; Yan, W.

Several months into the pandemic, the first after-effects of Covid-19 are beginning to be felt by citizens, who are questioning the management carried out so far. In order to improve the performance of governmental decisions to reduce the impact of the pandemic during the coming months, we calculated the levels of efficiency in the management of health resources. In addition, we identify some country characteristics that may condition efficient management. RESULTS: We obtained significant differences according to the geographical location of the country, with European and American countries being less efficient than Asian and African countries. Likewise, we can affirm that greater freedom of expression, a higher median age and an unstable economy and labor market reduce efficiency. However, female leadership of the government and greater compliance with the rule of law offer more efficient management, as do countries that derive more revenues from tourism. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide an opportunity for political leaders to reflect on their management during these months of the pandemic in order to identify mistakes and improve the implementation of effective measures. It has been shown that using more resources does not mean managing better; therefore, policymakers need to pay special attention to the use of resources, taking into account the budgetary constraints of the public sector.","Martínez-Córdoba, Pedro-José; Benito, Bernardino; García-Sánchez, Isabel-María",Global Health,436,24

Our model demonstrates that effective containment of pandemic progression in densely populated cities is achieved only by combining social distancing, widespread testing, and quarantining of infected subjects. This finding has profound epidemiological significance, and sheds light on the controversy regarding the relative effectiveness of widespread testing and social distancing. Our simple epidemiological simulator can also be used to assess the efficacy of a governmental/societal response to an outbreak. This study has also relevant implications on the concept of smart cities; densely populated areas are hot spots highly vulnerable to epidemic crisis.","Alvarez, M.

Il existe de multiples références de filtres respiratoires, que l’on peut classer par leur mécanisme de filtration (filtration mécanique ou électrostatique) et par la présence ou non d’une action humidifiante (filtre échangeur de chaleur et d’humidité hydrophobe, hygroscopique ou mixte). En anesthésie, on privilégie l’utilisation de filtre mécanique simple ; en réanimation on utilise des filtres échangeurs de chaleur et d’humidité ou un filtre simple associé à un humidificateur chauffant. Lors de l’épidémie de coronavirus, la durée d’utilisation des filtres a été allongée afin de limiter le risque de rupture.

Multiple breathing filters references exist which may be classify according to their filtration mechanism (mechanical filtration or electrostatic filtration) and by the eventual presence of a humidifying action (Heat and Moisture Exchangers ; hydrophobic, hygroscopic, or mixed). In anaesthesia, the use of pure mechanical filter is preferred ; in resuscitation unit, heat and moisture exchangers filter or simple filter plus heated humidifier are used.

The objective of this article is to share our experience utilizing the international knowledge transfer program to improve early and late arterial switch operation outcomes in our center. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent the arterial switch operation in Vilnius University Santaros Clinics Cardiothoracic Surgery Center between 1977–2020 was performed. Results: A total of 127 consecutive arterial switch operations were performed in our center. Surgical mortality during the entire study period was 24.6%. Surgical mortality prior to the program, during the program, and after the program was 88.24%, 41.7%, and 5.81%, respectively (p < 0.0001). The surgical mortality of patients operated on during the last 10 years was 4%. The overall survival estimate for the 97 surviving patients was 96.9%, 94.9%, 93.8%, 93.8%, 93.8%, 93.8% at 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively. Risk factors for early mortality included longer aortic cross-clamp time and operation prior to the knowledge transfer program. The only significant risk factor for late reintervention was concomitant aortic arch obstruction treated at the time of the arterial switch. Conclusions: The surgical treatment of transposition of the great arteries by means of an arterial switch with good results can be possible in low-to-medium volume congenital heart surgery centers. International knowledge transfer programs between high-expertise high-volume congenital heart centers and low-to-medium volume congenital heart centers may help to shorten the learning curve and improve early and late outcomes after an arterial switch. The risk factors for surgical mortality and intervention-free survival in low-volume surgical centers are similar to those in high-volume centers. Late arterial switch-related complications are similar to those among different-sized congenital heart centers.","Jonas, Karolis; Jakutis, Virginijus; Sudikienė, Rita; Lebetkevičius, Virgilijus; Baliulis, Giedrius; Tarutis, Virgilijus",Medicina (Kaunas),436,1

These compounds have relevant pharmacological activities, such as: cytotoxicity against human tumor cell lines (especially leukemia), parasites (Plasmodium, Leshmania, and Trypanosoma), retroviruses (e.g., HIV), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Chemoinformatic and toxicoinformatic tools were used here to perform a computational analysis of 70 coumarins and 70 xanthones isolated from this genus in order to explore their potential as new drugs. Most coumarins from this genus possess similar patterns of druglikeness with differences in its physicochemical properties. Xanthones, on the other hand, show quite similar physicochemical properties and druglikeness. It is interesting to note that the vast majority of these compounds (57 coumarins and 59 xanthones) are in compliance with Lipinski´s Rule of Five. Remarkably, two xanthones (2-hydroxyxanthone and caledonixanthone-B) have leadlikeness potential that accordingly with chemoinformatic analysis may target MAO A and B, respectively, and therefore may exhibit antidepressant potential. These compounds also target tyrosine-phosphorilation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) which is over-expressed in a variety of hematological and brain cancers, therefore they could act as anticancer compounds. Several toxicological predictions were also depicted. Coumarins could be an irritant and may affect the reproductive system, while xanthones may have mutagenic results. To our knowledge, this is the first chemoinformatic report on the main active compounds of this genus and its potential for drug development.","Gómez-Verjan, J. C.; Rodríguez-Hernández, K.

Prevalence of post-COVID conditions has been reported among persons who have had COVID-19 (range = 5%-80%), with differences possibly related to different study populations, case definitions, and data sources (1). Few studies of post-COVID conditions have comparisons with the general population of adults with negative test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, limiting ability to assess background symptom prevalence (1). CDC used a nonprobability-based Internet panel established by Porter Novelli Public Services* to administer a survey to a nationwide sample of U.S. adults aged ≥18 years to compare the prevalence of long-term symptoms (those lasting >4 weeks since onset) among persons who self-reported ever receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result with the prevalence of similar symptoms among persons who reported always receiving a negative test result. The weighted prevalence of ever testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was 22.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 20.6%-23.8%). Approximately two thirds of respondents who had received a positive test result experienced long-term symptoms often associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with respondents who received a negative test result, those who received a positive test result reported a significantly higher prevalence of any long-term symptom (65.9% versus 42.9%), fatigue (22.5% versus 12.0%), change in sense of smell or taste (17.3% versus 1.7%), shortness of breath (15.5% versus 5.2%), cough (14.5% versus 4.9%), headache (13.8% versus 9.9%), and persistence (>4 weeks) of at least one initially occurring symptom (76.2% versus 69.6%). Compared with respondents who received a negative test result, a larger proportion of those who received a positive test result reported believing that receiving a COVID-19 vaccine made their long-term symptoms better (28.7% versus 15.7%).

It is comprised of two major structural domains: the RNA binding domain, which interacts with viral and host RNA, and the oligomerization domain which assembles to form the viral core. Here, we investigate the assembly state and RNA binding properties of the full-length nucleocapsid protein using native mass spectrometry. We find that dimers, and not monomers, of full-length N protein bind RNA, implying that dimers are the functional unit of ribonucleoprotein assembly. In addition, we find that N protein binds RNA with a preference for GGG motifs which are known to form short stem loop structures. Unexpectedly, we found that N undergoes proteolytic processing within the linker region, separating the two major domains. This process results in the formation of at least five proteoforms that we sequenced using electron transfer dissociation, higher-energy collision induced dissociation and corroborated by peptide mapping. The cleavage sites identified are in highly conserved regions leading us to consider the potential roles of the resulting proteoforms. We found that monomers of N-terminal proteoforms bind RNA with the same preference for GGG motifs and that the oligomeric state of a C-terminal proteoform (N156-419) is sensitive to pH. We then tested interactions of the proteoforms with the immunophilin cyclophilin A, a key component in coronavirus replication. We found that N1-209 and N1-273 bind directly to cyclophilin A, an interaction that is abolished by the approved immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A. In addition, we found the C-terminal proteoform N156-419 generated the highest antibody response in convalescent plasma from patients >6 months from initial COVID-19 diagnosis when compared to the other proteoforms. Overall, the different interactions of N proteoforms with RNA, cyclophilin A, and human antibodies have implications for viral proliferation and vaccine development.","Lutomski, Corinne A.; El-Baba, Tarick J.; Bolla, Jani R.; Robinson, Carol V.",bioRxiv,436,20

The method avoids the need for extensive purification steps and reduces the concentration of potential inhibitors of RT-qPCR contained in sewage. The concentration method consists of a single step, in which a small volume (40 mL) of sewage sample is incubated with polyaluminum chloride (PAC)(0.00045 N Al(3+) final concentration). Virus particles adsorbed to the precipitate are collected by low-speed centrifugation, after which the recovered pellet is resuspended with a saline buffer. PAC concentrated samples are stable for at least one week at 4 °C. Therefore, they may be sent refrigerated to a diagnosis center for RNA extraction and RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection if the lab does not have such capabilities. The PAC concentration method produced an average shift of 4.5-units in quantification cycle (Cq) values compared to non-concentrated samples, indicating a 25-fold increase in detection sensitivity. The lower detection limit corresponded approximately to 100 viral copies per ml. Kappa index indicated substantial agreement between PAC and polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation protocols (k = 0.688, CI 0.457-0.919).

Emerging literature increasingly supports the premise that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 promotes a prothrombotic milieu. However, to date there have been no reports of acute aortic occlusion, itself a rare phenomenon. We report a case of fatal acute aortic occlusion in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019. CASE REPORT: A 59-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of peripheral vascular disease presented to the emergency department for evaluation of shortness of breath, fevers, and dry cough. His symptoms started 5–7 days prior to the emergency department visit, and he received antibiotics in the outpatient setting without any effect. He was found to be febrile, tachypneic, and hypoxemic. He was placed on supplemental oxygen via a non-rebreather mask. Chest X-ray showed multifocal opacifications. Intravenous antibiotics for possible pneumonia were initiated. Hydroxychloroquine was initiated to cover possible coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. During the hospitalization, the patient became progressively hypoxemic, for which he was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure. D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein were all elevated. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was positive. On day 3, the patient was upgraded to the intensive care unit. Soon after he was intubated, he developed a mottled appearance of skin, which extended from his bilateral feet up to the level of the subumbilical plane. Bedside ultrasound revealed an absence of flow from the mid-aorta to both common iliac arteries. The patient was evaluated emergently by vascular surgery. After a discussion with the family, it was decided to proceed with comfort-directed care, and the patient died later that day. DISCUSSION: Viral infections have been identified as a source of prothrombotic states due to direct injury of vascular tissue and inflammatory cascades. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 appears to follow a similar pattern, with numerous institutions identifying elevated levels of thrombotic complications. We believe that healthcare providers should be aware of both venous and arterial thrombotic complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019, including possible fatal outcome.","Minalyan, Artem; Thelmo, Franklin L.; Chan, Vincent; Tzarnas, Stephanie; Ahmed, Faizan",J Med Case Rep,436,1

Different respiratory etiological agents may induce similar clinical signs that make differential diagnosis difficult. Importantly, AIV brings about severe threat to human public health. Therefore, a novel method that can distinguish these viruses quickly and simultaneously is urgently needed. RESULTS: In this study, an oligonucleotide microarray system was developed. AIV, including H5, H7, and H9 subtypes; NDV; and IBV were simultaneously detected and differentiated on a microarray. Three probes specific for AIV, NDV, and IBV, as well as three other probes for differentiating H5, H7, and H9 of AIV, were first designed and jet-printed to predetermined locations of initiator-integrated poly(dimethylsiloxane) for the synchronous detection of the six pathogens. The marked multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were hybridized with the specific probes, and the results of hybridization were read directly with the naked eyes. No cross-reaction was observed with 10 other subtypes of AIV and infectious bursal disease virus, indicating that the oligonucleotide microarray assay was highly specific. The sensitivity of the method was at least 100 times higher than that of the conventional PCR, and the detection limit of NDV, AIV, H5, H7, and H9 can reach 0.1 EID(50) (50% egg infective dose), except that of IBV, which was 1 EID(50) per reaction. In the validation of 93 field samples, AIV, IBV, and NDV were detected in 53 (56.99%) samples by oligonucleotide microarray and virus isolation and in 50 (53.76%) samples by conventional PCR. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully developed an approach to differentiate AIV, NDV, IBV, H5, H7, and H9 subtypes of AIV using oligonucleotide microarray. The microarray is an accurate, high-throughput, and relatively simple method for the rapid detection of avian respiratory viral diseases. It can be used for the epidemiological surveillance and diagnosis of AIV, IBV, and NDV.

However, there is a lack of evidence on the impact of the pandemic on functional prognosis. The aim of this study is to analyse the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 3-month functional outcomes of patients hospitalised due to acute ischaemic stroke in Aragon (Spain). METHODS: We reviewed the data of all patients admitted due to ischaemic stroke to any hospital in our regional healthcare system between 30 December 2019 and 3 May 2020. We compared modified Rankin Scale scores and mortality at 3 months in patients hospitalised before and after the declaration of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 318 patients with acute ischaemic stroke met our inclusion criteria. No differences were observed between periods in global or specific characteristics, with the exception of a higher proportion of patients older than 80 years during the first period (42.2% vs 29.0%, P = .028). In the comparative analysis, we found no significant differences in mortality (12.3 vs 7.9, P = .465) or in the proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale scores ≤ 2 (57.7% vs 57.1%, P = .425) at 3 months.

SENP1 has a determinative role in the activation of transcription programs in the innate immune responses and the development B of and C lymphocytes. We found, SENP1 possibly plays a critical role in immune infiltration and acts as an expression marker in PAAD, ESCA, and THYM. CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, and macrophages were more key-related immune cells, indicating that SENP1 might be introduced as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy. We further showed that dysregulation of SENP1 is powerfully associated with decreased patient survival and clinical stage. Total SENP1 protein also increases in cancer. SENP1 is also controlled by transcription factors (TFs) CREB1, KDM5A, REST, and YY1 that regulates apoptosis, cell cycle, cell proliferation, invasion, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. These TFs were in a positive correlation with SENP1. MiR-138–5p, miR-129-1-3p, and miR-129-2-3p also inhibit tumorigenesis through targeting of SENP1. The SENP1 expression level positively correlated with the expression levels of UBN1, SP3, SAP130, NUP98, NUP153 in 32 tumor types. SENP1 and correlated and binding genes: SAP130, NUP98, and NUP153 activated cell cycle. Consistent with this finding, drug analysis was indicated SENP1 is sensitive to cell cycle, apoptosis, and RTK signaling regulators. In the end, SENP1 and its expression-correlated and functional binding genes were enriched in cell cycle, apoptosis, cellular response to DNA damage stimulus. We found that the cell cycle is the main way for tumorigenesis by SENP1. SENP1 attenuates the effect of inhibitory drugs on the cell cycle. We also introduced effective FDA-Approved drugs that can inhibit SENP1. Therefore in the treatments in which these drugs are used, SENP1 inhibition is a suitable approach. This study supplies a wide analysis of the SENP1 across The Cancer Genome Atlas (CGA) cancer types. These results suggest the potential roles of SENP1 as a biomarker for cancer. Since these drugs and the drugs that cause to resistance are applied to cancer treatment, then these two class drugs can use to inhibition of SENP1.","Taghvaei, Somayye; Sabouni, Farzaneh; Minuchehr, Zarrin",Front Pharmacol,436,1

For instance, simple epidemic models relying on a small number of parameters can play an important role in characterizing epidemic growth and generating short-term epidemic forecasts. In the absence of reliable information about transmission mechanisms of emerging infectious diseases, phenomenological models are useful to characterize epidemic growth patterns without the need to explicitly model transmission mechanisms and the natural history of the disease.

L’objectif de notre étude était de déterminer la prévalence et les facteurs de risque associés à la survenue d’une embolie pulmonaire (EP) lors du COVID-19. Matériels et méthodes Dans cette étude rétrospective multicentrique, nous avons inclus tous les patients adultes atteints de COVID-19 et chez qui avait été diagnostiqué une EP. Un patient était considéré comme atteint de COVID-19 en cas de PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive. Le diagnostic d’EP était réalisé par angioscanner thoracique ou par l’association concomitante de signes de cœur droit à l’échographie cardiaque transthoracique et une thrombose veineuse profonde chez les malades non transportables. Nous avons réalisé une régression logistique univariée et multivariée pour explorer les facteurs de risque associés à l’EP au cours du COVID-19. Résultats Au total, 486 patients avec une PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive ont été pris en charge dans les hôpitaux de l’étude du 15 mars au 16 avril 2020. Parmi les 196 patients ayant bénéficié d’un angioscanner, 58 (30 %) avaient une EP. Neuf patients présentaient une EP diagnostiqués grâce à l’échographie cardiaque. La prévalence globale des EP était de 67/486 (14 %). Les antécédents médicaux, les comorbidités et les facteurs de risque thromboembolique ne différaient pas entre les patients avec ou sans EP. En analyse multivariée, les facteurs indépendamment associés à la survenue d’une EP chez les patients atteints de COVID-19 étaient les éosinophiles, la protéine C-réactive (CRP), le pH artériel et les D-dimères. Le taux des D-dimères était fortement corrélé avec la survenue d’une EP. Un taux de D-dimères<1μg/mL avait une valeur prédictive négative de 0,9. L’association de D-dimères>3μg/mL et de CRP>90mg/L avait une valeur prédictive positive (PPV) de 0,84. Conclusion L’EP est une complication courante de la COVID-19.

Methods Kidneys from two genetic models of kidney ACE ablation and mice treated with captopril or telmisartan were used to examine ACE2 in isolated kidney and lung membranes. Results In a global ACE KO mice, ACE2 protein abundance in kidney membranes was reduced to 42 % of wild type, p < 0.05. In ACE 8/8 mice that over-expresses cardiac ACE protein but also has no kidney ACE expression, ACE2 protein in kidney membranes was also decreased (38 % of the WT, p<0.01). In kidney membranes from mice that received captopril or telmisartan for 2 weeks there was a reduction in ACE2 protein (37% in captopril treated p<0.01) and 76% in telmisartan treated p <0.05). In lung membranes the expression of ACE2 was very low and not detected by western blotting but no significant differences in terms of ACE2 activity could be detected in mice treated with captopril (118% of control) or telmisartan (93% of control). Conclusions Genetic kidney ACE protein deficiency, suppressed enzymatic activity by Captopril or blockade of the AT1 receptor with telmisartan are all associated with a decrease in ACE2 in kidney membranes. ACE2 protein in kidney or lungs is decreased or unaffected by RAS blockers indicating that these medications can not pose a risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection related to amplification of ACE2 at these two target sites for viral entry.","Wysocki, Jan; Lores, Enrique; Ye, Minghao; Soler, Maria Jose; Batlle, Daniel",bioRxiv,436,1

This global public health threat drew the attention of the medical and scientific community to make the necessary research efforts to combat the spread of the virus. Predictors of preventive behaviors could be of considerable importance relevant to identifying high-risk groups to manage their behavior. We aimed to investigate the association between people's perception of COVID-19 adherence to preventive measures, susceptibility, seriousness, benefits, motivators, barriers, confidence, and information sources. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, enrolling 1,568 participants from WhatsApp groups, aged 16 years and above from March to April 2020 in Saudi Arabia. We prepared an online Arabic self-administered questionnaire, which consisted of (1) sociodemographic characteristics; (2) compliance to preventive measures, including the perception of susceptibility, seriousness, benefits, motivation, barriers to preventive measures, self-confidence; and (3) sources of COVID-19 information. Results Of the 1,568 participants, 60% (n = 1,004) were women, 54.1% (n = 459) were unmarried, and 80.2% (n = 1,258) had earned university degrees. Regarding compliance and perception toward preventive measures, 64% of participants washed hands with soap and water; 50% followed the cough etiquette; 17.5% avoided touching their eyes, nose, and mouth; and 34.6% never shook hands with others. Approximately 52.2%-69.7% avoided going to crowded places and wore facial masks as needed. In addition, 24.3% of people observed social distancing. However, 52.4% did not receive the annual flu vaccine. Approximately 83% used banknotes, 69.8% made online payments, and 51.8% avoided ATM/credit card use. The perception of susceptibility and the seriousness of COVID-19 infection accounted for 8.5% and 50% of participants, respectively. Perceived benefits and motivation reached more than 90%. Barriers for not being able to practice preventive measures were the fear of nasal swabs, forgetfulness, and negligence, which rated 39% and 66%, respectively. Confidence in practicing the preventive measures and distinguishing the symptoms of COVID-19 accounted for 80% and 60% of the participants, respectively. The most used sources to retrieve information were the Ministry of Health (MOH) news and reports and social media, representing 53.5% and 24.6%, respectively. Conclusions During the early phase of the pandemic, people's perception of susceptibility was low, which resulted in a lack of awareness of some citizens to take the COVID-19 infection seriously. Thus, the benefits of preventive measures did not fully translate into practice. The current successful decline of COVID-19 cases should be accompanied by continuing health promotion and disease prevention programs utilizing all avenues and opportunities to remind people of scientific, religious, and cultural practices of handwashing, coughing etiquette. The persistent use of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as facial masks, gloves, and, for frontline workers, shields and protective garments is necessary. Family physicians and teams should play a vital role in this battle.","Alshammari, Abdullah S; Alshammari, Hotoon; Alshammari, Sulaiman",Cureus,436,16

Consequently, Spike protein pseudotyped vectors are a useful tool to study viral entry and its inhibition, with retroviral, lentiviral (LV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vectors the most commonly used systems. Methods to increase the titer of such vectors commonly include concentration by ultracentrifugation and truncation of the Spike protein cytoplasmic tail. However, limited studies have examined whether such a modification also impacts the protein’s function. Here, we optimized concentration methods for SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped VSV vectors, finding that tangential flow filtration produced vectors with more consistent titers than ultracentrifugation. We also examined the impact of Spike tail truncation on transduction of various cell types and sensitivity to convalescent serum neutralization. We found that tail truncation increased Spike incorporation into both LV and VSV vectors and resulted in enhanced titers, but had no impact on sensitivity to convalescent serum inhibition. In addition, we analyzed the effect of the D614G mutation, which became a dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant early in the pandemic. Our studies revealed that, similar to the tail truncation, D614G independently increases Spike incorporation and vector titers, but that this effect is masked by also including the cytoplasmic tail truncation. Therefore, the use of full-length Spike protein, combined with tangential flow filtration, is recommended as a method to generate high titer pseudotyped vectors that retain native Spike protein functions. IMPORTANCE Pseudotyped viral vectors are useful tools to study the properties of viral fusion proteins, especially those from highly pathogenic viruses. The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been investigated using pseudotyped lentiviral and VSV vector systems, where truncation of its cytoplasmic tail is commonly used to enhance Spike incorporation into vectors and to increase the titers of the resulting vectors. However, our studies have shown that such effects can also mask the phenotype of the D614G mutation in the ectodomain of the protein, which was a dominant variant early in the COVID-19 pandemic. To better ensure the authenticity of Spike protein phenotypes when using pseudotyped vectors, we therefore recommend using full-length Spike proteins, combined with tangential flow filtration methods of concentration, if higher titer vectors are required.","Chen, Hsu-Yu; Huang, Chun; Tian, Lu; Huang, Xiaoli; Zhang, Chennan; Llewellyn, George N.; Rogers, Geoffrey L.; Andresen, Kevin; O’Gorman, Maurice R.G.; Chen, Ya-Wen; Cannon, Paula M.",bioRxiv,436,24

We studied the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among armed forces doctors in India during the COVID-19 pandemic and the factors that contribute to these symptoms. METHODS: The study was conducted from March 30, 2020, to April 2, 2020, using a self-administered questionnaire questionnaire using the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), which was sent through Google Forms. Responses were received from 769 respondents. Data were analyzed for demographic details and HADS scores using the chi-square test and backward logistic regression. RESULTS: Anxiety and depressive symptoms were seen in 35.2% and 28.2% of the doctors, respectively. In doctors with anxiety symptoms, significant associations were observed with age (20–35 years, 39.4%, P = 0.01), gender (females, 44.6%, P < 0.001), duration of service (0–10 years, 38%, P = 0.03), and clinical versus non-clinical specialties (non-clinical, 41.3%, P < 0.001) as opposed to marital status, education level, and current department of work. In doctors with depressive symptoms, significant associations were observed with age (P = 0.04), clinical versus non-clinical specialties (P < 0.001), duration of service (0–10 years, 30.1%, P = 0.03), and doctoral degree (P = 0.04) as opposed to gender, marital status, education level, and current working department. CONCLUSION: The study revealed a high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among armed forces doctors. The main contributing factors are female gender, young age group, non-clinical specialties, and having a doctoral degree.","Gupta, Simmi; Kohli, Kinshuk; Padmakumari, P; Dixit, Prashant Kumar; Prasad, Ajay Shankar; Chakravarthy, Bharath Seshadri; Shukla, Rajat; Ghana, Parthasarathi; Mahapatra, Debasish; Varadaraj, G",Indian J Psychol Med,436,3

Design: Retrospective manual medical record review. Setting: NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP/CUIMC), a quaternary care academic medical center in NYC. Participants: The first 1000 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Methods: We identified patients with a positive RT-SARS-CoV-2 PCR receiving care at NYP/CUIMC from March 1 through April 15. Patient data was manually abstracted from the electronic medical record. Main outcome measures: We describe patient characteristics including demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities on presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, outcomes, and disposition. Results: Among the first 1000 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 151 patients were discharged from or died in the ED, 618 were admitted to the floor, and 231 were admitted or transferred to the ICU; 195 remained hospitalized and 172 had died in the hospital. The most common presenting symptoms were cough (73.2%), fever (72.8%), and dyspnea (62.9%). Compared to Chinese and Italian cohorts, hospitalized patients and ICU patients in particular had more baseline comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity and higher rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) and dialysis. ICU patients were older and predominantly male (67.5%); 75.3% developed AKI and 31.2% required dialysis. Notably, of patients who required mechanical ventilation, only 5.9% were first intubated more than 14 days after symptom onset. Time to intubation from symptom onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at 3-4 and 9 days. Conclusions: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness at this medical center faced significant morbidity and mortality, with high rates of AKI, dialysis, and a bimodal distribution in time to intubation from symptom onset.

Recently, early clinical data reported the feasibility of low doses of radiation therapy (RT) in the treatment of ARDS in patients with severe COVID-19. However, the involved mechanisms remained unknown. Methods and materials here, we used airways-instilled lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and influenza virus (H1N1) as murine models of pneumonia, and Toll- like receptor (TLR)-3 stimulation in human lung macrophages. Results low doses RT (0.5-1Gy) decreased LPS induced pneumonia, and increased the percentage of Nerve- and Airway- associated Macrophages (NAMs) producing IL-10. During H1N1 viral infection, we observed decreased lung tissue damage and immune cell infiltration in irradiated animals. Low doses RT increased IL-10 production by infiltrating immune cells into the lung. Irradiation of TLR-3 ligand-stimulated human lung macrophages ex vivo increased IL-10 secretion and decreased IFNγ production in the culture supernatant. The percentage of human lung macrophages producing IL-6 was also decreased. Conclusion our data highlight one of the mechanisms by which low doses RT regulate lung inflammation and skew lung macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory profile. These data provide a preclinical mechanistic support to clinical trials evaluating low doses RT, as for COVID-19-induced ARDS.","Meziani, Lydia; Robert, Charlotte; Classe, Marion; Da Costa, Bruno; Mondini, Michele; Clémenson, Céline; Alfaro, Alexia; Mordant, Pierre; Ammari, Samy; Goffic, Ronan Le; Deutsch, Eric",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,436,16

Clinicians and decision‐makers need a summary of the most recent evidence. This scoping review maps the evidence on the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of remdesivir for patients with COVID‐19, up to 14 September 2020. METHODS: Our scoping review searched Pubmed, Embase (Ovid), Scopus and 17 primary trial registries for empirical publications or active registered clinical trials for data on the efficacy, effectiveness, or safety of remdesivir for COVID‐19 or SARS‐CoV‐2. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the included publications. RESULTS: Seventeen empirical studies and 23 clinical trial registrations (n = 40) accumulated 46 508 participants. We found 4 published randomized–controlled trials accumulating 2293 patients. Two trials reported shorter median recovery time and better clinical status among patients who received remdesivir compared with the control groups. Observational studies report an association between remdesivir treatment and decreased mortality, as well as increased survival. The most common adverse reaction was hepatic impairment, although the trials reported a similar proportion of adverse events in the intervention and control groups. CONCLUSION: Remdesivir might shorten the time to clinical improvement among hospitalized adults with severe COVID‐19. Trial data report a similar proportion of adverse events in treated and control groups. The results of the 23 registered active trials, including more than 30 000 participants, will shed light on the efficacy and safety of the antiviral. The findings of the remaining clinical trials expected to report results in 2020 will allow a quantitative synthesis of available evidence.","Pimentel, Juan; Laurie, Cassandra; Cockcroft, Anne; Andersson, Neil",Br J Clin Pharmacol,436,1

US is taught through a combination of self-directed learning, didactic lectures, and “in-person” training sessions. “Hands-on” formal instruction is thought to be a vital component of US skill acquisition. However, during a pandemic and social distancing practices, “in-person” ultrasound training sessions are not possible. Display of ultrasound machine image and probe positioning can be shared in real time through virtual platforms, which allows for direct instructor education and feedback. This virtual method of US teaching may be complementary to traditional US teaching methods in the future. ABSTRACT: “Hands-on” teaching is an important part of sports ultrasound (US) education in sports medicine fellowships. However, physical distancing requirements during a global pandemic have resulted in cancellation and/or postponement of “in-person” educational sessions, US conferences, and clinical diagnostic and interventional US cases that enhance US training. In order for “hands-on” sports US teaching to continue during these uncertain times, the educational model must be adapted. The use of virtual meeting platforms to display US images is possible, and this not only allows for instructor demonstration, but also gives the instructor an opportunity to observe the learner scanning and provide direct feedback in real-time. Moving forward, virtual US teaching methods will likely continue to be of educational value, as they provide increased access to individualized instruction from skilled instructors and eliminate travel time and cost of conferences and instructional sessions.","Schroeder, Allison N.; Hall, Mederic M.; Kruse, Ryan C.",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,436,17

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled patients aged ≥ 65 years with facial NMSC, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 40 and life expectancy ≥ 6 months, amenable neither to daily RT nor surgery. Radiotherapy consisted of 35 Gy, delivered with 6 MeV electron beam, in 5 fractions of 7 Gy/day twice a week (tw). Prescription isodoses were 100% for cT1–cT2 and 90% for cT3–cT4. Objective response was assessed clinically 4 and 8 weeks after the end of RT and then monitored every 6 months. Side effects were assessed according to the CTCAE scale. RESULTS: 12 patients of median age 89.5 years with a total of 23 NMSC cN0 achieved a median follow-up time of 6 months (range 1–10), with total treatment compliance. 10/12 patients had a 40 ≤ KPS < 70 and 2/12 a 70 ≤ KPS < 90. 5/12 patients had synchronous lesions. 22/23 lesions were classified as T1–T2 and had complete response (CR), 1/23 as T4 with partial response (PR). Within 4 weeks after the end of treatment, G1 toxicity was reported for 12/23 lesions, G2 for 8/23, G3 for 3/23, G4 for 0/23, all disappeared 8 weeks later, with or without topical therapy. After last follow-up (1 June 2020) 1/12 patients died with PR from senile marasmus, 11/12 are alive with CR and widely tolerated toxicities.

In this study, we propose a Susceptible-Asymptomatic-Infectious deterministic model to evaluate the impact of compulsory containment imposed in Morocco on March, 21 on the spread of COVID-19 epidemic across the country. The model takes account of the unconfined individuals that continue to work or to leave their home for urgent needs and the existence of infectious asymptomatic and unreported individuals within susceptible population. Furthermore, the model is able to predict the peak-size, peak-time, final size and epidemic duration according to different rates of containment. Advanced knowledge of these details will be of great interest to establish an optimal plan-of-action to control or eradicate the epidemic. Indeed, mitigating and delaying the epidemic peak allow the official health authorities to anticipate and control the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, prediction of the epidemic duration can help the government to predict the end time of containment to avoid consequent social-economic damages as well. Using our model, the basic reproduction number R(0) is estimated to be 2.9949, with [Formula: see text] reflecting a high speed of spread of the epidemic. The model shows that the compulsory containment can be efficient if more than 73% of population are confined. In the absence of other efficient measure of control, even with 90% of containment, the end-time is estimated to happen on July, 4,2020 with 7558 final cumulative cases. Furthermore, a threshold value of containment rate, below which the epidemic duration is postponed, has been determined. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is performed and showed that the COVID-19 dynamics strongly depends on the asymptomatic duration as well as the contact and containment rates. Our previsions can help the government to adjust its plan-of-action to fight the disease and to face the social-economic shock induced by the containment.","Hammoumi, Aayah; Qesmi, Redouane",Chaos Solitons Fractals,436,18

DESIGN: Observational cohort study involving retrospective analysis of demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data. SETTING: Adult intensive care unit in a tertiary referral university hospital involved in a major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). PATIENTS: The first 54 patients admitted with SARS to an intensive care unit (ICU). All were treated with corticosteroids, ribavirin, broad spectrum antimicrobials and supportive therapy. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: All patients were admitted for respiratory failure. The median APACHE II score was 11 (interquartile range 8–13). At 28 days 34 patients (63%; 95% CI 49.6–74.6) were alive and not mechanically ventilated. Six patients were alive but ventilated (11.3%; 95% confidence interval 5.3–22.6) and 14 had died (25.9%; CI 16.1–38.9). Seven of 27 ventilated patients developed evidence of barotrauma (25.9%; 95% CI 13.2–44.7). Median maximal multiple-organ dysfunction score was 5 (interquartile range 3.3–9). Median maximal respiratory dysfunction score was 3 (interquartile range 3–4). Increased age, severity of illness, lymphocyte count, decreased steroid dose, positive fluid balance, chronic disease or immunosuppression and nosocomial sepsis were associated with poor outcome on univariate analysis. Poor outcome was defined as death or need for mechanical ventilation at 28 days after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality amongst critically ill patients with SARS is high. It causes predominantly severe respiratory failure, with little other organ failure, and a high incidence of barotrauma amongst those requiring mechanical ventilation.

Mathematical models have been useful in understanding various aspects of the HCV epidemic, and especially, the importance of new treatment measures. Until now, however, few models have attempted to understand HCV in terms of an interaction between the various actors in an HCV outbreak—hosts, viruses and the needle injection equipment. In this study, we apply perspectives from the ecology of infectious diseases to model the transmission of HCV among a population of injection drug users. The products of our model suggest that modelling HCV as an indirectly transmitted infection—where the injection equipment serves as an environmental reservoir for infection—facilitates a more nuanced understanding of disease dynamics, by animating the underappreciated actors and interactions that frame disease. This lens may allow us to understand how certain public health interventions (e.g. needle exchange programmes) influence HCV epidemics. Lastly, we argue that this model is of particular importance in the light of the modern opioid epidemic, which has already been associated with outbreaks of viral diseases.","Miller-Dickson, Miles D.; Meszaros, Victor A.; Almagro-Moreno, Salvador; Brandon Ogbunugafor, C.",J R Soc Interface,436,20

Of the RCTs evaluated 69% (55/77) were considered by the WHO group to include patients with a range of severities (12 mild-moderate; 3 mild-severe; 18 mild-critical; 5 moderate-severe; 8 moderate-critical; 10 severe-critical), but the distribution of disease severities within these groups usually could not be determined, and data on the duration of illness and/or oxygen saturation values were often missing. Where severity classifications were clear there was substantial overlap in mortality across trials in different severity strata. This imprecision in severity assessment compromises the validity of some therapeutic recommendations; notably extrapolation of ""lack of therapeutic benefit"" shown in hospitalised severely ill patients on respiratory support to ambulant mildly ill patients is not warranted. Both harmonised unambiguous definitions of severity and individual patient data meta-analyses are needed to guide and improve therapeutic recommendations in COVID-19.","Guerin, P. J.; McLean, A. R.

However, it is labor intensive and costly to carry it out. Some countries have faced challenges implementing contact tracing, and no impact evaluations to our knowledge have assessed its impact on COVID-19 mortality. This study assesses the impact of contact tracing in a middle-income country and provides data to support the expansion of contact tracing strategies with the aim of improving infection control. Methods We obtained publicly available data on all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Colombia between March 2 and June 16, 2020. (N=54,931 cases over 135 days of observation). We proxied contact tracing performance as the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing out of all cases identified, as suggested by WHO guidelines. We calculated the daily proportion of cases identified through contact tracing across 37 geographical units (32 departments and five districts). Further, we used a sequential log-log fixed-effects model to estimate the 21-days, 28-days, 42-days and 56-days lagged impact of the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths. Both the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing and the daily number of COVID-19 deaths are smoothed using 7-day moving averages. Models control for prevalence of active cases, second-degree polynomials, and mobility indices. Robustness checks to include supply-side variables were performed. Results We found that a 10 percent increase in the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing is related to COVID-19 mortality reductions between 0.8% and 3.4%. Our models explain between 47%-70% of the variance in mortality. Results are robust to changes of specification and inclusion of supply-side variables. Conclusion Contact tracing is instrumental to contain infectious diseases and its prioritization as a surveillance strategy will have a substantial impact on reducing deaths while minimizing the impact on the fragile economic systems of lower and middle-income countries. This study provides lessons for other LMIC.","Vecino-Ortiz, A. I.; Villanueva Congote, J.; Zapata Bedoya, S.; Cucunuba, Z. M.",,436,24

In this work, an alternative full-face mask is adapted from a modified snorkel mask to be used as PPE with two medical-grade filters and a 3D-printed adapter. Since the mask covers the eyes, mouth, and nose, it acts as a full-face shield, providing additional protection to healthcare workers. The SARS-CoV-2 has a size between 60 nm and 140 nm, and airborne viral particles can be carried by larger droplets with sizes up to several millimeters. The minimum filtration efficiency of mechanical and electrostatic filters is usually reached between 30 nm and 300 nm. The filtration efficiency of different medical filters is measured for particles below 300 nm to cover the size of the SARS-CoV-2 and small virus-laden droplets, and determine the minimum efficiency. The filtration performance of the adapted full-face mask is characterized using NaCl particles below 500 nm and different fitting scenarios to determine the minimum protection efficiency. The mask is compared to a commercial respirator and characterized according to the EN 149 standard, demonstrating that the protection fulfills the requirements for the FFP2 level (filtering face-piece 2, stopping at least 94% of airborne particles). The device shows a good resistance to several cycles of decontamination (autoclaving and ethanol immersion), is easy to be produced locally at low cost, and helps to address the shortage in FFP2 masks and face shields by providing adequate protection to healthcare workers against particles <500 nm in size.","Schmitt, Jean; Jones, Lewis S.; Aeby, Elise A.; Gloor, Christian; Moser, Berthold; Wang, Jing",Chem Res Toxicol,436,24

As part of an effort to reduce the consequences of this outbreak on health service delivery to stroke patients, the European Stroke Organisation has undertaken a survey aimed at collecting information on the provision of stroke care during the pandemic. METHODS: Cross-sectional, web-based survey, conducted from 26 March through 1 April 2020 among stroke care providers, focused on reorganisation of health services, the delivery of acute and post-acute stroke care and the availability of personal protective equipment. RESULTS: A total of 426 stroke care providers from 55 countries completed the survey, most of whom worked in Europe (n = 375, 88%) and were stroke physicians/neurologists (n = 334, 78%). Among European respondents, 289 (77%) reported that not all stroke patients were receiving the usual care in their centres and 266 (71%) estimated that functional outcomes and recurrence rates of stroke patients would be negatively affected by the organisational changes caused by the pandemic. The areas considered as being most affected were acute care and rehabilitation. Most professionals had to adapt their activities and schedules and more than half reported shortage of protective equipment. DISCUSSION: Strategies to maintain availability of stroke care during the COVID-19 outbreak are crucial to prevent indirect mortality and disability due to suboptimal care. CONCLUSION: European Stroke Organisation proposes a set of targeted actions for decision makers facing this exceptional situation.","Aguiar de Sousa, Diana; van der Worp, H Bart; Caso, Valeria; Cordonnier, Charlotte; Strbian, Daniel; Ntaios, George; Schellinger, Peter D; Sandset, Else Charlotte",Eur Stroke J,436,17
