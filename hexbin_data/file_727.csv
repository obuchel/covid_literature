At present, limited data are available on the risk, racial disparity, and outcomes for COVID-19 illness in patients with cancer. Objectives: To investigate how patients with specific types of cancer are at risk for COVID-19 infection and its adverse outcomes and whether there are cancer-specific race disparities for COVID-19 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective case-control analysis of patient electronic health records included 73.4 million patients from 360 hospitals and 317â¯000 clinicians across 50 US states to August 14, 2020. The odds of COVID-19 infections for 13 common cancer types and adverse outcomes were assessed. Exposures: The exposure groups were patients diagnosed with a specific cancer, whereas the unexposed groups were patients without the specific cancer. Main Outcomes and Measures: The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% CI were estimated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for the risk of COVID-19 infection. Results: Among the 73.4 million patients included in the analysis (53.6% female), 2â¯523â¯920 had at least 1 of the 13 common cancers diagnosed (all cancer diagnosed within or before the last year), and 273â¯140 had recent cancer (cancer diagnosed within the last year). Among 16â¯570 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 1200 had a cancer diagnosis and 690 had a recent cancer diagnosis of at least 1 of the 13 common cancers. Those with recent cancer diagnosis were at significantly increased risk for COVID-19 infection (aOR, 7.14 [95% CI, 6.91-7.39]; P < .001), with the strongest association for recently diagnosed leukemia (aOR, 12.16 [95% CI, 11.03-13.40]; P < .001), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aOR, 8.54 [95% CI, 7.80-9.36]; P < .001), and lung cancer (aOR, 7.66 [95% CI, 7.07-8.29]; P < .001) and weakest for thyroid cancer (aOR, 3.10 [95% CI, 2.47-3.87]; P < .001). Among patients with recent cancer diagnosis, African Americans had a significantly higher risk for COVID-19 infection than White patients; this racial disparity was largest for breast cancer (aOR, 5.44 [95% CI, 4.69-6.31]; P < .001), followed by prostate cancer (aOR, 5.10 [95% CI, 4.34-5.98]; P < .001), colorectal cancer (aOR, 3.30 [95% CI, 2.55-4.26]; P < .001), and lung cancer (aOR, 2.53 [95% CI, 2.10-3.06]; P < .001). Patients with cancer and COVID-19 had significantly worse outcomes (hospitalization, 47.46%; death, 14.93%) than patients with COVID-19 without cancer (hospitalization, 24.26%; death, 5.26%) (P < .001) and patients with cancer without COVID-19 (hospitalization, 12.39%; death, 4.03%) (P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this case-control study, patients with cancer were at significantly increased risk for COVID-19 infection and worse outcomes, which was further exacerbated among African Americans. These findings highlight the need to protect and monitor patients with cancer as part of the strategy to control the pandemic.","Wang, QuanQiu; Berger, Nathan A; Xu, Rong",JAMA oncol. (Online),,727
633114,Editorial Commentary: Critical Contribution of Laboratories to Outbreak Response Support for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,2015-02-01,"Large-scale re-engineering of synonymous sites is a promising strategy to generate attenuated viruses for vaccines. Attenuation typically relies on de-optimisation of codon pairs and maximization of CpG dinculeotide frequencies. So as to formulate evolutionarily-informed attenuation strategies, that aim to force nucleotide usage against the estimated direction favoured by selection, here we examine available whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 to infer patterns of mutation and selection on synonymous sites. Analysis of mutational profiles indicates a strong mutation bias towards T with concomitant selection against T. Accounting for dinucleotide effects reinforces this conclusion, observed TT content being a quarter of that expected under neutrality. A significantly different mutational profile at CDS sites that are not 4-fold degenerate is consistent with contemporaneous selection against T mutations more widely. Although selection against CpG dinucleotides is expected to drive synonymous site G+C content below mutational equilibrium, observed G+C content is slightly above equilibrium, possibly because of selection for higher expression. Consistent with gene-specific selection against CpG dinucleotides, we observe systematic differences of CpG content between SARS-CoV2 genes. We propose an evolutionarily informed gene-bespoke approach to attenuation that, unusually, seeks to increase usage of the already most common synonymous codons. Comparable analysis of H1N1 and Ebola finds that GC3 deviated from neutral equilibrium is not a universal feature, cautioning against generalization of results.","Rice, Alan M.; Morales, Atahualpa Castillo; Ho, Alexander T.; Mordstein, Christine; Mühlhausen, Stefanie; Watson, Samir; Cano, Laura; Young, Bethan; Kudla, Grzegorz; Hurst, Laurence D.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.088112,727
