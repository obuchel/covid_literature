18893,A system dynamics approach for understanding community resilience to disaster risk,2021-06-14,"This article will address the disaster resilience village (DRV) approach as a disaster preparedness method in Indonesia. This scheme became operational in 2012, exactly 5 years after disaster management legislation was passed in 2007. This DRV strategy is a component of the central government’s decentralisation of disaster management to local governments. Using a method of doctrinal legal review, this study argues that the DRV approach to disaster preparedness at the village level is inefficient. That is because the village apparatus is the central player in this DRV, but residents of disaster-prone areas are regarded as an afterthought when it comes to disaster management. Consequently, efforts to strengthen emergency preparedness for residents in disaster-prone areas will be harmed. As a result, it is unsurprising that whenever a disaster occurs in Indonesia, the death toll and damage to property remain high. This is because people who live in disaster-prone areas lack a framework for transforming knowledge and scientific experience with disasters. In addition, this DRV strategy opposes previous disaster experts’ community-based and transformative approaches. However, direct field research on communities living in disaster-prone areas is needed to obtain empirical evidence of the DRV approach’s shortcomings.","Arifin, Saru; Wicaksono, Sonny S.; Sumarto, Slamet; Martitah, Martitah; Sulistianingsih, Dewi",Jamba,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8252171/,697

Enterprise supply chain (SC) is an important way for enterprises to conduct business with other strategic partners in the market, and the improvement of SC performance is an important way to improve the core competitiveness of enterprises, so it is of great value to study the performance evaluation and index design of the enterprise SC. This method calculates the level value of the overall performance of the SC. This level value is a value between 0 and 1. The higher the value, the higher the overall performance level of the SC. Therefore, when evaluating the overall performance of the SC, appropriate index weights must be selected according to the characteristics of the industry, which helps to objectively evaluate the overall performance of the SC.","Bu, Miaoling",Comput Intell Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8423561/,697

There are many reasons, which have to be considered as supporting factors for the spread of infectious diseases, such as the open borders of the European Union, allowing rather free movement of animals over a whole continent, the globalization, the released and accelerated international and national trade and animal transfer. Simultaneously, the emergence and re-emergence of new or already known pathogens is a various serious issue in veterinary and in human medicine. This scenario is clearly illustrated by the regular occurrence of transboundary animal diseases (TADs), such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), classical swine fever (CSF), African swine fever (ASF), among others. The recent occurrence of African swine fever in the Caucasus region and the spread afterwards to large territories of Russia clearly illustrates that our health authorities require a very strong preparedness, including prompt and powerful diagnosis, for the successful fight against the novel scenarios.","Belák, Sándor; Liu, Lihong",Advanced Techniques in Diagnostic Microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120236/,697

They are predictable to some degree by weather forecasting but to a greater degree and with more accuracy when drainage basin monitoring equipment is in place. This includes stream gauges that telemeter the elevation of stream/river surface in a channel and the rate of water flow to a central computing station. The computed data from the telemetered sites plus the input of stream/river channel cross-sections data allow prediction of where flooding will be a problem, when the flooding will reach an area, and to what level out of a channel (magnitude) the flood is estimated to reach. This gives the populations at risk of the flooding early warnings (hours, days) and time to prepare for the floodwaters or to gather important documents and evacuate to safe higher ground.","Siegel, Frederic R.",Mitigation of Dangers from Natural and Anthropogenic Hazards,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120445/,697

Without major investments, the effort has been to integrate existing resources, to implement tight links among national and supranational agencies and to make plans for their most efficient involvement in case of need. The mainstay for the response to a biological attack is represented by the public health system, entrusted to Italy’s national health service, centrally coordinated but put into action by the Regions.

Advances in all aspects of care, from the role of multidisciplinary intestinal rehabilitation services prior to transplant to the development strategies for early recognition of infectious sequelae and even the increasing availability of preventive strategies, have led to improved outcomes and a dramatic decline in infection-associated morbidity and mortality in children undergoing intestinal transplantation. Improvements in surgical techniques and immunosuppressive regimens have been essential components in these improvements, reducing risk of infection through reduction of technical complications and more optimal immunosuppression regimens. In addition, the development of molecular tools for early recognition of viral pathogens and an understanding of the timing and risks for infection have allowed for earlier and more successful treatments. Despite these improvements, infectious sequelae remain an important problem in this population, and additional efforts are needed to further minimize the risk of infectious sequelae in those children requiring this procedure.","Soltys, Kyle A.; Reyes, Jorge D.; Green, Michael",Transplant Infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123248/,697

31746,Education in and After Covid-19: Immediate Responses and Long-Term Visions,2020-04-26,"Myocardial dysfunction is a frequent organ manifestation during septic shock and the subsequent impairment in cardiac output may result in organ hypoperfusion, requiring prompt and adequate treatment to restore cardiovascular function and reverse shock [1]. Current sepsis guidelines recommend resuscitation with intravascular fluid administration in association with inotropes and vasopressors to maintain organ perfusion [2]. Dobutamine is recommended as first-line inotropic agent and should be administered when low cardiac output or signs of hypoperfusion persist after adequate fluid resuscitation and perfusion pressure have been achieved [2]. However, the efficacy of dobutamine in patients with heart failure has not been fully demonstrated and concerns on its use are still present [3]. Although dobutamine improves perfusion and increases oxygen delivery (DO(2)), its impact on survival in septic shock patients is limited, with guideline recommendations based mainly on the landmark study by Rivers et al. [4]. Recently, Wilkman et al. [5] reported that the use of inotropes, particularly dobutamine, in septic shock was associated with increased 90-day mortality. In explaining the lack of outcome benefit [3, 5], several aspects need to be taken into account. First, the need of inotropic support may simply represent an expression of disease severity rather than the cause of a poor outcome. Second, whereas the treatment of impaired cardiac output should be tailored based on the etiological mechanism of the cardiovascular dysfunction, the current guidelines recommend the use of inotropes without differentiating the underlying causes of impaired left ventricular (LV) stroke volume [2, 6]. In addition, the majority of cardiovascular monitoring instruments provide data almost exclusively on cardiac output and pressures. This approach may potentially increase the number of patients who may be harmed by inotrope administration (Fig. 1). Finally, the beneficial short-term effect of enhanced contractility by cAMP-increasing drugs (e. g., dobutamine, milrinone) is, at least partly, abolished by the increased energy consumption, the worsening of ventricular relaxation and the direct cardiomyocyte toxicity [1, 7–10].","Morelli, A.; Passariello, M.; Singer, M.",Annual Update in Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine 2014,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176156/,697

Just as statistical tools have become indispensable in epidemiological investigations and interpretations of epidemiologic data, molecular biology tools today have come to elucidate epidemiologic features of diseases that cannot be easily characterized by conventional techniques. Applied to infectious diseases, molecular biology methods have also come to challenge our traditional notions about the epidemiology of these diseases and have engendered novel opportunities for their prevention and control.

32056,Against All Odds: Education in Germany Coping with Covid-19,2020-05-04,"COVID-19 has given us a food for thought that whether we are prepared for such pandemics or not. Developed nations may say that they have enough resources to tackle such situations, but when it comes to the physical and emotional security of the children, even they have to think manifolds because preparing children for such pandemics need lot of effort and apt planning. The purpose of this chapter is to reflect issues related to children during any infectious disease outbreak like COVID-19. Adults are mature enough to control their emotions and can act patiently, but immature minds are always perplexed and act in a very clingy way when some adverse situation is thrown to them. Children are ardent observers and act according to the reactions of the folks around them. It is difficult for them to conceal their behavior, and it is difficult for parents as well to manage their anxiety levels. During crisis period when social distancing and refrained outdoor activities have brought our children into a knotty situation, it is necessary that we understand their fears and myths, try to resolve their concerns in a polite way and strengthen their minds. At this stage the role of parents, teachers, educational institutes, social media, and international children’s organizations need to be redefined. The importance of the decisions taken by the governing bodies should be explained to the children in an effective way, so that they do not panic and reflect a brave attitude. UNICEF in collaboration with international health support systems and departments has a major role to play. Appropriate planning for preparing the children for pandemics has to be incorporated in our system, so that any future crisis can be dealt in an easier way. Schools colleges and other educational institutes should execute immunization and hygiene and health practices in advance to promote prevention.","Saxena, Rakhi; Saxena, Shailendra K.",Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189392/,697
32336,Reflections on leadership in the time of COVID-19,2020-04-07,"Learning efficient representation of graphs has recently been studied extensively for simple networks to facilitate various downstream applications. In this paper, we deal with a more generalized graph structure, called multigraph (multiple edges of different types connecting a pair of nodes) and propose Multigraph2Vec, a random walk based framework for learning multigraph network representation. Multigraph2Vec samples a heterogeneous neighborhood structure for each node by preserving the inter-layer interactions. It employs Lévy flight random walk strategy, which allows the random walker to travel across multiple layers and reach far-off nodes in a single step. The transition probabilities are learned in a supervised fashion as a function of node attributes (metadata based and/or network structure based). We compare Multigraph2Vec with four state-of-the-art baselines after suitably adopting to our setting on four datasets. Multigraph2Vec outperforms others in the task of link prediction, by beating the best baseline with 5.977% higher AUC score; while in the multi-class node classification task, it beats the best baseline with 5.28% higher accuracy. We also deployed Multigraph2Vec for friend recommendation on Hike Messenger.","Roy, Aman; Kumar, Vinayak; Mukherjee, Debdoot; Chakraborty, Tanmoy",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206153/,697
32363,The easy weaponization of social media: why profit has trumped security for U.S. companies,2020-05-11,"As taxis are primary public transport in metropolises, accurately predicting fine-grained taxi demands of passengers in real time is important for guiding drivers to plan their routes and reducing the waiting time of passengers. Many efforts have been paid to provide accurate taxi demand prediction, and deep neural networks are leveraged recently. However, existing works are limited in properly incorporating multi-view taxi demand predictions together, by simply assigning fixed weights learned by training to the predictions of each region. To solve this problem, we apply the attention mechanism for leveraging contextual information to assist prediction, and a context-aware attention-based convolutional recurrent neural network (CACRNN) is proposed. Specially, we forecast fine-grained taxi demands with considering multi-view features, including spatial correlations among adjacent regions, short-term periodicity, long-term periodicity, and impacts of external factors. Local convolutional (LC) layers and gated recurrent units (GRUs) are utilized to extract the features from historical records. Moreover, a context-aware attention module is employed to incorporate the predictions of each region with considering different features, which is our novel attempt. This module assigns different weights to the predictions of a region according to its contextual information such as weather, index of time slots, and region function. We conduct comprehensive experiments based on a large-scale real-world dataset from New York City, and the results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.","Wu, Wenbin; Liu, Tong; Yang, Jiahao",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206181/,697

33693,Distance e-learning is closer than everybody thought: A Pharmacy Education Perspective,2020-06-04,"BACKGROUND: Caffeine is a common treatment for neonatal intensive care management of the developmental complication of apnea of prematurity in preterm infants. There are several systematic reviews (SRs) on the performance of caffeine in the treatment of apnea. The evidence provided by those, however, is depressed by an information overload due to high heterogeneity in the characteristics as well as the quality of these SRs. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to provide a systematic overview of SRs on the use of caffeine for the management of neonatal apnea. Such overviews are a recent method used to assess and filter top evidence among SRs, enabling enhanced access to targeted information of interest. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted via EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and PubMed since inception to January 2020. Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction, and assessed the quality of methods and the risk of bias in included SRs based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) and Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tools. Extracted data related to study type, characteristics, patients, intervention, comparator, regimen, and outcome measures. RESULTS: Seven SRs with meta-analyses (SRMAs) were included in the current overview, involving a total of 63,315 neonates. SRMAs included randomized clinical and observational studies, with various types of patients, comparators, and outcomes. The quality of SRMAs ranged from critically low (n = 1), low (n = 1), moderate (n = 2), to high (n = 3), and the risk of bias was unclear (n = 2), low (n = 4), and high (n = 1). The effectiveness of caffeine with regard to treatment success and the rate of apnea was not significantly different from that of theophylline or doxapram in two SRMAs. Against control, in one SRMA, while caffeine reduced the rate of failure as well as the need for pressure ventilation, it did not significantly reduce mortality. This comparative effectiveness of caffeine was based on high-quality SRMAs with a low risk of bias. The effectiveness against apnea seems to be enhanced via the administration of early (0–2 days) or high doses of caffeine in one and three SRMAs, respectively. This, nevertheless, was based on lower-quality SRMAs with a higher risk of bias. Safety outcomes were mostly based on comparative SRMAs of different drug regimens, whereby, less tachycardia and lower risk for complications were reported with lower and earlier caffeine administrations, respectively. The evidence behind this, however, was limited in quantity and quality. CONCLUSION: While limited in quantity, there is evidence of non-inferior effectiveness of caffeine against other methylxanthines or doxapram for the management of apnea in neonates. Owing to the limited quality, however, limited evidence exists in support of an optimal administration regimen for caffeine. Further controlled studies are, therefore, needed to confirm the comparative usefulness of caffeine as well as to assess its different potential regimens, including in relation to safety.

This is partly because this conceptualization could potentially be operationalized and used as the basis for AI and analytics tools which monitor and scaffold SRL in real-time. However, while there is an abundance of research on theories of SRL, little research explicitly reviews and operationalizes such theoretical considerations. Work is needed to develop frameworks for the practical applications of fundamental SRL theories, helping researchers move from conceptual considerations to operationalization in real world settings. In this paper, we propose a theoretically grounded framework for investigating SRL in the context of online tutoring for upper primary school learners. SRL is interpreted as a social learning construct, and the framework proposed is designed to investigate the influence of tutor practices on the development of learners’ SRL.

37162,From the editor: COVID-19 and international business policy,2020-07-24,"Parasites, and the diseases they cause, are important from an ecological and evolutionary perspective because they can negatively affect host fitness and can regulate host populations. Consequently, conservation biology has long recognized the vital role that parasites can play in the process of species endangerment and recovery. However, we are only beginning to understand how deeply parasites are embedded in ecological systems, and there is a growing recognition of the important ways in which parasites affect ecosystem structure and function. Thus, there is an urgent need to revisit how parasites are viewed from a conservation perspective and broaden the role that disease ecology plays in conservation-related research and outcomes. This review broadly focusses on the role that disease ecology can play in biological conservation. Our review specifically emphasizes on how the integration of tools and analytical approaches associated with both disease and molecular ecology can be leveraged to aid conservation biology. Our review first concentrates on disease-mediated extinctions and wildlife epidemics. We then focus on elucidating how host–parasite interactions has improved our understanding of the eco-evolutionary dynamics affecting hosts at the individual, population, community and ecosystem scales. We believe that the role of parasites as drivers and indicators of ecosystem health is especially an exciting area of research that has the potential to fundamentally alter our view of parasites and their role in biological conservation. The review concludes with a broad overview of the current and potential applications of modern genomic tools in disease ecology to aid biological conservation.","Gupta, Pooja; Robin, V.

The structure of them were further identified by UV, LC–ESI–MS–MS, 1H-NMR, and 13C-NMR as flavonoids F2 kaempferol 3-O-[β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 6)]-β-d-glucopyranoside and J2 kaempferol 3-O-[β-d-xylopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 6)]-β-d-glucopyranoside for the first time in C. Oleifera meal. The results of antibacterial activity measurement showed that both compounds have excellent antibacterial activity. And the antibacterial stability of F2 were finally confirmed: F2 showed broad spectrum antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enteriditis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus nigricans. Besides, F2 exhibited relatively high stable property even at high temperature, acid and metal ion solutions. The findings of this work suggest the possibility of employing C. oleifera meal as an attractive source of health-promoting compounds, and at the same time facilitate its high-value reuse and reduction of environmental burden.","Qiu, Yuanxin; He, Di; Yang, Jingxian; Ma, Lukai; Zhu, Kaiqi; Cao, Yong",Eur Food Res Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7415335/,697

First-line therapy with synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (sDMARD) is insufficiently effective in 40% of cases and these patients are treated with biotherapies. The increased use of these drugs each year is becoming a public health issue with considerable economic burden. This cost is 20 times higher than that of sDMARD. However, among patients treated with biotherapies, clinical practice shows that about one third will not respond to the selected drug. In nonresponse cases, practitioners currently have no choice but to perform an empirical switching between different treatments, because no tool capable of predicting the response or nonresponse to these molecules is currently available. METHODS: The study is a prospective, phase III, controlled, multicenter, and randomized, single-blind (patient) clinical trial, including RA patients with a previous failure to anti-TNF therapies. The main objective is the analysis of the clinical and pharmacoeconomic impact after 6 months of treatment. Intervention arm: prescription of biotherapy (rituximab, adalimumab, abatacept) using SinnoTest® software, a prediction software based on proteomic biomarkers. Control arm: prescription of biotherapy based on current practice, without the SinnoTest® software (any biotherapy). In addition, a substudy will be carried out within this trial to generate a biobank and further analyze the proteomic profile of the patients and their modification throughout the study. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial study will be the first validation study of a biotherapy response prediction software, bringing personalized medicine into the management of RA. We expect that the findings from this study will bring several benefits for the patient and the Health Care System. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClincalTrials.gov NCT04147026.

41155,Primum non nocere: Cuando el cuidado hospitalario no es necesario o es excesivo,2020-10-22,"Caseous lymphadenitis (CL) is a chronic infectious disease that affects sheep and goats. Many serological tests have been developed to detect the disease; one of the most widely used is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), due to its advantages, which include acceptable cost-effectiveness, applicability, sensitivity and specificity. ELISA formulations using recombinant proteins can exhibit significant sensitivity and specificity when using a single purified antigen. DTxR, Trx, TrxR, LexA, SodC, SpaC, NanH, and PknG recombinant proteins can be considered target proteins for ELISA development due to its extracellular or on the cell surface location, which allows a better recognition by the immune system. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the antigenic reactivity of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis recombinant proteins in goat and sheep serum. Of eight proteins evaluated, rSodC was selected for validation assays with small ruminant serum samples from the semiarid region of the state of Bahia, Brazil. Validation assays with goat serum samples showed that ELISA-rSodC presented sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 94%, respectively. Validation assays with sheep serum showed that ELISA-rSodC exhibited sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 98%, respectively. Analysis of 756 field serum samples showed that rSodC identified 95 positive samples (23%) in goats and 75 positive samples (21%) in sheep. The ELISA with recombinant SodC protein developed in this study discriminated positive and negative serum samples with high levels of sensitivity and specificity.

Taiwan is the leading country which took active epidemic prevention measures in local communities, including closing the community centers and programs for older adults. Older adults with chronic health conditions are particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic because they have disproportionally been affected by it. This study examined the associations between community environment and COVID-19 related stress of community-dwelling older adults with disabilities. Data were collected from a sample of 547 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 and over with disabilities in Taiwan between April and July, 2020. Multiple Regression Analysis was applied to test the hypothesized relationships. The analytic results suggested that: First, participants who were younger and with better cognitive functioning had higher levels of COVID-19 related stress. Second, as the confirmed case number dropped by month, participants interviewed in the later months expressed lower levels of COVID-19 related stress. Third, older adults who perceived more obstacles in their environment reported higher levels of COVID-19 related stress. In conclusion, although restrictions during the pandemic is inevitable to secure the safety of the public, programs should be designed for older adults with disabilities to remove the obstacles and to make information, policies and services more accessible in the communities to mitigate their COVID-19 related stress.","Yu, Meng-Hsuan; Chao, Shiau-Fang",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7740652/,697

This bacterial strain is now alarming serious health concern all over the world. Combating through available drugs is a difficult task due to lack of appropriate common targets against genetically diverse strains. Therefore, the developments of effective targets vaccines require alternative strategies to eliminate the H. pylori infection. In this study, we developed a novel vaccine construct using B-cell derived T-cell epitopes from four target antigenic proteins (HpaA, FlaA, FlaB and Omp18), and found the induction of possible immune response using advanced immunoinformatics approaches. In order to boost immune system, we tagged adjuvant (50S ribosomal protein L7/L12) with a suitable linker at the N-terminus side of vaccine sequence. Protein–protein docking between human Toll like receptor 5 (TLR5) and vaccine construct help to predict the way of inductive signaling that leads to immune-response. The calculated negative score (− 151.4, + / − 8.7) of molecular docking complex signify the best binding interface. Molecular dynamics simulation studies confirmed the proper docking between TLR5 and vaccine candidate. Moreover, Normal mode analysis (NMA) calculates the molecular motion of the docking complex. The low eigenvalue (2.935e(−05)) indicates the stable and flexible molecular motion in the binding interaction side. Finally, in-silico cloning of vaccine candidate was performed using expression vector pET28b (+) with the optimized restriction sites.

44898,Reviewing qualitative research approaches in the context of critical infrastructure resilience,2021-01-24,"The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung disorder with a high morbidity and mortality which affects all age groups. Despite active research with intense, ongoing attempts in developing pharmacological agents to treat ARDS, its mortality rate remains unaltered high and treatment is still only supportive. Over the years, there have been many attempts to identify meaningful subgroups likely to react differently to treatment among the heterogenous ARDS population, most of them unsuccessful. Only recently, analysis of large ARDS cohorts from randomized controlled trials have identified the presence of distinct biological subphenotypes among ARDS patients: a hypoinflammatory (or uninflamed; named P1) and a hyperinflammatory (or reactive; named P2) subphenotype have been proposed and corroborated with existing retrospective data. The hyperinflammatory subphenotyope was clearly associated with shock state, metabolic acidosis, and worse clinical outcomes. Core features of the respective subphenotypes were identified consistently in all assessed cohorts, independently of the studied population, the geographical location, the study design, or the analysis method. Additionally and clinically even more relevant treatment efficacies, as assessed retrospectively, appeared to be highly dependent on the respective subphenotype. This discovery launches a promising new approach to targeted medicine in ARDS. Even though it is now widely accepted that each ARDS subphenotype has distinct functional, biological, and mechanistic differences, there are crucial gaps in our knowledge, hindering the translation to bedside application. First of all, the underlying driving biological factors are still largely unknown, and secondly, there is currently no option for fast and easy identification of ARDS subphenotypes. This narrative review aims to summarize the evidence in biological subphenotyping in ARDS and tries to point out the current issues that will need addressing before translation of biological subohenotypes into clinical practice will be possible.","Wildi, Karin; Livingstone, Samantha; Palmieri, Chiara; LiBassi, Gianluigi; Suen, Jacky; Fraser, John",J Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7817965/,697

This development and its political implications have been addressed in various ways by scholars under the rubrics of “cosmopolitan,” “multidirectional,” “traveling,” “prosthetic,” “transnational,” and “agonistic” memory, but the new field of memory studies remains Eurocentric and relatively insensitive to the double-edged character of globalized memory—the interplay between de-territorialization and re-territorialization.

To explain this, we compared Halo-tagged and non-tagged IFNL3 and IFNL4 signaling in liver-derived cell lines. Transfection with non-tagged IFNL3, non-tagged IFNL4 and Halo-tagged IFNL4 led to a similar degree of JAK-STAT activation and ISG induction; however, the response to transfection with Halo-tagged IFNL3 was lower and delayed. Transfection with non-tagged IFNL3 or IFNL4 induced no transcriptome change in the cells lacking either IL10R2 or IFNLR1 receptor subunits. Cytosolic overexpression of signal peptide-lacking IFNL3 or IFNL4 in wild type cells did not interfere with JAK-STAT signaling triggered by interferons in the medium. Finally, expression profile changes induced by transfection with non-tagged IFNL3 and IFNL4 were highly similar. These data do not support the hypothesis about IFNL4-specific non-canonical signaling and point out that functional studies conducted with tagged interferons should be interpreted with caution.","Lunova, Mariia; Kubovciak, Jan; Smolková, Barbora; Uzhytchak, Mariia; Michalova, Kyra; Dejneka, Alexandr; Strnad, Pavel; Lunov, Oleg; Jirsa, Milan",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7961969/,697

Its primary role is to filter statistically small errors and to eliminate spurious measurements. SE requires an adequate number of measurements, varied, and strategically distributed in the power grid. Criticality analysis consists of identifying which combinations of measurements, forming tuples of different cardinalities, are essential for observing the power network as a whole. If a tuple of measurements becomes unavailable and, consequently, unobservable, the tuple is considered critical. The observability condition is verified by the factorization of the residual covariance matrix, which usually is a time-consuming computation task. Also, the search for criticalities is costly, being a combinatorial based problem. This paper proposes a parallel approach of the criticality analysis in the SE realm, through multi-threads execution on CPU and GPU environments. To date, no publication reporting the use of GPU for computing critical elements of the SE process is found in the specialized literature.

48687,Conclusion: Revisiting the Globally Oriented Citizen and Priorities for Empirical Research on Global Citizenship Education,2020-09-27,"Fractal and multifractal analysis interplay within complementary methodology is of pivotal importance in ubiquitously natural and man-made systems. Since the brain as a complex system operates on multitude of scales, the characterization of its dynamics through detection of self-similarity and regularity presents certain challenges. One framework to dig into complex dynamics and structure is to use intricate properties of multifractals. Morphological and functional points of view guide the analysis of the central nervous system (CNS). The former focuses on the fractal and self-similar geometry at various levels of analysis ranging from one single cell to complicated networks of cells. The latter point of view is defined by a hierarchical organization where self-similar elements are embedded within one another. Stroke is a CNS disorder that occurs via a complex network of vessels and arteries. Considering this profound complexity, the principal aim of this study is to develop a complementary methodology to enable the detection of subtle details concerning stroke which may easily be overlooked during the regular treatment procedures. In the proposed method of our study, multifractal regularization method has been employed for singularity analysis to extract the hidden patterns in stroke dataset with two different approaches. As the first approach, decision tree, Naïve bayes, kNN and MLP algorithms were applied to the stroke dataset. The second approach is made up of two stages: i) multifractal regularization (kulback normalization) method was applied to the stroke dataset and mFr_stroke dataset was generated. ii) the four algorithms stated above were applied to the mFr_stroke dataset. When we compared the experimental results obtained from the stroke dataset and mFr_stroke dataset based on accuracy (specificity, sensitivity, precision, F1-score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient), it was revealed that mFr_stroke dataset achieved higher accuracy rates. Our novel proposed approach can serve for the understanding and taking under control the transient features of stroke. Notably, the study has revealed the reliability, applicability and high accuracy via the methods proposed. Thus, the integrated method has revealed the significance of fractal patterns and accurate prediction of diseases in diagnostic and other critical-decision making processes in related fields.","Karaca, Yeliz; Baleanu, Dumitru; Moonis, Majaz; Zhang, Yu-Dong",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978571/,697

This chapter overviews the history of FDR in Australia to contextualise the development of online family dispute resolution (OFDR). As an extension to the already accessible Telephone Family Dispute Resolution service, OFDR offers the added value of multi-media engagement and innovative online tools to assist in easing the process of mediation for all stakeholders. From the introduction of the Family Law Act in Australia in 1975 to the 2006 Reforms, informal dispute processes are becoming recognised as fertile ground to deliver services via the use of advanced technologies.

48839,Lessons Learned and Social Futures: Building Social-Ecological Wellbeing in Coastal Communities,2020-10-08,"This chapter reiterates that the overall population of Japan continues to decline, although some municipalities have been successful in their community revitalization efforts. The reason some municipalities are successful may come from a realization of their municipal power. The Regional Revitalization Law of 2014 certainly facilitated municipalities in examining their demographic situations, and to realize their municipal power. However, it is questionable how much municipal power has been taken into consideration in community revitalization. Let us reiterate then, the very first step for regional revitalization is to realize its own municipal power, be it positive or negative. In the era of the so-called Society 5.0 , this chapter explores some successful cases of community revitalization through the active use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) programs. We pay close attention to successful application of community building, such as drones, the Internet of Things (IoT), open data, cloud service, crowdfunding, inbound tourism, and economies-sharing. We come to realize that modern ICT programs can help, but communities’ determination to assess their municipal power, both strengths and weaknesses, is of most importance. We must admit that there are some unresolved issues in the study. We are most willing to set them as essential themes for the future research of community revitalization in Japan. At this point we can point out two essential unresolved issues for future research. First, we emphasized municipal power such as marriage power, household type, and economic indicators for the population-sustaining power of municipalities. However, in our future research we need to explore other aspects of municipal power, to allow the pursuit of regional revitalization more effectively. Although it is difficult to measure, we need to tap on the subjective dimension of people who facilitate community revitalization. Second, we have made deliberate efforts in taking the Goki-Shichido, particularly its provinces, as our theoretical framework to examine regional differences in municipal power, especially within the same prefecture. We were successful in examining such prefectures as Tokyo and Aichi of the Tokaido region, Aomori and Yamagata of the Tosando region, Osaka of the Kinai region, Shimane of the Sannindo region, Kochi of the Nankaido region, and Fukuoka of the Saikaido region. Nevertheless, we need to test municipal power in other prefectures within the prefectural variations, such as Nagano of the Tosando, Shizuoka and Mie of the Tokaido, Hiroshima of the Sannyodo, and Fukui, Ishikawa, and Niigata of the Hokurikudo. Only if we know these prefectural, the Goki-Shichido, and provincial variations can we say that taking the Goki-Shichido as our theoretical framework for regional variation is validated. We believe, however, our studies on Municipal Power and Population Decline in Japan: Goki-Shichido and Regional Variations are significant in shedding light on an unexplored field. One effective strategy in fighting the problem of Japan’s declining population would be to bring foreign workers into the municipality. An example is Izumo-shi in Shimane Prefecture. The city successfully implemented the Multicultural Symbiosis Promotion Plan to settle foreign workers with Family Stay status into the municipality. The implementation of such a plan seems simple, but is difficult to achieve. Izumo-shi, however, has proved that getting foreign workers settled in the municipality, with their families, would be one of the most effective strategies for population decline.","Kumagai, Fumie",Municipal Power and Population Decline in Japan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978731/,697

The treatment planning process relies on collaboration and shared decision-making with clients to: (1) synthesize information from the assessment to identify specific problems to be solved; (2) set goals and objectives; (3) select interventions; and (4) monitor progress toward goals through documentation and periodic review. The product is a written plan of action that guides treatment. The treatment plan is derived from the case conceptualization of client strengths, problems, and access to resources developed from information in the assessment. The plan drives the selection of service interventions that can include psychotherapeutic approaches, skill development, rehabilitation, advocacy, self-help, and the acquisition of resources through case management. The specific areas of person-centered treatment planning covered in this chapter include: (1) developing a case conceptualization that synthesizes information from the psychosocial assessment to design a person-centered care plan; (2) developing goals and objectives that are specific, measurable, actionable, achievable, relevant, recovery-oriented, and time limited; (3) selecting interventions from a shared decision-making perspective; and (4) reviewing progress notes and documentation formats.

49569,Conclusion and Recommendations,2020-12-28,"In India, the use of online grocery shopping platforms—such as Big Basket, Amazon Pantry, Flipkart Supermarket, etc.—has been rising exponentially. The online grocery market value has been increasing steeply in recent years and is going to grow steadily, as the digital natives—the Millennial and the generation after them—grow older and start having families of their own. Given the importance of this growing market, there is surprisingly little research on the factors that are driving the adoption of online grocery in India today. Based on an extensive literature survey we first propose a conceptual model on the factors driving the online and offline grocery shopping behaviour of Indian consumers. We test the model using an online survey and a pan-India sample of 262 consumers. Our analysis suggests that the intention to purchase grocery online is significantly influenced by variety seeking, trust in seller, ease of use of online payments, convenience, purchase decision involvement, and preference for global products.","Sowmyanarayanan, R.; Krishnaa, Gowtam; Gupta, Deepak",Information and Communication Technology for Intelligent Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980903/,697
49621,Platforms,2021-02-26,"Change Management can be defined as the sum of tasks, measures and activities that are intended to bring about a comprehensive, cross-departmental and far-reaching change in an enterprise or organization. Change Management includes the implementation of new a mission, vision, strategies, structures, systems, processes and behaviours in an organization. The ultimate goal of change is to obtain a long-term favourable position in the market and to gain a sustainable competitive advantage (Helmold, 2020). Synonyms for Change management found in literature are Business Process Reengineering, Turnaround Management, Transformation Management, Lean Management, Innovation Management or Total Quality Management (Vahs, 2019). Change is increasingly determining the everyday businesses and activities of companies. In order to manage change in the most optimal way, special change management techniques are required, which can be summarized under the term Change Management (Lauer, 2019, 2020). The human factor is at the forefront of all considerations, because the implementation of change depends on the active support of employees. Since everyone has their own needs, ideas and experiences, some of which do not conform to the official company organization, there can be no simple recipe for how to successfully manage change. Rather, it is a complex process, that has to start at three points: the organization and individuals concerned, the corporate structures and the corporate culture (Lauer, 2019). Another important element in the context is the technological factor including systems, routines, methods and instruments (Helmold & Samara, 2019). Figure 3.1 summarizes the elements of change management.","Helmold, Marc","New Work, Transformational and Virtual Leadership",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980958/,697

We shall, therefore, try to disengage some of the knots linking gender violence and “cultural representations” but, above all, the “adaptive preferences” and “corrosive disadvantages” found in European women’s private lives, which clash totally with their social achievements and are attributable to emotional oppression and, simultaneously, with the amphibiotic habitus of which present-day women are unaware bearers.

Among COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been recognized as a risk factor for severe disease. Patients with T2DM may experience diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic (HHS) if infected with the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Regular blood analysis including arterial blood gas is essential in monitoring the care of patients with T2DM infected with COVID-19. We report five cases of DKA in patients with underlying T2DM that presented with severe COVID-19 infection. LEARNING POINTS: COVID-19 may cause acute metabolic dysregulations in patients with T2DM. It is important to monitor basic metabolic panel (BMP) and arterial blood gases (ABGs) in patients with COVID-19 since metabolic complications can develop unexpectedly. Patients with T2DM develop an inflammatory syndrome characterized by severe insulin resistance and B cell dysfunction that can lead to DKA.","Ramos-Yataco, Anthony; Meza, Kelly; Cecilia Farfán-García, Reyna; Ortega-Rojas, Solange; Salinas-Mamani, Isaac; Silva-Arrieta Ontaneda, Ivonne; Correa, Ricardo",Endocrinol Diabetes Metab Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7983528/,697

We find that eight languages comprise 80% of all tweets, with English, Japanese, Spanish, Arabic, and Portuguese being the most dominant. To quantify social spreading in each language over time, we compute the ‘contagion ratio’: The balance of retweets to organic messages. We find that for the most common languages on Twitter there is a growing tendency, though not universal, to retweet rather than share new content. By the end of 2019, the contagion ratios for half of the top 30 languages, including English and Spanish, had reached above 1—the naive contagion threshold. In 2019, the top 5 languages with the highest average daily ratios were, in order, Thai (7.3), Hindi, Tamil, Urdu, and Catalan, while the bottom 5 were Russian, Swedish, Esperanto, Cebuano, and Finnish (0.26). Further, we show that over time, the contagion ratios for most common languages are growing more strongly than those of rare languages.","Alshaabi, Thayer; Dewhurst, David Rushing; Minot, Joshua R.; Arnold, Michael V.; Adams, Jane L.; Danforth, Christopher M.; Dodds, Peter Sheridan",EPJ Data Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8010293/,697

Our institution created a competency based virtual endocrinology elective to provide continued clinical experience with a focus on type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and health equity in diabetes care. Methods: A 4-week virtual endocrinology elective alternated between different mini-rotations to maximize exposure to inpatient and outpatient endocrine care, as well as self-directed and faculty/fellow directed educational experiences. Post-elective surveys assessed student satisfaction with elective components and change in comfort levels with T2DM management and social determinants of health (SDH) on diabetes care. Results: Overall, 87% (n=13) of students were “extremely satisfied” with the elective. Increased comfort was seen with management of type 2 DM and the impact of SDH on DM care (DM 88% neutral/uncomfortable to 94% comfortable, SDH 50% neutral/uncomfortable to 94% comfortable). Students were satisfied with the quality of patient care and requested opportunities for more direct involvement. Conclusions: This virtual endocrine elective shows that curricula can be creatively designed to educate students in endocrinology, assess students across core competencies, and demonstrate impacts of telehealth and social determinants of health on endocrine and patient care.","Moxley, Meaghan C; Lamos, Elizabeth; Malek, Rana",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089552/,697

In vivo, synchronous single-cell coinfection by multiple viruses, the ultimate prerequisite to viral recombination, is likely to be a rare event and delayed secondary infections are a more probable occurrence. Here, we determine the effect of a temporal separation of in vitro infections with the two homologous murine norovirus strains MNV-1 WU20 and CW1 on the composition of nascent viral populations. WU20 and CW1 were either synchronously inoculated onto murine macrophage cell monolayers (coinfection) or asynchronously applied (superinfection with varying titres of CW1 at half-hour to 24-h delays). Then, 24 h after initial co-or superinfection, quantification of genomic copy numbers and discriminative screening of plaque picked infectious progeny viruses demonstrated a time-dependent predominance of primary infecting WU20 in the majority of viral progenies. Our results indicate that a time interval from one to two hours onwards between two consecutive norovirus infections allows for the establishment of a barrier that reduces or prevents superinfection.","Ludwig-Begall, Louisa F.; Di Felice, Elisabetta; Toffoli, Barbara; Ceci, Chiara; Di Martino, Barbara; Marsilio, Fulvio; Mauroy, Axel; Thiry, Etienne",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147416/,697

53723,The doctrine of normal tendency in active learning teaching methodology: investigations into probability distributions and averages,2021-05-31,"[Image: see text] Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) is a serine protease that plays vital roles in inflammation, innate immune response, and tissue remodeling processes. HNE has been actively pursued as a drug target, particularly for the treatment of cardiopulmonary diseases. Although thousands of molecules have been reported to inhibit HNE, yet very few are being evaluated in early clinical trials, with sivelestat as the only approved HNE inhibitor. We report here a novel chemotype of sulfonated nonsaccharide heparin mimetics as potent and noncompetitive inhibitors of HNE. Using a chromogenic substrate hydrolysis assay, 14 sulfonated nonsaccharide heparin mimetics were tested for their inhibitory activity against HNE. Only 12 molecules inhibited HNE with IC(50) values of 0.22–88.3 μM. The inhibition of HNE by these molecules was salt-dependent. Interestingly, a specific hexa-sulfonated molecule inhibited HNE with an IC(50) value of 0.22 μM via noncompetitive mechanism, as demonstrated by Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The hexa-sulfonated derivative demonstrated at least 455-, 221-, 1590-, 21-, and 381-fold selectivity indices over other heparin-binding coagulation proteins including factors IIa, Xa, IXa, XIa, and FXIIIa, respectively. At the highest concentrations tested, the molecule also did not significantly inhibit other serine proteases of plasmin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. Further supporting its selectivity, the molecule did not show heparin-like effects on clotting times of human plasma. The molecule also did not affect the proliferation of three cell lines at a concentration as high as 10 μM. Interestingly, the hexa-sulfonated molecule also inhibited cathepsin G with an IC(50) value of 0.57 μM alluding to a dual anti-inflammatory action. A computational approach was exploited to identify putative binding site(s) for this novel class of HNE inhibitors. Overall, the reported hexa-sulfonated nonsaccharide heparin mimetic serves as a new platform to develop potent, selective, and noncompetitive inhibitors of HNE for therapeutic purposes.","Al-Horani, Rami A.; Aliter, Kholoud F.; Kar, Srabani; Mottamal, Madhusoodanan",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8154244/,697

Indeed, more frequently, it occurs that innovations born in the so called ""emerging countries"" spread in the advanced ones. This phenomenon is well known as Reverse innovation (RI), and within the global innovation literature about RI, some authors refer to these reversed innovations as developed in order to solve social or economic issues, specific of emerging contexts. However, scholars use to connect innovation with social goal as primary benefit to another phenomenon: i.e., Social innovation (SI). Within the Social innovation literature, there is a lack concerning how it should be undertaken to spread globally. Thus, we applied the Reverse innovation process to Social innovations: through a case-study analysis, we link the two phenomena which have never been explored together in previous studies. The paper aims at understanding how Social innovations spread from emerging to more advanced markets, while implementing this inversion of the flow. Further, we want to explore which is the potential that a Social innovation has in the host market: in other words, if SI could lose, hold, reduce, or increase their original social connotation.","Cannavale, Chiara; Claudio, Lorenza; Simoni, Michele",Ital,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8178648/,697

Unlike other non‐agricultural firms that were mandated to close at times, the pork sector was deemed an essential service and allowed to continue operating throughout the pandemic. Evidence of this resiliency is seen in three main ways. First, market access to the United States was maintained for both live pigs and pork exports. Second, Canada not only maintained market share in global pork exports, but it also actually increased shipments because of strong demand from China caused by African swine fever. Third, the challenges of processing plant closures and labour shortages were overcome in a variety of ways including increasing interprovincial shipments and increasing live pig exports to the United States. Pork consumption on a per capita basis continued the historical downward trend, and it is expected that consumers will return to their normal consumption patterns (e.g., dining at restaurants) despite job losses. At the meat processing level, it is anticipated that there will be an acceleration in the process to automate.","McEwan, Ken; Marchand, Lynn; Shang, Max Zongyuan",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8251273/,697

The results show that among all the subjects, nearly 20% of them do not understand entrepreneurship, nearly 85% of them concern about the risk of entrepreneurship, and nearly 70% of them take a negative attitude toward entrepreneurial failure. Meanwhile, the subjects have not formed an independent view on entrepreneurship, the subjects’ basic entrepreneurial quality is poor, their entrepreneurship awareness is weak, and their entrepreneurial psychological quality is poor. The subjects lack entrepreneurial quality rather than entrepreneurial knowledge. Finally, some suggestions are put forward on education on virtual entrepreneurship practice in higher education institutions from four aspects: improving the external environment of entrepreneurship, improving the entrepreneurship curriculum in higher education institutions, improving the teaching staff, and developing the practice bases for entrepreneurship education. The results provide some ideas about promoting the comprehensive reform of talent training mode in higher education institutions.","An, Hengjie; Xu, Yuanyuan",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8357997/,697

The main goal of this investigation was to show the effect of Se supplementation, at levels slightly higher than the recommended values, combined with natural zeolite clinoptilolite on Se deposition in tissues (muscle and liver) and on the immune and antioxidative status of supplemented growing pigs. The experiment was carried out during a 98 d period on 60 pigs. Pigs were fed a standard feed mixture based on corn and soybean and were divided into four groups, according to the level of dietary selenium supplementation as follows: C-0.3 mg/kg DM organic Se, E1-0.5 mg/kg DM sodium selenite, E2-0.5 mg/kg DM organic selenium; E3-0.5 mg/kg DM organic Se+0.2% zeolite. Higher (P < 0.05) selenium concentrations were determined in the muscle and liver in growing pigs fed with higher organic Se in combination with zeolite compared to the lower organic Se concentration. Addition of organic Se increased (P < 0.05) Se deposition in muscle and liver compared to the equal amount of inorganic Se (E2 vs. E1). Higher organic Se in combination with natural zeolite addition increases (P < 0.05) proportion of pigs' cluster of differentiation (CD)45(+) compared to the same amount of inorganic Se and lower organic Se addition. The proportion of CD45(+) and CD4(+) lymphocytes was higher (P < 0.05) in E3 group compared to the other groups. Higher (P < 0.05) proportion of CD21(+) lymphocytes were measured in the E2 and E3 groups compared with the other groups. The highest (P < 0.01) activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in pig erythrocytes was observed in the E3 group, while higher (P < 0.05) activity of glutathione reductase (GR) was in all experimental groups related to the control one. A dietary addition of 0.5 mg/kg DM of organic Se in combination with zeolite (0.2% DM) has increased (P < 0.05) Se deposition in liver, muscle, and blood, compared to the dietary addition of 0.3 mg/kg DM of the organic Se.","Šperanda, Tomislav; Pavić, Valentina; Lončarić, Zdenko; Šperanda, Marcela; Popović, Maja; Gantner, Vesna; Ðidara, Mislav",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8362895/,697

Due to the nonlinearity in stock data, a model developed using the traditional or a single intelligent technique may not accurately forecast results. Therefore, there is a need to develop a hybridization of intelligent techniques for an effective predictive model. In this study, we propose an intelligent forecasting method based on a hybrid of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and uses two US stock market indices, DOW30 and NASDAQ100, for forecasting. The data were partitioned into training, testing, and validation datasets. The model validation was done on the stock data of the COVID-19 period. The experimental findings obtained using the DOW30 and NASDAQ100 reveal that the accuracy of the GA and ANN hybrid model for the DOW30 and NASDAQ100 is greater than that of the single ANN (BPANN) technique, both in the short and long term.","Sharma, Dinesh K.; Hota, H.

Impacts of Pro-regime Social Media Comments on Chinese Netizens,2021-09-04,"This paper presents a novel discriminative Few-shot learning architecture based on batch compact loss. Currently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has achieved reasonably good performance in image recognition. Most existing CNN methods facilitate classifiers to learn discriminating patterns to identify existing categories trained with large samples. However, learning to recognize novel categories from a few examples is a challenging task. To address this, we propose the Residual Compact Network to train a deep neural network to learn hierarchical nonlinear transformations to project image pairs into the same latent feature space, under which the distance of each positive pair is reduced. To better use the commonality of class-level features for category recognition, we develop a batch compact loss to form robust feature representations relevant to a category. The proposed methods are evaluated on several datasets. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed method achieves acceptable results in Few-shot learning.","Li, Liang; Jin, Weidong; Huang, Yingkun",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8412402/,697

Based on the created pharmacophore model of the active site of the protease, a group of compounds were modeled and tested for activity against 3CLpro. The 3CLpro activity was measured using the fluorogenic substrate Dabcyl-VNSTLQSGLRK(FAM)MA; the efficiency of the proposed approach was confirmed by comparison with literature data for ebselen and disulfiram. The results of the experiments performed with bispidine compounds showed that 14 compounds exhibited activity in the concentration range 1–10 μM, and 3 samples exhibited submicromolar activity. The structure–activity relationship studies showed that the molecules containing a carbonyl group in the ninth position of the bicycle exhibited the maximum activity.

The purpose of this study was the evaluation of procedural and outcome data of patients ≥90 years undergoing endovascular stroke treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data of patients ≥90 years in whom endovascular stroke treatment was performed between January 2011 and January 2016. Recanalization was assessed according to the TICI score. The clinical condition was evaluated on admission (NIHSS, prestroke mRS), at discharge (NIHSS), and after 3 months (mRS). RESULTS Twenty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria for this analysis. The median prestroke mRS was 2. Successful recanalization (TICI ≥ 2b) was achieved in 22 patients (75.9%). In 9 patients, an NIHSS improvement ≥ 10 points was noted between admission and discharge. After 3 months, 17.2% of the patients had an mRS of 0-2 or exhibited prestroke mRS, and 24.1% achieved mRS 0-3. Mortality rate was 44.8%. There was only 1 minor procedure-related complication (small SAH without clinical sequelae). CONCLUSIONS Despite high mortality rates and only moderate overall outcome, 17.2% of the patients achieved mRS 0-2 or prestroke mRS, and no serious procedure-related complications occurred. Therefore, very high age should not per se be an exclusion criterion for endovascular stroke treatment.","Möhlenbruch, M; Pfaff, J; Schönenberger, S; Nagel, S; Bösel, J; Herweh, C; Ringleb, P; Bendszus, M; Stampfl, S",AJNR.

This study investigated vaccine awareness and opinions on the anti-vaccination movement among students at three faculties of Eastern Mediterranean University. Data were collected by questionnaire. Exposure to anti-vaccination propaganda increased proportionally with the size of the cities where participants were born. In total, 88.6% of the participants declared that they planned to vaccinate their children, while those who did not cited various reasons including the belief that vaccines do not work, that vaccines are harmful, and that it is better to be infected naturally. 60.6% of participants reported that they would get vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 if there was an effective vaccine. Meanwhile, 24.5% of participants were not sure whether would get vaccinated even if it were possible, 11.4% of participants stated that they would not vaccinate their children for a variety of reasons. These results are important, especially in the context of a pandemic, because students will become leaders in education, business, and media, and thus shape the thoughts and opinions of future generations. The anti-vaccination movement is building momentum, and is especially influential in big cities; therefore, it is vital to change our approach to informing students about vaccination.","Guzoglu, Nilufer; Daneshvar, Zahra; Hamrang, Elmira; Kayisbudak, Ilayda Deniz; Khasawneh, Hayel; Mahmoud, Omar Yasser; Sani, Abeer Mohammad; Sokmen, Gorkem",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1891815; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720809/,697

We sought to determine: 1) the quiescent variability of cerebral, renal, and splanchnic rSO2 in clinically stable, undisturbed very low birth weight neonates and 2) the effects of different data averaging epochs on site-specific variability. STUDY DESIGN In this prospective, observational study, neonates between 500 and 1250 g underwent seven days of continuous, real-time cerebral, renal, and splanchnic NIRS monitoring starting within the first seventy-two postnatal hours. Demographic, cardiopulmonary, bedside care, and rSO2 data were collected. rSO2 variability was analyzed utilizing data from quiescent periods identified using pre-specified stability criteria. Between- and within-monitoring site comparisons of data averaging methods were made utilizing ANOVA. RESULT Twenty-four subjects (GA 27 ± 0.3 wk, birth weight 988 ± 34 g; mean ± SEM) were monitored. Coefficients of variation (CoVar = SD/mean) were calculated for each monitoring site using varied data averaging epochs. CoVar was lowest for cerebral, intermediate for renal, and highest for splanchnic rSO2 (P < 0.01). For renal and splanchnic sites, shorter epochs (5- and 15-min) resulted in significantly smaller CoVars [P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively]. Splanchnic variability was highly dependent on epoch length, ranging from 16% over 5 min to 23% over 60 min. CONCLUSION 1) rSO2 variability differs significantly between monitoring sites and 2) shorter data sampling epochs decrease rSO2 variability. These observations may assist clinicians in operationally defining minimally significant departures to enable medical decision making utilizing this monitoring technique.","Mintzer, J P; Parvez, B; Chelala, M; Alpan, G; LaGamma, E F",Journal of neonatal-perinatal medicine,https://doi.org/10.3233/npm-14814035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25322996/,697

Lycopene (LYC) has been used as a dietary supplement that has effective antioxidant and anti-obesity functions. The present goal was to understand the molecular mechanisms of LYC preventing DEHP-induced lipid metabolism of liver. The mice were intragastrically administered with LYC (5 mg/kg) and/or DEHP (500 mg/kg or 1000 mg/kg). Here, we found that LYC attenuated DEHP-caused hepatic histopathological lesions including steatosis. Hematological and biochemical analyses revealed that LYC ameliorated DEHP-caused liver function and lipid metabolism disorders. DEHP caused lipid metabolism disorders via activating the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α/γ (PPARα/γ) signal transducer and Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)/Liver X receptor (LXR) signaling pathway. As a major regulator of lipid metabolism, Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) system was elevated with increased fatty degeneration under DEHP exposure. However, LYC could decrease the levels of HIF-1α/PPARα/PPARγ/FXR/LXR signaling pathway related factors. Our research indicated that LYC could prevent DEHP-induced lipid metabolism disorders via inhibiting the HIF-1α-mediated PPARα/PPARγ/FXR/LXR system. This study may provide a possible molecular mechanism fatty liver induced by DEHP.","Zhao, Yi; Ma, De-Xing; Wang, Hong-Guang; Li, Mu-Zi; Talukder, Milton; Wang, Hao-Ran; Li, Jinlong",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c05077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962341/,697

Due to different testing strategies, under-detection of positive subjects and COVID-19-related-deaths remains common. Aim of this analysis was to assess the real impact of COVID-19 through the analysis of 2020 Italian all-cause mortality data compared to historical series. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 2020 and 2015-2019 all-cause mortality data released by the Italian National Institute for Statistics (ISTAT) for the time period 'January 1 - March 21'. This preliminary sample included 1,084 Italian municipalities showing at least 10 deaths during the above-mentioned timeframe and an increase in mortality of more than 20% as compared to the previous five years (2015-2019), with a resulting coverage of 21% of Italian population. The difference between 2020 observed and expected deaths (mean of weekly deaths in 2015-2019) was computed, together with mortality rate ratio (MRR) for each of the four weeks following detection of the first autochthonous COVID-19 case in Italy (23 February, 2020 - 21 March, 2020), as well as for this entire timeframe. Subgroup analysis by age groups was also performed. RESULTS Overall MRR was 1.79 [1.75-1.84], with an observed excess mortality of 8,750 individuals in the investigated sample, which in itself outweighs Italian Civil Protection report of only 4,825 COVID-19-related deaths across Italy, as of March 21. Subgroup analysis did not show any difference in mortality rate in '0-14 years' age group, while MRRs were significantly increased in older age groups, in particular in patients >75 years (MRR 1.84 [1.79-1.89]). In addition, week-by-week analysis showed a progressive increase in MRR during this period, peaking in the last week (15 March, 2020 - 21 March, 2020) with an estimated value of 2.65 [2.53-2.78]. CONCLUSIONS The analysis of all-cause mortality data in Italy indicates that reported COVID-19-related deaths are an underestimate of the actual death toll. All-cause death should be seen as the epidemiological indicator of choice to assess the real mortality impact exerted by SARS-CoV-2, given that it also best reflects the toll on frail patient subsets (eg the elderly or those with cardiovascular disease).","Saglietto, Andrea; D'ascenzo, Fabrizio; Cavarretta, Elena; Frati, Giacomo; Anselmino, Matteo; Versaci, Francesco; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; De Ferrari, Gaetano M",Minerva cardioangiologica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0026-4725.20.05349-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32996311/,697

Exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which causes TB, either results in direct elimination of the pathogen, most likely by the innate immune system, or infection and containment that requires both innate and adaptive immunity to form the granuloma. Host defense strategies against infectious diseases are comprised of both host resistance, which is the ability of the host to prevent invasion or to eliminate the pathogen and disease tolerance, which is defined by limiting the collateral tissue damage. In this review we aim to examine the metabolic demands of the immune cells involved in both host resistance and disease tolerance; chiefly the macrophage and T-lymphocyte. We will further discuss how baseline metabolic heterogeneity and inflammation-driven metabolic reprogramming during infection is linked to their key immune functions containing mycobacterial growth and instructing protective immunity.

Large-scale population screening is an effective means to control the spread of COVID-19. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and serology assays are the most available techniques for SARS-CoV-2 detection; however, they suffer from either less sensitivity and accuracy or low instrument accessibility for screening. To balance the sensitivity, specificity, and test availability, here, we developed enhanced colorimetry, which is termed as a magnetic pull-down-assisted colorimetric method based on the CRISPR/Cas12a system (M-CDC), for SARS-CoV-2 detection. By this method, SARS-CoV-2 RNA from synthetic sequences and cultured viruses can be detected by the naked eye based on gold nanoparticle (AuNP) probes, with a detection limit of 50 RNA copies per reaction. With CRISPR/Cas12a-assisted detection, SARS-CoV-2 can be specifically distinguished from other closely related viruses. M-CDC was further used to analyze 41 clinical samples, whose performance was 95.12%, consistent with that of an approved Clinical RT-qPCR Diagnosis kit. The developed M-CDC method is not dependent on sophisticated instruments, which makes it potentially valuable to be applied for SARS-CoV-2 screening under poor conditions.","Jiang, Yongzhong; Hu, Menglu; Liu, An-An; Lin, Yi; Liu, Linlin; Yu, Bo; Zhou, Xiaoming; Pang, Dai-Wen",ACS sensors,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.0c02365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33683104/,697

Yet, the concomitant urinary diversion is typically performed extracorporeally at most centers, primarily because intracorporeal diversion is perceived as technically complex and arduous. Previous reports on robotic, intracorporeal, orthotopic neobladder may not have fully replicated established open principles of reservoir configuration, leading to concerns about long-term functional outcomes. OBJECTIVE To illustrate step-by-step our technique for robotic, intracorporeal, orthotopic, ileal neobladder, urinary diversion with strict adherence to open surgical tenets. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From July 2010 to May 2012, 24 patients underwent robotic intracorporeal neobladder at a single tertiary cancer center. This report presents data on patients with a minimum of 3-mo follow-up (n=8). SURGICAL PROCEDURE We performed robotic RC, extended lymphadenectomy to the inferior mesenteric artery, and complete intracorporeal diversion. Our surgical technique is demonstrated in the accompanying video. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Baseline demographics, pathology data, 90-d complications, and functional outcomes were assessed and compared with patients undergoing intracorporeal ileal conduit diversion (n=7). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Robotic intracorporeal urinary diversion was successfully performed in 15 patients (neobladder: 8 patients, ileal conduit: 7 patients) with a minimum 90-d follow-up. Median age and body mass index were 68 yr and 27 kg/m2, respectively. In the neobladder cohort, median estimated blood loss was 225 ml (range: 100-700 ml), median time to regular diet was 5 d (range: 4-10 d), median hospital stay was 8 d (range: 5-27 d), and 30- and 90-d complications were Clavien grade 1-2 (n=5 and 0), Clavien grade 3-5 (n=2 and 1), respectively. This study is limited by small sample size and short follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS An intracorporeal technique of robot-assisted orthotopic neobladder and ileal conduit is presented, wherein established open principles are diligently preserved. This step-wise approach is demonstrated to help shorten the learning curve of other surgeons contemplating robotic intracorporeal urinary diversion.","Goh, Alvin C; Gill, Inderbir S; Lee, Dennis J; de Castro Abreu, Andre Luis; Fairey, Adrian S; Leslie, Scott; Berger, Andre K; Daneshmand, Siamak; Sotelo, Rene; Gill, Karanvir S; Xie, Hui Wen; Chu, Leo Y; Aron, Monish; Desai, Mihir M",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2012.07.052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22920581/,697

83980,Using Virtual Standardized Patients in Behavioral Health Interprofessional Education.,2020-10-01,"The C-type lectin DC-SIGN expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) facilitates capture and internalization of a plethora of different pathogens. Although it is known that DC-SIGN organizes in nanoclusters at the surface of DCs, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this well defined nanopatterning and role in viral binding remain enigmatic. By combining biochemical and advanced biophysical techniques, including optical superresolution and single particle tracking, we demonstrate that DC-SIGN intrinsic nanoclustering strictly depends on its molecular structure. DC-SIGN nanoclusters exhibited free, Brownian diffusion on the cell membrane. Truncation of the extracellular neck region, known to abrogate tetramerization, significantly reduced nanoclustering and concomitantly increased lateral diffusion. Importantly, DC-SIGN nanocluster dissolution exclusively compromised binding to nanoscale size pathogens. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that heterogeneity on nanocluster density and spatial distribution confers broader binding capabilities to DC-SIGN. As such, our results underscore a direct relationship between spatial nanopatterning, driven by intermolecular interactions between the neck regions, and receptor diffusion to provide DC-SIGN with the exquisite ability to dock pathogens at the virus length scale. Insight into how virus receptors are organized prior to virus binding and how they assemble into functional platforms for virus docking is helpful to develop novel strategies to prevent virus entry and infection.","Manzo, Carlo; Torreno-Pina, Juan A; Joosten, Ben; Reinieren-Beeren, Inge; Gualda, Emilio J; Loza-Alvarez, Pablo; Figdor, Carl G; Garcia-Parajo, Maria F; Cambi, Alessandra",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m112.380121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23019323/,697
84456,Social learning from media: The need for a culturally diachronic developmental psychology.,2021,"OBJECTIVES. To review the characteristics of a series of obstetric patients admitted to the intensive care unit in a regional hospital in 2006-2010, to compare them with those of a similar series reported from the same hospital in 1989-1995 and a series reported from another regional hospital in 1998-2007. DESIGN. Retrospective case series. SETTING. A regional hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS. Obstetric patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Kwong Wah Hospital from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2010. RESULTS. From 2006 to 2010, there were 67 such patients admitted to the intensive care unit (0.23% of total maternities and 2.34% of total intensive care unit admission), which was a higher incidence than reported in two other local studies. As in the latter studies, the majority were admitted postpartum (n=65, 97%), with postpartum haemorrhage (n=39, 58%) being the commonest cause followed by pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (n=17, 25%). In the current study, significantly more patients had had elective caesarean sections for placenta praevia but fewer had had a hysterectomy. The duration of intensive care unit stay was shorter (mean, 1.8 days) with fewer invasive procedures performed than in the two previous studies, but maternal and neonatal mortality was similar (3% and 6%, respectively). CONCLUSION. Postpartum haemorrhage and pregnancy-induced hypertension were still the most common reasons for intensive care unit admission. There was an increasing trend of intensive care unit admissions following elective caesarean section for placenta praevia and for early aggressive intervention of pre-eclampsia. Maternal mortality remained low but had not decreased. The intensive care unit admission rate by itself might not be a helpful indicator of obstetric performance.","Ng, Vivian K S; Lo, T K; Tsang, H H; Lau, W L; Leung, W C",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.12809/hkmj133924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23784532/,697

Such interest has grown with the increasing availability of smart phones and tablets. In this review we examine the literature documenting human social learning and how this learning is impacted when the instructing agent appears on a screen instead of face-to-face. We then explore the shifting nature of screen-based media, with a focus on the increasingly socio-normative manner information is portrayed. We discuss how the changing nature of screen technology might be altering how children interpret what they see, and raise the possibility that this may render prevailing evidence as historical documentation, rather than setting out established developmental milestones that transcend the period in which they were documented. We contend that recognizing the significance of historically changing contexts in developmental psychology is timely when the COVID-19 climate is pushing data collection on-line for many labs, often using tasks that were developed primarily for face-to-face contexts.","Nielsen, Mark; Fong, Frankie T K; Whiten, Andrew",Advances in child development and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.acdb.2021.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34266569/,697

This was a quality improvement project prompted by an adverse event after a telemedicine visit. METHODS We reviewed all completed telemedicine and conventional visits from March 26 to June 1 of 2020 and 2019 to identify patients who required an ED visit or hospital admission within eight weeks after the visit. RESULTS In 2020, the overall rate of ED visits of hospital admission within eight weeks of a neurology visit was less than 5%. Comparing 2020 with 2019: (1) cohorts were similar for age, payor, state of residence, medical complexity, recommendation for close follow-up, new medications, or new tests ordered; (2) it took longer to present to the ED (by 10 days) or to be hospitalized (by three days); (3) planned admissions were approximately 50% lower; (4) on multivariate analysis, risk factors for any ED/admission included a patient call within seven days before the ED/admission (P = 0.0004) or being seen by an epilepsy specialist (P = 0.02); (5) a presenting complaint of worsening symptoms had a lower odds ratio of subsequent ED visit/admission (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine is safe, with a similar likelihood of ED or hospital admission during the pandemic in 2020 versus before the pandemic in 2019. In 2020, even if patients described worse symptoms at the time of their clinic visit, the odds of ED or hospital admission were lower than in 2019, but those who called after the telemedicine visit were more likely to be seen in ED or require hospitalization.","Joshi, Charuta; Jacobson, Mona; Silveira, Lori; Shea, Stephanie; Yang, Michele; Eschbach, Krista",Pediatric neurology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2021.06.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34243046/,697

Abdominal wall desmoid tumors are rare, but they can be locally aggressive, with high incidence of recurrence. These tumors are more common in young, fertile women. They frequently occur during or after pregnancy. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 63-year-old post-menopausal woman with a desmoid tumor of the anterior abdominal wall. She had no relevant family history. During abdominoplasty, an incidental mass was excised and biopsied, and was identified as a desmoid tumor with free margins. One year later, the patient presented with vague abdominal discomfort and feeling of heaviness. An incision was made through the previous abdominoplasty scar to maintain the aesthetic outcome. A large mass, arising from the abdominal wall and extending intra-abdominally, was excised and was determined to be a recurrent desmoid tumor. CONCLUSIONS Recurrent anterior abdominal wall desmoid tumors in post-menopausal women are rare and locally aggressive, with a high risk of recurrence. During abdominal wall repair in abdominoplasty, desmoid tumor filaments might seed deep intra-abdominally. Therefore, it is necessary to take adequate safe margins before abdominal wall repair. Post-operatively, surgeons should keep a high index of suspicion for tumor recurrence.","Muneer, Mohammed; Badran, Saif; Zahid, Rehan; Abdelmageed, Amal; AlDulaimi, Mohamed Murshid",The American journal of case reports,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.916227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31270310/,697

Few studies have examined perceived impacts of SIV introduction beyond disease reduction on health systems; understanding such impacts will be particularly salient in the context of COVID-19 vaccine introduction. We collected qualitative data from key informants-Partnership for Influenza Vaccine Introduction (PIVI) contacts in six middle-income PIVI vaccine recipient countries-to understand perceptions of ancillary benefits and challenges from SIV implementation. Respondents reported benefits associated with SIV introduction, including improved attitudes to SIV among risk groups (characterized by increased demand) and perceptions that SIV introduction improved relationships with other ministries and collaboration with mass media. Challenges included sustaining investment in SIV programs, as vaccine supply did not always meet coverage goals, and managing SIV campaigns.","Ebama, Malembe S; Chu, Susan Y; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Lafond, Kathryn E; McCarron, Margaret; Hadler, Stephen C; Porter, Rachael M; McKinlay, Mark; Bresee, Joseph",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.02.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33714656/,697

89092,Editorial: Parting Words and Opening Thoughts.,2020-06-16,"We report two pediatric retinoblastoma patients with unusual ophthalmic artery (OA) origins who were referred to our interventional neuroradiology department for intraarterial chemotherapy. The first patient had double OAs arising from the ipsilateral internal carotid artery and a central retinal artery (CRA) arising from the more cranially located artery, whereas the second patient had an OA originating from the A1 segment of the ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery. In both cases the CRA arose from the artery entering the orbit through the optic foramen. Both patients tolerated the procedures well. To the best of our knowledge, our retinoblastoma patients with unusual OA origins are the first in the literature in which detailed knowledge of the orbital vasculature and especially CRA origin carried immediate clinical implications, altering access strategies. These variations were proved both by flat-panel detector computed tomography findings and superselective injections of OAs with unusual origins. Our results show that in patients with retinoblastoma, a detailed angiographic work-up may be necessary to evaluate the orbital vasculature and possible abnormal origin of the OA. Recognition of possible variations of OA origin and its branching patterns is of the utmost importance for successful treatment and avoidance of adverse events among retinoblastoma patients.","Balci, Sinan; Arat, Anıl","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019919852737; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159631/,697

Although a large number of computational models of the olfactory system have been proposed, they do not account for the diversity in physiology, connectivity of local neurons, and several recent discoveries in the insect antennal lobe, a major olfactory organ in insects. Recent studies revealed that the response of some projection neurons were reduced by application of a GABA antagonist, and that insects are sensitive to odor pulse frequency. To account for these observations, we propose a spiking neural circuit model of the insect antennal lobe. Based on recent anatomical and physiological studies, we included three sub-types of local neurons as well as synaptic short-term depression (STD) in the model and showed that the interaction between STD and local neurons resulted in frequency-sensitive responses. We further discovered that the unexpected response of the projection neurons to the GABA antagonist is the result of complex interactions between STD and presynaptic inhibition, which is required for enhancing sensitivity to odor stimuli. Finally, we found that odor discrimination is improved if the innervation of the local neurons in the glomeruli follows a specific pattern. Our findings suggest that STD, presynaptic inhibition and diverse physiology and connectivity of local neurons are not independent properties, but they interact to play key roles in the function of antennal lobes.","Kao, Kuo-Wei; Lo, Chung-Chuan",Journal of computational neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10827-020-00747-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388764/,697

We aimed to elucidate the effects of different examination conditions on image quality, diagnostic ability, and quantitative value of amyloid PET using 18F-flutemetamol. METHODS We acquired data on a Discovery PET/computed tomography 710 scanner using Hoffman brain and pillar phantoms with 20 MBq of 18F for 30 min. The images were reconstructed into 10-, 20-, and 30-min periods. The ordered subset-expectation maximization algorithm was used for image reconstruction, which uses a 2- or 4-mm Gaussian filter and a combination of iteration and subset numbers. The percentage contrast and coefficient of variation (CV; as the image noise) were used as physical evaluation indices for reconstructed images, and images with superior contrast and low image noise were selected for clinical evaluation. The imaging data of 15 symptomatic patients (n = 7 and n = 8 for positive and negative diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease, respectively) were reconstructed under the phantom study conditions. Radiographers visually evaluated and ranked the clinical images based on the overall contrast and image noise, and nuclear medicine specialists diagnosed Alzheimer's disease. We compared the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) obtained with different acquisition conditions. RESULTS The basic study using the phantom revealed high convergence of contrast and image noise in five patterns of acquisition time and filter strengths. Regarding visual evaluation, the use of a 2-mm Gaussian filter caused difficulties in diagnosis because the brain parenchymal accumulation was mottled with high image noise. Differences in image quality and diagnostic ability due to different examination times were not significant. Differences in the SUVR were not significant in patients with a negative Alzheimer's disease diagnosis; in patients with a positive diagnosis, the SUVR showed significant fluctuation depending on the acquisition conditions. CONCLUSION The differences in image quality and diagnostic performance due to the differences in 10-min acquisition time were not significant; however, of note, SUVR showed significant fluctuation depending on the acquisition conditions in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.","Otani, Tamaki; Otsuka, Hideki; Matsushita, Kou; Otomi, Yoichi; Kunikane, Yamato; Azane, Shota; Amano, Masafumi; Harada, Masafumi; Miyoshi, Hirokazu",Annals of nuclear medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12149-021-01634-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046870/,697

OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to investigate the PMI rates according to various definitions, their clinically relevant association with all-cause mortality at 10 years, and their impact on composite endpoints at 5 years in the SYNTAXES (Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery Extended Survival) trial. METHODS PMI was classified as a myocardial infarction occurring within 48 h of the procedure according to definitions of the SYNTAX (TAXUS Drug-Eluting Stent Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for the Treatment of Narrowed Arteries), ISCHEMIA (International Study Of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical And Invasive Approaches), and EXCEL (Evaluation of XIENCE versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization) trials; the Fourth Universal Definition of MI; and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI). Of the 1,800 patients enrolled, 1,652 with creatine kinase and/or creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) post-procedure were included. The association between PMI and mortality was analyzed by Cox regression. RESULTS PMI rates according to the SYNTAX and Fourth Universal Definition of MI, both of which required CK-MB elevation and electrocardiographic evidence of permanent myocardial damage, were 2.7% and 3.0%, respectively, in the PCI arm versus 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively, in the CABG arm. PMI rates according to the SCAI or EXCEL definition were higher in the PCI (5.7%) and CABG (16.5%) arms. PMIs according to the SYNTAX and Fourth Universal Definition of MI were more strongly associated with mortality than EXCEL and SCAI PMIs defined by isolated enzyme elevation when CK-MB was more than 10 times ULN. The impact of these ""enzyme-driven events"" on time-to-event curves and the composite endpoints was greater in the surgical cohort. PMIs after PCI were associated with 10-year mortality regardless of definition, whereas their impact on mortality after CABG was limited to 1 year. CONCLUSIONS The rates of PMI are highly dependent on their definition, which affects time-to-event curves, composite endpoints, and their lethal prognostic relevance.

99502,Pandemics and education: A historical review.,2021-04-19,"Theories of memory consolidation suggest that initially rich, vivid memories become more gist-like over time. However, it is unclear whether gist-like representations reflect a loss of detail through degradation or the blending of experiences into statistical averages, and whether the strength of these representations increases, decreases, or remains stable over time. We report three behavioral experiments that address these questions by examining distributional learning during spatial navigation. In Experiment 1, human subjects navigated a virtual maze to find hidden objects with locations varying according to spatial distributions. After 15 minutes, 1 day, 7 days, or 28 days, we tested their navigation performance and explicit memory. In Experiment 2, we created spatial distributions with no object at their mean locations, thereby disentangling learned object exemplars from statistical averages. In Experiment 3, we created only a single, bimodal distribution to avoid possible confusion between distributions and administered tests after 15 minutes or 28 days. Across all experiments, and for both navigation and explicit tests, representations of the spatial distributions were present soon after exposure, but then receded over time. These findings suggest gist-like representations do not improve over time, helping to clarify the temporal dynamics of consolidation in human learning and memory.

However, the underlying physiology of these TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) is still heavily underexplored, impeding a broad application of TEPs to study pathology in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we tested the effects of a single oral dose of three antiepileptic drugs with specific modes of action (carbamazepine, a voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) blocker; brivaracetam, a ligand to the presynaptic vesicle protein VSA2; tiagabine, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reuptake inhibitor) on TEP amplitudes in 15 healthy adults in a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled crossover design. We found that carbamazepine decreased the P25 and P180 TEP components, and brivaracetam the N100 amplitude in the nonstimulated hemisphere, while tiagabine had no effect. Findings corroborate the view that the P25 represents axonal excitability of the corticospinal system, the N100 in the nonstimulated hemisphere propagated activity suppressed by inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter release, and the P180 late activity particularly sensitive to VGSC blockade. Pharmaco-physiological characterization of TEPs will facilitate utilization of TMS-EEG in neuropsychiatric disorders with altered excitability and/or network connectivity.","Darmani, Ghazaleh; Bergmann, Til O; Zipser, Carl; Baur, David; Müller-Dahlhaus, Florian; Ziemann, Ulf",Human brain mapping,https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30549127/,697

A growing body of evidence suggests that low expression of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) promotes the transmission of α-synuclein (α-Syn) interpolymers and the progression of PD. However, how GBA mutations affect the pathogenesis of PD via abnormal aggregation of α-Syn is unclear, and no clinically valid PD-MCI genetic markers have been identified. Here, we first located a GBA eQTL, rs12411216, by analysing DHS, eQTL SNP, and transcription factor binding site data using the UCSC database. Subsequently, we found that rs12411216 was significantly associated with PD-MCI (P < 0.05) in 306 PD patients by genotyping. In exploring the relationship between rs12411216 and GBA expression, the SNP was found to be associated with GBA expression in 50 PD patients through qPCR verification. In a further CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing module, the SNP was identified to cause a decrease in GBA expression, weaken enzymatic activity and enhance the abnormal aggregation of α-Syn in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we confirmed that the binding efficiency of transcription factor E2F4 was affected by the rs12411216 SNP. In conclusion, our results showed that rs12411216 regulated GBA expression, supporting its potential role as a PD-MCI genetic biomarker and highlighting novel mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease.","Jiang, Zhiqiang; Huang, Yilin; Zhang, Piao; Han, Chongyin; Lu, Yueer; Mo, Zongchao; Zhang, Zhanyu; Li, Xin; Zhao, Sisi; Cai, Fuqiang; Huang, Lizhen; Chen, Chunbo; Shi, Zhihong; Zhang, Yuhu; Ling, Fei",Molecular brain,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13041-020-00637-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32641146/,697

MATERIAL AND METHODS Data on patients who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with a diagnosis of morbid obesity between January 2012 and June 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were compared in terms of age, sex, body mass index, duration of operation, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, perioperative complications, length of hospital stay, and long term follow-up results. RESULTS During the study period, 91 patients (45 laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 46 laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy) underwent bariatric surgery. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of preoperative patient characteristics. Both groups showed statistically significant weight loss and improvement in co-morbidities when compared with the preoperative period. Weight loss and improvement in metabolic parameters were similar in both groups. The duration of operation and hospital stay was longer in the laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group. Furthermore, the rate of total complications was significantly lower in the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy group. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a safe and effective method with a significantly lower complication rate and length of hospital stay than laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, with similar improvement rates in metabolic syndrome.","Kafalı, Mehmet Ertuğrul; Şahin, Mustafa; Ece, İlhan; Acar, Fahrettin; Yılmaz, Hüseyin; Alptekin, Hüsnü; Ateş, Leyla",Turkish journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.5152/turkjsurg.2017.3865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28944323/,697

An iterative estimating procedure combining the maximum likelihood estimation and a generalized method of moments is provided. A Quandt Likelihood Ratio test for detecting structural breaks in $ PM_{10} $ data, in the period from 1st January 2020 to 8th July 2020 which includes the first lockdown due to Covid pandemic, confirms the presence of time-changes. These results show that the lockdown made the air once again cleaner.

CoVID-19 arrived and acted as an unexpected experiment in nature, catalyzing telemedicine's widespread implementation across many disciplines of medicine. The arrival of CoVID-19 in Ireland gave us the opportunity to record these perceptions pre- and post-CoVID. Data were extracted from the National Epilepsy Electronic Patient Record (EEPR). Power BI Analytics collated data from two epilepsy centers in Dublin. Analysis of data on reasons for using the telephone support line was conducted. A subset of patients and clinicians who attended virtual encounters over both periods were asked for their perception of telemedicine care through a mixed methods survey. Between 23rd December 2019 and 23rd March 2020 (pre-CoVID era), a total of 1180 patients were seen in 1653 clinical encounters. As part of a telemedicine pilot study, 50 of these encounters were scheduled virtual telephone appointments. Twenty eight surveys were completed by clinicians and 18 by patients during that period. From 24th March 2020 to 24th June 2020, 1164 patients were seen in 1693 encounters of which 729 (63%) patients were seen in 748 scheduled virtual encounters. 118 clinician impressions were captured through an online survey and 75 patients or carers completed a telephone survey during the post-CoVID era. There was no backlog of appointments or loss of care continuity forced by the pandemic. Clinicians expressed strong levels of satisfaction, but some doubted the suitability of new patients to the service or candidates for surgery receiving care via telemedicine. Patients reported positive experiences surrounding telephone appointments comparing them favorably to face-to-face encounters. The availability of a shared EEPR demonstrated no loss of care contact for patients with epilepsy. The survey showed that telemedicine is seen as an effective and satisfactory method of delivering chronic outpatient care.","Banks, Jack; Corrigan, Derek; Grogan, Roger; El-Naggar, Hany; White, Máire; Doran, Elisabeth; Synnott, Cara; Fitzsimons, Mary; Delanty, Norman; Doherty, Colin P",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33342712/,697

While the influenza virus is a known contributor to human morbidity and mortality, the question of how a coinfection between COVID-19 and influenza might manifest is of utmost concern. The aim of this study was to review the limited cases of COVID-19/influenza coinfection currently available in the literature, along with cases in the community of El Paso, Texas, to determine whether any patterns of clinical presentation and morbidity emerged. An international review of the literature was conducted. Six published articles describing COVID-19/influenza coinfection were identified, with a total of thirteen patients described therein. Three additional patients were identified from the El Paso, Texas data. The most common presenting symptoms were fever and cough. The most common laboratory findings were elevated C-reactive protein and lymphocytopenia. Thirteen patients presented with viral pneumonia findings on CT, and nine had findings of ground-glass opacity. Finally, complications were reported in six patients, with most common complication being acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The results of the review indicate that, due to the similarity in presentation between COVID-19 and influenza, further analysis will be required to understand the effects of coinfection on morbidity and mortality. However, the limited number of coinfection cases in the literature indicates that the implementation of COVID-19 control measures may continue to play a role in limiting the spread of these human respiratory pathogens.

115439,Foreign body reaction from anti-adhesion material during follow-up of gynaecological malignancies: Mimicking local recurrence.,2016,"INTRODUCTION: Endotracheal (ET) intubation is a common cause of acquired glottic stenosis. Severe cases often require an irreversible arytenoidectomy/cordectomy, which typically results in poor voice quality. Adult human cadaver larynges were studied to gain insights about ET tube-induced posterior glottic injuries, hoping to create a less invasive remedy. STUDY DESIGN: Human cadaver investigation and case reports. METHODS: Microlaryngeal assessments were done on 10 human cadaver larynges (5 men, 5 women) with and without ET tubes. After supracricoid soft tissue resection, measurements were obtained, including the distance between the outer diameter of the ET tube and the medial aspect of the cricoarytenoid joint facet. Additionally, measurements of the circumferential arc of differently sized ET tubes were made alongside both cricoarytenoid joint capsules. This information was used to design a silastic stent that would function as a self-retaining interarytenoid spring to treat posterior glottic stenosis in 5 patients. Four of 5 patients included in the clinical study were tracheotomy dependent, primarily because of glottic stenosis. The human surgical technique is described in detail. RESULTS: The shortest distance between the outer diameter of the ET tube to the medial cricoid facet averaged 5.02 mm in men and 3.62 mm in women. On the basis of the diameter of the intralaryngeal component of the initially round stent, and the position of the cricoarytenoid joint facets, the interarytenoid spring would have a subtended arc between 110° and 175°. These data helped fashion parameters for modifying a conventional T-tube to form a new self-retaining silastic interarytenoid spring. The first 5 human cases have been successful, allowing effective tracheotomy tube decannulation and excellent voice quality. CONCLUSIONS: The anatomic investigation herein provided key insights into ET tube-induced glottic stenosis and facilitated a new straightforward procedure to surgically improve the airway yet preserve excellent vocal function in patients with acquired glottic stenosis.

METHODS Twelve subjects performed 2 min of strenuous isometric handgrip (IHG) exercise at 40% maximum voluntary contraction to elevate forearm muscle lactic acid. Forearm blood flow (FBF; Doppler and Echo ultrasound of the brachial artery) and deep venous forearm blood lactate and H+ concentration ([La-], [H+]) were measured every minute for 10 min post-IHG under three conditions: passive (passive rest), active (rhythmic exercise at 10% maximum voluntary contraction), and massage (effleurage and pétrissage). Arterialized [La-] and [H+] from a superficial heated hand vein was measured at baseline. RESULTS Data are presented as mean +/- SE. Venoarterial [La-] difference ([La-]v-a) at 30 s of post-IHG was the same across conditions (passive = 6.1 +/- 0.6 mmol x L(-1), active = 5.7 +/- 0.6 mmol x L(-1), massage = 5.5 +/- 0.6 mmol x L(-1), NS), whereas FBF was greater in passive (766 +/- 101 mL x min(-1)) versus active (614 +/- 62 mL x min(-1), P = 0.003) versus massage (540 +/- 60 mL x min(-1), P < 0.0001). Total FBF area under the curve (AUC) for 10 min after handgrip was significantly higher in passive versus massage (4203 +/- 531 vs 3178 +/- 304 mL, P = 0.024) but not versus active (3584 +/- 284 mL, P = 0.217). La(-)- efflux (FBF x [La-]v-a) AUC mirrored FBF AUC (passive = 20.5 +/- 2.8 mmol vs massage = 14.7 +/- 1.6 mmol, P = 0.03, vs active = 15.4 +/- 1.9 mmol, P = 0.064). H+ efflux (FBF x [H+]v-a) was greater in passive versus massage at 30 s (2.2 +/- 0.4e(-5) vs 1.3 +/- 0.2e(-5) mmol, P < 0.001) and 1.5 min (1.0 +/- 0.2e(-5) vs 0.6 +/- 0.09e(-5) mmol, P = 0.003) after IHG.

Considering the elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in COVID-19, it is suggested that cytokine storms play a critical role in its pathogenesis, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, there is no specific drug for preventing the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) caused by COVID-19. Indeed, interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been highlighted for its many biological functions, such as immune regulation, inflammatory response, and metabolism. Therapeutic blockade of the IL-6 signaling pathway is expected to reduce the excessive immune reponse observed in COVID-19. Currently, the IL-6 receptor antagonists tocilizumab and sarilumab, have been adopted for preventing CRS during the progression of COVID-19, and remarkable beneficial effects were observed by using these humanized monoclonal antibodies. Based on the pathogenesis of COVID-19, we reviewed the biological mechanism of IL-6 blockade in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and evaluated its clinical applications.","Wang, Yao; Liu, Chen; Miao, Xiaolong; Kong, Deqiang; Zhao, Yingli; Gong, Weihua; Ding, Xianfeng",European cytokine network,https://doi.org/10.1684/ecn.2020.0453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33270024/,697

Racial/ethnic disparities in early-onset CRC have also grown more pronounced, because Black individuals have higher early-onset CRC incidence and poorer survival compared with White individuals. We describe the prevalence and burden of early-onset CRC among Africans in Nigeria and African Americans (AAs) in the United States. PATIENTS AND METHODS We identified Black individuals diagnosed with a first primary CRC ages 18 to 49 years between 1989 and 2017 at Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital in Zaria, Nigeria (Nigerians), and in the United States (AAs) using the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute's SEER program of cancer registries. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate clinical and demographic differences between Nigerians and AAs with early-onset CRC, adjusted for age, sex, tumor site, and histology. RESULTS A total of 5,019 Black individuals were diagnosed with early-onset CRC over the study period (379 Nigerians; 4,640 AAs). Overall, approximately one third of young Black patients were diagnosed with rectal tumors (35.8%). Nigerian individuals with early-onset CRC were eight-fold more likely to be diagnosed with rectal tumors (odds ratio [OR], 8.14; 95% CI, 6.23 to 10.62; P < .0001) and more likely to be diagnosed at younger ages (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.89; P < .0001) compared with young African Americans in adjusted models. CONCLUSION Compared with AA individuals diagnosed with early-onset CRC, Nigerian individuals harbor distinct features of early-onset CRC. Additional investigation of the histopathologic and biologic heterogeneity of early-onset CRCs among Black individuals is critical for understanding racial disparities in susceptibility and outcomes, which may have implications for tailored early-onset CRC prevention, detection, and treatment strategies.","Holowatyj, Andreana N; Maude, Aishatu Suleiman; Musa, Halimatu Sadiya; Adamu, Ahmed; Ibrahim, Sani; Abdullahi, Adamu; Manko, Muhammad; Aminu, Sirajo Mohammed; Mohammed, Abdullahi; Idoko, John; Ukwenya, Yahaya; Carpten, John; Chandler, Paulette D; Hampel, Heather; Faruk, Mohammed",JCO global oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/go.20.00272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141623/,697

128786,David Oliver: Preventing more deaths in care homes in a second pandemic surge.,2020-06-23,"Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that neuro-immune interactions impact nervous system function in both homeostatic and pathologic conditions. A well-studied function of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) is the presentation of cell-derived peptides to the adaptive immune system, particularly in response to infection. More recently it has been shown that the expression of MHCI molecules on neurons can modulate activity-dependent changes in the synaptic connectivity during normal development and neurologic disorders. The importance of these functions to the brain health supports the need for a sensitive assay that readily detects MHCI expression on neurons. Here we describe a method for primary culture of murine hippocampal neurons and then assessment of MHCI expression by flow cytometric analysis. Murine hippocampus is microdissected from prenatal mouse pups at the embryonic day 18. Tissue is dissociated into a single cell suspension using enzymatic and mechanical techniques, then cultured in a serum-free media that limits growth of non-neuronal cells. After 7 days in vitro, MHCI expression is stimulated by treating cultured cells pharmacologically with beta interferon. MHCI molecules are labeled in situ with a fluorescently tagged antibody, then cells are non-enzymatically dissociated into a single cell suspension. To confirm the neuronal identity, cells are fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and labeled with a fluorescently tagged antibody that recognizes neuronal nuclear antigen NeuN. MHCI expression is then quantified on neurons by flow cytometric analysis. Neuronal cultures can easily be manipulated by either genetic modifications or pharmacologic interventions to test specific hypotheses. With slight modifications, these methods can be used to culture other neuronal populations or to assess expression of other proteins of interest.","Funk, Kristen E; Lotz, Sarah K",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/61436; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32510500/,697

There is no solid evidence regarding the efficiency of universal screening by PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. The present study aimed to assess the usefulness of clinical screening and universal pre-procedure PCR testing for the identification of patients capable of transmitting the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Concordance between both strategies was also evaluated. METHOD A retrospective review was conducted in a consecutive cohort of patients undergoing endoscopy at a tertiary teaching hospital between 22nd April and 22nd June 2020, following a screening protocol. RESULTS Three hundred and sixty-one patients were included. Clinical screening detected 13 patients with a high risk of infection (3.6%, 95% CI 2.62-4.58) while the pre-procedure PCR test was positive in five patients (1.40% 95% CI 0.20-2.60). Three patients developed COVID-19 and one died from the disease. Agreement between both strategies was poor, with a Kappa value of 0.093 (95% CI 0.001-0.185). Clinical screening only identified one of the five patients with a positive PCR test.

132255,COVID-19: Implications for Supply Chain Management.,2020,"INTRODUCTION Anesthesia during pregnancy can impair fetal neurodevelopment, but effects of surgery remain unknown. The aim is to investigate effects of abdominal surgery on fetal brain development. Hypothesis is that surgery impairs outcome. METHODS Pregnant rabbits were randomized at 28 days of gestation to 2 h of general anesthesia (sevoflurane group, n = 6) or to anesthesia plus laparoscopic appendectomy (surgery group, n = 13). On postnatal day 1, neurobehavior of pups was assessed and brains harvested. Primary outcome was neuron density in the frontal cortex, and secondary outcomes included neurobehavioral assessment and other histological parameters. RESULTS Fetal survival was lower in the surgery group: 54 versus 100% litters alive at birth (p = 0.0442). In alive litters, pup survival until harvesting was 50 versus 69% (p = 0.0352). No differences were observed for primary outcome (p = 0.5114) for surviving pups. Neuron densities were significantly lower in the surgery group in the caudate nucleus (p = 0.0180), but not different in other regions. No differences were observed for secondary outcomes. Conclusions did not change after adjustment for mortality. CONCLUSION Abdominal surgery in pregnant rabbits at a gestational age corresponding to the end of human second trimester results in limited neurohistological changes but not in neurobehavioral impairments. High intrauterine mortality limits translation to clinical scenario, where fetal mortality is close to zero.","Bleeser, Tom; Van Der Veeken, Lennart; Devroe, Sarah; Vergote, Simen; Emam, Doaa; van der Merwe, Johannes; Ghijsens, Elina; Joyeux, Luc; Basurto, David; Van de Velde, Marc; Deprest, Jan; Rex, Steffen",Fetal diagnosis and therapy,https://doi.org/10.1159/000512489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33631746/,697

133688,Teaching Tip: Designing Flipped Classrooms to Enhance Learning in the Clinical Skills Laboratory.,2021-07-28,"Pharmacological efficiency of active compounds is largely determined by their membrane permeability. Thus, identification of drug-membrane interactions seems to be a crucial element determining drug-like properties of chemical agents. Yet, knowledge of this issue is still lacking. Since chemoprevention based on natural compounds such as cinnamic acid (CinA), p-coumaric acid (p-CoA) and ferulic (FA) is becoming a strong trend in modern oncopharmacology, determination of physicochemical properties of these anticancer compounds is highly important. Here, electrophoretic light scattering and impedance spectroscopy were applied to study the effects of these phenolic acids on electrical properties of bilayers formed from 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (PS) or DOPC-PS mixture. After phenolic acid treatment, the negative charge of membranes increased in alkaline pH solutions, but not in acidic ones. The impedance data showed elevated values of both the electrical capacitance and the electrical resistance. We concluded that at acidic pH all tested compounds were able to solubilize into the membrane and permeate it. At neutral and alkaline pH, the CinA could be partially inserted into the bilayers, whereas p-CoA and FA could be anchored at the bilayer surface. Our results indicate that the electrochemical methods might be crucial for predicting pharmacological activity and bioavailability of phenolic acids.","Naumowicz, Monika; Zając, Marcin; Kusaczuk, Magdalena; Gál, Miroslav; Kotyńska, Joanna",Membranes,https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes10110343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33203075/,697

134944,Editorial: Affective Learning in Digital Education.,2020,"Conservation physiology aims to apply an understanding of physiological mechanisms to management of imperiled species, populations, or ecosystems. One challenge for physiologists hoping to apply their expertise to conservation is connecting the mechanisms we study, often in the laboratory, with the vital rates of populations in the wild. There is growing appreciation that infectious pathogens can threaten populations and species, and represent an important issue for conservation. Conservation physiology has much to offer in terms of addressing the threat posed to some host species by infectious pathogens. At the same time, the well-developed theoretical framework of disease ecology could provide a model to help advance the application of physiology to a range of other conservation issues. Here, I use white-nose syndrome (WNS) in hibernating North American bats as an example of a conservation problem for which integrative physiological research has been a critical part of research and management. The response to WNS highlights the importance of a well-developed theoretical framework for the application of conservation physiology to a particular threat. I review what is known about physiological mechanisms associated with mortality from WNS and emphasize the value of combining a strong theoretical background with integrative physiological studies in order to connect physiological mechanisms with population processes and thereby maximize the potential benefits of conservation physiology.","Willis, Craig K R",Integrative and comparative biology,https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icv099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26307096/,697
135447,The Need for Nutritional Education Reform in US Medical Education System.,2020-12-09,"BACKGROUND Migraine with aura is independently associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, especially in younger subjects. This association might be related to an impairment of cerebral autoregulation, which normally maintains cerebral blood flow independent of arterial blood pressure variations. METHODS Patients aged 30-55, fulfilling ICHD-3 beta criteria for migraine with aura, were prospectively enrolled and compared with gender- and age-matched healthy controls without a history of migraine. Patients and controls with a history of stroke or any disease potentially impairing cerebral autoregulation were excluded. We assessed cerebral autoregulation with two different methods: Transfer function analysis, and the correlation coefficient index Mx. The transfer function phase and gain reflect responses of cerebral blood flow velocities to relatively fast fluctuations of arterial blood pressure, whereas Mx also reflects responses to slower arterial blood pressure fluctuations. RESULTS A total of 22 migraine with aura patients (median age [IQR]: 39.5 [12.5] years) and 22 controls (39 [9.75] years) were included. Transfer function parameters and Mx were not different between patients and controls. However, Mx was inversely correlated with age in patients (ρ = -0.567, p = 0.006) and not in controls (ρ = -0.084, p = 0.509). Mx was also inversely correlated with migraine with aura duration (ρ = -0.617, p = 0.002), suggesting improvement of cerebral autoregulation efficiency with disease duration. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral autoregulation did not differ between patients and controls aged 30-55. However, cerebral autoregulation efficiency was strongly correlated with migraine with aura duration. Further studies in younger patients are needed to determine whether cerebral autoregulation is impaired early in the course of disease.

142666,How do laypeople define empathy?,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Currently there is no accepted standard of practice for the optimal frequency of endotracheal tube cuff pressure monitoring in mechanically ventilated patients. Therefore, we conducted a study to compare infrequent endotracheal tube cuff pressure monitoring (immediately after intubation and when clinically indicated for an observed air leak or due to tube migration) with frequent endotracheal tube cuff pressure monitoring (immediately after intubation, every 8 h, and when clinically indicated). METHODS We performed a prospective clinical trial with subjects assigned to study groups based on room assignment. The primary outcome was the occurrence of a ventilator-associated event (VAE) and was adjudicated by individuals blinded to the conduct of this study. RESULTS We enrolled 305 subjects, with 166 (54.4%) assigned to frequent monitoring and 139 (45.6%) assigned to infrequent monitoring. The total number of endotracheal tube cuff pressure monitoring events for both groups was 1,531 versus 336, respectively. The occurrence of VAEs was infrequent and similar for both groups (3.6% vs 5.8%, P = .37). Witnessed aspiration events (0.6% vs 0%, P = .36), ventilator-associated pneumonia (0% vs 0.7%, P = .27), 30-d mortality (31.3% vs 30.2%, P = .83), and hospital length of stay (10 d [6 d, 21 d] vs 11 d [6 d, 21 d], P = .34) were also similar for both study groups. The 30-d hospital readmission rate was statistically lower for the group that received infrequent monitoring (15.1% vs 6.5%, P = .02). CONCLUSIONS More frequent cuff pressure monitoring was not associated with any identifiable clinical outcome benefit.","Letvin, Adam; Kremer, Pamala; Silver, Patty C; Samih, Nizama; Reed-Watts, Peggy; Kollef, Marin H",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.05926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29382793/,697
143537,COVID-19: a wreak havoc across the globe.,2020-07-30,"Dear Editor, the number of people living with diagnosed HIV (PLWHIV) is growing older and diversifying. In 2017, 98% of people receiving HIV care in the UK were on antiretroviral treatment and of those, 97% had an undetectable viral load (uVL). There is consensus that HIV with an uVL is not infectious. A minority of PLWHIV have a detectable viral load, however, almost always, HIV tends to be transmitted by undiagnosed individuals. An accepted custom has been for histopathology samples from PLWHIV to be processed differently from those without known HIV infection to mitigate the risk of transmission to clinical and laboratory staff. Recent personal communication with 25 different Mohs centres in the UK highlighted a diverse range of practice; 44% performed conventional frozen-section Mohs surgery on PLWHIV with an uVL, with the remainder using ""slow Mohs"" surgery with formalin-fixed sections for all PLWHIV regardless of viral load status. Our findings of practice in this regard, are similar to those reported in the USA.","Alani, A; Allstaff, S; Yirell, D; Topping, D; Affleck, A",Clinical and experimental dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ced.14367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32621299/,697

It is controversial whether the virus can be transmitted via tears and its ocular implications have not been widely studied. In this article, the current evidence related to ocular transmission and ocular manifestations is reviewed. RESULTS Several mechanisms for the ocular transmission of the virus are proposed with highlight on the nasolacrimal system as a conduit between the eye and the respiratory tract, and the role of the lacrimal gland in hematogenous spread. Ocular surface manifestations such as conjunctivitis are more commonly reported. CONCLUSION The exact pathophysiology of ocular transmission of the virus remains incompletely understood, although there is preliminary evidence of SARS-CoV-2 being detected in ocular secretions. The ocular tropism of the virus and its potential to cause localized ocular disease are worth considering.","Ho, Dawn; Low, Rebecca; Tong, Louis; Gupta, Vishali; Veeraraghavan, Aravamudan; Agrawal, Rupesh",Ocular immunology and inflammation,https://doi.org/10.1080/09273948.2020.1772313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32543262/,697

146368,Let's get back to work: Preventive biological cycle management of the coronavirus in the workplace.,2020-08-18,"BACKGROUND Globally, about 50 million people were living with dementia in 2015, with this number projected to triple by 2050. With no cure or effective treatment currently insight, it is vital that factors are identified which will help prevent or delay both age-related and pathological cognitive decline and dementia. Observational data have suggested that hearing loss is a potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia, but no conclusive evidence from randomised controlled trials is currently available. METHODS The HearCog trial is a 24-month, randomised, controlled clinical trial aimed at determining whether a hearing loss intervention can delay or arrest the cognitive decline. We will randomise 180 older adults with hearing loss and mild cognitive impairment to a hearing aid or control group to determine if the fitting of hearing aids decreases the 12-month rate of cognitive decline compared with the control group. In addition, we will also determine if the expected clinical gains achieved after 12 months can be sustained over an additional 12 months and if losses experienced through the non-correction of hearing loss can be reversed with the fitting of hearing aids after 12 months. DISCUSSION The trial will also explore the cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared to the control arm and the impact of hearing aids on anxiety, depression, physical health and quality of life. The results of this trial will clarify whether the systematic correction of hearing loss benefits cognition in older adults at risk of cognitive decline. We anticipate that our findings will have implications for clinical practice and health policy development.

146859,"A Learner-led, Discussion-based Elective on Emerging Infectious Disease.",2015,"Scientific research aims to bring forward innovative ideas and constantly challenges existing knowledge structures and stereotypes. However, women, ethnic and cultural minorities, as well as individuals with disabilities, are systematically discriminated against or even excluded from promotions, publications, and general visibility. A more diverse workforce is more productive, and thus discrimination has a negative impact on science and the wider society, as well as on the education, careers, and well-being of individuals who are discriminated against. Moreover, the lack of diversity at scientific gatherings can lead to micro-aggressions or harassment, making such meetings unpleasant, or even unsafe environments for early career and underrepresented scientists. At the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM), we recognized the need for promoting underrepresented scientists and creating diverse role models in the field of neuroimaging. To foster this, the OHBM has created a Diversity and Inclusivity Committee (DIC). In this article, we review the composition and activities of the DIC that have promoted diversity within OHBM, in order to inspire other organizations to implement similar initiatives. Activities of the committee over the past four years have included (a) creating a code of conduct, (b) providing diversity and inclusivity education for OHBM members, (c) organizing interviews and symposia on diversity issues, and (d) organizing family-friendly activities and providing childcare grants during the OHBM annual meetings. We strongly believe that these activities have brought positive change within the wider OHBM community, improving inclusivity and fostering diversity while promoting rigorous, ground-breaking science. These positive changes could not have been so rapidly implemented without the enthusiastic support from the leadership, including OHBM Council and Program Committee, and the OHBM Special Interest Groups (SIGs), namely the Open Science, Student and Postdoc, and Brain-Art SIGs. Nevertheless, there remains ample room for improvement, in all areas, and even more so in the area of targeted attempts to increase inclusivity for women, individuals with disabilities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, racial/ethnic minorities, and individuals of lower socioeconomic status or from low and middle-income countries. Here, we present an overview of the DIC's composition, its activities, future directions and challenges. Our goal is to share our experiences with a wider audience to provide information to other organizations and institutions wishing to implement similar comprehensive diversity initiatives. We propose that scientific organizations can push the boundaries of scientific progress only by moving beyond existing power structures and by integrating principles of equity and inclusivity in their core values.","Tzovara, Athina; Amarreh, Ishmael; Borghesani, Valentina; Chakravarty, M Mallar; DuPre, Elizabeth; Grefkes, Christian; Haugg, Amelie; Jollans, Lee; Lee, Hyang Woon; Newman, Sharlene D; Olsen, Rosanna K; Ratnanather, J Tilak; Rippon, Gina; Uddin, Lucina Q; Vega, Maria L Bringas; Veldsman, Michele; White, Tonya; Badhwar, AmanPreet",NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33454405/,697

Diagnosis is best by a good upper GI exam though upper endoscopy should be performed as well. Treatment is either by open, transcervical approaches or trans-oral. Over the past 20 years, transoral approach has mostly replace transcervical approaches due to less pain, no scarring and a rapid recovery. Transoral approaches are either using rigid access or flexible endoscopy. Today, the most common approach is transoral stapling using a 12 mm laparoscopic linear cutting stapler. This has the drawbacks of requiring extreme neck extension, the massive size of the stapler making visualization mostly impossible and the current staple design that does not cut/staple all the way to the end of the blades-resulting in a residual pouch. Flexible endoscopy allows a more tailored approach under direct vision, the myotomy can even be extended beyond the diverticulum and onto the esophageal wall to minimize the risk of incomplete myotomy. Experienced endoscopists report high technical success and low complication. Success rates are similar but maybe slightly higher than with ridged transoral approaches or open surgery. Today, flexible endoscopic Zenkers is our preferred initial approach-with open or ridged being reserved for special indications.","Beard, Kristen; Swanström, Lee L",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2017.03.133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28446979/,697

This report evaluates the safety and effectiveness of the technique and presents the long-term results of hybrid, Y-configured, dual stent-assisted coil embolization in the treatment of wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms. We retrospectively evaluated the patients treated endovascularly due to cerebral aneurysms. Twenty patients treated with hybrid Y-stent-assisted coil embolization were enrolled in the study. In hybrid stenting, an open-cell intracranial stent (Neuroform) was used as a first stent to prevent stent migration. A closed-cell stent (Enterprise or Acclino) was used as a second stent and the aneurysm was embolized with coils between the stent struts. In all patients, hybrid Y-stenting and coil embolization were accomplished successfully. No stent migration occurred. Clinically, neither symptomatic neurologic complication nor death was seen. Of 20 wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms, nine were at the basilar tip, while seven were at the middle cerebral artery and three at the anterior communicating artery. In one patient, the aneurysm was at the A2-3 junction of the anterior cerebral artery. One of the patients had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The mean angiographic follow-up was 25.6 months. No in-stent stenosis was seen in any of the patients and recanalization in only one. Hybrid, Y-configured, dual stent-assisted coil embolization is a safe and effective method in the treatment of wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms to prevent stent migration and aneurysm recanalization, and is a viable alternative to microsurgery.","Akgul, Erol; Balli, Tugsan; Aksungur, Erol H","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019915575436; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25934772/,697

DATA SOURCES MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Elsevier), Web of Science (Clarivate), and the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (EBSCO). REVIEW METHODS A systematic review was reported in concordance with the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses). Articles on children with hearing loss who underwent at least 1 instrumented measure of vestibular function and had gross motor milestones assessed were included. The Downs and Black checklist was used to assess risk of bias and methodological quality. RESULTS Eleven articles were included in the systematic review. Three articles stratified quantitative results of gross motor milestone acquisition by severity of vestibular impairment. Over half of studies were case series published within the last 5 years. This systematic review showed that children with hearing loss and severe, bilateral vestibular dysfunction demonstrate delayed gross motor milestones. However, it was difficult to draw conclusions on whether milder forms of vestibular dysfunction significantly affect gross motor milestone acquisition in children with hearing loss. The reason is that most studies were of low to moderate quality, used different assessment methods, and contained results that were descriptive in nature. CONCLUSIONS This emerging area would benefit from future research, such as higher-quality studies to assess vestibular function and gross motor milestones. This would allow for better characterization of the impacts of vestibular impairment, especially milder forms, in children with hearing loss.","Singh, Anisha; Raynor, Eileen M; Lee, Janet W; Smith, Sherri L; Heet, Hannah; Garrison, Doug; Wrigley, Jordan; Kaylie, David M; Riska, Kristal M",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820983726; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33430703/,697

154743,Prevalence and impact of high platelet reactivity in chronic kidney disease: results from the Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy with Drug-Eluting Stents registry.,2015,"Mitral valve repair with annuloplasty is often favoured over total valve replacement. In order to develop and optimize new annuloplasty ring designs, it is important to study the complex biomechanical behaviour of the valve annulus and the subvalvular apparatus with simultaneous in- and out-of-plane restraining force measurements. A new flat D-shaped mitral valve annular force transducer was developed. The transducer was mounted with strain gauges to measure strain and calibrated to provide simultaneous restraining forces in- and out of the mitral annular plane. The force transducer was implanted and evaluated in an 80 kg porcine experimental model. Accumulation of out-of-plane restraining forces, creating strain in the anterior segment were 0.7 ± 0.0 N (towards apex) and an average force accumulation of 1.5 ± 0.3 N, creating strain in the commissural segments (away from apex). The accumulations of in-plane restraining forces, creating strain on the inner side of the ring were 1.7 ± 0.2 N (away from ring center). A new mitral annular force transducer was successfully developed and evaluated in vivo. The transducer was able to measure forces simultaneously in different planes. Initial indications point towards overall agreement with previous individual force measurements in- and out-of the mitral annular plane. This can provide more detailed insight into the annular force distribution, and could potentially improve the level of evidence based mitral valve repair and support the development of future mitral annuloplasty devices.","Skov, Søren N; Røpcke, Diana M; Telling, Kristine; Ilkjær, Christine; Tjørnild, Marcell J; Nygaard, Hans; Nielsen, Sten L; Jensen, Morten O",Cardiovascular engineering and technology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13239-015-0227-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26577234/,697

Methods We retrospectively reviewed SCA and classified them into 2 groups: pre-pandemic activations (February 15 to March 10) and Covid-19 pandemic activations (March 11 to April 30). The primary outcome was the ratio of true positive diagnoses of stroke relative to the total number of SCA in the 2 time periods. Results Among the 212 SCA, 83 (39.2%) were from the pre-pandemic period, whereas 129 (60.8%) were from the pandemic period, 147 (69.3%) in the Emergency Department (ED) versus 65 (30.7%) in the inpatient service. In the ED cohort, a rapid decrease in the number of SCA at the beginning of the pandemic was followed by a gradual increase to pre-pandemic levels and a significant increase in the number of true positive strokes over time (44.2% vs 61.1%, p = 0.037). An increase in door-to-CT time (p = 0.001) and an increase in the rate of diagnostic error in patients admitted from the ED (p = 0.016) were also seen. The in-hospital cohort had a sustained decrease in the number of SCA following the pandemic declaration, with no difference in the rate of true positive stroke. Conclusions We observed a rapid decline and slow recovery in ED SCA with a shift toward increased true positive cases following the Covid-19 pandemic. Also, delays in obtaining CT and diagnostic error was increased, however, no difference in early clinical outcomes were seen between groups.","Velez, Faddi G Saleh; Alvarado-Dyer, Ronald; Brutto, Victor J Del; Carrión-Penagos, Julián; Bulwa, Zachary; Prabhakaran, Shyam",The Neurohospitalist,https://doi.org/10.1177/1941874420976517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34163545/,697

162339,We Are More Than Your Paycheck: The Dehumanization of International Students in the United States,2020,"BACKGROUND To avoid injuries in basketball players, they are recommended to pay more attention to improve their body balance. Therefore new training methods and equipment need to be devised. This study examined the effects of an 8-week basketball-specific proprioception training program while using a new developed one plane instability balance board during warm-up for improving balance ability in basketball players. Players who obtained basketball-specific balance training were compared to a control group. METHODS Thirty-one male university basketball players (age: 21.35, SD = 0.605 years; height: 190.97, SD = 1.88; body mass: 86.95, SD = 2.61) participated in this study. Seventeen participants were assigned to the basketball-specific 8-week balance training group (BTG) while 14 participants served as a control group (CG). Both groups were tested with the Y balance test (YBT) and postural stability test (PST) at baseline and 8 weeks later. RESULTS The results indicate significant improvements in the overall YBT for both legs in BTG, but not in CG. However, no group differences were found for dynamic balance performance, but static balance (i.e., postural stability) differed between groups after 8 weeks. A statistically significant moderate inverse correlation was computed between the total score of YBT and the total score of the overall stability index (r=-0.404; p= 0.041). CONCLUSIONS An 8-week basketball-specific proprioception training program with a single-plane instability balance platform improved balance ability (Y balance test and postural stability test) of basketball players.","Domeika, Aurelijus; Slapšinskaitė, Agnė; Razon, Selen; Šiupšinskas, Laimonas; Klizienė, Irina; Dubosienė, Milda",Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine,https://doi.org/10.3233/thc-208002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831212/,697

We aimed to evaluate early and mid-term functional outcomes and complications related to vesicourethral anastomosis (VUA), in patients who underwent RARP, during the initial experience in an academic hospital. We also assessed possible predictors of postoperative incontinence and compared these results with the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS We prospectively collected data from consecutive patients that underwent RARP. Patients with at least 6 months of follow-up were included in the analysis for the following outcomes: time to complete VUA, continence and complications related to anastomosis. Nerve-sparing status, age, BMI, EBL, pathological tumor staging, and prostate size were evaluated as possible factors predicting early and midterm continence. Results were compared with current literature. RESULTS Data from 60 patients was assessed. Mean time to complete VUA was 34 minutes, and console time was 247 minutes. Continence in 6 months was 90%. Incidence of urinary leakage was 3.3%, no patients developed bladder neck contracture or postoperative urinary retention. On multivariate analysis, age and pathological staging was associated to 3-month continence status. CONCLUSION Our data show that, during early experience with RARP in a public university hospital, it is possible to achieve good results regarding continence and other outcomes related to VUA. We also found that age and pathological staging was associated to early continence status.","Burttet, Lucas Medeiros; Varaschin, Gabrielle Aguiar; Berger, Andre Kives; Cavazzola, Leandro Totti; Berger, Milton; Silva, Brasil",International braz j urol : official journal of the Brazilian Society of Urology,https://doi.org/10.1590/s1677-5538.ibju.2016.0466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727367/,697

The pandemic negatively affects economic security, food safety, health, physical, social, and political security components of the human security phenomenon. Hence, combating the pandemic necessitates the simultaneous consideration of health security and all aspects of human security together. The pandemic has brought social life, the health system, and economic life to a standstill in Turkey, similar to the situation almost all around the globe. In Turkey, where the first case was recorded on March 11, 2020, social life measures to limit daily routine were quickly taken to reduce the spread of the pandemic. A new normalization period started at the beginning of June 2020. The fiscal stimulus packages implemented to reduce the impact of the pandemic in Turkey are estimated to be 12.8% of GDP.

Few studies have attempted to understand how facilitation activities are performed to promote the uptake of evidence-based interventions in hospitals from resource-poor countries during crises such as pandemics. This paper aims to explore facilitation activities by infection prevention and control (IPC) professionals in 16 hospitals from 9 states in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach Primary and secondary data were collected between March and December 2020. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 IPC professionals in Brazilian hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Public and internal documents were used for data triangulation. The data were analyzed through thematic analysis technique. Findings Building on the change response theory, this study explores the facilitation activities from the cognitive, behavioral and affective aspects. The facilitation activities are grouped in three overarching dimensions: (1) creating and sustaining legitimacy to continuous and rapid changes, (2) fostering capabilities for continuous changes and (3) accelerating individual commitment. Practical implications During crises such as pandemics, facilitation activities by IPC professionals need to embrace all the cognitive, behavioral and affective aspects to stimulate positive attitudes of frontline workers toward continuous and urgent changes.

Many of these services are not fully-appreciated due to complex environmental dynamics and lack of baseline data. Multicontinental amphibian decline due to the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) provides a stark example. Even though amphibians are known to affect natural food webs---including mosquitoes that transmit human diseases---the human health impacts connected to their massive decline have received little attention. Here we show a causal link between a wave of Bd-driven collapse of amphibians in Central America and increased human malaria incidence. At the canton-level in Costa Rica and district-level in Panama, expected malaria incidence increased for eight years subsequent to amphibian losses, peaking at an additional 1.0 cases per 1,000 population (CPK). The increase is substantial in comparison to annual incidence levels from outbreaks in these countries, which peaked at 1.1-1.5 CPK during our period of study from 1976-2016. This pattern holds across multiple alternative approaches to the estimation model. This previously unidentified impact of biodiversity loss illustrates the often hidden human welfare costs of conservation failures. These findings also show the importance of mitigating international trade-driven spread of similar emergent pathogens like Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans.","Springborn, M. R.; Weill, J.

For the topic modelling, we compare Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non-negative Matrix Factorization in terms of their applicability to short text documents. The extraction of sentiment is done by the rule-based VADER model. Structural breaks in the relative frequency and daily sentiments of topics over time are identified with the Bai-Perron model. Combining these methods, we provide a valuable and easy to use exploratory tool for social scientists to study the discourse on Twitter over time. Detecting statistically significant shifts in topics over time enables researchers to perform statistical inference and test hypotheses about the discourse on Twitter. The framework is implemented efficiently to ensure that it can be used on average consumer hardware in a reasonable amount of time. A case study with COVID-19 related tweets in the UK is provided.

The COVID-19 has resulted in shutting down all the universities across the globe. Countries like India and Turkey (lower-income countries) are suffering a lot in giving the best classroom practice to their students through online mode. The entire way of teaching-learning has changed drastically, and it is a need of an hour. Research suggests that online learning has been shown to increase retention of information, and take less time, meaning the changes coronavirus have caused might be here to stay. It is therefore important to understand from student’s perspectives about learning online. The paper systematically surveys the perception of learning online for Indian and Turkan students. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this goal, 594 samples of students (from India and Turkey country) have been taken into considerations, and through statistical measures, the results were analyzed. The set of four research questions comprising of effect of study on COVID-19 pandemic, perception of learning online in COVID-19 pandemic, perception of different genders in learning online and perception of Indians over Turkan students in learning online were analyzed through statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation and so on. Findings: The descriptive statistics of various responses across various dimensions (gender, country) reveals that there is no effect in learning online as compared to classroom-based teaching. On the other hand, there is no significant difference in gender and country in learning online. Originality/value: Online learning has become crucial in higher education as far as pandemic situation is concerned. Many higher education institutions across different countries are suffering various problems from student point of view. Middle-income countries who are with limited assets and less advancements in higher education need to adhere to certain guidelines in online learning. This empirical study will help to understand the perception of students in online learning across India and Turkey. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Churi, P.; Mistry, K.; Asad, M.

Nevertheless, the techniques of applied clinical psychology are rarely implemented in this struggle.ObjectivesThe aim was to examine the possibilities of the applied clinical psychology in instructing children and adolescents and in exerting psychological influence on them in order to decrease the incidence.MethodsThe following methods were used: thematic analysis of relevant information on TV and on Russian-speaking internet, interviews with adolescents refusing to wear masks (110 adolescents), observation.Results87% of adolescents are sure that they are “fully informed about the COVID-19.” Moreover, 70% are certain they “will not be infected with COVID-19” and even if they do, they will “have a mild form of the disease.” Such information was widely reproduced in the Russian media and proved by medical statistics. It influenced negatively the attitude of adolescents toward masks, social distancing, etc.Conclusions1) The information concerning COVID-19 requires introduction of the changes based on psychological data. 2) The ways of informing children and adolescents should be carefully analyzed using psychological data. In information for young people, their responsibility, solidarity and empathy toward others should be involved. 3) The situation of COVID-19 may become a space for potential development, this situation may shape respect toward the health of other people. 4) The “situation of test,” which is significant for the self-awareness of adolescents, should be employed as a way to persuade adolescents to follow the health restrictions.","Burlakova, N.; Oleshkevich, V.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.819,697
164319,Keeping students connected and engaged in a wet-lab research experience during a time of social distancing via mobile devices and video conferencing software,2021-10-01,"The long-term monitoring of long-lived animal populations often requires individual identification. For cetacean populations, this identification is mostly based on morphological characters observable from a boat such as shape, spots and cuts of the back, caudal and dorsal fins. This is well suited for species easily displaying their caudal fins, such as the humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae, or those whose skin pigmentation patterns enable individual identification. However, for elusive or shier species such as the sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus, this approach may be more challenging as individuals display a rather uniform skin pigmentation. They also do not show very often their caudal fin that must be photographed perpendicularly to the water surface, vertically and fully emerged, uneasing the individual identification from a boat. Immature sperm whales that usually have a caudal fin without any distinctive marks may sometimes be excluded from photo-identification catalogues. Within the framework of the Maubydick project, focusing on the long-term monitoring of sperm whales in Mauritius, passive underwater observation and video recording were used to identify long-lasting body markers (e.g., sex, ventral white markings, cut outs of fins) to improve individual identification. A catalogue of individual identity cards was developed and 38 individuals were recorded (six adult males, 18 adult females and 14 immatures). This catalogue was used in the field and enabled observers to record some nearly-daily and yearly recaptures. Advantages and disadvantages of this method are presented here. Such catalogues represent a robust baseline for conducting behavioural, genetic and acoustic studies in marine megafauna social species. Benefits of such newly acquired knowledge are of first importance to implement relevant conservation plans in the marine realm.","Véronique, Sarano; François, Sarano; Justine, Girardet; Axel, Preud’homme; Hugues, Vitry; René, Heuzey; Marion, Sarano; Fabienne, Delfour; Hervé, Glotin; Olivier, Adam; Bénédicte, Madon; Jean-Luc, Jung",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.08.433909,697

The analysis is based on an ordered probit econometric model that explains the citizens' support to a major involvement of the EU institutions to control the corona virus pandemic. The dataset is the product of a survey administered to 21804 European citizens about a number of issues about the pandemic in 21 EU countries. The empirical analysis provides conclusive evidence on the determinants that affect the individual shift position of European citizens to a major involvement of the European institutions in the control of the pandemic. Our results show that Portuguese, Greeks, Bulgarians, Italians and Spaniards and males are those more in favour of the EU federalist solution to control the COVID-19 crisis. Years of education and social class are among the variables that do not have any significant effect. Meanwhile, the political support to the national government, the priority given to health vs. economy and, being in favour of limiting individual rights to control the pandemic seem to have a positive effect on EU federalism. Moreover, concerns about being infected by the pandemic, need of the help of others, altruism (helping others), economic loss, and social interaction with others also play a determinant role. Thus, the article contributes to the debate of the attitudes and behaviour that affect the individual position of the citizens who want a shift in authority from the national governments to the federal EU as a link to create more resilient regions during COVID-19.","Martin, J.

With given variables (i.e., velocity, duration, particle size and number of particles, and ambient conditions), the standoff safe distance during coughing, talking, and breathing should be the distance where virus-laden droplets and aerosols do not have significant transmission to another person. However, at a critical distance, the aerosol cloud flux can still be extremely high, which can immediately raise the transmission in a localized area to another person during a static condition. In this study, computational fluid dynamics analysis of selective respiratory actions has been carried out to investigate the effect of the standoff distance and assess the importance of social distancing in indoor places. The prediction of the aerosol transport due to flow generated from coughing, talking, and breathing was obtained by applying the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. From the simulation results, it can be concluded that the aerosols released due to continuous talking travel a similar distance to that released due to sudden coughing. On the other hand, aerosols exhaled from breathing do not travel a long distance but float in air for a long time.","Hossain, M.; Faisal, N. H.",Aip Advances,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0042952,697

This research aims to evaluate the effect of moving to an online-only mode of studying and learning, and consequently gaining insight into the role of the physical campus in computing education. A mixed-method research approach was taken to reach these goals by combining interaction tracking data with weekly student reports and interviews. Results indicate that campus-based activities provide essential scaffolding for students' study behaviors, specifically time management and organization. Additionally, the physical study environment provided an informal space for social and academic interactions not found in the online sphere. Furthermore, when moving to the online study environment, students struggled with adapting their study behaviors, spending less time on organized activities and not changing their independent habits. Lastly, the online environment seemed to create considerable differences between those who mastered studying and those who did not, generating a larger ability gap than on campus.

Using the data, from its inception on March 6, 2020, to June 10, 2020. In our case, in Peru, It has been forecast that the disease will peak, on the contagion curve, at 160-day from the first case. The total duration of the disease is approximately 15 months (450 days), the number of deceases will be approximately 1% of the entire population, and the total number of infected will reach approximately 85% of the population. The evolution of the parameters β, γ and μ show that the disease always tends to disappear, since they are directly related to the population and the condition of the individuals (Susceptible, Infected or Recovered). These parameters control the model, however, it is not trivial to be able to establish adequate values over time, since it will largely depend on the culture of the population mainly, and the policies that the government proposes, and in which way the population will comply with these policies to control the evolution of the pandemic. For example, one way to control the parameter β is compulsory social isolation with a strict epidemiological stratified fence by cities, thereby reducing the value of the contagion rate to zero and allowing the pandemic to be effectively controlled. However, in Peru, this control has not been achieved, since the population is very varied in its culture and quite reluctant to comply with the government's recommendations. © 2020 IEEE.","Atencio, Y.

Level of agreement for using compensatory food access strategies was summed (score range: 7-42;higher scores reflecting increased use) and assessed for mean differences using ANOVA based on food insecurity classification. Rating scales were used to measure food access challenges and barriers to using nutrition assistance (4-5 item scales) during COVID-19. Spearman correlations examined associations between challenges/barriers and degree of food insecurity. Of participants (n = 358) who were food insecure, 74% were White and 77% were female. Food insecure individuals prior to and since COVID-19 were more likely than food secure participants to use compensatory strategies to ensure food affordability during COVID-19 (mean score = 30 vs 26, respectively;P = 0.002). Degree of food insecurity was associated with barriers to using nutrition assistance, including difficulty traveling to apply/recertify (r = 0.24;P &lt; 0.001) and frequency of experiencing food access challenges during COVID-19 (r = 0.16-0.33;P ≤ 0.002). Challenges with food access and barriers to utilizing nutrition assistance during COVID-19 are associated with food insecurity among SNAP-eligible individuals, potentially resulting in reliance upon more compensatory food affordability strategies. Efforts should be taken to minimize these barriers to ensure adequate food quantity and quality among food insecurity individuals. Utah State University Extension.

165685,From F2f to Ert: University Students' Perception of Remote Learning during the First Covid-19 Lockdown,2021,"This article empirically examines the effect of big data analytics (BDA) on healthcare supply chain (HSC) innovation, supply chain responsiveness, and supply chain resilience under the moderating effect of innovation leadership in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The scanning interpretation–action–performance model and organization information processing theory are used to explain BDA, HSC innovation, responsiveness, and resilience relationships. First, the hypotheses were tested using data collected from 190 experienced respondents working in the healthcare industry. Our structural equation modeling analysis using the partial least squares (PLS) method revealed that BDA capabilities play a pivotal role in building a responsive HSC and improving innovation, which has contributed to resilience during the current pandemic situation. High innovation leadership strengthens the effect of BDA capabilities on HSC innovation. High innovation leadership also increases the effect of BDA capabilities on responsiveness. Second, we validated and supplemented the empirical research findings using inputs collected in 30 semistructured qualitative questionnaires. Our article makes a unique contribution from the perspective of innovation leaderships. In particular, we argue that the role of innovative leadership in the COVID-19 pandemic situation is critical as it indirectly affects HSC resilience when BDA is in place.

165778,The Challenges of Online Teaching in Covid-19 Pandemic: a Case Study of Public Universities In,2021,"The overload of healthcare systems around the world and the danger of infection have limited the ability of researchers to obtain sufficient and reliable data on psychopathology in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The relationship between severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and specific mental disturbances remains poorly understood. Aim: to reveal the possibility of identifying the typology and frequency of psychiatric syndromes associated with acute COVID-19 using cluster analysis of discrete psychopathological phenomena. Materials and methods. Descriptive data on the mental state of 55 inpatients with COVID-19 were obtained by young-career physicians with psychiatric backgrounds. Classification of observed clinical phenomena was performed with k-means cluster analysis of variables codded from the main psychopathological symptoms. Dispersion analysis with p-level 0.05 was used to reveal the clusters differences in demography, parameters of inflammation and respiration function collected on the basis of the original medical records. Results. Three resulting clusters of patients were identified: persons with anxiety, disorders of fluency and tempo of thinking, mood, attention, motor-volitional sphere, reduced insight, and pessimistic plans for the future (n=11); persons without psychopathology (n=37); persons with disorientation, disorders of memory, attention, fluency, and tempo of thinking, reduced insight (n=7). The development of a certain type of impaired mental state was specifically associated with: age, lung lesions according to computed tomography, saturation, respiratory rate, C-reactive protein level, platelet count. Conclusion. The prevalence and typology of psychiatric disorders in patients with acute COVID-19 were described using the computational psychiatry approach.","Sorokin, M. Y.; Palchikova, E.

165820,How Black Teen Girls Navigate Social Media to Form Romantic Relationships,2021,"Repurposing approved drugs may rapidly establish effective interventions during a public health crisis. This has yielded immunomodulatory treatments for severe COVID-19, but repurposed antivirals have not been successful to date because of redundancy of the target in vivo or suboptimal exposures at studied doses. Nitazoxanide is an FDA approved antiparasitic medicine, that physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling has indicated may provide antiviral concentrations across the dosing interval, when repurposed at higher than approved doses. Within the AGILE trial platform (NCT04746183) an open label, adaptive, phase 1 trial in healthy adult participants was undertaken with high dose nitazoxanide. Participants received 1500mg nitazoxanide orally twice-daily with food for 7 days. Primary outcomes were safety, tolerability, optimum dose and schedule. Intensive pharmacokinetic sampling was undertaken day 1 and 5 with Cmin sampling on day 3 and 7. Fourteen healthy participants were enrolled between 18th February and 11th May 2021. All 14 doses were completed by 10/14 participants. Nitazoxanide was safe and well tolerated with no significant adverse events. Moderate gastrointestinal disturbance (loose stools) occurred in 8 participants (57.1%), with urine and sclera discolouration in 12 (85.7%) and 9 (64.3%) participants, respectively, without clinically significant bilirubin elevation. This was self-limiting and resolved upon drug discontinuation. PBPK predictions were confirmed on day 1 but with underprediction at day 5. Median Cmin was above the in vitro target concentration on first dose and maintained throughout. Nitazoxanide administered at 1500mg BID with food was safe and well tolerated and a phase 1b/2a study is now being initiated in COVID-19 patients.","Walker, L.

165854,"The transition to online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic at a regional, rural university: The experience of learning assistants",2020,"Human and social vulnerability in the face of the pandemic once again raises the question of knowledge and of the two key dimensions of the individual (rationality and responsibility) framed in the various relationships they establish (with nature, with other individuals, with state institutions etc.). These become relationships of knowledge and awareness concerning the facts and laws of social-state organization. Being aware that the pandemic crisis left its mark on all areas of life, changing the nature of human relations, affecting the benchmarks of values, and requiring a review of the foundations of social organization, we believe it necessary to assess the current situation through a systemic approach aimed at identifying the benchmarks of the balance between individuality and sociality. Thanks to the assessment of the interdependencies between the individual and the social, the following objectives were addressed: to define the changes caused by the pandemic and analyze the social processes;to validate the decisions taken by the authorities from a logical, praxeological and axiological point of view;to emphasize the importance of norms and principles in the social organization;to determine the role of social actors in overcoming the crisis, and to assess how social relations have evolved under pandemic conditions. Therefore, the present article, applying an interdisciplinary methodology to the pandemic crisis, aims to evaluate, understand and raise awareness of the situation and its impact on the social and human situation, where solidarity, rationality, and human responsibility are being reassessed.","Ciobanu, Rodica",Journal of Community Positive Practices,https://doi.org/10.35782/jcpp.2021.2.01,697

166112,Relative Stock Market Performance during the Coronavirus Pandemic: Virus vs. Policy Effects in 80 Countries,2021,"PurposeThis study aims to estimate the time–frequency connectedness among global financial markets. It draws a comparison between the full sample and the sample during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachThe study uses the connectedness framework of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and Barunik and Krehlik (2018), both of which consider time and frequency connectedness and show that spillover is specific to not only the time domain but also the frequency (short- and long-run) domain. The analysis also includes pairwise connectedness by making use of network analysis. Daily data on the MSCI World Index, Barclays Bloomberg Global Treasury Index, Oil future, Gold future, Dow Jones World Islamic Index and Bitcoin have been used over the period from May 01, 2013 to July 31, 2020.FindingsThis study finds that cryptocurrency, bond and gold are hedges against both conventional stocks and Islamic stocks on average;however, these are not “safe havens” during an economic crisis, i.e. COVID-19. External shocks, such as COVID-19, strengthen the return connectedness among all six financial markets.Research limitations/implicationsFor investors, the study provides important insights that during external shocks such as COVID-19, there is a spillover effect, and investors are unable to hedge risk between conventional stocks and Islamic stocks. These so-called safe haven investment alternatives suffer from the similar negative impact of systemic financial risk. However, during an external shock such as COVID-19, cryptocurrencies, bonds and gold can be used to hedge risk against conventional stocks, Islamic stocks and oil. Moreover, the findings imply that by engaging in momentum trading, active investors can gain short-run benefits before the market processes any new information.Originality/valueThe study contributes to the emergent literature investigating the connectedness among financial markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides evidence that the return connectedness among six global financial markets, namely, conventional stocks, Islamic stocks, bond, oil, gold and cryptocurrency, is extremely strong. From a methodological standpoint, this study finds that COVID-19 pandemic shock has a significant short-run impact on the connectedness among financial markets.","Muhammad Abubakr, Naeem Saba Sehrish Costa Mabel D.",Pacific Accounting Review,https://doi.org/10.1108/par-08-2020-0114,697

Since commercial unmanned aerial vehicles have fundamental limitations on payloads and battery capacities, hybrid ground vehicle and unmanned aerial vehicle models have been actively investigated as practical solutions. However, these studies have focused on linehaul (delivery) demands, excluding a large number of backhaul (pickup) demands. If we consider both demands at the same time, an empty unmanned aerial vehicle that finished linehaul service can be immediately used to serve a backhaul customer. In this study, we investigate the differences that arise by considering backhauls as an additional element of the routing problem. A mixed integer linear programming model is developed, and a heuristic is constructed to solve large-scale problems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we compare it to existing models using a real-world example.

Evidence from the NARDL Approach,2021,"Objective To compare the efficacy of COVID 19 vaccines between those with immunocompromised medical conditions and those who are immunocompetent Design Systematic review and meta-analysis Data sources PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CORD-19 and WHO COVID-19 research databases were searched for eligible comparative studies published between 1st December 2020 and 3rd September 2021. ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched in August 2021 to identify registered yet unpublished or ongoing studies. Study selection Prospective observational studies which compared the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination between those with immunocompromising medical conditions and those who were immunocompetent were included. Two reviewers independently screened for potentially eligible studies. Data extraction The primary outcomes of interest were cumulative incidence of seroconversion after first and second doses of COVID vaccination. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 antibody titre level after first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccination. After duplicate data abstraction, a frequentist random effects meta-analysis was conducted. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Results After screening 3283 studies, 42 studies that met our inclusion criteria were identified. 18 immunocompromised cohorts from 17 studies reported seroconversion in immunocompromised patients compared to healthy controls after the first dose and 30 immunocompromised cohorts in 28 studies reporting data after the second dose. Among immunocompromised groups, in incremental order, transplant recipients had the lowest pooled risk ratio of 0.06 (95%CI: 0.04 to 0.09, I^2=0%, p=0.81) (GRADE=Moderate) followed by haematological cancer patients at 0.36 (95%CI: 0.21 to 0.62, I^2 = 89%, p<0.01) (GRADE=Moderate), solid cancer patients at 0.40 (95%CI: 0.31 to 0.52, I^2 = 63%, p=0.03) (GRADE=Moderate) and IMID patients at 0.66 (95%CI: 0.48 to 0.91, I^2=81%, p<0.01) (GRADE=Moderate). After the second dose, the lowest pooled risk ratio was again seen in transplant recipients at 0.29 (95%CI: 0.21 to 0.40, I^2=91%, p<0.01) (GRADE=Moderate), haematological cancer patients at 0.68 (95%CI: 0.57 to 0.80, I^2=68%, p=0.02) (GRADE=Low), IMID patients at 0.79 (95%CI: 0.72 to 0.786, I^2=87%, p<0.01) (GRADE=Low) and solid cancer at 0.92 (95%CI: 0.89 to 0.95, I^2=26%, p=0.25) (GRADE=Low). Conclusion Seroconversion rates and serological titres are significantly lower in immunocompromised patients with transplant recipients having the poorest outcomes.

An event study analysis,2021,"Literature has been an imitator of life for generations on this earth, this literature has voiced the voiceless. Recent contemporary and postmodern literary theories have catered to burgeoning notions of logic that go beyond human survival on the planet. Science fiction is a genre of fiction that encompasses imaginative concepts like futuristic scientific-technological settings, faster than light, past and future spatial time travel, the existence of parallel universes and extraterrestrial life etc. An outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The outbreak was declared as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on 30 January 2020. During this crisis, literature also plays an important role and apocalyptic literature has shown the disastrous consequences if humans didn't stop their behaviour and attitude towards the world. This research project aims to take literature out of the realm of imagination and present the harsh realities of culture. This study revealed how literature represents the truth of the world that science is learning every day, and how certain inventions can have harmful effects if they are not halted in time.

166585,Social Media Escapism: Exploratory Study of the use of Digital Media by Tirana University Students of English Language,2021,"BackgroundFamily planning health centers (FPHCs) provide low-income individuals in rural areas with essential primary care services, including STD prevention, testing, and treatment. Fifteen states have defunded FPHCs, causing thousands to be left without such services. This has accelerated in the COVID-19 era. We used a longitudinal analysis to examine the impact of FPHC closures in Iowa on gonorrhea and chlamydia incidence at the county level.MethodsIn 2017, Iowa defunded FPHCs, resulting in four clinic closures. This analysis uses Poisson regression for rates on gonorrhea and chlamydia incidence data from 2000–2018 to investigate if clinic closures were associated with reported gonorrhea and chlamydia cases. Newey-West standard errors are used to adjust for any time-related trends in STI incidence. Given the mid-year policy change, all data from 2017 was removed before running the Poisson regression model.ResultsWe examined 34,479 gonorrhea and 169,660 chlamydia cases. Iowans had 1.99 (95% CI: 1.67, 2.37) times the rate of gonorrhea after clinic closures compared to before closures. In 2018, people in counties with clinic closures were 1.71 (95% CI: 1.01,2.90) times more likely to be diagnosed with gonorrhea than residents in the counties without closures. Iowans had 1.05 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.07) times the rate of chlamydia after clinic closures compared to before closures. People in counties with closures were 1.37 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.69) times more likely to have chlamydia in 2018 as compared to those in counties without closures.ConclusionsDespite the fact that many STI diagnoses are made and reported by FPHCs, our data shows that reported gonorrhea and chlamydia cases increased in the year following clinic closures. This is consistent with delayed diagnoses and missed opportunities for providing essential STI services to vulnerable and under-served rural residents. Legislative action is urgently needed to ensure essential STI services for all.","Srinivas, M.; Yang, E.; Lin, F.; Tang, W.; Tucker, J.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-sti.143,697

This study aimed to investigate the factors that affected the decision to download the app among individuals in the Isle of Wight. Methods Online questionnaires were distributed over social media to the sample population. Quantitative data were analysed, both descriptively and using a Chi-square or Fisher's test. Qualitative data were analysed through content analysis. Results Overall, 74.2% of participants downloaded the COVID-19 app, citing compliance, protection and fighting the pandemic or returning to normal as their main reasons. There was a significant negative correlation between having concerns about the app and downloading the app (P=&lt;0.01). Concerns were split into the three themes of privacy or data security concerns, technology issues and increased complacency. There was a significant negative correlation between being in a COVID-19 high-risk group and downloading the app (P=0.042). Conclusions Concerns about the COVID-19 app, particularly in terms of its security, significantly affected whether participants were likely to download it. The results provide insight into factors influencing mass public health behaviours and can form the basis for future research into app-based interventions.","Phillips, Peter Darby Iain Phillips Louise Wicks Ashley",British Journal of Healthcare Management,https://doi.org/10.12968/bjhc.2021.0013,697

It is widely known that keystroke or typing dynamics for short, fixed texts (e.g., passwords) could serve as a behavioral biometric. In this study, we investigate whether keystroke data from essay responses can lead to a reliable biometric measure, with implications for test security and the monitoring of writing fluency and style changes. Based on keystroke data collected from a high-stakes writing testing setting, we established a preliminary biometric benchmark for detecting test-taker identity by using features extracted from their writing process logs. We report a benchmark keystroke biometric accuracy of equal error rate of 4.7% for identifying same versus different individuals on an essay task. In particular, we show that the inclusion of writing process features (e.g., features designed to describe the writing process) in addition to the widely used typing-timing features (e.g., features based on the time intervals between two-letter key sequences) improves the accuracy of the keystroke biometrics. The proposed keystroke biometrics can have important implications for the writing assessments administered through the remotely proctored tests that have been widely adopted during the COVID pandemic. © 2021 Educational Testing Service","Choi, I.; Hao, J.; Deane, P.; Zhang, M.",ETS Research Report Series,https://doi.org/10.1002/ets2.12326,697
167012,Students’ Attitude and Impact of Online Learning;Role of Teachers and Classmate Support During the Covid-19 Crisis,2021,"Whenever students use any drilling system the question arises how much of their learning is meaningful learning vs memorisation through repetition or rote learning. Although both types of learning have their place in an educational system it is important to be able to distinguish between these two approaches to learning and identify options which can dislodge students from rote learning and motivate them towards meaningful learning. The tutor-web is an online drilling system. The design aim of the system is learning rather than evaluation. This is done by presenting students with multiple-choice questions which are selected randomly but linked to the students' performance. The questions themselves can be generated for a specific topic by drawing correct and incorrect answers from a collection associated with a general problem statement or heading. With this generating process students may see the same question heading twice but be presented with all new answer options or a mixture of new and old answer options. Data from a course on probability theory and statistics, taught during COVID-19, are analysed to separate rote learning from meaningful learning. The analyses show non-rote learning, but even with large question databases, students' performance is better when they are presented with an answer option they have seen before. An element of rote learning is thus exhibited but a deeper learning is also demonstrated. The item database has been seeded with hints such that some questions contain clues to cue the students towards the correct answer. This ties in with the issue of meaningful learning versus rote learning since the hope is that a new hint will work as a cue to coax the student to think harder about the question rather than continue to employ rote learning. Preliminary results indicate that hints are particularly useful for students with poor performance metrics.","Stefansson, Gunnar; Jonsdottir, Anna Helga; Jonmundsson, Thorarinn; Sigurdsson, Gylfi Snaer; Bergsdottir, Ingunn Lilja",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12288v1.pdf,697

To explore the impact of RAS inhibitor use on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, from all published studies. Methods and FindingsA systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of RAS inhibitors in relation to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and/or the severity and mortality associated with COVID-19 was conducted. English language bibliographic databases PubMed, Web of Science, OVID Embase, Scopus, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, searched from Jan 1st, 2020 to July 20th, 2020. 58 observational studies (69,200 COVID-19 patients and 3,103,335 controls) were included. There was no difference in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21), (adjusted OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.02), (adjusted HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.31). There was no significant difference in the severe Covid-19 case rate between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.36), (adjusted OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.12), or in mortality due to COVID-19 between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.44), (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23), (adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.14). ConclusionsIn the most comprehensive analysis of all available data to date, treatment with RAS inhibitors was not associated with increased risk of infection, severity of disease, or mortality due to COVID-19. The best available evidence suggests that these treatments should not be discontinued on the basis of concern about risk associated with COVID-19.","Zhang, Yi; Yu, Shikai; Xu, Yawei; Williams, Bryan",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.03.20206375,697
167306,Augmented Reality in Virtual Classroom for Higher Education During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Abstract Introduction: Vitamin D supplements are recommended for elderly care home residents with little sunlight exposure. However, their use in care homes is limited and vitamin D deficiency in residents is widespread. This study aimed to understand perceived responsibility for the vitamin D status of residents and the determinants of current practice around supplementation. Methods: Thirteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants in two areas of Southern England including care home managers, general practitioners (GPs) and public health professionals. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Results: Inductive thematic analysis identified four themes: medical framing; professional and sector boundaries; awareness of national guidance; and ethical and practical issues. Vitamin D supplements were not routinely given to residents, and most participants, including the GPs, believed the vitamin D status of residents was the responsibility of the GP. Care home managers felt unable to make decisions about vitamin D and vulnerable to suggestions of wrongdoing in administering over-the-counter vitamin tablets. This results in vitamin D requiring prescription by medical professionals and few care home residents receiving vitamin D supplements. Conclusion: The medical framing of vitamin D supplements in care homes is a practical barrier to residents receiving them and is out of step with public health recommendations. Vitamin D levels in care home residents could be improved through universal supplementation. This requires a paradigm shift so that vitamin D is understood as a protective nutrient as well as a medicine, and a public health as well as a medical responsibility. The failure to ensure vitamin D adequacy of residents may emerge as a factor in the spread and severity of COVID-19 in care homes and gives increased urgency to addressing this issue.","Williams, J.; Williams, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.21.20136697v1?rss=1,697
167380,Reflections on Blended Learning in Management Education: A Qualitative Study with a Push-pull Migration Perspective,2021,"Background: Several community-based studies have assessed the ability of different symptoms to identify COVID-19 infections, but few have compared symptoms over time (reflecting SARS-CoV-2 variants) and by vaccination status. Methods: Using data and samples collected by the COVID-19 Infection Survey at regular visits to representative households across the UK, we compared symptoms in new PCR-positives and comparator test-negative controls. Results: From 26/4/2020-7/8/2021, 27,869 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive episodes occurred in 27,692 participants (median 42 years (IQR 22-58)); 13,427 (48%) self-reported symptoms (""symptomatic positive episodes""). The comparator group comprised 3,806,692 test-negative visits (457,215 participants); 130,612 (3%) self-reported symptoms (""symptomatic negative visits""). Reporting of any symptoms in positive episodes varied over calendar time, reflecting changes in prevalence of variants, incidental changes (e.g. seasonal pathogens, schools re-opening) and vaccination roll-out. There was a small increase in sore throat reporting in symptomatic positive episodes and negative visits from April-2021. After May-2021 when Delta emerged there were substantial increases in headache and fever in positives, but not in negatives. Although specific symptom reporting in symptomatic positive episodes vs. negative visits varied by age, sex, and ethnicity, only small improvements in symptom-based infection detection were obtained; e.g. adding fatigue/weakness or all eight symptoms to the classic four symptoms (cough, fever, loss of taste/smell) increased sensitivity from 74% to 81% to 90% but tests per positive from 4.6 to 5.3 to 8.7. Conclusions: Whilst SARS-CoV-2-associated symptoms vary by variant, vaccination status and demographics, differences are modest and do not warrant large-scale changes to targeted testing approaches given resource implications.","Vihta, K.-D.; Pouwels, K.

167455,Accounting for biosecurity in Italy under COVID-19 lockdown,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major effect on both older people with dementia and families caring for them. This paper presents the results of an online survey carried out among Italian and Hungarian family carers of people with dementia during the first pandemic wave (May–July 2020, n = 370). The research questions were the following: (1) How has the pandemic changed the lives of family carers? (2) How did government restriction measures change the availability of care-related help? (3) What other changes did families experience? Results show that about one-quarter of both subsamples experienced a deterioration in their financial status. A decline in both general and mental health was also reported. Due to “lockdown”, family carers’ burden increased substantially. Utilization of care-related help decreased, and the share of those left with no help increased in both countries. Cross-country differences emerged in terms of dementia care system, severity of the first pandemic wave, and measures put in place by governments. Findings outline the weaknesses of support structures and their country-specific vulnerabilities to a worldwide pandemic. To better protect people with dementia in the future, it is essential to strengthen their family carers, and support structures need to be re-evaluated and re-designed.","Kostyál, László Árpád Széman Zsuzsa Almási Virág Erzsébet Fabbietti Paolo Quattrini Sabrina Socci Marco Lamura Giovanni Gagliardi Cristina",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137107,697

To this day, effective therapy to cure this virus is yet to be found. A number of treatments were tested;however, the result is not satisfactory. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is one of the supportive therapies applied to treat COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe symptoms. We reported 41 years old male patient diagnosed with severe COVID-19 infection, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and thrombophilia. The patient received a therapy following the Ministry of Health’s guideline for COVID-19 handling. On the third day, respiratory failure occurred with a P/F ratio of 255 and the chest X-ray result showed vascular streak and ground-glass opacity;thus, the hospital decided to perform TPE. The TPE was performed twice in 5 days interval. After TPE was administered, clinical development is observed both subjectively in the form of reduced symptoms, normal respiration rate, and objectively, the improvement in blood gas analysis, increased O2 saturation, and a decrease in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) level significant clinical laboratory and radiological improvement possibly due to cytokine storm which is remedied by TPE action.","Reviono, Reviono; Arifin, Arifin; en,",Jurnal Kedokteran Dan Kesehatan Indonesia,https://doi.org/10.20885/jkki.vol12.iss1.art13,697

We performed genomic analyses of 1246 systematically collected shigellae from seven LMIC to inform control and identify factors that could limit the effectiveness of current approaches. We found that S. sonnei contributes ≥20-fold more disease than other Shigella species relative to its genomic diversity and highlight existing diversity and adaptative capacity among S. flexneri that may generate vaccine escape variants in <6 months. Furthermore, we show convergent evolution of resistance against the current recommended antimicrobial among shigellae. This demonstrates the urgent need to integrate existing genomic diversity into vaccine and treatment plans for Shigella, and other pathogens.","Bengtsson, Rebecca J.; Simpkin, Adam J.; Pulford, Caisey V.; Low, Ross; Rasko, David A.; Rigden, Daniel J.; Hall, Neil; Barry, Eileen M.; Tennant, Sharon M.; Baker, Kate S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.09.447709,697

This situation can create deadlocks in places where there is a discrepancy among municipal, state and federal policies. The exponential increase of the number of infectious people and deaths in the last days shows that the COVID-19 epidemics is still at its early stage in Brazil and such political disarray can lead to very serious results. In this work, we study the COVID-19 epidemics in Brazilian cities using early-time approximations of the SIR model in networks. Different from other works, the underlying network is constructed by feeding real-world data on local COVID-19 cases reported by Brazilian cities to a regularized vector autoregressive model, which estimates directional COVID-19 transmission channels (links) of every pair of cities (vertices) using spectral network analysis. Our results reveal that social isolation and, especially, the use of masks can effectively reduce the transmission rate of COVID-19 in Brazil. We also build counterfactual scenarios to measure the human impact of these public health measures in terms of reducing the number of COVID-19 cases at the epidemics peak. We find that the efficiency of social isolation and of using of masks differs significantly across cities. For instance, we find that they would potentially decrease the COVID-19 epidemics peak in Sao Paulo (SP) and Brasilia (DF) by 15% and 25%, respectively. We hope our study can support the design of further public health measures.","Silva, Thiago Christiano; Anghinoni, Leandro; Zhao, Liang",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.15.20102988,697

Results We here present our new program ClaMSA that classifies multiple sequence alignments using a phylogenetic model. It uses a novel continuous-time Markov chain machine learning layer, named CTMC, that is learned end-to-end together with (recurrent) neural networks for a learning task. We trained ClaMSA discriminately to classify aligned codon sequences that are candidates of coding regions into coding or non-coding and obtained six times fewer false positives for this task on vertebrate and fly alignments than existing methods at the same true positive rate. ClaMSA and the CTMC layer are general tools that could be used for other machine learning tasks on tree-related sequence data.

NPS gather both extracellular material and human respiratory epithelial cells and, when used with RT-PCR, have reliable sensitivity for detection of viral infection. However, at our institution, we identified a 1.7% re-order rate within 7-days for NPS for respiratory pathogen RT-PCR, which we hypothesize may be due to low confidence in adequate sample collection. We sought to identify an inexpensive and accessible strategy for benchside quality assurance of NPS adequacy by observing microscopic content of viral transport media. For 801 NPS samples collected in November 2019, we air-dried and safranin-stained aliquots of viral transport media on glass slides. We then counted morphologically distinct ciliated columnar epithelial cells (CCEs). 19% of samples negative by RT-PCR for respiratory pathogens had no CCEs, while just 6% of positive samples exhibited the same. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to compare presence of CCEs between samples that were positive and negative for respiratory pathogens by RT-PCR (p=3.3x10-38). The negative predictive value (NPV) of finding no identifiable CCEs on microscopy was 85%. We posit that samples without identifiable CCEs may have been inadequately collected. The basic, benchside protocol using inexpensive laboratory reagents that we describe here could help improve accuracy and accessibility of NPS and RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV2 and other respiratory pathogens while conserving limited resources in the face of a pandemic.","Matelski, Alexander T; Siddique, Nikhut I; Mead, Philip; Raimondi, Tommaso; Jorgenson, Laura C; Calderon, Omar; Harman, Kory; Farrell, John J",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.20050088,697

Although KLRD1 has been identified as a potential biomarker for influenza susceptibility, it remains unclear whether forecasting symptomatic flu infection based on pre-exposure host gene expression might be possible. Method To examine this hypothesis, we developed DeepFlu using the state-of-the-art deep learning approach on the human gene expression data infected with IAV subtype H1N1 or H3N2 viruses to forecast who would catch the flu prior to an exposure to IAV. Results The results indicated that such forecast is possible and, in other words, gene expression could reflect the strength of host immunity. In the leave-one-person-out cross-validation, DeepFlu based on deep neural network outperformed the models using convolutional neural network, random forest, or support vector machine, achieving 70.0% accuracy, 0.787 AUROC, and 0.758 AUPR for H1N1 and 73.8% accuracy, 0.847 AUROC, and 0.901 AUPR for H3N2. In the external validation, DeepFlu also reached 71.4% accuracy, 0.700 AUROC, and 0.723 AUPR for H1N1 and 73.5% accuracy, 0.732 AUROC, and 0.749 AUPR for H3N2, surpassing the KLRD1 biomarker. In addition, DeepFlu which was trained only by pre-exposure data worked the best than by other time spans and mixed training data of H1N1 and H3N2 did not necessarily enhance prediction. DeepFlu is available at https://github.com/ntou-compbio/DeepFlu. Conclusions DeepFlu is a prognostic tool that can moderately recognize individuals susceptible to the flu and may help prevent the spread of IAV.","Zan, Anna; Xie, Zhong-Ru; Hsu, Yi-Chen; Chen, Yu-Hao; Lin, Tsung-Hsien; Chang, Yong-Shan; Chang, Kuan Y.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.02.407940,697

170341,Pandemic effects on social media marketing behaviors in India,2021,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a simple deterministic model that quantifies previously adopted preventive measures driven by the trend of the reported number of deaths in both Italy and India. In addition, the authors forecast the spread based on some selected quantified preventive measures. The optimal exiting policy is derived using the inverse dynamics of the model. Furthermore, the model developed by the authors is dependent on the daily number of deaths;as such, it is sensitive to the death rate but remains insensitive to trends in deaths. Design/methodology/approach In the wake of COVID-19, policymakers and health professionals realized the limitations and shortcomings of current healthcare systems and pandemic response policies. The need to revise global and national pandemic response mechanisms has been thrust into the public spotlight. To this end, the authors devise an approach to identify the most suitable governmental non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) policies, previously adopted in a community, country or region that serve as the foundation for most pandemic strategies. Findings Leveraging Italy, the authors compare the aftermath by considering three scenarios: (a) recently adopted preventive measures, (b) strictest preventive measures previously adopted, and (c) the optimal exiting policy. In comparison to the second scenario, the authors estimate about twice the number of recoveries and deaths within five months under the first scenario and about 80 times more under the optimal scenario. Whereas in India, the authors applied one scenario of recently adopted preventative measures to showcase the rapid turnaround of their model. According to the new timeline, almost 90% of all deaths in India could have been prevented if the policies implemented in April 2021 were put in place three months prior, i.e. in January 2021. Originality/value The novelty of the proposed approach is in the use of inverse dynamics of a simple deterministic model that allows capturing the trend of contact rate as a function of adopted NPIs, regardless of pandemic type.","Saab, S.; Al Abbas, M.; Samaha, R.

We found that spleen size in healthy NM-Rs varies considerably. We therefore classified NM-Rs according to spleen size as NM-Rs with small spleens or enlarged spleens. Animals with enlarged spleens showed potentially better anti-microbial profiles and were much more likely to have a high rank within the colony. Splenomegaly was associated with infection in sick NM-Rs, but not in NM-Rs with enlarged spleens. In all healthy NM-Rs splenic erythropoiesis, megakaryopoiesis and myelopoiesis were increased, but B lymphopoiesis was reduced and splenic marginal zone showed markedly altered morphology when compared to other rodents. However, in NM-Rs lymphocytes were found in secondary sites such as lymph nodes, gut lymphoid nodules and thymus. Thus, the NM-R spleen is a major site of adult hematopoiesis under normal physiological conditions. Overall, the NM-R immune system seems to rely mainly on innate immune responses with a more restricted adaptive immune response. We propose that the anatomical plasticity of the spleen might be regulated by social interaction and gives immunological advantage to increase the life-span of higher ranked animals.","Bégay, Valérie; Cirovic, Branko; Barker, Alison J.; Klopfleisch, Robert; Hart, Daniel W.; Bennett, Nigel C.; Lewin, Gary R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.15.456351,697
171044,"Shared pretenses for collective inaction: the economic growth imperative, COVID-19, and climate change",2021,"Sepsis is a severe life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. So far, there are no pharmacotherapies to stop sepsis. Salbutamol, a commonly used β2-adrenoreceptor agonist, has found to be potential in regulating immune response dysfunction and exert anti-inflammatory effect. However, salbutamol exists two isomers. R-isomer exhibits the therapeutic effect and clinical benefit, while S-isomer proves to be detrimental rather than benign. So, in this study, we investigated the preventive and therapeutic effect of R-salbutamol (R-sal), S-salbutamol (S-sal) or racemic mixture in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. Dexamethasone (Dex) was set as comparison. The results showed that R-sal markedly improved seven-day survival rate of septic mice both administered before or after LPS. Whereas Dex showed toxic and accelerated the death of septic mice when given before LPS injection. Lung histological examination and lung function assay revealed that LPS challenge resulted in acute lung damage, including inflammatory cell infiltration, thickened alveolar septa and congestion, and decreased minute volume in septic mice. R-sal pretreatment efficiently inhibited these changes, accompanying by markedly reduced lung MPO level, serum cytokines levels and lactate release and significantly restored the lymphocytes and suppressed the percentage of monocytes. Racemic mixture exhibited diminished effects while S-sal showed enhanced cytokines release. In addition, R-sal pretreatment showed a better improvement in prognostic pulmonary function at day4 in survived mice than that of Rac-sal. Collectively, our results indicate the potential benefit of R-sal for sepsis and sepsis-induced lung injury.","Beng, Huimin; Wang, Shanping; Hu, Junhua; Liang, Xinglong; Qin, Haolong; Tan, Wen",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.17.444573,697

The coronavirus 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) is a commonly investigated target in COVID-19, however less work has been directed toward the equally important papain-like protease (PLpro). PLpro is less characterized due to its fewer and more diverse cleavages in coronavirus proteomes and the assumption that it mainly modulates host pathways with its deubiquitinating activity. Here, I extend my previous work on 3CLpro human cleavage prediction and enrichment/depletion analysis to PLpro.[1] Using three sets of neural networks trained on different taxonomic ranks of dataset with a maximum of 463 different putative PLpro cleavages, Matthews correlation coefficients of 0.900, 0.948, and 0.966 were achieved for Coronaviridae, Betacoronavirus, and Sarbecovirus, respectively. I predict that more than 1,000 human proteins may be cleaved by PLpro depending on diversity of the training dataset and that many of these proteins are distinct from those previously predicted to be cleaved by 3CLpro. PLpro cleavages are similarly nonrandomly distributed and result in many annotations shared with 3CLpro cleavages including ubiquitination, poly(A) tail and 5’ cap RNA binding proteins, helicases, and endogenous viral proteins. Combining PLpro with 3CLpro cleavage predictions, additional novel enrichment analysis was performed on known substrates of cleaved E3 ubiquitin ligases with results indicating that many pathways including viral RNA sensing are affected indirectly by E3 ligase cleavage independent of traditional PLpro deubiquitinating activity. As with 3CLpro, PLpro whole proteome cleavage prediction revealed many novel potential therapeutic targets against coronaviruses, although experimental verification is similarly required.","Prescott, Lucas",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.04.462902,697
171085,Jumping into the virtual environment implications and possibilities for arts education,2021,"Type III CRISPR systems detect invading RNA, resulting in the activation of the enzymatic Cas10 subunit. The Cas10 cyclase domain generates cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) second messenger molecules, activating a variety of effector nucleases that degrade nucleic acids to provide immunity. The prophage-encoded Vibrio metoecus type III-B (VmeCmr) locus is uncharacterised, lacks the HD nuclease domain in Cas10 and encodes a NucC DNA nuclease effector that is also found associated with Cyclic-oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signalling systems (CBASS). Here we demonstrate that VmeCmr is activated by target RNA binding, generating cyclic-triadenylate (cA3) to stimulate a robust NucC-mediated DNase activity. The specificity of VmeCmr is probed, revealing the importance of specific nucleotide positions in segment 1 of the RNA duplex and the protospacer flanking sequence (PFS). We harness this programmable system to demonstrate the potential for a highly specific and sensitive assay for detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA with a limit of detection (LoD) of 2 fM using a commercial plate reader without any extrinsic amplification step. The sensitivity is highly dependent on the guide RNA used, suggesting that target RNA secondary structure plays an important role that may also be relevant in vivo.","Grüschow, Sabine; Adamson, Catherine S.; White, Malcolm F.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.13.460032,697

However, evidence of willingness to volunteer is scarce, particularly in Asian countries. Objective: To study Bruneian university nursing students' willingness to volunteer during a pandemic in Brunei. Methods: An online cross-sectional study was conducted at Universiti Brunei Darussalam from January to February 2021. A self-administered questionnaire was used to measure willingness factors, including motivational factors, barriers, enablers, and level of agreement to volunteer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sub-group inferential analysis was applied. Results: 72 participants were included in this study. 75.0% of whom were willing to volunteer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors that influenced the willingness of nursing students to volunteer were marital status (p<0.001), year of study (p<0.001), altruism (p<0.001), personal safety (p<0.001), and knowledge level (p<0.001). Conclusion: Nursing students are an invaluable resource, and they are highly willing to be part of disaster management. Training and planning should prepare the nursing students for disaster or pandemic readiness and integrated them into the undergraduate nursing curriculum. Align with this, safety aspects of nursing students during volunteering should also be considered, including the provision of childcare assistance, sufficient personal protective equipment, vaccination, and prophylaxis to the volunteers.","Aziz, Aahha Abdul-Mumin K.

Methods Parents of healthy children younger than 12-year-old of both gender were asked to fulfill a questionnaire describing their perspective of Silver Diamine Fluoride SDF treatment and different factors that could modify their opinion as sociodemographic characteristics, tooth location, type of dentition, advanced management techniques as well as dental caries management during- and post-COVID pandemic. Participants’ responses were categorized according to the three-Point Likert scale as acceptable, neutral, and not acceptable. Fisher test was used to test for significant factors affecting parental acceptance of SDF treatment. The level of significance was tested at 0.05 using SPSS program. Results A total of 158 parents participated in this study. The parental acceptance of SDF treatment was found to be limited to 31.6%. The SDF acceptance rate increased significantly if SDF was used on posterior teeth, on deciduous dentition, prior to shifting to conventional restoration under general anesthesia, and to minimize chances for cross-infection particularly during- and after the recovery from the COVID pandemic. Conclusions SDF treatment on posterior teeth and deciduous dentition was found to be more accepted by the parents than anterior and permanent teeth. Although a majority of parents reported restricted SDF treatment acceptance, most parents were willing to compromise the esthetic dilemma as they understand the risks of alternative interventions. Clinical significance Dentists are encouraged to adopt SDF treatment and offer it for their patients and caregivers prior to shifting to advanced dental management techniques particularly during and following the COVID era. The dentist must provide an informed consent form, which includes clear photographs showing expected staining, especially when treating anterior teeth.","Bahathiq, Amal Arafa Abla",Pediatric Dental Journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pdj.2021.07.002,697

We use a novel digital mobility dataset, that traces the undertaken trips on Easter Sunday 2020 and instrument them with regional accessibility as measured by the regional road infrastructure of Germany's 401 NUTS III regions. We identify a robust negative association between the number of infected cases per capita and average travel time on roads to the next major urban center. What has been a hinderance for economic performance in good economic times, appears to be a benevolent factor in the COVID-19 pandemic: bad road infrastructure. Using road infrastructure as an instrument for mobility reductions we assess the causal effect of mobility reductions on infections. The study shows that keeping mobility of people low is a main factor to reduce infections. Aggregating over all regions, our results suggest that there would have been about 55,600 infections less on May 5th, 2020, if mobility at the onset of the disease were 10 percent lower.","Krenz, A.; Strulik, H.",German Economic Review,https://doi.org/10.1515/ger-2020-0068,697

We conducted a survey with 758 couples focusing on homeschooling, work–family conflict, and alcohol use (April 2020). The 211 homeschooling couples reported more work–family conflict than the 547 non-homeschooling couples;there also were stronger effects on family interference with work in women. Among the homeschooling couples, homeschooling hours were associated with greater partner drinking. In distinguishable dyad analyses by gender, women’s hours homeschooling were associated with greater drinking frequency by both parents. Men’s hours homeschooling were associated with lower drinking frequency in their partners. Increased work–family conflict in homeschooling couples is particularly worrisome given its link to increased stress and poor mental health. Moreover, women’s increased drinking may impede their ability to support their families during the pandemic. Men’s increased drinking could put homeschooling mothers at risk for escalating conflict/domestic violence, given links of male drinking to intimate partner violence. Finally, the protective-partner effects of men’s homeschooling hours on women’s drinking frequency suggests that more egalitarian division of homeschooling labor may have protective cross-over effects.","DesRoches, Danika I.; Deacon, S.

In our study, we aimed to investigate the threshold value of the chest X-ray (CXR) score, which would require the patient to be transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) through scoring the CXR of COVID-19 patients receiving in-patient treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patients that tested positive for COVID-19 on the basis of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, who was hospitalized in our hospital between the dates of March 15 and May 30, 2020, were included in the study. The CXRs of these patients taken during hospitalization were scored. The threshold value of the CXR score of the patients transferred to the ICU was calculated. Patients were grouped according to the threshold value of the CXR score, and demographic data and other recorded parameters were compared. RESULTS: A total of 301 patients were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. It was determined that finding of a CXR score threshold value of 5 or above during hospitalization predicted a transfer to the ICU with 90% sensitivity and 80% specificity. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, the laboratory parameters (leukocyte, neutrophil, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, troponin, D-dimer, ferritin), and rate of transfer to ICU were found to be significantly higher in the group with a CXR score of 5 and above, compared to the group with CXR score below 5 (P &lt; .001 in each). CONCLUSION: Finding high CXR scores during hospitalization due to COVID-19 may act as a warning in terms of the severity of the disease. It may be beneficial to examine the chest X-ray images during hospitalization with utmost care and take these images into account.","Selma Aydoğan, Eroğlu Çagavi Zeynep Tekin Yıldız Karakurt Zuhal On behalf of Covid Interest Group",Turk Toraks Dergisi,https://doi.org/10.5152/turkthoracj.2021.21025,697

173329,Emily Bronte and the Strategic Art of Social Distancing,2021,"Authorship verification (AV) is a fundamental research task in digital text forensics, which addresses the problem of whether two texts were written by the same person. In recent years, a variety of AV methods have been proposed that focus on this problem and can be divided into two categories: The first category refers to such methods that are based on explicitly defined features, where one has full control over which features are considered and what they actually represent. The second category, on the other hand, relates to such AV methods that are based on implicitly defined features, where no control mechanism is involved, so that any character sequence in a text can serve as a potential feature. However, AV methods belonging to the second category bear the risk that the topic of the texts may bias their classification predictions, which in turn may lead to misleading conclusions regarding their results. To tackle this problem, we propose a preprocessing technique called POSNoise, which effectively masks topic-related content in a given text. In this way, AV methods are forced to focus on such text units that are more related to the writing style. Our empirical evaluation based on six AV methods (falling into the second category) and seven corpora shows that POSNoise leads to better results compared to a well-known topic masking approach in 34 out of 42 cases, with an increase in accuracy of up to 10%.","Halvani, Oren; Graner, Lukas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06605v2.pdf,697

Patients with diabetes who test positive for COVID-19 have a higher mortality rate than the general population. In this audit, patients treated for DKA in SVUH in March-April 2020 were identified and their records were reviewed to assess adherance to the DKA protocol. Patients treated for DKA during March-April 2019 were used as a comparison population. There were 10 cases of DKA in SVUH in March-April 2020. 10% were under the care of the Endocrinology team. 50% were prescribed appropriate basal insulin. 60% were prescribed appropriate fluids. 60% were admitted via the COVID pathway. 50% were prescribed appropriate fluids, compared to 75% of patients who were admitted via the non-COVID pathway. 50% of patients on both pathways were prescribed appropriate basal insulin. In March-April 2019 there were 9 cases of DKA in SVUH. 66% were directly under the care of the Endocrinology team. 88% were prescribed appropriate insulin. 77% were prescribed appropriate fluids. This work was re-audited to assess adherance to the DKA protocol in September-October 2020, when community rates of COVID-19 were lower and staff had been re-educated on DKA management. 8 patients were treated for DKA in September-October 2020. All of these patients were admitted via the non-COVID pathway. 87.5% were under the care of the Endocrinology team. 75% received appropriate basal insulin and 87.5% received appropriate fluids. In conclusion, adherence to the DKA protocol was suboptimal in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adherance to the DKA protocol improved to baseline in September-October 2020. This was largely attributed to the fact that patients were not admitted through the COVID pathway, and that they were directly under the care of Endocrinology. It is imperative that patients with speciality specific problems are managed by the appropriate discipline, as COVID-19 remains a significant public health crisis.","McCcarthy, A.

A similar change is historically tangible after a massive external shock to the economy. The terms ""external shock to the economy"" and ""pandemic"" as an external economic shock have been clarified. The paper examines significant historical cases and periods in which a general and radical change took place, and the renewal of the business environment and business models as a result of external shocks to the economy. The view is presented that the Covid pandemic as an external shock is a catalyst for a change of environment and change of business models, leading to the forefront in the practice of new business models. The hypothesis of possible polar business models is considered, based on a summary of distant historical and recent experience in the specific business ecosystem and the algorithm of change. As a result of the study, it was concluded that the change, including in the business models including those in the tourism sector, will most likely require the implementation of self-created club beta versions and ""ambidextrous"" business models on the one hand and business models based on state entrepreneurship.

To date, the pathogenetic role of aPL and the trend over time is still unknown. Objectives: Aim of the study was to investigate whether aPL positivity was correlated with thrombosis in COVID-19 patients and whether it was a transient or persistent. Methods: We included all consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University of Rome from April 1, 2020 to June 7, 2020. In these patients, serum levels of anti-cardiolipin (aCL) IgM, IgG, IgA, anti-β2glycoprotein I (aβ2GPI) IgM, IgG were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) was detected with coagulatory tests in patients not in treatment with anticoagulant drugs. Results: Five out of 73 (6.8%) patients resulted positive for aCL IgM, 3 of them also tested positive for aβ2GPI IgM. aCL IgA were tested positive in 14 out of 46 patients (30.4%). Overall 18 patients resulted positive for at least one test. Seven (9.6%) patients developed thrombotic events during hospitalization, 3 of them resulting positive for aPL (Table 1. below). We observed that patients showing double positivity for aCL IgM and aβ2GPI IgM had a likelihood positive ratio of 6.3 for thrombotic events (p=0.012) and a likelihood positive ratio of 4.9 for increased D-dimer levels (p=0.027). aCL IgA, the most prevalent aPL in this cohort, was not associated with thrombosis. Of the 18 aPL positive patients, 5 died, 3 were lost to follow-up, and 10 were tested on a second occasion at least 12 weeks, two patients confirmed positivity without clinical signs suggestive of APS. Conclusion: These results suggest that double positivity for aCL and aβ2GPI IgM increases the risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients, unlike aCL IgA. APL positivity may be persistent and it is advisable to monitor it over time.","Mancuso, S.; Truglia, S.; Capozzi, A.; Pasquali, F.; Recalchi, S.; Riitano, G.; Spinelli, F.

When compared with an approach based on Hamming distance, ImputeCoVNet achieved comparable results with significantly less computation time. We also present the provision of geographical metadata (e.g., exposed country) to decoder increases the imputation accuracy. Additionally, by visualizing the embedding results of SARS-CoV-2 variants, we show that the trained encoder of ImputeCoVNet, or the embedded results from it, recapitulates viral clade’s information, which means it could be used for predictive tasks using virus sequence analysis.","Pesaranghader, Ahmad; Pelletier, Justin; Grenier, Jean-Christophe; Poujol, Raphaël; Hussin, Julie",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.13.456305,697

175356,"Understanding the Drivers of Mobility during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Florida, USA Using a Machine Learning Approach",2021,"Pandemics are stressful times, full of uncertainty and fear. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many Americans have experienced feelings of stress, grief, and loss. How Right Now (HRN) – and its Spanish-language counterpart, Qué Hacer Ahora (QHA) – is an evidence-based, culturally-relevant communication campaign designed to promote and strengthen the emotional well-being and resiliency of populations adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with support from the CDC Foundation, the campaign aims to help all Americans but has a specific focus on some of the disproportionately affected groups, including adults over 65 and their caregivers, individuals with pre-existing physical and mental health conditions, people experiencing violence, and those experiencing economic distress. Based on rapid, but robust, formative research, HRN offers audience-centric messages representing the real, everyday experiences and emotions that these audiences are having and addresses them in actionable ways. These include messages that address the social and structural barrier that disproportionately-affected groups have been facing long before the pandemic — and which are felt more acutely now. This paper provides an overview of the rapid, mixed-method, culturally-responsive formative research process undertaken to inform the development of HRN. Specifically, it describes how HRN’s disproportionately-affected audiences describe and discuss their emotiona well-being during COVID-19 through the lens of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). We introduce a secondary theory, Vital Conditions for Health and Well-Being (VCHW), which conceptualizes holistic well-being and the conditions that give rise to it and identifies levers for community change and improvement. Data collection methods included an environmental scan (n≥700 publications);social listening (n≥1 million social media posts);partner needs-assessment calls (n=16);partner-convened listening sessions with community members (n=29), online focus groups (n=10), and a national probability survey (n=731), all in English and Spanish. Findings suggest that HRN’s priority audiences’ emotional well-being and SDOH are interconnected. Disruptions in SDOH du to the COVID-19 pandemic can lead to emotional well-being challenges (e.g., anxiety) for HRN’s priority audiences. While some disruptions may lead some people to adapt, connect with others, and be more resilient, there is a disparate impact of emotional well-being amid COVID-19 for those already experiencing disparities linked to SDOH. Understanding the perspectives and experiences of disproportionately affected populations through the lens of SDOH is vital to identifying the kinds of supports and services – like How Right Now/Qué Hacer Ahora – required for these populations. © 2021 Weston Medical Publishing.

We use annual cause-of-death data to produce death rates for common types of cancer in select high-income countries. We find that cancer mortality patterns parallel the epidemiologic transition, which states that as countries advance, they move from a regime where infectious diseases are most common to one where non-infectious disease are most common. An implication is that the epidemiologic transition theory as originally formulated continues to be relevant despite some researchers arguing that we need additional stages beyond the original three.","Gersten, O.; Barbieri, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.25.20238832v1?rss=1,697

The study was conducted with the Perceived Stress Scale (10-items) amidst the first wave of COVID-19 in Russia, in May 2020.ResultsNo significant differences were found in the stress levels between the two groups of healthcare providers. On average, the sample revealed an increased level of stress (15.4 with standard values of 12-13). The general indicator of perceived stress (F = 13.471;p <0.001), stress level (F = 12.333;p = 0.001) and stress resistance (F = 6.003;p = 0.015) in women is significantly higher than in men. In addition, women working with COVID-19 patients have a higher level of stress resistance than women working with other patients (F = 3.432;p = 0.045).ConclusionsThe perception of stress by healthcare staff during the COVID-19 pandemic increases independently on whether or not they work with infected patients. Although stress is higher in women, they are better at coping, especially in extreme situations.

(Special Issue: COVID-19 and tourism.),2021,"Objective: This study aimed to determine the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigens and IgM and IgG antibodies in breast milk of mothers diagnosed with Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Methods: The study was conducted in 11 mother-child pairs. Breastfeeding mothers who were either positive according to a PCR test or those who were negative but had COVID symptoms were included in the study. Expressed milk was stored at -20/-80 degrees C until analysis. Breastmilk SARS-CoV-2 antigens and IgM and IgG antibodies were measured. The infants were followed for at least 15 days. Results: SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests using a nasopharyngeal swab was positive in 10 of 11 mothers. Nine mothers had symptoms of COVID-19. Breast milk samples were taken, on average, 15 days after symptom onset or a positive PCR result. SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests using a nasopharyngeal swab was positive in seven infants. The SARS-CoV-2 antigen was not detected in the breast milk of any of the mothers. However, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were detected in the breast milk of two mothers, who had a positive PCR test and experienced clinical symptoms. The children of these two mothers experienced no symptoms. Conclusion: Official institutions have recommended and supported breastfeeding during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

To avoid system collapse, governments have resorted to several social distancing measures. In Belgium, this included a lockdown and a following period of phased re-opening. Methods: A representative sample of Belgian adults was asked about their contact behaviour from mid-April to mid-July, during different stages of the intervention measures in Belgium. Use of personal protection equipment (face masks) and compliance to hygienic measures was also reported. We estimated the expected reproduction number computing the ratio of R0 with respect to pre-pandemic data. Results: During the first two waves (the first month) of the survey, the reduction in the average number of contacts was around 80% and was quite consistent across all age-classes. The average number of contacts increased over time, particularly for the younger age classes, still remaining significantly lower than pre-pandemic values. Since the end of May, the estimated reproduction number has a median value larger than one, although with a wide dispersion. Conclusions: We have shown how a rapidly deployed survey can measure compliance to social distancing and assess its impact on COVID-19 spread. Monitoring the effectiveness of social distancing recommendations is of paramount importance to avoid further waves of COVID-19.","Coletti, P.; Wambua, J.; Gimma, A.; Willem, L.; Vercruysse, S.; Vanhoutte, B.; Jarvis, C.

176117,"Post-COVID-19 Adaptations;the Shifts Towards Online Learning, Hybrid Course Delivery and the Implications for Biosciences Courses in the Higher Education Setting",2021,"Background: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) accounted for nearly 1.71 billion people worldwide in 2019 with an estimate of over 126.6 million Americans (or one in two adults) affected and 40 million European workers in 2017. Since age constitutes an important risk factor for MSDs, the overall aging of the working population is expected to influence the burden of disease. However, factors other than aging may play a role in the global trends in MSDs We conducted a systematic review to summarize the evidence on the role of demographic and temporal changes in the occurrence of MSDs. Methods: The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO with the number CRD42020221499. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, ScienceDirect and Web of Science over the 1990-2020 period for articles reporting temporal trends in MSDs incidence or prevalence in the general working-age population. We only included articles controlling for age in the analysis. To ensure the quality of the articles, the bias risk was assessed using the RoB-SPEO tool. The main indicators we extracted were age-controlled time trends in MSDs incidence or prevalence. Results: Among 966 articles, 16 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, representing 23 results according to the indicators extracted. No study was found with a high risk of bias. Nine used a definition of MSDs based on pain and 14 based on repercussions on work or social life. Twelve results presented time trends in prevalence and 11 in incidence. After controlling for age, temporal trends in MSDs presented some heterogeneity. Indeed, 10 results documented increases and 12 reported non-monotonic changes. Only 1 result reported a decreasing trend in the incidence of MSDs. Several factors other than aging were suggested to explain temporal trends in MSDs, mainly trends in obesity, changing occupational exposures, and cultural factors regarding pain tolerance. Conclusion: This review shows that factors in addition to aging of the working population may contribute to varying or increasing trends in MSDs. Results also highlight the scarcity of available evidence on time trends in the burden of MSDs and their underlying causes.","Bouziri, H.; Descatha, A.; Roquelaure, Y.; Dab, W.; Jean, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.20.21263840v1?rss=1,697

Here, we report a comprehensive interaction map between Tax-1 and human PDZ domain-containing proteins (hPDZome), and we show that Tax-1 interacts with one-third of them. This includes proteins involved in cell cycle, cell-cell junction and cytoskeleton organization, as well as in membrane complexes assembly. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we have determined the structural basis of the interaction between the C-terminal PDZ binding motif (PBM) of Tax-1, and the PDZ domains of DLG1 and syntenin-1. Finally, we have used molecular modeling and mammalian cell-based assays to demonstrate that Tax-1/PDZ-domain interactions are amenable to small-molecule inhibition.

177193,The Philippine Higher Education Sector in the Time of COVID-19,2020,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) colonizes the nasopharynx of children and the elderly but also kills millions worldwide yearly. The secondary bile acid metabolite, deoxycholic acid (DoC), affects the viability of human pathogens but also plays multiple roles in host physiology. We assessed in vitro the antimicrobial activity of DoC and investigated its potential to eradicate Spn colonization using an ex vivo model of human nasopharyngeal colonization and an in vivo mouse model of colonization. At a physiological concentration DoC (0.5 mg/ml; 1.27 mM) killed all tested Spn strains (N=48) two h post-inoculation. The ex-vivo model of nasopharyngeal colonization showed that DoC eradicated colonization by Spn strains as soon as 10 min post-exposure. The mechanism of action did not involve activation of autolysis since the autolysis-defective double mutants ΔlytAΔlytC and ΔspxBΔlctO were as susceptible to DoC as was the wild-type (WT). Oral streptococcal species (N=20), however, were not susceptible to DoC (0.5 mg/ml). Unlike trimethoprim, whose spontaneous resistance frequency (srF) for TIGR4 or EF3030 was ≥1×10−9, no spontaneous resistance was observed with DoC (srF≥1×10−12). Finally, the efficacy of DoC to eradicate Spn colonization was assessed in vivo using a topical route via intranasal (i.n.) administration and as a prophylactic treatment. Mice challenged with Spn EF3030 carried a median of 4.05×105 cfu/ml four days post-inoculation compared to 6.67×104 cfu/ml for mice treated with DoC. Mice in the prophylactic group had a ∼99% reduction of the pneumococcal density (median, 2.61 ×103 cfu/ml). Thus, DoC, an endogenous human bile salt, has therapeutic potential against Spn.","Vidal, Jorge E.; Wier, Meagan N.; Angulo-Zamudio, Uriel; McDevitt, Erin; Jop Vidal, Ana G.; Alibayov, Babek; Scasny, Anna; Wong, Sandy M.; Akerley, Brian J.; McDaniel, Larry S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.17.444594,697

Recently our group showed common derangement observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and COVID-19 (2). In RA, synovium attracts potentially autoreactive-B cells and plasma cells that play a central role in RA pathogenesis (3). We were interested to know the similarity in B cell's transcriptomic changes specific to RA and COVID-19. Objectives: Identify similar upregulated genes in synovium and B cells in RA and at the same time are differentially expressed in B cells infected with SARSCoV-2 or from COVID-19 patients. Methods: RNAseq dataset (GSE89408) of (218) samples isolated from joint synovial biopsies from subjects with and without rheumatoid arthritis were retrieved from GEO online database. Differentially expressed genes (DRGs) specific to RA were identified after exclusion of those upregulated in Osteoarthritis or other joint condition samples in the same dataset. The RA specific genes were intersected with DEGs between B cells from healthy versus RA as extracted from (GSE110999) dataset. The shortlisted genes specifically upregulated in B cells of RA were identified and were explored in B cells COVID-19 transcriptome datasets using (https://metascape.org/COVID). Results: 60 genes were found to be specifically upregulated in RA synovium and B cells and are changed in B cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 or from COVID-19 patients, Figure (1-A). Those genes were involved in interferon signaling, antiviral and immune cell activation. RASGRP1 was common between B cells of RA and COVID-19 and might play a role in the pathogenesis of both, Figure (1-B). RASGRP1 controls ERK/MAPK kinase cascade needed in B-/T-cell differentiation and development. It is vital to protect against viral infection and the autoimmune associated proliferation of activated T-cells like RA (4). We checked its level in another dataset (GSE152641) of the whole blood RNASeq of 62 COVID-19 patients and 24 healthy controls. RASGRP1 was significantly down in COVID-19 compared to healthy control, Figure (1-C). Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 impair B and T's cells' immune response through its action on RASGRP1 and that can be a novel mechanistic explanation of how the virus decreases immune cells and impair the B cell's humoral immunity.","Hannawi, S.; Alqutami, F.; Hachim, M.

Revised consensus treatment guidelines were generated. Individual patient-level data regarding actual treatment modifications implemented in clinical practice are lacking. Methods: All anti-cancer treatment plans of patients with breast, lung, renal, hepatopancreatobiliary, CNS cancers and melanoma attending a single academic cancer centre in the UK between 16 March and 31 May 2020 were reviewed and any modifications to standard practice were documented. The effect of patient (age, ECOG performance status [PS], sex) and cancer (site, stage, treatment intent) characteristics on likelihood of treatment modifications were analysed using univariable and multivariable models. Results: Treatment plans for 925 patients were reviewed: median patient age was 63 (range 19-97);66% were female;73% were PS 0-1;45% were on a curative pathway. Overall, 47% of all patients had one or more modifications made to their treatment plans: 53% of surgeries (primarily being delayed);41% of radiotherapy (primarily reduced fractions delivered);39% of systemic therapy prescriptions. 96-100% of all systemic therapy modifications resulted in treatment deescalation, excluding endocrine therapy used as a bridge to defer primary breast cancer surgery. Biological therapy was predominantly interrupted (49%), immunotherapy was mostly omitted entirely (36%), and chemotherapy varied between interruptions (39%) or omissions (31%). Relative to the likelihood of modification to chemotherapy, surgery was significantly more likely to be modified (OR 1.69 95%CI 1.20-2.38). Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biological therapy and immunotherapy were all modified to a similar degree. Multivariate analysis identified PS ≥2 (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.18- 2.75), but not patient age, as a predictor of treatment modification. Some tumour types were less likely to undergo any modification: stage 1-3 lung (OR 0.13, 95%CI 0.04-0.37), stage 4 lung (OR 0.26 95%CI 0.24-0.60) and stage 4 renal cancer (OR 0.22 95%CI 0.09-0.52). Conclusions: This single centre analysis demonstrated almost half of cancer patients had their treatment modified, the overwhelming majority resulting in treatment de-escalation.

The mechanism of exposure to droplets expired at close contact, however, remains surprisingly unexplored. In this study, the exposure to exhaled droplets during close contact (< 2 m) via both the short-range airborne and large droplet sub-routes is studied using a simple mathematical model of expired flows and droplet dispersion/deposition/inhalation, which enables the calculation of exposure due to both deposition and inhalation. The short-range airborne route is found to dominate at most distances studied during both talking and coughing. The large droplet route only dominates when the droplets are larger than 100 m and when the subjects are within 0.2 m while talking or 0.5 m while coughing. The smaller the exhaled droplets, the more important the short-range airborne route. The large droplet route contributes less than 10% of exposure when the droplets are smaller than 50 m and when the subjects are more than 0.3 m apart, even while coughing. Practical implicationsOur simple but novel analysis shows that conventional surgical masks are not effective if most infectious viruses are contained in fine droplets, and non-conventional intervention methods such as personalised ventilation should be considered as infection prevention strategies given the possible dominance of the short-range airborne route, although further clinical evidence is needed.

Resilience becomes the high-powered important mechanism that reduces stress impact on the emotional state of healthcare professionals.ObjectivesWe suggested that effective resilience is associated with less COVID-19’s fear, as well as less anxiety, and depression;healthcare professionals’ mental health depends on age, gender, as well as involvement in the care of patients with COVID-19.Methods211 healthcare professionals participated in the study and were evaluated with the Connor-Davidson Resilience 10-item scale (CD-RISC-10), Fear of COVID-19 Scale, PHQ-9, GAD-7.ResultsA negative correlation between resilience and fear of COVID-19 (p≤0,01), anxiety (p≤0,01), and depression (p≤0,001) was found. Positive correlations were found between depression, anxiety, and fear of COVID-19 (p≤0,001), between age and fear of COVID-19 (p≤0,05). No statistically significant association between age and depression, anxiety, or resilience was found. The significant difference of COVID-19 fear depending on gender – female vs male (p≤0,05) was found. No statistically significant difference in resilience and emotional state in healthcare professionals depending on the involvement in the care of patients with COVID-19 were found.ConclusionsResilience is associated with better mental health in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety and depression are connected with the fear of COVID-19 and highly comorbid in healthcare professionals. The elder age and female gender are among the risk factors for a more deteriorated mental state. Fear of COVID-19, mental state, and resilience are not associated with healthcare professionals’ involvement in the care of patients with COVID-19.","Khaustova, O.; Chaban, O.; Assonov, D.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.720,697

The pandemic has led to profound changes in social interaction and organization in postsecondary education. The pandemic required that institutions respond with ?emergency eLearning? or remote learning protocols, moving quickly from face-to-face, in-person classes to online learning systems. This move disproportionately impacted HBCUs, which traditionally serve low-income, first-generation students, many of whom lack access to needed resources and technology. This article examines how communications programs at HBCUs have fared in the emergency move to online teaching while serving an at-risk population for the coronavirus. It will discuss the pedagogical approach and process by which these primarily ACEJMC-accredited journalism programs moved courses online and attempted to train hundreds of faculty to teach online within days of expanding lockdown orders in mid-March through the end of 2020.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, covering of the face, except the eyes, has become the norm for the first time for most people. Social interactions and clinical observation rely heavily on non-verbal communication of which facial expression is of utmost importance. While clinicians, especially in mental health settings, are acutely aware of the loss of information transmitted through the lower half of the face, signs of tardive dyskinesia may be forgotten in the list of potentially missed information.ObjectivesTo reflect on possible failure to detect orobuccolingual movements of tardive dyskinesia due to use of facial masks.MethodsReflection on a clinical case of a patient with a treatment refractory psychosis who presents to an outpatient appointment with a facial mask. After the appointment, a family member transmitted having observed what appeared to be involuntary masticatory movements in the patient.ResultsFacial masks and coverings occult signs that may be visible on the lower half of the face.ConclusionsFacial masks and coverings are essential in preventing COVID-19 contagion. Clinicians must keep in mind loss of information when part of the face is not visible. Tardive dyskinesia with orobuccolingual movements may be missed behind a mask.

Due to universities short notice closure, synchronous online instruction through videoconferencing platforms has been the favoured choice for most instructors. In this paper, we report on our experience teaching an online course using Zoom videoconferencing platform. We conduct a two-fold analysis of online synchronous teaching: 1) We first compare the engagement and feedback features offered by Zoom with traditional classroom interactions. We show that some features are challenging to transpose to traditional face-to-face classroom setting while others may require additional hardware and software. 2) We analyze Zoom's attention tracker tool and evaluate the effectiveness of the attentiveness score as an effective grading metric.

In this randomised placebo-controlled trial, participants were given daily physiological doses (15 g) of either vitamin D2 or D3 for 12 weeks and changes in the transcriptome were compared relative to the transcriptome at baseline. While there was some overlap in the repertoire of differentially expressed genes after supplementation with each vitamin D source, most changes were specific to either vitamin D3 or vitamin D2, suggesting that each form of the vitamin may have different effects on human physiology. Notably, following vitamin D3 supplementation, the majority of changes in gene expression reflected a down-regulation in the activity of genes, many encoding components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. These are consistent with the emerging concept that vitamin D orchestrates a shift in the immune system towards a more tolerogenic status. The profound differences in gene expression after supplementation with vitamin D2 compared with vitamin D3 warrant a more intensive investigation of the biological effects of the two forms of vitamin D on human physiology.","Durrant, L.

178907,The social media response to twice-weekly mass asymptomatic testing in England,2021-08-21,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic created the need for very large scale, rapid testing to prevent and contain transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Lateral flow device (LFD) immunoassays meet this need by indicating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen from nose/throat swab washings in 30 minutes without laboratory processing, and can be manufactured quickly at low cost. Since March 2021, UK schools have asked pupils without symptoms to test twice weekly. Pupils have posted on social media about using soft drinks to create positive results. The aim of this study was to systematically test a variety soft drinks to determine whether they can cause false false positive LFD results. Methods This study used 14 soft drinks and 4 artificial sweeteners to determine the outcome of misusing them as analyte for the Innova SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid qualitative LFD. The pH value, sugar content and ingredients of each sample are described. The LFD results were double read and a subset was repeated using the same devices and fake analytes but differently sourced. Findings One sample (1/14; 7%), spring water, produced a negative result. Ten drinks (10/14; 71%) produced a positive or weakly positive result. Three samples (3/14; 21%) produced void results, mostly the fruit concentrate drinks. There was no apparent correlation between the pH value (pH 5.0 in 13/14, 93%; pH 6.5 in 1/14; 7%) or the sugar content (range 0-10.7 grams per 100mls) of the drinks and their LFD result. The 4 artificial sweeteners all produced negative results. A subset of the results was fully replicated with differently sourced materials. Interpretation Several soft drinks can be misused to give false positive SARS-CoV-2 LFD results. Daily LFD testing should be performed first thing in the morning, prior to the consumption of any food or drinks, and supervised where feasible.

Given their density and available infrastructure, refugee and internally displaced person (IDP) settlements can be particularly susceptible to disease spread. Non-pharmaceutical public health interventions can be used to mitigate transmission, and modeling efforts can provide crucial insights on the potential effectiveness of such interventions to help inform decision making processes. In this paper we present an agent-based modeling approach to simulating the spread of disease in refugee and IDP settlements. The model, based on the JUNE open-source framework, is informed by data on geography, demographics, comorbidities, physical infrastructure and other parameters obtained from real-world observations and previous literature. Furthermore, we present a visual analytics tool which allows decision makers to distill insights by comparing the results of different simulations and scenarios. Through simulating their effects on the epidemiological development of COVID-19, we evaluate several public health interventions ranging from increasing mask wearing compliance to the reopening of learning institutions. The development and testing of this approach focuses on the Cox's Bazar refugee settlement in Bangladesh, although our model is designed to be generalizable to other informal settings.","Bullock, J.; Cuesta-Lazaro, C.; Quera-Bofarull, A.; Katta, A.; Hoffmann Pham, K.; Hoover, B.; Strobelt, H.; Moreno Jimenez, R.; Sedgewick, A.; Samir Evers, E.; Kennedy, D.; Harlass, S.; Gidraf Kahindo Maina, A.; Hussien, A.; Luengo-Oroz, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250611v1?rss=1,697

Material and Methods: Within the scope of this single-center retrospective clinical study, data of possible and definite cases of COVID-19 were scanned from the hospital electronic database and patient files. Laboratory and CT imaging results of the patients were obtained. Patients were divided into two groups as positive and negative according to their CT imaging results, and compared. Results: Of the 995 patients included in the study, 57% (n=567) were male, and the mean age was 45.7±20.2 years. It was found that 65.1% (n=648) of the patients had positive CT. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result was found positive in 22.2% (n=144) of the CT positive patients, and 32.0% (n=111) of the CT negative patients, and it was statistically significant (p<0.001). In the logistic regression analysis, it was determined that C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocyte count, ferritin, procalcitonin, D-dimer, lactate and RT-PCR were statistically significant with CT positivity. Conclusion: In this study, COVID-19 positive and probable patients were compared according to thoracic CT findings and the usability of CT for clinical decision making was investigated. It has been determined that thorax CT can be used to initiate the treatment of COVID-19 in patients with negative RT-PCR test results but positive CT findings and high biochemical parameters such as CRP, D-dimer, ferritin and lactate.","Tekin, E.; Bayraktar, M.; Gür, A.; Özlü, I.",Duzce Medical Journal,https://doi.org/10.18678/dtfd.940877,697

This has brought the organisational practice of downsizing into sharp relief. Responsible downsizing is broadly understood as the actions, practices and strategies adopted by organisations to ameliorate the negative effects of redundancy. The paper draws on HR theories of best practice and best fit to explore the phenomenon of responsible downsizing, as a dominant focus in extant literature is the identification of ‘responsible’ best practices. In challenging these prevailing assumptions, this paper contends that responsible downsizing is more usefully understood as theoretically underpinned by a best fit approach. While there is value in adopting best practices the paper argues that greater attention should be paid to how organisational, societal and institutional contexts shape their implementation. Based on a review of 44 empirical articles, the paper advances a framework for responsible downsizing. The framework establishes four types of responsibility: regulatory, procedural, communication and employment responsibilities.

Methods: Twenty-four healthy volunteers receiving 5 daily oral doses of 10 mg aripiprazole and 5 mg olanzapine in a crossover clinical trial were genotyped for 46 polymorphisms in 14 genes by qPCR. Drug plasma concentrations were measured by HPLC-MS/MS. Blood pressure and 12-lead ECG were measured in supine position. Adverse events were also recorded. Results: Aripiprazole decreased diastolic blood pressure on the first day and decreased QTc on the third and fifth day. Olanzapine had a systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and QTc lowering effect on the first day. Polymorphisms in ADRA2A, COMT, DRD3 and HTR2A genes were significantly associated to these changes. The most frequent adverse drug reactions to aripiprazole were somnolence, headache, insomnia, dizziness, restlessness, palpitations, akathisia and nausea while were somnolence, dizziness, asthenia, constipation, dry mouth, headache and nausea to olanzapine. Additionally, HTR2A, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, OPRM1, UGT1A1 and CYP1A2 polymorphisms had a role in the development of adverse drug reactions.

Whether there are differences between HF phenotypes in the pattern of admissions is not known. We explored the frequency, causes, and pattern of hospitalisation for patients with HF in the 12 months preceding death. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of patients recruited prospectively over two decades at a community HF clinic in Kingston upon Hull, UK. Patients with HF who died before August 2020 were included. We divided the cohort into three phenotypes: i) heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HeFREF), ii) heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HeFNEF) with N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) 125-399 ng/L, and iii) HeFNEF with NTproBNP ≥400 ng/L. The primary outcome was hospital admissions in the last year of life, classified as: HF, other cardiovascular (CV), or non-cardiovascular (non-CV). The primary cause of hospital admission using ICD-10 criteria was used. Results Among 4925 patients, the median (Q1-Q3) age at death was 81 (75-87). 38% of patients were female. There were 9127 hospital admissions. The median (Q1-Q3) number of hospitalisations per patient was 2 (1-3) and days spent in hospital in the last year of life was 12 (2-25). 83% of patients had at least one hospitalisation;20% had at least one HF hospitalisation;24% had at least one CV hospitalisation;70% had at least one non-CV hospitalisation. 54% of deaths were as an in-patient. HF admissions were a minority in all phenotypes, but most common in HeFREF. In each group, at least two thirds of admissions were non-CV. 6% of the admissions in 2020 (prior to August) were for COVID-19. Hospitalisations increased in the three months prior to death (figure 1). Conclusion In the last year of life in patients with HF, most hospitalisations are for non-CV causes regardless of HF phenotype.","Abel, A.; Samuel, N.; Cuthbert, J.; Kazmi, S.; Cleland, J.; Clark, A.",Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2021-bcs.117,697
180819,Shouting Into the Wind: Medical Science versus “B.S.” in the Twitter Maelstrom of Politics and Misinformation About Hydroxychloroquine,2021,"Projections of future global human population are traditionally made using birth/death trend extrapolations, but these methods ignore limits. Expressing humanity as a K-selected species whose numbers are limited by the global carrying capacity produces a different outlook. Population data for the second millennium up to the year 1970 was fit to a hyper-exponential growth equation, where the rate constant for growth itself grows exponentially due to growth of life-saving technology. The discrepancies between the projected growth and the actual population data since 1970 are accounted for by a decrease in the global carrying capacity due to ecosystem degradation. A system dynamics model that best fits recent population numbers suggests that the global biocapacity may already have been reduced to one-half of its historical value and global carrying capacity may be at its 1965 level and falling. Simulations suggest that population may soon peak or may have already peaked. Population projections depend strongly on the unknown fragility or robustness of the Earth’s essential ecosystem services that affect agricultural production. Numbers for the 2020 global census were not available for this study.","Bystroff, Christopher",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.04.429734,697

181130,Shifting towards Online Assessment: A New Promising Gate in the Higher Educational Level,2021,"Importance SARS-CoV-2 infection directly causes severe acute respiratory illness, leading to systemic tissue hypoxia and ischemia including the heart. Myocardial cytopathy associated with hypoxic response has been largely overlooked in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, histology analysis and cardiac function of COVID-19 cases are often reported separately, rendering an incomplete understanding of COVID-19 cardiac symptoms. Objective To examine the relationship between myocardial cellular responses to hypoxic stress versus cardiac functional alterations within the same COVID-19 patients. Design, Setting, and Participants Cellular hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 alpha (HIF1) expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using post-mortem COVID-19 heart and lung tissues with known cardiac echocardiography records from a total of 8 patients. Clinical echocardiography data were obtained from Mount Sinai Heart between March to December, 2020. All gender and age groups were considered as long as cardiac involvement meets the preserved (EF > 50%) or moderate to severe (EF < 45%) criteria with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cell-type specific subcellular localization of HIF1 expression and nuclear stability was examined by immunohistochemistry and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was used to quantify apoptosis. Main Outcomes and Measures No planned outcomes of this study as this is a retrospective analysis based on post-mortem specimens exclusively. Results Cardiac HIF1 expression was found to be significantly higher in patients with preserved EF levels than it was in the low EF group. In the preserved EF group, HIF1 is protective against apoptosis predominantly in endothelial cells and cardiac fibroblasts. In the low EF group, HIF1 protects cardiomyocyte nuclear integrity as evident by its nuclear accumulation with nuclear envelope preservation. Conclusions and Relevance This study establishes a direct link of cardiac cellular responses to hypoxic stress with matching functional and histological data, serving as one of the first studies to bridge previous stand-alone clinical data and cellular data. The protective role of HIF1 in hearts may help predict cardiac involvement in not only COVID-19 patients, but also decipher the underlying mechanisms in other forms of viral cardiomyopathy.","Wang, B.

Aims This study aims to investigate the effect of the temporal changes of lipid levels on the prognosis during the course of the disease. Study design Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods For this single-center study, data of patients who were treated for COVID-19 were collected. Fasting lipid parameters including total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) levels were collected within 24 h of hospitalization. For investigation of temoral changes in lipid parameters, the results of the same parameters in the one-year period before COVID-19 were collected from medical records. A total number of 324 eligible COVID-19 patients were included in this study. The association of changes of lipid parameters with COVID-19 symptom severity and in-hospital mortality were investigated. Results The mean age of the severe group (n = 139) was 65.4 ± 15.5 years, and 60% were male. TC, LDL-C and HDL-C levels were significantly lower compared to pre-COVID measurements in the study population. Multiple linear regression analysis determined age, acute kidney injury, hs-Troponin, D-dimer, temporal changes in TC, and TG levels were determined as independent predictors for the development of COVID-19 mortality.

181487,New Possibilities in Cultural Consumption. The Effect of the Global Pandemic on Listening to Music,2021,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared to be a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The impact on gastric cancer (GC) surgery is unknown. Various reports have shown data indicating that cancer patients with COVID-19 have high morbidity and mortality rates. The choice of surgical procedures and perioperative management of the patients with malignancy has become even more impornotsigntant in the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the preopartive, intraoperative, and postoperative findings of patients operated for gastric cancer in our clinic.Materials and Methods: We defined the `COVID-19' period as occurring between 12-03-2020 and 31-082020. All the enrolled patients were divided into two groups, pre-COVID-19 group (Pre-CG;64 cases) and COVID-19 group (CG;39 cases). A total of 103 patients with gastric cancer were included in this study. Patient characteristics, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative clinicopathological findings were compared between groups. Results: The waiting times before admission increased in CG (Pre-CG [6.73 +/- 2.85] vs CG [20.61 +/- 5.16];p<0.001). After admission, the waiting time before surgery was longer in CG (Pre-CG [5.06 +/- 3.06] vs CG [6.89 +/- 3.32];p=0.006). No significant difference was detected between the groups in terms of operation time, surgical procedure, combine organ resection, intraoperative blood transfusion requirment (p values, respectively;p=0.108;p=0.951;p=0.204;p=0.597). Postoperative complications were oesophagojejunostomy leak (3/1), atelectasis (2/2), duodenal leak (2/2), ileus (3/0), pleural effusion (2/2), and others (1/1), and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.333). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of hospital stay (p = 0.086) and ICU stay (p = 0.989). Conclusion: In this study, it was seen that the COVID-19 pandemic did not affect morbidity and mortality in gastric cancer surgery, but it prolonged admission waiting and operation waiting times. Since there is very little data in the literature regarding the effect of COVID-19 on gastric cancer surgery, our study will guide future studies on this subject.","Gojayev, A.; Yuksel, C.; Ersen, O.; Celasin, H.; Unal, A.

To date though, the approach has been minimalist and often project specific. The global pandemic, the continuing fallout from Brexit and the establishment of the Shared Island initiative have pushed the broad issue of healthcare cooperation up the policy agenda. Theoretically, closer cooperation could deliver economies of scale, value for money, opportunities for clinical specialisation, and facilitate the sharing of knowledge. However, despite its obvious potential and policy significance, cross-border collaboration in healthcare has been the subject of remarkably little research attention. This small-scale qualitative study is based on in-depth interviews with 49 individuals with expertise and experience in this area. From these interviews six broad themes emerged: support for collaboration, lack of strategic direction, knowledge sharing, Covid-19, data and opportunities for future cooperation. Given the similar social, economic and political pressures faced by both healthcare systems, it is concluded that leveraging the strengths from cross-border collaboration should be a policy priority. © 2021 The Author(s).","Heenan, D.",Irish Studies in International Affairs,https://doi.org/10.3318/isia.2021.32b.43,697

The development of the COVID-19 Epidemiological Data Prediction (EDP) model for India is proposed by using CI-HTR such as Gaussian process regression (GPR) model and shallow neural network models. For that purpose, this analysis uses a time series data set that includes daily cumulative COVID-19 epidemiological data. In order to increase forecast accuracy, hybrid models are constructed by merging Hyper parameter tuned regression models with Non-Linear Auto Regressive (NAR) neural network. Experiential research in this work reveals significant differences between the different types of CI-HTR models for the COVID-19 fatality prediction. The performance metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the correlation factor called ‘R-Value’, are used to estimate the proposed methodology for COVID-19 dataset. It has been found that the hybrid GPR prediction model is the superior to the other models for the COVID-19 EDP. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Dhamodharavadhani, S.; Rathipriya, R.",Studies in Computational Intelligence,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-74761-9_16,697

182335,Preparing Organizations for Greater Turbulence,2021,"In managing COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical interventions, occupancy of intensive care units (ICU) is often used as an indicator to inform when to intensify mitigation and thus reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, strain on ICUs, and deaths. However, ICU occupancy thresholds at which action should be taken are often selected arbitrarily. We propose a quantitative approach using mathematical modeling to identify ICU occupancy thresholds at which mitigation should be triggered to avoid exceeding the ICU capacity available for COVID-19 patients. We used a stochastic compartmental model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression, including critical cases that would require intensive care. We calibrated the model for the United States city of Chicago using daily COVID-19 ICU and hospital census data between March and August 2020. We projected ICU occupancies from September to May 2021 under two possible levels of transmission increase. The effect of combined mitigation measures was modeled as a decrease in the transmission rate that took effect when projected ICU occupancy reached a specified threshold. We found that mitigation did not immediately eliminate the risk of exceeding ICU capacity. Delaying action by 7 days increased the probability of exceeding ICU capacity by 10-60% and this increase could not be counteracted by stronger mitigation. Even under modest transmission increase, a threshold occupancy no higher than 60% was required when mitigation reduced the reproductive number Rt to just below 1. At higher transmission increase, a threshold of at most 40% was required with mitigation that reduced Rt below 0.75 within the first two weeks after mitigation. Our analysis demonstrates a quantitative approach for the selection of ICU occupancy thresholds that considers parameter uncertainty and compares relevant mitigation and transmission scenarios. An appropriate threshold will depend on the location, number of ICU beds available for COVID-19, available mitigation options, feasible mitigation strengths, and tolerated durations of intensified mitigation.","Runge, M.; Richardson, R.

Research has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses have been transmitted from animals to humans and vice versa, and across animal species, and hence, attracted public attention concerning host-virus interactions and transmission ways. Non-human primates (NHPs), as our evolutionary closest relatives, are susceptible to human viruses, and a number of pathogens are known to circulate between humans and NHPs. Here we generated global statistics of virus infection in NHPs (VI-NHPs). In total, 121 NHP species from 14 families have been reported to be infected by 139 DNA and RNA viruses from 23 virus families; 74.8 percent of viruses in NHPs have also been found in humans, indicative of the high potential for cross species transmission of these viruses. The top ten NHP species with high centrality in the NHP-virus network are two apes (Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus), seven Old World monkeys (Macaca mulatta, M. fascicularis, Papio cynocephalus, Lophocebus albigena, Chlorocebus aethiops, Cercopithecus ascanius, C. nictitans) and a lemur (Propithecus diadema). Besides apes, there is a high risk of virus circulation between humans and Old World monkeys, given the wide distribution of many Old World monkey species and their frequent contact with humans. We suggest epidemiological investigations in NHPs, specifically in Old World monkeys with close contact to humans, and other effective measures to prevent this potential circular transmission.","Liu, Zhijin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.089961,697

Vaccination seems to be efficacious and safe for preventing the negative consequences of COVID-19, but vaccine hesitancy seems to be high also in older adults. We therefore aimed to investigate the prevalence of unwillingness and the uncertainty to vaccinate against COVID-19 in older people and the factors that can be associated with the unwillingness to vaccinate. For this work, we searched several databases until 18th June 2021 for studies reporting the prevalence of unwillingness and the uncertainty to vaccinate against COVID-19 in people aged > 60 years. A meta-analysis of the prevalence, with the correspondent 95% confidence intervals (CIs), was proposed. Factors that can be associated with the unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 were explored through multivariable analyses and reported as odds ratios (ORs). Among 662 papers initially screened, we included 15 studies for a total of 9,753 older adults. The prevalence of unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 in older people was 27.03% (95%CI: 15.10-38.95%), whilst the correspondent figure of uncertainty was 19.33% (95%CI: 12.28-26.39).

Although the diagnosis establishment is done by detecting the viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, CT scan has an important role in detection and treatment of COVID-19 especially in high prevalence regions. Chest CT scan has high sensitivity yet low specificity because there are a lot of other pathological spectrums that also present features of COVID-19 such as ground glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation, one of them is CMV infection. The objective of this case report is to raise vigilance towards other diseases that have radiological image similarities with COVID-19, especially in the immunocompromised patients who are susceptible to viral infections like CMV infection so that the delay in the disease treatment can be prevented.","Pitoyo, Ceva Wicaksono; Wijaya, I Putu Eka Krisnha; Wulani, Vally; Wiraputri, Anindita Kartika; Romulo, Michael Aaron",Acta medica Indonesiana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33377883/,697
200288,e-Tourism beyond COVID-19: a call for transformative research,2020,"OBJECTIVE We analyzed serial chest radiographic scores for lung opacification in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) for temporal changes and differences between fatal and discharged cases. We sought to establish the earliest radiographic scores sensitive as potential prognostic indicators of fatal outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chest radiographs that had been obtained from presentation until the death or discharge of 313 patients with SARS were scored on the basis of the percentage area and location of lung opacification. Profile analysis and univariable logistic regression were performed on these radiographic scores. RESULTS Despite the increased mortality risks of advanced age and male sex, no significant difference was seen in the percentage area of opacification (AO%) between the sexes in either the group of patients with fatal outcomes or the group of patients who were discharged. No difference existed between age groups (< 65 years vs >/= 65 years), except for the radiograph showing the peak lung opacification in the deceased group in which the lungs of older patients had less opacification than those of younger patients. The radiographic scores obtained by day 7 were the earliest ones with good performance in prognostic prediction. The model showed good discriminatory performance, indicated by high C-indexes for receiver operator characteristic curves (0.86 for AO% and 0.90 for the number of opacified zones). The predicted proportion of patients with fatal outcomes showed high agreement with percentage of patients who died (goodness-of-fit statistic p = 0.18 for AO%, 0.73 for the number of opacified zones). By day 7, crude odds ratio of death was 1.73 per 5% of AO% (p < 0.0001) or 2.93 per lung zone opacified (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION Chest radiographic scores (percentage of lung or the number of zones opacified) by day 7 could be used as fatal prognostic indicators.","Antonio, Gregory E; Wong, Ka T; Tsui, Eva L H; Chan, David P N; Hui, David S C; Ng, Alex W H; Shing, Kwok K; Yuen, Edmund H Y; Chan, Jane C K; Ahuja, Anil T",AJR.

200590,Education Policy Trump Style: The Administrative Presidency and Deference to States in ESSA Implementation,2020,"Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is a disease of nursery and fattening pigs characterized by growth retardation, paleness of the skin, dyspnea, and increased mortality rates. Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) has been demonstrated to be the cause of PMWS. However, other factors are needed for full development of the syndrome, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection has been suggested to be one of them. Twenty-four conventional 5-week-old pigs were distributed in four groups: control (n = 5), PRRSV inoculated (n = 5), PCV2 inoculated (n = 7), and PRRSV and PCV2 inoculated (n = 7). The two groups inoculated with PRRSV showed growth retardation. Pigs inoculated with both PRRSV and PCV2 had increased rectal temperature. One of these pigs developed wasting, had severe respiratory distress, and died. The most important microscopic lesion in pigs inoculated with PCV2 was lymphocyte depletion with histiocytic infiltration of the lymphoid organs, more severe and in a wider range of tissues in doubly inoculated pigs. Interstitial pneumonia was observed in the three inoculated groups. PCV2 nucleic acid was found by in situ hybridization in larger amounts and in a wider range of lymphoid tissues in PRRSV- and PCV2-inoculated than in PCV2-inoculated pigs. TaqMan PCR was performed to quantify the PCV2 loads in serum during the experiment. PCV2 loads were higher in doubly inoculated pigs than in pigs inoculated with PCV2 alone. These findings indicate that severe disease can be reproduced in conventional 5-week-old pigs by inoculation of PRRSV and PCV2. Moreover, these results support the hypothesis that PRRSV infection enhances PCV2 replication.","Rovira, A; Balasch, M; Segalés, J; García, L; Plana-Durán, J; Rosell, C; Ellerbrok, H; Mankertz, A; Domingo, M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11884547/,697

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of RV infections in patients admitted to the cardiology unit with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in a tertiary hospitals in Singapore. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a single-centre, prospective observational study. A total of 194 adults (aged >21) admitted to the Singapore General Hospital with ADHF were recruited. A nasopharyngeal swab was taken for multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of influenza virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus (HPIV), human coronavirus (HcoV), adenoviurs, human bocavirus (HboV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RESULTS Twenty-five (13%) had RVs detected by RV multiplex PCR. There comprised 9 rhinoviruses (36%), 4 influenza A viruses (16%), 3 HPIV (12%), 3 HCoV (12%), 2 adenoviruses (8%), 1 human HBoV (4%), 1 hMPV (4%), and 1 RSV (4%). Symptoms-wise, cough was significantly more common in the PCR-positive group (48% vs 24%, P = 0.02). There were no statistically significant differences in laboratory investigations (haemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-muscle/brain, troponin T), and radiology findings between RV PCR-positive and -negative groups. The PCR-positive group did not have increased mortality or length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION This study identified a considerable burden of RVs in our ADHF cohort, and highlights the need for prevention of RVs in this group of patients. We also recognised the difficulty with clinical diagnosis of RVs in ADHF patients.","Chan, Candice Yy; Low, Jenny Gh; Wyone, Wyiki; Oon, Lynette LE; Tan, Ban Hock","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30578423/,697

From 11 December 2020 through 12 March 2021, a total of 361,538 service members (27.2%) initiated a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Non-Hispanic Blacks were 28% less likely to initiate vaccination (95% confidence interval: 25%-29%) in comparison to non-Hispanic Whites, after adjusting for potential confounders. Increasing age, higher education levels, higher rank, and Asian/Pacific Islander race/ethnicity were also associated with increasing incidence of initiation after adjustment. When the analysis was restricted to active component health care personnel, similar patterns were seen. Overall, 93.8% of those who initiated the vaccine series completed it during the study period, and only minor differences in completion rates were noted among the demographic subgroups. This study suggests additional factors, such as vaccine hesitancy, influence COVID-19 vaccination choices in the U.S. military. Military leadership and vaccine planners should be knowledgeable about and aware of the disparities in vaccine series initiation.","Lang, Michael A; Stahlman, Shauna; Wells, Natalie Y; Fedgo, Alyssa A; Patel, Deven M; Chauhan, Aparna; Mancuso, James D",MSMR,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33975434/,697

Areas covered: Twelve published studies were identified. Although studies varied substantially in populations, comorbidities examined, methods, and types of cost reported, costs for cancer survivors with comorbidities generally increased with greater numbers of comorbidities or an increase in comorbidity index score. Survivors with comorbidities incurred significantly more in total medical costs, out-of-pocket costs, and costs by service type compared to cancer survivors without additional comorbidities. Expert commentary: Cancer survivors with comorbidities bear significant excess out-of-pocket costs and their care is also more expensive to the healthcare system. On-going evaluation of different payment models, care coordination, and disease management programs for cancer survivors with comorbidities will be important in monitoring impact on healthcare costs.","Rim, Sun Hee; Guy, Gery P; Yabroff, K Robin; McGraw, Kathleen A; Ekwueme, Donatus U",Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27649815/,697
201977,Distance Pedagogical Education in the Conditions of the Coronavirus,2020,"BACKGROUND Despite >20 years of studies investigating the characteristics of patients seeking or receiving opioid analgesics, research characterizing factors associated with physicians' opioid prescribing practices has been inconclusive, and the role of practitioner specialty in opioid prescribing practices remains largely unknown. OBJECTIVE To examine the relationships between physicians' and other providers' primary specialties and their opioid prescribing practices among patients with chronic noncancer pain (CNCP). METHODS Prescriptions for opioids filled by 81,459 Medicaid patients with CNCP in North Carolina (USA), 18 to 64 years of age, enrolled at any point during a one-year study period were examined. χ2<⁄span> statistics were used to examine bivariate differences in prescribing practices according to specialty. For multivariable analyses, maximum-likelihood logistic regression models were used to examine the effect of specialty on prescribing practices, controlling for patients' pain diagnoses and demographic characteristics. RESULTS Of prescriptions filled by patients with CNCP, who constituted 6.4% of the total sample of 1.28 million individuals, 12.0% were for opioids. General practitioner⁄family medicine specialists and internists were least likely to prescribe opioids, and orthopedists were most likely. Across specialties, men were more likely to receive opioids than women, as were white individuals relative to other races⁄ethnicities. In multivariate analyses, all specialties except internal medicine had higher odds of prescribing an opioid than general practitioners: orthopedists, OR 7.1 (95% CI 6.7 to 7.5); dentists, OR 3.5 (95% CI 3.3 to 3.6); and emergency medicine physicians, OR 2.7 (95% CI 2.6 to 2.8). CONCLUSIONS Significant differences in opioid prescribing practices across prescriber specialties may be reflective of differing norms concerning the appropriateness of opioids for the control of chronic pain. If so, sharing these norms across specialties may improve the care of patients with CNCP.","Ringwalt, Chris; Gugelmann, Hallam; Garrettson, Mariana; Dasgupta, Nabarun; Chung, Arlene E; Proescholdbell, Scott K; Skinner, Asheley Cockrell",Pain research & management,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809067/,697
202018,COVID-19: Impacts and perspectives for religious tourism events. The case of Lourdes Pilgrimages,2021,"A cellular protein, previously described as p35/38, binds to the complementary (-)-strand of the leader RNA and intergenic (IG) sequence of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) RNA. The extent of the binding of this protein to IG sites correlates with the efficiency of the subgenomic mRNA transcription from that IG site, suggesting that it is a requisite transcription factor. We have purified this protein and determined by partial peptide sequencing that it is heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1, an abundant, primarily nuclear protein. hnRNP A1 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and plays a role in the regulation of alternative RNA splicing. The MHV(-)-strand leader and IG sequences conform to the consensus binding motifs of hnRNP A1. Recombinant hnRNP A1 bound to these two RNA regions in vitro in a sequence-specific manner. During MHV infection, hnRNP A1 relocalizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where viral replication occurs. These data suggest that hnRNP A1 is a cellular factor that regulates the RNA-dependent RNA transcription of the virus.","Li, H P; Zhang, X; Duncan, R; Comai, L; Lai, M M",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9275159/,697

The disease rapidly crossed the barrier of countries, continents and spread globally. Non-pharmaceutical measures such as social distancing, face mask, frequent hand washing and use of sanitizer remained the best available option to prevent the spread of disease. OPD, IPD admissions, elective O. Ts were curtailed. Orthopedic care was only limited to emergency and semi-urgent procedures like necrotizing fasciitis, open fracture, and compartment syndrome. These measures were taken to preserve infrastructure and manpower to manage covid-19 pandemic. The children were thought to have a low susceptibility to covid-19 as compared to an adult. Deferring the patient during pandemic has led to high orthopedic disease burden, morbidity and disease-related sequelae, hence elective care must be resumed with modified hospital infrastructure. Resumption of elective/emergent orthopedic care should be slow, phasic and strategic, much similar to unlocking. Cases must be stratified depending on covid status and severity. Dedicated O.Ts with neutral/negative pressure and HEPA filter for covid positive and suspected patients are to be used. All symptomatic and suspected patients should be investigated for covid-19 by RT-PCR, blood counts and CT scan. Regional anaesthesia should be preferred to General anaesthesia. Power drill/saw/burr/pulse lavage should be minimized to avoid aerosol generation. Postoperatively continuous surveillance and monitoring to be done for covid related symptoms. Medical institutes rapidly shifted to the online mode of education. Blended learning (virtual & physical) and imparting skills have to be continued in post covid phase with equitable distribution of teaching hours to students of different years.","Kumar, Saurabh; Shah, Bhushan; Johari, Ashok; Anjum, Rashid; Garg, Devansh; Salhotra, Rashmi; Tyagi, Asha; Khan, Amir Maroof; Jain, Anil Kumar",Indian J Orthop,,697
203512,Customers' social interactions and panic buying behavior: Insights from social media practices,2021,"Cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Manaus, Brazil, resurged in late 2020 despite previously high levels of infection. Genome sequencing of viruses sampled in Manaus between November 2020 and January 2021 revealed the emergence and circulation of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern. Lineage P.1 acquired 17 mutations, including a trio in the spike protein (K417T, E484K, and N501Y) associated with increased binding to the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor. Molecular clock analysis shows that P.1 emergence occurred around mid-November 2020 and was preceded by a period of faster molecular evolution. Using a two-category dynamical model that integrates genomic and mortality data, we estimate that P.1 may be 1.7- to 2.4-fold more transmissible and that previous (non-P.1) infection provides 54 to 79% of the protection against infection with P.1 that it provides against non-P.1 lineages. Enhanced global genomic surveillance of variants of concern, which may exhibit increased transmissibility and/or immune evasion, is critical to accelerate pandemic responsiveness.","Faria, Nuno R; Mellan, Thomas A; Whittaker, Charles; Claro, Ingra M; Candido, Darlan da S; Mishra, Swapnil; Crispim, Myuki A E; Sales, Flavia C S; Hawryluk, Iwona; McCrone, John T; Hulswit, Ruben J G; Franco, Lucas A M; Ramundo, Mariana S; de Jesus, Jaqueline G; Andrade, Pamela S; Coletti, Thais M; Ferreira, Giulia M; Silva, Camila A M; Manuli, Erika R; Pereira, Rafael H M; Peixoto, Pedro S; Kraemer, Moritz U G; Gaburo, Nelson; Camilo, Cecilia da C; Hoeltgebaum, Henrique; Souza, William M; Rocha, Esmenia C; de Souza, Leandro M; de Pinho, Mariana C; Araujo, Leonardo J T; Malta, Frederico S V; de Lima, Aline B; Silva, Joice do P; Zauli, Danielle A G; Ferreira, Alessandro C de S; Schnekenberg, Ricardo P; Laydon, Daniel J; Walker, Patrick G T; Schlüter, Hannah M; Dos Santos, Ana L P; Vidal, Maria S; Del Caro, Valentina S; Filho, Rosinaldo M F; Dos Santos, Helem M; Aguiar, Renato S; Proença-Modena, José L; Nelson, Bruce; Hay, James A; Monod, Mélodie; Miscouridou, Xenia",Science,,697

203705,The Never-ending Shift: A feminist reflection on living and organizing academic lives during the coronavirus pandemic,2020,"This is the second of two companion papers which examine emotional wellness of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) during the early years of life, defined here as the period between birth to age 12. Both papers promote optimal mental health and well-being, with an emphasis on early identification and intervention. The first paper explores child and family resilience. Here, we discuss strategies for pediatric CF teams to provide routine, systematic mental health assessment, anticipatory guidance, brief intervention, and triage to evidence-based treatment when needed, while addressing barriers to accessing care. Many mental health conditions emerge before the age of 12, with the potential for lifelong effects on individuals, their family, and society. Living with a chronic illness such as CF can further increase the risk of mental health concerns and, in a bidirectional manner, their consequences for quality of life, sustaining daily care, and health outcomes. There has been a significant focus in recent years on the mental health and wellness of adolescents and adults with CF, but less attention to specifics of depression and anxiety in younger children, or to other common pediatric comorbidities including trauma, developmental disorders such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and oppositional behavior. Given the availability of psychometrically sound screening instruments and effective interventions, routinely addressing the mental health of children with CF and their families is feasible to integrate within multidisciplinary CF care, allowing for a personalized approach respecting individual needs, values, and goals.

203975,“COVID-19 and students perception about MOOCs” a case of Indian higher educational institutions,2020,"Until less than two decades ago, all known human coronaviruses (CoV) caused diseases so mild that they did not stimulate further advanced CoV research. In 2002 and following years, the scenario changed dramatically with the advent of the new more pathogenic CoVs, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndome (SARS-CoV-1), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and the new zoonotic SARS-CoV-2, likely originated from bat species and responsible for the present coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which to date has caused 15,581,007 confirmed cases and 635,173 deaths in 208 countries, including Italy. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is mainly airborne via droplets generated by symptomatic patients, and possibly asymptomatic individuals during incubation of the disease, although for the latter, there are no certain data yet. However, research on asymptomatic viral infection is currently ongoing worldwide to elucidate the real prevalence and mortality of the disease. From a clinical point of view, COVID-19 would be defined as “COVID Planet “ because it presents as a multifaceted disease, due to the large number of organs and tissues infected by the virus. Overall, based on the available published data, 80.9% of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 develop a mild disease/infection, 13.8% severe pneumonia, 4.7% respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure, and 3% of these cases are fatal, but mortality parameter is highly variable in different countries. Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 causes severe primary interstitial viral pneumonia and a “cytokine storm syndrome”, characterized by a severe and fatal uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response triggered by the activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) with development of endothelitis and generalized thrombosis that can lead to organ failure and death. Risk factors include advanced age and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Virus entry occurs via binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present in almost all tissues and organs through the Spike (S) protein. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 infection is prevented by the use of masks, social distancing, and improved hand hygiene measures. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the main biological and clinical features of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, also focusing on the principal measures taken in some Italian regions to face the emergency and on the most important treatments used to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.","Contini, Carlo; Caselli, Elisabetta; Martini, Fernanda; Maritati, Martina; Torreggiani, Elena; Seraceni, Silva; Vesce, Fortunato; Perri, Paolo; Rizzo, Leonzio; Tognon, Mauro",Microorg.,,697

In this review, we situate COVID-19 in its context as a transboundary viral disease, and provide a comprehensive discussion focused on the discovery, spread, virology, pathogenesis, and clinical features of this disease, its causative coronaviral pathogen, and approaches to combating the disease through immunotherapies and other treatments and vaccine development. An epidemiological survey revealed a potentially large number of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers within the population, which may hamper efforts against COVID-19. Finally, we emphasize that vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, which may be developed by 2021, will be essential for prevention of COVID-19.","Ezzikouri, Sayeh; Nourlil, Jalal; Benjelloun, Soumaya; Kohara, Michinori; Tsukiyama-Kohara, Kyoko",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,697
206077,Coping with COVID-19: Higher Education in the GCC Countries,2021,"PURPOSE: The study was to examine county-level associations of physical activity with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths, per 100,000 county residents. METHODS: Data were collected from publicly available data sources for 3142 counties and equivalents, including the District of Columbia. Subjective health ratings, percentage uninsured, percentage unemployed, median household income, percentage female residents, percentage White residents, percentage of residents age 65 or older, and rural designation served as controls. RESULTS: The two-level random intercept regression showed that physical activity rates at the county level were statistically and negatively associated with COVID-19 cases and deaths. Additional analyses showed that physical activity rates moderated the relationship between cases and deaths, such that the relationship was strongest when physical activity rates were low. CONCLUSION: The results presented here offer empirical evidence of the benefits of county-level physical activity during a pandemic. Implications for public health and physical activity provision are discussed.","Cunningham, George B",,,697

METHODS: We apply a novel health services research approach to systematically assess a sample of 55 institutional websites. The accessibility, content, and coverage of occupational health/safety program information were systematically coded for several domains (e.g., OSHA-related, specific hazards, clinical, person-oriented, COVID-19, and coverage). RESULTS: Information was more available for programs related to OSHA mandates (e.g., chemical hygiene) and specific hazards than for person-oriented programs (e.g., counseling). Larger institutions provide better information and more comprehensive programs than smaller institutions. CONCLUSIONS: Higher education institutions warrant increasing attention to occupational health and safety, particularly as COVID-19 increased attention to workplace health issues.","Malomet, Maayan S; Harber, Philip",J. occup. environ. med,,697

Rapid adoption of telehealth has exposed limitations in the existing infrastructure. In this paper, we study and highlight photo quality as a major challenge in the telehealth workflow. We focus on teledermatology, where photo quality is particularly important; the framework proposed here can be generalized to other health domains. For telemedicine, dermatologists request that patients submit images of their lesions for assessment. However, these images are often of insufficient quality to make a clinical diagnosis since patients do not have experience taking clinical photos. A clinician has to manually triage poor quality images and request new images to be submitted, leading to wasted time for both the clinician and the patient. We propose an automated image assessment machine learning pipeline, TrueImage, to detect poor quality dermatology photos and to guide patients in taking better photos. Our experiments indicate that TrueImage can reject ~50% of the sub-par quality images, while retaining ~80% of good quality images patients send in, despite heterogeneity and limitations in the training data. These promising results suggest that our solution is feasible and can improve the quality of teledermatology care.","Vodrahalli, Kailas; Daneshjou, Roxana; Novoa, Roberto A; Chiou, Albert; Ko, Justin M; Zou, James",Pac Symp Biocomput,,697

They are closely related to the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs symmetries living on the null infinity in an isolated system. By studying the asymptotically flat spacetime in Brans-Dicke theory and the asymptotic symmetries, one discovers that the displacement memory effect in the tensor sector is due to the vacuum transition caused by the null energy fluxes panetrating the null infinity, while in the scalar sector, the vacuum transition is due to the angular momentum fluxes. Together with the spin and the center-of-mass memory effects, the displacement memories are constrained by various flux-balance laws.","Hou, Shaoqi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02087v1.pdf,697

211735,Leading with/in emotion states: The criticality of political subjects and policy debates in educational leadership on emotions,2020,"BACKGROUND: In January 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started to spread in Italy. The Italian government adopted urgent measures to slow its spread. Enforcing compliance with such measures is crucial in order to enhance their effectiveness. Engaging citizens in the COVID-19 preventive process is urgent today both in Italy and around the world. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the role of health engagement in predicting citizens' compliance with health emergency containment measures. METHOD: An online survey was administered between February 28 and March 4, 2020 on a representative sample of 1000 Italians. The questionnaire included a measure of health engagement (Patient Health Engagement Scale), a 5-item Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7, resulting in 4 positions that describe the psychological readiness to be active in one's own health management, and a series of ad hoc items intended to measure citizens' perceived susceptibility and severity of the disease, orientation towards health management, trust in institutional bodies, health habits and food consumption. To investigate the relationship between health engagement and these variables, ANOVA analysis, logistic regression and contingency tables with Pearson's chi-squared analysis have been carried out. RESULTS: Less engaged people show higher levels of perceived susceptibility to the virus and severity of the disease; they are less trustful of scientific and healthcare authorities, they feel less self-effective in managing their own health-both in normal conditions and under stress-and are less prone to cooperate with healthcare professionals. Low levels of health engagement also are associated with a change in the usual purchase behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The Patient Health Engagement model (PHE) provides a useful framework for understanding how people will respond to health threats such as pandemics. Therefore, intervention studies should focus on raising their levels of engagement to increase the effectiveness of educational initiatives intended to promote preventive behaviors.","Graffigna, Guendalina; Barello, Serena; Savarese, Mariarosaria; Palamenghi, Lorenzo; Castellini, Greta; Bonanomi, Andrea; Lozza, Edoardo",PLoS One,,697
211953,How Can E-Commerce Businesses Implement Discount Strategies through Social Media?,2020,"Objective: Determine the characteristics of postintensive care syndrome in the cognitive, physical, and psychiatric domains in coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors. Design: Single-center descriptive cohort study from April 21, to July 7, 2020. Setting: Critical care recovery clinic at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Patients: Adults who had critical illness due to coronavirus disease 2019 requiring an ICU stay of 7 days or more and who agreed to a telehealth follow-up in the critical care recovery clinic 1-month post hospital discharge. INTERVENTIONS: None. Measures and Main Results: Patient-reported outcome measures assessing physical and psychiatric domains were collected electronically, a cognitive test was performed by a clinician, and clinical data were obtained through electronic medical records. Outcome measures assessed postintensive care syndrome symptoms in the physical (Modified Rankin Scale, Dalhousie Clinical Frailty Scale, Neuro-Quality of Life Upper Extremity and Lower Extremity Function, Neuro-Quality of Life Fatigue), psychiatric (Insomnia Severity Scale; Patient Health Questionnaire-9; and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition), and cognitive (Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment) domains. The 3-Level Version of Euro-QoL-5D was used to assess the physical and psychiatric domains. A diagnosis of postintensive care syndrome was made in cases with evidence of impairment in at least one postintensive care syndrome domain. We included 45 patients with a mean (SD) age of 54 (13) years, and 73% were male. Ninety-one percent of coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors fit diagnostic criteria for postintensive care syndrome. 86.7 % had impairments in the physical domain, 22 (48%) reported impairments in the psychiatric domain, and four (8%) had impairments on cognitive screening. We found that 58% had some degree of mobility impairment. In the psychiatric domain, 38% exhibited at least mild depression, and 18 % moderate to severe depression. Eighteen percent presented Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, scores suggestive of posttraumatic stress syndrome diagnosis. In the Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 9% had impaired cognition. Conclusions: Survivors of critical illness related to coronavirus disease 2019 are at high risk of developing postintensive care syndrome. These findings highlight the importance of planning for appropriate post-ICU care to diagnose and treat this population.","Martillo, Miguel; Dangayach, Neha; Tabacof, Laura; Spielman, Lisa A; Dams-O039,; Connor, Kristen; Chan, Christy C; Kohli-Seth, Roopa; Cortes, Mar; Escalon, Miguel X",Crit. care med,,697

212519,Effects of COVID-19 in E-learning on higher education institution students: the group comparison between male and female,2020,"Bats are known reservoirs of Nipah virus (NiV) and some filoviruses and also appear likely to harbor the evolutionary progenitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). While bats are considered a reservoir of deadly viruses, little is known about people's knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of bat conservation and ecology. The current study aimed to assess community people's knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of bat ecology, myths, and the role of bats in transmitting NiV in Bangladesh. Since 2001, NiV has been a continuous threat to public health with a mortality rate of approximately 70% in Bangladesh. Over the years, many public health interventions have been implemented to raise awareness about bats and the spreading of NiV among the community peoples of Nipah outbreak areas (NOAs) and Nipah non-outbreak areas (NNOAs). We hypothesized that people from both areas might have similar knowledge of bat ecology and myths about bats but different knowledge regarding their role in the spreading of NiV. Using a four-point Likert scale-based questionnaire, our analysis showed that most people lack adequate knowledge regarding the role of bats in maintaining the ecological balance and instead trust their beliefs in different myths about bats. Factor score analysis showed that respondents' gender (p = 0.01), the outbreak status of the area (p = 0.03), and their occupation (p = 0.04) were significant factors influencing their knowledge of bat ecology and myths. A regression analysis showed that farmers had 0.34 times the odds of having correct or positive knowledge of bat ecology and myths than businesspersons (odds ratio (OR) = 0.34, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.15-0.78, p = 0.01). Regarding the spreading of NiV via bats, people had a lower level of knowledge. In NOAs, age (p = 0.00), occupation (p = 0.00), and level of education (p = 0.00) were found to be factors contributing to the amount of knowledge regarding the transmission of NiV, whereas in NNOAs, the contributing factors were occupation (p = 0.00) and level of education (p = 0.01). Regression analysis revealed that respondents who were engaged in services (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 1.07-8.54, p = 0.04) and who had completed primary education (OR = 3.06, 95% CI = 1.02-9.17, p < 0.05) were likely to have correct knowledge regarding the spreading of NiV. Based on the study results, we recommend educational interventions for targeted groups in the community, highlighting the ecosystem services and conservation of bats so as to improve people's current knowledge and subsequent behavior regarding the role of bats in ecology and the spreading of NiV in Bangladesh.","Hassan, Mohammad Mahmudul; Kalam, Md Abul; Alam, Mahabub; Shano, Shahanaj; Faruq, Abdullah Al; Hossain, Md Saddam; Islam, Md Nurul; Khan, Shahneaz Ali; Islam, Ariful",,,697
212666,Epidemics and macroeconomic outcomes: Social distancing intensity and duration,2021,"BACKGROUND: The pneumonia of COVID-19 illness has often a subtle initial presentation making mandatory the use of biomarkers for evaluation of severity and prediction of final patient disposition. We evaluated the use of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) for the outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 74 patients with COVID-19. Clinical data were collected, and survival predictors were calculated. Blood was collected within 24âh after admission (day 1) and on day 7. H2S was measured in sera by monobromobimane derivation followed by high-performance liquid chromatography and correlated to other markers like procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (CRP). Tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 were also measured in serum. RESULTS: Survivors had significantly higher H2S levels on days 1 and 7 after admission. A cut-off point of 150.44âµM could discriminate survivors from non-survivors with 80% sensitivity, 73.4% specificity, and negative predictive value 95.9%. Mortality after 28 days was 32% with admission levels lower than or equal to 150.44âµM and 4.1% with levels above 150.44âµM (P: 0.0008). Mortality was significantly greater among patients with a decrease of H2S levels from day 1 to day 7 greater than or equal to 36% (p: 0.0005). Serum H2S on day 1 was negatively correlated with IL-6 and CRP and positively correlated with the absolute lymphocyte count in peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that H2S is a potential marker for severity and final outcome of pneumonia by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Its correlation with IL-6 suggests anti-inflammatory properties.","Renieris, Georgios; Katrini, Konstantina; Damoulari, Christina; Akinosoglou, Karolina; Psarrakis, Christos; Kyriakopoulou, Magdalini; Dimopoulos, George; Lada, Malvina; Koufargyris, Panagiotis; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J",Shock,,697

While numerous randomized trials support the efficacy of telehealth to treat conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and insomnia, relatively little is known about patients' experiences and perceptions of telehealth in typical practice. Methods: We recruited a purposive sample of patients who had sleep provider encounters via one of three telehealth modalities: in-clinic video, home-based video, and telephone. We conducted semi-structured interviews to assess general telehealth experiences, elicit perceptions around most and least helpful aspects, and contrast their experiences with in-person care. Two analysts coded transcripts using content analysis. After review of coding and categorization, the analysts identified emergent themes that cut across participants and categories. Results: We conducted interviews with 35 patients (in-clinic video n=12, home-based video n=11, telephone n=12) at two VA medical centers from June 2019 to May 2020. Five themes emerged including access to care, security and privacy, personalization of care, patient empowerment, and unmet needs. 1) Access to care: Patients perceived that telehealth provided access to sleep care in a timely and convenient manner, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients also saw telehealth as a way to improve continuity of care with their preferred providers. 2) Security and Privacy: Patients described how home-based telehealth afforded them greater feelings of safety and security within appointments due to avoidance of anxiety provoking triggers (e.g. crowds). However, patients also noted a potential loss of privacy when telehealth was delivered at home. 3) Personalization of care: Patients outlined ways in which telehealth both improved and hindered their ability to communicate their individual needs to providers. In turn, this communication translated into the delivery of personalized care and positive health impacts. 4) Patient Empowerment: Patients described how telehealth empowered them to engage in self-management for their sleep disorders. 5) Unmet Needs: Patients recognized that there were specific areas where telehealth was not meeting their needs, including lack of follow-through with PAP therapy. Patients also expressed concerns around the lack of a physical examination. Conclusion: Patients described both positive and negative experiences with telehealth, highlighting areas where care can be further adapted to better suit their needs. As we continue to refine telehealth practices, we encourage providers and hospital systems to consider these aspects of the patient experience.","Donovan, L.

METHODS: Information on 1369 paediatric cases with COVID-19 from 8 December 2019 to 7 March 2020 in Hubei province was extracted from the National Infectious Disease Surveillance System. The analysis included epidemic curves, temporal-spatial distribution, clinical classification and interval times between onset and diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 1369 paediatric cases, the median age was 9 years and 58.2% of them were males. The proportion of severe and critical cases in children was lower than that in adults and the proportion of asymptomatic cases in children was five times greater than for adult cases. The first paediatric case was reported on 2 January 2020, and the daily number of new paediatric cases remained high from 1 February through to 22 February. The epidemiological curve of paediatric cases lagged behind that of adults by 19 days, and the first spike of the epidemic curve in senior high school students occurred 1 week earlier than in other paediatric groups. The proportion of clustered cases among children was about twice that for adults. The median of the interval in paediatric cases between onset and diagnosis, isolation and notification were 3, 0 and 3 days, respectively, and all of those were significantly shorter than in adults. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemic curve of child cases lagged behind that of adult cases by 19 days, and the major form of transmission observed was in clusters.","Wang, Mengyi; Nie, XiuQuan; Huang, Shuqiong; Pi, Wei; Wang, Dongming; Zhou, Min; Ma, Jixuan; Li, Mingyan; Chen, Weihong",J. paediatr. child health,,697

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, is the etiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a highly contagious intestinal disease affecting pigs of all ages. In this study, we optimized a viability real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the selective detection of infectious and heat-inactivated PEDV. PEMAX™, EMA™, and PMAxx™ photoactivable dyes along with PtCl 4and CDDP platinum compounds were screened as viability markers using two RT-qPCR assays: firstly, on PEDV purified RNA, and secondly on infectious and thermally inactivated virus suspensions. Furthermore, PMAxx™ pretreatment matched the thermal inactivation pattern obtained by cell culture better than other viability markers. Finally, we further optimized the pretreatment by coupling viability markers with Triton X-100 in inoculated serum resulting in a better estimation of PEDV infectivity than RT-qPCR alone. Our study has provided a rapid analytical tool based on viability RT-qPCR to infer PEDV infectivity with potential application for feed and feed ingredients monitoring in swine industry. This development would allow for greater accuracy in epidemiological surveys and outbreak investigations.","Puente, Héctor; Randazzo, Walter; Falcó, Irene; Carvajal, Ana; Sánchez, Gloria",Front.

220664,COVID-19: review of case reports,2020,"Background: To date, more than 105,805,951 cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed including 2,312,278 deaths. Many patients have cardiovascular risk-factors and/or co-morbidities and a lot of them developed de novo heart conditions during the active or the post-infectious phase of the infection. A number of studies tried to demonstrate an association between poor prognostic outcomes and cardiovascular comorbidities and related damages, but the quality of current evidence is still weak. Patients and methods: The aim of this single-center report is to describe the prevalence of cardiac injuries among our COVID-19 patients, to explore their association with survival outcomes and to demonstrate the medical care provided in our real-world setting. Our study included 610 COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of our university hospital of whom13.77% (nâ¯=â¯84) presented cardiovascular injuries and which we included in this case series. Results: The average age of our patients was 65 years (27-90). 60 were men (71.42%) while 24 were women (28.55%). Their average BMI was 29.7â¯kg/m2. Among them, 50 had a pulmonary embolism (59.52%), 12 patients had a myocardial infarction (14.28%), 10 presented pericarditis (11.9%) and 3 developed myocarditis (3.57%). There were 6 cases of ischemia (7.14%), 2 cases of stroke (2.38%), and 1 case of decompensated heart failure (1.19%). Among our patients, 46.42% had diabetes, 32.14% had a high blood pressure, 13.09% had a chronic renal failure and 14.28% had a history of ischemic heart disease. 14 patients (16.66%) had an elevated troponin with higher levels than 1000â¯ng/mL. The D-dimer value was high in almost all patients (80.95%). Lung damage from COVID-19 was extensive in 27.38%, severe in 32.14%, and critical in 40.47% of enrolled cases. CT chest angiography, ECG, and cardiac ultrasound were performed to the paraclinical confirmatory exploration of cardiac damages of these patients. Medical care was based on isolation, azithromycin, vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D, salicylic acid, dexamethasone followed with methylprednisolone, and anticoagulation for all hospitalized patients. Tocilizumab was indicated for 17 patients with hyperferritinemia (20.23% of patients). The initial respiratory care of our patients required oxygen therapy using nasal cannula (7.14%) high concentration masks (33.33%), high flow nasal cannula treatment (11.9%), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (5.95%), and mechanical ventilation (41.66%). Thrombolysis was performed in three subjects with myocardial infarction and 2 underwent angioplasty with placement of an active stent at the proximal interventricular anterior artery, which all were successful. Three massive pulmonary embolisms died despite adequate treatment. Colchicine and salicylic acid were administered for pericarditis cases. Thromboprophylaxis was indicated for all patients and was reinforced if a venous thrombotic episode was confirmed. Patients with limb ischemia underwent surgical treatment. Among the 84 patients included in our cohort, 34 (40.47%) died in intensive care unit and 50 (59.52%) had a favorable evolution. Conclusion: Cardiovascular involvement during COVID-19 should not be neglected and are associated with severe outcomes.","El Rhalete, Abdelilah; Rhazi, Inas; Bensaid, Amine; Zaid, Ikram; Bkiyer, Houssam; Ismaili, Nabila; Elouafi, Nouha; Housni, Brahim",Ann Med Surg (Lond),,697

Experimentally infected camelids clear infectious virus within one week and mount an effective adaptive immune response. Here, transcription of immune response genes was monitored in the respiratory tract of MERS-CoV infected alpacas. Concomitant to the peak of infection, occurring at 2 days post inoculation (dpi), type I and III interferons (IFNs) were maximally transcribed only in the nasal mucosa of alpacas, while interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) were induced along the whole respiratory tract. Simultaneous to mild focal infiltration of leukocytes in nasal mucosa and submucosa, upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 and dampened transcription of pro-inflammatory genes under NF-&#954;B control were observed. In the lung, early (1 dpi) transcription of chemokines (CCL2 and CCL3) correlated with a transient accumulation of mainly mononuclear leukocytes. A tight regulation of IFNs in lungs with expression of ISGs and controlled inflammatory responses, might contribute to virus clearance without causing tissue damage. Thus, the nasal mucosa, the main target of MERS-CoV in camelids, seems central in driving an efficient innate immune response based on triggering ISGs as well as the dual anti-inflammatory effects of type III IFNs and IL10.","Te, Nigeer; Rodon, Jordi; Ballester, Maria; Pérez, Mónica; Pailler-García, Lola; Segalés, Joaquim; Vergara-Alert, Júlia; Bensaid, Albert",PLoS Pathog,,697

We use antibody Fab/RBD structures to predict, and pseudotypes to confirm, that mutations found in late-stage evolved S variants confer resistance to a common class of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies we isolated from a healthy COVID-19 convalescent donor. Resistance extends to the polyclonal serum immunoglobulins of four out of four healthy convalescent donors we tested and to monoclonal antibodies in clinical use. We further show that affinity maturation is unimportant for wild-type virus neutralization but is critical to neutralization breadth. Because the mutations we studied foreshadowed emerging variants that are now circulating across the globe, our results have implications to the long-term efficacy of S-directed countermeasures.","Clark, Sarah A; Clark, Lars E; Pan, Junhua; Coscia, Adrian; McKay, Lindsay G A; Shankar, Sundaresh; Johnson, Rebecca I; Brusic, Vesna; Choudhary, Manish C; Regan, James; Li, Jonathan Z; Griffiths, Anthony; Abraham, Jonathan",Cell,,697

Os processos evolutivos de adaptação e influências ambientais podem ter induzido modificações sobre a lágrima dos vertebrados, e diferenças quali-quantitativas podem ocorrer, mesmo entre animais filogeneticamente próximos. A partir deste cenário, objetivou-se com esta pesquisa avaliar qualitativamente a lágrima dos tetrápodes (répteis, aves e mamíferos), com o emprego de metodologias inéditas para animais selvagens. O perfil proteico e a composição bioquímica da lágrima de répteis, aves e mamíferos, presentes em diferentes nichos ecológicos, foram avaliados comparativamente com o soro sanguíneo e a lágrima de humanos (fluidos que possuem parâmetros já estabelecidos), e foi obtido que a lágrima dos animais continham os mesmos compostos presentes na lágrima do humano e do soro sanguíneo, em diferentes proporções. Atribuiu-se que a proximidade filogenética, dieta e o ambiente, este último significativamente, influenciam sobre os componentes da lágrima. A partir destes resultados, algumas espécies foram selecionadas, por suas notórias diferenças no perfil eletroforético, para a investigação proteômica da lágrima, sendo elas o gaviões-carijó (Rupornis magnirostris), jacarés (Caiman latirostris) e tartarugas-marinhas (Caretta caretta). As proteínas encontradas, tal como suas características ontogênicas, demonstraram que a composição da lágrima pode ser derivada de condições ambientais e estilos de vida dos animais, mostrando-se apta a complexa adaptação das espécies. Ademais, foi realizada a descrição das glicoproteínas presentes na lágrima do gavião e jacaré, onde os resultados mostram maior frequência deste composto para aves, e que possivelmente as glicoproteínas possibilitam maior diversidade ao fluido lacrimal. Mesmo perante a processos metabólicos mais primitivos, percebe-se que são mantidos diferentes mecanismos de estabilização da lágrima. Desta forma, o fluído lacrimal perpassa o que é descrito para os mamíferos e trata-se de um fluido com alto poder de adaptação com a função de manter a homeostase da superfície ocular e consequente função visual.","RAPOSO, ANA CLAUDIA SANTOS",,,697

METHODS: All consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to Fuyang Second People's Hospital or the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital between 20 January and 22 February 2020 were enrolled and their clinical data were retrospectively collected. Multivariate Cox regression was used to identify risk factors associated with progression, which were then were incorporated into a nomogram to establish a novel prediction scoring model. ROC was used to assess the performance of the model. RESULTS: Overall, 208 patients were divided into a stable group (n = 168, 80.8%) and a progressive group (n = 40,19.2%) based on whether their conditions worsened during hospitalization. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that comorbidity, older age, lower lymphocyte count, and higher lactate dehydrogenase at presentation were independent high-risk factors for COVID-19 progression. Incorporating these 4 factors, the nomogram achieved good concordance indexes of .86 (95% confidence interval [CI], .81-.91) and well-fitted calibration curves. A novel scoring model, named as CALL, was established; its area under the ROC was .91 (95% CI, .86-.94). Using a cutoff of 6 points, the positive and negative predictive values were 50.7% (38.9-62.4%) and 98.5% (94.7-99.8%), respectively.

One of the interesting notions is that there is an association between COVID-19 and cancer. Cancer patients seem to exhibit exacerbated conditions and a higher mortality rate when exposed to the virus. Therefore, vaccines are the promising solution to minimise the problem amongst cancer patients threatened by the new viral strains. However, there are still limitations to be considered, including the efficacy of COVID vaccines for immunocompromised individuals, possible interactions between the vaccine and cancer, and personalised medicine. Not only to eradicate the pandemic, but also to make it more effective for immunocompromised patients who are suffering from cancer, a successful vaccine platform is required through the implementation of nanotechnology which can also enable scalable manufacturing and worldwide distribution along with its faster and precise delivery. In this review, we summarise the current understanding of COVID-19 with clinical perspectives, highlighting the association between COVID-19 and cancer, followed by a vaccine development for this association using nanotechnology. We suggest different administration methods for the COVID-19 vaccine formulation options.

In addition to the primary threat of infection, widespread secondary stressors associated with the pandemic have included social isolation, financial insecurity, resource scarcity, and occupational difficulties. OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the impact of these disruptions on psychological distress during the initial adjustment phase to the pandemic in North America. METHOD: A sample of 2463 residents of the US and Canada completed both baseline and follow-up surveys across several weeks between March and May 2020. RESULTS: Those participants perceiving stress related to higher levels of personal threat to health and to the well-being of family members at baseline reported higher levels of depressive symptoms at follow-up, even after controlling for baseline depressive symptoms. In addition, pandemic-related secondary stressors (social isolation, financial insecurity, occupational difficulty, and resource scarcity) were all independently associated with depressive symptoms at follow-up, controlling for both baseline depression and perceived health threats. The results were robust and held up after controlling for demographic factors. Women, young adults, and those who reported lower income were all at higher risk for subsequent depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: Findings from the present study can help to identify key groups at risk for mental health problems during the pandemic, and indicate actionable areas for targeted intervention.","Zheng, Jason; Morstead, Talia; Sin, Nancy; Klaiber, Patrick; Umberson, Debra; Kamble, Shanmukh; DeLongis, Anita",Soc Sci Med,,697

However, telehealth has not been widely implemented to monitor SARS-CoV-2 infection in quarantined individuals. Moreover, studies on the cost-effectiveness of quarantine measures during the COVID-19 pandemic are scarce. OBJECTIVE: In this cohort study, we aimed to use telehealth to monitor COVID-19 infections in 217 quarantined Taiwanese travelers and to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the quarantine program. METHODS: Travelers were quarantined for 14 days at the Taiwan Yangmingshan quarantine center and monitored until they were discharged. The travelers' clinical symptoms were evaluated twice daily. A multidisciplinary medical team used the telehealth system to provide timely assistance for ill travelers. The cost of the mandatory quarantine was calculated according to data from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Taiwan. RESULTS: All 217 quarantined travelers tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 upon admission to the quarantine center. During the quarantine, 28/217 travelers (12.9%) became ill and were evaluated via telehealth. Three travelers with fever were hospitalized after telehealth assessment, and subsequent tests for COVID-19 were negative for all three patients. The total cost incurred during the quarantine was US $193,938, which equated to US $894 per individual. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth is an effective instrument for monitoring COVID-19 infection in quarantined travelers and could help provide timely disease management for people who are ill. It is imperative to screen and quarantine international travelers for SARS-CoV-2 infection to reduce the nationwide spread of COVID-19.","Yen, Yung-Feng; Tsai, Yi-Fan; Su, Vincent Yi-Fong; Chan, Shang-Yih; Yu, Wen-Ruey; Ho, Hsuan; Hou, Chun-Mei; Chen, Chu-Chieh; Woung, Lin-Chung; Huang, Sheng-Jean",J Med Internet Res,,697

While molecular phylogenetic analyses have previously highlighted multiple introductions and a period of cryptic community transmission within New York City, little is known about the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 within and among its boroughs. We here perform phylogeographic investigations to gain insights into the circulation of viral lineages during the first months of the New York City outbreak. Our analyses describe the dispersal dynamics of viral lineages at the state and city levels, illustrating that peripheral samples likely correspond to distinct dispersal events originating from the main metropolitan city areas. In line with the high prevalence recorded in this area, our results highlight the relatively important role of the borough of Queens as a transmission hub associated with higher local circulation and dispersal of viral lineages toward the surrounding boroughs.","Dellicour, Simon; Hong, Samuel L; Vrancken, Bram; Chaillon, Antoine; Gill, Mandev S; Maurano, Matthew T; Ramaswami, Sitharam; Zappile, Paul; Marier, Christian; Harkins, Gordon W; Baele, Guy; Duerr, Ralf; Heguy, Adriana",PLoS Pathog,,697

It is well known that other vaccines including influenza and human papilloma virus (HPV) can result in reactive lymphadenopathy in the axilla and/or neck. Patients are now presenting via the two week wait neck lump clinic with supraclavicular fossa and low neck lymphadenopathy related to COVID vaccination, and to similar one stop breast clinics with axillary lymph nodes. In an audit of 80 patients seen over a period of one month, we found COVID vaccine-related low neck lymphadenopathy in four cases (5%), with an additional rectal cancer patient thought to have metastatic disease who presented with a Virchow type node. COVID vaccine-related lymphadenopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of low-neck nodes if they occurred shortly after vaccination, but it is important to exclude sinister disease using ultrasound and other investigations as necessary.","Mitchell, O R; Couzins, M; Dave, R; Bekker, J; Brennan, P A",Br. j. oral maxillofac. surg,,697
224705,"New urbanization and informal employment: Scale, pattern, and social integration",2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic has necessitated a range of population-based measures in order to stem the spread of infection. These measures may be associated with disruptions to other health services including for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) at risk for or living with HIV. Here, we assess the relationship between stringency of COVID-19 control measures and interruptions to HIV prevention and treatment services for MSM. SETTING: Data for this study were collected between 16-Apr-2020 and 24-May-2020 as part of a COVID-19 Disparities Survey implemented by the gay social networking app, Hornet. Pandemic control measures were quantified using the Oxford Government Response Tracker Stringency Index: each country received a score (0-100) based on the number and strictness of nine indicators related to restrictions, closures, and travel bans. METHODS: We used a multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear model with Poisson distribution to assess the association between stringency of pandemic control measures and access to HIV services. RESULTS: A total of 10,654 MSM across 20 countries were included. 38% (3992/10396) reported perceived interruptions to in-person testing, 55% (5178/9335) interruptions to HIV self-testing, 56% (5171/9173) interruptions to PrEP, and 10% (990/9542) interruptions to condom access. For every ten-point increase in stringency, there was a 3% reduction in the prevalence of perceived access to in-person testing (aPR: 0·97, 95%CI: [0·96, 0·98]), a 6% reduction in access to self-testing (aPR: 0·94, 95%CI: [0·93, 0·95]), and a 5% reduction in access to PrEP (aPR: 0·95, 95% CI: [0·95, 0·97]). Among those living with HIV, 20% (218/1105) were unable to access their provider; 65% (820/1254) reported being unable to refill their treatment prescription remotely. CONCLUSION: More stringent responses were associated with decreased perceived access to services. To minimize increases in HIV-related morbidity and mortality, innovative strategies are needed to minimize service interruptions to the community of gay men and other MSM during this and future waves of COVID-19.","Rao, Amrita; Rucinski, Katherine; Jarrett, Brooke; Ackerman, Benjamin; Wallach, Sara; Marcus, Julia; Adamson, Tyler; Garner, Alex; Santos, Glenn-Milo; Beyrer, Chris; Howell, Sean; Baral, Stefan",J. acquir. immune defic. syndr,,697

This paper summarizes the business drivers, challenges, guidance, and best practices for cloud adoption in power systems from the Task Force's perspective, after extensive review and deliberation by its members that include grid operators, utility companies, software vendors and cloud providers. The paper begins by enumerating various business drivers for cloud adoption in the power industry. It follows with the discussion of challenges and risks of migrating power grid utility workloads to cloud. Next for each corresponding challenge or risk, the paper provides appropriate guidance. Importantly, the guidance is directed toward power industry professionals who are considering cloud solutions and are yet hesitant about the practical execution. Finally, to tie all the sections together, the paper documents various real-world use cases of cloud technology in the power system domain, which both the power industry practitioners and software vendors can look forward to design and select their own future cloud solutions. We hope that the information in this paper will serve as useful guidance for the development of NERC guidelines and standards relevant to cloud adoption in the industry.","Zhang, Song; Pandey, Amritanshu; Luo, Xiaochuan; Powell, Maggy; Banerji, Ranjan; Fan, Lei; Parchure, Abhineet; Luzcando, Edgardo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.00303v3.pdf,697

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of patients with diabetes hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 11 March to 7 May 2020 at a large academic medical center in New York City. Multivariate modeling was used to assess the independent association of HbA1c levels and outpatient diabetes treatment regimen with mortality, in addition to independent effects of demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: We included 1,126 hospitalized patients with diabetes and COVID-19 for analysis, among whom mean age was 68 years, 50% were male, 75% were Black, mean BMI was 30 kg/m2, 98% had type 2 diabetes, mean HbA1c was 7.5%, and 33.1% died. HbA1c levels were not associated with mortality in unadjusted or adjusted analyses, but an outpatient regimen with any insulin treatment was strongly predictive. Additionally, age, sex, and BMI interacted such that in all age categories, mortality was higher with increasing BMI in males compared with females. CONCLUSIONS: In this large U.S. cohort of hospitalized patients with diabetes and COVID-19, insulin treatment, as a possible proxy for diabetes duration, and obesity rather than long-term glycemic control were predictive of mortality. Further investigation of underlying mechanisms of mortality and inpatient glycemic control is needed.","Agarwal, Shivani; Schechter, Clyde; Southern, Will; Crandall, Jill P; Tomer, Yaron",Diabetes Care,,697

Since this time a concerted global effort of research and observational data gathering has meant that a great deal has been learnt about the impact of COVID-19 in patients with lymphoid malignancies. Approximately one-third of patients with lymphoid malignancies who acquire COVID-19 and have it severely enough to require hospital assessment will die from this infection. Major risk factors for a poor outcome are age and co-morbidities, but when these are taken into account lymphoma patients have a slightly greater than 2-fold increased risk compared to the general population. Notably, despite early concerns regarding the particular vulnerability of lymphoma patients due to the immunosuppressive effects of therapy, active treatment, including B-cell depleting agents such as rituximab, do not appear to be associated with an increased risk of a poorer outcome. Indeed, some treatments such as ibrutinib may be beneficial due to their modulation of the potential fatal hyperinflammatory phase of infection. There are risks associated with hemopoietic stem cell transplantation, but the collective experience is that these can be minimized by preventive strategies and that the majority of transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection will survive. Many questions remain including those regarding the outcome of COVID-19 infection in the rarer lymphoid malignancies and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in lymphoma patients. This review aims to discuss these issues and present a summary of the current knowledge of the impact of COVID-19 in lymphoid malignancies.","Riches, J. C.",World Journal of Virology,,697

Infodemiology is now acknowledged by public health organizations and the WHO as an important emerging scientific field and critical area of practice during a pandemic. From the perspective of being the first ""infodemiolgist"" who originally coined the term almost two decades ago, I am positing four pillars of infodemic management: (1) information monitoring (infoveillance); (2) building eHealth Literacy and science literacy capacity; (3) encouraging knowledge refinement and quality improvement processes such as fact checking and peer-review; and (4) accurate and timely knowledge translation, minimizing distorting factors such as political or commercial influences. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the United Nations has advocated that facts and science should be promoted and that these constitute the antidote to the current infodemic. This is in stark contrast to the realities of infodemic mismanagement and misguided upstream filtering, where social media platforms such as Twitter have advertising policies that sideline science organizations and science publishers, treating peer-reviewed science as ""inappropriate content.""","Eysenbach, Gunther",J Med Internet Res,,697

The first step towards these goals is to correctly identify a patient that is infected with the virus. Our group applied an unsupervised machine learning technique to identify COVID-19 cases. This is an important topic as COVID-19 is a novel disease currently being studied in detail and our methodology has the potential to reveal important differences between it and other viral pneumonia. This could then, in turn, enable doctors to more confidently help each patient. Our experiments utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and the recently developed Robust Continuous Clustering algorithm (RCC). We display the performance of RCC in identifying COVID-19 patients and its ability to compete with other unsupervised algorithms, namely K-Means++ (KM++). Using a COVID-19 Radiography dataset, we found that RCC outperformed KM++; we used the Adjusted Mutual Information Score (AMI) in order to measure the effectiveness of both algorithms. The AMI for the two and three class cases of KM++ were 0.0250 and 0.054, respectively. In comparison, RCC scored 0.5044 in the two class case and 0.267 in the three class case, clearly showing RCC as the superior algorithm. This not only opens new possible applications of RCC, but it could potentially aid in the creation of a new tool for COVID-19 identification.","Householder, Jacob; Householder, Andrew; Gomez-Reed, John Paul; Park, Fredrick; Zhang, Shuai",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09899v1.pdf,697

Yet, production remains expensive as it is mostly done in mammalian expression systems. As most therapeutic IgG require mammalian glycosylation to interact with the human immune system, other expression systems are rarely used for production. However, for neutralizing antibodies that are not required to activate the human immune system as well as antibodies used in diagnostics, a cheaper production system would be advantageous. In our study, we show cost-efficient, easy and high yield production of antibodies as well as various secreted antigens including Interleukins and SARS-CoV-2 related proteins in a baculovirus-free insect cell expression system. To improve yields, we optimized the expression vector, media and feeding strategies. In addition, we showed the feasibility of lyophilization of the insect cell produced antibodies. Furthermore, stability and activity of the antibodies was compared to antibodies produced by Expi293F cells revealing a lower aggregation of antibodies originating from High Five cell production. Finally, the newly established High Five expression system was compared to the Expi293F mammalian expression system in regard of yield and costs. Most interestingly, all tested proteins were producible in our High Five cell expression system what was not the case in the Expi293F system, hinting that the High Five cell system is especially suited to produce difficult-to-express target proteins.","Korn, Janin; Schäckermann, Dorina; Kirmann, Toni; Bertoglio, Federico; Steinke, Stephan; Heisig, Janyn; Ruschig, Maximilian; Rojas, Gertrudis; Langreder, Nora; Wenzel, Esther Veronika; Roth, Kristian Daniel Ralph; Becker, Marlies; Meier, Doris; van den Heuvel, Joop; Hust, Michael; Dübel, Stefan; Schubert, Maren",Sci Rep,,697

The results show that the pooled prevalence of neonatal mortality, lower birth weight, stillbirth, premature birth, and intrauterine fetal distress in women with COVID-19 was 4% (95% Cl: 1 - 9%), 21% (95% Cl: 11 - 31%), 2% (95% Cl: 1 - 6%), 28% (95% Cl: 13 - 43%), and 14% (95% Cl: 4 - 25%); respectively. Moreover, the pooled prevalence of fever, cough, diarrhea, and dyspnea were 56% (95% Cl: 32 - 81%), 29% (95% Cl: 21 - 38%), 9% (95% Cl: 2 - 16%), and 3% (95% Cl: 1 - 6%) in pregnant women with COVID-19. Two studies reported that pregnant women with severe COVID pneumonia have higher levels of d-dimer. Also, COVID pneumonia is more common in pregnant women than non-pregnant. CONCLUSION: According to this meta-analysis, pregnant women with COVID-19 with or without pneumonia, are at a higher risk of preeclampsia, preterm birth, miscarriage and cesarean delivery. Furthermore, the risk of LBW and intrauterine fetal distress seems to be increased in neonates. In addition, our evaluations are investigative of higher risk of COVID-19 in the third trimester in pregnant women comparing to the first and second trimester. It can be due to higher BMI in the third trimester causing to increase the likelihood of disease deterioration, which can trigger a cascade of side effects starting with coagulation, pneumonia, hypoxemia affecting the placenta leading to ICU admission, fetal distress, premature birth and higher rates of C-section.","Soheili, Marzieh; Moradi, Ghobad; Baradaran, Hamid Reza; Soheili, Maryam; Mokhtari, Mohammad Mahdi; Moradi, Yousef",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,697
231761,Crisis management in higher education in the time of covid-19: The case of actor training,2021,"Lopinavir-ritonavir combination is being used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A low dose of ritonavir is added to other protease inhibitors to take advantage of potent inhibition of cytochrome (CYP) P450 3A4, thereby significantly increasing the plasma concentration of coadministered lopinavir. Ritonavir also inhibits CYP2D6 and induces CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2. This potent, time-dependent interference of major hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes by ritonavir leads to several clinically important drug-drug interactions. A number of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome and acute heart failure may have SARS-CoV-2 infection simultaneously. Lopinavir-ritonavir is added to their prescription of multiple cardiac medications leading to potential drug-drug interactions. Many cardiology, pulmonology, and intensivist physicians have never been exposed to clinical scenarios requiring co-prescription of cardiac and antiviral therapies. Therefore, it is essential to enumerate these drug-drug interactions, to avoid any serious drug toxicity, to consider alternate and safer drugs, and to ensure better patient care.","Agarwal, Shubham; Agarwal, Sanjeev Kumar",Cardiovasc. drugs ther,,697

Finding a new antibiotic is one way, whereas the repression of the dissemination of virulent pathogenic bacteria is another. From this point of view, this paper summarizes first the mechanisms of conjugation and transformation, two important processes of horizontal gene transfer, and then discusses the approaches for disarming virulent pathogenic bacteria, that is, virulence factor inhibitors. In contrast to antibiotics, anti-virulence drugs do not impose a high selective pressure on a bacterial population, and repress the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Disarmed virulence factors make virulent pathogens avirulent bacteria or pathobionts, so that we human will be able to coexist with these disarmed bacteria peacefully.","Ogawara, Hiroshi",J. antibiot,,697

METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 1,067 participants who were >18 years of age living in different provinces of Turkey recruited between August 15, 2020 and October 15, 2020. We used covariant structural analysis to assess the relationships of the constructs of the theoretical model. RESULTS: Significant fits were detected for Model 1 (&#967;2 = 924,389, p < .001, comparative fit index or CFI = 0.944), and for Model 2 (&#967;2 = 2,253,751, p < .001, CFI = 0.926). The predetermination and luck subdimensions reduce the fear of COVID-19, while the pessimism subdimension and compliance with preventive measures increase the fear. CONCLUSION: In public health crises such as COVID-19, it is important to plan scientific knowledge-based public education; take initiatives in accordance with the cultural, social, economic, religious, and local characteristics of the societies; and conduct public health studies covering the whole society.","Özdil, Kamuran; Bulucu Büyüksoy, Gizem D; Çatiker, Aslihan",Public health nurs,,697
233377,Strategic responses of the hotel sector to COVID-19: Toward a refined pandemic crisis management framework,2020,"Cold-exposure promotes energy expenditure by inducing brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis, which over time, is also sustained by browning, the appearance, or increase, of brown-like cells into white fat depots. Identification of circulating markers reflecting BAT activity and browning is crucial to study this phenomenon and its triggers, also holding possible implications for the therapy of obesity and metabolic diseases. Using RT-qPCR, we evaluated the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) expression profile of regulators of BAT activity (CIDEA, PRDM16), white adipocytes browning (HOXC9 and SLC27A1), and fatty acid ß-oxidation (CPT1A) in 150 Siberian healthy miners living at extremely cold temperatures compared to 29 healthy subjects living in thermoneutral conditions. Anthropometric parameters, glucose, and lipid profiles were also assessed. The cold-exposed group showed significantly lower weight, BMI, hip circumference, and PBMC expression of CIDEA, but higher expression of HOXC9 and higher circulating glucose compared to controls. Within the cold-exposed group, BMI, total cholesterol, and the atherogenic coefficient were lower in individuals exposed to low temperatures for a longer time. In conclusion, human PBMC expresses the brown adipocytes marker CIDEA and the browning marker HOXC9, which, varying according to cold-exposure, possibly reflect changes in BAT activation and white fat browning.","Efremova, Agrafena; Colleluori, Georgia; Thomsky, Mikhail; Perugini, Jessica; Protasoni, Marina; Reguzzoni, Marcella; Faragalli, Andrea; Carle, Flavia; Giordano, Antonio; Cinti, Saverio",Nutrients,,697

Dapagliflozin is licensed in the UK for use in the NHS while sotagliflozin may be available in future. These and possibly other SGLT inhibitors may be increasingly used in people with type 1 diabetes as new licences are obtained. These drugs have the potential to improve glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes with the added benefit of weight loss, better control of blood pressure and more time in optimal glucose range. However, SGLT inhibitors are associated with a higher incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis without significant hyperglycaemia. The present ABCD/Diabetes UK joint updated position statement is to guide people with type 1 diabetes and clinicians using these drugs help mitigate this risk and other potential complications. Particularly, caution needs to be exercised in people who are at risk of diabetic ketoacidosis due to low calorie diets, illnesses, injuries, starvation, excessive exercise, excessive alcohol consumption and reduced insulin administration among other precipitating factors for diabetic ketoacidosis.","Dashora, Umesh; Patel, Dipesh C; Gregory, Robert; Winocour, Peter; Dhatariya, Ketan; Rowles, Susannah; Macklin, Andrew; Rayman, Gerry; Nagi, Dinesh",Diabet Med,,697

We report our initial experience in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke with LVO in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: All consecutive patients with COVID-19 with acute ischemic stroke due to LVO treated in our institution during the 6 first weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak were included. Baseline clinical and radiological findings, treatment, and short-term outcomes are reported. RESULTS: We identified 10 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated for an acute ischemic stroke due to LVO. Eight were men, with a median age of 59.5 years. Seven had none or mild symptoms of COVID-19 at stroke onset. Median time from COVID-19 symptoms to stroke onset was 6 days. All patients had brain imaging within 3 hours from symptoms onset. Five patients had multi-territory LVO. Five received intravenous alteplase. All patients had mechanical thrombectomy. Nine patients achieved successful recanalization (mTICI2B-3), none experienced early neurological improvement, 4 had early cerebral reocclusion, and a total of 6 patients (60%) died in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Best medical care including early intravenous thrombolysis, and successful and prompt recanalization achieved with mechanical thrombectomy, resulted in poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Although our results require further confirmation, a different pharmacological approach (antiplatelet or other) should be investigated to take in account inflammatory and coagulation disorders associated with COVID-19.","Escalard, Simon; Maïer, Benjamin; Redjem, Hocine; Delvoye, François; Hébert, Solène; Smajda, Stanislas; Ciccio, Gabriele; Desilles, Jean-Philippe; Mazighi, Mikael; Blanc, Raphael; Piotin, Michel",Stroke,,697

This study aims to analyze predictors of beliefs in conspiracy theories. Because previous studies have emphasized only specific political, psychological, or structural factors or variables, this study constructs an integrated analytical model that includes all three factors. We analyze data from a large-scale survey of Koreans (N = 1525) and find several results. First, political, psychological, and structural factors influence beliefs in conspiracy theories. Second, when we examine the specific influences of the variables, we find that authoritarianism, support for minority parties, religiosity, trust in SNS (social networking services), perceived risk, anxiety, negative emotions, blame attribution, the quantity of information, health status, and health after COVID-19, all positively influence beliefs in conspiracy theories. Conversely, support for President Moon Jae-In's government, Christianity, trust in the government, perceived control, analytic thinking, knowledge, the quality of information, and gender, all negatively impact these beliefs. Among the predictors, the quality of information, health status, support for President Moon Jae-In's government, perceived risk, and anxiety have the most decisive impacts on beliefs in conspiracy theories.","Kim, Seoyong; Kim, Sunhee",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,697

Population-based evidence of the association between SDOH and practicing such mitigation strategies in adults with CVD is lacking. We used the National Opinion Research Center's COVID-19 Household Impact Survey conducted between April and June 2020 to evaluate sociodemographic disparities in adherence to COVID-19 risk mitigation measures in a sample of respondents with underlying CVD representing 18 geographic areas of the United States (US). Methods: CVD status was ascertained by self-reported history of receiving heart disease, heart attack, or stroke diagnosis. We built de novo, a cumulative index of SDOH burden using education, insurance, economic stability, 30-day food security, urbanicity, neighborhood quality, and integration. We described the practice of measures under the broad strategies of personal protection (mask, hand hygiene, physical distancing), social distancing (avoiding crowds, restaurants, social activities, and high-risk contact), and work flexibility (work-from-home, canceling/postponing work). We reported prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between SDOH burden (quartiles of cumulative indices) and practicing these measures adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidity, and interview wave. Results: 2036/25269 (7.0%) adults, representing 8.69 million in 18 geographic areas of the US, reported underlying CVD. Compared to the least SDOH burden, fewer individuals with the greatest SDOH burden practiced all personal protection (75.6% vs 89.0%) and social distancing measures (41.9% vs 58.9%) and had any flexible work schedule (26.2% vs 41.4%). These associations remained statistically significant after full adjustment: personal protection, (PR = 0.83; 95% CI [0.73-0.96]; P = 0.009); social distancing (PR = 0.69; 95% CI [0.51-0.94]; P = 0.018); and work flexibility (PR = 0.53; 95% CI [0.36-0.79]; P = 0.002). Conclusions: SDOH burden is associated with lower COVID-19 risk mitigation practices in the CVD population. Identifying and prioritizing individuals whose medical vulnerability is compounded by social adversity may optimize emerging preventive efforts, including vaccination guidelines.","Hagan, Kobina K; Javed, Zulqarnain; Cainzos-Achirica, Miguel; Sostman, H Dirk; Vahidy, Farhaan S; Valero-Elizondo, Javier; Acquah, Isaac; Yahya, Tamer; Kash, Bita; Andrieni, Julia D; Dubey, Prachi; Hyder, Adnan A; Nasir, Khurram","Circ., Cardiovasc. qual. outcomes (Online)",,697

This is causing a significant impact on life and physical health, as well as on the psychological well-being of the general population. Since the emotional distress and the social restrictions caused by this epidemic, it must be expected that its impact will also extend to sexual health. The purpose of this study, the first including a large sample of the Spanish general population, was to analyze sexual behavior during the 99 days of confinement in Spain (INSIDE Project). Method: One thousand four hundred forty-eight Spanish people, between 18 and 60 years old, were evaluated through an online survey during April 2020. The variables analyzed were the physical and social environment during confinement, sexual desire, type of sexual activity, masturbation, sexual intercourse, online sexual activity, general sexual frequency, sexual fantasies, degree of self-control over sexual drive, sexual abuse, general impact of confinement on sexuality, and emotional mood. Results: Confinement has affected the sexual life of half of the Spanish population (47.7%), especially women. Those who reported a worsening of their sexual life are almost three times more (37.9%) than those who reported an improvement (14.4%). Conclusions: Different factors have been significant predictors of the positive or negative evaluation about the impact of this confinement on sexual life, such as gender, couple life, privacy, stress level, and the perception of confinement as unbearable. Policy Implications: These results have important implications for the public health and more especially sexual health of the Spanish population.","Ballester-Arnal, Rafael; Nebot-Garcia, Juan E; Ruiz-Palomino, Estefanía; Giménez-García, Cristina; Gil-Llario, María Dolores",Sex Res Social Policy,,697
238282,Pandemic thoughts from a British junior doctor in Melbourne,2021,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) originating from China, has spread rapidly among people living in other countries. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), by the end of January, more than 104 million people have been affected by COVID-19, including more than 2 million deaths. The number of COVID-19 test kits available in hospitals is reduced due to the increase in regular cases. Therefore, an automatic detection system should be introduced as a fast, alternative diagnostic to prevent COVID-19 from spreading among humans. For this purpose, three different BiT models: DenseNet, InceptionV3, and Inception-ResNetV4 have been proposed in this analysis for the diagnosis of patients infected with coronavirus pneumonia using X-ray radiographs in the chest. These three models give and examine Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses and uncertainty matrices, using 5-fold cross-validation. We have performed the simulations which have visualized that the pre-trained DenseNet model has the best classification efficiency with 92% among two other models proposed (83.47% accuracy for inception V3 and 85.57% accuracy for Inception-ResNetV4).","Albahli, Saleh Ayub Nasir Shiraz Muhammad",Applied Soft Computing,,697

A study on the industry-specific volatility spillover networks of China's stock market during the outbreak of COVID-19,2020-07-15,"Guinea, like many other African countries, has been facing an unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak, since March 2020. In April 2020, Guinean National agency for health security recorded 1351 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 313 recoveries and 07 deaths. To address this health crisis, some drastic measures were implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Those measures might potentially cause some psychological problems among Guineans. Thus, we conducted this study to assess the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 in the Guinean population. We carried out an online cross-sectional survey among internet users in Guinea. A free e-survey platform was used, and questionnaires were sent to internet users. The study ran from May 1 through May 10 2020. Participation in the study was voluntary. Data collection was based on sociodemographic information and self-reported questionnaires: Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) for stress evaluation, Penn state worry questionnaire (PSWQ), and an adapted Social Psychological Measurements of COVID-19. A total of 280 participants took part in the study; responses from 5 participants were deleted because of incompleteness. The average age of participants was 28.9 [95% CI: 28.1;29.6]. Most of participants were male 65.5% [95% CI: 59.5%;71.1%]. Unemployed participants stood for 48.7% [95% CI: 42.7%;54.8%]. IES-R scale for stress evaluation yielded the following findings: 19.6% (mild), 5.23% (moderate) and 9.15% (severe); 82.8% and 17.2% of participants had respectively reported low and moderate worry. No significant statistical association was found between sociodemographic variables and traumatic events (IES-R and PSWQ). However, 82% of our participants had to cope with the negative impacts of COVID-19. Although there were few cases of traumatic events, negative impacts of COVID-19 on study participants deserve to be underlined. So, further investigations are necessary to identify and disentangle specific psychosocial problems in different Guinean socio-cultural contexts.","Touré, Almamy Amara; Camara, Lansana Mady; Magassouba, Aboubacar Sidiki; Doumbouya, Abdoulaye; Camara, Gnoume; Camara, Alsény Yarie; Loua, Gaspard; Cissé, Diao; Sylla, Mohamed; Bereté, Alpha Oumar; Beavogui, Abdoul Habib",PLoS One,,697

Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) may be one way to support this population. This is especially the case for caregivers in countries with limited resources, but high demand for psychological services. Objective: In this study we evaluated the effects of a therapist-guided 8-week-long ICBT intervention for informal caregivers. Methods: In total, 63 participants were recruited online and randomized either to the intervention or to the wait-list control group. The main study outcome was the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI). Secondary outcomes included measures of caregiver depression, anxiety, stress, and quality of life. Results: Moderate between-group effect sizes were observed for the CBI measure, in favor of the intervention group, with a Cohen d=–0.70 for the intention-to-treat analysis. Analyses of the subscales of the CBI showed significant reductions on the subscales of Development and Physical Health. Moderate reductions were found for depression and anxiety scores as indicated by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scores. Large between-group effects were observed for reduction in stress and increase in quality of life as indicated by the Perceived Stress Scale-14 (PSS-14), The Brunnsviken Brief Quality of Life Scale (BBQ), and The World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5). In addition, participants experienced little to no difficulty in using the program and were mostly satisfied with the intervention’s platform and the choice of content. Conclusions: This is the first internet intervention study for informal caregivers in Lithuania. The results suggest that therapist-guided ICBT can be effective in reducing caregiver burden, anxiety, depression, stress, and improving quality of life.

241913,The Role of Machine Learning Techniques to Tackle COVID-19 Crisis: A Systematic Review,2020,"Although the attention of the world and the global health community specifically is deservedly focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, other determinants of health continue to have large impacts and may also interact with COVID-19. Air pollution is one crucial example. Established evidence from other respiratory viruses and emerging evidence for COVID-19 specifically indicates that air pollution alters respiratory defense mechanisms leading to worsened infection severity. Air pollution also contributes to co-morbidities that are known to worsen outcomes amongst those infected with COVID-19, and air pollution may also enhance infection transmission due to its impact on more frequent coughing. Yet despite the massive disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are reasons for optimism: broad societal lockdowns have shown us a glimpse of what a future with strong air pollution measures could yield. Thus, the urgency to combat air pollution is not diminished, but instead heightened in the context of the pandemic.","Brauer, Michael; Casadei, Barbara; Harrington, Robert A; Kovacs, Richard; Sliwa, Karen",Glob Heart,,697

244426,"Implementation of Online Teaching in Medical Education: Lessons Learned from Students’ Perspectives during the Health Crisis in Marrakesh, Morocco",2021,"ABSTRACT: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented health crisis around the world, not least because of its heterogeneous clinical presentation and course. The new information on the pandemic emerging daily has made it challenging for healthcare workers (HCWs) to stay current with the latest knowledge, which could influence their attitudes and practices during patient care.This study is a follow-up evaluation of changes in HCWs' knowledge, attitudes, and practices as well as anxiety levels regarding COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. Data were collected through an anonymous, predesigned, self-administered questionnaire that was sent online to HCWs in Saudi Arabia.The questionnaire was sent to 1500 HCWs, with a 63.8% response rate (Nâ=â957). The majority of respondents were female (83%), and the most common age group was 31 to 40âyears (52.2%). Nurses constituted 86.3% of the respondents. HCWs reported higher anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic which increased from 4.91â±â2.84 to 8.6â±â2.27 on an 11-point Likert scale compared to other viral outbreaks. HCWs believed that their own preparedness as well as that of their hospital's intensive care unit or emergency room was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus pandemic (2012-2015). About 58% of HCWs attended one or more simulations concerning the management of COVID-19 patients in their intensive care unit/emergency room, and nearly all had undergone N95 mask fit testing. The mean score of HCWs' knowledge of COVID-19 was 9.89/12. For most respondents (94.6%), the perception of being at increased risk of infection was the main cause of anxiety related to COVID-19; the mean score of anxiety over COVID-19 increased from 4.91â±â2.84 before to 8.6â±â2.27 during the pandemic in Saudi Arabia.HCWs' anxiety levels regarding COVID-19 have increased since a pandemic was declared. It is vital that healthcare facilities provide more emotional and psychological support for all HCWs.","Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Al Huzaimi, Abdullah; Alrabiaah, Abdulkarim; Alamro, Nurah; Al-Sohime, Fahad; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman; Alhasan, Khalid; Kari, Jameela A; Alhaboob, Ali; Alsalmi, Amro; AlMuhanna, Wejdan; Almaghlouth, Ibrahim; Aljamaan, Fadi; Halwani, Rabih; Saddik, Basema; Barry, Mazin; Al-Zamil, Fahad; AlHadi, Ahmad N; Al-Subaie, Sarah; Jamal, Amr; Somily, Ali Mohammed",Medicine (Baltimore),,697

Treatment algorithms have been attempted as parallel to the increasing experience with Covid-19. In the pathogenesis of this virus proinflammatory cytokine storm has been called to have the main role. The right timing should be made for treatments. We proposed IL- 1 blocking by anakinra in seventeen Covid-19 patients at high risk of worsening. METHODS: Patients were assessed according to HScore, SOFA [Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score= SOFA], MuLBSTA Score (Multilobular infiltration, Hypo-Lymphocytosis, Bacterial coinfection, Smoking history, hyper-Tension, and Age), Brescia-COVID respiratory severity scale (BCRSS). RESULTS: In our study, mortality rate was 17.6%. Consequently, 1 (5.9%) patient was receiving low-flow oxygen supply, 3 (17.6%) patients needed no longer oxygen supply and 10 (58.8%) patients were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSION: According to results of our study in the manner of general evaluation; we found that SOFA, MuLBSTA and BCRSS scores were one step ahead according to HScore being insufficient to determine early phases of the disease. In our opinion, the prominent factors those emphasize the use of Anakinra could be listed as comorbidity, risk or presence of secondary infection, ongoing malignant disease. However, the other factors those enhance the use of Anakinra in the situation of viremia also could be sorted as no response to full dose antivirals, antiviral side effects or no success to antiviral treatment.

The study has been carried out in the Community of Madrid, which has the highest number of cases in Spain. The objective is to understand the incidence of COVID-19, the course of the disease if it occurs and the psychosocial and occupational impact on this population. METHODS: We included 345 patients (246 of haemophilia, 69 of von Willebrand Disease, two rare bleeding disorders and 28 carriers of haemophilia). A telephone survey was used to collect the data. RESULTS: Forty-two patients presented symptoms suggestive of infection by COVID-19, and in six cases, the disease was confirmed by RT-PCR. The cumulative incidence of our series was 1.73%. It is worth noting the complexity of the management of COVID-19 in two patients on prophylaxis with non-factor replacement therapy. Adherence to the prescribed treatment was maintained by 95.5% of patients. Although 94% were independent for daily living activities, 42.4% had a recognized disability and 58% required assistance, provided by the Madrid Haemophilia Association (Ashemadrid) in 75% of cases. Only 4.4% of consultations were held in person. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with congenital bleeding disorders infected with SARS-CoV-2 presented a mild course of the disease that did not require admission. Their identification and treatment by a specialist team from a Haemophilia Treatment Center are essential to make a correct assessment of the risk of haemorrhage/thrombosis. COVID-19 had a major impact on the psychosocial aspects of these patients which must be remedied with recovery plans.","Álvarez Román, María Teresa; Butta Coll, Nora; García Barcenilla, Sara; Pérez González, Lourdes; de la Plaza Collazo, Ivan; De la Corte Rodríguez, Hortensia; Romero Garrido, Jose A; Martín Salces, Monica; Rivas Pollmar, María Isabel; Cebanu, Tamara; González-Zorrilla, Elena; Acuña, Paula; Monzón Manzano, Elena; Rodríguez Merchán, Emérito Carlos; Trelles Martínez, Roberto; Blanco Bañares, María J; Gutiérrez Alvariño, Mar; Jiménez Yuste, Victor",Haemophilia,,697

246016,Learning cytology in times of pandemic: an educational institutional experience with remote teaching,2020,"Airborne viruses, such as influenza, tuberculosis, and SARS-CoV-2, are transmitted through virus-laden particles expelled when an infectious person sneezes, coughs, talks, or breathes. These virus-laden particles are more highly concentrated in the expiratory jet of an infectious person than in a well-mixed room, but this near-field enhancement in virion exposure has not been well quantified. Transmission of airborne viruses depends on factors that are inherently variable and, in many cases, poorly constrained, and quantifying this uncertainty requires large ensembles of model simulations that span the variability in input parameters. However, models that are well-suited to simulate the near-field evolution of respiratory particles are also computationally expensive, which limits the exploration of parametric uncertainty. In order to perform many simulations that span the wide variability in factors governing transmission, we developed the Quadrature-based model of Respiratory Aerosol and Droplets (QuaRAD). QuaRAD is an efficient framework for simulating the evolution of virus-laden particles after they are expelled from an infectious person, their deposition to the nasal cavity of a susceptible person, and the subsequent risk of initial infection. We simulated 10,000 scenarios to quantify the risk of initial infection by a particular virus, SARS-CoV-2. The predicted risk of infection was highly variable among scenarios and, in each scenario, was strongly enhanced near the infectious individual. In more than 50% of scenarios, the physical distancing needed to avoid near-field enhancements in airborne transmission was beyond the recommended safe distance of two meters (six feet) if the infectious person is not wearing a mask, though this distance defining the near-field extent was also highly variable among scenarios.","Fierce, Laura; Robey, Alison; Hamilton, Cathrine",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01219v1.pdf,697

Reanim. 24 (2020) 207­11]",2020,"Blood oxygen saturation (SpO$_2$) is an essential indicator of respiratory functionality and is receiving increasing attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical findings show that it is possible for COVID-19 patients to have significantly low SpO$_2$ before any obvious symptoms. The prevalence of cameras has motivated researchers to investigate methods for monitoring SpO$_2$ using videos. Most prior schemes involving smartphones are contact-based: They require a fingertip to cover the phone's camera and the nearby light source to capture re-emitted light from the illuminated tissue. In this paper, we propose the first convolutional neural network based noncontact SpO$_2$ estimation scheme using smartphone cameras. The scheme analyzes the videos of a participant's hand for physiological sensing, which is convenient and comfortable, and can protect their privacy and allow for keeping face masks on. We design our neural network architectures inspired by the optophysiological models for SpO$_2$ measurement and demonstrate the explainability by visualizing the weights for channel combination. Our proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art model that is designed for contact-based SpO$_2$ measurement, showing the potential of our proposed method to contribute to public health. We also analyze the impact of skin type and the side of a hand on SpO$_2$ estimation performance.","Mathew, Joshua; Tian, Xin; Wu, Min; Wong, Chau-Wai",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05087v1.pdf,697

There are multiple surgical and nonsurgical treatments available, with the surgical options having greater and longer-lasting effects. Such treatments have evolved over time with advances in technology and research, with numerous patients researching these treatments on Google. Many surgeons who provide these treatments belong to the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgeons (ISHRS). AIMS: To investigate trends in surgical hair restoration treatment from both the surgeon and patient perspectives. METHODS: Patient epidemiological and surgical data from the ISHRS were combined with search trend data from Google to analyze changing trends in surgical hair restoration treatment. RESULTS: Worldwide Internet searches for ""hair transplant"" have increased from 2004 to the present. Follicular unit excision (FUE) has supplanted follicular unit transplant (FUT) as the most popular hair transplant performed. Since 2004, there has been an increase in both nonsurgical and surgical female patients. Beard and eyebrow transplants have increased in popularity. Google searches follow this trend. Nonsurgical treatments such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) are being searched more frequently. Hair restoration clinics and Google searches were affected adversely by the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Technological advances in available therapies, improvement in delivery systems, changes in hair fashion, and global events have direct impact on hair restoration treatments offered by physicians and researched by patients. It is in the best interest of all hair restoration providers to keep abreast of changing technologies and treatment trends to stay at the forefront of their profession.","Gupta, Aditya K; Quinlan, Emma M",J Cosmet Dermatol,,697

Mitigation and suppression strategies have been implemented globally but the disease has proven to be difficult to contain. Initially many elective gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies were cancelled to reduce the risk of infection and conserve personal protective equipment (PPE), but many endoscopy units are now faced with the dilemma of resuming endoscopy service during the pandemic as indefinitely postponing diagnostic procedures may lead to a delay in the diagnosis and treatment of malignancies. Further concerns are surfacing as COVID-19 is now known to affect the GI tract and may potentially be spread via the fecal-oral route. Until more effective drugs and vaccines are available, it is unlikely that the pandemic will wind down in the near future. Maintaining a balance between protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients from being infected on the one hand and providing timely and effective clinical care on the other will become increasingly important as the pandemic persists. In this narrative review, the risk of COVID-19 infection for HCWs and patients undergoing endoscopy, and recommendations on maintaining safe, high-quality endoscopy practice will be discussed.","Lui, Rashid N",,,697

247547,Shifts in Digital Resources Usage for Gross Anatomy Education During Covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Human grading of digital images from diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening programmes represents a significant challenge, due to the increasing prevalence of diabetes. We evaluate the performance of an automated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to triage retinal images from the English Diabetic Eye Screening Programme (DESP) into test-positive/technical failure versus test-negative, using human grading following a standard national protocol as the reference standard. METHODS: Retinal images from 30 405 consecutive screening episodes from three English DESPs were manually graded following a standard national protocol and by an automated process with machine learning enabled software, EyeArt v2.1. Screening performance (sensitivity, specificity) and diagnostic accuracy (95% CIs) were determined using human grades as the reference standard. RESULTS: Sensitivity (95% CIs) of EyeArt was 95.7% (94.8% to 96.5%) for referable retinopathy (human graded ungradable, referable maculopathy, moderate-to-severe non-proliferative or proliferative). This comprises sensitivities of 98.3% (97.3% to 98.9%) for mild-to-moderate non-proliferative retinopathy with referable maculopathy, 100% (98.7%,100%) for moderate-to-severe non-proliferative retinopathy and 100% (97.9%,100%) for proliferative disease. EyeArt agreed with the human grade of no retinopathy (specificity) in 68% (67% to 69%), with a specificity of 54.0% (53.4% to 54.5%) when combined with non-referable retinopathy. CONCLUSION: The algorithm demonstrated safe levels of sensitivity for high-risk retinopathy in a real-world screening service, with specificity that could halve the workload for human graders. AI machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as this can provide clinically equivalent, rapid detection of retinopathy, particularly in settings where a trained workforce is unavailable or where large-scale and rapid results are needed.","Heydon, Peter; Egan, Catherine; Bolter, Louis; Chambers, Ryan; Anderson, John; Aldington, Steve; Stratton, Irene M; Scanlon, Peter Henry; Webster, Laura; Mann, Samantha; du Chemin, Alain; Owen, Christopher G; Tufail, Adnan; Rudnicka, Alicja Regina",Br. j. ophthalmol,,697

The most reliable hypothetical pathogenetic mechanism for CV complications and cardiac injury in severe COVID-19 patients appears to be a sustained endothelial dysfunction, caused by the interplay of inflammation and coagulation. In this review, we survey papers addressing issues related to severe COVID-19, characterized by enhanced lung microvascular loss, hypercytokinemia, hypoxemia and thrombosis. We discuss about how the virus-induced downregulation of the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, used to enter the host cell, could affect the renin-angiotensin system, attempting to clarify the doubts about the use of ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin-II receptor blockers in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we point out how the delicate and physiological homeostatic function of the endothelium, which turns into a disastrous battlefield of the complex interaction between ""cytokine and coagulative storms"", can be irreparably compromised and result in systemic inflammatory complications.","Del Turco, Serena; Vianello, Annamaria; Ragusa, Rosetta; Caselli, Chiara; Basta, Giuseppina",Thromb Res,,697

248978,Measuring Global Multi-Scale Place Connectivity using Geotagged Social Media Data,2021-02-08,"Personalized assessment and treatment of severe patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have greatly affected the prognosis and survival of these patients. This study aimed to develop the radiomics models as the potential biomarkers to estimate the overall survival (OS) for the COVID-19 severe patients. A total of 74 COVID-19 severe patients were enrolled in this study, and 30 of them died during the follow-up period. First, the clinical risk factors of the patients were analyzed. Then, two radiomics signatures were constructed based on two segmented volumes of interest of whole lung area and lesion area. Two combination models were built depend on whether the clinic risk factors were used and/or whether two radiomics signatures were combined. Kaplan-Meier analysis were performed for validating two radiomics signatures and C-index was used to evaluated the predictive performance of all radiomics signatures and combination models. Finally, a radiomics nomogram combining radiomics signatures with clinical risk factors was developed for predicting personalized OS, and then assessed with respect to the calibration curve. Three clinical risk factors were found, included age, malignancy and highest temperature that influence OS. Both two radiomics signatures could effectively stratify the risk of OS in COVID-19 severe patients. The predictive performance of the combination model with two radiomics signatures was better than that only one radiomics signature was used, and became better when three clinical risk factors were interpolated. Calibration curves showed good agreement in both 15 d survival and 30 d survival between the estimation with the constructed nomogram and actual observation. Both two constructed radiomics signatures can act as the potential biomarkers for risk stratification of OS in COVID-19 severe patients. The radiomics+clinical nomogram generated might serve as a potential tool to guide personalized treatment and care for these patients.","Xiao, Feng; Sun, Rongqing; Sun, Wenbo; Xu, Dan; Lan, Lan; Li, Huan; Liu, Huan; Xu, Haibo",Phys. med. biol,,697

250331,Critical Family History and Cultural Evolution: A Call for Interdisciplinary Research to Determine What Works to Replace Anger with Compassion for Social Justice,2020,"PURPOSE: Community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in Spain in February 2020, with 216% intensive care unit (ICU) capacity expanded in Vitoria by March 18th, 2020. METHODS: We identified patients from the two public hospitals in Vitoria who were admitted to ICU with confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2. Data reported here were available in April 6th, 2020. Mortality was assessed in those who completed 15-days of ICU stay. RESULTS: We identified 48 patients (27 males) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] age of patients was 63 [51-75] years. Symptoms began a median of 7 [5-12] days before ICU admission. The most common comorbidities identified were obesity (48%), arterial hypertension (44%) and chronic lung disease (37%). All patients were admitted by hypoxemic respiratory failure and none received non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Forty-five (94%) underwent intubation, 3 (6%) high flow nasal therapy (HFNT), 1 (2%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and 22 (46%) required prone position. After 15 days, 14/45 (31%) intubated patients died (13% within one week), 10/45 (22%) were extubated, and 21/45 (47%) underwent mechanical ventilation. Six patients had documented super-infection. Procalcitonin plasma above 0.5µg/L was associated with 16% vs. 19% (p=0.78) risk of death after 7 days. CONCLUSION: This early experience with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain suggests that a strategy of right oxygenation avoiding non-invasive mechanical ventilation was life-saving. Seven-day mortality in SARS-CoV-2 requiring intubation was lower than 15%, with 80% of patients still requiring mechanical ventilation. After 15 days of ICU admission, half of patients remained intubated, whereas one third died.","Barrasa, Helena; Rello, Jordi; Tejada, Sofia; Martín, Alejandro; Balziskueta, Goiatz; Vinuesa, Cristina; Fernández-Miret, Borja; Villagra, Ana; Vallejo, Ana; San Sebastián, Ana; Cabañes, Sara; Iribarren, Sebastián; Fonseca, Fernando; Maynar, Javier",Anaesth Crit Care Pain Med,,697
250435,Oscillatory dynamics in the dilemma of social distancing,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity is a major concern in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and economic reopening. However, rigorous determination of SARS-COV-2 infectivity is essentially impossible owing to its continuous evolution with over 13752 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) variants in six different subtypes. We develop an advanced machine learning algorithm based on the algebraic topology to quantitatively evaluate the binding affinity changes of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor following the mutations. Based on mutation-induced binding affinity changes, we reveal that five out of six SARS-CoV-2 subtypes have become either moderately or slightly more infectious, while one subtype has weakened its infectivity. We find that SARS-CoV-2 is slightly more infectious than SARS-CoV according to computed S protein-ACE2 binding affinity changes. Based on a systematic evaluation of all possible 3686 future mutations on the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), we show that most likely future mutations will make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious. Combining sequence alignment, probability analysis, and binding affinity calculation, we predict that a few residues on the receptor-binding motif (RBM), i.e., 452, 489, 500, 501, and 505, have very high chances to mutate into significantly more infectious COVID-19 strains.","Chen, Jiahui; Wang, Rui; Wang, Menglun; Wei, Guo-Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14669v1.pdf,697

We aim at comparing the performance of antigenic detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples via an immunochromatographic method to molecular detection via qRT-PCR. Materials and Methods47 nasopharyngeal exudates were collected from suspicious COVID-19 cases. The samples were performed both via the qualitative immuno-chromatographic method for S protein detection in the SARS-CoV-2 structure, using fluorescent labelled anti-protein S antibodies and via qRT-PCR test for the qualitative detection of the screening gene E and the specific ORF1ab region of the RNA-SARS-CoV-2. ResultsThere was a fair correlation between the positive antigen tests and the positive PCR assays measured through threshold cycle ORF1ab region (Ct orf). A better correlation was obtained between the antigen test results and the Ct orf when including patients with Ct orf below 25. ConclusionsUsing antigen tests as screening tests is useful on symptomatic persons during the viral replication period, therefore during the contagious period. A positive test shows a high predictive value for infection, while a negative antigen test result via immuno-chromatography must be confirmed by a qRT-PCR test.","Lunca, Catalina; Cojocaru, Cristian; Gurzu, Irina Luciana; Petrariu, Florin Dumitru; Cojocaru, Elena",,,697

254803,Critical review of the Threats affecting the building of Critical Infrastructure Resilience,2021,"Since the onslaught of SARS-CoV-2, the research community has been searching for a vaccine to fight against this virus. However, during this period, the virus has mutated to adapt to the different environmental conditions in the world and made the task of vaccine design more challenging. In this situation, the identification of virus strains is very much timely and important task. We have performed genome-wide analysis of 10664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries to identify and prepare a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) dataset of SARS-CoV-2. Thereafter, with the use of this SNP data, the advantage of hierarchical clustering is taken care of in such a way so that Average Linkage and Complete Linkage with Jaccard and Hamming distance functions are applied separately in order to identify the virus strains as clusters present in the SNP data. In this regard, the consensus of both the clustering results are also considered while Silhouette index is used as a cluster validity index to measure the goodness of the clusters as well to determine the number of clusters or virus strains. As a result, we have identified five major clusters or virus strains present worldwide. Apart from quantitative measures, these clusters are also visualized using Visual Assessment of Tendency (VAT) plot. The evolution of these clusters are also shown. Furthermore, top 10 signature SNPs are identified in each cluster and the non-synonymous signature SNPs are visualised in the respective protein structures. Also, the sequence and structural homology-based prediction along with the protein structural stability of these non-synonymous signature SNPs are reported in order to judge the characteristics of the identified clusters. As a consequence, T85I, Q57H and R203M in NSP2, ORF3a and Nucleocapsid respectively are found to be responsible for Cluster 1 as they are damaging and unstable non-synonymous signature SNPs. Similarly, F506L and S507C in Exon are responsible for both Clusters 3 and 4 while Clusters 2 and 5 do not exhibit such behaviour due to the absence of any non-synonymous signature SNPs. In addition to all these, the code, SNP dataset, 10664 labelled SARS-CoV-2 strains and additional results as supplementary are provided through our website for further use.","Ghosh, Nimisha; Saha, Indrajit; Sharma, Nikhil; Nandi, Suman; Plewczynski, Dariusz",Virus Res,,697

255318,Cardiovascular Effects of COVID-19 - What Do We Know and Where Should We Go?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The degree to which infection with SARS-CoV-2 confers protection towards subsequent reinfection is not well described. In 2020, as part of Denmark's extensive, free-of-charge PCR-testing strategy, approximately 4 million individuals (69% of the population) underwent 10·6 million tests. Using these national PCR-test data from 2020, we estimated protection towards repeat infection with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this population-level observational study, we collected individual-level data on patients who had been tested in Denmark in 2020 from the Danish Microbiology Database and analysed infection rates during the second surge of the COVID-19 epidemic, from Sept 1 to Dec 31, 2020, by comparison of infection rates between individuals with positive and negative PCR tests during the first surge (March to May, 2020). For the main analysis, we excluded people who tested positive for the first time between the two surges and those who died before the second surge. We did an alternative cohort analysis, in which we compared infection rates throughout the year between those with and without a previous confirmed infection at least 3 months earlier, irrespective of date. We also investigated whether differences were found by age group, sex, and time since infection in the alternative cohort analysis. We calculated rate ratios (RRs) adjusted for potential confounders and estimated protection against repeat infection as 1 - RR. FINDINGS: During the first surge (ie, before June, 2020), 533 381 people were tested, of whom 11 727 (2·20%) were PCR positive, and 525 339 were eligible for follow-up in the second surge, of whom 11 068 (2·11%) had tested positive during the first surge. Among eligible PCR-positive individuals from the first surge of the epidemic, 72 (0·65% [95% CI 0·51-0·82]) tested positive again during the second surge compared with 16 819 (3·27% [3·22-3·32]) of 514 271 who tested negative during the first surge (adjusted RR 0·195 [95% CI 0·155-0·246]). Protection against repeat infection was 80·5% (95% CI 75·4-84·5). The alternative cohort analysis gave similar estimates (adjusted RR 0·212 [0·179-0·251], estimated protection 78·8% [74·9-82·1]). In the alternative cohort analysis, among those aged 65 years and older, observed protection against repeat infection was 47·1% (95% CI 24·7-62·8). We found no difference in estimated protection against repeat infection by sex (male 78·4% [72·1-83·2] vs female 79·1% [73·9-83·3]) or evidence of waning protection over time (3-6 months of follow-up 79·3% [74·4-83·3] vs &#8805;7 months of follow-up 77·7% [70·9-82·9]). INTERPRETATION: Our findings could inform decisions on which groups should be vaccinated and advocate for vaccination of previously infected individuals because natural protection, especially among older people, cannot be relied on.

As a new biotechnology, suprachoroidal injections of biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) containing a reporter plasmid induce reporter expression in rat photoreceptors and RPE throughout the entire eye and maintain expression for at least 8 months. Multiple injections markedly increase expression. Suprachoroidal injection of NPs containing a VEGF expression plasmid caused severe subretinal neovascularization progressing to subretinal fibrosis, similar to what occurs in untreated patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, providing a new model and proof of concept for level and duration of expression. Suprachoroidal injection of NPs containing a VEGF-binding protein expression plasmid significantly suppressed VEGF-induced vascular leakage and neovascularization demonstrating therapeutic potential. These data suggest that nonviral NP suprachoroidal gene transfer may provide a noninvasive, repeatable alternative to subretinal injection of viral vectors.","Shen, Jikui; Kim, Jayoung; Tzeng, Stephany Y; Ding, Kun; Hafiz, Zibran; Long, Da; Wang, Jiangxia; Green, Jordan J; Campochiaro, Peter A",Sci.

258644,Collecting and evaluating convalescent plasma for COVID-19 treatment: why and how?,2020,"Upland soil clusters alpha and gamma (USC&#945; and USCÎ³) are considered a major biological sink of atmospheric methane and are often detected in forest and grassland soils. These clusters are phylogenetically classified using the particulate methane monooxygenase gene pmoA because of the difficulty of cultivation. Recent studies have established a direct link of pmoA genes to 16S rRNA genes based on their isolated strain or draft genomes. However, whether the results of pmoA-based assays could be largely represented by 16S rRNA gene sequencing in upland soils remains unclear. In this study, we collected 20 forest soils across China and compared methane-oxidizing bacterial (MOB) communities by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and pmoA genes using different primer sets. The results showed that 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the pmoA gene (A189/A682r nested with a mixture of mb661 and A650) consistently revealed the dominance of USC&#945; (accounting for more than 50% of the total MOB) in 12 forest soils. A189f/A682r successfully amplified pmoA genes (mainly RA14 of USC&#945;) in only three forest soils. A189f/mb661 could amplify USC&#945; (mainly JR1) in several forest soils but showed a strong preferential amplification of Methylocystis and many other type I MOB groups. A189f/A650 almost exclusively amplified USC&#945; (mainly JR1) and largely discriminated against Methylocystis and most of the other MOB groups. The semi-nested PCR approach weakened the bias of A189f/mb661 and A189f/A650 for JR1 and balanced the coverage of all USC&#945; members. The canonical correspondence analysis indicated that soil NH4+-N and pH were the main environmental factors affecting the MOB community of Chinese forest soils. The RA14 of the USC&#945; group prefers to live in soils with low pH, low temperature, low elevation, high precipitation, and rich in nitrogen. JR1's preferences for temperature and elevation were opposite to RA14. Our study suggests that combining the deep sequencing of 16S rRNA and pmoA genes to characterize MOB in forest soils is the best choice.","Cai, Yuanfeng; Zhou, Xue; Shi, Limei; Jia, Zhongjun",,,697

258849,Social Distancing: The Sensitivity of Numerical Simulations,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has re-focused attention on mechanisms that lead to zoonotic disease spillover and spread. Commercial wildlife trade, and associated markets, are recognized mechanisms for zoonotic disease emergence, resulting in a growing global conversation around reducing human disease risks from spillover associated with hunting, trade, and consumption of wild animals. These discussions are especially relevant to people who rely on harvesting wildlife to meet nutritional, and cultural needs, including those in Arctic and boreal regions. Global policies around wildlife use and trade can impact food sovereignty and security, especially of Indigenous Peoples. We reviewed known zoonotic pathogens and current risks of transmission from wildlife (including fish) to humans in North American Arctic and boreal biomes, and evaluated the epidemic and pandemic potential of these zoonoses. We discuss future concerns, and consider monitoring and mitigation measures in these changing socio-ecological systems. While multiple zoonotic pathogens circulate in these systems, risks to humans are mostly limited to individual illness or local community outbreaks. These regions are relatively remote, subject to very cold temperatures, have relatively low wildlife, domestic animal, and pathogen diversity, and in many cases low density, including of humans. Hence, favorable conditions for emergence of novel diseases or major amplification of a spillover event are currently not present. The greatest risk to northern communities from pathogens of pandemic potential is via introduction with humans visiting from other areas. However, Arctic and boreal ecosystems are undergoing rapid changes through climate warming, habitat encroachment, and development; all of which can change host and pathogen relationships, thereby affecting the probability of the emergence of new (and re-emergence of old) zoonoses. Indigenous leadership and engagement in disease monitoring, prevention and response, is vital from the outset, and would increase the success of such efforts, as well as ensure the protection of Indigenous rights as outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Partnering with northern communities and including Indigenous Knowledge Systems would improve the timeliness, and likelihood, of detecting emerging zoonotic risks, and contextualize risk assessments to the unique human-wildlife relationships present in northern biomes.","Keatts, Lucy O; Robards, Martin; Olson, Sarah H; Hueffer, Karsten; Insley, Stephen J; Joly, Damien O; Kutz, Susan; Lee, David S; Chetkiewicz, Cheryl-Lesley B; Lair, Stéphane; Preston, Nicholas D; Pruvot, Mathieu; Ray, Justina C; Reid, Donald; Sleeman, Jonathan M; Stimmelmayr, Raphaela; Stephen, Craig; Walzer, Chris",Front Public Health,,697

260777,The impact of the COVID public policies on the Chilean households,2020,"Ultrasonic compression was applied to wheat flour to create an agglomerated and compacted model food system. This novel process combines physical compression with ultrasonic vibration to permanently weld particles together, thereby producing a robust compact. Fundamental relationships among operating parameters, energy imparted to the specimens, and physical properties of the agglomerated products were developed. Integrated agglomeration energy was determined to be a linear function of percent maximum horn amplitude and ultrasonication time, and integrated energy in turn influenced product physical properties, such as density and fracture strength, in highly significant linear relationships. Microscopic, computer tomographic, and differential scanning calorimetric analyses confirmed progressive compaction of and thermal stability changes in the flour matrix with increased processing energy. Specimens agglomerated at higher energy levels were furthermore demonstrated to have higher fracture strength than conventionally (pressure-only) compressed specimens despite similar densities, due to the robust interparticle bridging produced by agglomeration. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Ultrasonic agglomeration represents a potential improvement over standard compression in the manufacturing of meal-supplementing energy bars. Ultrasonic agglomeration effectively adheres particles together without incorporation of low-nutrient- density syrups and binders. Agglomerated and compacted products also have superior mechanical stability, which can improve texture and physical stability during product handling.","Barrett, Ann; Ahnrud, Gianna; Ziegler, David; Liu, Xun; Kaletunc, Gonul",J. food sci,,697

P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a mucin-like glycoprotein, has recently been found to restrict HIV-1 infectivity through virion incorporation that sterically hinders virus particle attachment to target cells. Here, we report the identification of a family of antiviral cellular proteins, named the Surface-Hinged, Rigidly-Extended Killer (SHREK) family of virion inactivators (PSGL-1, CD43, TIM-1, CD34, PODXL1, PODXL2, CD164, MUC1, MUC4, and TMEM123) that share similar structural characteristics with PSGL-1. We demonstrate that SHREK proteins block HIV-1 infectivity by inhibiting virus particle attachment to target cells. In addition, we demonstrate that SHREK proteins are broad-spectrum host antiviral factors that block the infection of diverse viruses such as influenza A. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a subset of SHREKs also blocks the infectivity of a hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2 (Ha-CoV-2) pseudovirus. These results suggest that SHREK proteins may be a part of host innate immunity against enveloped viruses.","Dabbagh, Deemah; He, Sijia; Hetrick, Brian; Chilin, Linda; Andalibi, Ali; Wu, Yuntao",Viruses,,697
261646,More than a scratch: emergency setting eye evaluation during COVID-19 lockdown,2021,"Hydroxychloroquine, used to treat malaria and some autoimmune disorders, potently inhibits viral infection of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2 in cell-culture studies. However, human clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine failed to establish its usefulness as treatment for COVID-19. This compound is known to interfere with endosomal acidification necessary to the proteolytic activity of cathepsins. Following receptor binding and endocytosis, cathepsin L can cleave the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins, thereby activating membrane fusion for cell entry. The plasma membrane-associated protease TMPRSS2 can similarly cleave these S proteins and activate viral entry at the cell surface. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 entry process is more dependent than that of SARS-CoV-1 on TMPRSS2 expression. This difference can be reversed when the furin-cleavage site of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is ablated or when it is introduced into the SARS-CoV-1 S protein. We also show that hydroxychloroquine efficiently blocks viral entry mediated by cathepsin L, but not by TMPRSS2, and that a combination of hydroxychloroquine and a clinically-tested TMPRSS2 inhibitor prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection more potently than either drug alone. These studies identify functional differences between SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry processes, and provide a mechanistic explanation for the limited in vivo utility of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19.","Ou, Tianling; Mou, Huihui; Zhang, Lizhou; Ojha, Amrita; Choe, Hyeryun; Farzan, Michael",PLoS Pathog,,697

Despite the downward tendency of the diseases, hydatidosis presented high incidence. Hydatidosis performance over the years was characterized by significant increase in the number of cases, followed by marked decrease. Cysticercosis presented a decrease in number of cases at the beginning and the end of each year. These diseases have a significant socioeconomic impact as they are responsible for large losses in the livestock industry, due to reduced productivity and carcass condemnation, and represent a risk to public health.(AU)","Alberti, Taina S; Bruhn, Fabio R.

Despite the extensive studies aiming to understand the pathology of COVID-19, the clinicopathological characteristics and risk factors associated with COVID-19 remain mostly unclear. In this study, we assessed the clinical course and features of COVID-19 patients. FINDINGS: There were 59 patients (54.1%) that had no fever. One-hundred(91.7%) patients required oxygen therapy, which improved percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2). Seventy-two (66.1%) patients aged over 60; these patients were more likely to develop respiratory symptoms. Only 13(11.9%) patients were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, and computed tomography (CT) findings. We found significant differences in age, respiratory symptoms, and heart rates between patients with and without underlying conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that oxygen plays an important role in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and that age and underlying diseases are significant risk factors for COVID-19. Most COVID-19 patients have no fever, and CT provides higher detection rates than antibody- and nucleic acid-based detection methods. METHODS: We analyzed data from 109 confirmed COVID-19 cases. We compared the clinicopathological characteristic of patients stratified according to age and underlying diseases, as well as assessed the detection rates of different diagnostic methods.","Liu, Yanfang; Liu, Lina; Wang, Ye; Du, Xinyang; Ma, Hong; Yao, Jing",Aging (Albany NY),,697

Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis and can be considered as a predictor of cardiovascular risk (CVR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between CIMT-determined vascular age (VA), CVR scores, and thyroid function in asymptomatic patients with T2DM. Patients and Methods: Clinical laboratory and CIMT parameters were measured in 154 asymptomatic patients with T2DM. The Framingham risk score (FRS) was performed with chronological age (CA) and with VA. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to analyze variables related to CVR reclassification. Results: The use of CIMT-determined VA led to the reclassification of 54 (35.52%) out of 152 asymptomatic T2DM patients, being 20 (37.03%) to a lower categorical risk and 34 (62.96%) to a higher categorical risk according to FRS. The variables that were associated to reclassification to a higher categorical risk were positive family history (FH) of premature coronary artery disease (p=0.046), FH of thyroid disease (p=0.010), use of statins (p=0.027), and free T4 levels (p=0.009). Conclusion: VA determined from CIMT allowed the reclassification of the CVR in asymptomatic T2DM patients. FH of premature CAD, FH of known thyroid disease, use of statins, and free T4 levels were associated to a reclassification into a higher risk category. The use of doppler to perform CIMT measure is currently more accessible, especially in a low-middle income country like Brazil. However, further prospective studies must be performed to establish the predictive values of CIMT on atherosclerosis and how thyroid function acts like cardiovascular risk marker on CVR scores.","Palma, Cátia Cristina Silva Sousa Vergara; Lopes, Pablo Moura; Silva, Eliete Leão Clemente; Bevilaqua, Maria de Fátima da Matta; Bomfim, Alfredo de Souza; Gomes, Marilia Brito",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,,697

SARS-CoV-2 can knock down the host's cortisol stress response. Here we present a case of a 51-year-old man vomiting for 10 days after having confirmed COVID-19 infection. He had hypotension and significant hyponatraemia. Work-up was done including adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test. He was diagnosed as suffering from adrenal insufficiency and started on steroids with subsequent improvement in both blood pressure and sodium level. COVID-19 can cause adrenal insufficiency. Clinicians must be vigilant about the possibility of an underlying relative cortisol deficiency in patients with COVID-19.","Hashim, Maram; Athar, Syed; Gaba, Waqar Haider",BMJ case reports,,697
263962,The impact of COVID-19 on the private higher education system and students in Oman,2021,"The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell surface and subsequently enters host cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Additional cell receptors may be directly or indirectly involved, including integrins. The cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and integrins contain several predicted short linear motifs (SLiMs) that may facilitate internalization of the virus as well as its subsequent propagation through processes such as autophagy. Here, we measured the binding affinity of predicted interactions between SLiMs in the cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and integrin ß3 with proteins that mediate endocytic trafficking and autophagy. We validated that a class I PDZ-binding motif mediated binding of ACE2 to the scaffolding proteins SNX27, NHERF3, and SHANK, and that a binding site for the clathrin adaptor AP2 µ2 in ACE2 overlaps with a phospho-dependent binding site for the SH2 domains of Src family tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, we validated that an LC3-interacting region (LIR) in integrin ß3 bound to the ATG8 domains of the autophagy receptors MAP1LC3 and GABARAP in a manner enhanced by LIR-adjacent phosphorylation. Our results provide molecular links between cell receptors and mediators of endocytosis and autophagy that may facilitate viral entry and propagation.","Kliche, Johanna; Kuss, Hanna; Ali, Muhammad; Ivarsson, Ylva",Sci. signal,,697
265111,COVID-19 and the stock market: evidence from Twitter,2020-11-13,"Tactile edge technology that focuses on 5G or beyond 5G reveals an exciting approach to control infectious diseases such as COVID-19 internationally. The control of epidemics such as COVID-19 can be managed effectively by exploiting edge computation through the 5G wireless connectivity network. The implementation of a hierarchical edge computing system provides many advantages, such as low latency, scalability, and the protection of application and training model data, enabling COVID-19 to be evaluated by a dependable local edge server. In addition, many deep learning (DL) algorithms suffer from two crucial disadvantages: first, training requires a large COVID-19 dataset consisting of various aspects, which will pose challenges for local councils; second, to acknowledge the outcome, the findings of deep learning require ethical acceptance and clarification by the health care sector, as well as other contributors. In this article, we propose a B5G framework that utilizes the 5G network's low-latency, high-bandwidth functionality to detect COVID-19 using chest X-ray or CT scan images, and to develop a mass surveillance system to monitor social distancing, mask wearing, and body temperature. Three DL models, ResNet50, Deep tree, and Inception v3, are investigated in the proposed framework. Furthermore, blockchain technology is also used to ensure the security of healthcare data.","Shamim Hossain, M.; Muhammad, Ghulam; Guizani, Nadra",IEEE Network,,697

265959,Early Childhood Education and Care in a Post-Pandemic World: The Possibility of Reimaging the Child as an Other,2020,"By mid-May 2020, cases of COVID-19 in the UK had been declining for over a month; a multi-phase emergence from lockdown was planned, including a scheduled partial reopening of schools on 1 June 2020. Although evidence suggests that children generally display mild symptoms, the size of the school-age population means the total impact of reopening schools is unclear. Here, we present work from mid-May 2020 that focused on the imminent opening of schools and consider what these results imply for future policy. We compared eight strategies for reopening primary and secondary schools in England. Modifying a transmission model fitted to UK SARS-CoV-2 data, we assessed how reopening schools affects contact patterns, anticipated secondary infections and the relative change in the reproduction number, R. We determined the associated public health impact and its sensitivity to changes in social distancing within the wider community. We predicted that reopening schools with half-sized classes or focused on younger children was unlikely to push R above one. Older children generally have more social contacts, so reopening secondary schools results in more cases than reopening primary schools, while reopening both could have pushed R above one in some regions. Reductions in community social distancing were found to outweigh and exacerbate any impacts of reopening. In particular, opening schools when the reproduction number R is already above one generates the largest increase in cases. Our work indicates that while any school reopening will result in increased mixing and infection amongst children and the wider population, reopening schools alone in June 2020 was unlikely to push R above one. Ultimately, reopening decisions are a difficult trade-off between epidemiological consequences and the emotional, educational and developmental needs of children. Into the future, there are difficult questions about what controls can be instigated such that schools can remain open if cases increase.

All services have had to adapt to make time spent in hospital more efficient. This cycle studied our elective caesarean section (ELCS) pathway. Changes implemented included clerking patients on the telephone rather than face-to-face;staggering arrival times on the day of their ELCS;and consultant presence for all lists. Methods We analysed the health records of all ELCS in a two-week period prior to the pandemic, during implementation of change and a two-week period postimplementation. We recorded the percentage of lists performed by a consultant;total time from arrival to knife to skin (KTS);total anaesthetic time;total operating time and total time in theatre. Results Our results highlighted the number of ELCS in each two-week period stayed consistent (range 32-33). The total anaesthetic time dropped in accordance with increased consultant anaesthetic presence during the pandemic (21 minutes) compared to before (32 minutes). The percentage of lists performed by a consultant obstetrician increased from 21% to 36%. Equally, the percentage of lists performed by the consultant anaesthetist increased from 44% to 48%. The average total time from arrival to KTS dropped significantly from 211 minutes prior to the pandemic to 160 minutes during, and 169 minutes postintervention. Conclusion This cycle has successfully implemented changes in practice that have reduced waiting times for ELCS in our unit. This has been an important intervention to reduce patient contact in our waiting areas as well as improving patient satisfaction.","Sheth, S.; Patel, S.; Munro, K.",BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,,697

268428,Strategi Antisipasi Over Kapasitas Lapas Suatu Refleksi Atas Kebijakan Pencegahan Penyebaran COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Based on favourable outcomes in clinical trials, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), most notably programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, are now widely used across multiple cancer types. However, due to their strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical studies often do not address challenges presented by non-trial populations. DESIGN: This review summarises available data on the efficacy and safety of ICIs in trial-ineligible patients, including those with autoimmune disease, chronic viral infections, organ transplants, organ dysfunction, poor performance status, and brain metastases, as well as the elderly, children, and those who are pregnant. In addition, we review data concerning other real-world challenges with ICIs, including timing of therapy switch, relationships to radiotherapy or surgery, re-treatment after an immune-related toxicity, vaccinations in patients on ICIs, and current experience around ICI and coronavirus disease-19. Where possible, we provide recommendations to aid the often-difficult decision-making process in those settings. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that ICIs are often active and have an acceptable safety profile in the populations described above, with the exception of PD-1 inhibitors in solid organ transplant recipients. Decisions about whether to treat with ICIs should be personalised and require multidisciplinary input and careful counselling of patients with respect to potential risks and benefits. Clinical judgements need to be carefully weighed, considering factors such as underlying cancer type, feasibility of alternative treatment options, or activity in trial-eligible patients.","Rzeniewicz, K; Larkin, J; Menzies, A M; Turajlic, S",Ann Oncol,,697
268540,Remotely teaching Arduino by means of an online simulator,2020,"SARS CoV-2 variants raise significant concerns due to their ability to cause vaccine breakthrough infections. Here, we sequence-characterized the spike gene, isolated from a breakthrough infection, that corresponded to B.1.617.3 lineage. Delineating the functional impact of spike mutations using reporter pseudoviruses (PV) revealed that N-terminal domain (NTD)-specific E156G/{Delta}157-158 contributed to increased infectivity and reduced sensitivity to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Covishield)-elicited neutralizing antibodies. A six-nucleotide deletion (467-472) in the spike coding region introduced this change in the NTD. We confirmed the presence of E156G/{Delta}157-158 in the RT-PCR-positive cases concurrently screened, in addition to other circulating spike (S1) mutations like T19R, T95I, L452R, E484Q, and D614G. Notably, E156G/{Delta}157-158 was present in more than 85% of the sequences reported from the USA, UK, and India in August 2021. The spike PV bearing combination of E156G/{Delta}157-158 and L452R further promoted infectivity and conferred immune evasion. Additionally, increased cell-to-cell fusion was observed when spike harbored E156G/{Delta}157-158, L452R, and E484Q, suggesting a combinatorial effect of these mutations. Notwithstanding, the plasma from a recovered individual robustly inhibited mutant spike PV, indicating the increased breadth of neutralization post-recovery. Our data highlights the importance of spike NTD-specific changes in determining infectivity and immune escape of variants.","Mishra, Tarun; Joshi, Garima; Kumar, Atul; Dalavi, Rishikesh; Pandey, Pankaj; Shukla, Sanjeev; Mishra, Ram Kumar; Chande, Ajit",,,697

269739,For the greater good? Data and disasters in a post-COVID world,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The aim: This article aims to analyze the rates of suicide as an indicator of public mental health, to consider the suicidal map of the territory of Ukraine (including to check the manifestation of such a territorial characteristic as the Albanian paradox); calculate the price of suicide for the socio-economic development of the Ukrainian state, consider the risks of suicide that have arisen as social and criminological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The study is based on the analytical materials of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the WHO; the information and analytical data of the GeneralProsecutor's Office of Ukraine, the State Statistics Service of Ukraine and sectoral statistics for the period of 2015-2019, etc. The article is based on dialectical, analytical, synthetic, comparative, statistical, cartographic, and sociological methods of research and the method of potential demography. The theoretical basis of the article is specialized literature on medicine, suicidology, law, sociology, and cartography. RESULTS: Results: In Ukraine, the death rate from suicide in recent years averages 1.1% of the total number of deaths. The rate of suicide decline in Ukraine has slowed significantly over the past five years, which is an alarming symptom. There are almost strict proportions between male and female suicide (men commit four out of five suicides). The level of self-harm per 100,000 population of Ukraine remains almost stable, indicating a severe demographic crisis in Ukraine. Women in Ukraine are less likely to commit suicide than in European countries. In Ukraine in recent years, contrary to European trends, suicide has dominated among the elderly aged 65+. The number of years of potential life loss for male and female suicides in Ukraine is 103 thousand, and the number of working years is almost 100 thousand. The losses for Ukraine from the unlived life of those who died as a result of suicide in 2019 are almost USD 341 billion. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: In 2019, suicides accounted for almost 21% of deaths from external causes among Ukraine's population. The most intense suicidal situation is observed in the central part of the country's geographical map along the imaginary vertical axis ""North-South"" (Kherson, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhia, Kirovohrad, Sumy, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv regions).

Combining historical research of the Tudor and Stuart periods with information sources and broadcast news as the epidemic in England unfolds in real time during lockdown, the areas of official guidance, epidemiology, social distancing and quarantine, financing measures, the national health service and fake news are compared. Then as now, limits on freedom of movement and congregation, social distancing and quarantine measures were applied for the sake of preserving life, loss of livelihood ameliorated by government loans and inconvenient opinions suppressed, and these suggest a commonality of organised responses to mass infection across times. Increased danger in certain necessary occupations and flight to second homes by the rich have been observed, health inequities uncovered and restrictions on being with the dying and burying the dead enforced. Wholly unprecedented in comparison with the past, when the wealthiest in a parish were taxed to pay for measures against plague, is the quarantining of the whole society and the financial package for workers on furlough to avoid mass unemployment. In the new normal after lockdown, people should be given more credit for sophisticated understanding than was allowed in past centuries, when fear and punishment coerced the majority to conform, and be allowed access to relevant information which will influence decisions about national and community life going forward after lockdown.","Tobyn, Graeme",Soc Sci Humanit Open,,697

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A) is overexpressed in malignant tumors, including STS, and can be targeted with bevacizumab-800CW during fluorescence-guided surgery for real-time tumor detection. In this phase 1 clinical trial, we determined the feasibility, safety and optimal dose of bevacizumab-800CW for fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) in STS for in- and ex vivo tumor detection. Methods: Patients with a histopathologically diagnosis of STS were included. In the dose-escalation phase, patients received bevacizumab-800CW intravenously 3 days prior to surgery (10, 25 and 50 mg, n = 8). In the subsequent dose-expansion phase, 7 additional patients received bevacizumab-800CW at the optimal dose. Fluorescence images in- and ex vivo were obtained during all stages of standard of care. The optimal dose was determined by calculating in- and ex vivo Tumor-to-Background ratios (TBR) and correlating these results with histopathology. Results: Fifteen patients with STS completed this study. All tumors could be visualized during in- and ex vivo imaging. The optimal bevacizumab-800CW dose proved to be 10 mg with a median in vivo TBR of 2.0 (±0.58) and an ex vivo TBR of 2.67 (±1.6). All seven tumor-positive margins could be observed real-time after surgical resection. Conclusion: FGS using 10 mg bevacizumab-800CW is feasible and safe for intra-operative imaging of STS, potentially allowing tumor detection and margin assessment during surgery.

276871,Are universities using the right assessment tools during the pandemic and crisis times?,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemichas caused our daily routines to change quickly. The pandemic provokes public fear, resulting in changes in what modes of transport people use to perform their daily activities. It is imperative for transportation authorities to properly identify the different degrees of behavioral change among various social groups. A major factor that can substantially explain individuals’ behavioral changes is the personal risk perceptions toward using shared mobility solutions. Thus, this study explores the risk that individuals perceive while using public transit and ridesharing services (as the most widespread forms of shared mobility) during the COVID-19 pandemic. To do so, we designed and implemented a multidimensional travel-behavior survey in the Chicago metropolitan area that comprises socio-demographic information and retrospective questions related to attitudes and travel behavior before and during the pandemic. Utilizing a bivariate ordered probit modeling approach to better account for the potential correlation between unobserved factors, we simultaneously modeled the perceived risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus in case of riding transit and using ridesharing services. A wide range of factors is found to be influential on the perceived risk of using shared mobility services, including the socio-demographic attributes, built environment settings, and the virus spread. Further, our results indicate that the mitigation strategies to increase the ridership of shared mobility services should be adaptive considering the spatial variations.","Rahimi, Ehsan Shabanpour Ramin Shamshiripour Ali Mohammadian Abolfazl",Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour,,697

Methods: Data were accessed on April 4, 2020, from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Report, and the United States Census Bureau to report prevalence of COVID-19 infections, mobility data, and population per state, respectively. Mobility data points were defined as daily length of visit or time spent in a single location based on mobile phone users shared locations from February 7 - March 29, 2020. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate relationships between normalized per capita infection prevalence and six parameters of social distancing. Results: Mobility data indicated the following percent changes compared to median values of baseline activity: -50% in transit stations, -45% in retail/recreation, -36% in workplaces, -23% in grocery/pharmacy, -19% in parks, and +12% in residential living areas. Multivariable linear regression revealed significant correlation between prevalence of infection per capita and parameters of social distancing (R= 0.604, P= 0.002). Time at home was not an independent predictor for prevalence of infection per capita (beta= 0.016;95% CI, -0.003 to 0.036;P= 0.09). Conclusion: Based on mobility reports from mobile phone GPS data and six characteristics of social distancing, significant associations were identified between geographic activity and prevalence of COVID-19 infections in the U.S. per capita. Mobile phone data utilizing 'location history' may be warranted to monitor the effectiveness of social distancing parameters on reducing prevalence of COVID-19 in the U.S.","DePhillipo, N.

279565,The effects of CRF and the urocortins on the hippocampal acetylcholine release in rats,2021,"Prior studies examined association between short-term mortality and certain changes in the admission ECG in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Nevertheless, little is known about possible differences between patients with diabetes and without diabetes in this regard. So the aim of the study was to investigate the association between 28-day case fatality according to certain ECG changes comparing AMI cases with and without diabetes from the general population. From 2000 until 2017 a total of 9756 AMI cases was prospectively recorded in the study Area of Augsburg, Germany. Each case was assigned to one of the following groups according to admission ECG: 'ST-elevation', 'ST-depression', 'only T-negativity', 'predominantly bundle branch block', 'unspecific changes' and 'normal ECG' (the last two were put together for regression analyses). Multivariable adjusted logistic regression models were calculated to compare 28-day case-fatality between the ECG groups for the total sample and separately for diabetes and non-diabetes cases. For the non-diabetes group, the parsimonious logistic regression model revealed significantly better 28-day-outcome for the 'normal ECG / unspecific changes' group (OR: 0.47 [0.29-0.76]) compared to the reference group (STEMI). Contrary, in AMI cases with diabetes the category 'normal ECG / unspecific changes' was not significantly associated with lower short-term mortality (OR: 0.87 [0.49-1.54]). Neither of the other ECG groups was significantly associated with 28-day-mortality in the parsimonious logistic regression models. Consequently, the absence of AMI-typical changes in the admission ECG predicts favorable short-term mortality only in non-diabetic cases, but not so in patients with diabetes.","Schmitz, Timo; Thilo, Christian; Linseisen, Jakob; Heier, Margit; Peters, Annette; Kuch, Bernhard; Meisinger, Christa",Sci Rep,,697

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: An email survey was sent to 474 HCW at a Midwestern HealthCare facility between April 9, 2020 and April 30, 2020. A total of 311 (65.6%) responses were received by May 31, 2020. The survey utilized 3 validated instruments: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), Brief Resilience Coping Scale (BRCS). RESULTS: Of the 311 responses, 302 were evaluated: 97 from nonmedical staff with patient contact (NMPC); 86 from nonmedical staff with no patient contact (NMNPC); 62 from medical doctors (MD), physician assistants (PA) and nurse practitioners (NP); and 57 from nurses. Significant differences were noted across job categories for stress and resilience, with nurses reporting highest PSS scores (effect estimates: -2.72, P = .009 for NMNPC; -2.50, P = .015 for NMPC; -3.21, P = .006 for MD/NP/PA respectively), and MD/NP/PA group with highest BRS scores: nurses (-0.31, P = .02); NMPC (-0.3333, P = .01); and NMNPC (-0.2828, P = .02). Younger personnel had higher stress (-1.59 per decade of age, P < .01) and more resilience (0.11 per decade of age, P = .002). CONCLUSION: These self-reported data indicate that MD/NP/PA had the highest resilience scores and the nurses had highest stress levels. Efforts are warranted to include all HCWs in systematic stress mitigating interventions with particular attention to understand specific factors contributing to stress for the nursing team.","Croghan, Ivana T; Chesak, Sherry S; Adusumalli, Jayanth; Fischer, Karen M; Beck, Elizabeth W; Patel, Shruti R; Ghosh, Karthik; Schroeder, Darrell R; Bhagra, Anjali",J Prim Care Community Health,,697

METHODS: An online survey is conducted to asses psychological responses of healthcare workers and related factors during Covid-19 outbreak. It is consisted of three subsections covering the following areas: 1) sociodemographic data 2) information on individuals` working condition 3) Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DAS-21). RESULTS: Of all 442 participants, 286 (64.7%) had symptoms of depression, 224 (51.6%) anxiety, and 182 (41.2%) stress. Being female, young, and single, having less work experience, working in frontline were associated with higher scores, whereas having a child was associated with lower scores in each subscale. Factors found to be associated with higher DAS-21 total scores in frontline workers were as follows: increased weekly working hours, increased number of Covid-19 patients cared for, lower level of support from peers and supervisors, lower logistic support, and lower feelings of competence during Covid-19 related tasks. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the factors which need to be taken into consideration to protect the mental wellbeing of doctors while fighting with a disaster that has major impacts on society worldwide.","Elbay, Rümeysa Yeni; Kurtulmus, Ayse; Arpacioglu, Selim; Karadere, Emrah",Psychiatry Res,,697
282628,Evolution of hoteliers’ organizational crisis communication in the time of mega disruption,2021,"BACKGROUND: The decision to biopsy a peripheral nerve tumor is largely based on its presumed behavior and prognosis, determined by patient history, clinical exam, and radiologic characteristics. Percutaneous image-guided biopsy is not without risk in patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs); in particular, there may be concern regarding worsening neurologic function, increasing neuropathic pain, and incorrect or absent diagnosis. METHODS: Following approval by our institutional review board, we reviewed records from 1990 to 2019 at our institution's three main sites (""our institution""). Patients with pathology-proven MPNST were selected. Further inclusion criteria included image-guided percutaneous biopsy performed at our institution, pathology report available for review, and follow-up documentation to determine post-biopsy complications. RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-one patients with MPNST were reviewed. In total, 73 patients undergoing image-guided percutaneous biopsies were included. Twenty-two (30.1%) had biopsy-related complications. This included ten patients with misdiagnosis (13.7%) and six patients with non-diagnostic biopsies (8.2%). Six patients had new or worsened pain that resolved with time and neuropathic pain medication (8.2%), and one patient had subjectively worsened proximal weakness (1.3%) which resolved. CONCLUSION: We found nearly a third of patients undergoing biopsy had a biopsy-related complication. The single largest complication was the inability to obtain an accurate diagnosis (21.9%) with the first biopsy. This may lead to the need for repeat percutaneous or open biopsies, or a non-oncologic initial surgery with implications for disease-free and overall survival. Neurologic complications including exacerbation of pain or a deficit were rare and transient. It remains important that clinicians balance the potential risks and benefits based on individual patient characteristics when determining the necessity of an image-guided percutaneous biopsy.","Pendleton, Courtney; Howe, B Matthew; Spinner, Robert J",Acta neurochir,,697

Recent data provides compelling evidence for the neurotropic nature of SARS-CoV-2, based on neurological manifestations reported during the current pandemic, as well as on previous experience with other coronaviruses. We present the case of a patient who developed headaches, motor deficit and dysphasia after respiratory COVID-19. Imaging tests showed heterogeneous central nervous system lesions (multiple subarachnoid hemorrhages and two ischemic strokes). Given the plethora of atypical neurological complications of COVID-19 described in the current literature, establishing a positive diagnosis and deciding on a treatment plan proved to be particularly challenging. We set to discuss some of the possible pathologies, hypothesized to be associated with COVID-19, that could lead to concomitant neurological lesions, similar to those noticed in our patient.","Vacaras, Vitalie; Frunze, Sorina; Cordos, Adrian Mihai",J Med Life,,697

In our campus, a scan of the QR code is also required to register on the campus cloud system for a footprint record. Therefore, before class, many students are waiting in line, and each student needs to spend about 10 minutes for the entire process. Hence, we designed a new campus epidemic prevention system against the threat of COVID-19. The system can automatically perform the forehead temperature measurement, hand sanitizing and ID register on each user. The manually operated issues, such as infection risk of operators, manpower requirement of epidemic prevention stations, and the entire process times, can all be reduced.

As of 21 March 2020, this epidemic has spread to 179 countries with more than 200 000 confirmed cases and 8578 deaths. The outbreak has put enormous pressure on the medical establishment and even led to exhaustion of medical resources in the most affected areas. Other medical work has been significantly affected in the context of COVID-19 epidemic. In order to reduce or avoid cross-infection with COVID-19, many hospitals have taken measures to limit the number of outpatient visits and inpatients. For example, emergency surgery can only be guaranteed, and most other surgeries can be postponed. Patients with cancer are one of the groups most affected by the epidemic because of their systematic immunosuppressive state and requirement of frequent admission to hospital. Consequently, specific adjustments for their treatment need to be made to cope with this situation.

METHODS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies were measured at three time points during the 30-week follow-up. COVID-19-specific symptoms were assessed with standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: 95% of the participants mounted an IgG response with only modest decline after week 12. IgG-type antibodies were still detectable in almost 90% of the subjects at 30 weeks. IgA and IgM responses were less robust and antibody titers decreased more rapidly. At 30 weeks, only 25% still had detectable IgA-type and none had IgM-type antibodies. Higher age and higher disease severity were independently associated with higher IgG antibody levels, albeit with wide variations. CONCLUSION: Serological immune responses after COVID-19 show considerable inter-individual variability, but show an association with increasing age and higher severity of disease. IgG-type anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remain positive in 90% of the individuals 30 weeks after onset of symptoms.","Glück, Vivian; Grobecker, Sonja; Tydykov, Leonid; Salzberger, Bernd; Glück, Thomas; Weidlich, Tanja; Bertok, Manuela; Gottwald, Christine; Wenzel, Jürgen J; Gessner, André; Schmidt, Barbara; Peterhoff, David",Infection,,697

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multi-center study, and followed up with all children from the families with SARS-CoV-2 infected members in Zhejiang Province, China. All infections were confirmed by testing the SARS-CoV-2 RNA with RT-PCR method, and epidemiological data between children and adults in the same families was compared. Effect of antiviral therapy was evaluated observationally and fecal viral excretion times among groups with different antiviral regiments were compared with Kaplan Meier plot. RESULTS: By February 29, 2020, 1298 cases from 883 families were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 314 of which were families with children. Incidence of infection in child close contacts was significantly lower than that in adult contacts (13.2% vs 21.2%). The mean age of 43 pediatric cases was 8.2 years and mean incubation period was 9.1 days. Forty (93.0%) were family clustering. Thirty-three children had COVID-19 (20 pneumonia) with mild symptoms and 10 were asymptomatic. Fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was positive in 91.4% (32/35) cases and some children had viral excretion time over 70 days. Viral clearance time was not different among the groups treated with different antiviral regiments. No subsequent infection was observed in family contacts of fecal-viral-excreting children. CONCLUSION: Children have lower susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection, longer incubation and fecal viral excretion time. Positive results of fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection were not used as indication for hospitalization or quarantine. This article is protected by copyright.

QTc &#8805; 500 ms and delta QTc > 60 ms from baseline were deemed serious. Twenty-two cases presented with 28 cardiac adverse reactions associated with the empirical use of lopinavir/ritonavir in a hospital setting. Most adverse reactions reflected lopinavir/ritonavir potency to block voltage-gated potassium channels with 5 ventricular arrhythmias and 17 QTc prolongations. An average QTc augmentation of 97 ± 69 ms was reported. Twelve QTc prolongations were deemed serious. Other cases were likely related to lopinavir/ritonavir potency to block sodium channels: 1 case of bundle branch block and 5 recurrent bradycardias. The incidence of cardiac adverse reactions of lopinavir/ritonavir was estimated between 0.3% and 0.4%. These cardiac adverse drug reactions offer a new insight in its ancillary multi-channel blocking functions. Lopinavir/ritonavir cardiotoxicity may be of concern for its empirical use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caution should be exerted relative to this risk where lopinavir/ritonavir summary of product characteristics should be implemented accordingly.","Fresse, Audrey; Viard, Delphine; Romani, Serena; Gérard, Alexandre; Lepelley, Marion; Rocher, Fanny; Salem, Joe-Elie; Drici, Milou-Daniel",Int. j. cardiol,,697

288679,How to pay for the coronavirus emergency: The fiscal challenge,2021,"There is a lack of empirical information regarding anatomy education for Occupational Therapists (OTs). Human anatomy is taught in a variety of ways by a variety of people across allied health. Insufficient anatomy education can result in underprepared entry-level OTs, who then produce increased practice errors and reduced patient care (Schofield, 2017). The objective of this study was to investigate how human gross anatomy was taught in OT programs throughout the United States prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and how inadequate anatomy education can impact practicing OTs. A mixed-methods cross-sectional descriptive survey was sent to the directors of OT programs throughout the US. Survey responses were compiled to best represent the current OT education environment. The initial survey gathered the following types of information: 1) The participant's role in the institution's OT program;2) The participant's experience in OT and education;3) The location, duration, and type of OT program(s) present at the institution;4) Who is typically assigned to teach gross anatomy to OT students;5) How gross anatomy is typically taught to OT students;6) Strengths and weakness of the institution's gross anatomy education;7) Possible consequences of inadequate anatomy education for entry-level OTs;and 8) Comparing the participant's personal experience in the field of OT to their recommendations about how human gross anatomy should be taught to OT students. The quantitative data were analyzed to present descriptive statistics. The qualitative data was assessed using thematic analysis. The findings of this study will inform allied health educators about the current methods being implemented in OT programs for teaching gross anatomy and offer potential avenues for improvement.","Veazey, Kathryn Robertson Ellen",The FASEB Journal,,697

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Recommendations based on the consensus conference model. RESULTS: In the case of a COVID-19 positive patient, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, the place of surgery must be re-evaluated in relation to radiotherapy and Radio-Chemotherapy-Concomitant and the value of lymph node staging surgeries must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy should be favored even if primary cytoreduction surgery could be envisaged. It is lawful not to offer hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during a COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of patients who must undergo interval surgery, it is possible to continue the chemotherapy and to offer surgery after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. For early stage endometrial cancer, in case of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy associated with a sentinel lymph node procedure should be favored. It is possible to consider postponing surgery for 1 to 2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For high ESMO risk, it ispossible to favor the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) in order to omit pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomies. CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 pandemic, patients suffering from cancer should not lose life chance, while limiting the risks associated with the virus.","Akladios, C; Azais, H; Ballester, M; Bendifallah, S; Bolze, P-A; Bourdel, N; Bricou, A; Canlorbe, G; Carcopino, X; Chauvet, P; Collinet, P; Coutant, C; Dabi, Y; Dion, L; Gauthier, T; Graesslin, O; Huchon, C; Koskas, M; Kridelka, F; Lavoue, V; Lecointre, L; Mezzadri, M; Mimoun, C; Ouldamer, L; Raimond, E; Touboul, C",Gynecol Obstet Fertil Senol,,697

291438,Acute Vision Loss in a Patient with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected more than 89 million people worldwide. As the pandemic rages on, more complications of the disease are being recognized, including stroke, cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic events, encephalopathy, seizures, and more. Peripheral nervous system involvement, particularly Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), is of special interest, given the increasing reports of cases related to COVID-19. Because of the potentially delayed onset of symptoms of polyradiculoneuropathy and weakness after the traditional COVID-19 symptoms, it is vitally important for emergency physicians to be vigilant and to consider GBS as part of their differential diagnosis. GBS usually occurs after an infectious insult, and a variety of culprit pathogens have been identified in the literature. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 35-year-old man who developed GBS after being diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. The patient displayed classic symptoms of neuropathy, areflexia, and lower extremity weakness. Cerebrospinal fluid evaluation demonstrated albuminocytologic dissociation seen in GBS, although anti-ganglioside autoantibodies were negative. These antibodies are often negative and do not exclude the diagnosis. The patient responded clinically to intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and was discharged home. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: This case report contributes further evidence that COVID-19 joins other organisms as causes of GBS. Emergency physicians are the first point of contact for many patients. Increased awareness of this complication of COVID-19 will lead to higher detection. Prompt recognition could lead to speedier and more complete neurologic recovery of affected patients.","Yakoby, Jordan; Litvak, Ilya; Yu, Edward",J. emerg. med,,697

291645,Social distancing versus early detection and contacts tracing in epidemic management,2020-03-31,"It has been confirmed that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can transmit through droplets created when an infected human coughs or sneezes. Accordingly, 1.83-m (6-feet) social distancing is advised to reduce the spread of the disease among humans. This is based on the assumption that no air circulation exists around people. However, it is not well investigated whether the ambient wind and relative humidity (RH) will cause SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets to transport farther in the air, and make the current social distancing policy insufficient. To provide evidence and insight into the ""social distancing"" guidelines, a validated computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) model was employed to simulate the transient transport, condensation/evaporation, and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets emitted by coughs, with different environmental wind velocities and RHs. Initial droplet diameters range from 2 to 2000 µm, and the wind velocities range from 0 to 16 km/h, representing different wind forces from calm air to moderate breeze. The comparison between a steady-state wind and a gust with a constant frequency has also been performed. Ambient RHs are 40% and 99.5%. The distances between the two virtual humans are 1.83 m and 3.05 m (6 feet and 10 feet). The facial covering effect on reducing the airborne transmission of the cough droplets has also been evaluated. Numerical results indicate that the ambient wind will enhance the complexity of the secondary flows with recirculation between the two virtual humans. Microdroplets follow the airflow streamlines well and deposit on both human bodies and head regions, even with the 3.05-m (10-feet) separation distance. The rest of the microdroplets can transport in the air farther than 3.05 m (10 feet) due to wind convection, causing a potential health risk to nearby people. High RH will increase the droplet sizes due to the hygroscopic growth effect, which increases the deposition fractions on both humans and the ground. With the complex environmental wind and RH conditions, the 6-feet social distancing policy may not be sufficient to protect the inter-person aerosol transmission, since the suspending micro-droplets were influenced by convection effects and can transport from the human coughs/sneezes to the other human in less than 5 seconds. Due to the complex real-world environmental ventilation conditions, a social distance longer than 1.83 m (6 feet) needs to be considered. Wearing masks should also be recommended for both infected and healthy humans to reduce the airborne cough droplet numbers.","Feng, Yu; Marchal, Thierry; Sperry, Ted; Yi, Hang",J Aerosol Sci,,697

OBJECTIVES: In this study, we investigated discourses on HIPAA in relation to COVID-19. METHODS: Through a search of media sources in the Factiva database, relevant texts were identified. We applied a text mining approach to identify concepts and themes in these texts. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed six central themes, namely, Health, HIPAA, Privacy, Security, Patients, and Need, as well as their associated concepts. Among these, Health was the most frequently discussed theme. It comprised concepts such as public, care, emergency, providers, telehealth, entity, use, discretion, OCR, Health and Human Services (HHS), enforcement, business, and services. CONCLUSION: Our discourse analysis of media outlets highlights the role of health data privacy law in the response to global public health emergencies and demonstrates how discourse analysis and computational methods can inform health data protection policymaking in the digital health era.","Pool, Javad; Akhlaghpour, Saeed; Fatehi, Farhad",Stud Health Technol Inform,,697

Nevertheless, there are few relevant studies. In the research, we collected tweet posts by the UK and US residents from the Twitter API during the pandemic and designed experiments to answer three main questions concerning vaccination. To get the dominant sentiment of the civics, we performed sentiment analysis by VADER and proposed a new method that can count the individual's influence. This allows us to go a step further in sentiment analysis and explain some of the fluctuations in the data changing. The results indicated that celebrities could lead the opinion shift on social media in vaccination progress. Moreover, at the peak, nearly 40\% of the population in both countries have a negative attitude towards COVID-19 vaccines. Besides, we investigated how people's opinions toward different vaccine brands are. We found that the Pfizer vaccine enjoys the most popular among people. By applying the sentiment analysis tool, we discovered most people hold positive views toward the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by most brands. In the end, we carried out topic modelling by using the LDA model. We found residents in the two countries are willing to share their views and feelings concerning the vaccine. Several death cases have occurred after vaccination. Due to these negative events, US residents are more worried about the side effects and safety of the vaccine.","Na, Tao; Cheng, Wei; Li, Dongming; Lu, Wanyu; Li, Hongjiang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04081v1.pdf,697
293255,Corporate social responsibility and COVID-19: Research implications,2020,"Mobility restrictions have been identified as key non-pharmaceutical interventions to limit the spread of the SARS-COV-2 epidemics. However, these interventions present significant drawbacks to the social fabric and negative outcomes for the real economy. In this paper we propose a real-time monitoring framework for tracking the economic consequences of various forms of mobility reductions involving European countries. We adopt a granular representation of mobility patterns during both the first and second waves of SARS-COV-2 in Italy, Germany, France and Spain to provide an analytical characterization of the rate of losses of industrial production by means of a nowcasting methodology. Our approach exploits the information encoded in massive datasets of human mobility provided by Facebook and Google, which are published at higher frequencies than the target economic variables, in order to obtain an early estimate before the official data becomes available. Our results show, in first place, the ability of mobility-related policies to induce a contraction of mobility patterns across jurisdictions. Besides this contraction, we observe a substitution effect which increases mobility within jurisdictions. Secondly, we show how industrial production strictly follows the dynamics of population commuting patterns and of human mobility trends, which thus provide information on the day-by-day variations in countries' economic activities. Our work, besides shedding light on how policy interventions targeted to induce a mobility contraction impact the real economy, constitutes a practical toolbox for helping governments to design appropriate and balanced policy actions aimed at containing the SARS-COV-2 spread, while mitigating the detrimental effect on the economy. Our study reveals how complex mobility patterns can have unequal consequences to economic losses across countries and call for a more tailored implementation of restrictions to balance the containment of contagion with the need to sustain economic activities.","Spelta, Alessandro; Pagnottoni, Paolo",Sci Rep,,697

In this paper, we propose and develop an intelligent system named Dr.HIN to protect users against the evolving Android malware attacks in the COVID-19 era and beyond. In Dr.HIN, besides app content, we propose to consider higher-level semantics and social relations among apps, developers and mobile devices to comprehensively depict Android apps;and then we introduce a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN) to model the complex relations and exploit meta-path guided strategy to learn node (i.e., app) representations from HIN. As the representations of malware could be highly entangled with benign apps in the complex ecosystem of development, it poses a new challenge of learning the latent explanatory factors hidden in the HIN embeddings to detect the evolving malware. To address this challenge, we propose to integrate domain priors generated from different views (i.e., app content, app authorship, app installation) to devise an adversarial disentangler to separate the distinct, informative factors of variations hidden in the HIN embeddings for large-scale Android malware detection. This is the first attempt of disentangled representation learning in HIN data. Promising experimental results based on real sample collections from security industry demonstrate the performance of Dr.HIN in evolving Android malware detection, by comparison with baselines and popular mobile security products.","Hou, S.

296759,Spike D614G - A Candidate Vaccine Antigen Against Covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Azithromycin is an orally active synthetic macrolide antibiotic with a wide range of anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. It is a safe, inexpensive, generic licenced drug available worldwide and manufactured to scale and is a potential candidate therapy for pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Azithromycin was widely used to treat severe SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but to date, no randomised data are available in any coronavirus infections. Other ongoing trials are exploring short courses of azithromycin either in early disease, within the first 7 days of symptoms, when azithromycin's antiviral properties may be important, or late in disease when anti-bacterial properties may reduce the risk of secondary bacterial infection. However, the molecule's anti-inflammatory properties, including suppression of pulmonary macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins-1ß, -6, -8, and -18 and cytokines G-CSF and GM-CSF may provide a distinct therapeutic benefit if given in as a prolonged course during the period of progression from moderate to severe disease. METHODS: ATOMIC2 is a phase II/III, multi-centre, prospective, open-label, two-arm randomised superiority clinical trial of azithromycin versus standard care for adults presenting to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms who are not admitted at initial presentation. We will enrol adults, &#8805; 18 years of age assessed in acute hospitals in the UK with clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 infection where management on an ambulatory care pathway is deemed appropriate. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to usual care or to azithromycin 500 mg orally daily for 14 days with telephone follow-up at days 14 and 28. The primary objective is to compare the proportion with either death or respiratory failure requiring invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation over 28 days from randomisation. Secondary objectives include mortality/respiratory failure in those with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis; all-cause mortality; progression to pneumonia; progression to severe pneumonia; peak severity of illness and mechanistic analysis of blood and nasal biomarkers. DISCUSSION: This trial will determine the clinical utility of azithromycin in patients with moderately severe, clinically diagnosed COVID-19 and could be rapidly applicable worldwide.

Testing a general framework of compliance with virtual measures of social distancing,2021,"Segmentation of infected areas in chest CT volumes is of great significance for further diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients. Due to the complex shapes and varied appearances of lesions, a large number of voxel-level labeled samples are generally required to train a lesion segmentation network, which is a main bottleneck for developing deep learning based medical image segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised lesion segmentation framework by embedding the Generative Adversarial training process into the Segmentation Network, which is called GASNet. GASNet is optimized to segment the lesion areas of a COVID-19 CT by the segmenter, and to replace the abnormal appearance with a generated normal appearance by the generator, so that the restored CT volumes are indistinguishable from healthy CT volumes by the discriminator. GASNet is supervised by chest CT volumes of many healthy and COVID-19 subjects without voxel-level annotations. Experiments on three public databases show that when using as few as one voxel-level labeled sample, the performance of GASNet is comparable to fully-supervised segmentation algorithms trained on dozens of voxel-level labeled samples.","Xu, Zhanwei; Cao, Yukun; Jin, Cheng; Shao, Guozhu; Liu, Xiaoqing; Zhou, Jie; Shi, Heshui; Feng, Jianjiang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.09456v1.pdf,697

300796,"COVID-19 in Singapore and New Zealand: Newspaper portrayal, crisis management",2021,"This paper argues that the COVID-19 has illuminated epistemological and ontological limitations underpinning the established modernity order, and the associated capitalist system. The pandemic has in particular uncovered economic disparities and institutional failures, race, anti-Black racism and exploitation, conspiracy conceptions, mistrust, and aggressive competition;all of which point to the imperative to subvert the dominant Euro-exclusive claim of modernity. Drawing on global examples, it is contended that there is a need for a much deeper reflection on the asili that drives modernity and the established education systems. The paper further points to some key tenets that should characterize education in order to promote a more sustainable world with potency to develop a new consciousness, underpinned by a re-configured ontology or asili. To achieve this, the paper uses as its framework of analysis the critique of the dominant modernity and Eurocentricism, as well as decoloniality and Afrocentricity theories.

Consumption and identity between reproduction of social inequalities and social transformation in Brazil,2020,"Schools around the world were closed during the spring 2020 lockdown to reduce the spread of COVID-19. As such, these rapid changes to adolescent daily routines may have had immediate as well as long-term effects on their physical, social, and mental health. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the experiences, health behaviors and perceived change in health behaviors among adolescents in Czechia during the spring 2020 lockdown. Adolescents (n = 3,440, 54% girls;Mage = 13.5 years, SD = 1.6) from all regions of Czechia were recruited to complete a self-report survey based on the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study, with additional items on household disruptions and socialization during lockdown, as well as items on perceived changes in health behaviors during lockdown. First, we described the self-reported impacts of the spring lockdown by gender and grade. Second, log-linear analyses were used to examine the perceived behavioral changes based on standardized cut-off values reporting for health behaviors and gender. Less than a third, 19% and 32% of the respondents reported economic and psychosocial disruptions to their family life, 79% indicated they had positive opportunities for family interactions or learning new things. Girls and older adolescents reported the worst levels of social and mental well-being. Changes in respondents’ perceived health behaviors varied by reported behavior frequencies and gender. These results may be useful to compare with future secular trends, and may serve as input in developing strategies to counter the impact of the spring 2020 or future similar lockdowns on the adolescents' well-being..","Ng, Kwok Cosma Alina Svacina Karel Boniel-Nissim Meyran Badura Petr",Preventive Medicine Reports,,697

There is a lack of clear consensus on when to switch patients from trials of noninvasive therapies to invasive mechanical ventilation. We investigated the effect of the timing of intubation from the time of admission on the clinical outcome of CARDS. Aim and objective: The aim was to analyze the effect of timing of intubation early (within 48 hours of admission to critical care unit) versus delayed (after 48 hours of admission to critical care unit) on mortality in severe CARDS patients. Materials and methods: A retrospective observational study performed in a 28-bedded coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital in Pune, India. All patients admitted between April 1, 2020, and October 15, 2020, with confirmed COVID-19 (RT-PCR positive) requiring mechanical ventilation were included in the study. Results: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Among 2,230 patients that were admitted to the hospital, 525 required critical care (23.5%), invasive mechanical ventilation was needed in 162 patients and 147 (28%) of critical care admission were included in the study cohort after exclusion. Seventy-five patients (51%) were intubated within 48 hours of critical care admission (early group) and 72 (48.9%) were intubated after 48 hours of critical care admission (delayed group). With regards to the total of 147 included patients;male patients were 74.1% with a median age of 59 years (interquartile range, 51-68 years). Diabetes (44.9%) and hypertension (43.5%) were the most common comorbidities. Higher admission acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II scores and lower absolute lymphocyte count were observed in patients intubated within 48 hours.

303282,A protocol for development of holistic-entrepreneur graduates: Emotional intelligence perspectives,2021,"PURPOSE: This study was conducted to evaluate the role of liver sonography in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and elevated liver enzymes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in our emergency ward between January 01 and April 24, 2020 and elevated liver enzymes were included (Cohort 1). Additionally, the local radiology information system was screened for sonographies in COVID-19 patients at the intensive care unit in the same period (Cohort 2). Liver sonographies and histologic specimen were reviewed and suspicious findings recorded. Medical records were reviewed for clinical data. Ultrasound findings and clinical data were correlated with severity of liver enzyme elevation. RESULTS: Cohort 1: 126 patients were evaluated, of which 47 (37.3%) had elevated liver enzymes. Severity of liver enzyme elevation was associated with death (p<0.001). 8 patients (6.3%) had suspicious ultrasound findings, including signs of acute hepatitis (n = 5, e.g. thickening of gall bladder wall, hepatomegaly, decreased echogenicity of liver parenchyma) and vascular complications (n = 4). Cohort 2: 39 patients were evaluated, of which 14 are also included in Cohort 1. 19 patients (48.7%) had suspicious ultrasound findings, of which 13 patients had signs of acute hepatitis and 6 had vascular complications. Pathology was performed in 6 patients. Predominant findings were severe cholestasis and macrophage activation. CONCLUSION: For most hospitalized COVID-19 patients, elevated liver enzymes cause little concern as they are only mild to moderate. However, in severely ill patients bedside sonography is a powerful tool to reveal different patterns of vascular, cholestatic or inflammatory complications in the liver, which are associated with high mortality. In addition, macrophage activation as histopathologic correlate for a hyperinflammatory syndrome seems to be a frequent complication in COVID-19.","Spogis, Jakob; Hagen, Florian; Thaiss, Wolfgang M; Hoffmann, Tatjana; Malek, Nisar; Nikolaou, Konstantin; Berg, Christoph P; Singer, Stephan; Bösmüller, Hans; Kreth, Florian; Kaufmann, Sascha",PLoS One,,697
303513,Corporate Social Responsibility in times of Crisis: Business Actions during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Thousands of food additives are being used by the food industries in ready to eat packed food. These food additives act as either preservatives or enhancers of palatability. Monosodium glutamate (MSG), a sodium salt of glutamic acid is a widely used food additive for enhancing taste. It gives the unique taste to the food called ""Umami"" or ""Savory taste"", which is different from four primary tastes namely, sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. The current experimental study was investigated by dose-related effects of MSG on adult Wistar rats using histological and histomorphometric techniques. METHODS: Twenty-eight adult Wistar rats were divided into four groups i.e.; one control and three experimental groups. Rats were administered orally with different doses of MSG to the experimental groups and distilled water to the control groups consecutively for 45 days. At the end of the study, rats were sacrificed and tissues were collected for the examination. RESULTS: Histomorphometric data of the nuclei diameter of hepatocytes showed significant variation between control and experimental groups. Less PAS-positive material found in a higher dose of MSG-induced rats in histochemical observation. CONCLUSIONS: One of the challenges of the problem of animal experimental studies is the application of results to human dietary intake of MSG. Based on the dose-dependent findings of the current study; it is evident that the administration of MSG is hepatotoxic in adult Wistar rats.","Reddy, Anil Kumar; Ghoshal, Joy A K; Pk, Sankaran; Trivedi, Ganesh N; Ambareesha, Kondam",J. basic clin. physiol. pharmacol,,697

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of COVID-19. Subversion of host protein synthesis is a common strategy that pathogenic viruses use to replicate and propagate in their host. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to shut down host protein synthesis and that SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein NSP14 exerts this activity. We show that the translation inhibition activity of NSP14 is conserved in human coronaviruses. NSP14 is required for virus replication through contribution of its exoribonuclease (ExoN) and N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activities. Mutations in the ExoN or N7-MTase active sites of SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 abolish its translation inhibition activity. In addition, we show that the formation of NSP14-NSP10 complex enhances translation inhibition executed by NSP14. Consequently, the translational shutdown by NSP14 abolishes the type I interferon (IFN-I)-dependent induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).

305732,Short-term impacts of COVID-19 on food security and nutrition in rural Guatemala: Phone-based farm household survey evidence,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Evolving techniques in the field of therapeutic bronchoscopy have led to the return of rigid bronchoscopy in the treatment of complex central airway disease. Rigid bronchoscopy is typically performed under general anesthesia because of the strong stimulation caused by metal instruments. Anesthesia for rigid bronchoscopy is challenging to administer because anesthesiologists and interventionists share the same working channel: the airway. Previously reviewed anesthetic methods are used primarily for short procedures. Balanced anesthesia with ultrasound-guided superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) block and total intravenous anesthesia might provide anesthesia for a prolonged procedure and facilitate patient recovery. PATIENT CONCERNS: A patient with obstructed endobronchial stent was referred for therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy, which requires deeper anesthesia than flexible bronchoscopy. There were concerns of the stronger stimulation of the rigid bronchoscopy, lengthy duration of the procedure, higher risk of hypoxemia, and the difficulty of mechanical ventilation weaning after anesthesia due to the patients co-morbidities. DIAGNOSIS: A 66-year-old female patient presented with a history of breast cancer with lung metastases. Right main bronchus obstruction due to external compression of lung metastases was relieved through insertion of an endobronchial stent, but obstructive granulation developed after 4 months. Presence of the malfunctioning stent caused severe cough and discomfort. Removal of the stent by using a flexible bronchoscope was attempted twice but failed. INTERVENTIONS: Regional anesthesia of the upper airway through ultrasound-guided SLN block combined with intratracheal 2% lidocaine spray was performed to assist in total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) during rigid bronchoscopy. OUTCOMES: The patient maintained steady spontaneous breathing throughout the procedure without laryngospasm, bucking, or desaturation. Emergence from anesthesia was smooth and rapid after propofol infusion was discontinued. The surgery lasted 2.5âhours without discontinuity, and no perioperative pulmonary or cardiovascular complications were noted. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided SLN block is a simple technique with a high success rate and low complication rate. Application of SLN block to assist TIVA provides sufficient anesthesia for lengthened therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy without interruption and facilitates patient recovery.","Liao, Yu-Chen; Wu, Wei-Ciao; Hsieh, Ming-Hui; Chang, Chuen-Chau; Tsai, Hsiao-Chien",Medicine (Baltimore),,697

307380,Significant impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on urban air pollution in Kolkata (India) and amelioration of environmental health,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a recently emerged lower respiratory tract illness, has quickly become a pandemic. The purpose of this review is to discuss and differentiate COVID-19 typical imaging findings from other diseases, which can appear similar in the first instance. The typical CT findings of COVID-19 are bilateral and peripheral predominant ground glass opacities. As per the Fleischner Society consensus statement, CT is appropriate in certain scenarios, including patients who are at risk for and/or develop clinical worsening. The probability, that CT findings represent COVID-19, however, depends largely on the pre-test probability of infection, which is in turn defined by community prevalence of infection. When the community prevalence of COVID-19 is low, a large gap exists between positive predictive values of chest CT vs. RT-PCR. This implies that with usage of Chest CT there are a large number of false positive results. Imaging differentiation is important, for management and isolation purposes, and for appropriate disposition of CT false positive patients. We will discuss differential pathology with close imaging resemblance to typical CT imaging features of COVID-19, and, highlight CT features that may help in differentiation from other conditions.","Parekh, Maansi; Donuru, Achala; Balasubramanya, Rashmi; Kapur, Sangita",Radiology,,697

309404,Do loan subsidies boost the real activity of small firms?,2021,"Recently, flexible electronics have been paid great attention due to their unique characteristics, such as high stretchability, arbitrary bending, and recoverable deformation. As a core component, flexible conductive materials with skin-like properties are desirable and valuable for the development of flexible electronics. However, the integration of skin-like mechanical properties, inherent self-healing ability, ultrahigh sensitivity, and electrical conductivity into one material is difficult to be realized. Here, this study reports a kind of conductive film (PAM-dc-fGO) fabricated by cross-linking intrinsic self-repair polyazomethine (PAM) and ethylenediamine-functionalized graphene oxide (fGO) through dynamic covalent bonds (imine bonds, -CHâN-). The as-prepared conductive films exhibit skin-like mechanical properties with a stretchability of 212-275% and elastic moduli of 0.76-4.23 MPa. In addition, the healing efficiency in mechanical properties of the 24 h healed specimen can restore up to 99%, and the healing efficiency in terms of electrical conductivity still maintains above 95% after five breaking/healing cycles, indicating an excellent capability of self-repair. Due to the ultrahigh sensing sensitivity with the gauge factor (GF) of 641, the PAM-dc-fGO film-based strain sensor can precisely detect the weak signals from the human body. Moreover, the remote monitoring of human motions with a long distance of about 100 cm has been successfully conducted by a PAM-dc-fGO proximity sensor. This work provides a new path for the development of multifunctional soft materials, and the sensors show great potential in health diagnoses and security protection applications.","Du, Yuzhang; Yu, Guanxiong; Dai, Xingyi; Wang, Xudong; Yao, Bin; Kong, Jie",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,,697

In addition to infecting the respiratory system, COVID-19 also has adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. COVID-19 causes acute myocardial injuries, as well as chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. AREAS COVERED: The present review is aimed at providing current information on COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system. PubMed, Scopus, Science direct, and Google Scholar were searched. EXPERT OPINION: It is suggested that heart injury caused by COVID-19 infection might be an important cause of severe clinical phenotypes or adverse events in affected patients. Myocardial damage is closely related to the severity of the disease and even the prognosis in patients with COVID-19. In addition to disorders that are caused by COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system, more protection should be employed for patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hence, it is very important that once relevant symptoms appear, patients with COVID-19 be rapidly treated to reduce mortality. Thus, early measurements of cardiac damage via biomarkers following hospitalization for COVID-19 infections in a patient with preexisting CVD are recommended, together with careful monitoring of any myocardial injury that might be caused by the infection.

312335,A quick study on srl profiles of online learning participants during the anticipation of the spread of COVID-19,2020,"Large amounts of research efforts have been focused on learning gene regulatory networks (GRNs) based on gene expression data to understand the functional basis of a living organism. Under the assumption that the joint distribution of the gene expressions of interest is a multivariate normal distribution, such networks can be constructed by assessing the nonzero elements of the inverse covariance matrix, the so-called precision matrix or concentration matrix. This may not reflect the true connectivity between genes by considering just pairwise linear correlations. To relax this limitative constraint, we employ Gaussian process (GP) model which is well known as computationally efficient non-parametric Bayesian machine learning technique. GPs are among a class of methods known as kernel machines which can be used to approximate complex problems by tuning their hyperparameters. In fact, GP creates the ability to use the capacity and potential of different kernels in constructing precision matrix and GRNs. In this paper, in the first step, we choose the GP with appropriate kernel to learn the considered GRNs from the observed genetic data, and then we estimate kernel hyperparameters using rule-of-thumb technique. Using these hyperparameters, we can also control the degree of sparseness in the precision matrix. Then we obtain kernel-based precision matrix similar to GLASSO to construct kernel-based GRN. The findings of our research are used to construct GRNs with high performance, for different species of Drosophila fly rather than simply using the assumption of multivariate normal distribution, and the GPs, despite the use of the kernels capacity, have a much better performance than the multivariate Gaussian distribution assumption.","Chatrabgoun, H; Soltanian, A R; Mahjub, H; Bahreini, F",J Bioinform Comput Biol,,697

Many countries are still at the peak of infection. The prolonged lockdown has caused a serious impact on the socio-economy of the whole world. There is a growing concern about the link between animal’s based food product with all the contagious diseases as most of the pandemic are initiated from farming animals. The micro study of the virus or bacteria could trace the infectious pathway of the contagious diseases and find substantial problem-solving solutions. Nevertheless, the root cause of the diseases remained unknown. Because of this, it is essential to evaluate the root cause of the disease in the macro-scope of study. By discovering the designated function of all the microorganisms from the insight perspective of the Theory of Changes and other Taoism theories, we could define the effective problem-solving solution. The result of the finding has discovered that the microorganisms which bring the so called “contagious diseases” are the cure for Mother Nature to resume its equilibrium. They are the agents of decomposition and transformation of Mother Nature. Coronavirus, other viruses, and bacteria are the essential microorganisms being created by nature to decompose the excessive animals’ dead bodies that awash in the environment into smaller particles or subtracts, transforming them into useful nutrients to be absorbed and restored by Mother earth. After identifying the deadly microorganism as the cure for Mother Nature and recognizing the harm that we have done to Mother Nature, we could find out the root cause of the problem and solve the problem fundamentally. © 2021, Editorial board of Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences.

312863,Keep Your Community Safe While COVID-19 Spreads Globally,2020,"To provide a contemporary global prevalence of mental health issues among the general population amid the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We searched electronic databases, preprint databases, grey literature, and unpublished studies from January 1, 2020, to June 16, 2020 (updated on July 11, 2020), with no language restrictions. Observational studies using validated measurement tools and reporting data on mental health issues among the general population were screened to identify all relevant studies. We have included information from 32 different countries and 398,771 participants. The pooled prevalence of mental health issues amid the COVID-19 pandemic varied widely across countries and regions and was higher than previous reports before the COVID-19 outbreak began. The global prevalence estimate was 28.0% for depression; 26.9% for anxiety; 24.1% for post-traumatic stress symptoms; 36.5% for stress; 50.0% for psychological distress; and 27.6% for sleep problems. Data are limited for other aspects of mental health issues. Our findings highlight the disparities between countries in terms of the poverty impacts of COVID-19, preparedness of countries to respond, and economic vulnerabilities that impact the prevalence of mental health problems. Research on the social and economic burden is needed to better manage mental health problems during and after epidemics or pandemics.

312896,"The ground-level ozone concentration is inversely correlated with the number of COVID-19 cases in Warsaw, Poland",2021,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) is currently the most common contagious disease which is prevalent all over the world. The main challenge of this disease is the primary diagnosis to prevent secondary infections and its spread from one person to another. Therefore, it is essential to use an automatic diagnosis system along with clinical procedures for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to prevent its spread. Artificial intelligence techniques using computed tomography (CT) images of the lungs and chest radiography have the potential to obtain high diagnostic performance for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and Sobel filter is proposed to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. A new X-ray image dataset was collected and subjected to high pass filter using a Sobel filter to obtain the edges of the images. Then these images are fed to CNN deep learning model followed by SVM classifier with ten-fold cross validation strategy. This method is designed so that it can learn with not many data. Our results show that the proposed CNN-SVM with Sobel filtering (CNN-SVM+Sobel) achieved the highest classification accuracy of 99.02% in accurate detection of COVID-19. It showed that using Sobel filter can improve the performance of CNN. Unlike most of the other researches, this method does not use a pre-trained network. We have also validated our developed model using six public databases and obtained the highest performance.

314119,Himalaya air quality impacts from the COVID-19 lockdown across the Indo-Gangetic Plain,2021,"BACKGROUND: The determinants of COVID-19 disease severity and extrapulmonary complications (EPCs) are poorly understood. We characterized relationships between SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and disease severity, clinical deterioration, and specific EPCs. METHODS: We used quantitative (qPCR) and digital (dPCR) PCR to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA from plasma in 191 patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with COVID-19. We recorded patient symptoms, laboratory markers, and clinical outcomes, with a focus on oxygen requirements over time. We collected longitudinal plasma samples from a subset of patients. We characterized the role of RNAemia in predicting clinical severity and EPCs using elastic net regression. RESULTS: 23.0% (44/191) of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had viral RNA detected in plasma by dPCR, compared to 1.4% (2/147) by qPCR. Most patients with serial measurements had undetectable RNAemia within 10 days of symptom onset, reached maximum clinical severity within 16 days, and symptom resolution within 33 days. Initially RNAaemic patients were more likely to manifest severe disease (OR 6.72 [95% CI, 2.45 - 19.79]), worsening of disease severity (OR 2.43 [95% CI, 1.07 - 5.38]), and EPCs (OR 2.81 [95% CI, 1.26 - 6.36]). RNA load correlated with maximum severity (r = 0.47 [95% CI, 0.20 - 0.67]). CONCLUSIONS: dPCR is more sensitive than qPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, which is a robust predictor of eventual COVID-19 severity and oxygen requirements, as well as EPCs. Since many COVID-19 therapies are initiated on the basis of oxygen requirements, RNAemia on presentation might serve to direct early initiation of appropriate therapies for the patients most likely to deteriorate.","Ram-Mohan, Nikhil; Kim, David; Zudock, Elizabeth J; Hashemi, Marjan M; Tjandra, Kristel C; Rogers, Angela J; Blish, Catherine A; Nadeau, Kari C; Newberry, Jennifer A; Quinn, James V; O039,; Hara, Ruth; Ashley, Euan; Nguyen, Hien; Jiang, Lingxia; Hung, Paul; Blomkalns, Andra L; Yang, Samuel",Clin. infect. dis,,697

The explosive transmission of the virus in the last ten years put it in the limelight and improved our understanding of its biology and pathology. Currently, no vaccine or drugs are available to prevent or treat ZIKV infections. Knowing the potential of flaviviruses to broaden their geographic distribution, as observed for the West Nile virus, it is of importance to develop novel antiviral strategies. In this work, we identified poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSSNa) as a new polymeric ZIKV inhibitor. We demonstrated that PSSNa inhibits ZIKV replication in vitro both in animal and human cells, while no cytotoxicity is observed. Our mechanistic studies indicated that PSSNa acts mostly through direct binding to ZIKV particle and blocking its attachment to the host cells.","Botwina, Pawel; Obloza, Magdalena; Szczepanski, Artur; Szczubialka, Krzysztof; Nowakowska, Maria; Pyrc, Krzysztof",Viruses,,697

We aimed to assess the effect of sulodexide when used within 3 days of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical onset. We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled outpatient trial. To be included, patients must have been at high risk for severe clinical progression. Participants received sulodexide (oral 1,000 LRU/d) or placebo for 21 days. The primary endpoint was the need for hospital care. Also assessed were patients' need for supplemental oxygen as well as D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, thromboembolic events, major bleeding, and mortality. A total of 243 patients were included in the per-protocol analysis from June 5 to August 30, 2020. Of these, 124 received sulodexide and 119 received a placebo. Only 17.7% of the patients in the sulodexide group required hospitalization, compared with 29.4% in the placebo group (p = 0.03). This benefit persisted in the intention-to-treat analysis (15% in sulodexide group vs. 24% with placebo [p = 0.04]). With sulodexide, fewer patients required supplemental oxygen (30 vs. 42% [p = 0.05]). After 2 weeks, fewer patients had D-dimer levels >500 ng/dL (22 vs. 47% [p < 0.01]), and patients also had lower mean CRP levels (12.5 vs. 17.8 mg/dL [p < 0.01]). There were no between-group differences in thromboembolic events, major bleeding, or mortality. Treatment of COVID-19 patients with sulodexide, when provided within 3 days of clinical onset, improved their clinical outcomes. Although the results should be confirmed, sulodexide could be valuable in an outpatient setting.","Gonzalez-Ochoa, Alejandro J; Raffetto, Joseph D; Hernández, Ana G; Zavala, Nestor; Gutiérrez, Obed; Vargas, Arturo; Loustaunau, Jorge",Thromb Haemost,,697

While the spread of COVID-19 is increased, new, automatic, and reliable methods for accurate detection are essential to reduce the exposure of the medical experts to the outbreak. X-ray imaging, although limited to specific visualizations, may be helpful for the diagnosis. Deep Learning has proven to be a remarkable method to extract massive high-dimensional features from medical images. Specifically, in this paper, the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to investigate the importance of the extracted features for the classification task. A large-scale dataset of 3905 X-Ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve remarkable results in related tasks. The results suggest that training CNNs from scratch may reveal vital biomarkers related but not limited to the COVID-19 disease, while an overall classification accuracy of the seven classes reaches 87.66%. Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID-19.","Apostolopoulos, Ioannis; Aznaouridis, Sokratis; Tzani, Mpesiana",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00338v1.pdf,697

Similar results followed exposure of IL-6 to N-chlorotaurine (NCT) and hypobromous acid (HOBr). SDS-PAGE analysis of HOCl-treated IL-6 showed neither fragmentation nor aggregation, suggesting that the modifications induced by these agents occurred on the intact protein. Mass spectrometry of intact and trypsin-digested fragments identified oxidative changes limited to two amino acid residues, methionine 161 and tryptophan 157, both of which have been implicated in receptor binding of the cytokine.

We aim to report outcomes for children with LD and LT enrolled in the NASPGHAN/SPLIT SARS-CoV2 registry. METHODS: In this multicenter observational cohort study, we collected data from 91 patients <21âyears (LD 44, LT 47) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection between April 21 and September 17, 2020. RESULTS: Patients with LD were more likely to require admission (70% vs 43% LT, pâ=â0.007) and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) management (32% vs 4% LT, pâ=â0.001). Seven LD patients required mechanical ventilation (MV) and 2 patients died; no patients in the LT cohort died or required MV. Four LD patients presented in pediatric acute liver failure (PALF), 2 with concurrent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); all recovered without LT. Two LD patients had MIS-C alone and one patient died.

In radiology, much of the literature to date has focused on chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 (Zhou et al. [1]; Chung et al. [2]). However, due to infection control issues related to patient transport to CT suites, the inefficiencies introduced in CT room decontamination, and lack of CT availability in parts of the world, portable chest radiography (CXR) will likely be the most commonly utilized modality for identification and follow up of lung abnormalities. In fact, the American College of Radiology (ACR) notes that CT decontamination required after scanning COVID-19 patients may disrupt radiological service availability and suggests that portable chest radiography may be considered to minimize the risk of cross-infection (American College of Radiology [3]). Furthermore, in cases of high clinical suspicion for COVID-19, a positive CXR may obviate the need for CT. Additionally, CXR utilization for early disease detection may also play a vital role in areas around the world with limited access to reliable real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID testing.

323351,Women in higher education: A brief report on stress during COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe public health problem globally. Both epidemiological and laboratory studies have shown that ambient temperature could affect the transmission and survival of coronaviruses. This study aimed to determine whether the temperature is an essential factor in the infection caused by this novel coronavirus. METHODS: Daily confirmed cases and meteorological factors in 122 cities were collected between January 23, 2020, to February 29, 2020. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the nonlinear relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases. We also used a piecewise linear regression to determine the relationship in detail. RESULTS: The exposure-response curves suggested that the relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases was approximately linear in the range of <3 °C and became flat above 3 °C. When mean temperature (lag0-14) was below 3 °C, each 1 °C rise was associated with a 4.861% (95% CI: 3.209-6.513) increase in the daily number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. These findings were robust in our sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mean temperature has a positive linear relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases with a threshold of 3 °C.

We tracked the impacts of COVID-19 and associated policy responses on the availability and price of aquatic foods and production inputs during 2020, using a high frequency longitudinal survey of 768 respondents in Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Myanmar, Nigeria. We found the following: (1) Aquatic food value chains were severely disrupted but most effects on the availability and accessibility of aquatic foods and production inputs were short-lived. (2) Impacts on demand for aquatic foods, production inputs, and labor have been longer lasting than impacts on their supply. (3) Retail prices of aquatic foods spiked briefly during March-May 2020 but trended down thereafter, whereas prices of production inputs rose. These trends suggest a deepening ‘squeeze’ on the financial viability of producers and other value chain actors. (4) Survey respondents adapted to the challenges of COVID-19 by reducing production costs, sourcing alternative inputs, diversifying business activities, leveraging social capital, borrowing, seeking alternative employment, and reducing food consumption. Many of these coping strategies are likely to undermine well-being and longer-term resilience, but we also find some evidence of proactive strategies with potential to strengthen business performance.

Workforce reorganization, reduced standard of care and a lack of personal protection equipment (PPE) for health care workers were among the concerns raised in the first wave of the pandemic. Our aim was to explore the experiences, distress and burden among Norwegian neurologists during the first weeks of the pandemic. METHODS: Hospital-based neurologists in Norway (n = 400) were invited to a web-based survey in April 2020. The study focused on patient management, organizational changes and personal stress during the first weeks of the pandemic lockdown. Work-home interface stress was assessed by the Cooper Job Stress Questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 135 neurologists participated. Seventy-three% experienced a change in their personal work situation, and 67% examined patients with suspected COVID-19 infection and neurological disease. Changed access to resources, and the perception that medical follow-up was unsatisfactory, were associated with a high degree of burden and stress. Neurologists were also worried about the potential lack of PPE and the fear of spreading SARS CoV-2 to close family members. The mean score of work-home interface stress was 2.8 with no significant differences between gender or specialist status. Reduced standard of care was reported for all neurological conditions, and in particular for non-emergency treatments. CONCLUSION: The vast majority of neurologists in Norway experienced a change in their personal work situation during the first phase of the pandemic.

325375,The impact of COVID-19 on the housing market: evidence from the Yangtze river delta region in China,2021,"BACKGROUND: The effects of an early and prolonged lockdown during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on cardiovascular intensive care units (CICUs) are not well established. OBJECTIVES: This study analyses patterns of admission, mortality and performance indicators in a CICU before and during the Argentine lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational cross-sectional study of all consecutive patients aged 18 years or more admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit at a high-volume reference hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina, comparing hospitalization rates, primary causes of admission, inpatient utilization indicators, pharmacy supplies' expenditures and in-hospital mortality between 5 March and 31 July 2020, with two corresponding control periods in 2019 and 2018. RESULTS: We included 722 female patients [mean age of 61.6 (SD 15.5) years; 237 (32.8%)]. Overall hospitalizations dropped 53.2% (95%CI: 45.3, 61.0%), from 295.5 patients/year over the periods 2018/2019 to 137 patients in 2020. Cardiovascular disease-related admissions dropped 59.9%, while admission for non-cardiac causes doubled its prevalence from 9.6% over the periods 2018/2019 to 22.6% in the study period (P < 0.001).In the period 2020, the bed occupancy rate fell from 82.2% to 77.4%, and the bed turnover rate dropped 50% from 7.88 to 3.91 monthly discharges/bed. The average length of stay doubled from 3.26 to 6.75 days, and the turnover interval increased from 3.8 to 8.39 days in 2020.Pharmacy supplies' expenditures per discharge increased 134% along with a rise in antibiotics usage from 6.5 to 11.4 vials/ampoules per discharge (P < 0.02).Overall mortality increased from 7% (n = 41) to 13.9% (n = 19) (P = 0.008) at the expense of non-cardiac-related admissions (3.6-19.4%, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study found a significant reduction in overall and cardiovascular disease-related causes of admission to the cardiac intensive care unit, worse performance indicators and increased in-hospital mortality along the first 5 months of the early and long-lasting COVID-19 lockdown in Argentina. These results highlight the need to foster public awareness concerning the risks of avoiding hospital attendance. Moreover, health systems should follow strict screening protocols to prevent potential biases in the admission of patients with critical conditions unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Szarfer, Jorge Luis; Puente, Luciana; Bono, Leandro; Estrella, María Laura; Doppler, Eugenia; Napoli Llobera, Mariano; Arce, María Patricia; Borri, Karina Alejandra; Fiandesio, Mariana Elisa; Ferraris, Marta Josefina; Gagliardi, Juan",Int. j. qual. health care,,697

In absence of effective therapy to manage COVID-19, repurposed therapies were being used to manage the condition. In view of an urgent need for definitive therapy, multiple repurposed drugs, and investigational drug candidates are being tried in clinical trials which may lead to the emergence of unknown short term and long term adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and hence it is crucial to assess the safety of the tried therapeutic interventions. The lag in the pharmacovigilance activities in the midst of this pandemic fosters under-reporting of ADRs. Difficulty in causality assessment due to factors like wide variations in clinical presentation, concomitant use of multiple drugs, associated comorbidities, drug-drug and drug-disease interaction which forestalls the appropriate causality assessment. Hydroxychloroquine, a repurposed antimalarial drug has been a part of hue and cry at present because of its in-question safety in patients with cardiac disorders. National and International Drug monitoring centers have stressed upon reporting of ADRs and to boost up the process and come up with various recommendations. We can overcome these issues by working cohesively, motivating HCPs and patients to report ADRs electronically, and by setting up dedicated pharmacovigilance rapid response team to tackle the issues at the earliest.","Dutta, S.; Ambwani, S.; Mishra, G.; Lal, H.; Ram, K.; Kumar, T.",International Journal of Applied Pharmaceutics,,697

Typically, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) caused SARS pandemic in 2003 and SARS-CoV-2 caused the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Both viruses are most likely originated from bats. Thus, direct or indirect inter-species transmission from bats to humans is required for the viruses to cause pandemics. Receptor utilization is a key factor determining the host range of viruses which is critical to the inter-species transmission. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of certain animals can be utilized by the viruses. Here, we employed pseudovirus cell-entry assay to evaluate the receptor-utilizing capability of ACE2s of 20 animals by the two viruses and found that SARS-CoV-2 utilized less ACE2s than SARS-CoV, indicating a narrower host range of SARS-CoV-2. Especially, SARS-CoV-2 tended not to use murine or non-mammal ACE2s. Meanwhile, pangolin-CoV, another SARS-related coronavirus highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 in its genome, yet showed similar ACE2 utilization profile with SARS-CoV rather than SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, the actual susceptibility of these animals to the coronaviruses should be further verified by in vivo studies. To clarify the mechanism underlying the receptor utilization, we compared the amino acid sequences of the 20 ACE2s and found 5 amino acid residues potentially critical for ACE2 utilization, including the N-terminal 20th and 42nd amino acid residues that might determine the different receptor utilization of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-CoV. Our studies enhance the understanding of receptor utilization of pandemic coronaviruses, potentially contributing to the virus tracing, intermediate host screening and epidemic prevention for pathogenic coronaviruses.","Wang, Qiong; Qiu, Ye; Li, Jin-Yan; Liao, Ce-Heng; Zhou, Zhi-Jian; Ge, Xing-Yi",Transbound. emerg. dis.

329191,Psychological Description Of Students In The Learning Process During Pandemic COVID-19,2020,"Given the current scarcity of curative treatment of COVID-19, the search for an effective treatment modality among all available medications has become a priority. This study aimed at investigating the role of functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMAs) on in-hospital COVID-19 mortality. In this retrospective cohort study, we included adult in-patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 with definite outcomes (discharged hospital or deceased) from Erasme Hospital (Brussels, Belgium). We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. We included 350 patients (205 males, 145 females) with a mean age of 63.24 years (SD = 17.4, range: 21-96 years). Seventy-two patients died in the hospital and 278 were discharged. The four most common comorbidities were hypertension (184, 52.6%), chronic cardiac disease (110, 31.4%), obesity (96, 27.8%) and diabetes (95, 27.1%). Ninety-three participants (26.6%) received a long-term prescription for FIASMAs. Among these, 60 (64.5%) received amlodipine. For FIASMAs status, multivariable regression showed increasing odds ratio (OR) for in-hospital deaths associated with older age (OR 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.07; p = 0.00015), and higher prevalence of malignant neoplasm (OR 2.09, 95% CI: 1.03-4.22; p = 0.039). Nonsignificant decreasing OR (0.53, 95% CI: 0.27-1.04; p = 0.064) was reported for FIASMA status. For amlodipine status, multivariable regression revealed increasing OR of in-hospital deaths associated with older age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02-1.07; p = 0.0009), higher prevalence of hypertension (OR 2.78, 95% CI: 1.33-5.79; p = 0.0062) and higher prevalence of malignant neoplasm (OR 2.71, 95% CI: 1.23-5.97; p = 0.013), then secondarily decreasing OR of in-hospital death associated with long-term treatment with amlodipine (OR 0.24, 95% CI: 0.09-0.62; p = 0.0031). Chronic treatment with amlodipine could be significantly associated with low mortality of COVID-19 in-patients.","Darquennes, Gil; Le Corre, Pascal; Le Moine, Olivier; Loas, Gwenolé",,,697

332609,Assessing dairy supply chain vulnerability during the Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"Background: Periodically, humanity is often faced with new and emerging viruses that can be a significant global threat. It has already been over a century post-the Spanish Flu pandemic, and we are witnessing a new type of coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for Covid-19. It emerged from the city of Wuhan (China) in December 2019, and within a few months, the virus propagated itself globally now resulting more than 50 million cases with over 1 million deaths. The high infection rates coupled with dynamic population movement demands for tools, especially within a Brazilian context, that will support health managers to develop policies for controlling and combating the new virus. Methods: In this work, we propose a tool for real-time spatio-temporal analysis using a machine learning approach. The COVID-SGIS system brings together routinely collected health data on Covid-19 distributed across public health systems in Brazil, as well as taking to under consideration the geographic and time-dependent features of Covid-19 so as to make spatio-temporal predictions. The data are sub-divided by federative unit and municipality. In our case study, we made spatio-temporal predictions of the distribution of cases and deaths in Brazil and in each federative unit. Four regression methods were investigated: linear regression, support vector machines (polynomial kernels and RBF), multilayer perceptrons, and random forests. We use the percentage RMSE and the correlation coefficient as quality metrics. Results: For qualitative evaluation, we made spatio-temporal predictions for the period from 25 to 27 May 2020. Considering qualitatively and quantitatively the case of the State of Pernambuco and Brazil as a whole, linear regression presented the best prediction results (thematic maps with good data distribution, correlation coefficient >0.99 and RMSE (%) <4% for Pernambuco and around 5% for Brazil) with low training time: [0.00; 0.04 ms], CI 95%. Conclusion: Spatio-temporal analysis provided a broader assessment of those in the regions where the accumulated confirmed cases of Covid-19 were concentrated. It was possible to differentiate in the thematic maps the regions with the highest concentration of cases from the regions with low concentration and regions in the transition range. This approach is fundamental to support health managers and epidemiologists to elaborate policies and plans to control the Covid-19 pandemics.","da Silva, Cecilia Cordeiro; de Lima, Clarisse Lins; da Silva, Ana Clara Gomes; Silva, Eduardo Luiz; Marques, Gabriel Souza; de Araújo, Lucas Job Brito; Albuquerque Júnior, Luiz Antônio; de Souza, Samuel Barbosa Jatobá; de Santana, Maíra Araújo; Gomes, Juliana Carneiro; Barbosa, Valter Augusto de Freitas; Musah, Anwar; Kostkova, Patty; Dos Santos, Wellington Pinheiro; da Silva Filho, Abel Guilhermino",Front Public Health,,697

334013,Covid-19 Lockdown Challenges or New Era for Higher Education,2021,"ObjectivesTo investigate the association of primary acute cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) with COVID-19 vaccination through complete ascertainment of all diagnosed CVT in the population of Scotland. DesignCase-crossover study comparing recent (1-14 days after vaccination) with less recent exposure to vaccination among cases of CVT. SettingNational data for Scotland from 1 December 2020, with diagnosed CVT case ascertainment through neuroimaging studies up to 17 May 2021 and diagnostic coding of hospital discharges up to 28 April 2021 and with linkage to vaccination records. Main outcome measurePrimary acute cerebral venous thrombosis ResultsOf 50 primary acute CVT cases, 29 were ascertained only from neuroimaging studies, 2 were ascertained only from hospital discharges, and 19 were ascertained from both sources. Of these 50 cases, 14 had received the Astra-Zeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine and 3 the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. The incidence of CVT per million doses in the first 14 days after vaccination was 2.2 (95% credible interval 0.9 to 4.1) for ChAdOx1 and 1 (95% credible interval 0.1 to 2.9) for BNT162b2. The rate ratio for CVT associated with exposure to ChAdOx1 in the first 14 days compared with exposure 15-84 days after vaccination was 3.2 (95% credible interval 1.1 to 9.5). The 95% credible interval for the rate ratio associated with recent versus less recent exposure to BNT162b2 (0.6 to 95.8) was too wide for useful inference. ConclusionsThese findings support a causal association between CVT and the AstraZeneca vaccine. The absolute risk of post-vaccination CVT in this population-wide study in Scotland was lower than has been reported for populations in Scandinavia and Germany; the explanation for this is not clear. What is already known on this topicThe risk of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) within 28 days of receiving the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine has been estimated as 18 to 25 per million doses in Germany and Scandinavia, but only 5 per million doses in the UK based on the Yellow Card reporting scheme. Risk estimates based on adverse event reporting systems are subject to under-ascertainment and other biases. What this study addsAll diagnosed cases of CVT in Scotland were ascertained by searching neuroimaging studies from December 2020 to May 2021 and linked to national vaccination records. The risk of CVT within 28 days of vaccination with ChAdOx1 was estimated as 3.5 per million doses with an upper bound of 6 per million doses, against a background incidence of about 12 per million adults per year. This indicates that the Yellow Card system has not seriously underestimated the risk in the UK; the explanation for higher risk in other European countries is not clear.","McKeigue, Paul M; Burgul, Raj; Bishop, Jennifer; Robertson, Chris; McMenamin, Jim; O'Leary, Maureen; McAllister, David A.; Colhoun, Helen M",,,697

We report the events, workup, and eventual second dose vaccination of a patient at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, who had immediate anaphylaxis after administration of the first Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 (BNT162b2) vaccine dose. During the initial evaluation after anaphylaxis, the patient described a history of symptoms suspicious for cholinergic urticaria but had never had this condition confirmed with standardized testing. After the episode of anaphylaxis, we performed several studies including immediate hypersensitivity skin testing, which did not demonstrate vaccine or component sensitization. We then performed an exercise provocation challenge and confirmed the diagnosis of cholinergic urticaria. These results, combined with the patient history, suggested that the episode of anaphylaxis was most likely driven by a severe flare of cholinergic urticaria. After obtaining the patient's consent, she received and tolerated her second dose without any objective findings of anaphylaxis. We conclude that patients with mast cell disorders or anaphylaxis after their first Covid-19 immunization will benefit from referral to an allergist since receipt of their second Covid-19 immunization may be possible.","Park, Hyun J; Montgomery, Jay R; Boggs, Nathan A",Mil. med,,697

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 677 patients. Two nasopharyngeal swabs and 1 oropharyngeal swab were collected from patients. The RDT was performed onsite by a commercially available immune-chromatographic assay on the nasopharyngeal swab. The nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were examined for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RDT was 34.5% and the specificity was 99.8%. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the test were 96.6% and 91.5%, respectively. The detection rate of RDT in RT-qPCR positive results was high (45%) for cycle threshold values &lt;25. CONCLUSION: The utility of RDT is in diagnosing symptomatic patients and may not be particularly suited as a screening tool for patients with low viral load. The low sensitivity of RDT does not qualify its use as a single test in patients who test negative;RT-qPCR continues to be the gold standard test.","Thakur, P.; Saxena, S.; Manchanda, V.; Rana, N.; Goel, R.; Arora, R.",Laboratory Medicine,,697
337442,Covid-19 induced transition from classroom to online mid semester: Case study on faculty and students’ preferences and opinions,2020,"BACKGROUND: Serologic assays for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have roles in seroepidemiology, convalescent plasma-testing, antibody durability and vaccine studies. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 serology is performed using serum/plasma collected by venepuncture. Dried bloodspot (DBS) testing offers significant advantages; as it is minimally invasive, avoids venepuncture with specimens being mailed to the laboratory. METHODS: A pathway utilising a newborn screening laboratory infrastructure was developed using an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in DBS specimens. Paired plasma and DBS specimens from SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive and negative subjects and PCR positive subjects were tested. DBS specimen stability, effect of blood volume and punch location were also evaluated. RESULTS: DBS from antibody-negative (n=85) and positive (n=35) subjects and PCR positive subjects (n=11) had a mean (SD; range) optical density (OD) of 0.14 (0.046; 0.03-0.27), 0.98 (0.41; 0.31-1.64) and 1.12 (0.37; 0.49-1.54), respectively. An action value OD >0.28 correctly assigned all cases. The weighted Deming regression for comparison of the DBS and the plasma assay yielded: y=0.004041+1.005x, r=0.991, Sy/x 0.171, n=82. Extraction efficiency of antibodies from DBS was >99%. DBS were stable for at least 28 days at ambient room temperature and humidity. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG RBD antibodies can be reliably detected in DBS. DBS serological testing offers lower costs than either point of care or serum/plasma assays that require patient travel, phlebotomy and hospital/clinic resources; the development of a DBS assay may be particularly important for resource poor settings.","Moat, Stuart James; Zelek, Wiola M; Carne, Emily; Ponsford, Mark J; Bramhall, Kathyryn; Jones, Sara; El-Shanawany, Tariq; Wise, Matthew J; Thomas, Annette; George, Chloe; Fegan, Christopher; Steven, Rachael; Webb, Russell; Weeks, Ian; Morgan, Brian Paul; Jolles, Stephen",Ann Clin Biochem,,697
337795,Balancing the Disruptions to the Teaching and Learning Equilibrium-Responsive Pedagogic Approaches to Teaching Online During the Covid-19 Pandemic in General Chemistry Classes at an Arabian Gulf University,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infectious disease, responsible for a global pandemic that began in January 2020. Human/COVID-19 interactions cause different outcomes ranging from minor health consequences to death. Since social interaction is the default mode by which individuals communicate with their surroundings, different modes of contagion can play a role in determining the long-term consequences for mental health and emotional well-being. We examined some basic aspects of human social interaction, emphasizing some particular features of the emotional contagion. Moreover, we analyzed the main report that described brain damage related to the COVID-19 infection. Indeed, the goal of this review is to suggest a possible explanation for the relationships among emotionally impaired people, brain damage, and COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: COVID-19 can cause several significant neurological disorders and the pandemic has been linked to a rise in people reporting mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety. Neurocognitive symptoms associated with COVID-19 include delirium, both acute and chronic attention and memory impairment related to hippocampal and cortical damage, as well as learning deficits in both adults and children. CONCLUSIONS: Although our knowledge on the biology and long-term clinical outcomes of the COVID-19 infection is largely limited, approaching the pandemic based on lessons learnt from previous outbreaks of infectious diseases and the biology of other coronaviruses will provide a suitable pathway for developing public mental health strategies, which could be positively translated into therapeutic approaches, attempting to improve stress coping responses, thus contributing to alleviate the burden driven by the pandemic.","Valenzano, Anna; Scarinci, Alessia; Monda, Vincenzo; Sessa, Francesco; Messina, Antonietta; Monda, Marcellino; Precenzano, Francesco; Mollica, Maria Pina; Carotenuto, Marco; Messina, Giovanni; Cibelli, Giuseppe",Medicina (Kaunas),,697
337808,Operations Management teaching practices and information technologies adoption in emerging economies during COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"Childhood cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are on the rise as the pandemic continues to rage across the globe. Most children acquire infection from an adult household member. Children may stay asymptomatic, have a pre-symptomatic stage, or present with symptoms (fever, cough, and difficulty breathing being the most common). Nearly one-third of the pediatric cases (32%) in the United States occurred in children age 15 to 17 years. Children are also at risk of a postinfectious hyperinflammatory syndrome called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The risk of vertical transmission is low (2%) in newborns of mothers with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the gold standard for (SARS-CoV-2). Serology should be considered in a child with high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 when NAAT is negative and at least 2 weeks have passed since symptom onset and for assessment of MIS-C. Easy fatigability after COVID-19 infection is reported in adults; however, data in children are lacking. Implementation of early and robust containment strategies coupled with universal COVID-19 vaccination are vital to halt the spread.

Study of PML-type JCPyV in vitro has been limited due to difficulty in efficient propagation of the virus in cultured cells. In this study, we carried out long term cultivation of COS-7 cells (designated as COS-IMRb cells) transfected with PML type M1-IMRb, an adapted viral DNA with a rearranged non-coding control region (NCCR). The JCPyV derived from COS-IMRb cells was characterized by analyzing viral replication, amount of virus by hemagglutination (HA), production of viral protein 1 (VP1), and structure of the NCCR. HA assays indicated that a high amount of PML type JCPyV was present in COS-IMRb cells. Immunostaining showed that VP1-positive cells were a small population in COS-IMRb cells that represented a JCPyV carrier cell culture. Sequencing analysis of the NCCR of JCPyV after long-term cultivation showed that the NCCR of M1-IMRb was conserved in COS-IMRb cells without any point mutation. The JCPyV genomic DNA derived from a clone of COS-IMRb-3 cells was detected by Southern blotting as a single band of approximately 5.1 kbp without deletion. These findings support that COS-IMRb-3 cells may offer a useful tool for screening anti-JCPyV drugs.","Nukuzuma, Souichi; Nukuzuma, Chiyoko; Kameoka, Masanori; Sugiura, Shigeki; Nakamichi, Kazuo; Tasaki, Takafumi; Hidaka, Koushi; Takegami, Tsutomu",Jpn. j. infect. dis,,697
340314,"Optimizing Synchronous Online Teaching Sessions: A Guide to the ""New Normal"" in Medical Education",2021,"The microbial populations in the gut microbiome have recently been associated with COVID-19 disease severity. However, a causal impact of the gut microbiome on COVID-19 patient health has not been established. Here we provide evidence that gut microbiome dysbiosis is associated with translocation of bacteria into the blood during COVID-19, causing life-threatening secondary infections. Antibiotics and other treatments during COVID-19 can potentially confound microbiome associations. We therefore first demonstrate that the gut microbiome is directly affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dose-dependent manner in a mouse model, causally linking viral infection and gut microbiome dysbiosis. Comparison with stool samples collected from 101 COVID-19 patients at two different clinical sites also revealed substantial gut microbiome dysbiosis, paralleling our observations in the animal model. Specifically, we observed blooms of opportunistic pathogenic bacterial genera known to include antimicrobial-resistant species in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Analysis of blood culture results testing for secondary microbial bloodstream infections with paired microbiome data obtained from these patients suggest that bacteria translocate from the gut into the systemic circulation of COVID-19 patients. These results are consistent with a direct role for gut microbiome dysbiosis in enabling dangerous secondary infections during COVID-19.","Venzon, Mericien; Bernard-Raichon, Lucie; Klein, Jon; Axelrad, Jordan E.; Hussey, Grant A.; Sullivan, Alexis P.; Cassanovas-Massana, Arnau; Noval, Maria G.; Valero-Jimenez, Ana M.; Gago, Juan; Wilder, Evan; Team, - Yale IMPACT Research; Thorpe, Lorna E.; Littman, Dan R.; Dittmann, Meike; Stapleford, Kenneth A.; Shopsin, Bo; Torres, Victor J.; Ko, Albert I.; Iwasaki, Akiko; Cadwell, Ken; Schluter, Jonas",,,697

Of the 891 cases, 582 were severe or critical, including 423(73%)severe and 159 (27%) critical cases. We compared the demographics, laboratory findings, clinical characteristics, treatments and prognosis data of the 582 severe patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the risk factors associated with death in COVID-19 patients. Results: The 582 severe patients included 293 males and 289 females, with a median age of 64(range 24 to 106). Sixty-three patients died, including 45 males and 18 females, with a median age of 71(range 37 to 90). The average onset time of the 582 patients was 8 days, of whom 461 (79%) had fever, 358 (62%) dry cough, 274 (47%) fatigue. There were 206 cases with shortness of breath (35%), 155 cases with expectoration (27%), 83 cases with muscle pain or joint pain (14%), 71 cases with diarrhea (12%), and 29 cases with headache (4%). Underlying diseases were present in 267 (46%) patients, most commonly hypertension (194, 33%), followed by diabetes (69, 12%), coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (37, 6%), tumor (18, 3%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5, 1%). Chest CT showed bilateral lung involvement in 505 patients (87%). Upon admission, the median lymphocyte count of the 582 patients was 0.8(IQR, 0.6-1.1)×10(9)/L, the median D-dimer was 0.5 (IQR, 0.4- 0.8) mg/L, the median N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide precursor (NT-proBNP) was 433 (IQR, 141- 806) pg/L, and the median creatinine was 70.3 (IQR, 56.9-87.9) µmol/L. The death group had a median lymphocyte count of 0.5 (0.4-0.8)×10(9)/L, D-dimer 1.1 (0.7-10.0)mg/L, N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide precursor 1479(893-5 087) pg/ml, and creatinine 89.9(67.1-125.3) µmol/L. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that increased D-dimer (OR: 1.095, 95% CI: 1.045-1.148, P<0.001), increased NT-proBNP (OR: 4.759, 95% CI: 2.437-9.291, P<0.001), and decreased lymphocyte count (OR: 0.180, 95% CI: 0.059-0.550, P=0.003) were the risk factors of death in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: The average onset time of severe COVID-19 was 8 days, and the most common symptoms were fever, dry cough and fatigue.

To investigate the ecotoxicity of epoxiconazole to soil microbiome, we carried out an indoor experiment in which soils from two main regions of wheat production in China (Nanjing and Anyang) were treated with epoxiconazole (0, 0.0625, 0.625, or 6.25 mg kg-1) and incubated for 90 days. Under epoxiconazole stress, for bacteria and fungi, the abundance was increased and the diversity and community were impacted. In Anyang soil, the half-life of epoxiconazole was short with more increased species (linear discriminant analysis effect size biomarkers) and more increased xenobiotics biodegradation pathways in epoxiconazole treatments. The increased species mostly due to high abundance in initial state and more positive connections of the species. Co-occurrences revealed that epoxiconazole tightened bacterial connection, and increased positive correlations in Anyang soil. The N transformation was influenced with increased nifH and amoA; and the contents of NH4+-N and NO3--N were also increased. The functions of C, S, and manganese metabolisms were also impacted by epoxiconazole.

Diabetics are at increased risk of infections caused by a variety of pathogens including viruses. The present research aims to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with diabetes. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study of COVID-19 patients with diabetes was conducted in four hospitals in Wuhan, Shanghai, and Anhui Province. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or next-generation sequencing was carried out to confirm the existence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from respiratory specimens. RESULTS: A total of 54 diabetics (10.36%) were recruited from among 521 COVID-19 patients, with a median age of 63 (interquartile range, 52-70) years. Among them, 51 had been previously diagnosed with diabetes and 3 had been newly diagnosed based on glycosylated hemoglobin over 6.5%. For COVID-19, 47 of the 54 patients had an exposure history. Fever (47/54, 87.04%), dry cough (36/54, 66.67%), and expectoration (21/53, 39.62%) were among the top three symptoms. Lung infiltration was bilateral (46/52, 88.46%) and multilobe (47/52, 90.38%), and ground-glass opacity (36/37, 97.30%) was the most common pattern in radiological images.

While the wild source of SARS-CoV-2 may be disputed, for MERS-CoV, dromedaries are considered as source of zoonotic human infections. Testing 100 immune-response genes in 121 dromedaries from United Arab Emirates (UAE) for potential association with present MERS-CoV infection, we identified candidate genes with important functions in the adaptive, MHC-class I (HLA-A-24-like) and II (HLA-DPB1-like), and innate immune response (PTPN4, MAGOHB), and in cilia coating the respiratory tract (DNAH7). Some of these genes previously have been associated with viral replication in SARS-CoV-1/-2 in humans, others have an important role in the movement of bronchial cilia. These results suggest similar host genetic pathways associated with these betacoronaviruses, although further work is required to better understand the MERS-CoV disease dynamics in both dromedaries and humans.","Lado, Sara; Elbers, Jean P; Plasil, Martin; Loney, Tom; Weidinger, Pia; Camp, Jeremy V; Kolodziejek, Jolanta; Futas, Jan; Kannan, Dafalla A; Orozco-terWengel, Pablo; Horin, Petr; Nowotny, Norbert; Burger, Pamela A",,,697

342491,Open Book Examination and Higher Education During COVID-19: Case of University of Delhi,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Besides prominent respiratory involvement, gastrointestinal manifestations are commonly reported in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We compared infection of ex vivo human intestinal tissues by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with respect to their replication kinetics and immune activation profile. METHODS: Human intestinal tissues were obtained from patients while undergoing surgical operations at the Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. Upon surgical removal, the tissues were immediately processed and infected with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV. Replication kinetics were determined with immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and plaque assays. Immune activation in the infected intestinal tissues was assessed by detecting the gene expression of interferons and representative pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 could infect and productively replicate in the ex vivo human intestinal tissues with the release of infectious virus particles, but not in ex vivo human liver and kidney tissues. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 replicated less efficiently than SARS-CoV, induced less cytopathology in the human intestinal epithelium, and induced a more robust innate immune response including the activation of both type I and type III interferons, than SARS-CoV in human intestinal tissues. CONCLUSION: Using the ex vivo human intestinal tissues as a physiologically relevant model, our data indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could productively replicate in the human guts, suggesting the gastrointestinal tract might serve as an alternative route of virus dissemination. SARS-CoV-2 replicated less efficiently and induced less cytopathology than SARS-CoV in keeping with the clinical observations reported for SARS-2003 and COVID-19, which might be a result of the more robust immune activation by SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV in the human intestine.","Chu, Hin; Fuk-Woo Chan, Jasper; Wang, Yixin; Tsz-Tai Yuen, Terrence; Chai, Yue; Shuai, Huiping; Yang, Dong; Hu, Bingjie; Huang, Xiner; Zhang, Xi; Hou, Yuxin; Cai, Jian-Piao; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Zhou, Jie; Yuan, Shuofeng; Kai-Wang To, Kelvin; Fan-Ngai Hung, Ivan; Cheung, Tan To; Tsui-Lin Ng, Ada; Hau-Yee Chan, Ivy; Yu-Hong Wong, Ian; Ying-Kit Law, Simon; Chi-Chung Foo, Dominic; Leung, Wai-Keung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Cell Mol.

ARDS is one of the most significant causes of death in patients with COVID-19. The development of a ""cytokine storm"" in patients with COVID-19 causes progression to ARDS. In this scoping review, we investigated the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines in inducing moderate and severe ARDS outcomes. A comprehensive search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar to implement a broad query that captured all the relevant studies published between December 2019 and September 2020.We identified seven studies that evaluated the immune response in COVID-19 patients with ARDS. The white blood cell counts (WBCs), CRP, and IL-6 were higher in the moderately presenting ARDS patients, critically ill patients, and those with more severe ARDS.

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19, has proved to be a great challenge for its ability to spread in asymptomatic stages and the diverse disease spectrum it has generated. This has created a challenge of unimaginable magnitude, not only affecting human health and life but also potentially generating a long-lasting socioeconomic impact. Both medical sciences and biomedical research have also been challenged, consequently leading to a large number of clinical trials and vaccine initiatives. While known proteins of pathobiological importance are targets for these therapeutic approaches, it is imperative to explore other factors of viral significance. Accessory proteins are one such trait that have diverse roles in coronavirus pathobiology. Here, we analyze certain genomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein ORF8 and predict its protein features. We have further reviewed current available literature regarding its function and comparatively evaluated these and other features of ORF8 and ORF8ab, its homolog from SARS-CoV. Because coronaviruses have been infecting humans repeatedly and might continue to do so, we therefore expect this study to aid in the development of holistic understanding of these proteins. Despite low nucleotide and protein identity and differentiating genome level characteristics, there appears to be significant structural integrity and functional proximity between these proteins pointing towards their high significance. There is further need for comprehensive genomics and structural-functional studies to lead towards definitive conclusions regarding their criticality and that can eventually define their relevance to therapeutics development.","Mohammad, Sameer; Bouchama, Abderrezak; Mohammad Alharbi, Bothina; Rashid, Mamoon; Saleem Khatlani, Tanveer; Gaber, Nusaibah S; Malik, Shuja Shafi",,,697

Sero-surveillance among HCWs using IgG antibodies can add further value to the scientific findings. Objectives: To estimate seropositivity among HCWs and to correlate it with various factors affecting seropositivity. Methods: Population based large scale sero-surveillance among HCWs was carried out during second half of August'20 in Ahmedabad using ""Covid-Kavach"" IgG Antibody Detection ELISA kits. Seropositivity among HCWs was estimated and compared with various demographic & other factors to understand their infection & immunity status. Proportions and Z-test were used as appropriate. Results: As on August'20, Seropositivity among HCWs from Ahmedabad is 23.65% (95% Confidence Interval 21.70-25.73%). Seropositivity of 25.98% (95%CI 23.47-28.66) among female HCWs is significantly higher than 19.48% (95%CI 16.53-22.80) among male HCWs. The zone wise positivity among HCWs closely correlate with cases reported from the respective zone. The sero-positivity among HCWs from the earliest and worst affected zones have lower level of seropositivity as compared to the zones affected recently. This might be pointing towards the fact that the IgG Antibodies may not be long lasting. Conclusion: As on August 2020, the seropositivity of 23.65% in HCWs indicate high level of disease transmission and higher risk of infection among HCWs in Ahmedabad. The seropositivity is significantly higher among female HCWs. Zone wise seropositivity, closely correlate with the reported cases from the respective zone. Their comparison also indicates the possibility of reducing IgG seropositivity, which necessitates further in-depth scientific research to generate greater scientific evidences.","Prakash, Om; Solanki, Bhavin; Sheth, Jay; Makwana, Govind; Kadam, Mina; Vyas, Sheetal; Shukla, Aparajita; Pethani, Jayshri; Tiwari, Hemant",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,,697

The major druggable targets of SARS-CoV-2 include 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent 26 RNA polymerase, and spike (S) protein. Molecular docking studies have highlighted that quercetin, a natural polyphenol belonging to the flavonol class, inhibits 3CLpro, PLpro and S proteins. Biophysical technics have then very recently confirmed that quercetin is reasonably a potent inhibitor of 3CLpro. The likely antiviral properties of quercetin are anyway challenged by its very poor oral bioavailability profile and any attempt to overcome this limit should be welcome. A phospholipid delivery form of quercetin (Quercetin Phytosome®) has been recently tested in humans to evaluate a possible improvement in oral bioavailability. After hydrolysis of the conjugated form (mainly glucuronide) of quercetin found in human plasma, the pharmacokinetics results have demonstrated an increased bioavailability rate by about 20-fold for total quercetin. It has been also observed that the presence of specific glucuronidase could yield free systemic quercetin in human body. Taking also into considerations its anti-inflammatory and thrombin-inhibitory actions, a bioavailable form of quercetin, like Quercetin Phytosome®, should be considered a possible candidate to clinically face COVID-19.","Di Pierro, Francesco; Khan, Amjad; Bertuccioli, Alexander; Maffioli, Pamela; Derosa, Giuseppe; Khan, Saeed; Khan, Bilal A; Nigar, Roohi; Ujjan, Ikram; Devrajani, Bikha R",Minerva Gastroenterol (Torino),,697

It is currently unknown where the potential sites of action are in the neonate for these robust levels of circulating AVP at birth. The purpose of this study is to identify the location of AVP receptor 1a (AVPR1A) sites as potential peripheral targets of AVP in the neonatal mouse. RT-qPCR analysis of a sampling of tissues from the head demonstrated the presence of Avpr1a mRNA, suggesting local peripheral translation. Using competitive autoradiography in wildtype (WT) and AVPR1A knockout (KO) postnatal day 0 (P0) male and female mice on a C57BL/6J background, specific AVPR1A ligand binding was observed in the neonatal mouse periphery in sensory tissues of the head (eyes, ears, various oronasal regions), bone, spinal cord, adrenal cortex, and the uro-anogenital region in the neonatal AVPR1A WT mouse, as it was significantly reduced or absent in the control samples (AVPR1A KO and competition).

The profoundly powerful and quickly advancing circumstance with COVID-19 has made it hard to get precise, on-request latest data with respect to the virus. Especially, the frontline workers of the battle medical services experts, policymakers, clinical scientists, and so on will require expert specific methods to stay aware of this literature for getting scientific knowledge of the latest research findings. The risks are most certainly not trivial, as decisions made on fallacious, answers may endanger trust or general well being and security of the public. But, with thousands of research papers being dispensed on the topic, making it more difficult to keep track of the latest research. Taking these challenges into account we have proposed COBERT: a retriever-reader dual algorithmic system that answers the complex queries by searching a document of 59K corona virus-related literature made accessible through the Coronavirus Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19). The retriever is composed of a TF-IDF vectorizer capturing the top 500 documents with optimal scores. The reader which is pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) on SQuAD 1.1 dev dataset built on top of the HuggingFace BERT transformers, refines the sentences from the filtered documents, which are then passed into ranker which compares the logits scores to produce a short answer, title of the paper and source article of extraction.

The objective of this review is to summarize how this pandemic has affected the activity of a Reproductive Medicine Center, which established a series of measures in parallel with governments decisions and scientific societies. RECENT FINDINGS: The control measures adopted for restarting the healthcare activity should be equitable and inclusive. Moreover, this pandemic has implied changes in treatments and strategies to be alert regarding the daily changing information. Finally, for ensuring a safe practice both for patients and staff, it is important to detect asymptomatic patients, so Reproductive Medicine centers must take special care with screening and testing procedures. SUMMARY: The pandemic has pushed up toward a new reality in terms of Assisted Reproductive treatments, where social distance and responsibility are protagonists. We face a new challenge of balancing between responding to the committed efforts of infertile couples to achieve pregnancy and safeguarding the health of the future parents and their children during this time of pandemic.","Cruz, M; Requena, Antonio",Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol,,697
349214,Corona and value change. The role of social media and emotional contagion,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 became a global pandemic within weeks, as every country including small states and islands experienced a surge in cases. Small islands are known to face a number of challenges but in the quest to curb the viral spread, with the absence of land boarders and small population size, these factors should have played to their advantage to minimize the spread. The aim of this article was to compare and contrast the COVID-19 situation, restrictions, preparedness, management and the healthcare systems between the small population island states of Cyprus, Iceland and Malta. METHOD: Data were obtained from Ministry of Health websites and COVID dashboards of the three respective Island states in Europe. Comparisons were made between the reported cases, deaths, swabbing rates, restrictions and mitigation measures and healthcare system structures. RESULTS: Malta contained the COVID-19 spread better than Cyprus and Iceland during the first wave. However, a significantly higher viral spread was observed in Malta during the second wave. Similar healthcare preparedness and services, restrictions and relaxation measures were implemented across the three islands with some exceptions such as the maximum number of people permitted in one gathering, free movement restrictions and airport regulations. CONCLUSION: The small population size and island status proved to be an asset during the first wave of COVID-19 but different governance approaches led to a different COVID-19 outcome during the transition phases and the onset of the second wave.","Cuschieri, Sarah; Pallari, Elena; Hatziyianni, Amalia; Sigurvinsdottir, Rannveig; Sigfusdottir, Inga Dora; Sigurðardóttir, Árún Kristín",Early Hum Dev,,697
349699,Compassionate Flexibility and Self-Discipline: Student Adaptation to Emergency Remote Teaching in an Integrated Engineering Energy Course during COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The intensive care environment in hospitals has been the subject of significant empirical and qualitative research in the 2005-2020 period. Particular attention has been devoted to the role of infection control, family engagement, staff performance, and the built environment ramifications of the recent COVID-19 global pandemic. A comprehensive review of this literature is reported summarizing recent advancements in this rapidly expanding body of knowledge. PURPOSE AND AIM: This comprehensive review conceptually structures the recent medical intensive care literature to provide conceptual clarity and identify current priorities and future evidence-based research and design priorities. METHOD AND RESULT: Each source reviewed was classified as one of the five types-opinion pieces/essays, cross-sectional empirical investigations, nonrandomized comparative investigations, randomized studies, and policy review essays-and into nine content categories: nature engagement and outdoor views; family accommodations; intensive care unit (ICU), neonatal ICU, and pediatric ICU spatial configuration and amenity; noise considerations; artificial and natural lighting; patient safety and infection control; portable critical care field hospitals and disaster mitigation facilities including COVID-19; ecological sustainability; and recent planning and design trends and prognostications. CONCLUSIONS: Among the findings embodied in the 135 literature sources reviewed, single-bed ICU rooms have increasingly become the norm; family engagement in the ICU experience has increased; acknowledgment of the therapeutic role of staff amenities; exposure to nature, view, and natural daylight has increased; the importance of ecological sustainability; and pandemic concerns have increased significantly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Discussion of the results of this comprehensive review includes topics noticeably overlooked or underinvestigated in the 2005-2020 period and priorities for future research.","Verderber, Stephen; Gray, Seth; Suresh-Kumar, Shivathmikha; Kercz, Damian; Parshuram, Christopher",HERD,,697
350016,The Imposed Online Learning and Teaching During COVID-19 Times,2020,"This Viewpoint argues that the debates about the future of education and the need to rethink the school model started long before the pandemic crisis. But the situation we are experiencing has accelerated this need and showed that changes are possible. Consumerist trends in education have been accentuated, now with the massive use of digital tools. These trends, which, since the beginning of the twenty-first century, have supported ""personalization of learning"", can lead to the disintegration of the school. But dynamics of transformation and metamorphosis of the school have also emerged, reinforcing education as a public and common good. The authors seek to enunciate these dynamics that redefine three bases of the school model: the social contract around education, the organizational structure of the school, and the pedagogy of the lesson.","Nóvoa, António; Alvim, Yara",Prospects (Paris),,697

Objective: To determine whether adults with risk factors for COVID-19 complications perceive an elevated chance of complications and undertake fewer higher infection risk behaviors. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional analysis, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, included civilian noninstitutionalized US adults of wave 18 of the Understanding America Study collected from November 11 to December 9, 2020. Exposures: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-identified medical risk factors for COVID-19 complications and older age. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were perceived percentage chance of infection and hospitalization and death if infected; whether 9 potentially higher infection risk activities were undertaken in the past week and, if so, whether a mask was worn; whether a mask was worn anywhere in the past week; and attitudes toward 12 aspects of mask wearing. Results: In Understanding America Study wave 18 (n = 5910 participants with nonmissing data), the mean age was 48 years, and 52% were women. The response rate was 77%. Adults with 7 of 9 medical risk factors and aged 70 years and older reported a higher perceived chance of complications if infected. Adjusted mean perceived chance of hospitalization if infected ranged from 23.9% (95% CI, 22.2%-25.5%) for those with high blood pressure to 40.4% (95% CI, 34.6%-46.2%) for those with chronic lung disease and was associated with number of medical risk factors: 17.6% (95% CI, 16.4%-18.8%) and 41.8% (95% CI, 38.7%-45.0%) for adults with 0 vs 3 or more medical risk factors, respectively. Fewer potentially higher infection risk activities were undertaken by adults with 3 or more vs 0 risk factors: 2.83 (95% CI, 2.66-2.99) vs 3.12 (95% CI, 3.02-3.22). Wearing a mask sometime last week was nearly universal (90.1%). But during only 1 specific activity (visiting a grocery store or pharmacy) did more than half always wear a mask, and for only 1 activity (visiting a grocery store or pharmacy) was mask wearing more common among adults with 3 or more vs 0 conditions. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional survey study, adults with risk factors for COVID-19 complications reported higher perceived susceptibility to complications. During common activities, including visiting with friends, the majority of adults, including the highly susceptible, did not consistently wear masks.","Schoeni, Robert F; Wiemers, Emily E; Seltzer, Judith A; Langa, Kenneth M",JAMA Netw Open,,697

To keep students engaged with the university, we implemented a teaching-learning model that relates physiology contents to the COVID-19 pandemic using online educational platforms. A 1-mo web course was proposed for health sciences students from the Federal University of Pampa. It included synchronous meetings twice a week and asynchronous activities using scientific articles, case studies, and interactive online tools. The students approved the methodology developed, assessing it as dynamic and innovative. They reported that the activity helped to better understand the relations between COVID-19 and physiological systems. The web course also contributed to the identification of reliable sources of news and stimulated the sharing of scientific content with their families. We concluded that the use of online platforms contextualizing the physiology content considering current events helps students in learning human physiology and improves their abilities to apply this information to their daily life, in this specific case, regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alves, Niege; Carrazoni, Guilherme Salgado; Soares, Caroline Bitencourt; Rosa, Ana Carolina de Souza da; Soares, Náthaly Marks; Mello-Carpes, Pâmela Billig",Adv Physiol Educ,,697
352649,COVID-19 impact on stock market: Evidence from the Indian stock market,2021,"Transcription occurs across more than 70% of the human genome and more than half of currently annotated genes produce functional noncoding RNAs. Of these transcripts, the majority-long, noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)-are greater than 200 nucleotides in length and are necessary for various roles in the cell. It is increasingly appreciated that these lncRNAs are relevant in both health and disease states, with the brain expressing the largest number of lncRNAs compared to other organs. Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive, fatal brain tumor that demonstrates remarkable intratumoral heterogeneity, which has made the development of effective therapies challenging. The cooperation between genetic and epigenetic alterations drives rapid adaptation that allows therapeutic evasion and recurrence. Given the large repertoire of lncRNAs in normal brain tissue and the well-described roles of lncRNAs in molecular and cellular processes, these transcripts are important to consider in the context of GBM heterogeneity and treatment resistance. Herein, we review the general mechanisms and biological roles of lncRNAs, with a focus on GBM, as well as RNA-based therapeutics currently in development.","DeSouza, Patrick A; Qu, Xuan; Chen, Hao; Patel, Bhuvic; Maher, Christopher A; Kim, Albert H",,,697

Since the first case was recorded on December 29, 2019, in Wuhan of China, the disease has rapidly extended to other nations of the world to claim many lives, especially in the USA, the United Kingdom, and Western Europe. To stay ahead of the curve consequent of the continued increase in case and mortality, predictive tools are needed to guide adequate response. Therefore, this study aims to determine the best predictive models and investigate the impact of lockdown policy on the USA' COVID-19 incidence and mortality. This study focuses on the statistical modelling of the USA daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality cases based on some intuitive properties of the data such as overdispersion and autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. The impact of the lockdown policy on cases and mortality was assessed by comparing the USA incidence case with that of Sweden where there is no strict lockdown. Stochastic models based on negative binomial autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity [NB INGARCH (p,q)], the negative binomial regression, the autoregressive integrated moving average model with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) and without exogenous variables (ARIMA) models of several orders are presented, to identify the best fitting model for the USA daily incidence cases. The performance of the optimal NB INGARCH model on daily incidence cases was compared with the optimal ARIMA model in terms of their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). Also, the NB model, ARIMA model and without exogenous variables are formulated for USA daily COVID-19 death cases. It was observed that the incidence and mortality cases show statistically significant increasing trends over the study period. The USA daily COVID-19 incidence is autocorrelated, linear and contains a structural break but exhibits autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. Observed data are compared with the fitted data from the optimal models. The results further indicate that the NB INGARCH fits the observed incidence better than ARIMA while the NB models perform better than the optimal ARIMA and ARIMAX models for death counts in terms of AIC and root mean square error (RMSE). The results show a statistically significant relationship between the lockdown policy in the USA and incidence and death counts. This suggests the efficacy of the lockdown policy in the USA.","Makinde, Olusola S; Adeola, Abiodun M; Abiodun, Gbenga J; Olusola-Makinde, Olubukola O; Alejandro, Aceves",J Epidemiol Glob Health,,697

The website of the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry(www.chictr.org.cn) and the American Clinical Trial Registry(clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to collect protocols of TCM for COVID-19. Documents were screened following the inclusion criteria, and data were extracted in regard to registration date, study objective, type of design, sponsor, patient, sample size, intervention, and evaluation index. Descriptive analysis was conducted. A total of 49 clinical trial protocols of TCM for COVID-19 were included. Primary sponsors were mainly hospitals or universities in places like Hubei, Beijing, Zhejiang and other regions. The implementation units are mainly in Hubei, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan and other regional hospitals. The types of study design were mainly experimental studies(40), including 30 randomized parallel controlled trials, 7 non-randomized controlled trials, 2 single arm trials and 1 consecutively recruited trial; besides, there were also 6 observational studies, 2 health service studies and 1 preventive study. The sample size reached a total of 30 562 cases, with a maximum of 20 000 for a single study and a minimum of 30.

METHOD: A scoping review was conducted on peer-reviewed studies between 1996-2019. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies reported on the use of psychological eHealth interventions focused on mental health problems and/or challenging behaviour. The vast majority of these studies reported on interventions that were delivered at the individual level. The context in which these interventions were delivered varied, primarily ranging from the home setting to residential settings, as well as day or activity centres and schools. The studies described various types of interventions: telehealth interventions, computerized cognitive behavioural therapy, and interventions focused on (social) learning principles targeting challenging behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: eHealth provides new opportunities for both therapists and lay-therapists to deliver psychological interventions. Future studies should focus on the effectiveness of psychological eHealth interventions.","Oudshoorn, Cathelijn E M; Frielink, Noud; Nijs, Sara L P; Embregts, Petri J C M","JARID, J. appl. res. intellect. disabil",,697

Exploration in Asian cities using statistical models,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the face of education for undergraduate and graduate medical trainees. Lectures, clinical clerkships, and testing have all been impacted significantly because of patient care needs and concern for the health and safety of trainees. While traditional teaching strategies have been upended, the challenges posed by the pandemic have also created unique opportunities for trainees. In this article, the authors summarize lessons trainees can learn from the ongoing pandemic in the following areas: public health, disaster preparedness, and resource allocation; reinventing professional and personal roles to meet the needs of the health care system; flexibility in navigating testing, licensure, and certification; appraising scientific evidence quickly and accurately; balancing a physician's call to duty with fear for personal safety; combating moral injury; interprofessional collaboration; and advocating for oneself and colleagues. Focusing on these lessons can help educators steer their efforts to better prepare future physicians for unforeseen challenges that may come up in their personal and professional lives as well as in society as a whole.","Jain, Snigdha; Carlos, W Graham",Acad. med,,697
358261,User acceptance of electric car-sharing services: The case of the Netherlands,2021,"PURPOSE: We have previously reported an association between high red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and mortality in septic and brain infarction patients. However, no association between RDW and mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients has been reported so far; thus, the objective of this study was to determine if that association exists. METHODS: Prospective and observational study carried out in 8 Intensive Care Units from 6 hospitals of Canary Islands (Spain) including COVID-19 patients. We recorded RDW at ICU admission and 30-day survival. RESULTS: We found that patients who did not survive (n=25) compared to surviving patients (n=118) were older (p=0.004), showed higher RDW (p=0.001), urea (p<0.001), APACHE-II (p<0.001) and SOFA (p<0.001), and lower platelet count (p=0.007) and pH (p=0.008). Multiple binomial logistic regression analysis showed that RDW was associated with 30-day mortality after controlling for: SOFA and age (OR=1.659; 95% CI=1.130-2.434; p=0.01); APACHE-II and platelet count (OR=2.062; 95% CI=1.359-3.129; p=0.001); and pH and urea (OR=1.797; 95% CI=1.250-2.582; p=0.002). The area under the curve (AUC) of RDW for mortality prediction was of 71% (95% CI=63-78%; p<0.001). We did not find significant differences in the predictive capacity between RDW and SOFA (p=0.66) or between RDW and APACHE-II (p=0.12). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new information regarding the ability to predict mortality in patients with COVID-19. There is an association between high RDW and mortality. RDW has a good performance to predict 30-day mortality, similar to other severity scores (such as APACHE II and SOFA) but easier and faster to obtain.","Lorente, Leonardo; Martín, María M; Argueso, Mónica; Solé-Violán, Jordi; Perez, Alina; Marcos Y Ramos, José Alberto; Ramos-Gómez, Luis; López, Sergio; Franco, Andrés; González-Rivero, Agustín F; Martín, María; Gonzalez, Verónica; Alcoba-Flórez, Julia; Rodriguez, Miguel Ángel; Riaño-Ruiz, Marta; Guillermo O Campo, Juan; González, Lourdes; Cantera, Tamara; Ortiz-López, Raquel; Ojeda, Nazario; Rodríguez-Pérez, Aurelio; Domínguez, Casimira; Jiménez, Alejandro",Anaesth Crit Care Pain Med,,697

Little is known about the use of palliative care services in intensive care unit (ICU) settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission, between 7 March and 14 April 2020 to two academic teaching hospitals in New York City. Palliative care consultation included a one-time telemedicine consultation or continued telemedicine consultation and follow-up with multidisciplinary team involvement. Patient information was collected from the electronic health record and analyses were conducted with Stata V.15.1 (StataCorp) statistical software. RESULTS: A total of 151 critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ICU admission were identified, of whom 59 (39.07%) received an inpatient palliative care consultation. More than half of patients died (n=85/151, 56.29%), with 57.65% (n=49/85) of these patients receiving palliative care services during their hospitalisation. Patients who received palliative care consultation were more likely to be older, sicker and receive mechanical ventilation than their counterparts. Patients who died and did not receive palliative care were younger and required non-invasive ventilation support. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of utilisation of palliative care in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Further research into predictors of poor outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients may help identify patients that would benefit from early palliative care involvement going forward.","Sheehan, Jacqueline; Ho, Kam Sing; Poon, Joseph; Sarosky, Kimberly; Fung, Jennifer Y",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),,697

App-based solutions have emerged for Contact Tracing, including a protocol designed by Apple and Google (influenced by an open-source protocol known as DP3T). This protocol contains two well-documented de-anonymisation attacks. Firstly that when someone is marked as having tested positive and their keys are made public, they can be tracked over a large geographic area for 24 hours at a time. Secondly, whilst the app requires a minimum exposure duration to register a contact, there is no cryptographic guarantee for this property. This means an adversary can scan Bluetooth networks and retrospectively find who is infected. We propose a novel""cross hashing""approach to cryptographically guarantee minimum exposure durations. We further mitigate the 24-hour data exposure of infected individuals and reduce computational time for identifying if a user has been exposed using k-Anonymity buckets of hashes and Private Set Intersection.","Ali, Junade; Dyo, Vladimir",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12884v1.pdf,697
358877,NewsTweet: A Dataset of Social Media Embedding in Online Journalism,2020-08-06,"Aerosolized droplets play a central role in the transmission of various infectious diseases, including Legionnaire's disease, gastroenteritis-causing norovirus, and most recently COVID-19. Respiratory droplets are known to be the most prominent source of transmission for COVID-19, however, alternative routes may exist given the discovery of small numbers of viable viruses in urine and stool samples. Flushing biomatter can lead to the aerosolization of microorganisms, thus, there is a likelihood that bioaerosols generated in public restrooms may pose a concern for the transmission of COVID-19, especially since these areas are relatively confined, experience heavy foot traffic, and may suffer from inadequate ventilation. To quantify the extent of aerosolization, we measure the size and number of droplets generated by flushing toilets and urinals in a public restroom. The results indicate that the particular designs tested in the study generate a large number of droplets in the size range 0.3$\mu m$ to 3$\mu m$, which can reach heights of at least 1.52m. Covering the toilet reduced aerosol levels but did not eliminate them completely, suggesting that aerosolized droplets escaped through small gaps between the cover and the seat. In addition to consistent increases in aerosol levels immediately after flushing, there was a notable rise in ambient aerosol levels due to the accumulation of droplets from multiple flushes conducted during the tests. This highlights the need for incorporating adequate ventilation in the design and operation of public spaces, which can help prevent aerosol accumulation in high occupancy areas and mitigate the risk of airborne disease transmission.","Schreck, Jesse H.; Lashaki, Masoud Jahandar; Hashemi, Javad; Dhanak, Manhar; Verma, Siddhartha",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11990v1.pdf,697
359256,Tail risk contagion between international financial markets during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The world is facing a public health emergency situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological wellbeing among individuals worldwide has been negatively affected by the pandemic especially in low- and middle-income countries such as Bangladesh. The present study aimed to assess the estimate of depressive symptoms and investigated its associations with COVID-19 preventive practice measures, daily activities in home quarantine, and suicidal behaviors in a large-scale Bangladeshi online survey. METHODS: An online-based cross-sectional survey was widely distributed to Bangladeshi citizens. A total of 13,654 participants (61.0% male; mean age = 24.0 years [SD = 6.0]; age range 18-65 years) completed the survey between May and June (2020). The survey included socio-demographics and COVID-19-related questions, along with lifestyle, suicidal, and psychometric measures. Hierarchical regression was performed to determine significant associations between depression and examined variables. RESULTS: The estimate of depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic was 43.5%. Based on hierarchical regression analysis, depression was significantly associated with not engaging in COVID-19 preventive measures, daily activities in home quarantine (e.g., playing videogames), and suicidal behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms appeared to be high during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. To fight against the pandemic, mental health issues as well as physical health issues need to be taken into consideration.","Islam, Md Saiful; Tasnim, Rafia; Sujan, Md Safaet Hossain; Ferdous, Most Zannatul; Sikder, Md Tajuddin; Masud, Jakir Hossain Bhuiyan; Kundu, Sourav; Tahsin, Promi; Mosaddek, Abu Syed Md; Griffiths, Mark D",BMC Psychiatry,,697

The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on host targets remains largely limited, hampering our understanding of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis and the development of therapeutic strategies. The present study used a comprehensive untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic approach to capture the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that several circulating lipids acted as potential biomarkers, such as phosphatidylcholine 14:0_22:6 (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.96), phosphatidylcholine 16:1_22:6 (AUC = 0.97), and phosphatidylethanolamine 18:1_20:4 (AUC = 0.94). Furthermore, triglycerides and free fatty acids, especially arachidonic acid (AUC = 0.99) and oleic acid (AUC = 0.98), were well correlated to the severity of the disease. An untargeted analysis of non-critical COVID-19 patients identified a strong alteration of lipids and a perturbation of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA degradation, arachidonic acid metabolism, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The severity of the disease was characterized by the activation of gluconeogenesis and the metabolism of porphyrins, which play a crucial role in the progress of the infection. In addition, our study provided further evidence for considering phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity as a potential key factor in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and a possible therapeutic target. To date, the present study provides the largest untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics analysis of plasma from COVID-19 patients and control groups, identifying new mechanisms associated with the host response to COVID-19, potential plasma biomarkers, and therapeutic targets.","Barberis, Elettra; Timo, Sara; Amede, Elia; Vanella, Virginia V; Puricelli, Chiara; Cappellano, Giuseppe; Raineri, Davide; Cittone, Micol G; Rizzi, Eleonora; Pedrinelli, Anita R; Vassia, Veronica; Casciaro, Francesco G; Priora, Simona; Nerici, Ilaria; Galbiati, Alessandra; Hayden, Eyal; Falasca, Marco; Vaschetto, Rosanna; Sainaghi, Pier Paolo; Dianzani, Umberto; Rolla, Roberta; Chiocchetti, Annalisa; Baldanzi, Gianluca; Marengo, Emilio; Manfredi, Marcello",Int. j. mol. sci.

This document is a position statement from the Egyptian Society of Cardiology. It aims to provide information to cardiovascular healthcare providers in Egypt to guarantee delivery of quality patient care and ensure adequate levels of protection against infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older patients and those with cardiovascular disease are at higher risk of mortality. The current situation requires unusual allocation of resources which may negatively impact the care of patients with cardiovascular disease. Cardiologists should be prepared in the COVID-19 pandemic. The challenge is in providing the best quality of care despite limited resources while keeping all medical staff as safe as possible. Consider deferring elective procedures whenever possible. All medical staff should undergo rigorous training on infection control and the use of high-quality personal protection equipment. Cardiologists should promote telemedicine in the outpatient setting, prioritize outpatient contacts, and avoid nosocomial dissemination of the virus to patients and healthcare providers. A much conservative approach for emergent cardiac patients is recommended, and invasive interventions are reserved for high risk hemodynamically unstable patients. During the pandemic, the most important principles of treatment should be controlling the spread of infection as the first priority, prompt assessment of patient risk, recommending conservative medical therapy rather than invasive interventions, and strict infection control measures to limit infection spread within the hospital and to healthcare workers.","Shaheen, Sameh; Awwad, Omar; Shokry, Khalid; Abdel-Hamid, Magdy; El-Etriby, Adel; Hasan-Ali, Hsam; Shawky, Islam; Magdy, Ahmad; Nasr, Gamila; Kabil, Hamza; Elhadidy, Amr; Zaki, Mohamad; Hegab, Ahmad",Egypt.

SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs through the interaction of the viral protein Spike with the angiotensin II receptor (ACE 2), leading to an increase of angiotensin II and activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase2 (NOX2), resulting in the release of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory molecules. The purpose of the review is to explain that SARS-CoV-2 infection can determine neuroinflammation that induces NOX2 activation in microglia. To better understand the role of NOX2 in inflammation, an overview of its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is provided. To write this manuscript, we performed a PubMed search to evaluate the possible relationship of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NOX2 activation in microglia, as well as the role of NOX2 in NDs. Several studies highlighted that NOX2 activation in microglia amplifies neuroinflammation. To date, there is no clinical treatment capable of counteracting its activation, however, NOX2 could be a promising pharmaceutical target useful for both the treatment and prevention of NDs and COVID-19 treatment.","Sindona, Cinzia; Schepici, Giovanni; Contestabile, Valentina; Bramanti, Placido; Mazzon, Emanuela",Medicina (Kaunas),,697

This dictates the necessity to transfer scientific testing technologies to medical practice. Here, we demonstrated the method of phenotyping and quantitative analysis of plasma EVs based on differential centrifugation, immunostaining, and high-sensitivity multicolor flow cytometry. We used EV markers that were potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 dissemination via vesicles and cell-origination markers, characterizing objects from different cell types that could influence clinical manifestation of COVID-19. Plasma levels of CD235a+ and CD14+ EVs in patients with moderate infection were significantly increased while CD8+ and CD19+ EVs were decreased comparing with HD. Patients with severe infection had lower levels of CD4+, CD19+, and CD146+ EVs than HD. These findings demonstrate that EV concentrations in COVID-19 are severity related. Moreover, the three-point dynamic assessment demonstrated significant loss of CD63+ and CD147+ plasma EVs. The used method can be a convenient tool for vital infection pathogenesis investigation and for COVID-19 diagnostics.","Kudryavtsev, I.; Kalinina, O.; Bezrukikh, V.; Melnik, O.; Golovkin, A.",Viruses,,697

Ultrasonography was performed to determine follicular size, ovulation occurrence, and size of CL. In Experiment 2, heifers were assigned to three groups: Control (n = 264), FA-5/GnRH, and FA-4/GnRH. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed at Days 30 and 60. In Experiment 1, size of largest follicle at time of PGF was less variable (P &#8804; 0.05) in all FA groups compared to the Control group. With the FA-5/GnRH and FA-4/GnRH treatments, there were greater (P &#8804; 0.05) proportions of timing of ovulation synchronization (86 % and 85 %, respectively) compared to the Control (61 %) and FA-3/GnRH (62 %) groups. In Experiment 2, conception rates did not differ among groups, however, there were more pregnancies per cow when timing-of-ovulation treatments were imposed. In conclusion, follicular ablation combined with GnRH treatment resulted in an increased proportion of heifers having synchronized ovulation and, therefore, number of recipient heifers available for embryo transfer. Additionally, there was no effect on conception rate when there was greater synchronization in timing of ovulation among heifers.","Manuel Palomino, J; Grand, François-Xavier; Vigneault, Christian; Blondin, Patrick; Sirard, Marc-André",Anim Reprod Sci,,697

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the admission CXR of 327 patients accessed to our institute during the Italian pandemic descending phase (April 2020). For each CXR were searched ground glass opacification (GGO), consolidation (CO), reticular-nodular opacities (RNO), nodules, excavations, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, vascular congestion and cardiac enlargement. For lung alterations was defined the predominance (upper or basal, focal or diffuse, central or peripheric, etc.). Then radiologists assessed whether CXRs were suggestive or not for COVID-19 infection. For COVID-19 patients, a prognostic score was applied and correlated with the patients' outcome. RESULTS: CXR showed 83% of specificity and 60% of sensitivity. GGO, CO, RNO and a peripheric, diffuse and basal prevalence showed good correlation with COVID-19 diagnosis. A logistic regression analysis pointed out GGO and a basal or diffuse distribution as independent predictors of COVID-19 diagnosis. The prognostic score showed good correlation with the patients' outcome. CONCLUSION: In our study, admission CXR showed a fair specificity and a good correlation with patients' outcome. GGO and others CXR findings showed a good correlation with COVID-19 diagnosis; besides GGO a diffuse or bibasal distribution resulted in independent variables highly suggestive for COVID-19 infection thus enabling radiologists to signal to clinicians radiologically suspect patients during the pandemic descending phase.","Moroni, Chiara; Cozzi, Diletta; Albanesi, Marco; Cavigli, Edoardo; Bindi, Alessandra; Luvarà, Silvia; Busoni, Simone; Mazzoni, Lorenzo Nicola; Grifoni, Stefano; Nazerian, Peiman; Miele, Vittorio",,,697

COVID-19 has shown humanity the importance of renewable energy systems and proper waste management systems. In this developed system, the shredded waste tires are used to produce energy in the form of hydrogen and the syngas produced at the gasification unit. It is further utilized for the closed Rankine cycle and Forward-Multi Effect Desalination Unit. This hybrid system is also incorporated with integrated anaerobic digestion and composting unit to create a circular economy unlike traditional systems. This proposed system is simulated dynamically by investigating the effect of changing solar intensities throughout the months in a year. Furthermore, the gasification products are analyzed by altering the steam and oxygen feed rate within the system. This system utilizes closed landfills with a renewable energy system, Solar Tower Cycle, to produce energy and steam. This steam is then further utilized at the gasification unit as a gasification agent to increase hydrogen production. The total energy and freshwater produced within this integrated system is calculated to be 163 MW/h and 2.16 tonnes during its operation in a day. In addition, the hydrogen to fuel ratio at the gasifier and the hourly methane production at the anaerobic digestion unit are found to be 0.175 and 309 m3/h, respectively. The overall energy and exergy efficiency of this proposed system is observed to be 74% and 73%, in this order.","Gungor, B.; Dincer, I.",Journal of Cleaner Production,,697

As a secondary analysis from the multicenter INSPIRE study (NCT01602211), we examined baseline data from relapse-free HCT adult survivors (2 to 10 years after allogeneic or autologous HCT) to investigate the association between driving distances and patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of distress and physical function. We analyzed predictors of elevated distress and impaired physical function using logistic regression models that operationalized driving distance first as a continuous variable and separately as a dichotomous variable (<100 versus 100+ miles). Of 1136 patients available for analysis from 6 US centers, median driving distance was 82 miles and 44% resided 100+ miles away from their HCT centers. Elevated distress was reported by 32% of patients, impaired physical function by 19%, and both by 12%. Driving distance, whether operationalized as a continuous or dichotomous variable, had no impact on distress or physical function in linear regression modeling (95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.00, for both PROs with driving distance as a continuous variable). In contrast, chronic graft-versus-host-disease, lower income, and lack of Internet access independently predicted both elevated distress and impaired physical function. In summary, we found no impact of driving distance on distress and physical function among HCT survivors. Our results have implications for how long-term follow-up care is delivered after HCT, with regard to the negligible impact of driving distances on PROs and also the risk of a ""digital divide"" worsening outcomes among HCT survivors without Internet access.","Banerjee, Rahul; Yi, Jean C; Majhail, Navneet S; Jim, Heather S L; Uberti, Joseph; Whalen, Victoria; Loren, Alison W; Syrjala, Karen L",Biol. blood marrow transplant,,697

Only a few reports have described the involvement of the spinal cord among COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, little is known about the risk of individuals with chronic degenerative conditions of the spine for acute neurological complications of COVID-19. Case presentation: Here, we describe the case of a 73-year-old man with a subclinical cervical multifocal spondylotic myelopathy that manifested neurological symptoms of spinal cord injury some days after getting infected with SARS-CoV-2. The patient did not show any data associated with respiratory involvement and improved clinically after decompressive spinal surgery and administration of steroids. Conclusions: This is the first reported case of an acute exacerbation of a chronic degenerative condition of the spine caused by COVID-19.","Guadarrama-Ortiz, Parménides; Choreño-Parra, José Alberto; Javier Pacheco-Sánchez, Francisco; Ponce-Sánchez, Jesús Manuel; García-Quintero, Gabriela; Rodríguez-Muñoz, Patricia E; Prieto-Rivera, Ángel Daniel",Interdiscip Neurosurg,,697

Older individuals are at higher risk compared with younger adults and children due to the presence of weaker immune functions. Healthcare workers are also at higher risk due to close proximity with the infected cases. Proper precautions and hand hygiene techniques can prevent the transmission of the disease. There is a dearth of evidence on how to manage the disease; therefore, protective measures might help to reduce the spread of infection. This article aimed to evaluate the preventive measure and use of protective equipment among healthcare workers and community settings. Subjects and methods: Various recent literature searched in the following databases-Medline/PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus-recommendations from centre for disease control and prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) reports on preventive measures of COVID-19 were included. Results: After reviewing the previous literature, we summarized proper precautions and hygiene techniques, use of PPE and applicability of surgical and N95 (can block 95% small particles but not resistant to oil) masks to prevent the transmission of disease. Conclusion: This viewpoint can be considered as a unique example of information on infection control and protective measures. However, due to the lack of evidence, further research is required to compare the effectiveness of medical masks and N95 masks.","Srivastav, Adarsh Kumar; Saini, Vipin; Kukkar, Vipin; Rathore, Mahendra Singh; Khadayat, Sarita; Samuel, Asir John",Z Gesundh Wiss,,697

OBJECTIVE: We examine the COVID-19-related healthcare utilization and mortality by race and ethnicity of patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: We used the VHA COVID-19 shared data resources between February 1 and June 30, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Veterans tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus by VHA. EXPOSURE(S): Three racial-ethnicity groups of Black, Hispanic, and White (as reference) veterans. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): Main outcomes are testing rate, positivity rate, hospitalization rate, ICU admission rate, and in-hospital mortality. Controlling for sex, age, and Elixhauser comorbidity index, we report adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) from logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of the 8,667,996 active veteran enrollees, 252,702 were tested by VHA from February to June, 2020, with 20,500 positive results and 4,790 hospitalizations. The testing rate was 4.4% among Black and 4.7% among Hispanic veterans compared to White veterans, 2.8%. The testing positivity rate was similarly elevated among Black (12.2%) and Hispanic (11.6%) veterans compared to White veterans (6.0%). The aORs of hospitalization in Black veterans (1.88; 95% CI 1.74, 2.03) and Hispanic veterans (1.41; 95% CI 1.25, 1.60) were higher compared to White veterans. No significant differences by race and ethnicity were observed in OR or aOR of ICU admission and in-hospital death among hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: On a national level, the VHA was more likely to test and hospitalize Black and Hispanic veterans compared to White veterans, but there were no significant differences in ICU admission or in-hospital mortality among those hospitalized. This pattern of differences may relate to social determinants of health, factors affecting access to non-VHA care, or preferences for VHA care affecting initial care seeking, but not in-hospital outcomes.","Razjouyan, Javad; Helmer, Drew A; Li, Ang; Naik, Aanand D; Amos, Christopher I; Bandi, Venkata; Sharafkhaneh, Amir",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,697

Therapeutic approaches to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection are mostly focused on blocking S-ACE2 binding, but critical residues that stabilize this interaction are not well understood. By performing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified an extended network of salt bridges, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonds between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein and ACE2. Mutagenesis of these residues on the RBD was not sufficient to destabilize binding but reduced the average work to unbind the S protein from ACE2. In particular, the hydrophobic end of RBD serves as the main anchor site and is the last to unbind from ACE2 under force. We propose that blocking the hydrophobic surface of RBD via neutralizing antibodies could prove to be an effective strategy to inhibit S-ACE2 interactions.","Taka, Elhan; Yilmaz, Sema Z; Golcuk, Mert; Kilinc, Ceren; Aktas, Umut; Yildiz, Ahmet; Gur, Mert",J Phys Chem B,,697

The MSC has warned that awarding all students their predicted grades could result in ""a higher likelihood of a greater than usual failure rate as students progress through their very demanding studies "" 2 Chris McManus, professor of psychology and medical education at University College London, and colleagues have conducted research that shows that A level exam results, rather than predicted grades, are the better predictor of how well a student will perform at medical school 3 Their results indicate that students whose predicted grades were higher than the grades they would have achieved if they sat their exams may struggle ""We know there are always some students who are challenged by medical school,"" McManus says ""It is a really hard course When people let in students with lower A level grades they tend to do less well There is little doubt about that "" of the BMA's academic staff committee and a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School, warns that many universities are already struggling ""In six weeks' time we are going to have up to 20% more medical students in universities that are desperately trying to get people back into some sort of lecture programme, while knowing that we don't have the space for physical distancing,"" he said Medical schools are also suffering from a declining clinician academic workforce, with senior lecturer numbers falling by 27% since 2004 4 Strain warns that the decline is now being coupled with cuts to hours and, in some places, cuts to jobs ""We are seeing clinical academics being asked if they would defer their pay rises this year, as well as voluntary early retirement and voluntary redundancy schemes,"" he said The covid-19 pandemic has had a huge effect on universities' finances, Strain says ""Universities haven't been applying for grants because of the current environment, and the covid-19 studies that are being done are being done at a loss because the National Institute for Health Research only pays 80% of the total cost of the study,"" he says ""Some universities have also handed back student bursaries and accommodation fees, as well as losing fees from international students Charitable incomes have also fallen because of the pandemic "" All this means that universities will potentially be in the red by hundreds of millions of pounds at the start of the new term, Strain warns What does the government's promised funding for the extra students cover? Though an increase in teaching grant funding has been promised, it is unclear whether there will be extra funding for the additional students' clinical placements The health department has said that work is being done to ensure that clinical placements would be available for these additional students but did not respond to questions from The BMJ about how placements would be funded 1 the bmj ;BMJ 2020;370:m3358 ;doi: 10 1136/bmj m3358 NEWS The BMJ Cite his as: BMJ 2020;370:m3358","Rimmer, Abi",BMJ,,697

The objective was to examine type III, IV, and VI collagens turnovers in SSc and investigate longitudinal alterations in relation to modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS). We included patients fulfilling the 2013 ACR/EULAR criteria for SSc (limited cutaneous [lcSSc, n = 20], diffuse cutaneous SSc [dcSSc, n = 23]) and healthy controls (HC, n = 10). Biomarkers of type III, IV, and VI collagens formation (PRO-C3, PRO-C4, PRO-C6) and degradation (C3M, C4M, C6M) were measured in serum. The fibrotic index of the individual collagens (FICol) were calculated. The fibrotic index of type III and VI collagens (FICol3 and FICol6) were increased in dcSSc compared to lcSSc (FICol3: 1.4 vs. 0.8, P = 0.0001; FICol6: 1.2 vs. 0.9, P = 0.03). The fibrotic index of type IV collagen (FICol4) was not different between the groups but was 1.5 times higher than HC (HC: 6.9, lcSSc 10.4, dcSSc: 10.5). Both FICol3 and FICol6 correlated with mRSS with rho's of 0.59 (P < 0.0001) and 0.35 (P = 0.04). Furthermore, FICol3 steadily decrease over the disease course.

379742,Online Chemistry Crossword Puzzles prior to and during COVID-19: Light-Hearted Revision Aids That Work,2020,"COVID-19, since emerged in Wuhan, China, has been a major concern due to its high infection rate, leaving more than one million infected people around the world. Huge number of studies tried to reveal the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 compared to the SARS-CoV-1, in order to suppress this high infection rate. Some of these studies showed that the mutations in the SARS-CoV-1 Spike protein might be responsible for its higher affinity to the ACE2 human cell receptor. In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo sampling to compare the binding affinities of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 stronger than SARS-CoV by 7 kcal/mol, due to enhanced electrostatic interactions. The major contributions to the electrostatic binding energies are resulting from the salt-bridges formed between R426 and ACE2-E329 in case of SARS-CoV and K417 and ACE2-D30 for SARS-CoV2. In addition, there is no significant contribution from a single mutant to the binding energies. However, these mutations induce sophisticated structural changes that enhance the binding energies. Our results also indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely a lab engineered virus.","Amin, Muhamed; Sorour, Mariam K.; Kasry, Amal",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02158v1.pdf,697

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of the CORONADO study on 2449 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) hospitalized for COVID-19 in 68 French centres. The composite primary endpoint combined tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation and death within 7 days of admission. Stabilized weights were computed for patients based on propensity score (DPP-4 inhibitors users vs. non-users) and were used in multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the average treatment effect in the treated as inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). RESULTS: Five hundred and ninety-six participants were under DPP-4 inhibitors before admission to hospital (24.3%). The primary outcome occurred at similar rates in users and non-users of DPP-4 inhibitors (27.7% vs. 28.6%; p = .68). In propensity analysis, the IPTW-adjusted models showed no significant association between the use of DPP-4 inhibitors and the primary outcome by Day 7 (OR [95% CI]: 0.95 [0.77-1.17]) or Day 28 (OR [95% CI]: 0.96 [0.78-1.17]). Similar neutral findings were found between use of DPP-4 inhibitors and the risk of tracheal intubation and death. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the safety of DPP-4 inhibitors for diabetes management during the COVID-19 pandemic and they should not be discontinued.","Roussel, Ronan; Darmon, Patrice; Pichelin, Matthieu; Goronflot, Thomas; Abouleka, Yawa; Ait Bachir, Leila; Allix, Ingrid; Ancelle, Deborah; Barraud, Sara; Bordier, Lyse; Carlier, Aurélie; Chevalier, Nicolas; Coffin-Boutreux, Christine; Cosson, Emmanuel; Dorange, Anne; Dupuy, Olivier; Fontaine, Pierre; Fremy, Bénédicte; Galtier, Florence; Germain, Natacha; Guedj, Anne-Marie; Larger, Etienne; Laugier-Robiolle, Stéphanie; Laviolle, Bruno; Ludwig, Lisa; Monier, Arnaud; Montanier, Nathanaëlle; Moulin, Philippe; Moura, Isabelle; Prevost, Gaëtan; Reznik, Yves; Sabbah, Nadia; Saulnier, Pierre-Jean; Serusclat, Pierre; Vatier, Camille; Wargny, Matthieu; Hadjadj, Samy; Gourdy, Pierre; Cariou, Bertrand",Diabetes obes. metab,,697

A continuous representation of pressure, along with semi-automated measurement, would serve to improve the efficiency of practice design and analysis, as well as provide additional context to player competition performance. Using spatiotemporal data collected from wearable tracking devices, the present study applied Kernel Density Estimation to estimate the density of players, relative to the ball carrier, at point of skill execution during elite Australian Football training. Two environmental constraints were measured (area per player and number of players) to determine the relationship between these training design manipulations and density. Density was also compared with existing notational analysis measurements of pressure. Results indicated that a higher density on skills was associated with successful skill executions. The opposite relationship was found between notational analysis pressure measurement and skill effectiveness. A strong inverse relationship was found between environmental constraint manipulation and density, whereby increasing field size and playing number decreased the density on skill involvements. The findings offer insight into the continuous measurement of pressure and encourage practitioners to utilize training design manipulations to influence density as a constraint on skills.","Teune, Ben; Spencer, Bartholomew; Sweeting, Alice J; Woods, Carl; Inness, Mathew; Robertson, Sam",J Sports Sci,,697

382141,Distance Education during Covid-19: the Perspective of Slovak Teachers,2020,"PURPOSE: In order to minimize the risk of transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many clinic appointments were postponed to lower patient attendance. Actively calling patients to postpone appointments is a labour-intensive process. We were the first ophthalmic clinics in Hong Kong to use short message service (SMS) to dispatch messages simultaneously to a large number of patients to offer postponement of appointments. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether SMS is an effective method to reduce outpatient attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is an observational study reviewing data on SMS messages sent to all patients attending ophthalmology clinics of a tertiary eye centre in Hong Kong. All SMS were sent at least 5 days before the scheduled appointments. The text message included an enquiry hotline for postponement of appointments and offered drug refill. The study included data from February to April 2020. Two hundred patients were invited to take part in a questionnaire on satisfaction level and reason(s) for appointment rescheduling. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 17,028 SMS were sent. The overall response rate was 23.6%. 14.3% postponed their appointments. This led to an overall 13.9% reduction of clinic attendance. The overall satisfaction was high (96%). The main reason for postponing appointment was worries about infection risk (93.1%). CONCLUSION: SMS was an efficient and cost-effective flow-control method which was well accepted by patients and can reduce outpatient attendance. The time saved can potentially allow healthcare workers to conduct other infection control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lai, Tracy H T; Lee, Monica; Au, Alvin K H; Tang, Heather H Y; Tang, Emily W H; Li, Kenneth K W",Int. ophthalmol,,697

While polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been the gold standard for COVID-19 screening, serological assays detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in response to past and/or current infection remain vital tools. In particular, lateral flow immunoassay devices are easy to produce, scale, distribute, and use; however, they are unable to provide quantitative information. To enable quantitative analysis of lateral flow immunoassay device results, microgating technology was used to develop an innovative spectrochip that can be integrated into a portable, palm-sized device that was capable of capturing high-resolution reflectance spectrum data for quantitative immunoassay diagnostics. Using predefined spiked concentrations of recombinant anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG), this spectrochip-coupled immunoassay provided extraordinary sensitivity, with a detection limit as low as 186 pg/mL. Furthermore, this platform enabled the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in all PCR-confirmed patients as early as day 3 after symptom onset, including two patients whose spectrochip tests would be regarded as negative for COVID-19 using a direct visual read-out without spectral analysis. Therefore, the quantitative lateral flow immunoassay with an exceptionally low detection limit for SARS-CoV-2 is of value. An increase in the number of patients tested with this novel device may reveal its true clinical potential.","Hung, Kai-Feng; Hung, Chih-Hsing; Hong, Chitsung; Chen, Szu-Chia; Sun, Yi-Chen; Wen, Jyun-Wei; Kuo, Chao-Hung; Ko, Cheng-Hao; Cheng, Chao-Min",,,697

DESIGN: Analysis of #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 Twitter data in the Symplur Signals Database between February 1, 2020, and May 1, 2020. SETTING: Social media platform Twitter. PATIENTS: None. INTERVENTIONS: Promotion of the joint usage of #PedsICU and #COVID19 throughout the international pediatric critical care community in tweets relevant to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and pediatric critical care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We collected data on all tweets containing the hashtag #PedsICU in addition to those containing both #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags. Tweets including #PedsICU were shared 49,865 times on six continents between February 1, 2020, and May 1, 2020; between February 1 and March 13, only 8% of #PedsICU tweets included a coronavirus disease 2019 hashtag. After a sharp rise during the week of March 14, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 content has dominated the #PedsICU conversation on Twitter, comprising 69% of both #PedsICU tweets and impressions (p < 0.001). The most commonly used coronavirus disease 2019 hashtag over the study period was #COVID19 (69%). Proportionately, a greater percentage of #PedsICU tweets including the coronavirus disease 2019 hashtag (vs not) had images or videos (45% vs 41%; p < 0.001). In addition, non-physician healthcare providers were the largest group of users (46%) of the combination of #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags. The most popular tweets shared on Twitter were open-access resources, including links for updated literature, narrative reviews, and educational videos relevant to coronavirus disease 2019 clinical care. Concurrent hashtags and words in tweets containing #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags spanned several different disciplines and topics in pediatric critical care. CONCLUSION: Twitter has been used widely for real-time information sharing and collaboration among the international pediatric critical care community during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Targeted use of #PedsICU and #COVID19 for engagement on Twitter is a conduit to combat misinformation and optimize reach to pediatric critical care stakeholders across the globe when rapid dissemination is needed.","Kudchadkar, Sapna R; Carroll, Christopher L",Pediatr Crit Care Med,,697
384812,Black Swan Event: an Evidence from China’s Economics Efects,2020,"The outbreak of the new human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV) continues to increase globally. The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the most used technique in virus detection. However, possible false-negative and false-positive results produce misleading consequences, making it necessary to improve existing methods. Here, we developed a multiplex rRT-PCR diagnostic method, which targets two viral genes (RdRP and E) and one human gene (RP) simultaneously. The reaction was tested by using pseudoviral RNA and human target mRNA sequences as a template. Also, the protocol was validated by using 14 clinical SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. The results are in good agreement with the CDC authorized Cepheid`s Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic system (100%). Unlike single gene targeting strategies, the current method provides the amplification of two viral regions in the same PCR reaction. Therefore, an accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assay was provided, which allows testing of 91 samples in 96-well plates in per run. Thanks to this strategy, fast, reliable, and easy-to-use rRT-PCR method is obtained to diagnose SARS-CoV-2.","Tombuloglu, Huseyin; Sabit, Hussein; Al-Suhaimi, Ebtesam; Al Jindan, Reem; Alkharsah, Khaled R",PLoS One,,697

Among all the sources of noise pollution, the noise generated by road vehicle traffic significantly affects the quality of urban environments. Concerning the recent imposition of COVID-19 societal lockdown, this study attempts to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on the changes in noise pollution levels before, during, and after lockdown phase in different residential, commercial, industrial, and silence zones of the city of Kanpur, India. Utilizing data collected from portable environmental sensors, the average noise levels before lockdown and during lockdown were found to be in the range of 44.85 dB to 79.57 dB and 38.55 dB to 57.79 dB, respectively, for different zones. Although a significant reduction in the noise levels was observed during lockdown, except for commercial zone, all other monitoring stations had reported sound levels quite higher than the recommended noise limits set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India. Results further indicated that the impact of road traffic noise on risk of high annoyance and sleep disturbance was found to be lower during lockdown as compared to that of pre-lockdown and unlock phase. While the annoyance level in residential (86.23%), industrial (87.44%), and silence (84.47%) was higher in pre-lockdown period, it reduced to 41.25, 50.28, and 43.07% in the lockdown phase. Even the risk of sleep disturbance in the residential zone was found to reduce from 37.96% during pre-lockdown to 14.72% during lockdown phase. Several noise mitigation strategies are also proposed, which may indeed pave the way for devising noise control measures in the local and regional level.","Mishra, Anirudh; Das, Sanhita; Singh, Deepesh; Maurya, Akhilesh Kumar",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

386057,Changes in Gross Anatomy Laboratory Assessment During Covid-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Silent coronary heart disease is frequently undetected in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and pre diabetes determined by glucose intolerance (GI). Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) have been considered markers of cardiovascular mortality, coronary heart disease and chronic renal failure. AIMS: To evaluate the incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and the relationship between urinary albumin-creatinine ratio, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and PWV in type 2 DM with silent CAD. METHODS: We analyzed 92 individuals (44 male), 49 (60±7y) type 2 DM non-insulin dependents and 43 prediabetics (43±4y), with Grade I-II hypertension and no symptoms of CAD. All type 2 DM patients were under antidiabetic treatment with an A1C hemoglobin between 5.5 and 6.5%. Every patient underwent a myocardial perfusion SPECT scan. In those subjects with ischemic patterns, a coronary angiography was performed. In addition, a PWV, glomerular filtration rate, and ACR were evaluated. STATISTICS: mean±SEM, and ANOVA among groups. RESULTS: 48.59% of DM2 and 25.58% of GI patients had silent coronary artery disease. DM2 and GI patients with CAD had higher ACR and PWV and reduced GFR. DM2 and GI showed a negative relationship between GFR and ACR. Moreover, this relation was also observed in different levels of GFR (>60 ml/min and <60ml.min (p<0.05) in patients with CAD, suggesting a cardio-renal interaction in DM2. CONCLUSIONS: Higher PWV, lower GFR and ACR predict the incidence of CAD in DM2. Dysglycemic individuals also represent a group of higher risk for coronary artery disease with similar predictors showed in DM2. Diabetic and prediabetics, still develop renal microalbuminuria. Thus, PWV seems to represent a reliable marker of renal impairment and coronary artery disease.","Sanchez, Ramiro A; Sanchez, Maria Josefina; Ramirez, Agustin J",Current hypertension reviews (Online),,697

Clinical assessment and commonly used coagulation tests are inaccurate and time-consuming. The goal of this practice management guideline was to evaluate the role of the viscoelasticity tests: thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), in the management of acutely bleeding trauma, surgical and critically ill patients. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analyses of manuscripts comparing TEG/ROTEM to non-TEG/ROTEM-guided blood products transfusions strategies were performed. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was applied to assess the level of evidence and create recommendations for TEG/ROTEM-guided blood product transfusions in adult trauma, surgical, and critically ill patients. RESULTS: Utilizing TEG/ROTEM-guided blood transfusions in acutely bleeding trauma, surgical, and critically ill patients was associated with a tendency to fewer blood product transfusions in all populations. TEG/ROTEM-guided transfusions were associated with a reduced number of additional invasive hemostatic interventions (angioembolic, endoscopic, or surgical) in surgical patients. TEG/ROTEM -guided transfusions were associated with a reduction in mortality in trauma patients. CONCLUSION: In patients with ongoing hemorrhage and concern for coagulopathy, we conditionally recommend using TEG/ROTEM-guided transfusions, compared with traditional coagulation parameters, to guide blood component transfusions in each of the following three groups: adult trauma patients, adult surgical patients, and patients with critical illness.

Development of anti-Trichinella vaccines is prospective to eliminate Trichinella infection in food animal. The aim of this study was to assess the biological properties of a novel T. spiralis trypsin (TsT) and its elicited immune protection against larval challenge. The cDNA sequence of TsT gene was cloned and expressed. Western blotting showed rTsT was identified by infection serum and anti-TsT serum. RT-PCR results revealed that TsT gene was transcribed at diverse T. spiralis lifecycle stages. The IIFT results showed that natural TsT was principally expressed at epicuticle of 5-6 day adult worms, indicating that TsT is a worm somatic antigen and adult-stage specific surface antigen. Vaccination of mice with rTsT triggered an evident humoral immune response (high levels of serum IgG, IgG1/IgG2a, and enteral sIgA), and it also induced the systemic and enteral local cellular immune response, demonstrated by an significantly elevation of cytokines IFN-Î³ and IL-4.

387459,Practice makes progress: an evaluation of an online scientist–student chat activity in improving scientists’ perceived communication skills,2021,"The COVID 19 pandemic has caused mayhem globally since the beginning of 2020. Due to the immune dysfunction inherent to cirrhosis and the poor general condition, patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) are at higher risk of mortality and morbidity due to COVID-19. Recently a number of vaccines against SARS-Cov-2 have been granted approval for emergency use around the globe. Although the phase 2/3 trials of these vaccines show them to be safe and effective in the general population, data in patients with CLD is scarce. The number of patients with CLD enrolled into these trials is small; no liver related adverse effects have been reported yet. Various liver societies have come up with guidelines on vaccination in this population and recommend vaccination on a priority basis. Trials to assess the safety and efficacy of the COVID vaccines are under way and are likely to provide valuable insight into this matter.","Sharma, Anand; Patnaik, Itish; Kumar, Ashok; Gupta, Rohit",,,697
387466,The significance of sense in the time of plagues: Curricular responsiveness to the Covid-19 crisis,2021,"The current study investigated cultural and psychological factors associated with intentions to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Participants (n = 704) completed measures of individualism-collectivism, belief in conspiracy theories about COVID-19, feelings of powerlessness, and intentions to engage in behaviours that reduce the spread of COVID-19. Results revealed that vertical individualism negatively predicted intentions to engage in social distancing, directly and indirectly through both belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and feelings of powerlessness. Vertical collectivism positively predicted social distancing intentions directly. Horizontal collectivism positively predicted social distancing intentions indirectly through feelings of powerlessness. Finally, horizontal collectivism positively predicted hygiene-related intentions both directly and indirectly through lower feelings of powerlessness. These findings suggest that promoting collectivism may be a way to increase engagement with efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19. They also highlight the importance of examining the interplay between culture and both personal feelings (powerlessness) and information consumption (conspiracy theories) during times of crisis.","Biddlestone, Mikey; Green, Ricky; Douglas, Karen M",Br. j. soc. psychol,,697

388492,Surviving the COVID-19 menace: A case of higher education sector,2020,"The media has often highlighted the devastating toll COVID-19 has taken in many parts of Indian country--and that, to be sure, is part of the story. But there are other aspects of the picture as well. On the one hand, tribes have taken resourceful and creative measures to combat COVID-19. On the other, a troublesome doctrinal landscape has complicated their efforts to do so. The judicially crafted Montana framework severely restricts tribal civil-regulatory power over nonmembers--a particular problem during the COVID-19 pandemic, when nonmembers have defied tribal curfews, camped in prohibited areas, and opened businesses on reservations despite closure orders. While Montana nominally contains a ""health and welfare"" exception allowing tribes to exercise power over nonmembers in emergencies, its contours are too ambiguous and fact-specific to allow tribes to act with the certainty and speed they require. The pandemic thus provides a vivid illustration of the way in which Montana hinders effective tribal governance. Further, the pandemic has occurred at a moment when the Court may be more receptive than it has been in the past to arguments favoring tribal sovereignty--and at a time when many of the concerns about tribal regulation that motivated the Court four decades ago in Montana seem increasingly distant both from current doctrine and contemporary tribal realities. As a result, it is time, at a minimum, for the Court to expand Montana's ""health and welfare"" exception to resemble something closer to the powers states possess to safeguard public health.

So that, to prevent TE can reduce mortality and morbidity. In this context, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between the previous use of warfarin or other new direct oral anticoagulants (OAC) and mortality in patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19 before hospitalization. A total of 5575 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 were hospitalized and started treatment between March 21 and November 30, 2020 were included in the study. The primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality. A retrospective cohort study design was planned. Patients were followed up until death or censoring on November 30, 2020. The candidate predictors for primary outcome should be clinically and biologically plausible, and their relationships with all-cause death should be demonstrated in previous studies. We considered all candidate predictors included in the model in accordance with these principles. The main candidate predictor was previous OAC use. The primary analysis method was to compare the time to deaths of patients using and not using previous OAC by a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model (CPHM). In the CPHM, previous OAC use was found to be associated with a significantly lower mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.42-0.92, p = 0.030). In hospitalized COVID-19 patients, in patients who previously used anticoagulantswas associated with lower risk of in-hospital death than in those who did not.","Gülcü, Oktay; Aksakal, Emrah; Aydemir, Selim; Dogan, Remziye; Saraç, Ibrahim; Aydin, Sidar Siyar; Öztürk, Mustafa; Aksu, Ugur; Kalkan, Kamuran; Tanboga, Ibrahim Halil",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,697
388962,COVID-19: Stay Cool toward Corticosteroids,2020,"Struggling for food in a time of crisis: responsibility and paradox. Responsibility is a useful lens through which to examine the current state of food poverty in the UK in the context of the Covid-19 crisis, noting that this concept contains several paradoxes. Currently, responsibility involves the voluntary sector, the food industry and the state, a situation which the author has been exploring for the last five years in an ethnographic study of food poverty and food aid in the UK. Food aid organizations, especially food banks, have mushroomed during the period of austerity. This reveals the first paradox: namely, that the existence of food banks conveys the message that ‘something is being done’, but in actuality this is very far from being sufficient to meet the needs of either the ‘old’ or ‘new’ food insecure. The second paradox is that at the onset of the crisis, a government which had been responsible for inflicting austerity on the country for 10 years, dramatically reversed some of its policies. However, predictably, this did not change the situation vis-à-vis food insecurity. The third paradox is that the frequent rhetoric invoking the two world wars has not resulted in lessons being learned – notably, the creation of a ministry to deal with food and rationing, as in the Second World War. The final paradox relates to Brexit and its likely deleterious effects on food security, particularly if no ‘deal’ is achieved with the European Union, as seems likely. The voluntary food aid sector, try as it may, cannot possibly assume responsibility for the long-standing and now hugely increased problems of food insecurity. That belongs to the state.","Caplan, Pat",Anthropol. Today,,697

392574,Taxation of Electronic Gaming,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in pregnancy is considered a risk factor for a range of adverse outcomes in the offspring. Studies have indicated increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, dyslexia and ADHD. However, the overall long-term cognitive development of children born to women with SLE has scarcely been examined. In this study, we compare test scores from the Danish National School Tests of children born to women SLE with children of the background population. METHODS: We included all singleton children born in Denmark between 1995 and 2008, who were listed in the Danish National School Test Register (n=738,862). Children born to women with SLE were identified through linkage of national healthcare registers. We assessed the children's performance in the national school tests between 2nd and 8th grade, in reading and mathematics. Information on the mothers' redeemed prescriptions in pregnancy was included in stratified analyses. Differences of mean test scores were derived from linear regressions and compared according to maternal SLE status, and predefined categories of medication exposures. RESULTS: In total, 312 (0.04%) children were born to mothers with SLE. There were no differences in performance in neither reading nor mathematics tests between those born to mothers with SLE and children born to mothers without SLE. When stratifying on medication exposures among children whose mothers had SLE, there was a non-significant tendency towards poorer results among those exposed to hydroxychloroquine and/or immunosuppressants (n=31), compared to those not exposed to these medications. A similar tendency was not observed among children whose mothers received hydroxychloroquine for non-SLE reasons (n=1,235). CONCLUSION: This study indicates no major harmful effect on the child's neurocognitive development from exposure in utero to SLE, hydroxychloroquine and/or immunosuppressants, as measured by school performance.","Knudsen, Signe S; Simard, Julia F; Knudsen, Jakob S; Christensen, Jakob; Laursen, Thomas M; Deleuran, Bent W; Bech, Bodil H",Lupus,,697

In the present study, we have explored the possibilities of FDA approved drugs as potential inhibitors of the coronavirus main protease, a therapeutically important drug target playing a salient role in the maturation and processing of the viral polyproteins and are vital for viral replication and transcription. We have used molecular docking approach and have successfully identified the best lead molecules for each enzyme target. Interestingly, the anti-migraine drugs such as ergotamine and its derivative, dihydroergotamine were found to bind to all the three target enzymes within the Cys-His catalytic dyad cleft with lower binding energies as compared to the control inhibitors (&#945;-ketoamide 13b, SG85 and GC813) and the molecules are held within the pocket through a good number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Hence both these lead molecules can be further taken for wet-lab experimentation studies before repurposing them as anti-coronaviral drug candidates.","Gurung, Arun Bahadur; Ali, Mohammad Ajmal; Lee, Joongku; Abul Farah, Mohammad; Al-Anazi, Khalid Mashay",,,697

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of vedolizumab (VDZ), a gut-selective anti-integrin, on COVID-19 outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. METHODS: Using data from the Surveillance of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for IBD (SECURE-IBD), an international registry of IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19, we studied the impact of VDZ on COVID-19 hospitalization and severe COVID-19 (intensive care unit stay, mechanical ventilation and/or death). RESULTS: Of 3,647 adult patients on any IBD medication in the registry, 457 (12.5%) patients were on VDZ. On multivariable analyses using backward selection of covariates, VDZ use was not associated with hospitalization or severe COVID-19 when comparing to patients on all other medications [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71, 1.1 and aOR 0.95; 95% CI 0.53; 1.73, respectively]. On comparing VDZ monotherapy to anti-TNF monotherapy, the odds for hospitalization, but not severe COVID-19, were higher (aOR CI 1.39; 95% CI 1.001, 1.90 and aOR 2.92; 95% CI 0.98, 8.71, respectively). In an exploratory analysis, VDZ monotherapy, compared to anti-TNF monotherapy, was associated with new-onset GI symptoms at the time of COVID-19, especially among patients whose IBD was in remission. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 outcomes among IBD patients on VDZ are comparable to those on all other therapies. Hospitalization, but not severe COVID-19, is more likely with VDZ monotherapy than with anti-TNF monotherapy. Overall, VDZ appears to be safe in IBD patients with COVID-19.","Agrawal, Manasi; Zhang, Xian; Brenner, Erica J; Ungaro, Ryan C; Kappelman, Michael D; Colombel, Jean-Frederic",J. crohns. colitis,,697

The pandemic has spread rapidly causing widespread devastation globally. Purpose: This review provides a brief understanding of pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis and management of COVID-19 and highlights the current knowledge as well as best practices for orthopaedic surgeons. These are likely to change as knowledge and evidence is gained. Results: Orthopaedic surgeons, like other front-line workers, carry the risk of getting infected during their practice, which as such is already substantially affected. Implementation of infection prevention and control as well as other safety measures for health care workers assumes great importance. All patients/visitors and staff visiting the hospital should be screened. Conservative treatment should be the first line of treatment except for those requiring urgent/emergent care. During lockdown all elective surgeries are to be withheld. All attempts should be made to reduce hospital visits and telemedicine is to be encouraged. Inpatient management of COVID-19 patients requires approval from concerned authorities. All patients being admitted to the hospital in and around containment zones should be tested for COVID-19. There are special considerations for anaesthesia with preference for regional anaesthesia. A separate Operation room with specific workflow should be dedicated for COVID-19 positive cases. Conclusions: Despite the magnitude of challenge, the pandemic offers significant lessons for the orthopaedic surgeon who should seek the opportunity within the adversity and use this time wisely to achieve his/her Ikigai.","Chhabra, Harvinder Singh; Bagaraia, Vaibhav; Keny, Swapnil; Kalidindi, Kalyan Kumar Varma; Mallepally, Abhinandan; Dhillon, Mandeep Singh; Malhotra, Rajesh; Rajasekharan, Shanmuganathan",Indian J Orthop,,697

396767,"As Covid makes clear, statistics education is a must",2021,"The people suffering from coronavirus have to lead unprecedented actions including limiting travel especially using public transportation. Therefore, lockdown measures and social distancing to decelerate the distribution of the COVID-19 has become the new norm. Nevertheless, improvement in the ambient air quality of the cities globally has appeared as a key advantage of this lockdown. There is a lack of research in the field of public transportation mobility and the Air Quality Index (AQI) during the COVID-19 lockdown globally. Consequently, this research aims to examine the overall impact of the public transit usage and ambient air quality, i.e. both AQI and indicatory air pollutants, during the lockdown in 12 countries. Data collections for analysis of public transportation usage and air quality status during the lockdown and one year before this period were carried out utilizing public transportation application Moovit and World's Air Pollution. The results demonstrated that the lockdowns of 12 countries led to dramatically decreased human movements and public transit usage up to -90% until the end of March and it had no major changes until the end of May. In the case of ambient air quality, the average values of AQI in the 12 countries within lockdown 2020 for classes I(AQI:0-50), II(AQI:51-100), and III(AQI:101-150) increased by 12%, 9%, and 13% while for classes IV(AQI:151-200), V(AQI:201-300) and VI(AQI:301-greater) decreased by 10%, 27%, and 3% in comparison with the identical time throughout 2019. The results also indicate that throughout lockdown 2020, in the 12 countries, the percentages of indicatory air pollutants of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, and NO2 were decreased by 16%, 21%, 41%, 48%, and 35% lower than those in the same time in 2019. Mechanism analysis and comparisons highlighted that the lockdowns of 12 countries led to decreased human mobility and improvement in the AQI around the world.","Sahraei, Mohammad Ali; Kuskapan, Emre; Çodur, Muhammed Yasin",J Environ Manage,,697
396829,A fractional-order compartmental model for predicting the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic,2020-07-08,"INTRODUCTION: The outbreak of novel COVID-19 caught the world off guard in the first quarter of 2020. To stem the tide of this pandemic, there was acceleration of the development, testing and prelicensure approval for emergency use of some COVID-19 vaccine candidates. This led to raised public concern about their safety and efficacy, compounding the challenges of vaccine hesitancy. The onus of managing and administering these vaccines to a sceptical populace when they do become available rests mostly on the shoulders of healthcare workers (HCWs). Therefore, the vaccine confidence levels of HCWs become critical to the success of vaccination endeavours. This proposed study aims to estimate the level of vaccine confidence and the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine among future HCWs and their trainers at a specific university in Cape Town, South Africa, and to identify any vaccination concerns early for targeted intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This proposed study is a cross-sectional survey study. An online questionnaire will be distributed to all current staff and students of the Faculty of Medicine Health Sciences of Stellenbosch University in Cape Town, South Africa. No sampling strategy will be employed. The survey questionnaire will consist of demographic questions (consisting of six items) and vaccine confidence questions (comprising six items in Likert scale format). Log binomial models will be employed to identify factors associated with vaccine confidence and intention. The strength of association will be assessed using the OR and its 95% CI. Statistical significance will be defined at a p value <0.05. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been obtained for the study from Stellenbosch University (Human Research Ethics Committee reference number S19/01/014 (PhD)). The results will be shared with relevant health authorities, presented at conferences and published in a peer-reviewed journal.","Oduwole, Elizabeth O; Mahomed, Hassan; Ayele, Birhanu T; Wiysonge, Charles Shey",BMJ Open,,697
396985,Spearheading Education during the COVID-19 Rife: Administrators’ Level of Digital Competence and Schools’ Readiness on Distance Learning (preprint),2020,"Introduction: The world is living through an outbreak of an acute respiratory syndrome caused by a new betacoronavirus known as coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), which has been declared an international public health emergency by the World Health Organisation. Cancer patients are a very special population in this setting since they are more susceptible to viral infections than the general population. Several recommendations have been made on this issue, most of them based on expert opinion and institutional experience. It is essential to gather the evidence available for decision making. Objective: To review the evidence available in order to create a multi-institutional position from the perspective of scientific societies in Argentina involved in the management of cancer patients. Methodology: The review included two phases: 1) search and systematic revision of the medical literature; 2) consensus and revision of the document drafted by national scientific societies involved in the management and care of cancer patients using the modified Delphi method. The final results were presented at a videoconference with all the participants. Also, additional comment and recommendations were discussed. The final document was revised and approved for publication by the members of the panel. Results: The consensus panel included 18 representatives from scientific societies from Argentina who assessed the evidence and then made recommendations for the management of cancer patients in our country. International guidelines (CDC; ASCO, NCCN and ESMO) were considered as a background for analysis, as well as institutional guidelines and an open ad hoc survey administered to 114 healthcare professionals from the scientific societies involved in this study. The recommendations are grouped as follows: 1) general care interventions-training of the personnel, cleaning and disinfection of the hospital premises and patient scheduling; 2) treatment decisions-patient care, surgeries, immunosuppressive therapy, radiotherapy and screening; 3) ethical considerations-optimisation of resources, end-of-life care for critically-ill patients; 4) management of hospitalised patients; and 5) wellbeing of the healthcare team. The general recommendation arising from the study is that the management of cancer patients must adapt to the exceptional pandemic status quo without disregarding treatment or cure options. Moreover, healthcare professional accompaniment of all patients should not be neglected. All healthcare professionals must make a significant joint effort to create multidisciplinary teams to discuss the most appropriate measures for each particular situation. Conclusions: The scientific evidence available on this topic worldwide is in progress. This together with the epidemiologically shifting scenario poses unprecedented challenges in the management of cancer amidst this global pandemic. Furthermore, the key role of the healthcare structural organisation appears evident, such as the drafting of clear guidelines for all the stakeholders, adaptability to constant change and an interdisciplinary shared vision through consensus to provide adequate care to our cancer patients in the light of uncertainty and fast-paced change.","Ismael, Julia; Losco, Federico; Quildrian, Sergio; Sanchez, Pablo; Pincemin, Isabel; Lastiri, Jose; Bella, Santiago; Chinellato, Alejandro; Dellamea, Guillermo; Ahualli, Alejandro; Rompato, Silvana; Velez, Julio; Escobar, Rafael; Zwenger, Ariel; Rosales, Cristina; Bagnes, Claudia; Puyol, Jorge; Niewiadomski, Dario; Smecuol, Edgardo; Nachman, Fabio; Gonzalez, Eduardo; Ferraris, Gustavo; Suppicich, Juan Ramos; Price, Paola; Medina, Luis; O039,; Connor, Juan",ecancermedicalscience,,697
397337,How can we master the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic? The role of planning at social levels,2021,"Infectious diseases are highly contagious due to rapid transmission and very challenging to diagnose in the early stage. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning now become a strategic weapon in assisting infectious disease prevention, rapid-response in diagnosis, surveillance, and management. In this paper, a bifold COVID_SCREENET architecture is introduced for providing COVID-19 screening solutions using Chest Radiography (CR) images. Transfer learning using nine pre-trained ImageNet models to extract the features of Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19 images is adapted in the first fold and classified using baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A Modified Stacked Ensemble Learning (MSEL) is proposed in the second fold by stacking the top five pre-trained models, and then the predictions resulted. Experimentation is carried out in two folds: In first fold, open-source samples are considered and in second fold 2216 real-time samples collected from Tamilnadu Government Hospitals, India, and the screening results for COVID data is 100% accurate in both the cases. The proposed approach is also validated and blind reviewed with the help of two radiologists at Thanjavur Medical College & Hospitals by collecting 2216 chest X-ray images between the month of April and May. Based on the reports, the measures are calculated for COVID_SCREENET and it showed 100% accuracy in performing multi-class classification.","Elakkiya, R; Vijayakumar, Pandi; Karuppiah, Marimuthu",Inf Syst Front,,697

397435,Exiting the COVID-19 pandemic: after-shock risks and avoidance of disruption tails in supply chains,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading worldwide. Severe cases quickly progressed with unfavorable outcomes. We aim to investigate the clinical features of COVID-19 and identify the risk factors associated with its progression. Data of confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and healthy participants were collected. Thirty-seven healthy people and 79 confirmed patients, which include 48 severe patients and 31 mild patients, were recruited. COVID-19 patients presented with dysregulated immune response (decreased T, B, and NK cells and increased inflammatory cytokines). Also, they were found to have increased levels of white blood cell, neutrophil count, and D-dimer in severe cases. Moreover, lymphocyte, CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, NK cell, and B cell counts were lower in the severe group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that CD4+ cell count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and D-dimer were risk factors for severe cases. Both CT score and clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) were associated with disease severity. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis has shown that all these parameters and scores had quite a high predictive value. Immune dysfunction plays critical roles in disease progression. Early and constant surveillance of complete blood cell count, T lymphocyte subsets, coagulation function, CT scan and CPIS was recommended for early screening of severe cases.","Song, Cong-Ying; Xu, Jia; He, Jian-Qin; Lu, Yuan-Qiang",Sci Rep,,697

Here, serum of Beta variant infected patients revealed reduced cross-neutralization of non-VOC virus. From these patients, we isolated Beta-specific and cross-reactive receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibodies. The Beta-specificity results from recruitment of novel VOC-specific clonotypes and accommodation of VOC-defining amino acids into a major non-VOC antibody class that is normally sensitive to these mutations. The Beta-elicited cross-reactive antibodies share genetic and structural features with non-VOC-elicited antibodies, including a public VH1-58 clonotype targeting the RBD ridge independent of VOC mutations. These findings advance our understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 shaped by antigenic drift with implications for design of next-generation vaccines and therapeutics.

398659,Views of Sports Sciences Students about Distance Education during COVID-19: SWOT Analysis,2021,"Patient care often refers to the broad spectrum of care, prevention, and treatment that a provider delivers, while the point of a differential diagnosis is to make a distinction between 2 or more conditions that share similar signs or symptoms. A broad differential should be considered for every single patient who is currently ill (eg, all patients with respiratory illnesses); without it, there will likely be an increase of misdiagnosis, unnecessary patient suffering, and an influx of patients to the emergency department. The COVID-19 response has forced many of these basic medical values aside, like providing differential diagnosis or practicing bedside manner through social interaction, while physicians struggle to continue care for patients. As a result, newly formed hospital and clinical policies may have dangerously traded everyday diagnosis and treatment of patients for the pandemic and quarantine recommendations. This type of assumptive medicine is based on a singular differential that can be detrimental to patients, who are more likely affected with more common illnesses, like bronchitis or pneumonia-or perhaps, even more threatening illnesses, like a pulmonary embolism, COPD exacerbation, congestive heart failure and even lung cancer. Although these new policies and reactions to COVID-19 are proactive, these actions could be at the cost of providing quality patient care for people who have not contracted COVID-19.","Zolnikov, Tessa; Zolnikov, Tara Rava",J Prim Care Community Health,,697

We investigated the epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory findings of COVID-19 infected patients to identify the effective indicators correlated with the disease. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at King Abdullah Hospital in Bisha Province, Saudi Arabia, from March 20 to June 30, 2020. Patients of different age groups were confirmed as having COVID-19 infection using a real-time polymerase chain reaction. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of the patients were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 132 patients, 85 were male and 47 were female, with a mean age of 50.9 years (SD±16.7). The patients were elderly (n = 29) and adults (n = 103). Of these, 54 (40.9%) had comorbidities, (25%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 12 (9.1%) died. On admission, the main clinical manifestations were fever (84.1%), cough (64.4%), shortness of breath (25%), chest pain (20.5%), and fatigue (18.2%). In all patients, increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes were observed. Patients' lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated. C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated in 48.5%, D-dimer in 43.2%, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in 40.9% of patients. The elderly showed higher neutrophil (p = 0.011) and lower lymphocyte (p = 0.009) counts than adults. Glucose, creatine kinase-MB, LDH, bilirubin, D-dimer, and ESR were significantly higher in the elderly than in the adults. The COVID-19 death group had a higher leucocyte count (p = 0.036), and higher urea (p = 0.029) and potassium (p = 0.022) than the recovered group but had a lower hemoglobin concentration (p = 0.018). A significant association was determined between COVID-19 death and the presence of cardiovascular disease (&#967;2(1) = 16.297, p<0.001), hypertension (&#967;2(1) = 12.034, p = 0.001), renal failure (&#967;2(1) = 3.843, p = 0. 05), old age (t (130) = 4.9, p <0.001), and ICU admission (&#967;2(1) = 17.6 (1), p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Investigating some of the laboratory and clinical parameters could help assess the disease progression, risk of mortality, and follow up patients who could progress to a fatal condition.","Ibrahim, Mutasim E; Al-Aklobi, Obaid S; Abomughaid, Mosleh M; Al-Ghamdi, Mushabab A",PLoS One,,697
400065,Breast Reconstruction in the Social Media Age,2020,"PURPOSE: During the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, governmental regulations resulted in a lockdown for adults as well as children/adolescents. Schools were closed and contact with other people was limited. In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we aimed to investigate the mental/social health of children/adolescents during COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: Two representative samples of Dutch children/adolescents (8-18 years) before COVID-19 (2018, N = 2401) and during lockdown (April 2020, N = 844) were compared on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) domains: global health, peer relationships, anxiety, depressive symptoms, anger, sleep-related impairment by linear mixed models and calculating relative risks (RR (95% CI)) for the proportion of severe scores. Variables associated with worse mental/social health during COVID-19 were explored through multivariable regression models. The impact of COVID-19 regulations on the daily life of children was qualitatively analyzed. RESULTS: Participants reported worse PROMIS T-scores on all domains during COVID-19 lockdown compared to before (absolute mean difference range 2.1-7.1 (95% CI 1.3-7.9). During lockdown, more children reported severe Anxiety (RR = 1.95 (1.55-2.46) and Sleep-Related Impairment (RR = 1.89 (1.29-2.78) and fewer children reported poor Global Health (RR = 0.36 (0.20-0.65)). Associated factors with worse mental/social health were single-parent family, &#8805; three children in the family, negative change in work situation of parents due to COVID-19 regulations, and a relative/friend infected with COVID-19. A large majority (> 90%) reported a negative impact of the COVID-19 regulations on daily life.

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: This article reviews the efficacy and safety of revefenacin, the first once-daily, long-acting muscarinic antagonist, when delivered via a standard jet nebulizer in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). SUMMARY: Revefenacin 175 µg is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with moderate to very severe COPD. Preclinical studies showed that revefenacin is a potent and selective antagonist with similar affinity for the different subtypes of muscarinic receptor (M1-M5). Furthermore, prevention of methacholine- and acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstrictive effects was dose dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours, demonstrating a long duration of action. In phase 2 and 3 trials, treatment with revefenacin was demonstrated to result in statistical improvements in pulmonary function (&#8805;100 mL, P < 0.05) vs placebo, including among patients with markers of more severe disease and those who received concomitant long-acting ß-agonists or long-acting ß-agonists together with inhaled corticosteroids. Revefenacin was also demonstrated to have efficacy similar to that of tiotropium. The clinical trial findings indicated no significant difference between revefenacin and tiotropium with regard to rates of adverse events. Overall, revefenacin was well tolerated, with COPD worsening/exacerbation, dyspnea, headache, and cough among the most common adverse events noted in the clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Revefenacin treatment delivered via nebulization led to improvements in lung function in patients with COPD. It was also generally well tolerated with no major safety concerns. Revefenacin provides a viable treatment option for patients with COPD and may be a suitable alternative for those with conditions that may impair proper use of traditional handheld inhalers.","Hvisdas, Christopher",Am. j. health system pharm,,697

Several studies have examined the potential properties of pomegranate on RA with some uncertain mechanisms suggested. This review aimed to systematically review the available evidence in this regard. METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, WOS, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase and a search engine Google Scholar were searched until March 2020 and search alert services have been applied to identify related articles published after the initial search. There was no limitation regarding language or publication date. Relevant clinical, animal and in vitro studies were chosen. Review papers, conference abstracts, book chapters and articles regarding the effects of pomegranate in combination with other plants as well as articles regarding the effects of pomegranate on other illnesses were deleted. RESULTS: Twelve papers were considered in current systematic review. Human, animal and in vitro studies indicated the beneficial effects of pomegranate on clinical symptoms, inflammatory and oxidative factors in RA. Pomegranate is capable to manage RA complications by reducing the inflammation and oxidative stress. No critical unfavourable results following pomegranate consumption were reported. CONCLUSION: This paper gives compelling evidence regarding the efficacy of pomegranate in RA and justifies the significance of further clinical researches.","Malek Mahdavi, Aida; Seyedsadjadi, Neda; Javadivala, Zeinab",Int J Clin Pract,,697

404632,Use of Information Communication Technology by Medical Educators Amid COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond,2020,"Contributions: The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)-Jockey Club AI for the Future Project (AI4Future) co-created an AI curriculum for pre-tertiary education and evaluated its efficacy. While AI is conventionally taught in tertiary level education, our co-creation process successfully developed the curriculum that has been used in secondary school teaching in Hong Kong and received positive feedback. Background: AI4Future is a cross-sector project that engages five major partners - CUHK Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Education, Hong Kong secondary schools, the government and the AI industry. A team of 14 professors with expertise in engineering and education collaborated with 17 principals and teachers from 6 secondary schools to co-create the curriculum. This team formation bridges the gap between researchers in engineering and education, together with practitioners in education context. Research Questions: What are the main features of the curriculum content developed through the co-creation process? Would the curriculum significantly improve the students perceived competence in, as well as attitude and motivation towards AI? What are the teachers perceptions of the co-creation process that aims to accommodate and foster teacher autonomy? Methodology: This study adopted a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods and involved 335 student participants. Findings: 1) two main features of learning resources, 2) the students perceived greater competence, and developed more positive attitude to learn AI, and 3) the co-creation process generated a variety of resources which enhanced the teachers knowledge in AI, as well as fostered teachers autonomy in bringing the subject matter into their classrooms.","Chiu, Thomas K.F.; Meng, Helen; Chai, Ching-Sing; King, Irwin; Wong, Savio; Yam, Yeung",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07570v1.pdf,697

406175,Application of integrative medicine protocols in treatment of coronavirus disease 2019/ 中西医结合治疗新型冠状病毒肺炎的应用分析,2020,"Purpose of Review: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a complex interplay between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) dynamics and host immune responses. Hosts with altered immunity, including solid organ transplant recipients, may be at increased risk of complications and death due to COVID-19. A synthesis of the available data on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection is needed to inform therapeutic and preventative strategies in this special population. Recent Findings: Few studies have directly compared immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 between transplant recipients and the general population. Like non-transplant patients, transplant recipients mount an exuberant inflammatory response following initial SARS-CoV2 infection, with IL-6 levels correlating with disease severity in some, but not all studies. Transplant recipients display anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and activated B cells in a time frame and magnitude similar to non-transplant patients-limited data suggest these antibodies can be detected within 15 days of symptom onset and may be durable for several months. CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphopenia, a hallmark of COVID-19, is more profound in transplant recipients, but SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells can be detected among patients with both mild and severe disease. Summary: The limited available data indicate that immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are similar between transplant recipients and the general population, but no studies have been sufficiently comprehensive to understand nuances between organ types or level of immunosuppression to meaningfully inform individualized therapeutic decisions. The ongoing pandemic provides an opportunity to generate higher-quality data to support rational treatment and vaccination strategies in this population.","Phadke, Varun K; Scanlon, Nicholas; Jordan, Stanley C; Rouphael, Nadine G",Curr Transplant Rep,,697

Technique: This technique is demonstrated in a patient with residual aortic dissection after replacement of the ascending aorta for acute type A aortic dissection. He presented 4 years later with aneurysmal degeneration of the thoracoabdominal aorta and a proximal tear located in the aortic arch. A 2-stage hybrid approach was devised to treat the patient. An axilloaxillary crossover graft (left to right) with plug occlusion of the innominate artery was performed initially. Later, a dual-branched custom-made device was implanted. To avoid an additional LCCA cutdown for retrograde branch access, an 18-F steerable sheath was used through a percutaneous femoral access. Two wires were delivered within the steerable sheath: the first one was directed into the left subclavian artery to stabilize the sheath position in the ascending aorta; the second wire was used to catheterize the first inner branch and the LCCA to deploy the covered bridging stent. Conclusion: Transfemoral access to catheterize antegrade branches for supra-aortic vessels is feasible using a large steerable sheath in branched endovascular arch repair.","Settembrini, Alberto M; Kölbel, Tilo; Rohlffs, Fiona; Eleshra, Ahmed; Debus, E Sebastian; Panuccio, Giuseppe",J Endovasc Ther,,697

Herein, we conducted a review of the literature of the influenza pandemics of the 20th century; and of the coronavirus and influenza pandemics of the 21st century. Influenza and coronavirus pandemics are zoonoses that spread rapidly in consistent seasonal patterns during an initial wave of infection and subsequent waves of spread. For all of their differences in the state of available medical technologies, global population changes, and social and geopolitical factors surrounding each pandemic, there are remarkable similarities among them. While vaccination of high-risk groups is advocated as an instrumental mode of interrupting pandemics, non-pharmacological interventions including avoidance of mass gatherings, school closings, case isolation, contact tracing, and the implementation of infection prevention strategies in healthcare settings represent the cornerstone to halting transmission. In conjunction with lessons learned from previous pandemics, the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes the basis for delineating best practices to confront future pandemics.","Mujica, Graciela; Sternberg, Zane; Solis, Jamie; Wand, Taylor; Carrasco, Peter; Henao-Martínez, Andrés F; Franco-Paredes, Carlos",,,697

In this report, we describe the clinical characteristics, presentations, clinical course, and outcomes of ESKD patients on PD hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: We describe the characteristics, presentation, and outcomes of adult ESKD patients on chronic PD hospitalized with CO-VID-19 in our 13 major hospitals in the NY health system using descriptive statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of 419 hospitalized patients with ESKD, 11 were on chronic PD therapy (2.6%). Among those 11, 3 patients required mechanical ventilation, 2 of whom died. Of the entire cohort, 9 of the 11 patients (82%) were discharged alive. While fever was a common presentation, more than half of our patients also presented with diarrhea. Interestingly, 3 patients were diagnosed with culture-negative peritonitis during their hospitalization. Seven patients reported positive SARS-CoV-2 exposure from a member of their household. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized patients on PD with COVID-19 had a relatively mild course, and majority of them were discharged home.","Sachdeva, Mala; Uppal, Nupur N; Hirsch, Jamie S; Ng, Jia H; Malieckal, Deepa; Fishbane, Steven; Jhaveri, Kenar D",Am J Nephrol,,697

In addition to the development of therapeutics and vaccines, the evaluation of the sequelae in recovered patients is also important. Recent studies have indicated that COVID-19 has the ability to infect intestinal tissues and to trigger alterations of the gut microbiota. However, whether these changes in gut microbiota persist into the recovery stage remains largely unknown. Here, we recruited seven healthy Chinese men and seven recovered COVID-19 male patients with an average of 3-months after discharge and analyzed their fecal samples by 16S rRNA sequencing analysis to identify the differences in gut microbiota. Our results suggested that the gut microbiota differed in male recovered patients compared with healthy controls, in which a significant difference in Chao index, Simpson index, and β-diversity was observed. And the relative abundance of several bacterial species differed clearly between two groups, characterized by enrichment of opportunistic pathogens and insufficiency of some anti-inflammatory bacteria in producing short chain fatty acids. The above findings provide preliminary clues supporting that the imbalanced gut microbiota may not be fully restored in recovered patients, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring of gut health in people who have recovered from COVID-19.","Tian, Y.; Sun, K.

The survey was completed by nurses, midwives, doctors and allied health (AH) staff between 15 May and 10 June 2020. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 items (DASS-21) assessed the psychological well-being of respondents in the previous week.ResultsIn all, 668 people responded to the survey (nurses/midwives, n=391; doctors, n=138; AH staff, n=139). Of these, 108 (16.2%) had direct contact with people with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Approximately one-quarter of respondents reported symptoms of psychological distress. Between 11% (AH staff) and 29% (nurses/midwives) had anxiety scores in the mild to extremely severe ranges. Nurses and midwives had significantly higher anxiety scores than doctors (P<0.001) and AH staff (P<0.001). Direct contact with people with a COVID-19 diagnosis (P<0.001) and being a nurse or midwife (P<0.001) were associated with higher anxiety scores. Higher ratings of the health service's pandemic response and staff support strategies were protective against depression (P<0.001), anxiety (P<0.05) and stress (P<0.001).ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on the psychological well-being of hospital clinical staff, particularly nurses and midwives. Staff would benefit from (additional) targeted supportive interventions during the current and future outbreaks of infectious diseases.What is known about the topic?The outbreak of COVID-19 is having, and will have, a considerable effect on health services. No Australian data about the effect of COVID-19 on the psychological well-being of hospital clinical staff are available.What does this paper add?Australia healthcare providers have experienced considerable emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly nurses and midwives and clinical staff who have had direct contact with people with a COVID-19 diagnosis. In this study, nurses and midwives had significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression and stress during the pandemic than general Australian adult population norms, and significantly more severe anxiety symptoms than medical and AH staff. Despite a lower number of COVID-19 cases and a lower death rate than in other countries, the proportion of Australian hospital clinical staff experiencing distress is similar to that found in other countries.What are the implications for practitioners?Targeted well-being interventions are required to support hospital clinical staff during the current and future outbreaks of infectious diseases and other 'crises' or adverse events.","Holton, Sara; Wynter, Karen; Trueman, Melody; Bruce, Suellen; Sweeney, Susan; Crowe, Shane; Dabscheck, Adrian; Eleftheriou, Paul; Booth, Sarah; Hitch, Danielle; Said, Catherine M; Haines, Kimberley J; Rasmussen, Bodil",,,697

413507,COVID-19 is the only issue that will matter in 2021,2021,"To investigate the effect of villagers' moral obligation and village cadres' public leadership on villagers' collective action for epidemic prevention and control, against the background of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency in China, we constructed models based on the institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework and employed principal component analysis (PCA) and ordered probit regression, drawing on survey data from 533 villagers in Henan province adjacent to the COVID-19 origin province, Hubei, China. The results indicate that: (1) generally, both moral obligation and public leadership as well as their constituent indicators contributed positively to collective action for COVID-19 prevention and control;(2) moreover, moral obligation and public leadership can strengthen each other's positive role in collective action for COVID-19 prevention and control. Based on the above findings, this paper suggests that villagers' moral obligation can be perfected through internalizing epidemic prevention and control norms into the villagers' moral norms by the way of villagers mastering the rural public health governance scheme. In addition, public leadership can be improved through professional training of village cadres and by motivating village elites to run for village cadres. With improved villagers' moral obligation and village cadres' public leadership, collective action for epidemic prevention and control could be more likely to be realized.","Yang, Liu Ren Yang",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,697

414169,Pandemic and the performing arts in New Zealand,2021,"Background: In times of global public health emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses stand at the front line, working in close contact with infected individuals. Being actively engaged in fighting against COVID-19 exposes nurses to a high risk of being infected but can also have a serious impact on their mental health, as they are faced with excessive workload and emotional burden in many front-line operating contexts. Purpose: The aim of the study is to analyze how risk factors such as perceived impact, preparedness to the pandemic, and worries were associated with mental health outcomes (crying, rumination and stress) in nurses. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was performed via an online questionnaire survey. Participants included 894 registered nurses from Italy. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. Multiple binary logistic regression was carried out to analyze the relationship between risk factors and health outcomes. Results: Increased job stress was related to higher levels of rumination about the pandemic (OR = 4.04, p < 0.001), job demand (OR = 2.00, p < 0.001), impact on job role (OR = 2.56, p < 0.001), watching coworkers crying at work (OR = 1.50, p < 0.05), non-work-related concerns (OR = 2.28, p < 0.001), and fear of getting infected (OR = 2.05, p < 0.001). Job stress (OR = 2.52, p < 0.01), rumination (OR = 2.28, p < 0.001), and watching colleagues crying (OR = 7.92, p < 0.001) were associated with crying at work. Rumination was associated with caring for patients who died of COVID-19 (OR = 1.54, p < 0.05), job demand (OR = 1.70, p < 0.01), watching colleagues crying (OR = 1.81, p < 0.001), non-work-related worries (OR = 1.57, p < 0.05), and fear of getting infected (OR = 2.02, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The psychological impact that this pandemic may cause in the medium/long term could be greater than the economical one. This is the main challenge that health organizations will have to face in the future. This study highlights that the perceived impact and worries about the pandemic affect nurses' mental health and can impact on their overall effectiveness during the pandemic. Measures to enhance nurses' protection and to lessen the risk of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress should be planned promptly.","Galletta, Maura; Piras, Ilenia; Finco, Gabriele; Meloni, Federico; D039,; Aloja, Ernesto; Contu, Paolo; Campagna, Marcello; Portoghese, Igor",Front Public Health,,697

In this case, the removed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)-adjacent (GBM-A), GBM-peritumor and GBM-central (GBM-C) tissues from a convalescent patient of COVID-19, who also suffered from glioblastoma meanwhile, together with GBM-A and GBM tissues from a patient without COVID-19 history as negative controls, were used for RNA ISH, electron microscopy observing and immunohistochemical staining of ACE2 and the virus antigen (N protein). The results of RNA ISH, electron microscopy observing showed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects some cells within human GBM tissues and SARS-CoV-2 in GBM-C tissue still exists even when it is cleared elsewhere. Immunohistochemical staining of ACE2 and N protein showed that the expressions of ACE2 are significantly higher in specimens, including GBM-C tissue from COVID-19 patient than other types of tissue. The unique phenomenon suggests that the surgical protection level should be upgraded even if the patient is in a convalescent period and the pharyngeal swab tests show negative results. Furthermore, more attention should be paid to confirm whether the shelter-like phenomenon happens in other malignancies due to the similar microenvironment and high expression of ACE2 in some malignancies.","Lei, Jie; Liu, Yueping; Xie, Tianhao; Yao, Guojie; Wang, Gang; Diao, Bo; Song, Jian",Neuroreport,,697

Methods: In this retrospective study, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, complications, laboratory results, and clinical management of the patients were studied from data obtained from 168 individuals diagnosed with an advanced prognosis of COVID-19 admitted in two hospitals in Bangladesh. Results: Individuals in the study sample contracted COVID-19 through community transmission. 56.5% (n = 95) cases died in intensive care units (ICU) during the study period. The median age was 56 years and 79.2% (n = 134) were male. Typical clinical manifestation included Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related complications (79.2%), fever (54.2%) and cough (25.6%) while diabetes mellitus (52.4%), hypertension (41.1%) and heart diseases (16.7%) were the conventional comorbidities. Clinical outcomes were detrimental due to comorbidities rather than age and comorbid individuals over 50 were at more risk. In the sample, oxygen saturation was low (< 95% SpO2) in 135 patients (80.4%) and 158 (93.4%) patients received supplemental oxygen. Identical biochemical parameters were found in both deceased and surviving cases. Administration of antiviral drug Remdesivir and the glucocorticoid, Dexamethasone increased the proportion of surviving patients slightly. Conclusions: Susceptibility to developing critical illness due to COVID-19 was found more in comorbid males. These atypical patients require more clinical attention from the prospect of controlling mortality rate in Bangladesh.","Saha, Ayan; Ahsan, Mohammed Moinul; Quader, Tarek-Ul; Shohan, Mohammad Umer Sharif; Naher, Sabekun; Dutta, Preya; Akash, Al-Shahriar; Mehedi, H M Hamidullah; Chowdhury, Asm Arman Ullah; Karim, Hasanul; Rahman, Tazrina; Parvin, Ayesha",J Prev Med Hyg,,697

By January 2021, number of confirmed cumulative cases crossed â¼104 million worldwide. Till date, no effective treatment or drug is available for this virus. Availability of X-ray structures of SARS-CoV2 main protease (Mpro) provides the potential opportunity for structure-based drug designing. Here, we have made an attempt to do computational drug design by targeting main protease of SARS-CoV2. High-throughput virtual screening of million molecules and natural compounds databases were performed followed by docking. After that, the protein-ligand complexes were optimized and rescoring of binding energies were accomplished through molecular dynamics simulation and Molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area approaches, respectively. In addition, conformational effect of various ligands on protein was also examined through essential dynamics simulation. Three compounds namely ZINC14732869, ZINC19774413, and ZINC19774479 were finally filtered that displayed better binding affinities than N3 (known) inhibitor and formed conformationally stable complexes. Hence, the current study features the potential novel inhibitors against main protease of SARS-CoV2 which might provide an effective therapeutic strategy against COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

415699,Bridging the Radiotherapy Education Gap in Africa: Lessons Learnt from the Cape Town Access to Care Training Programme Over the Past 5 Years (2015-2019),2021,"The authors study the potential spread of infectious disease through passenger encounters in a public transit system using Automatic Passenger Count (APC) data. An algorithmic procedure is proposed to evaluate three different measures to quantify these encounters. The first two measures quantify the increased possibility of disease spread from passenger interaction when traveling between different origin-destination pairs. The third measure evaluates an aggregate measure quantifying the relative risk of boarding at a particular stop of the transit route considering the likelihood of alighting at other stops. For calculating these measures, the authors employ compressed sensing to estimate a sparse matrix planted in the underdetermined system of equations obtained from the APC data. Using the APC data of Route 5 in Minneapolis/St. Paul region during the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors found that all three measures grow abruptly with the number of passengers on board. The passenger contact network is densely connected, which further increases the potential risk of disease transmission. To reduce the relative risk, the authors propose to restrict the number of passengers on-board and analyze its effect using a simulation framework. The authors found that, for the particular test on route 5, a considerable reduction in the relative risk can be achieved when the maximum number of passengers on-board is restricted below 15. To account for the reduced capacity and still maintain reasonable passenger wait times, the authors would then need to increase the frequency of the route.","Kumar, Pramesh Khani Alireza Lind Eric Levin John Transportation Research Board",,,697

There are limited data on populations of COVID-19-infected patients seen by palliative care services. OBJECTIVE: To describe a palliative care population at one New York hospital system during the initial pandemic surge. METHODS: This repeated cross-sectional, observational study collected data on palliative care patients in a large health system seen during the COVID-19 outbreak and compared it with pre-COVID data. RESULTS: Palliative service volume surged from 678 (4% of total admissions) before COVID-19 to 1071 (10% of total admissions) during the COVID-19 outbreak. During the outbreak, 695 (64.9%) of the total palliative patients tested positive for the virus. Compared with a preoutbreak group, this COVID-19-positive group had higher rates of male (60.7% vs. 48.6%, P < 0.01) and Latino (21.3% vs. 13.3%; P < 0.01) patients and less white patients (21.3% vs. 13.3%; P < 0.01). Our patients with COVID-19 also had greater prevalence of obesity and diabetes and lower rates of end-stage organ disease and cancers. The COVID-19-positive group had a higher rate of intensive care unit admissions (58.9% vs. 33.9%; P < 0.01) and in-hospital mortality rate (57.4% vs. 13.1%; P < 0.01) than the preoutbreak group. There was increased odds of mortality in palliative care patients who were COVID-19 positive (odds ratio = 3.21; 95% confidence interval = 2.43-4.24) and those admitted to the intensive care unit (odds ratio = 1.45; 95% confidence interval = 1.11-1.9). CONCLUSION: During the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York, palliative care services experienced a large surge of patients who tended to be healthier at baseline and more acutely ill at the time of admission than pre-COVID-19 palliative patients.","Moriyama, Derek; Scherer, Jennifer S; Sullivan, Ryan; Lowy, Joseph; Berger, Jeffrey T",J. pain symptom manage,,697

Yet, as with other types of crises and emergencies, there have been doubts about the extent to which the public are able to engage effectively with the required behaviour. These doubts are based on outdated models of group psychology. AIMS AND ARGUMENT: We analyse the role of group processes in the COVID-19 pandemic in three domains: recognition of threat, adherence by the public to the required public health behaviours (and the factors that increase such adherence) and actions of the many community mutual aid groups that arose during lockdown. In each case, we draw upon the accumulated research on behaviour in emergencies and disasters, as well as the latest findings in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, to show that explanations in terms of social identity processes make better sense of the patterns of evidence than alternative explanations. CONCLUSIONS: If behaviour in the pandemic is a function of mutable group processes rather than fixed tendencies, then behavioural change is possible. There was evidence of significant change in behaviour from the public, particularly in the early days of the pandemic. Understanding the role of group processes means we can help design more effective interventions to support collective resilience in the public in the face of the pandemic and other threats. We draw out from the evidence a set of recommendations on facilitating the public response to COVID-19 by harnessing group processes.","Drury, John; Carter, Holly; Ntontis, Evangelos; Guven, Selin Tekin",BJPsych Open,,697

Nutrition is an integral part of every person life care, and should also be mandatorily integrated to patient care under the Covid-19 pandemic. It is crucial to understand how the Covid-19 does develop and which risk factors are associated with negative outcomes and death. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to have studies that respect the basic tenets of the scientific method in order to be trusted. The goal of this review is to discuss the deluge of scientific data and how it might influence clinical reasoning and practice. RECENT FINDINGS: A large number of scientific manuscripts are daily published worldwide, and the Covid-19 makes no exception. Up to now, data on Covid-19 have come from countries initially affected by the disease and mostly pertain either epidemiological observations or opinion papers. Many of them do not fulfil the essential principles characterizing the adequate scientific method.

Among these, its role in the innate immune system as a first line of defense against pathogens has received less attention. In asthma, levels of exhaled NO have been utilized as a window into airway inflammation caused by allergic processes. However, respiratory infections count among the most important triggers of disease exacerbations. Among the multitude of factors that affect NO levels are psychological processes. In particular, longer lasting states of psychological stress and depression have been shown to attenuate NO production. The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has caused a pandemic, and with that, sustained levels of psychological stress globally, also adversely affects NO signaling. We review evidence on the role of NO in respiratory infection, including COVID-19, and stress, and argue that boosting NO bioavailability may be beneficial in protection from infections, thus benefitting individuals who suffer from stress in asthma or SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ritz, Thomas; Salsman, Margot L; Young, Danielle A; Lippert, Alexander R; Khan, Dave A; Ginty, Annie T",Brain Behav Immun Health,,697

Several immune cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, eosinophils, as well as T and B lymphocytes, synthetize and release cytokines involved in the inflammatory process. Gender differences in the incidence and severity of inflammatory lung ailments including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis (PF), lung cancer (LC), and infectious related illnesses have been reported. Moreover, the effects of sex hormones on both androgens and estrogens, such as testosterone (TES) and 17ß-estradiol (E2), driving characteristic inflammatory patterns in those lung inflammatory diseases have been investigated. In general, androgens seem to display anti-inflammatory actions, whereas estrogens produce pro-inflammatory effects. For instance, androgens regulate negatively inflammation in asthma by targeting type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and T-helper (Th)-2 cells to attenuate interleukin (IL)-17A-mediated responses and leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis pathway. Estrogens may promote neutrophilic inflammation in subjects with asthma and COPD. Moreover, the activation of estrogen receptors might induce tumorigenesis. In this chapter, we summarize the most recent advances in the functional roles and associated signaling pathways of inflammatory cellular responses in asthma, COPD, PF, LC, and newly occurring COVID-19 disease. We also meticulously deliberate the influence of sex steroids on the development and progress of these common and severe lung diseases.","Reyes-García, Jorge; Montaño, Luis M; Carbajal-García, Abril; Wang, Yong-Xiao",Adv Exp Med Biol,,697

Ag concentrations measured in clinical NP samples (collected in 3.0 ml of media) ranged from less than 160 fg/ml to 2.7 µg/ml. Log-transformed Ag concentrations correlated tightly with CT values. In 35 adult and 101 pediatric PCR-positive samples, the sensitivities were 91% (95% confidence interval, 77 to 98%) and 79% (70 to 87%), respectively. In samples with a CT of &#8804;35, the sensitivities were 100% (88 to 100%) and 96% (88 to 99%), respectively. In 50 adult and 40 pediatric PCR-negative specimens, the specificities were 100% (93 to 100%) and 98% (87 to 100%), respectively. Nucleocapsid concentrations in clinical NP samples span 8 orders of magnitude and correlate closely with RNA concentrations (CT values). The S-PLEX Ag assay showed 96 to 100% sensitivity in samples from children and adults with CT values of &#8804;35, and a specificity of 98 to 100%. These results clarify Ag concentration distributions in clinical samples, providing insight into the performance of Ag RDTs and offering a new approach to diagnosis of COVID-19.","Pollock, Nira R; Savage, Timothy J; Wardell, Hanna; Lee, Rose A; Mathew, Anu; Stengelin, Martin; Sigal, George B",J. clin. microbiol,,697

Process, Outcomes, and Lessons Learned: A Reflection",2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Arrhythmias are prevalent and reportedly, the second most common complication. Several mechanistic pathways are proposed to explain the pro-arrhythmic effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. A number of treatment approaches have been trialled, each with its inherent unique challenges. This rapid systematic review aimed to examine the current incidence and available treatment of arrhythmias in COVID-19, as well as barriers to implementation. METHODS: Our search of scientific databases identified relevant published studies from 1 January 2000 until 1 June 2020. We also searched Google Scholar for grey literature. We identified 1729 publications of which 1704 were excluded. RESULTS: The incidence and nature of arrhythmias in the setting of COVID-19 were poorly documented across studies. The cumulative incidence of arrhythmia across studies of hospitalised patients was 6.9%. Drug-induced long QT syndrome secondary to antimalarial and antimicrobial therapy was a significant contributor to arrhythmia formation, with an incidence of 14.15%. Torsades de pointes (TdP) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) were reported. Treatment strategies aim to minimise this through risk stratification and regular monitoring of corrected QT interval (QTc). CONCLUSION: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 are at an increased risk of arrhythmias. Drug therapy is pro-arrhythmogenic and may result in TdP and SCD in these patients. Risk assessment and regular QTc monitoring are imperative for safety during the treatment course. Further studies are needed to guide future decision-making.","Malaty, Michael; Kayes, Tahrima; Amarasekera, Anjalee T; Kodsi, Matthew; MacIntyre, C Raina; Tan, Timothy C",Eur J Clin Invest,,697
425514,Emerging technologies as the next pandemic?: Possible consequences of the Covid crisis for the future of responsible research and innovation,2020,"The pandemic caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has forced, in many cases, to replace face-to-face consultation with the telematic consultation, in order to reduce the risk of contagion associated with the presence of patients in health centers. This change may represent an opportunity for a different and more effective communication between professionals and patients, allowing better accessibility to medical care and more systematic and comprehensive approach to patients with hypertension and cardiovascular risk. However, organizational tools are needed to facilitate communication between patients and professionals, specifically with the exchange of clinical data by remote monitoring of variables associated with hypertension and cardiovascular risk (blood pressure, weight, height, blood tests ), and allow monitoring of adherence to treatments, lifestyles and risk factors. It would be desirable for this to be carried out by multidisciplinary teams, both from primary care, hospital and community pharmacy, with an adequate coordination of care. This document of the Spanish Society of Hypertension (SEH-LELHA) tries to give the keys to improve the quality of care of telematic consultations of patients with hypertension and cardiovascular risk, provide basic criteria of telematic or face to face attention and systematize their content.

In this study, we use transcriptomics and extracellular flux analyses to investigate the metabolic profiles of primary thymic and in vitro-derived mouse and human thymocytes. Core metabolic pathways, specifically glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, undergo dramatic changes between the double-negative (DN), double-positive (DP), and mature single-positive (SP) stages in murine and human thymus. Remarkably, despite the absence of the complex multicellular thymic microenvironment, in vitro murine and human T cell development recapitulated the coordinated decrease in glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation activity between the DN and DP stages seen in primary thymus. Moreover, by inducing in vitro T cell differentiation from Rag1-/- mouse bone marrow, we show that reduced metabolic activity at the DP stage is independent of TCR rearrangement. Thus, our findings suggest that highly conserved metabolic transitions are critical for thymic T cell development.","Sun, Victoria; Sharpley, Mark; Kaczor-Urbanowicz, Karolina E; Chang, Patrick; Montel-Hagen, Amélie; Lopez, Shawn; Zampieri, Alexandre; Zhu, Yuhua; de Barros, Stéphanie C; Parekh, Chintan; Casero, David; Banerjee, Utpal; Crooks, Gay M",Front Immunol,,697
426146,Heterogeneous Stock Market Reactions to COVID-19: More Hidden Mechanisms,2020,"In any other circumstance, it might make sense to define the extent of the terrain (Data Science) first, and then locate and describe the landmarks (Principles). But this data revolution we are experiencing defies a cadastral survey. Areas are continually being annexed into Data Science. For example, biometrics was traditionally statistics for agriculture in all its forms but now, in Data Science, it means the study of characteristics that can be used to identify an individual. Examples of non-intrusive measurements include height, weight, fingerprints, retina scan, voice, photograph/video (facial landmarks and facial expressions), and gait. A multivariate analysis of such data would be a complex project for a statistician, but a software engineer might appear to have no trouble with it at all. In any applied-statistics project, the statistician worries about uncertainty and quantifies it by modelling data as realisations generated from a probability space. Another approach to uncertainty quantification is to find similar data sets, and then use the variability of results between these data sets to capture the uncertainty. Both approaches allow 'error bars' to be put on estimates obtained from the original data set, although the interpretations are different. A third approach, that concentrates on giving a single answer and gives up on uncertainty quantification, could be considered as Data Engineering, although it has staked a claim in the Data Science terrain. This article presents a few (actually nine) statistical principles for data scientists that have helped me, and continue to help me, when I work on complex interdisciplinary projects.","Cressie, Noel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01892v1.pdf,697

It is necessary to provide evidence on its unprecedented psychological effects to develop effective psychological interventions. The current study aims to determine the anxiety severity level, coping strategies, and influencing factors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic among people aged 15 years and above in Gonabad, Iran. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey via online questionnaires between February and March 2020. We evaluated the anxiety severity levels and coping strategies using the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) and Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations-Short Form (CISS-SF), respectively. Multinomial and ordinal logistic regression models were used to identify the predictors of coping strategies and anxiety. RESULTS: Totally, 500 people completed the questionnaires (response rate: 73%). Of them, 53.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 48.9%- 57.8%) suffered moderate to severe levels of anxiety. More than half of the respondents (52.0%; 95% CI: 47.5%-56.4%) utilized emotional-based or avoidant coping strategies. People with no academic education (odds ratio [OR]: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.41- 3.31) and without physical exercise (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.22-3.33) preferred emotional-based coping instead of problem-based coping strategy. Female gender (OR: 1.60, 95%, CI: 1.13-2.28), underlying medical conditions (OR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.65-3.87), and emotional-based coping (OR: 4.06, 95% CI: 2.76-5.99) were associated with higher severity levels of anxiety. CONCLUSION: The severity of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic was significant among participants. Further attention is needed to enhance the mental health of the vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also identified some factors related to the severity level of anxiety related to COVID-19 that could help formulate better psychological interventions.","Mohammadzadeh, Fatemeh; Delshad Noghabi, Ali; Khosravan, Shahla; Bazeli, Javad; Armanmehr, Vajihe; Paykani, Toktam",Arch Iran Med,,697

The Howard Brown Health organization has rapidly expanded to include COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and linkage to resources since the first cases were identified in Chicago, Illinois. COVID-19 is penetrating the most vulnerable networks in the United States; existing inequities are widening as community resources and organizations have had to place services on hold.Here we address several questions that arise as organizations build capacity for contact tracing, including questions involving the potential impact of contact tracing, stakeholders who could be involved, the timing of contact tracing deployment, and the impact potential for digital technology.Contact tracing is critical at later stages of epidemic decline given the potential for isolated outbreaks as larger events, schools, stadiums, and festivals reopen. Local contact tracing efforts can have other indirect benefits with respect to limiting transmission, such as increasing testing rates and addressing structural barriers through provision of life-saving resources and access to crucial social support.","Schneider, John; Love, Willie; Rusie, Laura; Flores, Ariana; Tadesse, Beth; Hazra, Anu; Munar, David",Am J Public Health,,697

As public health measures require us to take up possibly isolating practices in order to reduce and eliminate the spread of the virus, it is important to develop or take up new forms of prosocial yet physically distant dynamics in order to address the negative psychological impact of these measures. The negative consequences of public health interventions might increase feelings loneliness and isolation experienced within Western industrialized societies. For this reason, teletherapy serves as temporary (and limited) intervention that could ameliorate the psychological effects of isolation. It could also serve as a space for the development of critical consciousness, as people reflect on the sociopolitical and economic impacts these measures have on them, and how they wish to address them. Nevertheless, we also offer an ethical cautionary tale to the application of teletherapy beyond the current emergency pandemic of the COVID-19.","Luiggi-Hernández, José G.; Rivera-Amador, Andrés I.",J.

Though active transportation through bicycling and walking can increase physical activity and thereby positively affect health, factors that influence people's decisions to commute using active transportation modes remain underexplored and often fail to capture equity-related barriers. Increases in active transportation during the COVID-19 pandemic call for a better understanding of these influences. This study examines the commute mode choices of essential workers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA to explore the extent to which active transportation to work is explained by individual, social, and environmental factors and whether active transportation choices reflect inequalities. Methods Drawing on the theory of planned behavior and the social-ecological model, this study utilizes data from an online survey (N = 213) completed between June and August 2020. Bivariate analyses compare respondents who commuted using active transportation modes to those who did not using chi-square and ANOVA tests. A series of logistic regression models using forward stepwise selection, controlling for demographic characteristics and commute distance, identify salient individual, social, and environmental factors associated with active transportation. Results Nearly half of respondents changed their commute mode during the pandemic, most often to limit exposure to COVID-19. The full model, accounting for 54% of variation in active transportation commuting, indicated significantly lower odds of active transportation use among non-white (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.155) respondents and those who reported time constraints (OR: 0.450), concerns about safety from traffic (OR: 0.482), and greater satisfaction with community support for bicycling and pedestrian issues (OR: 0.551) and significantly higher odds among those who reported safety concerns around germs (OR: 1.580). Conclusions Structural and social investments that make bicycling and walking safer commuting alternatives during COVID-19 could protect essential works and contribute to sustained behavior change.

A multicountry study,2020,"Combinations of intense non-pharmaceutical interventions (lockdowns) were introduced in countries worldwide to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Many governments have begun to implement lockdown exit strategies that allow restrictions to be relaxed while attempting to control the risk of a surge in cases. Mathematical modelling has played a central role in guiding interventions, but the challenge of designing optimal exit strategies in the face of ongoing transmission is unprecedented. Here, we report discussions from the Isaac Newton Institute Models for an exit strategy workshop (11-15 May 2020). A diverse community of modellers who are providing evidence to governments worldwide were asked to identify the main questions that, if answered, will allow for more accurate predictions of the effects of different exit strategies. Based on these questions, we propose a roadmap to facilitate the development of reliable models to guide exit strategies. The roadmap requires a global collaborative effort from the scientific community and policy-makers, and is made up of three parts: i. improve estimation of key epidemiological parameters; ii. understand sources of heterogeneity in populations; iii. focus on requirements for data collection, particularly in Low-to-Middle-Income countries.

Methods: All laboratory-confirmed cases with SARS-Cov-2 infection who were hospitalized and monitored in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital were recruited from January 20 to February 10. Results: A total of 275 patients were included in this study. The median patient age was 49 years, and 63.6% had exposure to Wuhan. The median virus incubation period was 6 days. Fever (70.5%) and dry cough (56.0%) were the most common symptoms. A decreased albumin level was found in 51.3% of patients, lymphopenia in 33.5%, and pneumonia based on chest computed tomography in 86%. Approximately 16% of patients (nâ =â 45) had severe disease, and there were no deaths. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease were older, had a higher frequency of coexisting conditions and pneumonia, and had a shorter incubation period (all Pâ <â .05). There were no differences between patients who likely contacted the virus in Wuhan and those who had no exposure to Wuhan. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that older age, male sex, and decreased albumin level were independently associated with disease severity.

Un risque majoré de forme grave a-t-il été identifié chez le patient adolescent AM ? Méthode Nous avons rappelé les recommandations françaises sur le sujet que nous avons complétées par une revue de la littérature internationale via Medline, Google Scholar ainsi que les données de l’organisme américain Center for Disease Control and Prevention Résultats L’évolution des connaissances sur la pandémie a clairement établi un plus faible risque de contamination chez l’enfant et l’adolescent Il n’a pas été montré que l’AM ou faible poids corporel constituaient un risque de forme sévère de COVID-19 À l’inverse, le confinement aggrave la symptomatologie chez au moins un tiers de ces patients Conclusion Au final, il apparaît judicieux de ne pas reproduire la stratégie de retour à domicile précoce chez les adolescents atteints d’AM Les données actuelles appuient la nécessité d’une continuité des soins, ainsi que la poursuite des prises en charges hospitalières quand elles sont nécessaires Background In child and adolescent psychiatry departments, the number of hospitalizations for anorexia nervosa (AN) has been increasing in recent years In the phase of severe undernutrition, these patients may exhibit disturbances in their immune functions Based on this observation, many French practitioners had chosen to avoid long hospitalizations during the first wave of COVID-19 They had in mind a risk of contagion between adolescents, in which infections can be frequently asymptomatic Fear of an increased risk of a severe form of COVID-19 in AN patients has led to early returns home, where they would probably be safer than in our departments Is this strategy still relevant for the second wave? Has an increased risk of a severe form been identified in the adolescent AN patients? Method We have recalled the French recommendations on the subject Then we carried out a review of the international literature via Medline, Google Scholar as well as data from the American organization Center for Disease Control and Prevention Results The evolution of knowledge about the pandemic has clearly established a lower risk of infection in adolescents than in adults It seems that the virus spares this population, most of them remaining asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic Reassuringly, AN or low body weight has not been shown to pose a risk for the severe form of COVID-19 Conversely, the literature reports that lockdown worsens the symptoms of AN (food restriction, hyperactivity) in at least a third of these patients Most of the patients expressed a high level of anxiety during the first lockdown It may even have been difficult for these patients to continue to access care when they were confined Conclusion In the end, it seems wise not to reproduce the strategy of early return home in adolescents with AN Current data support the need for continuity of care, as well as the continuation of hospital care when necessary, while a too rapid discharge runs the risk of destabilizing the patient in an already long and difficult course of care in the usual time","Verley, J.

435644,A Recipe for Social Media Analysis,2021-06-14,"BACKGROUND: There is a compelling need to identify clinical and laboratory predictors of unfavorable clinical course and death in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). A trend towards low lymphocyte count and high neutrophil counts in patients with poor outcomes has been reported by earlier studies. We aim to synthesize existing data evaluating the relationship between clinical outcomes and abnormal neutrophil and lymphocyte counts at admission in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: An electronic search was carried out in PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to identify eligible studies reporting frequency data on neutrophilia and lymphopenia at admission in hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. Pooled odds ratios of clinical outcomes for each parameter were calculated using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies (4,969 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. Lymphopenia at admission was found to be significantly associated with increased odd of progression to severe disease (odds ratio [OR], 4.20; 95% confidence interval [95CI%], 3.46-5.09) and death (OR, 3.71; 95%CI, 1.63-8.44). Neutrophilia at admission was also found to be significantly associated with increased odd of progression to severe disease (OR, 7.99; 95%CI, 1.77-36.14) and death (OR, 7.87; 95%CI, 1.75-35.35). Subgroup analysis revealed that COVID-19 patients with severe lymphopenia (<0.5 x10×9/L) had 12-fold increased odds of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Admission lymphopenia and neutrophilia are associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Regular monitoring and early and even more aggressive intervention shall hence be advisable in patients with low lymphocyte and high neutrophil counts. These variables may be useful in risk stratification models.","Henry, Brandon; Cheruiyot, Isaac; Vikse, Jens; Mutua, Victor; Kipkorir, Vincent; Benoit, Justin; Plebani, Mario; Bragazzi, Nicola; Lippi, Giuseppe",Acta Biomed,,697
435897,The dashboard pandemic,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed enormous challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. The negative impact of COVID-19 is widespread and includes not only people who contracted the disease but also those with chronic morbidities such as diabetes whose care is compromised due to diversion of medical resources. People with diabetes are generally more susceptible to infection as a result of altered immunity. People with diabetes have a worse prognosis from COVID-19 and there is evidence to suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may directly affect pancreatic function precipitating hyperglycaemic crises. In the United Kingdom, one of the most heavily affected countries, guidelines are in place to unify the management of people with diabetes hospitalized for COVID-19. Diabetes services are re-organized to ensure that medical care of people with diabetes is maintained despite resource and other practical constraints. Public health measures including social distancing, hand hygiene and the use of face masks are crucial in containing community transmission of the virus. Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated city in the world, is particularly vulnerable and has in place a stringent containment policy and aggressive contact tracing to ensure public safety during this pandemic.","Luk, A.

436290,The Role of Primary Emission and Transboundary Transport in the Air Quality Changes During and After the COVID-19 Lockdown in China,2021,"Climate change is the variability of the climate system that includes the atmosphere, the biogeochemical cycles (Carbon cycle, Nitrogen cycle and Hydrological cycle), the land surface, ice and the biotic and abiotic components of the planet earth. Significant impact of climate change is seen in the form of rise in temperature called as global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2O) are the primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) mainly responsible for the global warming and climate change. These GHGs have drawn lot of attention due to their significant role in the global warming potential. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested to stop global warming at 1.5oC above preindustrial levels as warming beyond this level might lead to heat extremes, alter insect and plant phenology (Phenological shifts) and more occurrence of vector borne diseases. Climate change is the topic of interest in all fields of life starting from social science and going to the applied science. Global climate cycles and world food production systems are under threat due to the recent climate extreme events. These events include heat waves and change in the rainfall patterns. Thus, risk reduction intervention in the form of mitigation and adaptation is required to minimize the impacts of climate change. Mitigation option includes understanding the present and future components of the climate system and interaction among them through coupled modeling system i.e. Global Circulation Model (GCM). Finally, global issue of climate change could be addressed by taking worldwide cooperation and action and adopting sustainable measures like use of alternative energy sources. The visible benefit on recovery of climate has been seen recently through global lockdown against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Ahmed, Mukhtar",Sci. Total Environ.,,697

These fluctuations usually result from internal dynamics, and many studies have linked them to internal climate modes in the North Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Here, we show that variations in volcanic and anthropogenic aerosols have caused in-phase, multidecadal SST variations since 1920 across all ocean basins. These forced variations resemble the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) in time. Unlike the North Atlantic, where indirect and direct aerosol effects on surface solar radiation drive the multidecadal SST variations, over the tropical central and western Pacific atmospheric circulation response to aerosol forcing plays an important role, whereas aerosol-induced radiation change is small. Our new finding implies that AMO-like climate variations in Eurasia, North America, and other regions may be partly caused by the aerosol forcing, rather than being originated from the North Atlantic SST variations as previously thought.","Qin, Minhua; Dai, Aiguo; Hua, Wenjian",Sci Adv,,697

438355,Is Consent Not a Consideration for Instant Messaging?,2021,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and a target for disease prevention. However, the relationship between ACE2 expression and its clinical implications in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain unknown. Here, we explored the location and expression of ACE2, and its correlation with gender, age and cigarette smoke (CS), in a CS-exposed mouse model and 224 non-malignant lung tissues (125 non-smokers, 81 current smokers and 18 ex-smokers) by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the correlations of ACE2 with CS-induced oxidative stress-related markers, hypoxia inducible factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) were investigated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays identified the cause of ACE2 overexpression in human primary lung epithelial cells. We demonstrated that ACE2 was predominantly overexpressed on the apical surface of bronchial epithelium, while reduced in alveolar epithelium, owing to the dramatically decreased abundance of alveolar type II pneumocytes in CS-exposed mouse lungs. Consistent with this, ACE2 was primarily significantly overexpressed in human bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells in smokers regardless of age or gender. Decreased ACE2 expression was observed in bronchial epithelial cells from ex-smokers compared with current-smokers, especially in those who had ceased smoking for more than 10 years. Moreover, ACE2 expression was positively correlated with the levels of HIF-1&#945;, iNOS, and 4-HNE in both mouse and human bronchioles. The results were further validated using a public available dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and our previous integrated data from Affymetrix U133 Plus2.0 microarray (AE-meta). Finally, our results showed that HIF-1&#945; transcriptionally upregulates ACE2 expression. Our results indicate that smoking-induced ACE2 overexpression in the apical surface of bronchial epithelial cells provide a route by which SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells, which supports clinical relevance in attenuating the potential transmission risk of COVID-19 in smoking populations by smoking cessation.

438783,Beyond Disclosure: Developing Law and Policy to Tackle Corporate Influence,2020,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in childhood and adolescence. Currently, surgery combined with chemotherapy is the main treatment for osteosarcoma. However, the long-term survival of patients with metastatic osteosarcoma is unsatisfactory. Therefore, new treatment methods to improve the prognosis of patients with osteosarcoma are required. The present study aimed to develop nanocarriers with both tumor targeting and reduction responsiveness abilities, and to improve the therapeutic effect and reduce toxicity by loading traditional small molecule antitumor drugs. The tumor targeting peptide-decorated, doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded mPEG-P(Phe-co-Cys) nanoparticles were developed successfully through the ring-opening polymerization of amino acids. The peptide VATANST (STP) can specifically bind with vimentin, which is highly expressed on the osteosarcoma cell surface, resulting in tumor targeting effects. The nanoparticle is core-shell structured to protect the loaded DOX during blood flow. The disulfide bonds within the nanoparticles are sensitive to the osteosarcoma microenvironment, which has high glutathione (GSH) levels. Under the enhanced permeability and retention and active tumor targeting effects, the STP-decorated DOX-loaded nanoparticles accumulated in tumor tissues. High GSH levels can rupture disulfide bonds, resulting in the controlled release of DOX, which will cause necrosis of tumor cells. The characteristics of the synthesized nanoparticles, DOX release profiles in vitro and in vivo, cytotoxicity analysis, animal study, and safety evaluation were performed. The nanoparticles could increase the tumor inhibition efficiency against osteosarcoma and reduce the side effects of DOX to major organs. The STP-decorated mPEG-P(Phe-co-Cys) nanoparticles might be a suitable drug delivery system for DOX to treat osteosarcoma.","Qiu, Renna; Sun, Denghua; Bai, Yuzhuo; Li, Jiannan; Wang, Lizhe",Drug Deliv,,697

This meta-analysis quantifies the prevalence of mortality among (1) diabetic and (2) non-diabetic, and (3) the prevalence of DM, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: Published studies were retrieved from four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and medRxiv) and appraised critically utilizing the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's tool. Meta-analyses were performed using the random-effects model. The measures of heterogeneity were ascertained by I- squared (I 2 ) and Chi-squared (Chi 2 ) tests statistics. Predictors of heterogeneity were quantified using meta-regression models. Results: Of the reviewed 475 publications, 22 studies (chiefly case series (59.09 %)), sourcing data of 45,775 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, were deemed eligible. The weighted prevalence of mortality in hospitlized COVID-19 patients with DM (20.0 %, 95 % CI: 15.0-26.0; I 2 , 96.8 %) was 82 % (1.82-time) higher than that in non-DM patients (11.0 %, 95 % CI: 5.0-16.0; I 2 , 99.3 %). The prevalence of mortality among DM patients was highest in Europe (28.0 %; 95 % CI: 14.0-44.0) followed by the United States (20.0 %, 95 % CI: 11.0-32.0) and Asia (17.0 %, 95 % CI: 8.0-28.0). Sample size and severity of the COVID-19 were associated (p < 0.05) with variability in the prevalence of mortality. The weighted prevalence of DM among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 20 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 15-25, I 2 , 99.3 %). Overall, the quality of the studies was fair. Conclusions: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients were appreciably burdened with a high prevalence of DM. DM contributed to the increased risk of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to non-DM patients, particularly among critically ill patients.

Invasive ventilation was required in seven of 17 children (41%) with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 versus 38 of 56 other severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 positive children (68%), with 77% requiring vasoactive support versus 43%, respectively. Seven children (10%) died. In comparison with influenza children, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 children were older (median [interquartile range]: 10 [1-13] vs 3 yr [1-8 yr]), more often Black or Asian (52% v 18%), higher weight z score (0.29 [-0.80 to 1.62] vs -0.41 [-1.37 to 0.63]), and higher deprivation index (3.3 [-1 to 6.3] vs 1.2 [-1.8 to 4.4]). Comorbidities, frequency of organ supports, and length of stay were similar. Conclusions: This nationwide study confirms that PICU admissions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infections were infrequent. We have reported similarities and differences in sociodemographic characteristics, organ support interventions, and outcomes of children affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 compared with influenza.","Kanthimathinathan, Hari Krishnan; Buckley, Hannah; Lamming, Caroline; Davis, Peter; Ramnarayan, Padmanabhan; Feltbower, Richard; Draper, Elizabeth S",Crit Care Explor,,697

Here, we show that such formulae can also be used for determining the time evolution of the associated number of deaths: for the epidemics in Spain, Germany, Italy and the UK, the parameters defining these formulae were computed using data up to 1 May 2020, a period of lockdown for these countries;then, the predictions of the formulae were compared with the data for the following 122 days, namely until 1 September. These comparisons, in addition to demonstrating the remarkable predictive capacity of our simple formulae, also show that for a rather long time the easing of the lockdown measures did not affect the number of deaths. The importance of these results regarding predictions of the number of Covid-19 deaths during the post-lockdown period is discussed.","Fokas, A. S.; Dikaios, N.; Kastis, G.

DESIGN & SETTINGS: The category, period, and regions selected in the Google Trends were ""health,"" ""15 January-15 May 2020,"" in the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, Italy, and France, respectively. The most commonly searched herbs, foods and supplements (n = 32) during the pandemic were determined from a pool of keywords (n = 1286) based on the terms' relative search volumes (RSVs) within the last five years. Correlation analyses were conducted to investigate associations between coronavirus-related parameters with each keyword's RSV for each country. Selected keywords (n = 25) were analyzed using the gtrendsR package in the R programming language; the ggplot2 package was used to visualize the data, the Prophet package was used to estimate the time series, and the dplyr package was used to create the data frame. RESULTS: Significantly strong positive correlations were identified between daily RSVs of the terms ""black seed,"" ""vitamin C,"" ""zinc,"" and ""quercetin,"" and search queries for ""coronavirus"" and ""COVID-19"" in the USA (Spearman's correlation coefficient > 0.8, p < 0.05), and between the RSVs of the terms ""vitamin C"" and ""zinc,"" and daily search queries for ""coronavirus"" and/or ""COVID-19"" in the UK (Spearman's correlation coefficient > 0.8, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Google Trends can be a beneficial tool for following public interest in identifying outbreak-related misinformation, and scientific studies and statements from authorities and the media play a potential role in driving internet searches.","Günalan, Elif; Cebioglu, Irem Kaya; Çonak, Özge",Complement Ther Med,,697

443311,Integrating GoReact Platform Into Distance Education,2021,"In this work we study the fundamental limits of approximate recovery in the context of group testing. One of the most well-known, theoretically optimal, and easy to implement testing procedures is the non-adaptive Bernoulli group testing problem, where all tests are conducted in parallel, and each item is chosen to be part of any certain test independently with some fixed probability. In this setting, there is an observed gap between the number of tests above which recovery is information theoretically (IT) possible, and the number of tests required by the currently best known efficient algorithms to succeed. Often times such gaps are explained by a phase transition in the landscape of the solution space of the problem (an Overlap Gap Property phase transition). In this paper we seek to understand whether such a phenomenon takes place for Bernoulli group testing as well. Our main contributions are the following: (1) We provide first moment evidence that, perhaps surprisingly, such a phase transition does not take place throughout the regime for which recovery is IT possible. This fact suggests that the model is in fact amenable to local search algorithms ; (2) we prove the complete absence of""bad""local minima for a part of the""hard""regime, a fact which implies an improvement over known theoretical results on the performance of efficient algorithms for approximate recovery without false-negatives, and finally (3) we present extensive simulations that strongly suggest that a very simple local algorithm known as Glauber Dynamics does indeed succeed, and can be used to efficiently implement the well-known (theoretically optimal) Smallest Satisfying Set (SSS) estimator.","Iliopoulos, Fotis; Zadik, Ilias",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05258v2.pdf,697
443753,The Screening of You and Me: Effects of COVID-19 on Counterproductive Work Behaviors,2020,"BACKGROUND: The social identity model of risk taking proposes that people take more risks with ingroup members because they trust them more. While this can be beneficial in some circumstances, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic it has the potential to undermine an effective public health response if people underestimate the risk of contagion posed by ingroup members, or overestimate the risk of vaccines or treatments developed by outgroup members. METHODS: Three studies (two prospective surveys, one experiment) with community-based adults tested the potential for the social identity model of risk taking to explain risk perception and risk taking in the context of COVID-19. RESULTS: Study 1 was a two-wave study with a pre-COVID baseline, and found that people who identified more strongly as a member of their neighborhood pre-COVID tended to trust their neighbors more, and perceive interacting with them during COVID-19 lockdown to be less risky. Study 2 (N = 2033) replicated these findings in a two-wave nationally representative Australian sample. Study 3 (N = 216) was a pre-registered experiment which found that people indicated greater willingness to take a vaccine, and perceived it to be less risky, when it was developed by an ingroup compared to an outgroup source. We interpret this as evidence that the tendency to trust ingroup members more could be harnessed to enhance the COVID-19 response. CONCLUSIONS: Across all three studies, ingroup members were trusted more and were perceived to pose less health risk. These findings are discussed with a focus on how group processes can be more effectively incorporated into public health policy, both for the current pandemic and for future contagious disease threats.","Cruwys, Tegan; Stevens, Mark; Donaldson, Jessica L; Cárdenas, Diana; Platow, Michael J; Reynolds, Katherine J; Fong, Polly",BMC Public Health,,697
443764,[Covid-19: trench warfare],2020,"The occupational hazards of health workers (HWs) in standard work environments have been well defined in both the developed and developing world during routine working conditions. Less defined are the hazards to HWs during pandemics, epidemics, natural disasters, wars, conflicts, and other crises. How do crises affect the infrastructure of medical systems? What are the distinct needs of the patient population during crises? What are the peculiarities of the Crisis Health Worker (CHW)? What are the known CHWs' occupational risks? What are the protective factors? By means of a PubMed search, we synthesized the most relevant publications to try to answer these questions. Failures of healthcare infrastructure and institutions include CHW shortages, insufficient medical supplies, medications, transportation, poorly paid health workers, security concerns, and the absence of firm guidance in health policy. Healthcare needs affecting the patient population and CHWs include crisis-induced injury and illness, hazardous exposures, communicable diseases, mental healthcare, and continuity of care for pre-crisis medical conditions. CHWs' occupational hazards include supply deficiencies, infectious disease transmission, long working hours, staff shortages, financial reimbursements, mental fatigue, physical exhaustion, and inconsistent access to clean water, electricity, and Internet. CHWs suffer from injuries and illnesses that range from immediate, debilitating injuries to chronic, unforeseen effects like mental fatigue, physical exhaustion, anxiety, burnout, and even post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD). Protective factors include personal traits such as adaptability and resilience as well as skills learned through structured education and training.

We previously reported that TRPV1 antagonists such as AMG517 enhanced EM in mice, however, these mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms underlying the enhancement of EM by AMG517, a selective TRPV1 antagonist, in mice. Respiratory gas analysis indicated that intragastric administration of AMG517 enhanced EM along with increasing locomotor activity in mice. Next, to clarify the possible involvement with afferent sensory nerves, including the vagus, we desensitized the capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves of mice by systemic capsaicin treatment. In the desensitized mice, intragastric administration of AMG517 did not change EM and locomotor activity. Therefore, this study indicated that intragastric administration of AMG517 enhanced EM and increased locomotor activity via capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves, including vagal afferents in mice.","Hai, Jun; Kawabata, Fuminori; Uchida, Kunitoshi; Nishimura, Shotaro; Tabata, Shoji",Biosci Biotechnol Biochem,,697

One alarming concern during the pandemic is the rise of racism against Asians all over the world. However, little explored behind media reports are the legacies, tensions and challenges left by imperial domination inherited from the past, especially within the postcolonial regimes in Asia, such as Hong Kong and China. Drawing upon postcolonialism as a critical lens, this article makes perceptible the intractable issues of health politics. Postcolonial challenges shown by COVID-19 include immigration, changing politico-juridical definitions of identity, the legacy left by the Soviet era which poses an obstacle to modernising China's healthcare system, and the boom of birth tourism welcomed by the marketised turn of health and tourism policy in Hong Kong in the post-SARS era. A postcolonial perspective invites health sociologists to scratch beneath the surface of political problems such as racism, and attend to the complex heterogeneity of health politics in the pandemic.","Kwok, Henry",Health Sociol Rev,,697

We assessed the comfort and experience of post-kidney transplant patients with telemedicine versus an in-person visit using a 16-question survey between March and June 2020. Patients completed the survey via email or telephone. Participants graded their experience using a 5-point assessment (1=most positive;5=least desirable). 197 out of 381 telemedicine patients responded. Survey questions were consolidated into 7 groups. Living (1.38) vs deceased donor (1.56, P=0.018) recipients, less than 6 months post-transplant (1.33) vs 1.52 for 6-12 months, 1.56 for &gt;12 months, P=0.033);non-African Americans (AA) (1.36) vs AA (1.60, P=0.002) responded more favorably to ease of scheduling and entering the portal. Non-AA (1.26) vs AA (1.40, P=0.034) rated patient/provider interaction higher. Patients age 50 or less (1.33), 65 and over (1.49) found better quality of the Internet connection with a provider than 51-64 (1.73, P=0.005). Patients &lt; 50 (1.35) and women (1.39) found telemedicine simpler to use than 51-64 (1.66) and over 65 (1.58, P=0.045) and men (1.62, P=0.035), respectively. Patients who lived greater versus less than 50 miles from our center: telemedicine is the same as in person visit (1.99 vs 2.38, P=0.009);an acceptable alternative (1.43 vs 1.74, P=0.009);enjoyed their experience and comfort substituting telemedicine for an in-person provider in the future (2.10 vs 1.76, P=0.03).

446566,The COVID-19 pandemic-implications for the cytology laboratory,2020,"BACKGROUND: The disproportionate burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial/ethnic minority communities has revealed glaring inequities. However, multivariate empirical studies investigating its determinants are still limited. We document variation in COVID-19 case and death rates across different racial/ethnic neighbourhoods in New York City (NYC), the initial epicentre of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, and conduct a multivariate ecological analysis investigating how various neighbourhood characteristics might explain any observed disparities. METHODS: Using ZIP-code-level COVID-19 case and death data from the NYC Department of Health, demographic and socioeconomic data from the American Community Survey and health data from the Centers for Disease Control's 500 Cities Project, we estimated a series of negative binomial regression models to assess the relationship between neighbourhood racial/ethnic composition (majority non-Hispanic White, majority Black, majority Hispanic and Other-type), neighbourhood poverty, affluence, proportion of essential workers, proportion with pre-existing health conditions and neighbourhood COVID-19 case and death rates. RESULTS: COVID-19 case and death rates for majority Black, Hispanic and Other-type minority communities are between 24% and 110% higher than those in majority White communities. Elevated case rates are completely accounted for by the larger presence of essential workers in minority communities but excess deaths in Black neighbourhoods remain unexplained in the final model. CONCLUSIONS: The unequal COVID-19 case burden borne by NYC's minority communities is closely tied to their representation among the ranks of essential workers. Higher levels of pre-existing health conditions are not a sufficient explanation for the elevated mortality burden observed in Black communities.","Do, D Phuong; Frank, Reanne",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,697

This necessitates careful observation, as sleep plays a crucial role in brain maturation and poor sleep increases the risk of psychopathology, particularly in the young population. Through an online survey with one baseline (April 2020) and two follow-up assessments (May and June 2020), we examined the effect of confinement on sleep quality in 452 babies (0-35 months) and 412 preschool children (36-71 months) from several, mainly European, countries. An acute decrease in sleep quality was found in both groups of children. However, at follow-up assessments, this effect rebounded to the level reported for the period before the confinement. Importantly, caregiver's stress level was identified as a substantial risk factor determining lower sleep quality in both groups of children across assessments. Protective factors conserving children's sleep quality included caregiver's engagement in mindfulness techniques or childcare, and the presence of siblings and pets. In the near future, we may repeatedly experience the circumstances of abruptly enforced confinement. Our findings reveal promising pathways of action to protect young children's sleep, with which to essentially mitigate the long-term consequences of the pandemic on brain development and mental health.","Markovic, Andjela; Mühlematter, Christophe; Beaugrand, Matthieu; Camos, Valérie; Kurth, Salome",J Sleep Res,,697

Behavioral Patterns for User Interface Design,2020,"Social distancing has been adopted as a strategy to contain the advance of the pandemic until specific solutions to combat the virus are available. Many economic sectors and social activities need to continue despite the viruses, and most social distancing policies disregard individual choices, resulting in greater or lesser adherence to isolation. In this paper, we characterize the differentiation of access to essential activities within Brazilian cities during social distancing and the intention to maintain behavior changes concerning these activities in the post-pandemic period. The results showed that the behavior regarding essential activities during the pandemic is not independent of variables associated with pre-pandemic travel patterns, isolation conditions, and socioeconomic factors. Post-pandemic intention proved to be statistically dependent on factors associated with the activities' characteristics and experiences during the pandemic. Accessibility-oriented planning can guide urban and transportation policies more equitably through the identification of the most affected groups by activity disruption. At the same time, the incorporation of new routines less dependent on displacement offers opportunities to review public space.","Bracarense, Lílian dos Santos Fontes Pereira Magalhães de Oliveira Renata Lúcia",Transport Policy,,697

RESULTS: The response rate of 42.6% (n = 66), included replies from 23 (34.8%) specialised hospitals, 18 (27.3%) maximum care hospitals and 14 (21.2%) university clinics. COVID-19-positive patients were treated in 65 (99%) clinics and 37.9% of the clinics also performed surgery on COVID-19-positive patients. Nasopharyngeal swabs were the main instrument for COVID-19 patient testing (in 95.4% of the clinics). Test results influenced decisions on treatment in 71.2% of the clinics. In 59.1% of clinics, safety equipment was supplemented with FFP2 masks and eye protection during thoracic surgeries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: Almost all thoracic surgeons reported that they had treated patients with COVID-19 and half of them also had performed surgery on COVID-19-positive patients. The applied procedural instructions as well as the effects of COVID-19 on treatment decisions and patient-doctor contact differed between the reporting clinics.","Dziodzio, Tomasz; Hillebrandt, Karl-Herbert; Knitter, Sebastian; Ritschl, Paul Viktor; Jara, Maximilian; Nösser, Maximilian; Elsner, Aron; Öllinger, Robert; Pratschke, Johann; Rückert, Jens-Carsten; Neudecker, Jens",Zent.bl. chir,,697
449333,Readiness for Online Learning during COVID-19 pandemic: A survey of Pakistani LIS students,2021,"Given the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, investigations into host susceptibility to infectious diseases and downstream sequelae have never been more relevant. Pneumonia is a lung disease that can cause respiratory failure and hypoxia and is a common complication of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Few genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of host susceptibility and severity of pneumonia have been conducted. We performed GWASs of pneumonia susceptibility and severity in the Vanderbilt University biobank (BioVU) with linked electronic health records (EHRs), including Illumina Expanded Multi-Ethnic Global Array (MEGAEX)-genotyped European ancestry (EA, n= 69,819) and African ancestry (AA, n = 15,603) individuals. Two regions of large effect were identified: the CFTR locus in EA (rs113827944; OR = 1.84, p value = 1.2 × 10-36) and HBB in AA (rs334 [p.Glu7Val]; OR = 1.63, p value = 3.5 × 10-13). Mutations in these genes cause cystic fibrosis (CF) and sickle cell disease (SCD), respectively. After removing individuals diagnosed with CF and SCD, we assessed heterozygosity effects at our lead variants. Further GWASs after removing individuals with CF uncovered an additional association in R3HCC1L (rs10786398; OR = 1.22, p value = 3.5 × 10-8), which was replicated in two independent datasets: UK Biobank (n = 459,741) and 7,985 non-overlapping BioVU subjects, who are genotyped on arrays other than MEGAEX. This variant was also validated in GWASs of COVID-19 hospitalization and lung function. Our results highlight the importance of the host genome in infectious disease susceptibility and severity and offer crucial insight into genetic effects that could potentially influence severity of COVID-19 sequelae.","Chen, Hung-Hsin; Shaw, Douglas M; Petty, Lauren E; Graff, Misa; Bohlender, Ryan J; Polikowsky, Hannah G; Zhong, Xue; Kim, Daeeun; Buchanan, Victoria L; Preuss, Michael H; Shuey, Megan M; Loos, Ruth J F; Huff, Chad D; Cox, Nancy J; Bastarache, Julie A; Bastarache, Lisa; North, Kari E; Below, Jennifer E",Am J Hum Genet,,697

450689,COVID-19: Key global impacts on the construction industry and proposed coping strategies,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Essential workers in the United States need access to health care services for preventive care and for diagnosis and treatment of illnesses (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] or other infectious or chronic diseases) to remain healthy and continue working during a pandemic. This study evaluated access to health care services among selected essential workers. METHODS: We used the most recent data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2017-2018, to estimate the prevalence of 4 measures of health care access (having health insurance, being able to afford to see a doctor when needed, having a personal health care provider, and having a routine checkup in the past year) by broad and detailed occupation group among 189 208 adults aged 18-64. RESULTS: Of all occupations studied, workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations were most likely to have no health insurance (46.4%). Personal care aides were most likely to have been unable to see a doctor when needed because of cost (29.3%). Construction laborers were most likely to lack a personal health care provider (51.1%) and to have not had a routine physical checkup in the past year (50.6%). Compared with workers in general, workers in 3 broad occupation groups-food preparation and serving; building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; and construction trades-had significantly lower levels of health care access for all 4 measures. CONCLUSION: Lack of health insurance and underinsurance were common among subsets of essential workers. Limited access to health care might decrease essential workers' access to medical testing and needed care and hinder their ability to address underlying conditions, thereby increasing their risk of severe outcomes from some infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Improving access to health care for all workers, including essential workers, is critical to ensure workers' health and workforce stability.","Boal, Winifred L; Li, Jia; Silver, Sharon R",Public Health Rep,,697
451342,Gender And Self Regulated Learning During COVID-19 Pandemic In Indonesia,2020,"The covid-19 pandemic has significantly altered the organization and scheduling of high schools in Spain. Due to pandemic restrictions, most students from grades 9 to 11 come to class only on alternate days. In this situation, e-learning and distance learning have gained prominence as necessary methods of instruction. In this study 68 students from grades 9 and 10, attending on alternate days, participated in an online teaching experience for the first time in their lives. This took place during the first trimester of the 2020-2021 academic school year. On days when they did not attend class in person, students were expected to watch the mathematics classes which were broadcasted live via YouTube. Students could either watch the classes live and ask the teacher questions via an online chat, or alternatively, they could watch the pre-recorded classes at a later time. The two options were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. Results showed a continuous decrease in the number of students who preferred the first option, switching progressively from online live classes to pre-recorded classes as the weeks passed. The qualitative results explained this progressive decrease as students preferred to watch the teacher’s explanations several times. Although e-learning is absolutely necessary in the 21st century, and especially during the current pandemic, controlling students’ level of application to distance work and online learning is still a challenge. © 2021 by the authors;licensee Asian Online Journal Publishing Group","Moliner, L.; Lorenzo-Valentin, G.; Alegre, F.",Journal of Education and e-Learning Research,,697

453709,Globalization and vulnerable populations in times of a pandemic: A Mayan perspective,2020,"Interconversion between charge and spin through spin-orbit coupling lies at the heart of condensed-matter physics. In normal metal/ferromagnet bilayers, a concerted action of the interconversions, the spin Hall effect and its inverse effect of normal metals, results in spin Hall magnetoresistance, whose sign is always positive regardless of the sign of spin Hall conductivity of normal metals. Here we report that the spin Hall magnetoresistance of Ta/NiFe bilayers is negative, necessitating an additional interconversion process. Our theory shows that the interconversion owing to interfacial spin-orbit coupling at normal metal/ferromagnet interfaces can give rise to negative spin Hall magnetoresistance. Given that recent studies found the conversion from charge currents to spin currents at normal metal/ferromagnet interfaces, our work provides a missing proof of its reciprocal spin-current-to-charge-current conversion at same interface. Our result suggests that interfacial spin-orbit coupling effect can dominate over bulk effects, thereby demanding interface engineering for advanced spintronics devices.","Kang, Min-Gu; Go, Gyungchoon; Kim, Kyoung-Whan; Choi, Jong-Guk; Park, Byong-Guk; Lee, Kyung-Jin",Nat Commun,,697

Methods: Two hundred and thirty-three volunteers were included in web-based open e-survey. The survey was designed on the 'Survey Monkey' website and distributed through social media platform. The information was collected regarding hours and numbers of digital devices along with numbers of digital activities carried out during the pandemic. A pretested symptom questionnaire was also included regarding ocular, visual and systemic symptoms before and during lockdown. The statistical analysis was carried out using Statistical Package of Social Science software. Results: During the pandemic, most of the respondents were engaged in more than two digital activities (73.81%) over more than two digital devices (48.50%) for more than six days (65.66%). Maximum respondents were mobile users (97.85%) spending major time on social media (89.70%). Symptoms including watering eyes (P = 0.000), dry eyes (P = 0.000), shoulder pain (P = 0.020), back pain (P = 0.003) and headache (P = 0.043) showed positive correlation with hours of digital device use per day during lockdown, while itching eyes (P = 0.036) and pain behind eyes (P = 0.025) were the major symptoms in those engaged in a greater number of digital activities. Moreover, red eyes (P = 0.040) were more prominent in respondents using multiple devices for a greater number of hours. Conclusion: A big jump in digital activities on multiple digital devices was seen during lockdown which are more prone to ocular symptoms.

455174,Training in Digital Skills in Early Childhood: Education Teachers The Case of the University of La Laguna,2020,"A corollary discharge (CD) is a copy of a neuronal command for movement sent to other brain regions to inform them of the impending movement. In monkeys, a circuit from superior colliculus (SC) through medial dorsal thalamus (MD) to frontal eye field (FEF) carries such a CD for saccadic eye movements. This circuit provides the clearest example of such internal monitoring reaching cerebral cortex. In this report we first investigated the functional organization of the critical MD relay by systematically recording neurons within a grid of penetrations. In two male rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta), we found that lateral MD neurons carrying CD signals discharged before saccades to ipsilateral as well as contralateral visual fields instead of just contralateral fields, often had activity over large movement fields, and had activity from both central and peripheral visual fields. Each of these characteristics has been found in FEF, but these findings indicate that these characteristics are already present in the thalamus. These characteristics show that the MD thalamic relay is not passive but instead assembles inputs from the SC before transmission to cortex. We next determined the exact location of the saccade-related CD neurons using the grid of penetrations. The neurons occupy an anterior-posterior band at the lateral edge of MD, and we established this band in stereotaxic coordinates to facilitate future study of CD neurons. These observations reveal both the organizational features of the internal CD signals within the thalamus, and the location of the thalamic relay for those signals.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTA corollary discharge (CD) circuit within the brain keeps an internal record of physical movements. In monkeys and humans one such CD keeps track of rapid eye movements, and in monkeys a circuit carrying this CD extends from midbrain to cerebral cortex through a relay in the thalamus. This circuit provides guidance for eye movements, contributes to stable visual perception, and when defective, might be related to difficulties that schizophrenic patients have in recognizing their own movements. This report facilitates the comparison of the circuit in monkeys and humans, particularly for comparison of the location of the thalamic relay in monkeys and in humans.","Cavanaugh, James; McAlonan, Kerry; Wurtz, Robert H",J. neurosci,,697

This study was done as there is scarce data on mortality predictors in severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted to ICU in the Indian population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted to tertiary care center during June-October 2020. The records of patients admitted to ICU were collected and data included demography, symptoms, comorbidites and vital parameters. Laboratory parameters included complete hemogram, random blood sugar, S.Ferritin, S.LDH, renal function test, liver function test. Treatment-associated information such as the use of remdesivir, timing of initiating rem-desivir after the symptom onset, the use of steroids, use of anticoagulants, use of HFNC, NIV, ventilator were collected. 30 days mortality data post-discharge was collected via telephonic interview. RESULTS: 4,012 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were admitted to hospital, of which 560 (13.95%) with severe pneumonia were included in the study. Mean age was 57.75 ± 13.96 years. The mortality rates were 54.64% among severe COVID-19 cases and 5% among mild to moderate COVID-19 cases. The Cox multinominal regression analysis identified SpO2/FiO2 < 400, age > 50 years, duration of symptom > 4 days, serum ferritin > 450 µg/L, respiratory rate > 23/min, the presence of comorbidities and non-usage of remdesivir were independently associated with increased mortality. Mortality rate at 30 days was 56.60%. CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with very high mortality, especially in a resource-constrained setting. The use of remdesivir may have to be considered early in the course of disease to prevent excess mortality related to COVID-19.","Mahendra, M; Nuchin, Abhishek; Kumar, Ranjith; Shreedhar, S; Mahesh, Padukudru Anand",Adv Respir Med,,697

MethodsThis Phase 2, modified double-blind, parallel-group study (NCT04762680) was conducted in adults, including those at increased risk of severe COVID-19. Participants were randomised 1:1:1, stratified by age (18-59/[≥]60 years), rapid serodiagnostic test (positive/negative) and high-risk medical conditions (yes/no), to receive two injections (day [D]1 and D22) of 5g, 10g or 15g of CoV2 preS dTM antigen with fixed AS03 content. Interim safety and reactogenicity results (to D43) and neutralising antibodies (Nabs) against the D614G variant are presented (primary objectives). FindingsOf 722 participants enrolled and randomised between 24 February and 8 March 2021, 721 received [≥]1 injections (5g, n=240; 10g, n=239; 15g, n=242). Four participants reported unsolicited immediate adverse events (AEs), two were vaccine-related (investigator assessment). Five participants reported seven vaccine-related medically-attended AEs. No vaccine-related serious AEs and no AEs of special interest were reported. Solicited reactions (local and systemic) were reported at similar frequencies between study groups; these were mostly mild to moderate and transient, with higher frequency and intensity post-injection 2 than post-injection 1. In SARS-CoV-2 naive participants at D36, 96{middle dot}9%, 97.0% and 97{middle dot}6% of participants had [≥]4-fold-rise in NAb titres from baseline in the 5g-, 10g- and 15g-dose groups, respectively.

459376,Texas Hold'em Engaging Employers to Close the Skills Gap: the Resource for Adult Education,2020,"In responding to the Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, some government policies have been more effective in containing, suppressing, and mitigating the disease than others. Government leaders and public administrators can learn from other countries and adapt these lessons to their crisis management and public health systems. South Korea has emerged as a model to emulate in fighting the pandemic. While South Korea endured devastating early outbreaks, the country flattened the coronavirus curve without paralyzing the national health and economic systems. The author reviews South Korea’s public health policy approaches and the embedded context, by using documents and materials written in Korean and English, to learn how the country managed coronavirus from January through April 2020. The critical factors in South Korea’s public health administration and management that led to success include national infectious disease plans, collaboration with the private sector, stringent contact tracing, an adaptive health care system, and government-driven communication. This article also proposes some key aspects to be considered to transfer lessons from country-level responses in South Korea to other contexts.","You, Jongeun",Am. Rev. Public Adm.,,697

We conducted two questionnaire surveys among these clinics within 17 months and another during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak to assess adjustments of the developing network to the pandemic. Out of 68 HFCs comprising the network, 52 participated in the first survey and 55 in the second survey. The median number of patients assessed per week is 10. Changes in engaged personnel were encountered between the two surveys, along with increasing use of advanced echocardiographic techniques (23.1% in 2018 vs. 34.5% in 2020). Drawbacks were encountered, concerning magnetic resonance imaging and ergospirometry use (being available in 14.6% and 29% of HFCs, respectively), exercise rehabilitation programmes (applied only in 5.5%), and telemedicine applications (used in 16.4%). There are 13 COCs in the country with nine of them in the capital region; the median number of patients being assessed per week is 10. Platforms for virtual consultations and video calls are used in 38.5%. Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak affected provision of HFC services dramatically as only 18.5% continued to function regularly, imposing hurdles that need to be addressed, at least temporarily, possibly by alternative methods of follow-up such as remote consultation. The function of COCs, in contrast, seemed to be much less affected during the pandemic (77% of them continued to follow up their patients). This staged, survey-based procedure may serve as a blueprint to help building national HFC/COC networks and provides the means to address changes during healthcare crises.",,ESC Heart Fail,,697
461324,Crops from U.S. food supply chains will never look nor taste the same again,2020,"Since the advent of protein crystallography, atomic-level macromolecular structures have provided a basis to understand biological function. Enzymologists use detailed structural insights on ligand coordination, interatomic distances and positioning of catalytic amino acids to rationalize the underlying electronic reaction mechanisms. Often the proteins in question catalyze redox reactions using metal cofactors that are explicitly intertwined with their function. In these cases, the exact nature of the coordination sphere and the oxidation state of the metal is of utmost importance. Unfortunately, the redox active nature of metal cofactors makes them especially susceptible to photoreduction, meaning that information obtained by photoreducing X-ray sources about the environment of the cofactor are the least trustworthy part of the structure. In this work we directly compare the kinetics of photoreduction of six different heme protein crystal species at by X-ray radiation. We show that a dose of approximately 40 kGy already yields 50% ferrous iron in a heme protein crystal. We also demonstrate that the kinetics of photoreduction are completely independent from variables unique to the different samples tested. The photoreduction-induced structural rearrangements around the metal cofactors have to be considered when biochemical data of ferric proteins are rationalized by constraints derived from crystal structures of reduced enzymes.","Pfanzagl, Vera; Beale, John H; Michlits, Hanna; Schmidt, Daniel; Gabler, Thomas; Obinger, Christian; Djinovic-Carugo, Kristina; Hofbauer, Stefan",J. biol. chem,,697

On March 23, 2020, the faculty, students, and staff were emailed the following by the university's director of infection control and public health: We have become aware that a Prestigious University staff member has tested positive for the virus that causes Covid-19. The individual, who was last on campus on March 16, is now in isolation at their permanent residence and is doing well clinically. The university has already identified those members of our community who may have been in close contact with this individual, and we are working to notify them. Further, this individual's local health department has a protocol for identifying people who have been in direct contact with anyone testing positive for Covid-19 (such as this Prestigious University staff member) so that they can self-quarantine and watch for COVID-19 symptoms for a period of 14 days from their last contact with the infected individual.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical practices of spine surgeons within the Asia Pacific region. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: COVID-19 pandemic had changed spine surgeons' clinical practices and their concerns toward personal and family risk of infection. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was carried out from May 4, 2020 to June 4, 2020. The questionnaire was administered using REDCAP. The online questionnaire includes four sections. First section includes surgeon's demographics, background, type of clinical practice, and status of pandemic in their country. Second section includes volume and the type of spine surgery practice before the COVID pandemic. Third section includes changes of clinical practice during the pandemic and the last section was regarding their concern on COVID transmission. RESULTS: Total of 222 respondents from 19 countries completed the questionnaire. During the pandemic, 92.3% of the respondents felt their clinical practice was affected. 58.5% respondents reported reduced outpatient clinic hours and 74.6% respondents reported reduced operation theatre hours due to the enforcement by the hospital administration. The mean reduction of clinic volume for all countries was 48.1%. There was a significant reduction in the number of surgeries performed in Japan, Malaysia, India, Philippines, and South Korea. This was due to reduced patient load. More than 60% of respondents were worried being infected by COVID-19 virus and >68% were worried of transmission to their family members. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the clinical and surgical practice of spine surgeons in the Asia Pacific region. Clinics were closed or the practice hours reduced. Similarly, surgical theaters were closed, reduced, or limited to semi-emergency and emergency surgeries. Spine surgeons were moderately concerned of contracting COVID-19 during their clinical practice but were extremely concerned to transmit this disease to their family members.

462273,Urologic Education in the Era of COVID-19: Results From a Webinar-Based Reconstructive Urology Lecture Series,2021,"Anosmia, a neuropathogenic condition of loss of smell, has been recognized as a key pathogenic hallmark of the current pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection responsible for COVID-19. While the anosmia resulting from olfactory bulb (OB) pathology is the prominent clinical characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD), SARS-CoV-2 infection has been predicted as a potential risk factor for developing Parkinsonism-related symptoms in a significant portion of COVID-19 patients and survivors. SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to alter the dopamine system and induce the loss of dopaminergic neurons that have been known to be the cause of PD. However, the underlying biological basis of anosmia and the potential link between COVID-19 and PD remains obscure. Ample experimental studies in rodents suggest that the occurrence of neural stem cell (NSC) mediated neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium (OE) and OB is important for olfaction. Though the occurrence of neurogenesis in the human forebrain has been a subject of debate, considerable experimental evidence strongly supports the incidence of neurogenesis in the human OB in adulthood. To note, various viral infections and neuropathogenic conditions including PD with olfactory dysfunctions have been characterized by impaired neurogenesis in OB and OE. Therefore, this article describes and examines the recent reports on SARS-CoV-2 mediated OB dysfunctions and defects in the dopaminergic system responsible for PD. Further, the article emphasizes that COVID-19 and PD associated anosmia could result from the regenerative failure in the replenishment of the dopaminergic neurons in OB and olfactory sensory neurons in OE.","Rethinavel, Harini Sri; Ravichandran, Sowbarnika; Radhakrishnan, Risna Kanjirassery; Kandasamy, Mahesh",J Chem Neuroanat,,697

In the current pandemic phase, all patients should be considered as potentially infected. Thus, the level of precaution recommended for the caregivers depends more on the type of procedure than on the patient's proved or suspected COVID-19 status. Procedures that are particularly at high risk of contamination are clinical and flexible endoscopic pharyngo-laryngological evaluation, and probably also video fluoroscopic swallowing exams. Voice rehabilitation should not be considered urgent at this time. Therefore, recommendations presented here mainly concern the management of swallowing disorders, which can sometimes be dangerous for the patient, and recent dysphonia.

463780,Back to basics: understanding the numbers behind COVID-19,2021,"Introduction: Although the efforts at global and national levels have attempted to decrease the COVID-19 pandemic, the low level of preparedness among healthcare providers is a challenge mainly in developing countries. Hence, this study is aimed at assessing the level of preparedness for COVID-19 and its associated factors among frontline healthcare providers in South Gondar public hospitals, northwest Ethiopia. Methods and Materials: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 207 selected healthcare providers who were working in South Gondar public hospital from July 08 to August 29, 2020. A pretested structured questionnaire was used to collect data. The healthcare providers were selected through simple random sampling techniques. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions with a 95% confidence interval were fitted with 95% CI to establish the associated factors with a low level of preparedness. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The overall level of preparedness among healthcare providers for COVID-19 was found to be 41.3% (95% CI: 37.4, 44.7). Only 81 (40.1%) healthcare providers had prepared for telling their family and friends if they are infected with COVID-19. Besides, only 23.8% of healthcare providers obtained alcohol-based hand sanitizer in every patient room. Factors associated with a low level of preparedness include being male (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.22-4.94), unmarried (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.44-8.00), and working experience less than five years (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.29-9.09). Conclusion: The level of preparedness among frontline healthcare providers towards COVID-19 was found to be very low. In the future, more emphasis should be placed on healthcare providers who are male, unmarried, and had working experience of lower than five years to decrease the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chanie, Ermias Sisay; Feleke, Dejen Getaneh; Fetene, Sheganew; Tigabu, Agimasie; Asnakew, Sintayehu; Tiruneh, Tegenaw; Mekie, Maru; Ayehu, Gashaw Walle; Bayih, Wubet Alebachew",Biomed Res Int,,697

Here, we assessed the impact of airway epithelial cellular composition on infection in air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of differentiated primary human tracheal (PTEC) and bronchial epithelial cells (PBEC). We first compared SARS-CoV-2 infection kinetics, related antiviral and inflammatory responses, and viral entry factors in PTEC and PBEC. Next, the contribution of differentiation time was investigated by differentiating ALI-PTEC/PBEC for 3-5 weeks and comparing dynamics of viral replication/spread, cellular composition and epithelial responses. We observed a gradual increase in viral load with prolonged culture duration. Ciliated and goblet cells were predominantly infected in both PTEC and PBEC. Immunofluorescence analysis and RT-qPCR showed that compared to other cell types mainly ciliated and goblet cell numbers were affected by increased culture duration. An increased proportion of these two target cell types was associated with increased viral load. Furthermore, modulation of cellular composition using IL-13 and the Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT, underlined the importance of both ciliated and goblet cells for infection. DAPT treatment resulted in a lower viral load and a relative increase in ciliated cells at the expense of goblet cells, compared to IL-13 treated cultures in which both cell types were present and viral load was higher. In conclusion, our results identify cellular composition as a contributing factor to airway epithelial susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCEIn this study, we determined an effect of culture duration and airway cellular composition of ALI-PBEC and ALI-PTEC cultures on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was increased with prolonged cell culture time and the total percentage and proportion of ciliated and goblet cells played an important role in infection level, suggesting that airway epithelial differentiation/maturation levels may in part determine susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The development of effective therapies either targeting virus replication or pathogenesis against SARS-CoV-2 requires robust cell culture-based infection models to test small molecules and biologicals. Therefore, it is important to identify factors that are essential for reliably modeling SARS-CoV-2-airway epithelial cell interactions. This study sheds light on virus-airway epithelial cell interactions and adds to the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 cell tropism in the airways. In addition, the effect of IL-13 on viral infection hints at a causal connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and (allergic) asthma.","Wang, Ying; Thaler, Melissa; Ninaber, Dennis; Does, Anne Margaretha van der; Ogando, Natacha S.

We compared the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 76 breakthrough cases after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), or JNJ-78436735 (Janssen) to unvaccinated controls (February-April 2021) in metropolitan New York, including their phylogenetic relationship, distribution of variants, and full spike mutation profiles. Their median age was 48 years; seven required hospitalization and one died. Most breakthrough infections (57/76) occurred with B.1.1.7 (Alpha) or B.1.526 (Iota). Among the 7 hospitalized cases, 4 were infected with B.1.1.7, including 1 death. Both unmatched and matched statistical analyses considering age, sex, vaccine type, and study month as covariates supported the null hypothesis of equal variant distributions between vaccinated and unvaccinated in chi-squared and McNemar tests (p>0.1) highlighting a high vaccine efficacy against B.1.1.7 and B.1.526. There was no clear association among breakthroughs between type of vaccine received and variant. In the vaccinated group, spike mutations in the N-terminal domain and receptor-binding domain that have been associated with immune evasion were overrepresented. The evolving dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 variants requires broad genomic analyses of breakthrough infections to provide real-life information on immune escape mediated by circulating variants and their spike mutations.","Duerr, Ralf; Dimartino, Dacia; Marier, Christian; Zappile, Paul; Wang, Guiqing; Lighter, Jennifer; Elbel, Brian; Troxel, Andrea; Heguy, Adriana",,,697

466250,[COVID-19 and changes in smoking behavior],2020,"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 has impacted many facets of daily life and the legal system is no exception. Legal scholars have hypothesized that the effects of the pandemic may contribute to more coercive plea bargains (Cannon, 2020; Johnson, 2020). In this study, we explored defense attorneys' perceptions of whether and how the plea process has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. HYPOTHESES: This study was exploratory, and we made no a priori hypotheses. METHOD: We surveyed 93 practicing United States defense attorneys about their perceptions of whether and how the pandemic has affected court procedures, plea-bargaining and prosecutorial behavior, and defendant decision-making. We conducted semistructured follow-up interviews with 13 defense attorneys to help contextualize the survey responses. RESULTS: The majority of defense attorneys (81%, n = 76) reported that the plea process had changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that they experienced difficulty contacting and communicating with their clients, especially those who were detained. Two thirds of defense attorneys (n = 42) who said the plea process had changed thought that prosecutors were offering more lenient deals. One third of defense attorneys with detained clients (n = 23) reported having had clients plead guilty due to COVID-19 related conditions who might not have under normal circumstances. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of defense attorneys reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted their ability to access and advise clients, and they believed that leverage in plea negotiations had shifted further to individual prosecutors. At the same time, the attorneys reported that prosecutors were offering more lenient deals, painting a complex picture of the plea negotiation process during the pandemic.

So far, it is unknown if the reported variety in infection rates among healthcare personnel is related to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) or other factors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between PPE use and SARS-CoV-2 infections among ED personnel in the Netherlands. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A nationwide survey, consisting of 42 questions about PPE-usage, ED layout - and workflow and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of permanent ED staff, was sent to members of the Dutch Society of Emergency Physicians. Members were asked to fill out one survey on behalf of the ED of their hospital. The association between PPE use and the infection rate was investigated using univariable and multivariable regression analyses, adjusting for potential confounders. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was the incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among permanent ED staff between 1 March and 15 May 2020. RESULTS: Surveys were sent to 64 EDs of which 45 responded (70.3%). In total, 164 ED staff workers [5.1 (3.2-7.0)%] tested positive for COVID-19 during the study period compared to 0.087% of the general population. There was significant clustering of infected ED staff in some hospitals (range: 0-23 infection). In 13 hospitals, an FFP2 (filtering facepiece particles >94% aerosol filtration) mask or equivalent and eye protection was worn for all contacts with patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 during the whole study period. The unadjusted staff infection rate was higher in these hospitals [7.3 (3.4-11.1) vs. 4.0 (1.9-6.1)%, absolute difference + 3.3%]. Hospital staff testing policy was identified as a potential confounder of the relation between PPE use and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (collinearity statistic 0.95). After adjusting for hospital testing policy, type of PPE was not associated with incidence of COVID 19 infections among ED staff (P = 0.40). CONCLUSION: In this cross-sectional study, the use of high-level PPE (FFP2 or equivalent and eye protection) by ED personnel during all contacts with patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 does not seem to be associated with a lower infection rate of ED staff compared to lower level PPE use. Attention should be paid to ED layout and social distancing to prevent cross-contamination of ED personnel.","Schmitz, Danique; Vos, Marieke; Stolmeijer, Renate; Lameijer, Heleen; Schönberger, Titus; Gaakeer, Menno I; de Groot, Bas; Eikendal, Ties; Wansink, Luuk; Ter Avest, Ewoud",Eur. j. emerg. med,,697
466269,Risk Impact besides Capital Structure and Investment Valuation into Public Housing Project's Investment Rate,2020,"The Covid-19 pandemic is a tragedy for those who have been hard hit worldwide. At the same time, it is also a test of concepts and practices of what good care is and requires, and how quality of care can be accounted for. In this paper, we present our Care-Ethical Model of Quality Enquiry (CEMQUE) and apply it to the case of residential care for older people in the Netherlands during the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of thinking about care in healthcare and social welfare as a set of separate care acts, we think about care as a complex practice of relational caring, crossed by other practices. Instead of thinking about professional caregivers as functionaries obeying external rules, we think about them as practically wise professionals. Instead of thinking about developing external quality criteria and systems, we think about cultivating (self-)reflective quality awareness. Instead of abstracting from societal forces that make care possible but also limit it, we acknowledge them and find ways to deal with them. Based on these critical insights, the CEMQUE model can be helpful to describe, interrogate, evaluate, and improve existing care practices. It has four entries: (i) the care receiver considered from their humanness, (ii) the caregiver considered from their solicitude, (iii) the care facility considered from its habitability and (iv) the societal, institutional and scholarly context considered from the perspective of the good life, justice and decency. The crux is enabling all these different entries with all their different aspects to be taken into account. In Corona times this turns out to be more crucial than ever.","Timmerman, Guus; Baart, Andries; den Bakker, Jan",Med Health Care Philos,,697
466606,Risk and resilience in radically redefined information environments;information practices during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"CONTEXT: Medical students are faced with the challenge of synthesizing large volumes of information quickly. With the increasing accessibility of technology, a ""flipped classroom"" allows students to learn foundational material independently. Class time is instead devoted to in-depth skill building with instructors, promoting an active learning environment. This method of content delivery is also relevant given the current COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively evaluate the benefit of adopting a flipped classroom approach in teaching physical exam skills (PES) to first-year osteopathic medical students. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted comparing first-year osteopathic students in the class of 2022 (n=201), who had taken the PES course traditionally, with the class of 2023 (n=203), who experienced the flipped classroom approach. Objective metrics such as cumulative grades, objective structural clinical examination performance (OSCE), and practical exam performance were compared using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U rank sum tests. Subjective measures such as student course evaluations were used to analyze course perceptions using independent sample t-tests assuming unequal variances. A faculty survey was administered to faculty who taught both cohorts to assess instructor attitudes toward the flipped classroom approach. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Spring 2020 quarter data was not included, given the transition of all classes to an online learning environment. RESULTS: The flipped classroom approach significantly improved objective student performance for the Fall (p=0.009) and Winter (p<0.001) student cumulative grades and the History-Taking OSCE (p=0.010). Performance on Fall and Winter practical exam scores had no significant association with the flipped classroom. General student perceptions of the course remained unchanged between both cohorts. Faculty survey results from 10 faculty members showed that six (60%) faculty members preferred the traditional classroom, while four (40%) preferred the flipped classroom. CONCLUSIONS: The flipped classroom approach showed some statistically significant improvement in student PES. Further studies are needed to evaluate the benefits of a flipped classroom approach using skills-based assessments styles to measure student performance, with a focus on standardization of in-classroom groupwork.","Bhai, Sahar Amin; Poustinchian, Brian",J Osteopath Med,,697

We set up a smartphone-based hybrid model of teledermatology services providing direct care to patients at our center. To analyse patient and physician-experience and acceptability for teledermatology over a 6-month-period, along with clinicodemographic profile of patients. METHODOLOGY: Single-center, retrospective study conducted from May 20, 2020 to October 31, 2020. Patient satisfaction level for teledermatology was assessed on a 4-point scale and compared with the satisfaction level during their previous physical visits prior to COVID-19 pandemic. A physician assessment form was utilised to record the experience of dermatologists while providing teledermatology services. RESULTS: Of 7530 patients registered, a successful consult was provided to 6125 patients (81.34%). Average number of teleconsultations/day rose from 23.60 in May 2020 to 77.96 in October 2020. Mean age of patients availing teledermatology services was 33.60 ± 16.99 years. Average distance to care and travel time were 100.90 ± 171.77 km and 135 ± 222.32 min, respectively. A definitive diagnosis could be ascertained in 5724 patients (93.45%) and in-person visit was recommended to 133 patients (2.2%). Out of 6125 patients, 5229 could be contacted for feedback, 935 (18.18%), 2230 (42.65%), 1749 (33.45%), and 300 patients (5.70%) reported being very satisfied, satisfied, partially satisfied, and unsatisfied, respectively. Of 1914 patients, who had availed in-person OPD facilities prior to the pandemic, 914 patients (49.62%) preferred in-person visits. Of 34 dermatologists surveyed, 88.2% felt comfortable providing teleconsultations and 82.4% felt the need to continue teledermatology services in the upcoming months. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, teledermatology is a valid alternative for in-person dermatology visits during the current crisis; helping with initial triage and further patient management. Further refinement of the process could lead to even more acceptability.","Handa, Sanjeev; Mehta, Hitaishi; Bishnoi, Anuradha; Vinay, Keshavamurthy; Mahajan, Rahul; Narang, Tarun; Kumaran, Muthu Sendhil; De, Dipankar; Dogra, Sunil; Parsad, Davinder",Dermatol Ther,,697

However,a systematic summarization-based narrative extraction that can facilitate communicating the main underlying events is lacking. To address this issue, we propose a novel event-based narrative summary extraction framework. Our proposed framework is designed as a probabilistic topic model, with categorical time distribution, followed by extractive text summarization. Our topic model identifies topics' recurrence over time with a varying time resolution. This framework not only captures the topic distributions from the data, but also approximates the user activity fluctuations over time. Furthermore, we define significance-dispersity trade-off (SDT) as a comparison measure to identify the topic with the highest lifetime attractiveness in a timestamped corpus. We evaluate our model on a large corpus of Twitter data, including more than one million tweets in the domain of the disinformation campaigns conducted against the White Helmets of Syria. Our results indicate that the proposed framework is effective in identifying topical trends, as well as extracting narrative summaries from text corpus with timestamped data.","Oghaz, Toktam A.; Mutlu, Ece C.; Jasser, Jasser; Yousefi, Niloofar; Garibay, Ivan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06793v1.pdf,697

Evidence from higher education institutions in Pakistan in the light of COVID-19,2021,"Objective: Initial reports indicate a high incidence of acute kidney injury(AKI) in the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Hypertension(HTN) frequently coexists with COVID-19 and may be a possible risk factor for AKI. The aim of the study was to investigate the contribution of HTN for the AKI development in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Design and method: A retrospective analysis of the register of patients with COVID-19 was performed. COVID-19 was defined as the laboratory-confirmed infection and/or presence of the typical CT picture. AKI definition was based on KDIGO criteria. P value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The register included 721 patients(49.6% male, age 64±15.7 years, HTN in 66%, controlled in 80%, obesity in 50.8%, diabetes mellitus(DM) in 24.2%, chronic kidney disease(CKD) in 6%). The median length of stay was 11[9;15] days, in the ICU-4[2;9] days. 18.9% of patients died. Mean blood pressure at admission was 130±17/80±11 mmHg in the hypertensive group. 40.3% of patients received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors(ACEi) or angiotensin II-receptors blockers(ARBs) regularly before admission. In 79% therapy was continued, in 21%-withdrawn. The AKI incidence in the register was 27.2%, in hypertensive patients-30.1%. ACEi /ARBs intake wasn't associated with AKI. Hypertensive patients compared to normotensives were older (69±12vs50±15, p&lt;0.0001), more often had DM (31.7%vs10%, p&lt;0.0001), CKD (8%vs2%, p=0.01). History of HTN was associated with higher mortality (23.6%vs10.7%, p=0.001). HTN incidence was higher in patients with AKI (80%vs61%, p&lt;0.0001) and HTN was a risk factor for AKI development (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.49-4.13, p=0.0002). Hypertensive patients with AKI compared to patients without AKI had longer duration of hospitalization (13±7vs12±6 days, p=0.003), were more likely to be treated with mechanical ventilation (50%vs13%, p&lt;0.0001), more often were in the ICU (46.5%vs16.4%, p&lt;0.001 and had higher in-hospital mortality (48%vs9.7%, respectively, p&lt;0.0001).The AKI development and history of HTN were predictors of mortality: OR 8.90 (95%CI 5.7-13.78, p&lt;0.0001) and OR 2.58 (95%CI 1.46-4.75, p=0.0006), respectively. Conclusions: AKI is common among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and is associated with the presence of HTN.

The strategies for lacrimal practice were classified into 7 subtypes, and each of the blueprints were reassessed based on existing information on resumption strategies of elective surgeries from other specialties in COVID-19 era. The specific needs of lacrimal practice were then added to construct algorithms summarizing the resumption strategies. The basic principle of 'primum non nocere' needs to be followed. The overall proposed plan advocates the transition to a more sustainable health care reality in a world where we would still co-exist with COVID-19. A comprehensive effort involving screening, laboratory testing, appropriate triage, effective personal protection and specific precautionary measures for lacrimal clinics and operating room are needed to be able to safely resume elective surgery when the pandemic peak declines. To predict the timing of the resumption of elective surgeries is quite complex and influenced by several geographic, political and economic factors. It is equally important to remember that COVID-19 crisis is a dynamic situation and constantly evolving, hence the strategies provided are subject to change. Strict adherence to standard COVID-19 guidelines combined with effective testing and personal protection strategies can ensure slow yet smooth and safe return to full lacrimal practice after the COVID-19 pandemic calms down.

471513,Conducting research in a pandemic: The power of social media,2020,"BACKGROUND: Research on the use of video-mediated technology for medical consultations is increasing rapidly. Most research in this area is based on questionnaires and focuses on long-term conditions. The few studies that have focused on physical examinations in video consultations indicated that it poses challenges for the participants. The specific activity of wound assessment through video in postsurgery consultations has not yet been studied. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of face-to-face and video settings on the moment-to-moment organization of such an activity is original. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of video technology on the procedure of postsurgery wound assessment and its limits. METHODS: We recorded 22 postoperative video consultations and 17 postoperative face-to-face consultations. The primary purpose of the consultation was to inform the patient about the final pathology results of the resected specimen, and the secondary purpose was to check on the patient's recovery, including an assessment of the closed wound. The recordings were transcribed in detail and analyzed using methods of conversation analysis. RESULTS: The way that an assessment of the wound is established in video consultations differs from the procedure in face-to-face consultations. In the consultation room, wound assessments overwhelmingly (n=15/17) involve wound showings in the context of surgeons reporting their observations formatted with evidentials (""looks neat"") and subsequently assessing what these observations imply or what could be concluded from them. In contrast, wound assessments in video consultations do not tend to involve showing the wound (n=3/22) and, given the technological restrictions, do not involve palpation. Rather, the surgeon invites the patient to assess the wound, which opens up a sequence of patient and physician assessments where diagnostic criteria such as redness or swollenness are made explicit. In contrast to observations in regular consultations, these assessments are characterized by epistemic markers of uncertainty (""I think,"" ""sounds...good"") and evidentials are absent. Even in cases of a potential wound problem, the surgeon may rely on questioning the patient rather than requesting a showing. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of video technology on postoperative consultations is that a conclusive wound assessment is arrived at in a different way when compared to face-to-face consultations. In video consultations, physicians enquire and patients provide their own observations, which serve as the basis for the assessment. This means that, in video consultations, patients have a fundamentally different role. These talking-based assessments are effective unless, in cases of a potential problem, patient answers seem insufficient and a showing might be beneficial.","Stommel, Wyke J P; van Goor, Harry; Stommel, Martijn W J",J Med Internet Res,,697

New York State has been hardest hit by the virus with over 380 000 citizens with confirmed COVID-19, the illness associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. At our institution, the medical physics and dosimetry group developed a pandemic preparedness plan to ensure continued operation of our service. Actions taken included launching remote access to clinical systems for all dosimetrists and physicists, establishing lines of communication among staff members, and altering coverage schedules to limit on-site presence and decrease risk of infection. The preparedness plan was activated March 23, 2020, and data were collected on treatment planning and chart checking efficiency for 6 weeks. External beam patient load decreased by 25% during the COVID-19 crisis, and special procedures were almost entirely eliminated excepting urgent stereotactic radiosurgery or brachytherapy. Efficiency of treatment planning and chart checking was slightly better than a comparable 6-week interval in 2019. This is most likely due to decreased patient load: Fewer plans to generate and more physicists available for checking without special procedure coverage. Physicists and dosimetrists completed a survey about their experience during the crisis and responded positively about the preparedness plan and their altered work arrangements, though technical problems and connectivity issues made the transition to remote work difficult. Overall, the medical physics and dosimetry group successfully maintained high-quality, efficient care while minimizing risk to the staff by minimizing on-site presence. Currently, the number of COVID-19 cases in our area is decreasing, but the preparedness plan has demonstrated efficacy, and we will be ready to activate the plan should COVID-19 return or an unknown virus manifest in the future.","Riegel, Adam C; Chou, Henry; Baker, Jameson; Antone, Jeffrey; Potters, Louis; Cao, Yijian",J Appl Clin Med Phys,,697

It is reported that SARS-CoV2 seems to have relatively low pathogenicity and higher transmissibility than previously outbroke SARS-CoV. To explore the reason of increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV2 compared to SARS-CoV, we have performed a comparative analysis on the structural proteins (Spike, Envelope, Membrane, Nucleoprotein) of two viruses. Our analysis revealed that extensive substitutions of hydrophobic to polar and charged amino acids in spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV2 creates an intrinsically disordered region (IDR)at the beginning of membrane-fusion subunit and intrinsically disordered residues in fusion peptide. IDR provides potential site for proteolysis by furin and enriched disordered residues facilitate prompt fusion of the SARS-CoV2 with host membrane by recruiting Molecular Recognition features. Here, we have hypothesized that mutation driven accumulation of intrinsically disordered residues in spike glycoproteins play dual role in enhancing viral transmissibility than previous SARS-corona virus. These analyses may help in epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

In this sense, dental offices, both in the public and private sectors, are high-risk settings of cross infection among patients, dentists and health professionals in the clinical environment (including hospital's intensive dental care facilities). This manuscript aims to compile current available evidence on prevention strategies for dental professionals. Besides, we briefly describe promising treatment strategies recognized until this moment. The purpose is to clarify dental practitioners about the virus history and microbiology, besides guiding on how to proceed during emergency consultations based on international documents. Dentists should consider that a substantial number of individuals (including children) who do not show any signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may be infected and can disseminate the virus. Currently, there is no effective treatment and fast diagnosis is still a challenge. All elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures should be postponed, keeping only urgent and emergency visits to the dental office. The use of teledentistry (phone calls, text messages) is a very promising tool to keep contact with the patient without being at risk of infection.","Pereira, L. J.; Pereira, C. V.; Murata, R.

While speech evaluation on English has been popular, automatic speech scoring on low resource languages remains challenging. Work in this area has focused on monolingual specific designs and handcrafted features stemming from resource-rich languages like English. Such approaches are often difficult to generalize to other languages, especially if we also want to consider suprasegmental qualities such as rhythm. In this work, we examine three different languages that possess distinct rhythm patterns: English (stress-timed), Malay (syllable-timed), and Tamil (mora-timed). We exploit robust feature representations inspired by music processing and vector representation learning. Empirical validations show consistent gains for all three languages when predicting pronunciation, rhythm and intonation performance.","Zhang, Huayun; Shi, Ke; Chen, Nancy F.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03675v1.pdf,697

Starting from China, it has spread worldwide, causing major morbidity and mortality. It primarily involves the pulmonary system, but other organ systems are not spared. Treatment is still elusive and evolving. The exact pathogenesis of renal damage from COVID-19 virus and the magnitude of renal failure in this infection are not very clear. PubMed was searched to identify published literature from 2019 to present using the following keywords: COVID-19, acute kidney injury, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, chronic kidney disease, renal replacement therapy, and dialysis. Cited references were also used to further identify relevant articles and literature elsewhere on the web.

A case in point is the disruptive effect of the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak on health service delivery and its consequences for malaria management in the affected West and Central African countries between 2014 and 2016. This could be the case with the current infectious disease pandemic (COVID-19) the world is experiencing as malaria illness shares many symptoms with COVID-19 illness. Caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19 is reported to have originated from Wuhan city, China in December 2019. COVID-19 was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Practically, all community infrastructure has been activated in affected countries in response to COVID-19. However, the deployment of huge resources in combating COVID-19 pandemic should not be a missed opportunity for the advancement of infectious diseases control including malaria. This calls for conscious and heightened effort to sustain the gains in malaria control. The WHO has emphasized that the response to the COVID-19 pandemic must utilize and strengthen existing infrastructure for addressing malaria and other infectious diseases globally. Leveraging these to maintain malaria control activities in endemic countries could boost and help to sustain the gains in malaria control in accordance with the 2016-2030 Global technical strategy for malaria (GTS) milestones. In addition, it will help to keep the ""High burden to high impact"" (HBHI) and other initiatives on track. This article highlights the commonalities of the two diseases, discusses implications and recommendations to support decision making strategies to keep malaria control on track in the COVID-19 pandemic era.","Ajayi, IkeOluwapo Oyeneye; Ajumobi, Olufemi Olamide; Falade, Catherine",Pan Afr Med J,,697

Strategic lockdowns and mandatory social distancing are immediate solutions in such scenarios. However, this leads to operational disruptions in education, manufacturing, economy, transportation, governance, and community. Although technological assistance is beneficial in overcoming such issues, the current Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure has limitations. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the possible IoT-based solutions that have the capacity of combating the COVID-19-like viruses. We highlight the societal impacts due to pandemics and identify the specific lacunae in current IoT solutions. We also provide comprehensive detail on how to overcome the challenges along with directions towards the possible technological trends for future research. Compared to existing reviews, our work offers a holistic view of the cause, effects, and the possible solutions that are existing, along with already existing solutions that can be customized to serve the special needs during the pandemic.

The mean age and body mass index were 46 ± 12 years and 49 ± 3 kg/m2. Patients developed their symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue) 1, 2, 4, and 14 days after surgery. One patient had unnoticed anosmia 2 days before surgery. Three patients were readmitted in hospital. All 4 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. In two patients who required admission in intensive care unit, other off-label therapies including antiretroviral and immunosuppressive agents were also administered. All patients survived. In conclusion, COVID-19 can complicate the postoperative course of patients after bariatric surgery. Correct diagnosis and management in the postoperative setting would be challenging. Timing of infection after surgery in our series would raise the possibility of hospital transmission of COVID-19: from asymptomatic patients at the time of bariatric surgery to the healthcare workers versus acquiring the COVID-19 infection by non-infected patients in the perioperative period.","Aminian, Ali; Kermansaravi, Mohammad; Azizi, Shahriar; Alibeigi, Peyman; Safamanesh, Sina; Mousavimaleki, Ali; Rezaei, Mohammad Taghi; Faridi, Maziar; Mokhber, Somayeh; Pazouki, Abdolreza; Safari, Saeed",Obes Surg,,697

As hospitals begin to recommence elective procedures, it is necessary to have a means to assess how resource intensive a given case may be. Objective: To evaluate the development and performance of a clinical decision support tool to inform resource utilization for elective procedures. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prognostic study, predictive modeling was used on retrospective electronic health records data from a large academic health system comprising 1 tertiary care hospital and 2 community hospitals of patients undergoing scheduled elective procedures from January 1, 2017, to March 1, 2020. Electronic health records data on case type, patient demographic characteristics, service utilization history, comorbidities, and medications were and abstracted and analyzed. Data were analyzed from April to June 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Predicitons of hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, and need to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility. These predictions were generated using the random forests algorithm. Predicted probabilities were turned into risk classifications designed to give assessments of resource utilization risk. Results: Data from the electronic health records of 42â¯199 patients from 3 hospitals were abstracted for analysis. The median length of stay was 2.3 days (range, 1.3-4.2 days), 6416 patients (15.2%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, 1624 (3.8%) received mechanical ventilation, and 2843 (6.7%) were discharged to a skilled nursing facility. Predictive performance was strong with an area under the receiver operator characteristic ranging from 0.76 to 0.93. Sensitivity of the high-risk and medium-risk groupings was set at 95%. The negative predictive value of the low-risk grouping was 99%. We integrated the models into a daily refreshing Tableau dashboard to guide decision-making. Conclusions and Relevance: The clinical decision support tool is currently being used by surgical leadership to inform case scheduling. This work shows the importance of a learning health care environment in surgical care, using quantitative modeling to guide decision-making.","Goldstein, Benjamin A; Cerullo, Marcelo; Krishnamoorthy, Vijay; Blitz, Jeanna; Mureebe, Leila; Webster, Wendy; Dunston, Felicia; Stirling, Andrew; Gagnon, Jennifer; Scales, Charles D",JAMA Netw Open,,697
478064,The impact of COVID-19 on SMEs in China: Textual analysis and empirical evidence,2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 was first experienced in Wuhan City, China, during December 2019 before it rapidly spread over globally. This paper has proposed a mathematical model for studying its transmission dynamics in the presence of face mask wearing and hospitalization services of human population in Tanzania. Disease-free and endemic equilibria were determined and subsequently their local and global stabilities were carried out. The trace-determinant approach was used in the local stability of disease-free equilibrium point while Lyapunov function technique was used to determine the global stability of both disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. Basic reproduction number, R 0 , was determined in which its numerical results revealed that, in the presence of face masks wearing and medication services or hospitalization as preventive measure for its transmission, R 0 = 0.698 while in their absence R 0 = 3.8 . This supports its analytical solution that the disease-free equilibrium point E 0 is asymptotically stable whenever R 0 < 1 , while endemic equilibrium point E &#8727; is globally asymptotically stable for R 0 > 1 . Therefore, this paper proves the necessity of face masks wearing and hospitalization services to COVID-19 patients to contain the disease spread to the population.","Mumbu, Abdul-Rahman J; Hugo, Alfred K",J Biol Dyn,,697

Such a model would be ideal for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Thus, here, we propose a topological model of an epidemic disease, which can take into account various types of interventions through a time-dependent contact network. Based on this model, we show that there is a maximum allowed number of persons one can see each day for each person so that we can suppress the epidemic spread. Reducing the number of persons to see for the hub persons is a key countermeasure for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Hirata, Yoshito",Chaos,,697

We aimed to distinguish clinical data and computed tomography (CT) images between COVID-19 and other lung diseases in an advanced care hospital. METHODS: We assessed clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients who were suspected of having COVID-19 between February 20 and May 21, 2020, at the University of Tokyo Hospital. RESULTS: Typical appearance for COVID-19 on CT images were found in 24 of 29 COVID-19 cases and 21 of 168 non-COVID-19 cases, according to the Radiological Society of North America Expert Consensus Statement (for predicting COVID-19, sensitivity 0.828, specificity 0.875, positive predictive value 0.533, negative predictive value 0.967). When we focused on cases with typical CT images, loss of taste or smell, and close contact with COVID-19 patients were exclusive characteristics for the COVID-19 cases. Among laboratory data, high fibrinogen (P < 0.01) and low white blood cell count (P < 0.01) were good predictors for COVID-19 with typical CT images in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In a relatively low prevalence region, CT screening has high sensitivity to COVID-19 in patients with suspected symptoms. When chest CT findings are typical for COVID-19, close contact, loss of taste or smell, lower white blood cell count, and higher fibrinogen are good predictors for COVID-19.","Amano, Yosuke; Kage, Hidenori; Tanaka, Goh; Gonoi, Wataru; Nakai, Yudai; Kurokawa, Ryo; Inui, Shohei; Okamoto, Koh; Harada, Sohei; Iwabu, Masato; Morizaki, Yutaka; Abe, Osamu; Moriya, Kyoji; Nagase, Takahide",Respiratory investigation (Online),,697

METHODS: We followed up 1174 patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)who were recovered and discharged for 6 months. RESULTS: There were 175 cases with clear IgG results 6 months after discharge, of which 82 (46.9%) were IgG (+) and 16 (9.1%) were IgG (dim+). Four hundred and forty-one participants (55.4%) had some kind of sequelae. The most common symptoms were fatigue (25.3%), sleep disorder (23.2%) and shortness of breath (20.4%). In those who had sequelae, 262 (59.4%) had more than one symptom. Critical cases were more likely to have cough (20.5% vs 11.6%, p = 0.023) and hypomnesis (15.1% vs 8.0%, p = 0.041) than severe cases. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that women are more likely to have multiple symptoms (p = 0.002), fatigue (p = 0.009) and sleep disorder (p = 0.008), whereas critical illness was found as independent risk factor for hypomnesis (p = 0.045).

No published data are available on the indirect effects of COVID-19 on high-risk medical specialties. Otorhinolaryngology is considered as one such specialty. Hence, we designed a national survey to address these issues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A google questionnaire was sent to all the otorhinolaryngologists in Czech Republic with the help of the Czech Society of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery to evaluate the problems they encountered during the first wave of COVID-19. Personal, professional and financial losses were also addressed. Online access to the survey was from 15th April 2020 to 26th April 2020. RESULTS: The psychosomatic indirect impact of the disease affected female doctors than males. Burnout syndrome was the most commonly reported problem. Around 44.75% of all doctors had a combination of health, financial and economic as well as professional development and educational issues. Doctors from private practices faced higher financial losses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that personal, professional and financial disturbances amongst doctors can lead to more serious consequences. With the lack of drastic measures in improving the support system for healthcare workers, the healthcare systems will fail quickly.

The occurrences of COVID infections are uneven across countries and the same is determined by socioeconomic situations prevailing in the countries besides the preparedness and management. The paper is an attempt to empirically examine the socioeconomic determinants of the occurrence of COVID in Asian countries considering the data as of June 18, 2020, for 42 Asian countries. A multiple regression analysis in a cross-sectional framework is specified and ordinary least square (OLS) technique with heteroscedasticity corrected robust standard error is employed to obtain regression coefficients. Explanatory variables that are highly collinear have been dropped from the analysis. The findings of the study show a positive significant association of per capita gross national income and net migration with the incidence of total COVID-19 cases and daily new cases. The size of net migration emerged to be a potential factor and positive in determining the total and new cases of COVID. Social capital as measured by voters' turnout ratio (VTR) in order to indicate the people's participation is found to be significant and negative for daily new cases per million population. People's participation has played a very important role in checking the incidence of COVID cases and its spread. In alternate models, countries having high incidence of poverty are also having higher cases of COVID. Though the countries having higher percentage of aged populations are more prone to be affected by the spread of virus, but the sign of the coefficient of this variable for Asian country is not in the expected line. Previous year health expenditure and diabetic prevalence rate are not significant in the analysis. Therefore, people-centric plan and making people more participatory and responsive in adhering to the social distancing norms in public and workplace and adopting preventive measures need to be focused on COVID management strategies. The countries having larger net migration and poverty ratio need to evolve comprehensive and inclusive strategies for testing, tracing, and massive awareness for sanitary practices, social distancing, and following government regulation for management of COVID-19, besides appropriate food security measures and free provision of sanitary kits for vulnerable section.","Varkey, Rittu S; Joy, Justin; Sarmah, Gargee; Panda, Prasant K",J Public Aff,,697

However, there are still areas where both thematically and especially methodologically the field would benefit from more pluralistic approaches. Especially comparative IE studies have been suggested in review studies to provide substantial promise for added contribution to the field, and novel methodological choices based on content analysis and secondary data have been called for in IE research. This study aims to respond to those omissions in the IE domain, by conducting a comparative study of Finnish and Russian international entrepreneurship through a discourse analysis supported by primary data in the form of interviews of Finnish and Russian entrepreneurs. The COVID-19 pandemic arriving globally in the first half of 2020 provides a timely topic in which to conduct such a study. As a result, we analyse the discourse in Finnish and Russian media about entrepreneurship before (2019) and during (2020) the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in each country. We find both similarities and differences in the tone and level of the discussion, and surprisingly the interviewed entrepreneurs are rather critical of the media discussion related to entrepreneurship in the time of the pandemic in their respective countries. We consider the theoretical and methodological implications arising from these results and suggest that the IE field would benefit from the added methodological richness that content analysis and discursive research methods can provide. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Torkkeli, L.; Ivanova-Gongne, M.; Vuorio, A.; Kulkov, I.",Contributions to Management Science,,697

The fabrication of pressure sensors in a cleanroom is expensive and time-consuming; however, the sensitivity, linearity, and other performance factors of those pressure sensors are exceptional. Moreover, sometimes we require sensors that are not expensive and can be fabricated rapidly where the other performance factors do not need to be highly remarkable. In this modern era, household materials and DIY (Do-it-yourself) techniques are quite helpful, highly utilized. They are recommended to fabricate low-cost sensors and healthcare devices for personalized medicine and low-cost consumer electronics. Different flexible capacitive pressure sensors are presented and experimentally characterized for acoustic and air-pressure monitoring in this thesis. The design criteria of a cantilever-based capacitive pressure sensor are discussed. The three different designs are analysed with aspect ratios of 1.5, 1.0, and 0.67. The sensor with an aspect ratio of 0.67 shows maximum sensitivity (mechanical and electrical), better response time, and the 1st and 2nd mode of resonant frequencies is comparatively less than the other two. The cantilever designs are susceptible to slight pressure; therefore, the diaphragm-based normal mode capacitive pressure sensor is introduced in the second chapter, which defines the design criteria of diaphragm shapes. The five different diaphragms analysed are circular, elliptical, pentagon, square, and rectangular shapes.

Increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines and intolerance of the patient's immune system to COVID-19 infection are the leading causes of hospitalization of these patients. The content used in this paper has been taken from English language articles (2005-2020) retrieved from the PubMed database and Google Scholar search engine using ""COVID-19,"" ""Autoimmune disease,"" ""Therapeutic,"" ""Pathogenesis,"" and ""Pathway"" keywords. The emergence of COVID-19 and its association with autoimmune disorders is a major challenge in the management of these diseases. The results showed that the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of autoimmune diseases can make diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 more challenging by preventing the fever. Due to the common pathogenesis of COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases, the use of autoimmune drugs as a possible treatment option could help control the virus. KEY POINTS: â¢ Inflammatory cytokines play an essential role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 â¢ ACE2 dysfunctions are related to the with COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases â¢ The use autoimmune diseases drugs can be useful in treating COVID-19.","Najafi, Sahar; Rajaei, Elham; Moallemian, Rezvan; Nokhostin, Forough",Clin. rheumatol,,697

486884,Trick or treat: Social Media's dissemination power of ophthalmologic information in the pandemic context,2021,"With the increased spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, more patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) are being reported worldwide. This systematic review with meta-analysis aims to analyse the clinical features, proposed pathogenesis and current treatment options for effective management of children with this novel entity. Electronic databases (Medline, Google Scholar, WHO, CDC, UK National Health Service, LitCovid, and other databases with unpublished pre-prints) were extensively searched, and all articles on MIS-C published from January 1, 2020, to October 10, 2020, were retrieved. English language studies were included. This systematic review analysed 17 studies with 992 MIS-C patients from low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and developed countries (France, the UK, Italy, Spain, Chile and the US CDC data). Fever (95%) was the most common clinical manifestation followed by gastrointestinal (78%), cardiovascular (75.5%), and respiratory system (55.3%) involvement. Laboratory or epidemiologic evidence of inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 infection was present. Though the exact pathogenesis remains elusive, virus-induced post-infective immune dysregulation appears to play a predominant role. Features resembling Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome or macrophage activation syndrome were present; 49% had shock; 32% had myocarditis; 18% had coronary vessel abnormalities and 9% had congestive cardiac failure. Sixty-three percent of the patients were admitted in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU); 63% received intravenous immunoglobulin, 58% received corticosteroids and 19% received alternate agents like tocilizumab; there were 22 (2.2%) deaths. Only 9/144 children in LMICs received tocilizumab that was significantly less than children in developed countries (p < 0.0001). This systematic review delineates and summarises recently published data on MIS-C from LMICs and developed countries. Although most needed PICU admission and received treatment with IVIG and steroids, most of the patients survived. Significantly fewer patients in developing countries received tocilizumab therapy than those in developed countries. It is crucial for clinician to recognise MIS-C, to differentiate it from other defined inflammatory conditions and initiate early treatment. Further studies are needed for long-term prognosis, especially relating to cardiac complications of MIS-C.

487146,Molecular immune pathogenesis and diagnosis of covid-19-a review,2020,"Importance: Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C is highly effective but expensive. Evidence is scarce on whether DAA therapy reduces downstream medical costs. Objective: To examine the association of DAA therapy with posttreatment medical costs among Medicare beneficiaries. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study obtained data from various Medicare claims files for 2013 to 2017. The study population comprised patients with a hepatitis C diagnosis in 2014 who were enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare and Part D. Multivariate regression models were used to compare changes in medical costs over a 30-month posttreatment follow-up period between patients who used DAA therapy (treatment group) and a propensity score-matched cohort of patients who did not use DAA (control group). The model was estimated separately for patients with and those without cirrhosis. Data were analyzed between September 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020. Exposures: Completion of DAA therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Two outcomes were established: hepatitis C or liver disease-related costs and total medical costs. Costs were measured by Medicare-allowed payments, which included Medicare reimbursements, patient responsibilities, and third-party payments. Results: A propensity score-matched cohort of 15â¯198 patients (9038 men [59.5%]; mean [SD] age, 60.2 [10.8] years) was analyzed. During the first 6 months after DAA therapy, hepatitis C or liver disease-related costs decreased by $2498 (95% CI, -$3356 to -$1640) in patients with cirrhosis and by $486 (95% CI, -$603 to -$369) in patients without cirrhosis compared with control or untreated patients. Cumulative reductions in hepatitis C or liver disease-related costs during 30 months after DAA treatment were $15â¯808 (95% CI, -$22â¯530 to -$9085) in patients with cirrhosis and $5372 (95% CI, -$6384 to -$4360) in patients without cirrhosis. Among those who used DAA therapy compared with control patients, total medical costs decreased by $2905 (95% CI, -$4832 to -$979) in patients with cirrhosis and by $1287 (95% CI, -$2393 to -$283) in patients without cirrhosis during the first 6 months after DAA therapy. No statistically significant association was found between DAA therapy and total medical cost reductions after 12 months of follow-up. Cumulative reductions in total costs during 30 months after DAA therapy were $7074 (95% CI, -$18â¯448 to $4298) in patients with cirrhosis and $7497 (95% CI, -$14â¯287 to -$709) in patients without cirrhosis. Conclusions and Relevance: This study reported that DAA therapy appeared to be associated with a decrease in hepatitis C or liver disease-related costs for 30 months after treatment and with reduction in total medical costs for only 12 months after treatment in patients with or without cirrhosis. Longer-term follow-up studies with diverse outcomes are necessary to assess the value of DAA therapy.","Jung, Jeah; Feldman, Roger; Kalidindi, Yamini; Riley, Thomas",JAMA Netw Open,,697

487589,Future research avenues to facilitate social connectedness and safe collective behavior at organized crowd events,2021,"The presence of SARS-CoV-2 mutants, including the emerging variant B.1.1.7, has raised great concerns in terms of pathogenesis, transmission, and immune escape. Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 mutations, evolution, and effects on infectivity and pathogenicity is crucial to the design of antibody therapies and surveillance strategies. Here, we analyzed 454,443 SARS-CoV-2 spike genes/proteins and 14,427 whole-genome sequences. We demonstrated that the early variant B.1.1.7 may not have evolved spontaneously in the United Kingdom or within human populations. Our extensive analyses suggested that Canidae, Mustelidae or Felidae, especially the Canidae family (for example, dog) could be a possible host of the direct progenitor of variant B.1.1.7. An alternative hypothesis is that the variant was simply yet to be sampled. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome represents a large number of potential co-mutations. In addition, we used an experimental SARS-CoV-2 reporter replicon system to introduce the dominant co-mutations NSP12_c14408t, 5'UTR_c241t, and NSP3_c3037t into the viral genome, and to monitor the effect of the mutations on viral replication. Our experimental results demonstrated that the co-mutations significantly attenuated the viral replication. The study provides valuable clues for discovering the transmission chains of variant B.1.1.7 and understanding the evolutionary process of SARS-CoV-2.","Zhang, J.; Zhang, Y.; Kang, J.

487920,Challenges for Education during the Pandemic: An Overview of Literature,2021,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease that affects the respiratory system. In addition to the severe effects of the disease on health, the pandemic caused a negative impact on basic needs and services, employment, education, and economy worldwide. In Jordan, the whole country locked down, and quarantine was enforced by the military forces, which successfully controlled the spread of the disease. This research aims to study the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated quarantine on university students' beliefs about online learning practice in Jordan. An online descriptive survey involved questions that covered students' demographic information, student's basic and advanced knowledge about COVID-19, students' online learning experience during the quarantine, and finally students' views on the enforced quarantine practice in Jordan. Results showed that students have a good knowledge (>50%) about the COVID-19 basic information and a moderate knowledge (<50%) regarding COVID-19 advanced information. In general, students were pessimistic about the future of COVID-19 both locally and worldwide. Although some students acknowledged that they learned new skills in the fields of electronics, informatics, and computer software during the pandemic, most of them were unsatisfied about the quality and quantity of the given material, online exams, and the evaluation processes. Unfortunately, most of the students faced internet technical problems or challenges to electronic accessibility. The majority of the participants (>90%) supported the military-enforced quarantine implemented in the country despite the hard time the students had during the quarantine. We conclude that university students were able to protect themselves from COVID-19 through their good knowledge about the infectious disease and their commitment to follow the rules imposed by the Government of Jordan. Nevertheless, the challenges caused by the pandemic and its associated quarantine, combined with the sudden unprecedented online experience, negatively impacted students' thoughts and beliefs about the online learning experience during the quarantine. Further studies need to be performed in this context. We hope our results will help decision-makers better understand the students' attitudes and motivation toward online learning and how this will affect their future plans and decisions.","Almomani, Ensaf Y; Qablan, Ahmad M; Atrooz, Fatin Y; Almomany, Abbas M; Hajjo, Rima M; Almomani, Huda Y",Front Public Health,,697

In order for a SARS-CoV like virus circulating in wild life for a very long time to infect the index case-patient, a number of conditions must be met, foremost among which is the encounter with humans and the presence in homo sapiens of a cellular receptor allowing the virus to bind. Recently it was shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, binds to the human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This molecule is a peptidase expressed at the surface of lung epithelial cells and other tissues, that regulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Humans are not equal with respect to the expression levels of the cellular ACE2. Moreover, ACE2 polymorphisms were recently described in human populations. Here we review the most recent evidence that ACE2 expression and/or polymorphism could influence both the susceptibility of people to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the outcome of the COVID-19 disease. Further exploration of the relationship between the virus, the peptidase function of ACE2 and the levels of angiotensin II in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients should help to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease and the multi-organ failures observed in severe COVID-19 cases, particularly heart failure.","Devaux, Christian A; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Raoult, Didier",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,,697

The case of higher education in economics in Romania,2021,"A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) has been the cause of a recent global pandemic. The highly contagious nature of this life-threatening virus makes it imperative to find therapies to counteract its diffusion. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a promising drug target due to its indispensable role in viral replication inside the host. Using a combined two-steps approach of virtual screening and molecular docking techniques, we have screened an in-house collection of small molecules, mainly composed of natural and nature-inspired compounds. The molecules were selected with high structural diversity to cover a wide range of chemical space into the enzyme pockets. Virtual screening experiments were performed using the blind docking mode of the AutoDock Vina software. Virtual screening allowed the selection of structurally heterogeneous compounds capable of interacting effectively with the enzymatic site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The compounds showing the best interaction with the protein were re-scored by molecular docking as implemented in AutoDock, while the stability of the complexes was tested by molecular dynamics. The most promising candidates revealed a good ability to fit into the protein binding pocket and to reach the catalytic dyad. There is a high probability that at least one of the selected scaffolds could be promising for further research.","Mazzini, Stefania; Musso, Loana; Dallavalle, Sabrina; Artali, Roberto",Molecules (Basel),,697

All consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (Shanghai, China) between January 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020, were enrolled, and their clinical data were retrospectively collected. Binary logistic regression was used to screen the factors associated with disease aggravation, and multivariable analyses with the Cox proportional hazards model were used to estimate the effects of prognostic factors on the improvement time and PCR conversion days in throat swabs and stool swabs. A total of 616 patients, including 50 (8.11%) severe and 18 (2.92%) critical patients, were enrolled in our retrospective cohort study. The early use of hydroxychloroquine was a protective factor associated with disease aggravation (95% CI: 0.040-0.575, p = 0.006). Clinical improvement by 20 days was significantly different between patients with hydroxychloroquine used early and those with hydroxychloroquine not used (p = 0.016, 95% CI: 1.052-1.647). The median time to clinical improvement was 6 days in the hydroxychloroquine used early group, compared with 9 days in the without hydroxychloroquine used group and 8 days in the with hydroxychloroquine not used early group (p < 0.001). Hydroxychloroquine used early was associated with earlier PCR conversion in both throat swabs (HR = 1.558, p = 0.001) and stool swabs (HR = 1.400, p = 0.028). The use of hydroxychloroquine at an early stage is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating patients before irreversible severe respiratory complications occur. The early use of hydroxychloroquine decreased the improvement time and the duration of COVID-19 detection in throat and stool swabs.","Su, Yi; Ling, Yun; Ma, Yuyan; Tao, Lili; Miao, Qing; Shi, Qingfeng; Pan, Jue; Lu, Hongzhou; Hu, Bijie",Biosci Trends,,697

493796,Black Carbon Emission Reduction Due to COVID-19 Lockdown in China,2021,"BACKGROUND: Emergency Departments (EDs) have served as critical surveillance sites for infectious diseases. We sought to determine the prevalence and temporal trends of acute (by PCR) and convalescent (by antibody [Ab]) SARS-CoV-2 infection during the earliest phase of the pandemic among patients in an urban ED in Baltimore City. METHODS: We tested remnant blood samples from 3255 unique ED patients, collected between March 16th and May 31st 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 Ab. PCR for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection from nasopharyngeal swabs was obtained on any patients based on clinical suspicion. Hospital records were abstracted and factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed. RESULTS: Of 3255 ED patients, 8.2% (95%CI: 7.3%, 9.2%) individuals had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 155 PCR+, 78 Ab+, and 35 who were both PCR+ and Ab+. Prevalence of disease increased throughout the study period, ranging from 3.2% (95%CI: 1.8%, 5.2%) PCR+ and 0.6% (95%CI: 0.1%, 1.8%) Ab+ in March, to 6.2% (95%CI: 5.1%, 7.4%) PCR+ and 4.2% (95%CI: 3.3%, 5.3%) Ab+ in May. The highest SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was found in Hispanic individuals who made up 8.4% (95%CI: 7.4%, 9.4%) of individuals screened, but 35% (95%CI: 29%, 41%) of infections (PCR and/or Ab+). Demographic and clinical factors independently associated with acute infection included Hispanic ethnicity, loss of smell or taste, subjective fever, cough, muscle ache and fever. Factors independently associated with convalescent infection were Hispanic ethnicity and low oxygen saturation. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of COVID-19 in Baltimore City increased dramatically over the 11-week study period and was disproportionately higher among Hispanic individuals. ED-based surveillance methods are important for identifying both acute and convalescent SARS-CoV-2 infections and provides important information regarding demographic and clinical correlates of disease in the local community.","Laeyendecker, Oliver; Hsieh, Yu-Hsiang; Rothman, Richard E; Dashler, Gaby; Kickler, Thomas; Fernandez, Reinaldo E; Clarke, William; Patel, Eshan U; Tobian, Aaron A R; Kelen, Gabor D; Quinn, Thomas C",Am J Emerg Med,,697

495340,The digital transformation of medical education,2021,"In late 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, capital city of Hubei province in China. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection quickly grew by several thousand per day. Less than 100 days later, the World Health Organization declared that the rapidly spreading viral outbreak had become a global pandemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is typically associated with fever and respiratory symptoms. It often progresses to severe respiratory distress and multi-organ failure which carry a high mortality rate. Older patients or those with medical comorbidities are at greater risk for severe disease. Inflammation, pulmonary edema and an over-reactive immune response can lead to hypoxia, respiratory distress and lung damage. Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) possess potent and broad-ranging immunomodulatory activities. Multiple in vivo studies in animal models and ex vivo human lung models have demonstrated the MSC's impressive capacity to inhibit lung damage, reduce inflammation, dampen immune responses and aid with alveolar fluid clearance. Additionally, MSCs produce molecules that are antimicrobial and reduce pain. Upon administration by the intravenous route, the cells travel directly to the lungs where the majority are sequestered, a great benefit for the treatment of pulmonary disease. The in vivo safety of local and intravenous administration of MSCs has been demonstrated in multiple human clinical trials, including studies of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recently, the application of MSCs in the context of ongoing COVID-19 disease and other viral respiratory illnesses has demonstrated reduced patient mortality and, in some cases, improved long-term pulmonary function. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASC), an abundant type of MSC, are proposed as a therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19 in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Additionally, when proven to be safe and effective, ASC treatments may reduce the demand on critical hospital resources. The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in significant healthcare and socioeconomic burdens across the globe. There is a desperate need for safe and effective treatments. Cellular based therapies hold great promise for the treatment of COVID-19. This literature summary reviews the scientific rationale and need for clinical studies of adipose-derived stem cells and other types of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of patients who suffer with COVID-19.","Rogers, Christopher J; Harman, Robert J; Bunnell, Bruce A; Schreiber, Martin A; Xiang, Charlie; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Santidrian, Antonio F; Minev, Boris R",J Transl Med,,697

The molecular mechanism of the membrane modifications that elicits microautophagy still remains elusive. In this study, an analysis of membrane lipid distribution at a nanoscale level showed that PtdIns(4)P is localized in the cytoplasmic leaflet of microautophagic vesicles, which are derived when the vacuole's membrane domains engulfed LDs both in the stationary phase and in acute nitrogen starvation. Furthermore, the PtdIns(4)P-positive raft-like domains engulf LDs through a microautophagic mechanism. When single temperature-conditional mutants of STT4 or PIK1 PtdIns 4-kinases were used, in the vacuole of STT4 and PIK1 mutant cells, microautophagic vesicles drastically decreased at restrictive temperatures, and the labeling density of PtdIns(4)P on the microautophagic vesicles and the sizes of the mutants' microautophagic vesicles also decreased. These results suggest that both Stt4p and Pik1p have important roles in the microautophagy of the vacuole in the stationary phase and under nitrogen starvation conditions.","Kurokawa, Yuna; Konishi, Rikako; Yoshida, Akane; Tomioku, Kanna; Tanabe, Kenji; Fujita, Akikazu",Biochim Biophys Acta Biomembr,,697

497512,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Elective Surgery for Colorectal Cancer,2021,"Goal: We propose a speech modeling and signal-processing framework to detect and track COVID-19 through asymptomatic and symptomatic stages. Methods: The approach is based on complexity of neuromotor coordination across speech subsystems involved in respiration, phonation and articulation, motivated by the distinct nature of COVID-19 involving lower (i.e., bronchial, diaphragm, lower tracheal) versus upper (i.e., laryngeal, pharyngeal, oral and nasal) respiratory tract inflammation, as well as by the growing evidence of the virus’ neurological manifestations. Preliminary results: An exploratory study with audio interviews of five subjects provides Cohen's d effect sizes between pre-COVID-19 (pre-exposure) and post-COVID-19 (after positive diagnosis but presumed asymptomatic) using: coordination of respiration (as measured through acoustic waveform amplitude) and laryngeal motion (fundamental frequency and cepstral peak prominence), and coordination of laryngeal and articulatory (formant center frequencies) motion. Conclusions: While there is a strong subject-dependence, the group-level morphology of effect sizes indicates a reduced complexity of subsystem coordination. Validation is needed with larger more controlled datasets and to address confounding influences such as different recording conditions, unbalanced data quantities, and changes in underlying vocal status from pre-to-post time recordings.","Quatieri, Thomas F.; Talkar, Tanya Palmer Jeffrey S.",IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology,,697

Research is critically needed to identify the impact of the pandemic on children’s mental health including psychosocial factors that predict resilience, recovery, and persistent distress. The present study collected data in June-July 2020 to describe children’s mental health during the initial phase of the pandemic, including the magnitude and nature of psychiatric and psychological distress in children, and to evaluate social support as a putative psychosocial moderator of children’s increased distress. Method: Children and parents from 190 families of children aged 8 to 13 from the Windsor-Essex region of Southwestern Ontario reported (i) retrospectively on children’s well-being (e.g., worry, happiness) immediately prior to the pandemic and (ii) on children’s current well-being;irritability;social support;and anxiety, depressive, and posttraumatic stress symptoms at the baseline assessment of an ongoing longitudinal study of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Children and parents reported worsened well-being and psychological distress during the pandemic compared to retrospective report of pre-pandemic well-being. Child-perceived social support from family and friends was associated with lower symptom severity and attenuated increase in psychological distress. Conclusions: Study findings suggest possible broad psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and are consistent with prior research that indicates a protective role of social support to mitigate the negative psychological impact of the pandemic. These findings may inform clinical assessments and highlight the need for public resources to safeguard children’s mental health.","Mactavish, A.; Mastronardi, C.; Menna, R.; Babb, K.

To better devise control strategies, policymakers should adjust policies based on scientific evidence in hand. Several countries have limited the epidemics of COVID-19 by prioritizing containment strategies to mitigate the impacts on public health and healthcare systems. However, asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19 complicated traditional symptom-based approaches for disease control. In addition, drastic population-based interventions usually have significant societal and economic impacts. Therefore, in Taiwan, the containment strategies consisted of the more extended case-based interventions (e.g., case detection with enhanced surveillance and contact tracing with active monitoring and quarantine of close contacts) and more targeted population-based interventions (e.g., face mask use in recommended settings and risk-oriented border control with corresponding quarantine requirement).

501141,The impact of COVID-19 on firm innovation: Evidence from Chinese listed companies,2021,"COVID-19 has fast-paced drug re-positioning for its treatment. This work builds computational models for the same. The aim is to assist clinicians with a tool for selecting prospective antiviral treatments. Since the virus is known to mutate fast, the tool is likely to help clinicians in selecting the right set of antivirals for the mutated isolate. The main contribution of this work is a manually curated database publicly shared, comprising of existing associations between viruses and their corresponding antivirals. The database gathers similarity information using the chemical structure of drugs and the genomic structure of viruses. Along with this database, we make available a set of state-of-the-art computational drug re-positioning tools based on matrix completion. The tools are first analysed on a standard set of experimental protocols for drug target interactions. The best performing ones are applied for the task of re-positioning antivirals for COVID-19. These tools select six drugs out of which four are currently under various stages of trial, namely Remdesivir (as a cure), Ribavarin (in combination with others for cure), Umifenovir (as a prophylactic and cure) and Sofosbuvir (as a cure). Another unanimous prediction is Tenofovir alafenamide, which is a novel tenofovir prodrug developed in order to improve renal safety when compared to the counterpart tenofovir disoproxil. Both are under trail, the former as a cure and the latter as a prophylactic. These results establish that the computational methods are in sync with the state-of-practice. We also demonstrate how the selected drugs change as the SARS-Cov-2 mutates over time, suggesting the importance of such a tool in drug prediction. The dataset and software is available publicly at https://github.com/aanchalMongia/DVA and the prediction tool with a user-friendly interface is available at http://dva.salsa.iiitd.edu.in.","Mongia, Aanchal; Saha, Sanjay Kr.; Chouzenoux, Emilie; Majumdar, Angshul",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01902v2.pdf,697

COVID-19 patients that develop cardiac injury are at increased risk of a worse clinical course with higher rates of mortality. Increasing amounts of evidence suggest that a system-wide inflammatory response and a cytokine storm mediated type syndrome plays a crucial role in disease progression. This systematic review investigates the possible role of hyperinflammation in inducing cardiac injury as one of the severe complications of COVID-19. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases to identify relevant clinical studies that investigated cardiovascular injury manifestations and reported inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. Only 29 studies met our inclusion criteria and the majority of these studies demonstrated significantly elevated inflammatory and cardiac blood markers. It was evident that underlying cardiovascular diseases may increase the risk of developing cardiac injury. However, many COVID-19 patients included in this review, developed different types of cardiac injury without having any underlying cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, many of these patients were either children or adolescents. Therefore, age and comorbidities may not always be the two main risk factors that dictate the severity and outcome of COVID-19. Further investigations are required to understand the underlying mechanisms of pathogenicity as an urgent requirement to develop the appropriate treatment and prevention strategies. These strategies may specifically target hyperinflammation as a suspected driving factor for some of the severe complications of COVID-19.","Saed Aldien, Arwa; Ganesan, Gowrii S; Wahbeh, Farah; Al-Nassr, Noor; Altarawneh, Heba; Al Theyab, Lolwa; Saed Aldien, Summia; Tomerak, Sara; Naveed, Hiba; Elshazly, Mohamed B; Zakaria, Dalia",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,,697

The series showcases the potential professional case managers have in support of managing during a crisis such as a global pandemic. Part II continues to describe reenvisioned roles and responsibilities of case managers and their leaders to meet the needs of patients/support systems during the crisis. It focuses on the increased need for end-of-life care, impact on workers' compensation case management practice, and the self-care needs of the professional case manager. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS: Applicable to the various case management practice settings across the continuum of health and human services, with special focus on acute care. FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in a crisis case managers and other health care professionals never faced something like it before. At the same time, it has provided opportunities for innovation and creativity including use of digital and telecommunication technology in new ways to ensure the continued delivery of health and human services to those who need them regardless of location. It has also resulted in the development of necessary and impactful partnerships within and across different health care organizations and diverse professional disciplines. Most importantly, this pandemic has required special attention to the increased need of patients for timely palliative and end-of-life care. In addition, it has prompted a focus on the safety, health, and well-being of case managers and other health care professionals, resulting in expanded workers' compensation case management practice coupled with the need for self-care and resilience. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: Professional case managers are integral members of interprofessional health care teams. Their roles and responsibilities are even more necessary during the uncertainty of a global pandemic such as COVID-19. So far, the experience of this crisis has resulted in a deliberate need to ensure the safety of both, those who are the recipients of health care services and those who are responsible for the provision of care. Self-care and resilience of health care professionals and case managers, especially due to the complex dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, have advanced a desirable and necessary view of remote/virtual practice and as a strategy for enhancing the person's health and well-being. This pandemic has forced the development of impactful partnerships and collaborations among the diverse contexts of health care organizations and support service providers. These contexts of care delivery have also emphasized the necessary legal and ethical practice of case managers and the other involved parties. Experts agree that the innovative care delivery methods practiced during the pandemic will undoubtedly remain as desirable beyond the current crisis period.","Tahan, Hussein M",Prof Case Manag,,697

Political influences on outbreak preparedness, response and reporting may also adversely affect control of SARS-CoV-2 in Syria. Syria reported its first case on 22 March 2020; however, concerns were raised that this was delayed and that underreporting continues. DISCUSSION: Syria's conflict has displaced more than half of its pre-war population, leaving 6.7 million people internally displaced. The consequent overcrowding - with insufficient water, sanitation and healthcare (including laboratory capacity) - could lead to conditions that are ideal for spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Syria. Political changes have led to the formation of at least three health systems within Syria's borders, each with its own governance, capacity and planning. This fragmentation, with little interaction between them, could lead to poor resource allocation and adversely affect control. As such, COVID-19 could overwhelm the health systems (particularly intensive care capacity), leading to high deaths across the population, particularly for the most vulnerable such as detainees. CONCLUSIONS: Locally implementable interventions that rapidly build WASH and health system capacity are required across Syria to ensure early detection and management of COVID-19 cases.","Abbara, Aula; Rayes, Diana; Fahham, Ola; Alhiraki, Omar Alrashid; Khalil, Munzer; Alomar, Abdulrahman; Tarakji, Ahmad",Int J Infect Dis,,697

Because of the exponentially growing number of new cases of both infections and deaths, development of new therapeutic options to help fight this pandemic is urgently needed. The target molecules of this study were the nitro derivatives of quinoline and quinoline N-oxide. Computational design at the DFT level, docking studies, and molecular dynamics methods as a well-reasoned strategy will aid in elucidating the fundamental physicochemical properties and molecular functions of a diversity of compounds, directly accelerating the process of discovering new drugs. In this study, we discovered isomers based on the nitro derivatives of quinoline and quinoline N-oxide, which are biologically active compounds and may be low-cost alternatives for the treatment of infections induced by SARS-CoV-2.","Assis, Letícia C; de Castro, Alexandre A; de Jesus, João P A; Nepovimova, Eugenie; Kuca, Kamil; Ramalho, Teodorico C; La Porta, Felipe A",Sci Rep,,697

METHODS: During the pandemic, 80 participants (25 patients with small fibre neuropathy (SFN), 42 patients with chronic migraine (CM) and 13 patients' healthy family members (HFM)) were asked to evaluate their COVID-19 complains, changes in habits and clinical management, behaviour, mood, loneliness, quality of life (QoL), physical and mental health and coping strategies. Data were analysed by Spearman rho correlations and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Patients had lower QoL, lower physical health and higher catastrophizing attitude towards pain than HFM. During the pandemic, SFN patients referred greater decline in clinical symptoms, worries about contagion and discomfort for disease management changes than CM patients. In the SFN group, the higher levels of disability were associated with suffering from changes in neurologist-patient relationship. CM patients complained of agitation/anxiety that was related to feelings of loneliness, depressive mood and catastrophism. DISCUSSION: Despite similar complains of change in habits and worries about COVID-19 pandemic, SFN and CM patients had distinct reactions. In SFN patients, pandemic distress impacted on physical health with worsening of clinical conditions, especially suffering from changes in their care. In CM patients, pandemic distress affected behaviour, mainly with psychological frailty. This suggests the need to customize public health care for patients with distinct chronic pain conditions.","Consonni, Monica; Telesca, Alessandra; Grazzi, Licia; Cazzato, Daniele; Lauria, Giuseppe",Neurol. sci,,697

509492,Is Bitcoin really more than a diversifier? A pre- and post-COVID-19 analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Understanding and monitoring the demographics of SARS-CoV-2 infection can inform strategies for prevention. Surveillance monitoring has suggested that the age distribution of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 has changed since the pandemic began, but no formal analysis has been performed. METHODS: Retrospective review of SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing results from a national reference laboratory was performed. Result distributions by age and positivity were compared between early period (March-April 2020) and late periods (June-July 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, a sub-analysis compared changing age distributions between inpatients and outpatients. RESULTS: There were 277,601 test results of which 19320 (7.0%) were positive. The median age of infected people declined over time (p < 0.0005). In March-April, the median age of positive people was 40.8 years (Interquartile range (IQR): 29.0-54.1). In June-July, the median age of positive people was 35.8 years (IQR: 24.0-50.2). The positivity rate of patients under 50 increased from 6.0 to 10.6 percent and the positivity rate for those over 50 decreased from 6.3 to 5.0 percent between the early and late periods. The trend was only observed for outpatient populations. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that there is a trend toward decreasing age among persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, but that these trends seem to be specific to the outpatient population. Overall, this suggests that observed age-related trends are driven by changes in testing patterns rather than true changes in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This calls for caution in interpretation of routine surveillance data until testing patterns stabilize.","Greene, Dina N; Jackson, Michael L; Hillyard, David R; Delgado, Julio C; Schmidt, Robert L",PLoS One,,697

A robust preparedness and personal protective equipment (PPE) were yet to be regarded as our best plan. METHODS: A survey study was conducted on 254 Egyptian house officers using an anonymous web-based questionnaire that was filled using Google Forms after obtaining online informed consent. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 25 years. Only 28.74% of the house officers were categorized as having a good preparedness, while 85.83% of them have a good PPE attitude. The preparedness and willingness were significantly associated with the overall worry related to the pandemic (P value = 0.012). Fear of contracting COVID-19 infection negatively affected their preparedness by 60% (odds ratio (OR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.17-0.93, P value = 0.034). The House officers with family members at-risk for severe COVID-19 were less likely to be prepared and willing by 70% (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.15-0.60, P value = 0.001). The house officers with good preparedness and willingness to deal with COVID-19 seemed to have a good PPE attitude (OR 11.48, 95% CI 2.43-54.34, P value = 0.002). CONCLUSION: A significant number of house officers expressed low levels of preparedness, while most of them have a good PPE attitude.","Ahmed Sayed, Asmaa; Mostafa Ahmed, Marwa; Talaat Elsayed, Inas; Saeed, Soliman; Inas, Alsallout; Nouran, Elfazary; Samar, Fares",J. public health (Oxf),,697

512023,A review of the possible implication of COVID-19 lockdown on eating habits,2020,"In this article, we consider the problem of change-point analysis for the count time series data through an integer-valued autoregressive process of order 1 (INAR(1)) with time-varying covariates. These types of features we observe in many real-life scenarios especially in the COVID-19 data sets where the number of active cases over time starts falling and then again increases. In order to capture those features, we use Poisson INAR(1) process with a time-varying smoothing covariate. By using such model, we can model both the components in the active cases at time-point t namely - (i) number of non-recovery cases from the previous time-point, and (ii) number of new cases at time-point t. We study some theoretical properties of the proposed model along with forecasting. Some simulation studies are performed to study the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, we analyze two COVID-19 data sets and compare our proposed model to another PINAR(1) process which has time-varying covariate but no change-point, to demonstrate the overall performance of our proposed model.","Chattopadhyay, Subhankar; Maiti, Raju; Das, Samarjit; Biswas, Atanu",Statistica neerlandica,,697
512315,"2019 novel coronavirus: A mysterious threat from Wuhan, China–A current review",2020,"The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in China, and it has quickly become a global threat to public health due to its rapid rate of transmission and fatalities. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a receptor that mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, as in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Several studies have reported that ACE2 expression is higher in Leydig, Sertoli and seminiferous ductal cells of males, as well as in ovarian follicle cells of females, suggesting possible potential pathogenicity of the coronavirus in the reproductive system. Higher ACE2 expression in the human placenta and reports of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among clinical cases have increased the relevance of further studies in this area. This review focuses on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 receptor and speculates on the mechanistic interplay in association with male and female reproductive physiology. In addition, based on the available literature, we discuss the alleged sex differences in terms of the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, which is claimed greater among males, and further explore the physiological role of ACE2 and 17ß-oestradiol for the same.","Sharma, G Taru; Chandra, Vikash; Mankuzhy, Pratheesh; Thirupathi, Yasotha; Swain, Dilip Kumar; Pillai, Harikrishna; Patel, Shailesh Kumar; Pathak, Mamta; Guttula, SaiKumar",Reprod. fertil. dev,,697

The implications of intensive homebased working,2020,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: To identify prognostic factors for local recurrence, distant metastasis and disease-specific survival (DSS) for lacrimal gland carcinoma. METHODS: All consecutive patients with lacrimal gland carcinoma treated from January 1998 through December 2018 were included. Log-rank tests and univariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to study risk factors and survival. RESULTS: Overall, 55 patients were included in this study, and 5 patients were excluded from the survival analysis. Median age was 46 years (range: 10-76). 43 patients (78%) had adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). 31 patients (56%) had T2 disease at presentation. 28 patients (51%) underwent orbital exenteration with or without adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiation, 26 (47%) underwent eye-sparing surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiation, and 1 received palliative chemoradiation. 11 patients (22%) experienced local recurrence; 14 (29%) experienced distant metastasis. Five- and 10-year local-recurrence-free survival rates were 0.71 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.88), and 5- and 10-year distant-metastasis-free survival rates were 0.67 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.85) and 0.49 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.81), respectively. There was no significant difference in risks of local recurrence, distant metastasis or DSS between ACC patients who had orbital exenteration and those who had eye-sparing surgery. Perineural invasion was negatively associated with local-recurrence-free survival (p=0.02). Among patients with ACC, basaloid/solid histologic type was associated with significantly worse DSS than non-basaloid/solid histologic type (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: For lacrimal gland carcinoma, orbital exenteration with adjuvant therapy and eye-sparing surgery with adjuvant therapy are associated with similar recurrence outcomes. Eye-sparing surgery is associated with better DSS. Perineural invasion is a risk factor for local recurrence. ACC with basaloid/solid subtype correlates with worse DSS.","Ford, Joshua Richard; Rubin, Maria Laura; Frank, Steven Jay; Ning, Jing; Debnam, James Matthew; Bell, Diana; El-Naggar, Adel; Ferrarotto, Renata; Esmaeli, Bita",Br. j. ophthalmol,,697

513065,Hospitality students at the online classes during COVID-19 – How personality affects experience?,2021,"Immune thrombocytopenia, often known as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), has emerged as an important complication of COVID-19. A systematic review was done to analyze the clinical profile and outcomes in a total of 45 cases of new-onset ITP in COVID-19 patients described in literature until date. A comprehensive approach is essential for diagnosing COVID-19-associated ITP after excluding several concomitant factors that can cause thrombocytopenia in COVID-19. Majority of ITP cases (71%) were found to be elderly (> 50 years) and 75% cases had moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Three patients (7%) were in the pediatric age group. Reports of ITP in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients (7%) underscore the need for COVID-19 testing in newly diagnosed patients with ITP irrespective of COVID-19 symptoms amid this pandemic. ITP onset occurred in 20% cases 3 weeks after onset of COVID-19 symptoms, with many reports after clinical recovery. SARS-CoV-2-mediated immune thrombocytopenia can be attributed to the underlying immune dysregulation, susceptibility mutations in SOCS 1, and other mechanisms, including molecular mimicry, cryptic antigen expression, and epitope spreading. No bleeding manifestations were reported in 31% cases at diagnosis. Severe life-threatening bleeding was uncommon. One case of mortality was attributed to intracranial hemorrhage. Secondary Evans syndrome was diagnosed in one case. Good initial response to short course of glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulin has been found with the exception of delayed lag response in one case. Thrombopoietin receptor agonist usage as a second-line agent has been noted in few cases for short duration with no adverse events. In the relatively short follow-up period, four relapses of ITP were found.","Bhattacharjee, Sukrita; Banerjee, Mainak",SN Compr Clin Med,,697

The aim of this study was to explore patient attitudes to surgery and theatre efficiency as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and assess a potential framework for the delivery of such services. METHODS: Prospectively collected data on theatre timings and procedures completed per session used to assess theatre efficiency comparing June 2019 to June 2020. Information on patient compliance with 14-day household isolation and attitudes to surgery were collected prospectively over a seven-week period using a questionnaire. Follow-up data were collected via telephone consultation a minimum of two weeks after discharge. RESULTS: Significant reduction in the number of points per session (p = 0.02) with a mean of 3.19 in 2019 and 2.42 in 2020. Only 18 of 31 patients were compliant with pre-operative isolation with individual failures accounting for four of 13 and failures by household members accounting for nine. Impact of COVID-19 and precautions on patient anxiety was mixed. No patients required symptomatic COVID-19 swab post-operatively. CONCLUSION: With the restrictions of COVID-19, there are significant problems with theatre efficiency, in effect losing an operation a list. Furthermore, compliance with pre-operative isolation was poor but to the best of our knowledge no patients became unwell from COVID-19 post-operatively. Additional strategies will be required to reinstate an effective elective orthopaedic service, especially as the nation heads into another wave.","Sharkey, S; Narang, K; Pacheco, R J; Anthony, C",Musculoskelet. surg.

518773,Political institutions and policy responses during a crisis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite the increasingly recognized impact of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on many aspects of health in adults and children, its effects on neonates born to infected mothers remain unclear. We conducted this study to investigate the outcomes of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the medical databases from inception to March 31, 2020 to perform a systematic review of outcomes in neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Data were pooled using a random effects regression model. Primary and secondary outcomes were neonatal clinical outcomes and infectious status, respectively. RESULTS: Fourteen studies involving 105 neonates fulfilling the study criteria were identified. The rates of preterm neonates and those small for gestational age (SGA) were 25 (23.8%) and 10 (11.2%), respectively. Among 91 neonates who were tested, 8 (8.8%) were positive for nucleic acids or antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, 28 (26.7%) of the neonates were symptomatic and two test-negative neonates died, including one stillbirth. Between test-positive and test-negative groups, the rates of SGA, preterm delivery, duration between maternal symptom onset and delivery, and perinatal complication were not significantly different; but the rate of symptomatic after birth reached significant difference (62.5% vs 20.5%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Most neonates born to infected mothers had favorable outcomes. Although direct evidences of intrauterine infection were scarce, the risk of intrauterine infection should be considered based on a positive test in 8.8% of the neonates. Symptomatic neonates born to infected mothers should receive tests for SARS-CoV-2 to initiate appropriate treatment and quarantine. Further studies are warranted to assess the outcomes of COVID-19 in neonates.","Chi, Hsin; Chiu, Nan-Chang; Tai, Yu-Lin; Chang, Hung-Yang; Lin, Chao-Hsu; Sung, Yi-Hsiang; Tseng, Cheng-Yin; Liu, Lawrence Yu-Min; Lin, Chien-Yu",J. microbiol. immunol. infect,,697

These drastic measures were successful in ""flattening the curve"" and maintaining the prior rate of COVID-19 infections and deaths. To date, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on neuro-trauma has not been reported. Methods We retrospectively analyzed hospital admissions from Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital, during the months of March and April from 2016-2020. Specifically, we identified all patients who had cranial neuro trauma consisting of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and/or skull fractures, as well as spinal neuro trauma consisting of vertebral fractures and/or spinal cord injury (SCI). We then performed chart review to determine mechanism of injury and if emergent surgical intervention was required. Results Compared to previous years, we saw a significant decline in the number of neuro-traumas during the pandemic, with a 62% decline after the lockdown began. The number of emergent neuro-trauma surgical cases also significantly decreased by 84% in the month of April. Interestingly, while the number of vehicular traumas decreased by 77%, there was a significant 100% increase in the number of gunshot wounds. Conclusions Population seclusion had a direct effect on the frequency of neuro-trauma, while the change in relative proportion of certain mechanisms may be associated with the psychosocial effects of social distancing and quarantine.","Figueroa, Javier M; Boddu, James; Kader, Michael; Berry, Katherine; Kumar, Vignessh; Ayala, Veronica; Vanni, Steven; Jagid, Jonathan",World neurosurgery (Online),,697
520586,Risk Society and Science Education: Lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"The objectives of this study are to examine the factors affecting the intention and actual usage behavior on mHealth adoption, investigate the effect of actual usage behavior of mHealth on mental well-being of the end-users, and investigate the moderating role of self-quarantine on the intention-actual usage of mHealth under the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic situation. The required primary data were gathered from the end-users of mHealth in Bangladesh. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), this study has confirmed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, and facilitating conditions have a positive influence on behavioral intention whereas health consciousness has an impact on both intention and actual usage behavior. mHealth usage behavior has an affirmative and meaningful effect on the mental well-being of the service users. Moreover, self-quarantine has strong influence on actual usage behavior but does not moderate the intention-behavior relationship. In addition, due to the existence of a non-linearity problem in the data set, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach was engaged to sort out relatively significant predictors acquired from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). However, this study contributes to the emergent mHealth literature by revealing how the use of the mHealth services elevates the quality of patients' mental well-being under this pandemic situation.","Alam, Mirza Mohammad Didarul; Alam, Mohammad Zahedul; Rahman, Syed Abidur; Taghizadeh, Seyedeh Khadijeh",J Biomed Inform,,697

As in the human disease, monocytes, and macrophages in SARS-CoV-2 infected MISTRG6-hACE2 are central to disease pathology. Here, we describe SARS-CoV-2 uptake in tissue resident human macrophages that is enhanced by virus specific antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 replicates in these human macrophages as evidenced by detection of double-stranded RNA, subgenomic viral RNA and expression of a virally encoded fluorescent reporter gene; and it is inhibited by Remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral replication. Although early IFN deficiency leads to enhanced disease, blocking either viral replication with Remdesivir or the downstream IFN stimulated cascade by injecting anti-IFNAR2 in vivo in the chronic stages of disease attenuates many aspects of the overactive immune-inflammatory response, especially the inflammatory macrophage response, and most consequentially, the chronic disease itself.","Sefik, Esen; Qu, Rihao; Kaffe, Eleanna; Zhao, Jun; Mirza, Haris; Brewer, Ricky; Han, Ailin; Steach, Holly; Israelow, Benjamin; Chen, Y.

Here, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of published and purported SARS-CoV-2 antivirals including imatinib mesylate that we found to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication on Vero E6 cells and that, according to the published literature on other coronaviruses is likely to act on-target, as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We identified a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals with characteristics of lysosomotropic agents, meaning that they are lipophilic weak bases capable of penetrating into cells. These agents include cepharentine, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, clemastine, cloperastine, emetine, hydroxychloroquine, haloperidol, ML240, PB28, ponatinib, siramesine, and zotatifin (eFT226) all of which are likely to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by non-specific (off-target) effects, meaning that they probably do not act on their 'official' pharmacological targets, but rather interfere with viral replication through non-specific effects on acidophilic organelles including autophagosomes, endosomes, and lysosomes. Imatinib mesylate did not fall into this cluster. In conclusion, we propose a tentative classification of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals into specific (on-target) versus non-specific (off-target) agents based on their physicochemical characteristics.","Sauvat, Allan; Ciccosanti, Fabiola; Colavita, Francesca; Di Rienzo, Martina; Castilletti, Concetta; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Kepp, Oliver; Zitvogel, Laurence; Fimia, Gian Maria; Piacentini, Mauro; Kroemer, Guido",Cell Death Dis,,697

As pneumonia can affect the cardiovascular system, this study aimed to investigate the performance of the CHA2DS2-VASc score for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) risk stratification in patients with pneumonia. Methods: A retrospective population-based cohort study including 61,843 patients with pneumonia. These patients were divided into two cohorts that were stratified based on the presence or absence of underlying atrial fibrillation (AF). We calculated the CHA2DS2-VASc score and incidence density rates of MACEs in each cohort. Cox regression was conducted to calculate hazard ratio of MACEs in pneumonia patients. The diagnostic performance of CHA2DS2-VASc with regard to MACEs was tested using the receiver operator characteristic curve. Results: Pneumonia patients with higher CHA2DS2-VASc score were more likely develop MACEs in both the AF and non-AF groups.

A number of inhibitors targeting this protein have been developed in the past several years. Recently, a group of small molecules were identified to have inhibitory activity against cathepsin B through high throughput screening (HTS) tests. In this study, traditional continuous and binary QSAR models were built to classify the biological activities of previously identified compounds and to distinguish active compounds from inactive compounds for drug development based on the calculated molecular and physicochemical properties. Strong correlations were obtained for the continuous QSAR models with regression correlation coefficients (r(2)) and cross-validated correlation coefficients (q(2)) of 0.77 and 0.61 for all compounds, and 0.82 and 0.68 for the compound set excluding 3 outliers, respectively. The models were further validated through the leave-one-out (LOO) method and the training-test set method. The binary models demonstrated a strong level of predictability in distinguishing the active compounds from inactive compounds with accuracies of 0.89 and 0.94 for active and inactive compounds, respectively, in non-cross-validated models. Similar results were obtained for the cross-validated models. Collectively, these results demonstrate the models’ ability to discriminate between active and inactive compounds, suggesting that the models may be used to pre-screen compounds to facilitate compound optimization and to design novel inhibitors for drug development.","Zhou, Zhigang; Wang, Yanli; Bryant, Stephen H.",Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2873115?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1093326310000215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20194042/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmgm.2010.01.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1093326310000215,697
592632,"Association between air quality, meteorological factors and COVID-19 infection",2021-03-17,"BACKGROUND: All major guidelines for antihypertensive therapy recommend weight loss. Dietary interventions that aim to reduce body weight might therefore be a useful intervention to reduce blood pressure and adverse cardiovascular events associated with hypertension. OBJECTIVES: Primary objectives To assess the long-term effects of weight-reducing diets in people with hypertension on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and adverse events (including total serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, and total non-serious adverse events). Secondary objectives To assess the long-term effects of weight-reducing diets in people with hypertension on change from baseline in systolic blood pressure, change from baseline in diastolic blood pressure, and body weight reduction. SEARCH METHODS: For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to April 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2020, Issue 3), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers about further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 24 weeks' duration that compared weight-reducing dietary interventions to no dietary intervention in adults with primary hypertension. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed risks of bias and extracted data. Where appropriate and in the absence of significant heterogeneity between studies (P > 0.1), we pooled studies using a fixed-effect meta-analysis. In case of moderate or larger heterogeneity as measured by Higgins I2, we used a random-effects model. MAIN RESULTS: This second review update did not reveal any new trials, so the number of included trials remains the same: eight RCTs involving a total of 2100 participants with high blood pressure and a mean age of 45 to 66 years. Mean treatment duration was 6 to 36 months. We judged the risks of bias as unclear or high for all but two trials. No study included mortality as a predefined outcome. One RCT evaluated the effects of dietary weight loss on a combined endpoint consisting of the necessity of reinstating antihypertensive therapy and severe cardiovascular complications. In this RCT, weight-reducing diet lowered the endpoint compared to no diet: hazard ratio 0.70 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.87). None of the trials evaluated adverse events as designated in our protocol. The certainty of the evidence was low for a blood pressure reduction in participants assigned to weight-loss diets as compared to controls: systolic blood pressure: mean difference (MD) -4.5 mm Hg (95% CI -7.2 to -1.8 mm Hg) (3 studies, 731 participants), and diastolic blood pressure: MD -3.2 mm Hg (95% CI -4.8 to -1.5 mm Hg) (3 studies, 731 participants). We judged the certainty of the evidence to be high for weight reduction in dietary weight loss groups as compared to controls: MD -4.0 kg (95% CI -4.8 to -3.2) (5 trials, 880 participants). Two trials used withdrawal of antihypertensive medication as their primary outcome. Even though we did not consider this a relevant outcome for our review, the results of these RCTs strengthen the finding of a reduction of blood pressure by dietary weight-loss interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In this second update, the conclusions remain unchanged, as we found no new trials. In people with primary hypertension, weight-loss diets reduced body weight and blood pressure, but the magnitude of the effects are uncertain due to the small number of participants and studies included in the analyses. Whether weight loss reduces mortality and morbidity is unknown.

Results: Of 67 included studies, 23 (34%) had no discrepancies in results reporting between preprints and journal publications. Fifteen (22%) studies had at least one outcome that was included in the journal publication, but not the preprint; 8 (12%) had at least one outcome that was reported in the preprint only. For outcomes that were reported in both preprints and journals, common discrepancies were differences in numerical values and statistical significance, additional statistical tests and subgroup analyses conducted in journal publications, and longer follow-up times for outcome assessment in journal publications. At least one instance of spin occurred in both preprints and journals in 23 / 67 (34%) studies, the preprint only in 5 (7%) studies, and the journal publications only in 2 (3%) of studies. Spin was removed between the preprint and journal publication in 5/67 (7%) studies; but added in 1/67 (1%) study. Conclusions: The COVID-19 preprints and their subsequent journal publications were largely similar in reporting of study characteristics, outcomes and spin. All COVID-19 studies published as preprints and journal publications should be critically evaluated for discrepancies and spin.","Bero, L.; Lawrence, R.; Leslie, L.; Chiu, K.; McDonald, S.; Page, M.; Grundy, Q.; Parker, L.; Boughton, S.; Kirkham, J.; Featherstone, R.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.12.21255329; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.12.21255329v1?rss=1,697
599351,Emerging Perspectives in Labour Regulation in the Wake of COVID-19,2020-09-07,"BACKGROUNDS: An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city in China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces/regions of China and other countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R(0), of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak. METHODS: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (γ), we estimated R(0) by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI. FINDINGS: The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R(0) ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96–2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89–4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R(0). CONCLUSION: The mean estimate of R(0) for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and is significantly larger than 1. Our findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks.","Zhao, Shi; Lin, Qianyin; Ran, Jinjun; Musa, Salihu S.; Yang, Guangpu; Wang, Weiming; Lou, Yijun; Gao, Daozhou; Yang, Lin; He, Daihai; Wang, Maggie H.",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.01.050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32007643/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220300539; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220300539,697

Methods: Epidemiological linking and analysis of cases of COVID‐19 across multiple outbreak sites. Results: Fifteen cases of COVID‐19 and 41 contacts were identified and linked in a cluster that included one workplace and five households. The mean incubation period in the cases ranged from 4.6 to 6.4 days, while the median incubation period was shorter, ranging from 3 to 5 days. The overall range of incubation periods was 2 to 12 days. Differential attack rates were found within households (86% adults vs. 9% children) and workplace (32%) settings. Conclusions and implications for public health: Our investigation links cases between multiple households and a workplace. When exploring these links using a rapid workplace assessment, real‐time cluster data along with objective measurements of exposure, such as with the Australian Government COVIDSafe app, may have allowed these links to be identified more readily and potentially reduced further spread of COVID‐19. We found age as a factor for infection, with children being less likely to both acquire SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and to develop symptoms. This finding aids in our understanding of how the virus affects children and cautiously supports face‐to‐face classroom teaching.","Capon, Adam; Ousta, Dima; Ferson, Mark; Ingleton, Andrew; Sheppeard, Vicky",Aust N Z J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617133/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.13081,697

606290,Maintaining efficient logistics and supply chain management operations during and after coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic: learning from the past experiences,2021-01-19,"Providing social security to the population in need has become a major expenditure for many governments. Reducing the number of dependents in the social security system and maintaining a dynamic economically active population is a high priority concern for policymakers. A good understanding of the dynamics of the social security system—specifically, who enters and who exits the system—would be helpful for formulating effective interventions. Here, we made use of the data of Hong Kong’s Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA), which is currently a basic welfare scheme in Hong Kong that provides supplementary payments to households that cannot support themselves financially. We proposed a stochastic model to examine the in- and out- movement in the CSSA scheme and conducted elasticity analyses. The elasticity analyses allowed us to identify the potential target groups of people that would lead to the largest reduction in the number of the CSSA recipients in the system. This analytical method can also reveal whether policies would be more effective in preventing people from entering the CSSA system or helping them leave the CSSA scheme. Our analyses suggest that targeting those aged 30–49 with children would have the largest impact. Additionally, we found that policies that aim to prevent this group from entering the CSSA system would be more effective in reducing the number of CSSA recipients compared with policies that aim to help them exit. In contrast, for the younger age group of 10–29, policies that help them leave CSSA would be more effective than policies that prevent them from entering CSSA. Providing employment for those unemployed in this younger group would be more effective. The results indicate that by tailoring measures to specific subgroups, the overall number of CSSA recipients would be reduced, thereby improving the efficiency of Hong Kong’s social security system, which has accounted for more than 16.5% of Hong Kong government expenditure in 2018, amounting to more than HKD 92 billion.","Yip, Paul; Chen, Mengni; So, Bing Kwan; Lam, Kwok Fai; Wat, Kam Pui",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17041305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32085532/,697

We use a mathematical model to study the dynamics of viral coinfection of the respiratory tract in an effort to understand the kinetics of these infections. Specifically, we use our model to investigate coinfections of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, and human metapneumovirus. Our study shows that during coinfections, one virus can block another simply by being the first to infect the available host cells; there is no need for viral interference through immune response interactions. We use the model to calculate the duration of detectable coinfection and examine how it varies as initial viral dose and time of infection are varied. We find that rhinovirus, the fastest-growing virus, reduces replication of the remaining viruses during a coinfection, while parainfluenza virus, the slowest-growing virus is suppressed in the presence of other viruses.","Pinky, Lubna; Dobrovolny, Hana M.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0155589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27196110/,697

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic search of the literature is conducted in bibliographic databases including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Cochrane and Scientific Information Database using a comprehensive search strategy without time limit until the end of 2018, updated by 1 July 2020, accomplished by reference tracking, author contacting and expert consultation to identify studies on the overuse of medical care. RESULTS: We reviewed 4124 published articles based on predetermined inclusion criteria. The author’s consensus included a total of 41 articles. Of these, 32 were in English and 9 in Farsi, published between 1975–2019. The result categorized into two distinct clinical areas: treatment (18 articles) and diagnostic (23 articles) services. Almost all of the studies only described the magnitude of unnecessary overuse. Unnecessary overuse of antibiotics, MRI, and CT-scan were the most reported topics. The ranges of their overuse proportion were as follows: antibiotic (31 to 97%); MRI (33 to 88%), and CT-scan (19 to 50%). CONCLUSION: Our review showed, even so, the magnitude of unnecessary overuse of medical services is high but there are only a few interventional studies in clinical and administrative level for finding effective methods for decreasing these unnecessary services. Researchers should be encouraged to conducting interventional studies. We suggest the ministry of health to use the golden opportunity of COVID-19 epidemic for designing Iran national policy and action plan for controlling and preventing unnecessary healthcare services and including a section for “Interventional Research” in the action plan.","Pezeshki, Mohammad Zakaria; Janati, Ali; Arab-Zozani, Morteza",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s262908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32848487/,697

Healthcare workers (HCWs) who took low-dose corticosteroid agents around the time of the first dose of ChAd (ChAdPd group) were recruited and the reactogenicity and immunogenicity were compared with those of ChAd (ChAd group) and BNT162b2 vaccination (BNT group) of HCWs without corticosteroid exposure. The immunogenicity was measured three weeks after vaccination using quantitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) antibody electrochemiluminescence immunoassay and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release assay. A total of 67 HCWs comprising 24 ChAd, 29 BNT, and 14 ChAdPd was included. The median total corticosteroid dose of the ChAdPd group was 30 mg prednisolone equivalents (interquartile range (IQR) 20–71.3 mg). HCWs in the ChAdPd group experienced significantly milder reactogenicity (median total score 7.5, IQR 4.0–18.0) compared to those in the ChAd group (median 23.0, IQR 8.0–43.0, P=0.012) but similar to that in the BNT group (median 5.0, IQR 3.0–9.0, P=0.067). The S antibody concentration of the ChAdPd group (62.4 ± 70.0 U/mL) was higher than that of the ChAd group, though without statistical significance (3.45 ± 57.6 U/mL, P=0.192). The cellular immune response was most robust in the ChAdPd group, with significantly higher IFN-γ concentration (5.363 ± 4.276 IU/mL), compared to the ChAd (0.978 ± 1.181 IU/mL, P=0.002) and BNT (1.656 ± 1.925 IU/mL, P=0.009) groups.

The 2003 infectious outbreak of SARS-CoV had a negative impact on blood supply. This study aimed to measure donor attendance and blood demand in order to help find efficient ways of managing blood supply and demand during the COVID-19 pandemic and similar public emergencies in the future. Materials and methods Data from donor attendance, mobile blood drives and blood inventory records were retrospectively obtained for the period between 1 September 2019 and 1 May 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on donor attendance and the management of blood supply and demand in King Abdullah Hospital, Bisha, Saudi Arabia. Data were analysed using SPSSStatistics, version 25.0. Categorical variables were described using frequencies and percentages. Results After imported cases of COVID-19 were reported in Saudi Arabia, donor attendance and blood supply at blood bank-based collections showed a drop of 39.5%. On the other hand, blood demand during the same period was reduced by 21.7%. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on donor attendance and blood supply and adversely affected blood transfusion services. Guidelines that prioritize blood transfusion should prepare at the beginning of emergencies similar to this pandemic. Close monitoring of blood needs and blood supply and appropriate response is essential for avoiding sudden blood shortage.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multifaceted, dynamic methodology, iteratively gathering cognitive, emotional and social insights, was used to support and conduct in-depth, immersion interviews across the USA with 59 HCPs in-office and in roundtable discussions, and 20 patient-support partner dyads in-home. RESULTS: Patients were aged >18 years, primarily female, and all were diagnosed with CRPS (limited to type 1 in this patient cohort). Results show that the current state of CRPS treatment may fall short in multiple key areas. In some cases, poor awareness of CRPS causes delayed diagnoses impacting the opportunity for early treatment, resulting in long-term poor health outcomes. Consequently, the CRPS “patient journey” may be characterized by clinical frustration of physicians and disappointment for some patients. The poor treatment experiences and outcomes for some patients and HCPs may build the perception of a non-collaborative relationship. HCPs and patients agree that an effective treatment would be one that addresses CRPS rather than its symptoms, and the availability of such an option would transform the treatment experience. CONCLUSION: CRPS leads to cognitive, social and emotional burdens for patients and their caregivers. There is an unmet need for improved CRPS disease awareness and successful therapeutic options to aid in earlier diagnoses, effective treatment and better outcomes for HCPs, patients, and their caregivers.","Raja, Srinivasa N; Buvanendran, Asokumar; Marcondes, Lizandra",J Pain Res,https://doi.org/10.2147/jpr.s317648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34408484/,697

While the Agence de la biomedecine in agreement with the French lung transplant community has limited the transplant program to patients with high-urgency status during the first epidemic wave, the program has been fully restored where possible during the second epidemic wave. This study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 on new listings, waitlist outcomes and transplant activity in France. Methods All patients newly registered on the national waiting list for lung transplantation between January and September 2018-2020 were included in the study (n=878). The numbers of new listings and transplants per million population (pmp) in 2018-2019 period and in 2020 COVID era were compared. Cumulative incidence of transplantation and waitlist mortality estimated with the competing risk analysis with transplantation and death or delisting for medical condition as the competing events were compared between the study periods. Results In 2020 compared with the 2018-2019 period, the total number of patients newly registered on the waiting list declined 34%, from 4.9 to 3.2 pmp and the number of transplants performed decreased 31%, from 3.9 to 2.6 pmp. While 3-month cumulative incidence of transplantation (Figure 1) decreased from 54% [51-58] to 46% [39-53], no difference in cumulative incidence of death or delisting for medical condition (3% [2-4] versus 4% [2-8]) (Figure 2) was observed between the periods.

Many studies highlighted the regulatory potential of UV-B treatment towards the secondary metabolism of plants. In the present study, we examined the impact of UV-B on the physiology and secondary metabolism of Withania coagulans, which is an important ayurvedic plant with high anti-diabetic potential. Results showed that in-vitro UV-B exposure negatively influenced chlorophyll content and photosynthetic machinery. However, Fv/Fm ratio was found non-significantly altered up to 3 h UV-B exposure. The maximum lipid peroxidation level was recorded with 46.8% higher malondialdehyde content in the plants supplemented with 5 h UV-B radiation, that was indicated the oxidative stress in W. coagulans. Conversely, UV-B treatment significantly increased the plant's stress protective compounds like carotenoids, anthocyanin, phenol and proline, in W. coagulans. Free radical scavenging activity was also significantly increased ~ 18% than the control with 3 h UV-B treatment. The maximum antioxidative enzymes activities were observed with the short-term (up to 3 h) UV-B treatment. Specifically, UV-B radiation exposure significantly increased the content of withaferin A and withanolide A in W. coagulans with maximum 1.38 and 3.42-folds, respectively. Additionally, withanolides biosynthesis related genes transcript levels were found over-expressed under the response of UV-B elicitation. The acquired results suggested that short-term UV-B supplementation triggers secondary metabolism along with combating oxidative stress via improving the antioxidative defense system in W. coagulans.

619769,Drivers for the poor air quality conditions in north China Plain during the COVID-19 outbreak,2020-11-25,"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging coronavirus involved in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and rapid renal failure. Hospital outbreak and nosocomial transmission were reported, however, several issues remain on the viral excretion course. OBJECTIVES: Describe the kinetics and pattern of viral excretion in two infected patients. STUDY DESIGN: After the initial diagnosis, blood, urine, rectal and respiratory samples were collected regularly, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay targeted the UpE and Orf1a regions of the MERS-CoV genome. RESULTS: In patient 1, who died of refractory ARDS and renal failure, MERS-CoV RNA was detected in pharyngeal and tracheal swabs, as well blood samples and urine samples until the 30th day. Rectal swabs were negative. Patient 2 also developed multiple-organ failure, but survived, with persisting renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance at 30 mL/min) and persistent interstitial syndrome albeit weaned off mechanical ventilation and no longer requiring oxygen. Tracheal aspirations were positive until the 33rd day, while nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. All other biological samples were negative. DISCUSSION: Lower respiratory tract excretion of MERS-CoV could be observed for more than one month. The most severely ill patient presented an expression of the virus in blood and urine, consistent with a type-1 interferon mediated immunological response impaired in patient 1, but developed by patient 2. These results suggest that infection control precautions must be adequately evaluated in clinical wards and laboratories exposed to MERS-CoV.","Poissy, J.; Goffard, A.; Parmentier-Decrucq, E.; Favory, R.; Kauv, M.; Kipnis, E.; Mathieu, D.; Guery, B.",J Clin Virol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214002650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073585/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214002650; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.07.002,697
620090,"Migration in Northeast India: Inflows, Outflows and Reverse Flows during Pandemic",2020-10-24,"Certain sulfated glycans, including those from marine sources, can show potential effects against SARS-CoV-2. Here, a new fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (FucCS) from the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) (MW∼10-60 kDa) was isolated and structurally characterized by NMR. PpFucCS is composed of {→3)-β-GalNAcX-(1→4)-β-GlcA-[(3→1)Y]-(1→}, where X = 4S (80%) or 6S (10%), Y = α-Fuc2,4S (40%), α-Fuc2,4S-(1→4)-α-Fuc (30%), or α-Fuc4S (30%), and S = SO(3)(-). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of PpFucCS, and those of the FucCS and sulfated fucan isolated from Isostichopus badionotus (IbFucCS and IbSF), were compared to that of heparin. IC(50) values demonstrated the activity of the three holothurian sulfated glycans to be ∼12 times more efficient than heparin, with no cytotoxic effects. The dissociation constant (K(D)) values obtained by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the wild type SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and N501Y mutant RBD in interactions with the heparin-immobilized sensor chip were 94 and 1.8 × 10(3) nM, respectively. Competitive SPR inhibition analysis of PpFucCS, IbFucCS, and IbSF against heparin binding to wild type S-protein showed IC(50) values (in the nM range) 6, 25, and 6 times more efficient than heparin, respectively. Data from computational simulations suggest an influence of the sulfation patterns of the Fuc units on hydrogen bonding with GlcA, and that conformational change of some of the oligosaccharide structures occurs upon S-protein RBD binding. Compared to heparin, negligible anticoagulant action was observed for IbSF. Our results suggest that IbSF may represent a promising molecule for future investigations against SARS-CoV-2.","Dwivedi, Rohini; Samanta, Priyanka; Sharma, Poonam; Zhang, Fuming; Mishra, Sushil K.; Kucheryavy, Pavel; Kim, Seon Beom; Aderibigbe, AyoOluwa O.; Linhardt, Robert J.; Tandon, Ritesh; Doerksen, Robert J.; Pomin, Vitor H.",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34537241/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925821010097?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925821010097; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2021.101207,697

Influenza-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe COVID-19 patients are both at risk of developing invasive fungal diseases. We used the new international definitions of influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) and COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) to compare the demographic, clinical, biological, and radiological aspects of IAPA and CAPA in a monocentric retrospective study. A total of 120 patients were included, 71 with influenza and 49 with COVID-19-associated ARDS. Among them, 27 fulfilled the newly published criteria of IPA: 17/71 IAPA (23.9%) and 10/49 CAPA (20.4%). Kaplan–Meier curves showed significantly higher 90-day mortality for IPA patients overall (p = 0.032), whereas mortality did not differ between CAPA and IAPA patients. Radiological findings showed differences between IAPA and CAPA, with a higher proportion of features suggestive of IPA during IAPA. Lastly, a wide proportion of IPA patients had low plasma voriconazole concentrations with a higher delay to reach concentrations > 2 mg/L in CAPA vs. IAPA patients (p = 0.045). Severe COVID-19 and influenza patients appeared very similar in terms of prevalence of IPA and outcome.

However, various plant species are able to effectively capture and reduce atmospheric PM concentrations. We investigated the indoor growth and morphology of 21 indigenous Korean evergreen species at low light intensities to ascertain their ability to reduce PM of aerosol particles in a closed acrylic chamber. The decrease in PM mass concentration differed significantly across species, with a significant correlation (8 h; p < 0.001). The reduction in the mass concentration of PM differed with particle size and across species. The highest reduction of PM(2.5) occurred after 8 h with Dryopteris lacera (86.8%), Ilex × wandoensis (84.9%), Machilus thunbergii (84.3%), and Rhododendron brachycarpum (84.0%). Reduction of PM(10) after 8 h was highest with Cephalotaxus harringtonii (98.3%), I. × wandoensis (98.5%), M. thunbergii (98.5%), and R. brachycarpum (98.3%). Plant morphological characteristics (category, plant height, leaf shape, leaf area) and relative humidity were closely related to the decrease in PM mass concentration.

However, the composition of other immune components in CCP and their potential roles remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to describe the composition and concentrations of plasma cytokines and chemokines in eligible CCP donors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 20 pre-pandemic healthy blood donors without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 140 eligible CCP donors with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Electrochemiluminescence detection based multiplexed sandwich immunoassays were used to quantify plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations (n=35 analytes). A SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assay was also performed. Differences in the percent detection and distribution of cytokine and chemokine concentrations were examined by categorical groups using Fisher’s exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, respectively. RESULTS: Among CCP donors (n=140), the median time since molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was 44 days(interquartile range=38-50) and 9%(n=12) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. Compared to healthy blood donor controls, CCP donors had significantly higher plasma levels of IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-15, IL-21 and MCP-1, but lower levels of IL-1RA, IL-8, IL-16, and VEGF-A(P<0.0014). Significant differences were also observed in plasma levels of IL-8, IL-15 and IP-10 between CCP donors with low(<40) vs. high(≥160) anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers(P<0.0014). The median levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IL-12/IL23p40, MDC were significantly higher among CCP donors who were hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized(P<0.05).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the responsiveness and validity of depression, anxiety and stress in a representative cohort of Hellenic military personnel using the short version of the Greek military version of the Depression–Anxiety–Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) questionnaire. METHODS: A total of 158 participants were voluntarily surveyed using an electronically developed structured questionnaire. The anonymous e-questionnaire included a social demographic section and the DASS-21 scale section. It was distributed in September 2020 to the military personnel of the Hellenic Tactical Air Force Units using an intranet network during government restrictive measures due to the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS: Our DASS-21 survey indicated a positive outcome at the psychometric level of our military sample population. Age, sex and systemic medications were statistically correlated with anxiety. Inter-correlations between the DASS-21 statements showed that individuals with low-level depression also experienced some degree of stress. Factor analysis indicated the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: The low levels of depression and stress among our military sample population demonstrate the importance of periodic monitoring of the psychometric items of the DASS-21 subscales to design and implement psychological prevention strategies, especially during the ongoing and future healthcare crises.","Kotoulas, Athanasios S; Karamanavis, D; Lambrou, G Ι; Karanikas, P",BMJ Mil Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34266974/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2021-001874,697

Enrollees were divided in low exposure and medium-high groups on the basis of their work activity. Antibody responders were re-contacted after 3 months for the follow-up. Of 2255 sampled workers, 4.8% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies, with 81.7% to IgG only. Workers who continued to go to their place of work, were healthcare workers, or experienced at least one COVID-19-related symptom were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

We use daily new case counts of COVID-19 patients reported by local health administrations from different Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) within the US to parametrize a simple model that well describes the propagation of the disease in each area. We then introduce a time-varying control input that represents the level of social distancing imposed on the population of a given area and solve an optimal control problem with the goal of minimizing the impact of social distancing on the economy in the presence of relevant constraints, such as a desired level of suppression for the epidemics at a terminal time. We find that with the exception of the initial time and of the final time, the optimal control input is well approximated by a constant variable which is specific to each area. For all the areas considered, this optimal level corresponds to stricter social distancing than the `current' level estimated from data. Proper selection of the time period for application of the control action optimally is important: depending on the particular MSA this period should be either short or long or intermediate. Finally, we see that small deviations from the optimal solution can lead to dramatic violations of the constraints.","Shirin, A.; Lin, Y.

The rates of vaccine hesitancy across high-income countries or regions ranged from 7–77.9%. 46 studies (47.4%) had rates of 30% and more. Younger age, females, not being of white ethnicity and lower education were common contextual factors associated with increased vaccine hesitancy. Lack of recent history of influenza vaccination, lower self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, lesser fear of COVID-19, believing that COVID-19 is not severe and not having chronic medical conditions were most frequently studied individual/group factors associated with increased vaccine hesitancy. Common vaccine-specific factors associated with increased vaccine hesitancy included beliefs that vaccine are not safe/effective and increased concerns about rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines.

Compliance with these measures requires voluntary cooperation from citizens. Yet, compliance is not complete. Existing research on the predictors of compliance is almost exclusively based on cross-sectional data, raising the possibility of reverse causality and confounding . Methods : Using data from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study, a large weekly online panel of UK adults from first three months of lockdown in the UK (n = 51,600), we tested whether within-person changes in confidence in government, mental wellbeing, social experiences and awareness of COVID-19 were longitudinally related to self-reported compliance levels with guidelines from authorities using random intercept cross-lagged panel models . Findings : We found evidence of a small longitudinal association between increased confidence in government to tackle the pandemic and higher self-reported compliance, but little evidence that factors such as mental health and wellbeing, worries about future adversities, and social isolation and loneliness were related to later compliance. We found higher self-reported compliance was longitudinally related to higher depressive symptoms. We found that low compliance was related to lower leisure engagement, providing care, and working outside the home .

634518,Effects of COVID-19 lockdown phases in India: an atmospheric perspective,2021-01-06,"Emerging infectious diseases such as SARS and the bioterror attacks with anthrax spores that occurred after September 11th, 2001 have highlighted the need to be better prepared for the detection and management of infectious pathogens that threaten public health. Negative staining electron microscopy is one method used to screen environmental and clinical samples for relevant infectious pathogens. Unfortunately, bacterial endospores, like those of Bacillus anthracis, are difficult to identify using this method because of their density that prevents imaging of structural details. Thin section electron microscopy would be an alternative method but this usually requires a few days for preparation and diagnosis. In the present paper we describe the development of a rapid thin section protocol, using mainly Bacillus subtilis spores as a model, which allows an unequivocal diagnosis of endospores within 2 h. The protocol involves chemical fixation assisted by heat or microwaves, rapid dehydration, embedding in the low-viscosity resin LR White and chemically enhanced polymerization. Structural preservation of spores is comparable to preservation after standard Epon embedding. Immunolabeling experiments using B. atrophaeus spores and a specific antibody suggest that the protocol preserves significant antigenicity for on-section immunocytochemistry and therefore offers the possibility for the strain typing of spores using specific antibodies. Further experiments with vegetative bacteria, viruses and cell cultures indicate that the rapid thin section protocol not only preserves spores but also other biological structures. Because of its universality and speed the described protocol complements negative staining electron microscopy as a front line method for the morphology-based diagnosis of pathogens in environmental and clinical samples.","Laue, Michael; Niederwöhrmeier, Bärbel; Bannert, Norbert",J Microbiol Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17466397/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167701207000954; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701207000954,697
635368,Cocooning is essential to relaxing social distancing,2020-05-08,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Recently, several studies have shown that acidosis, which is increased acidity in the blood and other body tissues, is often associated with severe COVID-19. In this article, we look at the mechanisms and consequences of acidosis that can lead to an exacerbation of COVID-19. We want to draw the attention of readers to the threshold values of such disease characteristics as hypoxia and acidosis, which are associated with a sharp deterioration in the patient’s condition. Hypoxia and acidosis mutually reinforce each other according to the principle of a vicious cycle (that is, they are involved in a system of positive feedbacks). Elevated blood lactate (lactic acid) levels are associated with poor clinical outcomes in COVID patients. As a practical recommendation, we propose to pay more attention to the prevention of acidosis, including in the early stages of the disease, when the adjustment of homeostasis requires less effort and is less risky. ABSTRACT: COVID-19 has specific characteristics that distinguish this disease from many other infections. We suggest that the pathogenesis of severe forms of COVID-19 can be associated with acidosis. This review article discusses several mechanisms potentially linking the damaging effects of COVID-19 with acidosis and shows the existence of a vicious cycle between the development of hypoxia and acidosis in COVID-19 patients. At the early stages of the disease, inflammation, difficulty in gas exchange in the lungs and thrombosis collectively contribute to the onset of acidosis. In accordance with the Verigo-Bohr effect, a decrease in blood pH leads to a decrease in oxygen saturation, which contributes to the exacerbation of acidosis and results in a deterioration of the patient’s condition. A decrease in pH can also cause conformational changes in the S-protein of the virus and thus lead to a decrease in the affinity and avidity of protective antibodies. Hypoxia and acidosis lead to dysregulation of the immune system and multidirectional pro- and anti-inflammatory reactions, resulting in the development of a “cytokine storm”. In this review, we highlight the potential importance of supporting normal blood pH as an approach to COVID-19 therapy.","Nechipurenko, Yury D.; Semyonov, Denis A.; Lavrinenko, Igor A.; Lagutkin, Denis A.; Generalov, Evgenii A.; Zaitceva, Anna Y.; Matveeva, Olga V.; Yegorov, Yegor E.",Biology (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10090852; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34571729/,697

OBJECTIVE: We compared daily large-scale RT–PCR test results to monitor recent reports of anosmia through a web-based app to assess the dynamics of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions among individuals with COVID-19 in France. METHODS: Between March 21 and November 18, 2020, users of the maladiecoronavirus.fr self-triage app were asked questions about COVID-19 symptoms. Data on daily hospitalizations, large-scale positive results on RT–PCR tests, emergency department visits, and ICU admission of individuals with COVID-19 were compared to data on daily reports of anosmia on the app. RESULTS: As of November 18, 2020, recent anosmia was reported 575,214 times from among approximately 13,000,000 responses. Daily anosmia reports during peak engagement with the app on September 16, 2020, were spatially correlated with the peak in daily COVID-19–related hospitalizations in November 2020 (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [ρ]=0.77; P<.001). This peak in daily anosmia reports was observed primarily among young adults (age range 18-40 years), being observed 49 days before the peak of hospitalizations that corresponded to the first wave of infections among the young population, followed by a peak in hospitalizations among older individuals (aged ≥50 years) in November 2020. The reduction in the daily reports of anosmia associated with the peaks in the number of cases preceded the reduction in daily hospitalizations by 10 and 9 days during the first and the second waves of infection, respectively, although the reduction in the positivity rates on RT–PCR tests preceded the reduction in daily hospitalizations by only 2 days during the second wave of infections. CONCLUSIONS: Data on daily reports of anosmia collected through a nationwide, web-based self-assessment app can be a relevant tool to anticipate surges in outbreaks, hospitalizations, and ICU admission during the COVID-19 pandemic.

They play a key role in advanced studies of genomics. However, existing pathway analytics methods are inadequate to extract meaningful biological structure underneath the network of pathways. They also lack automation. Given these circumstances, we have come up with a novel graph theoretic method to analyze disease-related genes through weighted network of biological pathways. The method automatically extracts biological structures, such as clusters of pathways and their relevance, significance of each pathway and gene, and so forth hidden in the complex network.

Since then, it has spread the length and breadth of the world at an unprecedented, alarming rate. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, which causes COVID-19, has much in common with its closest homologs, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV. The virus–host interaction of SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor, ACE2, which is similar to that of SARS-CoV, which spreads through the respiratory tract. Patients with COVID-19 report symptoms including mild-to-severe fever, cough and fatigue; very few patients report gastrointestinal infections. There are no specific antiviral strategies. A few strong medications are under investigation, so we have to focus on proposals which ought to be taken to forestall this infection in a living host.","Haque, SK Manirul; Ashwaq, Omar; Sarief, Abdulla; Azad John Mohamed, Abdul Kalam",Future virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33224265/; https://doi.org/10.2217/fvl-2020-0124,697

The need for an effective vaccine to curb this pandemic cannot be overemphasized. In view of this, we, therefore, designed a subcomponent antigenic peptide vaccine targeting the N-terminal (NT) and C-terminal (CT) RNA binding domains of nucleocapsid protein that aid in viral replication. Promising antigenic B-cells and T cell epitopes were predicted using computational pipelines. The peptides “RIRGGDGKMKDL” and “AFGRRGPEQTQGNFG” were the B cell linear epitopes with good antigenic index and non-allergenic property. Two CD8+ and Three CD4+ T-cell epitopes were also selected considering their safe immunogenic profiling such as allergenicity, antigen level conservancy, antigenicity, peptide toxicity, and putative restrictions to a number of MHC-I and II alleles. With these selected epitopes, a non-allergenic chimeric peptide vaccine incapable of inducing a Type II hypersensitivity reaction was constructed. The molecular interaction between the toll-like receptor-5 (TLR5) which was triggered by the vaccine was analyzed by molecular docking and scrutinized using dynamics simulation. Finally, in silico cloning was performed to ensure the expression and translation efficiency of the vaccine, utilizing pET-28a vector.

643637,COVID-19 and the abrupt shift to remote learning: Impact on grades and perceived learning for undergraduate biology students,2021-03-29,"BACKGROUND Relational and emotional problems, dysregulation, self-harming or substance abuse often characterize personality disorders (PD). In Norway, COVID-19 restrictions led to an abrupt shutdown of services from 12 March 2020 also including specialized PD treatments. AIMS The objective of this study was to investigate social and mental distress among patients with PDs during the first COVID-19 wave. DESIGN A survey was distributed after the first COVID-19 wave (June-October 2020) among 1120 patients from 12 PD treatment units. RESULTS The response rate was 12% (N = 133). The survey reflected impairment of occupational activity (53% <50% activity last 6 months), life quality (EQ-5D-VAS: 56, SD 19), and personality functioning (LPFS-BF ≥12: 81%, 35% avoidant PD, 44% borderline PD) and high levels of depression and anxiety (PHQ-9 ≥ 10: 84%, GAD-7 ≥ 10: 68%), 49% with health-related anxiety. Problem increase was reported for anxiety (28%), depression (24%), aggression (23%), substance use (14%), and 70% of parents had more child-care difficulties. Self-destructive behaviors (26%) did not increase. The majority (78%) reported increased or unchanged social isolation and loneliness. Occupational activity declined with negative effects on part-time jobs/rehabilitation. Therapist contact was mainly telephone-based (63% ≥ weekly contact). More severe personality problems, current depressive symptoms, and self-harming before 12 March were associated with more frequent consultations. CONCLUSION The survey confirms severe, enhanced levels of mental distress among patients receiving telephone-based consultations as the main alternative to specialized PD treatment during the COVID-19 shutdown. The most vulnerable patients received more frequent consultations and self-destructive actions did not increase.","Hartveit Kvarstein, Elfrida; Zahl, Kjell-Einar; Stänicke, Line Indrevoll; Pettersen, Mona Skjeklesæther; Baltzersen, Åse-Line; Johansen, Merete Selsbak; Eikenæs, Ingeborg Ulltveit-Moe; Hummelen, Benjamin; Wilberg, Theresa; Ajo Arnevik, Espen; Pedersen, Geir",Nordic journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1080/08039488.2021.1942980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369842/,697
647476,Social distancing in apheresis medicine,2020-11-20,"Background: Serology testing is explored for epidemiological research and to inform individuals after suspected infection. During the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline healthcare professionals (HCP) may be at particular risk for infection. No longitudinal data on functional seroconversion in HCP in regions with low COVID-19 prevalence and low pre-test probability exist. Methods: In a large German university hospital, we performed weekly questionnaire assessments and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG measurements with various commercial tests, a novel surrogate virus neutralization test, and a neutralization assay using live SARS-CoV-2. Results: From baseline to week six, n=1,080 screening measurements for anti-SARS CoV-2 (S1) IgG from n=217 frontline HCP (65% female) were performed. Overall, 75.6% of HCP reported at least one symptom of respiratory infection. Self-perceived infection probability declined over time (from mean 20.1% at baseline to 12.4 % in week six, p<0.001). In sera of convalescent PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, we measured high anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, obtained highly concordant results from ELISAs using e.g. the S1 spike protein domain and the nucleocapsid protein (NCP) as targets, and confirmed antiviral neutralization. However, in HCP the cumulative incidence for anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S1) IgG was 1.86% for positive and 0.93% for equivocal positive results over the six week study period. Except for one HCP, none of the eight initial positive results were confirmed by alternative serology tests or showed in vitro neutralization against live SARS CoV-2. The only true seroconversion occurred without symptoms and mounted strong functional humoral immunity. Thus, the confirmed cumulative incidence for neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.47%. Conclusion: When assessing anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune status in individuals with low pre-test probability, we suggest confirming positive results from single measurements by alternative serology tests or functional assays. Our data highlight the need for a methodical serology screening approach in regions with low SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.","Behrens, G. M.; Cossmann, A.; Stankov, M.

647569,Social distancing is a social dilemma game played by every individual against his/her population,2021-08-02,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a rapid and widespread application of telemedicine services in the outpatient setting. Prior to COVID-19, patient satisfaction was measured with Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Clinician & Group Survey (CG-CAHPS) and was then measured with the Press Ganey telemedicine survey. Both surveys ask about a patient’s likelihood to recommend a particular medical practice, which is a useful, but imperfect, surrogate for overall satisfaction. The purpose of this analysis was to identify any changes in patient satisfaction scores with the implementation of telemedicine services. A retrospective analysis of our institution’s experience during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the months immediately prior to the pandemic was conducted. The percent of patients with a “Top box” response to survey questions regarding their likelihood to recommend a medical practice were compared. A total of 14 430 CG-CAHPS results collected in November 2019 through February 2020 were compared to 22 009 telemedicine survey results collected between March and May 2020. In general, most medical specialties incorporated telemedicine but suffered a decrease in their patient’s likelihood to recommend a medical practice during the first few months of the pandemic. However, the magnitude of this decrease was variable by medical specialty. Physical medicine and rehabilitation and pain medicine had relatively poor scores prior to the pandemic which did not statistically change. Oncology was the sole medical specialty that continued to have unchanged high patient satisfaction scores. These data provide insights for the refinement of telemedicine.","Maher, Dermot P; Hess, Demere; Edwards, Chevaune; Allen, Lisa",J Patient Exp,https://doi.org/10.1177/23743735211034610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377775/,697

Little is known about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the behavior and fears of pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and their families. We conducted a survey to determine the COVID-19 exposure, related perceptions, and information sources; medication compliance; and patients' and parents' behaviors, fears, and physician contact. METHODS: An anonymous cross-sectional survey of pediatric patients with IBD and their parents at one pediatric gastroenterology unit of a university medical center was performed. RESULTS: A total of 46 pediatric patients with IBD and 44 parents completed the survey. Parents of pediatric patients with IBD had high fear of their children becoming infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. They perceived schools as the most hazardous environment, whereas the children did not. Half the pediatric patients with IBD feared infection. Patients and parents felt sufficiently informed about COVID-19. The primary source of guidance for pediatric patients was their parents (43%), followed by television and social media, whereas the parents mainly consulted internet news websites (52.2%), television, and public health institutes. Pediatric patients with IBD adhered to their prescribed medication. They also showed cautious behavior by enhancing hand hygiene (84%) and leaving the house less frequently than before. However, in-person medical visits remained favored over video consultations. CONCLUSION: Although parents expressed overprotective concerns, both parents and pediatric patients with IBD are coping well with the COVID-19 pandemic. IBD-relevant information should be actively conveyed.","Reinsch, Steffen; Stallmach, Andreas; Grunert, Philip Christian",Pediatr Gastroenterol Hepatol Nutr,https://doi.org/10.5223/pghn.2021.24.1.65; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33505895/,697

Efficient, effective and economically feasible methods for large-scale PPE decontamination are urgently needed. Aims: (1) to develop protocols for effectively decontaminating PPE using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP); (2) to develop novel approaches that decrease set up and take down time while also increasing decontamination capacity (3) to test decontamination efficiency for N95 respirators heavily contaminated by makeup or moisturizers. Methods: We converted a decommissioned Biosafety Level 3 laboratory into a facility that could be used to decontaminate N95 respirators. N95 respirators were hung on metal racks, stacked in piles, placed in paper bags or covered with makeup or moisturizer. A VHP VICTORYTM unit from STERIS was used to inject VHP into the facility. Biological and chemical indicators were used to validate the decontamination process. Findings: N95 respirators individually hung on metal racks were successfully decontaminated using VHP. N95 respirators were also successfully decontaminated when placed in closed paper bags or if stacked in piles of up to six. Stacking reduced the time needed to arrange N95 respirators for decontamination by approximately two-thirds while almost tripling facility capacity. Makeup and moisturizer creams did not interfere with the decontamination process. Conclusions: Respirator stacking can reduce the hands-on time and increase decontamination capacity. When personalization is needed, respirators can be decontaminated in labeled paper bags.

From these, 928 high quality genomes were generated. Certain viral lineages bearing spike mutations, defined in part by L452R, S13I, and W152C, comprised 54.4% of the total sequences from January, compared to 15.7% in November. Household contacts exposed to the “California” or “West Coast” variants (B.1.427 and B.1.429) were at higher risk of infection compared to household contacts exposed to lineages lacking these variants (0.36 vs 0.29, RR=1.28; 95% CI:1.00-1.64).

Objective: To evaluate the effects of school-based family health education via WeChat in raising parents' awareness of myopia prevention and behavior and in controlling the development of myopia in children. Design, Setting, and Participants: A single-masked cluster randomized clinical trial of children was conducted from October 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020, among grade 1 students from 12 primary schools in Guangzhou, China. The 12 primary schools were randomly selected in 2 districts and randomized to the intervention and control groups. All grade 1 students were invited to participate, and 688 students were included in the intervention group and 752 in the control group. Interventions: Weekly health education via the social media platform WeChat was provided to the parents in the intervention group. Main Outcomes and Measures: Data include results of eye examinations of children and questionnaires completed by parents. The primary outcome was the 2-year cumulative incidence rate of myopia. Myopia was defined as a spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error (sphere of +0.5 cylinder) of at least -0.50 diopters (D). The secondary outcomes were the 2-year changes in the axis length and SE refraction, parental awareness, children's screen time, outdoor activities, and learning tools during COVID-19. Results: Among the 1525 children included at baseline (835 boys [54.8%]; mean [SD] age, 6.3 [0.5] years), 1244 competed the final assessment; the 2-year cumulative incidence rate of myopia was 106 of 544 (19.5%) in the intervention group and 171 of 700 (24.4%) in the control group (difference, 4.9% [95% CI, 0.3%-9.5%]; P = .04). The mean myopic shift in SE refraction in the intervention group (-0.82 D) was lower than that in the control group (-0.96 D; difference, -0.14 [95% CI, -0.22 to -0.06] D; P < .001). No difference in change in axial length was detected (difference, 0.02 [95% CI, -0.06 to 0.09] mm; P = .70). Conclusions and Relevance: School-based weekly family health education via WeChat resulted in a small decrease in the 2-year cumulative incidence rate of myopia with a difference in SE of less than 0.25 D not accompanied by any axial length differences.

METHODS: We collect two groups of cases diagnosed with COVID-19 for experiments. One group collected 63 samples for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG and IgM antibodies. The other group collected 91 plasma samples for colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA). RESULTS: The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and ELISA IgG detection was 55/63 ( 87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and GICA IgG detection was 75/91 ( 82.4%), Both methods are negative for healthy controls, specificity of 100% .There is no significant difference between the sensitivity of between ELISA and GICA (IgM+ IgG). CONCLUSIONS: ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies are conventional serological assays, they are simple, fast, and safe, the results can be used for clinical reference, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be greatly relieved.","Xiang, Jie; Yan, Mingzhe; Li, Hongze; Liu, Ting; Lin, Chenyao; Huang, Shuang; Shen, Changxin",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028787,697

656497,Establishing Objective Measures of Clinical Competence in Undergraduate Medical Education through Immersive Virtual Reality,2020-10-20,"OBJECTIVES: ST-246 is one of the key antivirals being developed to fight orthopoxvirus (OPV) infections. Its exact mode of action is not completely understood, but it has been reported to interfere with the wrapping of infectious virions, for which F13L (peripheral membrane protein) and B5R (type I glycoprotein) are required. Here we monitored the appearance of ST-246 resistance to identify its molecular target. METHODS: Vaccinia virus (VACV), cowpox virus (CPXV) and camelpox virus (CMLV) with reduced susceptibility to ST-246 were selected in cell culture and further characterized by antiviral assays and immunofluorescence. A panel of recombinant OPVs was engineered and a putative 3D model of F13L coupled with molecular docking was used to visualize drug–target interaction. The F13L gene of 65 CPXVs was sequenced to investigate F13L amino acid heterogeneity. RESULTS: Amino acid substitutions or insertions were found in the F13L gene of six drug-resistant OPVs and production of four F13L-recombinant viruses confirmed their role(s) in the occurrence of ST-246 resistance. F13L, but not B5R, knockout OPVs showed resistance to ST-246. ST-246 treatment of WT OPVs delocalized F13L- and B5R-encoded proteins and blocked virus wrapping. Putative modelling of F13L and ST-246 revealed a probable pocket into which ST-246 penetrates. None of the identified amino acid changes occurred naturally among newly sequenced or NCBI-derived OPV F13L sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Besides demonstrating that F13L is a direct target of ST-246, we also identified novel F13L residues involved in the interaction with ST-246. These findings are important for ST-246 use in the clinic and crucial for future drug-resistance surveillance programmes.","Duraffour, Sophie; Lorenzo, María M.; Zöller, Gudrun; Topalis, Dimitri; Grosenbach, Doug; Hruby, Dennis E.; Andrei, Graciela; Blasco, Rafael; Meyer, Hermann; Snoeck, Robert",J Antimicrob Chemother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25630650/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dku545,697

Until May 19, 2020 more than 4 million and 700 thousand cases were oficially notified with about 316 thousand deaths. Etiological agent of the disease was identified as being a new coronavirus, Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). In this study we compared four different manual methods for RNA isolation and purification for detection of SARS-CoV-2 through qRT-PCR, as well as the extraction quality itself through detection of RNAse P. Magnetic beads-based (MagMax™) and silica column-based (Biopur®) methods presented the better performances. Concerning to the mean delay in CT values when compared to MagMax™, TRIzol™, Biopur® and EasyExtract presented 0,39, 0,95 and 5,23 respectively. Agreement between positive and negative results of different methods when compared with the one with better performance MagMax™ was 94,44% for silica column-based method (Biopur®), 88,89% for phenol-chroloform-based method (TRIzol™) and 77,78% for EasyExtract. We aimed to evaluate how reliable each method is for diagnostic purposes and to propose alternatives when usual methods are not available. In this regard, magnectic beads and silica column-based methods are convenient and reliable choices and phenol-chloroform-based method could also be chosen as an alternative.","Eisen, Ana Karolina Antunes; Demoliner, Meriane; Gularte, Juliana Schons; Hansen, Alana Witt; Schallenberger, Karoline; Mallmann, Larissa; Hermann, Bruna Saraiva; Heldt, Fágner Henrique; de Almeida, Paula Rodrigues; Fleck, Juliane Deise; Spilki, Fernando Rosado",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.29.122358,697

660140,Social Media: A Pandemic of Misinformation,2020-06-27,"COVID-19 vaccines are being developed urgently worldwide, among which single-shot adenovirus vectored vaccines represent a major approach. Here, we constructed two novel adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidates on simian adenovirus serotype 23 (Sad23L) and human adenovirus serotype 49 vectors (Ad49L) carrying the full-length gene of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), designated Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines, respectively. The immunogenicity elicited by these two vaccine strains was individually evaluated in mice. Specific humoral and cellular immune responses were proportionally observed in a dose-dependent manner, and stronger response was obtained by boosting. Furthermore, five rhesus macaques were intramuscularly injected with a dose of 5×109 PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine for prime vaccination, followed by boosting with 5×109 PFU of Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine at 4-week interval. Three macaques were injected with Sad23L-GFP and Ad49L-GFP vectorial viruses as negative controls. Both mice and macaques tolerated well the vaccine inoculations without detectable clinical or pathologic changes. In macaques, prime-boost vaccination regimen induced high titers of 103.16 S-binding antibody (S-BAb), 102.75 cell receptor binding domain (RBD)-BAb and 102.38 neutralizing antibody (NAb) to pseudovirus a week after boosting injection, followed by sustained high levels over 10 weeks of observation. Robust IFN-γ secreting T-cell response (712.6 SFCs/106 cells), IL-2 secreting T-cell response (334 SFCs/106 cells) and intracellular IFN-γ expressing CD4+/CD8+ T cell response (0.39%/0.55%) to S peptides were detected in the vaccinated macaques. It was concluded that prime-boost immunization with Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines can safely elicit strong immunity in animals in preparation of clinical phase 1/2 trials.","Luo, Shengxue; Zhang, Panli; Liu, Bochao; Yang, Chan; Liang, Chaolan; Wang, Qi; Zhang, Ling; Tang, Xi; Li, Jinfeng; Hou, Shuiping; Zeng, Jinfeng; Fu, Yongshui; Allain, Jean-Pierre; Li, Tingting; Zhang, Yuming; Li, Chengyao",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.28.311480,697

There are several biochemical markers linked with predicting the severity of coronavirus disease. This study aims to identify the most effective predictive biomarker such as C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), procalcitonin (PCT), and D-dimer, among others, in predicting the clinical outcome of the disease. Materials and methods This study was conducted as a retrospective, observational, multi-centric study, including all admitted COVID-19 positive patients only. The disease outcome was followed along with the hospital course of every patient at the time of analysis. Baseline laboratory investigations of all patients were monitored both at admission and discharge. A comparative analysis was done between the survivors (n=263) and non-survivors (n=101). Statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 25 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Results Of 364 patients, 65.7% were in the isolation ward, and 34.3% were in the intensive care unit; 72.3% of patients survived, while 27.7% of patients died. The mean age of the study population was 52.6 ± 15.8 years with female patients significantly younger than male patients (p=0.001) and 50 to 75 years being the most common age group (p=0.121). Among the survivors versus non-survivors of COVID-19, there were significant differences in total leukocyte count (p<0.001), neutrophil count, (p<0.001), lymphocyte count (p<0.001), urea (p<0.001), serum bicarbonate (p=0.001), CRP levels (p<0.001), LDH (p=0.013), and D-dimer (p<0.001) at admission. At discharge, the laboratory values of non-surviving patients showed significant leukocytosis (p<0.001), neutrophilia (p<0.001), lymphocytopenia (p<0.001), decreased monocytes (p<0.001), elevated urea and creatinine (p<0.001), hypernatremia (p<0.001), decreased serum bicarbonate levels (p<0.001), elevated CRP level (p=0.040), LDH (p<0.001), ferritin (p=0.001), and D-dimer (p<0.001). Among the recovered patients, the laboratory investigations at admission were significantly different from those at discharge like increased platelets (p=0.007), lower neutrophil count (p=0.001), higher lymphocyte count (p=0.005), an improved creatinine (p=0.020), higher sodium (p=0.008), increased bicarbonate levels (p<0.001), decreased CRP levels (p<0.001), and a lower LDH (p=0.039). However, the laboratory values of non-surviving patients had shown a lower hemoglobin (p=0.016), increased mean cell volume (p<0.001), significantly increased total leukocyte count (p<0.001), increased urea and creatinine (p<0.001), hypernatremia (p<0.001), increased bicarbonate (p=0.025), elevated D-dimer levels (p=0.043), and elevated PCT (p=0.021) on discharge. Receiver operating characteristic analysis concluded LDH (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.875), D-dimer (AUC: 0.803), and PCT (AUC: 0.769) were superior biomarkers to ferritin (AUC: 0.714) and CRP (AUC: 0.711) in predicting the fatality of COVID-19. Conclusion Inflammatory markers are a useful guide for predicting mortality, and the study results concluded that LDH, PCT, D-dimer, CRP, and ferritin were effective biomarkers.","Asghar, Muhammad Sohaib; Haider Kazmi, Syed J; Khan, Noman A; Akram, Mohammed; Hassan, Maira; Rasheed, Uzma; Ahmed Khan, Salman",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.9575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32913691/,697

Dans cette dernière éventualité interviennent des mécanismes épigénétiques. On rappellera d’abord différents types de modifications épigénétiques portant soit sur les histones de la chromatine, principalement des méthylations ou des acétylations ; soit sur l’ADN, par méthylation des cytosines. Des modifications de ce type suscitées par le tétrahydrocannabinol/THC du cannabis peuvent intervenir : soit au niveau des gamètes avant la procréation ; soit sur le fœtus pendant la gestation ; soit à différents moments de la vie de l’individu. À certaine de ces modifications épigénétiques est associé un accroissement de la vulnérabilité aux toxicomanies, impliquant les récepteurs D2 de la dopamine dans le noyau accumbens ; une surexpression de la synthèse du précurseur des enképhalines ; des modifications : des récepteurs CB1 des endocannabinoïdes ; des récepteurs de l’acide glutamique ; du GABA ; de protéines impliquées dans la plasticité synaptique, etc. Des modifications épigénétiques peuvent aussi affecter : le système immunitaire ; les activités cognitives ; le développement d’affections psychiatriques en relation avec des perturbations de la maturation cérébrale. Les connaissances qui s’accumulent à cet égard vont à l’opposé de la banalisation ambiante du cannabis. Elles imposent d’alerter les pouvoirs publics et le public, spécialement les jeunes, sur les risques associées à la consommation de cette drogue. Summary The almost pandemic spread of cannabis among adolescents and young adults, especially in France, justifies the attention given to the consequences, not only acute but also delayed, of this intoxication. In the latter case, epigenetic mechanisms occur. We will first recall various types of epigenetic modifications involving either chromatin histones, mainly methylations or acetylations; either DNA, by methylation of cytosines. Such modifications caused by the tetrahydrocannabinol/THC of cannabis can intervene: either at the level of gametes before procreation, or at different points of the life cycle. These epigenetic modifications are associated with an increase in vulnerability to drug addiction, involving dopamine D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens, overexpression of enkephalin precursor synthesis, modifications of: CB1 receptors of endocannabinoids, glutamic acid receptors, GABA receptors, proteins involved in synaptic plasticity ... These changes can also affect: immune system, cognitive activities, development of psychiatric diseases, related to disturbances of brain maturation. The knowledge that accumulates in this respect is the opposite of the ambient trivialization of this drug. They impose sending an alert to the public authorities and to the public, especially young people, warning on the risks associated with this drug use and abuse.","Costentin, J.",Bull Acad Natl Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001407920301758; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001407920301758?v=s5,697
664023,Effect of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Ambient Air Quality in Major Cities of Nepal,2021-03-02,"PURPOSE: Barriers to education in open and laparoscopic hernia repair technique include a steep learning curve and reduced theatre time for junior surgical trainees. This is particularly evident during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Simulation models may provide further opportunities for training in hernia repair outside of the traditional surgical apprenticeship model. METHODS: A systematic review was carried out following PRISMA guidelines to identify and evaluate simulation models in hernia repair. Of the 866 records screened, 27 were included in the analysis. These were assessed for face, content and construct validity, as well as their attempt to measure educational impact. RESULTS: Simulation models were identified comprising of animal tissues, synthetic materials and virtual reality (VR) technology. Models were designed for instruction in repair of inguinal, umbilical, incisional and diaphragmatic hernias. Twenty-one laparoscopic hernia repair models were described. Many models demonstrated validity across several domains, and three showed transferability of skills from simulation to the operating room. Of the six open hernia repair simulation models, none were found to have demonstrated an educational impact in addition to assessing validity. CONCLUSION: Few models individually were able to demonstrate validity and educational impact. Several novel assessment tools have been developed for assessment of progress when performing simulated and real laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. More study is required, particularly for open hernia repair, including randomized controlled trials with large sample sizes to assess the transferability of skills.","Pelly, T.; Vance-Daniel, J.; Linder, C.",Hernia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-021-02442-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34213680/,697
664056,Reclaiming the social from ‘social distancing’,2020-05-18,"Children are unique in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 has a lower medical impact in children as compared to adults. A higher proportion of children than adults remain asymptomatic following SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease and death are also less common. This relative resistance contrasts with the high susceptibility of children to other respiratory tract infections. The mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood but could include the rapid development of a robust innate immune response. On the other hand, children develop a unique and severe complication, named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, several weeks after the onset of symptoms. Although children play an important role in the transmission of many pathogens, their contribution to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appears lower than that of adults. These unique aspects of COVID-19 in children must be considered in the benefit–risk analysis of vaccination. Several COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for emergency use in adolescents and clinical studies are ongoing in children. As the vaccination of adolescents is rolled out in several countries, we shall learn about the impact of this strategy on the health of children and on transmission within communities.","Blanchard-Rohner, Geraldine; Didierlaurent, Arnaud; Tilmanne, Anne; Smeesters, Pierre; Marchant, Arnaud",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579240/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9091002,697
664672,Novel algorithm for accelerated electroanatomic mapping and prediction of earliest activation of focal cardiac arrhythmias using mathematical optimization,2017-06-11,"Most active non-LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons carry two open reading frames (ORFs) encoding ORF1p and ORF2p proteins. The ORF2p proteins are relatively well studied and are known to contain endonuclease/reverse transcriptase domains. At the same time, the biological function of ORF1p proteins remains poorly understood, except in that they nonspecifically bind single-stranded mRNA/DNA molecules. CR1-like elements form the most widely distributed clade/superfamily of non-LTR retrotransposons. We found that ORF1p proteins encoded by diverse CR1-like elements contain conserved esterase domain (ES) or plant homeodomain (PHD). This indicates that CR1-like ORF1p proteins are either lipolytic enzymes or are involved in protein-protein interactions related to chromatin remodeling. Sequence conservation of ES suggests that interaction with cellular membranes is an important phase in life circles of CR1-like elements. Presumably such interaction helps in penetrating host cells. As a consequence, the presence of multiple young CR1 families characterized by ∼10% intrafamily and 40% interfamily identities may be explained by a relatively frequent horizontal transfer of these CR1-like elements. Unexpectedly, ES links together non-LTR retrotransposons and single-stranded RNA viruses like influenza C and coronaviruses, which are known to depend on their own ES.","Kapitonov, Vladimir V.; Jurka, Jerzy",Mol Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12519904/,697

METHODS: A probability-based sample of 1,076 migrant and 1,195 local women were included in the study. A pre-tested field questionnaire was administered to participants through a direct face-to-face interview. Questionnaire contained questions on socio-demographic information, AIDS and STDs prevalence information and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) which measures objective support, subjective support, and utilization of social support. RESULTS: Compared to local women, married migrant women had lower levels of social support in most dimensions. Multi-variable analysis revealed that relationship with spouse, family average income, number of children, education, engagement and claimed reasons of moving have various correlations with one or all dimensions of social support scores. Higher social support is also related to awareness of infection status of HIV and STDs among this group.

666393,Pandemic and Future of Work: Rehabilitating Informal Workers Livelihoods Post Pandemic,2020-10-11,"BACKGROUND: Despite well-documented challenges in recruiting physicians to rural practice, few Canadian studies have described the role physician payment models may play in attracting and retaining physicians to rural practice. This study examined the perspectives of rural primary care physicians on the factors that attract and retain physicians in rural locations, including the role that alternative payment models (APMs) might play. METHODS: This was a qualitative study involving in-depth, open-ended interviews with rural primary care physicians practising under fee-for-service (FFS) models and APMs in Alberta, Canada. Participants were recruited from the Rural Health Professions Action Plan member list (consisting of physicians practising in rural or remote locations in Alberta) and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta online database. Interviews were conducted April to June 2020, and data were analyzed using a thematic framework approach. RESULTS: Fourteen physicians were interviewed. There were 5 themes identified: factors that attract physicians to rural practice, barriers and challenges associated with rural practice, the potential role of APMs in recruitment and retention, factors that physicians consider in deciding to change payment models, and physician perceptions of APMs compared with FFS models. Participants expressed that APMs may have some role to play in retaining rural physicians but identified professional challenges, and family-related and personal factors as key determinants. Most FFS physicians indicated that they were interested in exploring APMs provided specific concerns were addressed (e.g., clear and adequately compensated APM contracts, and physician involvement in the development of APMs). INTERPRETATION: Primary care physicians practising in rural regions in Alberta view payment models as one consideration among many in their decision to pursue rural practice. Alternative payment model contracts designed with the input of physicians may have a role to play in attracting and retaining physicians to rural practice.","Ogundeji, Yewande; Clement, Fiona; Wellstead, Darryn; Farkas, Brenlea; Manns, Braden",CMAJ Open,https://doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20200202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285058/,697

Mass vaccination strategies have been employed to reduce seasonal influenza outbreaks. We identified published economic models assessing influenza vaccination strategies to determine which key economic modeling components could be useful for future models in support of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Methods: Economic models published between January 2009 and June 2020 were identified by searching Medline (through National Library of Medicine’s PubMed) and GoogleScholar. The search strategy combined terminology for influenza vaccines with terminology for economic models (e.g., cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit, cost-consequence, decision trees, Markov). Results: 1,154 records were screened for inclusion;21 publications were included in the analysis. Sixteen identified models employed a Markov cohort or patient-level simulation approach, while 18 models incorporated quality-of-life and 13 incorporated a societal perspective;typical health states included uninfected, incubating, asymptomatic, symptomatic+isolated, symptomatic+circulating, partially immune, and dead. Common clinical outcomes included avoidance of virus cases, hospitalizations, and deaths;economic outcomes included cost savings associated with reduced hospitalizations, increased quality-of-life, and productivity gains. All but 1 model considered transmission rate, vaccination rate, vaccine efficacy, and rate of complications as key model drivers, whereas only 3 models considered vaccination plus broader public health strategies. Only 7 models incorporated herd immunity, citing uncertainty around availability and efficacy. While all models considered age and risk stratifications, no models assessed the implications of vaccination across different racial and ethnic groups. Conclusions: Future economic modeling in support of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine should incorporate the components of existing model frameworks for influenza vaccination strategies as well as account for differences specific to SAR-CoV-2 including broader public health strategies (e.g., face masks, social distancing) and racial disparities. Without these elements, future models may fail to accurately capture the potential benefits of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","Benner, J.; Adair, N.; Friedman, M.; Menzin, J.; Sussman, M.",Value in Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301520332502; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098301520332502; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.08.994,697

We implemented a surveillance study that minimizes response bias by recruiting adults to answer a survey without knowledge of later being offered SARS-CoV-2 test. Several methodologies were used to retrieve a population-representative sample. Participants (n = 2979) visited one of 11 drive-thru test sites from July 10th to August 16th, 2020 (or received an in-home visit) to provide a finger pin-prick sample. We applied a robust SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Microarray technology, which has superior measurement validity relative to FDA-approved tests. Participants include a broad age, gender, racial/ethnic, and income representation. Adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.5% (95% CI: 10.5–12.4%). Formal bias analyses produced similar results. Prevalence was elevated among Hispanics (vs. other non-Hispanic: prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.47, 95% CI 1.22–1.78) and household income < $50,000 (vs. > $100,000: PR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.79). Results from a diverse population using a highly specific and sensitive microarray indicate a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of ~ 12 percent. This population-based seroprevalence is seven-fold greater than that using official County statistics. In this region, SARS-CoV-2 also disproportionately affects Hispanic and low-income adults.","Bruckner, Tim A.; Parker, Daniel M.; Bartell, Scott M.; Vieira, Veronica M.; Khan, Saahir; Noymer, Andrew; Drum, Emily; Albala, Bruce; Zahn, Matthew; Boden-Albala, Bernadette",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82662-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33542329/,697
672603,Online Education in a Pandemic: Stress Test or Fortuitous Disruption?,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND: Dentin hypersensitivity (DH) is a sharp toothache that influences a patients' oral health-related quality of life. Oral dentifrices have been marketed for pain relief within a minute for DH. The permanent management of DH is being investigated with the remineralisation potential of bioactive agents in dentinal tubules. This study investigated the relief from pain in DH in one minute after applying over the counter (OTC) dentifrices with Pro-Argin™ and strontium acetate and directly compared them with fluoro-calcium phospho-silicate (FCPS)-based dentifrices for immediate and sustained inhibition of painful stimulus provoking DH. METHODS: A randomised, controlled, triple-blinded clinical trial was conducted with 140 participants clinically diagnosed with DH and equally randomized into four groups with parallel treatment assignment of FCPS, Pro-Argin™, 8% strontium acetate, and sodium fluoride-based OTC dentifrices, and tested for DH with air blast, mechanical, and water jet stimuli on SCHIFF cold air sensitivity scale (SCASS) and visual analogue scale (VAS) at interim efficacy intervals of one minute, three days, two, four, and six weeks, subsequently. RESULTS: A total of 128 participants completed the trial. All the treatment groups showed statistically significant improvement in DH with p < 0.001 relative to baseline at all time points. Pro-Argin™ showed a greater reduction in DH with mean scores of (1.34 ± 0.68) (4.20 ± 1.70) (3.05 ± 2.17) followed by strontium acetate (1.57 ± 0.81) (4.65 ± 1.87) (3.75 ± 1.97) on SCASS and VAS for mechanical and water jet stimuli, one minute after application. There was no statistically significant treatment difference between the two (p = 0.499). FCPS showed the highest reduction in DH on SCASS and VAS for waterjet stimuli with mean scores of (0.97 ± 0.68) (1.80 ± 1.73) and Pro-Argin™ on VAS for mechanical stimuli with mean scores of (2.15 ± 1.92) in six weeks. CONCLUSION: OTC dentifrices with Pro-argin™ and strontium acetate are effective for immediate pain relief from DH, and FCPS could be the best possible treatment option for long term management of DH.

673676,Managing the COVID-19 emergency: A coordination framework to enhance response practices and actions,2021-02-01,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has major effects on the clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes among patients, producing severe symptoms and death. Smoking has been reported as one of the factors that increases severity and mortality rate among COVID-19 patients. However, the effect of smoking on such medical outcomes is still controversial. This study conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis (SR/MA) on the association between smoking and negative outcomes among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Google Scholar, were systematically searched from the initiation of the database until 12 December 2020. All relevant studies about smoking and COVID-19 were screened using a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale was used to assess the methodological quality of eligible articles. Random meta-analyses were conducted to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs). Publication bias was assessed using the funnel plot, Begg’s test and Egger’s test. RESULTS: A total of 1248 studies were retrieved and reviewed. A total of 40 studies were finally included for meta-analysis. Both current smoking and former smoking significantly increase the risk of disease severity (OR=1.58; 95% CI: 1.16–2.15, p=0.004; and OR=2.48; 95% CI: 1.64–3.77, p<0.001; respectively) with moderate appearance of heterogeneity. Similarly, current smoking and former smoking also significantly increase the risk of death (OR=1.35; 95% CI: 1.12–1.62, p=0.002; and OR=2.58; 95% CI: 2.15–3.09, p<0.001; respectively) with moderate appearance of heterogeneity. There was no evidence of publication bias, which was tested by the funnel plot, Begg’s test and Egger’s test. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking, even current smoking or former smoking, significantly increases the risk of COVID-19 severity and death. Further causational studies on this association and ascertianing the underlying mechanisms of this relation is warranted.","Umnuaypornlert, Adinat; Kanchanasurakit, Sukrit; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo III; Saokaew, Surasak",Tob Induc Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33551713/; https://doi.org/10.18332/tid/132411,697

SETTING: An 800-bed tertiary-level teaching hospital in the south of Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: Serum was collected for anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG using the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG CMIA qualitative assay, as per the manufacturer’s specifications. The groups were as follows: (1) HCWs who had real-time PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 infection (>1-month postpositive RT-PCR); (2) HCWs identified as close contacts of persons with COVID-19 infection and who subsequently developed symptoms (virus not detected by RT-PCR on oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swab); (3) HCWs identified as close contacts of COVID-19 cases and who remained asymptomatic (not screened by RT-PCR); (4) HCWs not included in the aforementioned groups working in areas determined as high-risk clinical areas; and (5) HCWs not included in the aforementioned groups working in areas determined as low-risk clinical areas. RESULTS: Six of 404 (1.49%) HCWs not previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection (groups 2–5) were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of recruitment into the study. Out of the 99 participants in group 1, 72 had detectable IgG to SARS-CoV-2 on laboratory testing (73%). Antibody positivity correlated with shorter length of time between RT-PCR positivity and antibody testing. Quantification cycle value on RT-PCR was not found to be correlated with antibody positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs who had not previously tested RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 was low compared with similar studies.","Faller, Eamonn; Wyse, Adrianne; Barry, Rachel; Conlon, Kevin; Everard, Cormac; Finnegan, Paula; Foran, Claire; Herlihy, Emer; Kerr, Gerry; Lapthorne, Susan; McGreal-Bellone, Aimee; Morrissey, Edmond; O’Sullivan, Deirdre; O’Sullivan, Grainne; Eustace, Joseph A; Spillane, Declan; Dempsey, Catherine; Benson, John; Prentice, Mike; Gallagher, John; MacSharry, John; Fanning, Liam J; O’Riordan, Stephen; Horgan, Mary; Sadlier, Corinna",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34103324/,697

However, it is unknown what impact they could have on the evolution of patients, particularly critically ill patients. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics and impact of ICU-acquired infections in patients with COVID-19. A retrospective cohort study was conducted, evaluating all patients with critical COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital in Southern Peru from 28 March 2020 to 1 March 2021. Of the 124 patients evaluated, 50 (40.32%) developed a healthcare-associated infection (HAI), which occurred at a median of 8 days (IQR 6–17) after ICU admission. The proportion of patients with HAI that required ceftriaxone was significantly higher; the same was true for the use of dexamethasone. Forty bacteria isolations (80%) were classified as XDR to antibiotics, with the most common organisms being Acinetobacter baumannii (54%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%); 33% (41/124) died at the ICU during the follow-up. In the adjusted analysis, healthcare-associated infection was associated with an increased risk of mortality (aHR= 2.7; 95% CI: 1.33–5.60) and of developing acute renal failure (aRR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.42–6.72). The incidence of healthcare infection mainly by XDR pathogens is high in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and is associated with an increased risk of complications or death.","Copaja-Corzo, Cesar; Hueda-Zavaleta, Miguel; Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J.",Antibiotics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10080959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439009/,697

Even with few language and cultural barriers, however, many Latino immigrants in Puerto Rico are uninsured. Using data from the 2014-19 Puerto Rico Community Survey, we examined inequities in health insurance coverage for non-Puerto Rican Latinos ages 18-64 living in Puerto Rico according to citizenship status and Latino subgroup (Dominican, Cuban, Mexican, and other Latino). After controlling for potential confounders, we found that noncitizen Dominicans had a significantly lower probability of having any health insurance (57.2 percent) and having any private insurance (31.5 percent). Regardless of similarities in culture and language, Latino immigrants on the island, particularly Dominicans, experience major health insurance coverage inequities. Considering that Puerto Rico's immigration system is regulated by US federal statute, both federal and local policy makers should acknowledge and focus on reducing these immigrant disparities in health insurance coverage.","Rivera-González, Alexandra C; Stimpson, Jim P; Roby, Dylan H; Canino, Glorisa; Purtle, Jonathan; Bellamy, Scarlett L; Ortega, Alexander N",Health Aff (Millwood),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34228518/; https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.00049,697
675491,Measuring Place Connectivity Using Big Social Media Data,2021-02-08,"Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). At the time of conducting this study, it had recorded over 11,301,850 confirmed cases while more than 531,806 have died due to it, with these figures rising daily across the globe. The burden of this highly contagious respiratory disease is that it presents itself in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patterns in those already infected, thereby leading to an exponential rise in the number of contractions of the disease and fatalities. It is, therefore, crucial to expedite the process of early detection and diagnosis of the disease across the world. The case-based reasoning (CBR) model is a compelling paradigm that allows for the utilization of case-specific knowledge previously experienced, concrete problem situations or specific patient cases for solving new cases. This study, therefore, aims to leverage the very rich database of cases of COVID-19 to solve new cases. The approach adopted in this study employs the use of an improved CBR model for state-of-the-art reasoning task in the classification of suspected cases of COVID-19. The CBR model leverages on a novel feature selection and the semantic-based mathematical model proposed in this study for case similarity computation. An initial population of the archive was achieved from 71 (67 adults and 4 pediatrics) cases obtained from the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM) repository. Results obtained revealed that the proposed approach in this study successfully classified suspected cases into their categories with an accuracy of 94.54%. The study found that the proposed model can support physicians to easily diagnose suspected cases of COVID-19 based on their medical records without subjecting the specimen to laboratory tests. As a result, there will be a global minimization of contagion rate occasioned by slow testing and in addition, reduced false-positive rates of diagnosed cases as observed in some parts of the globe.","Oyelade, Olaide N.; Ezugwu, Absalom E.",Inform Med Unlocked,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352914820303683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835080/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914820303683?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2020.100395,697

We conducted a single center prospective study to identify the clinical and immunological features associated with vaccine-induced antibody response in 53 participants before and after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. This is the first report on the anti-spike RBD and anti-nucleocapsid antibody response, along with pre- and post-vaccine absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) and flow cytometry analysis of CD19 and CD20 lymphocytes in patients with MS and NMO. We tested the hypothesis that patients on BCDT may have impaired COVID-19 vaccine humoral responses. Among patients on BCDT, 36.4% demonstrated a positive antibody response to spike RBD, in comparison to 100% in all other groups such as healthy controls, untreated MS, and patients on non-B cell depleting DMTs (p < 0.0001). Immunological data revealed lower baseline (pre-vaccination) levels of IgM in patients on BCDT (p = 0.003). Low CD19 and CD20 counts and a shorter interval from the last B cell depleting therapy infusion to the first vaccine dose were associated with a negative spike RBD antibody response (non-seroconverter) in patients on BCDT.

This cross-sectional study was performed with health professionals from various public and private hospitals in Rio Verde, Goiás, Brazil. Daytime sleepiness and sleep quality were assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. The variables were analyzed using multiple hierarchical Poisson regression in the statistical package Stata version 13.0. A total of 244 health professionals participated in this study (women, 78.28%). The rates of abnormal daytime sleepiness and poor sleep quality were 50.41% (n = 123) and 55.74% (n = 136), respectively. Reduced physical activity was associated with poor sleep quality (prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02–1.70, p = 0.035).

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eighteen male calves 8–30 days of age were used to evaluate the efficacy of 3 methods of fluid therapy after induction of osmotic diarrhea and dehydration. The diarrhea and dehydration were induced by administration of saccharose, spironolactone, and hydrochlorothiazide for 48 hours. The animals were randomly divided into 3 experimental groups: Group 1: 7.2% hypertonic saline solution‐HSS (5 mL/kg IV); Group 2: oral isotonic electrolyte solution IES (60 mL/kg PO); or Group 3: HSS+IES. Clinical signs and laboratory finding observed 48 hours post‐induction (Time 0) included diarrhea, dehydration, lethargy, and metabolic acidosis. RESULTS: Calves treated with HSS + IES experienced decreases in hematocrit, total protein concentration, albumin concentration, urea nitrogen concentration, and plasma volume as well as increases in blood pH, blood bicarbonate concentration, and central venous pressure between 1 and 3 hours post‐treatment. These findings also were observed in animals treated with IES, however, at a slower rate than in the HSS + IES‐treated animals.

To contain this highly contagious and potentially deadly disease, the French government decided an unprecedented nationwide lockdown. We investigated in a large cohort of cancer patients from Hauts-de-France, the third French region most stricken by COVID-19, the frequency of symptoms, how cancer navigated the health care system during these very difficult circumstances, and their feelings. Method(s): We made a flash survey among 6900 patients treated at our cancer center within March 2019 and March 2020. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short web-based survey sent on April 30 and closed on May 14. Result(s): We received reports from 2224 cancer patients. Mean age was 63 years, 72% were women, only 9% were smokers, 26% had hypertension, 9% diabetes, and 5% asthma. The most represented cancers were breast (45%), gynecologic cancers (12%), digestive (8%), and head and neck cancer (6%). Most patients were in follow up, 13% were receiving chemotherapy. The majority did not develop symptoms associated with COVID during the COVID wave;one third experienced symptoms. The main symptoms reported were headache (38%), myalgia and arthralgia (31%), cough (25%), digestive signs (20%), intense fatigue (19%), or fever (13%). Among patients with symptoms, 58% did not seek medical advice during the COVID wave and 95% of them were not tested. For those receiving chemotherapy, 80% had their treatment as planned. Among patients with a planned surgery, 30% of them were delayed. 32% of the patients reported anxiety, 35% felt unsecure and 16% reported an increased consumption of antistress medication, tobacco or alcohol. We also discuss the pattern of symptoms and feelings according to the cancer type and the treatment received. Conclusion(s): This study showed that most of our cancer patients were probably not infected during the COVID wave, which highlights the need to maintain barrier measures to protect them and perform validated tests. An appropriate supportive care is also necessary to manage patients' distress due to COVID 19 in many of them. Legal entity responsible for the study: Centre Oscar Lambret.

RESULTS: We included 2,503 women admitted to the hospital; 1,287 (51.4 %) were admitted before the Covid-19 lockdown and 1,216 (48.6 %) during the Covid-19 lockdown. There were no significant differences in stillbirth rates (p = 0.584) or pregnancy complications (including preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes) (p = 0.115) between pregnant women in the pre- and intra-pandemic periods. However, decreases in preterm births (p = 0.001), and low birth weight (p = 0.005) were observed in the pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic period. No significant difference in the mode of delivery, and no maternal deaths were observed during the two time periods. CONCLUSIONS: In our study we observed a decrease in preterm births and low birth weight, no change in stillbirths, and a rise in the admission rates of mothers to the ICU during the initial Covid-19 lockdown period compared to pre-Covid-19 lockdown period. Further research will be needed to devise plan for immediate post-pandemic care and future health care crises.","Ranjbar, Fahimeh; Allahqoli, Leila; Ahmadi, Soheila; Mousavi, Robab; Gharacheh, Maryam; Eshraghi, Nooshin; Alkatout, Ibrahim",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-04050-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34420514/,697

We found that there is a structure similarity between S1 protein and influenza virus neuraminidase. Our analyses suggest that the existing anti-influenza virus inhibitors and anti-neuraminidase antibody could be used as a starting point for designing anti-SARS drugs, vaccines and antibodies.

However, the mechanism through which SSc acts against HBV remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of SSc mediated anti-HBV activity. METHODS: HepG2.2.15 cells were cultured at 37 ℃ in the presence of 1–40 μg/mL of SSc or DMSO as a control. The expression profile of HBV markers, cytokines, HNF1α and HNF4α were investigated by real-time quantitative PCR, Elisa, Western blot and Dot blotting. Knockdown of HNF1α or HNF4α in HepG2.2.15 cells was mediated by two small siRNAs specifically targeting HNF1α or HNF4α. RESULTS: We found that SSc stimulates IL-6 expression, leading to attenuated HNF1α and HNF4α expression, which further mediates suppression of HBV pgRNA synthesis. Knockdown of HNF1α or HNF4α in HepG2.2.15 cells by RNA interference abrogates SSc’s anti-HBV role. Moreover, SSc is effective to both wild-type and drug-resistant HBV mutants. CONCLUSION: SSc inhibits pgRNA synthesis by targeting HNF1α and HNF4α. These results indicate that SSc acts as a promising compound for modulating pgRNA transcription in the therapeutic strategies against HBV infection.

However, it is not yet understood if SARS-CoV-2 can infect the eye and if the ocular surface can be a potential route of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions. Our review focuses on the viral entry mechanisms to give a better understanding of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the eye. We highlighted findings that give evidence for multiple potential receptors of SARS-CoV-2 on the ocular surface. Additionally, we focused on data concerning the detection of viral RNA and its spike protein in the various ocular tissues from patients. However, the expression level seemed to be relatively low compared to the respiratory tissues as a result of a unique environment surrounding the ocular surface and the innate immune response of SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, our review suggests the ocular surface as a potential route for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and as a result of this study we strongly recommend the protection of the eyes for ophthalmologists and patients at risk.","Kitazawa, Koji; Deinhardt-Emmer, Stefanie; Inomata, Takenori; Deshpande, Sharvari; Sotozono, Chie",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10040796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33918318/,697

METHODS: We cross-sectionally studied 109 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in non-critical status. Clinical data (age, sex, comorbidities, and medications) and body mass index (BMI) were assessed. Laboratory tests included serum hemoglobin, leukocytes, lymphocytes, platelets, C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer, and creatinine. Physical status was evaluated using a handgrip dynamometer. Endothelial function was assessed non-invasively using flow-mediated dilation (FMD) method. RESULTS: The sample average age was 51 years, 51% were male, and the most frequent comorbidity was obesity (62%). Univariate analysis showed association of lower FMD with higher BMI, hypertension, use of oral antihypertensive, higher blood levels of creatinine, and larger baseline artery diameter. After adjusting for confounders, the multivariate analysis showed BMI (95% CI -0.26, -0.11; P < 0.001) as the major factor associated with FMD. Other factors associated with FMD were baseline artery diameter (95% CI -1.77, -0.29; P = 0.007) and blood levels of creatinine (95% CI -1.99, -0.16; P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Increased BMI was the major factor associated with endothelial dysfunction in non-critically hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Many developing countries have high mortality rates due to pneumonia because of the unavailability of proper and timely diagnostic measures. Using machine learning-based diagnosis methods can help to detect the disease early and in less time and cost. In this study, we proposed a novel method to determine the presence of pneumonia and identify its type (bacterial or viral) through analyzing chest radiographs. We performed a three-class classification based on features containing diverse information of the samples. After using an augmentation technique to balance the dataset's sample sizes, we extracted the chest X-ray images' statistical features, as well as global features by employing a deep learning architecture. We then combined both sets of features and performed the final classification using the RandomForest classifier. A feature selection method was also incorporated to identify the features with the highest relevance. We tested the proposed method on a widely used (but relabeled) chest radiograph dataset to evaluate its performance. The proposed model can classify the dataset's samples with an 86.30% classification accuracy and 86.03% F-score, which assert the model's efficacy and reliability. However, results show that the classifier struggles while distinguishing between viral and bacterial pneumonia samples. Implementing this method will provide a fast and automatic way to detect pneumonia in a patient and identify its type.","Masud, Mehedi; Bairagi, Anupam Kumar; Nahid, Abdullah-Al; Sikder, Niloy; Rubaiee, Saeed; Ahmed, Anas; Anand, Divya",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33728035/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8862089,697

The selected countries were divided into two groups: Group A (China, Switzerland, and Ireland) and Group B (USA, Brazil, and India) based on their outbreak containment of this virus. Then, the actual data for each country were fitted to a regression model utilizing the excel solver software to assess the current and future trajectory of novel COVID-19 and its impact. In addition, the data were fitted using the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) Model. The Group A trajectory showed an “S” shape trend that suited a logistic function with r(2) > 0.97, which is an indication of the outbreak control. The SIR models for the countries in this group showed that they passed the expected 99% end of pandemic dates. Group B, however, exhibited a continuous increase of the total COVID-19 new cases, that best suited an exponential growth model with r(2) > 0.97, which meant that the outbreak is still uncontrolled. The SIR models for the countries in this group showed that they are still relatively far away from reaching the expected 97% end of pandemic dates. The maximum death percentage varied from 3.3% (India) to 7.2% with USA recording the highest death percentage, which is virtually equal to the maximum death percentage of the world (7.3%). The power of the exponential model determines the severity of the country’s trajectory that ranged from 11 to 19 with the USA and Brazil having the highest values. The maximum impact of this COVID-19 pandemic occurred during the uncontrolled stage (2), which mainly depended on the deceptive stage (1). Further, some novel potential containment strategies are discussed. Results from both models showed that the Group A countries contained the outbreak, whereas the Group B countries still have not reached this stage yet.

687943,Toward the Impact of Non-pharmaceutical Interventions and Vaccination on the COVID-19 Pandemic With Time-Dependent SEIR Model,2021-03-18,"Background Shielding (extended self-isolation) of people judged, a priori, to be at high-risk from COVID-19 has been used by some countries to protect the individuals and reduce demand on health services. It is unclear how well this strategy works in either regard. Methods A general population study was conducted using linked primary care, prescribing, laboratory, hospital and death records up to end of May 2020. Poisson regression models and population attributable fractions were used to compare COVID-19 outcomes by overall risk category, and individual risk criteria: confirmed infection, hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, population mortality and case-fatality. Results Of the 1.3 million population, 32,533 (2.47%) had been advised to shield, a further 347,374 (26.41%) were classified as moderate risk. Testing for COVID-19 was more common in the shielded (6.75%) and moderate (1.99%) than low (0.72%) risk categories. Referent to low-risk, the shielded group had higher risk of confirmed infection (RR 7.91, 95% 7.01-8.92), case-fatality (RR 5.19, 95% CI 4.12-6.53) and population mortality (RR 48.64, 95% 37.23-63.56). The moderate risk had intermediate risk of confirmed infection (RR 4.11, 95% CI 3.82-4.42) and population mortality (RR 26.10, 95% CI 20.89-32.60), but had comparable case-fatality (RR 5.13, 95% CI 4.24-6.21) to the shielded, and accounted for a higher proportion of deaths (PAF 75.27% vs 13.38%). Age [≥]70 years made the largest contribution to deaths (49.53%) and was associated with an 8-fold risk of infection, 7-fold case-fatality and 74-fold mortality. Conclusions Shielding has not been effective at preventing deaths in those with highest risk. To be effective as a population strategy, shielding criteria would need to be widely expanded to include other criteria, such as the elderly.","Jani, B. D.; Ho, F. K.; Lowe, D.

However, these technologies are only effective if the public is willing to use them, implying that their perceived public health benefits must outweigh personal concerns over privacy and security. The Australian federal government recently launched the ‘COVIDSafe’ app, designed to anonymously register nearby contacts. If a contact later identifies as infected with COVID-19, health department officials can rapidly followup with their registered contacts to stop the virus’ spread. The current study assessed attitudes towards three tracking technologies (telecommunication network tracking, a government app, and Apple and Google’s Bluetooth exposure notification system) in two representative samples of the Australian public prior to the launch of COVIDSafe. We compared these attitudes to usage of the COVIDSafe app after its launch in a further two representative samples of the Australian public. Using Bayesian methods, we find widespread acceptance for all tracking technologies, however, observe a large intention-behaviour gap between people’s stated attitudes and actual uptake of the COVIDSafe app. We consider the policy implications of these results for Australia and the world at large.","Garrett, Paul M.; White, Joshua P.; Lewandowsky, Stephan; Kashima, Yoshihisa; Perfors, Andrew; Little, Daniel R.; Geard, Nic; Mitchell, Lewis; Tomko, Martin; Dennis, Simon",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33481841/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244827,697

TRIAL DESIGN: This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-arm clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: The study participants will be recruited from patients admitted to the ICU of Al-Zahra hospital with a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19. The inclusion criteria are aged between 20 and 75 years, confirmation of COVID-19 based on the PCR test, and admitted to the ICU. The exclusion criteria include the present use of parenteral nutrition support, a history of underlying diseases such as congenital disorders, immune diseases, renal and hepatic insufficiency, and pancreatitis, a history of sensitivity to herbal remedies such as turmeric and pepper, and regular use of anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin. This study will be performed in the Al-Zahra hospital, an academic hospital affiliated with Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Sixty eligible patients will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive curcumin-piperine capsules (three capsules/day; each capsules containing 500 mg curcumin plus 5 mg piperine; in total 1500 mg curcumin and 15 mg piperine/daily) for seven days (n=30) or matching placebo capsules (three capsules/day; each capsules containing 505 mg maltodextrin; totally 1515 mg, maltodextrin/ daily) for same duration (n=30). Capsules will be administered after oral or enteral feeding at 9, 15 and 21 o’clock. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the time from initiation of supplementation (curcumin-piperine or placebo) to normalization of fever, respiratory rate, and blood oxygen saturation. The secondary outcomes are the mortality rate, length of stay in ICU, temperature, levels of blood oxygen saturation, ventilator dependency, respiratory rate, levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), levels of liver markers (ALT, AST, LDH), and levels of kidney function markers (BUN, Creatinine). FOLLOW UP: All of the parameters will be assessed at baseline and end of the study (7 days intervention). In addition, the rate of mortality will be collected after 4 weeks (28 days’ mortality in the ICU, 4 weeks follow up). RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group (Curcumin-piperine) or the control group (Placebo). Randomization sequences will be generated using an electronic table of random numbers to allocate the included participants into either control or intervention groups (in a 1:1 ratio) using the stratified block randomization method. Stratification was conducted according to sex (male and female), with a block size of four. The allocation sequences will be prepared by an independent statistician and will be kept inside sealed, opaque, and consecutively numbered envelopes. Participants, investigators, nurses, and physicians will be unaware of the trial-group assignment. BLINDING (MASKING): This study is a double-blind clinical trial (participants, investigators, nurses, and physicians). The curcumin-piperine and placebo supplements will be similar in the terms of texture, taste, color, odor, and weight. Both tablets will be provided in containers that are completely identical in weight, shape, labeling, and packaging. All participants, investigators, nurses, and physicians will be unaware of the trial-group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The sample size is estimated at 60 participants, including 30 patients in the intervention group and 30 patients in the placebo group.

The current screening protocols emphasize concurrent use of both SD-OCT and Visual field analysis (VFA) which detects functional damage to detect Hydroxychloroquine maculopathy. However, VFA is a time-consuming and subjective test which is often neglected. This study gives the prevalence of Hydroxychloroquine maculopathy using SD-OCT alone which often fails to detect macular damage in peri-foveal and extra-foveal area of the retina. METHODS: Three hundred thirty four eyes of 167 patients taking systemic Hydroxychloroquine were studied with SD-OCT macular cube 512 x 128 to diagnose structural macular damage to detect prevalence of Hydroxychloroquine maculopathy. RESULTS: Out of 167 patients, only four patients showed features suggestive of Hydroxychloroquine maculopathy. One patient had ELM loss, two had para-foveal and one had peri-foveal IS-OS disruption. The SD-OCT gave prevalence as 2.4%. CONCLUSION: SD-OCT alone can underdiagnose burden of Hydroxychloroquine maculopathy (prevalence = 2.4%) when compared to studies which use both SD-OCT and Visual field analysis (prevalence = 7.5%).","Pandey, Shikha; Kumar, Poninder; Moulick, P.S.; Vats, Sumedha",Med J Armed Forces India,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.04.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377123720300733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836708/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377123720300733,697
