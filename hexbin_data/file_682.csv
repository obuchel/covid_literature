32390,Hygienemaßnahmen: BVDD fordert Pauschale von der PKV,2020-05-20,"We propose a new generative model for topic segmentation based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The task is to divide a document into a sequence of topically coherent segments, while preserving long topic change-points (coherency) and keeping short topic segments from getting merged (saliency). Most of the existing models either fuse topic segments by keywords or focus on modeling word co-occurrence patterns without merging. They can hardly achieve both coherency and saliency since many words have high uncertainties in topic assignments due to their polysemous nature. To solve this problem, we introduce topic-specific co-occurrence of word pairs within contexts in modeling, to generate more coherent segments and alleviate the influence of irrelevant words on topic assignment. We also design an optimization algorithm to eliminate redundant items in the generated topic segments. Experimental results show that our proposal produces significant improvements in both topic coherence and topic segmentation.","Li, Wenbo; Matsukawa, Tetsu; Saigo, Hiroto; Suzuki, Einoshin",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206242/,682
71412,"Electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing system vs. harmonic scalpel in colorectal laparoscopic surgery: a prospective, randomized study.",2009,"To convert and store energy in the process of photosynthesis, plants primarily use quanta of the red and blue parts of the spectrum. At high latitudes, the average daily intensity of red and blue parts of the spectrum is not very high; for many crops cultivated under greenhouse conditions, it reaches the sufficient level only on clear summer days. The problem of insufficient illumination in greenhouses is usually solved with artificial light sources. This article describes a technology for the manufacture of photoconversion fluoropolymer films for greenhouses. The fluoropolymer films described in the paper make use of original gold nanoparticles and nanoparticles with fluorescence in the blue or red region of the spectrum. In the polymer film, nanoparticles aggregate in the form of ""beads"", which enhances the field of the optical wave. The film photoconverts UV and violet light into blue and red light. Gold nanoparticles also partially convert energy in the green region of the spectrum (not used by plants) into heat, which is also important for agriculture at high latitudes. In addition, impregnation of gold nanoparticles into fluoropolymer significantly increases the lifetime of the film. The films described in the paper can significantly increase the productivity of greenhouses located at high latitudes. Plants cultivated under the films have more chlorophyll and a higher intensity of photosynthesis - although their system of distance stress signals is, to a certain degree, suppressed.","Gudkov, Sergey V; Simakin, Alexander V; Bunkin, Nikolay F; Shafeev, Georgy A; Astashev, Maxim E; Glinushkin, Alexey P; Grinberg, Marina A; Vodeneev, Vladimir A","Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

85976,Overcoming spectrum bias for accurate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimates.,2021-04-12,"Sedation for medical procedures is provided in a variety of clinical settings by medical personnel with differing levels of education and training. Although generally a safe practice, there is a degree of morbidity and mortality associated with sedation practice. Monitoring standards continue to be refined by professional societies with the goal of improving care. The depth of sedation should be monitored with clinical criteria. Processed electroencephalographic monitors currently do not contribute significantly to sedation care. Monitoring ventilation using pulse oximetry should be abandoned for more direct methods, such as capnography-transcutaneous carbon dioxide, respiratory acoustical and thoracic impedance monitoring could also play a role. Propofol has become widely utilized for sedation, although there are concerns about its margin of safety and synergistic interactions with other agents. Dexmedetomidine and propofol/ketamine also have utility. Patient-controlled sedation pumps and target-controlled infusion devices have been developed to improve patient care and satisfaction. A computer-assisted propofol sedation device to be used by non-anaesthesiologists has been approved in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration. More computer-assisted sedation delivery devices are likely to be developed, but their clinical utility is unclear.","Sheahan, C G; Mathews, D M",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aeu378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25498581/,682
96035,Performance of a Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Detection Assay in Symptomatic Children.,2021-05-26,"Oily sludge is widely produced in the processes of petroleum exploitation, storage, transportation, and refining, and becomes more stable during aging. The interfacial stability of aging oily sludge hinders the recovery and disposal of oil resources. This review summarizes the interfacial film stability of aging oily sludge, which occurs through the formation of viscoelastic and rigid bilayer interfacial films between heavy components (asphaltenes and resins) and inorganic particles. The bilayer interfacial films enhance interfacial film strength and hinder the aggregation of droplets, contributing to the formation of a stable and high-viscosity oil-water-solid three-phase mixture. Recent demulsification technologies for reducing the stability of interfacial films have been classified as follows: removing heavy components, changing asphaltene aggregate structure, and reducing inorganic particle content. More efficient demulsification technologies are expected to be developed by deeply analyzing the microstructure and interfacial properties of asphaltenes and resins, as well as comprehensively studying the complex interactions among various components. This review constructs a bridge between the stability mechanism and the corresponding destabilization methods, which would promote future studies in aging oily sludge treatment.","Liu, Jia; Zhang, Yixuan; Peng, Kaiming; Zhao, Xia; Xiong, Yuan; Huang, Xiangfeng",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.125624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740725/,682

However, recommendations for conducting pathology-based observational studies are not readily available. In part 1 of this series, we offer advice on planning and conducting an observational study with examples from the veterinary pathology literature. Investigators should recognize the importance of creativity, insight, and innovation in devising studies that solve problems and fill important gaps in knowledge. Studies should focus on specific and testable hypotheses, questions, or objectives. The methodology is developed to support these goals. We consider the merits and limitations of different types of analytic and descriptive studies, as well as of prospective vs retrospective enrollment. Investigators should define clear inclusion and exclusion criteria and select adequate numbers of study subjects, including careful selection of the most appropriate controls. Studies of causality must consider the temporal relationships between variables and the advantages of measuring incident cases rather than prevalent cases. Investigators must consider unique aspects of studies based on archived laboratory case material and take particular care to consider and mitigate the potential for selection bias and information bias. We close by discussing approaches to adding value and impact to observational studies.

164591,Analytical performances of the COVISTIX and Panbio antigen rapid tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection in an unselected population (all commers),2021-09-14,"Abstract: Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an escalating global epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, with a high mortality in critical patients. Effective indicators for predicting disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are urgently needed. Methods: In this study, 43 COVID-19 patients admitted in Chongqing Public Health Medical Center were involved. Demographic data, clinical features, and laboratory examinations were obtained through electronic medical records. Peripheral blood specimens were collected from COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets and cytokine profiles by flow cytometry. Potential contributing factors for prediction of disease severity were further analyzed. Results: A total of 43 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, including 29 mild patients and 14 sever patients. Severe patients were significantly older (61.9+/-9.4 vs 44.4+/-15.9) and had higher incidence in co-infection with bacteria compared to mild group (85.7%vs27.6%). Significantly more severe patients had the clinical symptoms of anhelation (78.6%) and asthma (71.4%). For laboratory examination, 57.1% severe cases showed significant reduction in lymphocyte count. The levels of Interluekin-6 (IL6), IL10, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and D-Dimer (D-D) were significantly higher in severe patients than mild patients, while the level of albumin (ALB) was remarkably lower in severe patients. Further analysis demonstrated that ESR, D-D, age, ALB and IL6 were the major contributing factors for distinguishing severe patients from mild patients. Moreover, ESR was identified as the most powerful factor to predict disease progression of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Age and the levels of ESR, D-D, ALB and IL6 are closely related to the disease severity of COVID-19 patients. ESR can be used as a valuable indicator for distinguishing severe COVID-19 patients in early stage, so as to increase the survival of severe patients.

Our goal was to cover basic coding topics and data science concepts through live coding and hands-on practice. However, we could not find a resource that exactly met our needs. Therefore, over the past three years, we have developed a curriculum and instructional format using Jupyter notebooks to effectively teach introductory Python for data science. This method, inspired by The Carpentries organization, uses bite-sized lessons followed by independent practice time to reinforce coding concepts, and culminates in a data science capstone project using real-world data.

Given the abruptness of epidemic outbreaks, quick access to sufficient medical supplies is essential. Most existing research focuses on reserving physical stocks only, while some authors also consider reserving production capacity. This study is the first to consider capital reserves besides physical stocks, a practice that is for instance used in China. We characterize in closed form and graphically under what conditions a certain reserve policy (no reserves, safety stock only, capital reserve only, mixed reserves) is optimal. A key insight is that increased demand uncertainty sometimes leads to lower safety stock levels, although the combined reserves do increase. In such situations, to limit the risk of obsolescence, it is optimal to rely less on safety stocks and more on capital reserves.","Zhang, Weijian Shi Xianliang Huang Anqiang Hua Guowei Teunter Ruud H.",European Journal of Operational Research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2021.06.026,682

This technology has redesigned the human communication style and reshaped family interaction long before COVID-19. This study investigated the addictive nature of cell phone usage impacts on family relationships during COVID-19 lockdown. We surveyed 250 participants, participants’ age ranged from 18 years old and upward, included 64% female, 34% male, and 2% unidentified. Findings indicated that 46% of the participants preferred to be on their phone during the family time because they felt bored during COVID-19 compared with 30% who felt the same way before the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the respondents, 47% affirmed stayed on social media, video, and played games, only 15% chatted with the family members. About 54% affirmed to have experienced improvement in the family interaction. Generally, respondents agreed that the pandemic could have improved family interaction, but the addictive usage of cell phone destroyed all the advantages. Loneliness without communication with family members might have contributed to the death toll saw during COVID-19 among the citizen.

Four-month follow-up with participation in national and international competitions. Twenty-four soccer players were included, age 27.13 years (between 20 and 36). Nine (37.5%) had asymptomatic disease and 15 (62.5%) had mild symptoms. No athletes required hospitalization. Physical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic examinations did not reveal heart disease. CMRs showed ventricular thicknesses and volumes consistent with high-performance athletes. In T1, T2 and fat saturation signals, no fat infiltration or signs of edema were observed. No late enhancement after gadolinium injection. They began their training between 12 and 14 days after diagnosis. Eleven (45.8%) participated between 4 and 6 international matches of Libertadores de América International Cup. The remaining 13 completed high intensity training sessions and participated in local league competitions. At 4 months after diagnosis, none of the soccer players developed cardiac events and training and competitions were well tolerated.

However, data on mutations during the course of infection are scarce. This study aims to determine viral genome diversity in serial samples of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Targeted deep sequencing of the spike gene was performed on serial respiratory specimens from COVID-19 patients using nanopore and Illumina sequencing. Sanger sequencing was then performed to confirm the single nucleotide polymorphisms. RESULTS: A total of 28 serial respiratory specimens from 12 patients were successfully sequenced using nanopore and Illumina sequencing. A 75-year-old patient with severe disease had a mutation, G22017T, identified in the second specimen. The frequency of G22017T increased from &#8804;5% (nanopore: 3.8%; Illumina: 5%) from the first respiratory tract specimen (sputum) to &#8805;60% (nanopore: 67.7%; Illumina: 60.4%) in the second specimen (saliva; collected 2 days after the first specimen). The difference in G22017T frequency was also confirmed by Sanger sequencing. G22017T corresponds to W152L amino acid mutation in the spike protein which was only found in <0.03% of the sequences deposited into a public database. Spike amino acid residue 152 is located within the N-terminal domain, which mediates the binding of a neutralizing antibody. DISCUSSION: A spike protein amino acid mutation W152L located within a neutralizing epitope has appeared naturally in a patient. Our study demonstrated that monitoring of serial specimens is important in identifying hotspots of mutations, especially those occurring at neutralizing epitopes which may affect the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies.","Ip, Jonathan Daniel; Kok, Kin-Hang; Chan, Wan-Mui; Chu, Allen Wing-Ho; Wu, Wai-Lan; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; To, Wing-Kin; Tsang, Owen Tak-Yin; Leung, Wai-Shing; Chik, Thomas Shiu-Hong; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang",Clin. microbiol. infect,,682

However, this is a non-trivial endeavor due to the complexity of real world conditions and limits to the availability of diagnostic tests, which necessitate a bias in testing favoring symptomatic individuals. A thorough understanding of sampling confidence and bias is necessary in order make accurate conclusions. In this manuscript, we provide a stochastic model of sampling for assessing confidence in disease metrics such as trend detection, peak detection, and disease spread estimation. Our model simulates testing for a disease in an epidemic with known dynamics, allowing us to use Monte-Carlo sampling to assess metric confidence. We use this method to show that trends in the disease may be identified using under $10000$ biased samples each day, and an estimate of disease spread can be made with additional $1000-2000$ unbiased samples each day. We also demonstrate that the model can be used to assess more advanced metrics by finding the precision and recall of a strategy for finding peaks in the dynamics.","Brunner, James D.; Chia, Nicholas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02961v1.pdf,682

252631,The Necessity of Stool Examination in Asymptomatic Carriers as a Strategic Measure to Control Further Spread of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Cytokine storm syndrome (CTS) is a serious complication of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Treatment and evolution in octogenarians are not well defined. Our objective is to describe its clinical characteristics, the treatments and its clinical evolution. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective observational study of consecutive patients admitted in the period between March 23 and April 12, 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with pneumonia by radiological study or chest tomography, whith STC criteria and who received treatment. We classified patients as those who received only glucocorticoid (GC) pulses, or GC and tocilizumab pulses. We determined serum levels of ferritin, CRP and D-dimers. The final variable was survival. RESULTS: 21 patients, (80-88 years). The mean ferritin was 1056 microg/L (317-3,553), CRP 115.8mg/dL (22-306) and D-dimers 2.9m/L (0.45-17.5). All patients received GC pulses and in 2 cases simultaneously tocilizumab. The mean follow-up time was 13.7 days (8-21). The overall mortality was 38.1% (8/21 patients). The 2 patients who received tocilizumab died. The deceased had significantly higher levels of ferritin (1,254 vs. 925microg/L; P=.045) and CRP (197.6 vs. 76mg / dL; P=.007). At the end of the follow-up, a decrease in the biochemical parameters was observed with ferritin of 727microg/L, CRP of 27mg/dl and D-dimers of 1.18mg/L. In 13/21 patients (61.9%), the CTS was controlled without the need to add other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: STC mortality from SARS-CoV-2 is high despite treatment. A greater inflammatory response was associated with a higher mortality. Although it seems that the early use of GC pulses could control it, and the use of other treatments such as tocilizumab shouldo be, with the study design and its limitations, this conclusion cannot be stablished.","Callejas Rubio, José Luis; Aomar Millán, Ismael; Moreno Higueras, Manuela; Muñoz Medina, Leopoldo; López López, María; Ceballos Torres, Ángel",Rev Esp Geriatr Gerontol,,682

However, comprehensive data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are still lacking. We performed a multicenter nationwide observational study within the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS) to describe the epidemiology, clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes of the first microbiologically documented SARS-CoV-2 infection among SOT recipients. Overall, 21 patients were included with a median age of 56 years (10 kidney, 5 liver, 1 pancreas, 1 lung, 1 heart and 3 combined transplantations). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (76%), dry cough (57%), nausea (33%), and diarrhea (33%). Ninety-five percent and 24% of patients required hospital and ICU admission, respectively, and 19% were intubated. After a median of 33 days of follow-up, 16 patients were discharged, 3 were still hospitalized and 2 patients died. These data suggest that clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in middle-aged SOT recipients appear to be similar to the general population without an apparent higher rate of complications. These results need to be confirmed in larger cohorts.","Tschopp, Jonathan; L039,; Huillier, Arnaud G; Mombelli, Matteo; Mueller, Nicolas J; Khanna, Nina; Garzoni, Christian; Meloni, Dario; Papadimitriou-Olivgeris, Matthaios; Neofytos, Dionysios; Hirsch, Hans H; Schuurmans, Macé M; Müller, Thomas; Berney, Thierry; Steiger, Jürg; Pascual, Manuel; Manuel, Oriol; van Delden, Christian",Am J Transplant,,682

As the pandemic still unfolds, uncertainty circles around the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on patients with chronic diseases, including autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). To diminish the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and lessen the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the healthcare of MS patients, it is essential to understand knowledge, attitudes, and various behavioral practices related to Covid-19 among MS patients. Therefore, this study aimed to look at the behavioral practices related to Covid-19 among patients with MS. A total of 176 MS patients diagnosed at least one year before the survey were conveniently sampled online in Saudi Arabia and their data collected using a structured interview questionnaire in electronic Google form. We determined the reliability of the questionnaire by measuring its internal consistency in a pilot sample of 30 participants. Overall, more than 80% of participants had good knowledge and attitudes towards Covid-19. However, this did not correlate well with the impact on healthcare (r = 0.06). Our study revealed that 46% of participants were anxious about taking their medication, and 32% of participants missed their hospital appointments. Furthermore, 15% of the participants had a relapse but did not go to the hospital because of the pandemic, 15.9% stopped their DMTs, and 35.2% missed drug infusions or refills. Our study revealed overall good knowledge and attitudes related to Covid-19 among MS patients. However, the healthcare impact was considerable, as 32% of the participants missed their hospital appointments, and another 15% had a relapse. This highlights the significance of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the healthcare of patients with MS. Measures to mitigate the effect of the pandemic on healthcare service delivery to patients with MS, such as telemedicine, should be strongly encouraged.","Alnajashi, Hind; Jabbad, Razan",PLoS One,,682

In this review, we aimed to comprehensively summarize the current evidence on possible sources for SARS-CoV-2, including evaluation of transmission risks and effectiveness of applied prevention measures. Next to symptomatic patients, asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers are a possible source with respiratory secretions as the most likely cause for viral transmission. Air and inanimate surfaces may be sources; however, viral RNA has been inconsistently detected. Similarly, even though SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected on or in personal protective equipment (PPE), blood, urine, eyes, the gastrointestinal tract and pets, these sources are currently thought to play a negligible role for transmission. Finally, various prevention measures such as handwashing, hand disinfection, face masks, gloves, surface disinfection or physical distancing for the healthcare setting and in public are analysed for their expected protective effect.","Kampf, G; Brüggemann, Y; Kaba, H E J; Steinmann, J; Pfaender, S; Scheithauer, S; Steinmann, E",J Hosp Infect,,682

We find evidence for multiple early introductions into Georgia, despite relatively sparse sampling. Most sampled sequences likely stemmed from a single introduction from Asia at least two weeks prior to the states first detected infection. Our analysis of sequences from domestic travelers demonstrates widespread circulation of closely-related viruses in multiple U.S. states by the end of March 2020.

COVID-19 became a global pandemic in early 2020. It predominantly affects not only the upper and lower respiratory tract, but also multiple organs, including the kidney, heart, and brain. The mortality of COVID-19 patients is high in men and in elderly patients with age-related diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. The angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), a component in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), plays as cell surface receptors for SARS-CoV-2. A recent study proved that coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 also uses dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4, also known as adenosine deaminase complexing protein 2, CD26) as a co-receptor when entering cells. In addition, DPP4 is also implicated in the regulation of the immune response. Thus, the combination of DPP4 inhibition and suppression of ACE-2/RAAS may be a novel therapeutic strategy for combating this pandemic.","Phyu Khin, Phyu; Cha, Seon-Heui; Jun, Hee-Sook; Lee, Jong Han",Med.

298939,SARS-CoV-2 shifting transmission dynamics and hidden reservoirs potentially limit efficacy of public health interventions in Italy,2021,"Public concern detection provides potential guidance to the authorities for crisis management before or during a pandemic outbreak. Detecting people's concerns and attention from online social media platforms has been widely acknowledged as an effective approach to relieve public panic and prevent a social crisis. However, detecting concerns in time from massive information in social media turns out to be a big challenge, especially when sufficient manually labeled data is in the absence of public health emergencies, e.g., COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning model to identify people's concerns and the corresponding relations based on Graph Convolutional Network and Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory integrated with Concern Graph. Except for the sequential features from BERT embeddings, the regional features of tweets can be extracted by the Concern Graph module, which not only benefits the concern detection but also enables our model to be high noise-tolerant. Thus, our model can address the issue of insufficient manually labeled data. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model by using both manually labeled tweets and automatically labeled tweets. The experimental results show that our model can outperform the state-of-art models on real-world datasets.","Shi, Jingli; Li, Weihua; Yongchareon, Sira; Yang, Yi; Bai, Quan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09929v1.pdf,682

One approach to modeling open quantum systems is via a Collision Model. For instance, one could model the environment as being composed of many small quantum systems (ancillas) which interact with the target system sequentially, in a series of""collisions"". In this thesis I will discuss a novel method for constructing a continuous-time master equation from the discrete-time dynamics given by any such collision model. This new approach works for any interaction duration, $\delta t$, by interpolating the dynamics between the time-points $t = n\,\delta t$. I will contrast this with previous methods which only work in the continuum limit (as $\delta t\to 0$). Moreover, I will show that any continuum-limit-based approach will always yield unitary dynamics unless it is fine-tuned in some way. For instance, it is common to find non-unitary dynamics in the continuum limit by taking an (I will argue unphysical) divergence in the interaction strengths, $g$, such that $g^2 \delta t$ is constant as $\delta t \to 0$.","Grimmer, Daniel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10472v1.pdf,682

METHODS: The methodology adopted for this study comprises three phases: systemizing control measures adopted by different countries, identifying structural breaks in the growth of the number of cases for those countries, and analyzing Brazilian data in particular. RESULTS: We noted that China (excluding Hubei Province), Hubei Province, and South Korea have been effective in their deceleration of the growth rates of COVID-19 cases. The effectiveness of the measures taken by these countries could be seen after 1 to 2 weeks of their application. In Italy and Spain, control measures at the national level were taken at a late stage of the epidemic, which could have contributed to the high propagation of COVID-19. In Brazil, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo adopted measures that could be effective in slowing the propagation of the virus. However, we only expect to see their effects on the growth of the curve in the coming days.

310105,The Virus Evolves: Four Public Health Priorities for Reducing the Evolutionary Potential of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Excessive cytokine signaling frequently exacerbates lung tissue damage during respiratory viral infection. Type I (IFN-&#945; and IFN-ß) and III (IFN-&#955;) interferons are host-produced antiviral cytokines. Prolonged IFN-&#945; and IFN-ß responses can lead to harmful proinflammatory effects, whereas IFN-&#955; mainly signals in epithelia, thereby inducing localized antiviral immunity. In this work, we show that IFN signaling interferes with lung repair during influenza recovery in mice, with IFN-&#955; driving these effects most potently. IFN-induced protein p53 directly reduces epithelial proliferation and differentiation, which increases disease severity and susceptibility to bacterial superinfections. Thus, excessive or prolonged IFN production aggravates viral infection by impairing lung epithelial regeneration. Timing and duration are therefore critical parameters of endogenous IFN action and should be considered carefully for IFN therapeutic strategies against viral infections such as influenza and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Major, Jack; Crotta, Stefania; Llorian, Miriam; McCabe, Teresa M; Gad, Hans Henrik; Priestnall, Simon L; Hartmann, Rune; Wack, Andreas",Science,,682
310757,"Saliva Pooling Strategy for the Large-Scale Detection of SARS-CoV-2, Through Working-Groups Testing of Asymptomatic Subjects for Potential Applications in Different Workplaces",2021,"Aim: To report a case of a patient with undiagnosed endocarditis that presented as COVID-19 pneumonia. Case report: 62-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension, presented to the Emergency Department of General Hospital Koprivnica with fever and cough lasting for 7 days and general fatigue lasting for 3 weeks. Her vital signs were in physiologic range, while auscultatory she had a systolic murmur over the whole precordium with diffuse pulmonary crackles. Chest radiograph showed bilateral interstitial pneumonia whilst laboratory results displayed elevated inflammatory markers, cardiac troponin and D-dimers combined with mild partial respiratory insufficiency. She was admitted to an isolated COVID-19 ward where empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone began in parallel with dexamethasone, dalteparin and oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. During the night of admission, she became hemodynamically unstable and fluid resuscitation in conjunction with inotropes was initiated. Emergency pulmonary CT angiography ruled out pulmonary embolism and showed bilateral ground-glass changes with pleural effusion as well as signs of venous congestion. Subsequently, COVID-19 was confirmed with the RT-PCR test. After a 10-day isolation period, she was transferred to the Cardiology Department where transthoracic echocardiography was performed. Massive vegetation on the anterior mitral leaflet that caused obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract and moderate mitral regurgitation with filiform vegetation on the aortic valve were shown. Initial antibiotic therapy was swapped to amikacin and gentamicin. Further hospital stay was complicated with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, worsening of heart failure and psychological disturbance. Indication for emergency valve replacement and transfer to the University Hospital Dubrava was indicated. Intraoperatively, massive vegetation on A1/A2 section of mitral leaflet and a smaller vegetation on ventricular side of left and noncoronary cusps of the aortic valve were visible. Both valves were replaced with mechanical valves with satisfying results and the patient was returned to the parent hospital. Coagulase-negative S. aureus susceptible to vancomycin was later verified on the mitral leaflet specimen. Conclusion: Despite our focus on SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is important not to neglect other diagnosis and usefulness of echocardiography as a powerful diagnostic tool in everyday clinical practice.

333165,Epidemiology and precision of SARS-CoV-2 detection following lockdown and relaxation measures,2021,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested that the prevalence of chronic respiratory disease in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 was lower than its prevalence in the general population. The aim of this study was to assess whether chronic lung disease or use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) affects the risk of contracting severe COVID-19. METHODS: In this population cohort study, records from 1205 general practices in England that contribute to the QResearch database were linked to Public Health England's database of SARS-CoV-2 testing and English hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths for COVID-19. All patients aged 20 years and older who were registered with one of the 1205 general practices on Jan 24, 2020, were included in this study. With Cox regression, we examined the risks of COVID-19-related hospitalisation, admission to ICU, and death in relation to respiratory disease and use of ICS, adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic status and comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19. FINDINGS: Between Jan 24 and April 30, 2020, 8 256 161 people were included in the cohort and observed, of whom 14 479 (0·2%) were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, 1542 (<0·1%) were admitted to ICU, and 5956 (0·1%) died. People with some respiratory diseases were at an increased risk of hospitalisation (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] hazard ratio [HR] 1·54 [95% CI 1·45-1·63], asthma 1·18 [1·13-1·24], severe asthma 1·29 [1·22-1·37; people on three or more current asthma medications], bronchiectasis 1·34 [1·20-1·50], sarcoidosis 1·36 [1·10-1·68], extrinsic allergic alveolitis 1·35 [0·82-2·21], idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 1·59 [1·30-1·95], other interstitial lung disease 1·66 [1·30-2·12], and lung cancer 2·24 [1·89-2·65]) and death (COPD 1·54 [1·42-1·67], asthma 0·99 [0·91-1·07], severe asthma 1·08 [0·98-1·19], bronchiectasis 1·12 [0·94-1·33], sarcoidosis 1·41 [0·99-1·99), extrinsic allergic alveolitis 1·56 [0·78-3·13], idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 1·47 [1·12-1·92], other interstitial lung disease 2·05 [1·49-2·81], and lung cancer 1·77 [1·37-2·29]) due to COVID-19 compared with those without these diseases. Admission to ICU was rare, but the HR for people with asthma was 1·08 (0·93-1·25) and severe asthma was 1·30 (1·08-1·58). In a post-hoc analysis, relative risks of severe COVID-19 in people with respiratory disease were similar before and after shielding was introduced on March 23, 2020. In another post-hoc analysis, people with two or more prescriptions for ICS in the 150 days before study start were at a slightly higher risk of severe COVID-19 compared with all other individuals (ie, no or one ICS prescription): HR 1·13 (1·03-1·23) for hospitalisation, 1·63 (1·18-2·24) for ICU admission, and 1·15 (1·01-1·31) for death. INTERPRETATION: The risk of severe COVID-19 in people with asthma is relatively small. People with COPD and interstitial lung disease appear to have a modestly increased risk of severe disease, but their risk of death from COVID-19 at the height of the epidemic was mostly far lower than the ordinary risk of death from any cause. Use of inhaled steroids might be associated with a modestly increased risk of severe COVID-19.

Evidence from staggered summer breaks in Germany,2021,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with high rates of severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by rapid development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation. ARDS is considered a heterogeneous disorder and the presence of a uniform inciting agent with SARS-CoV-2 allows us to investigate subphenotypes of ARDS. We hypothesized that subphenotypes based on early lung compliance in patients with COVID-ARDS may be associated with disease outcomes including mortality. We sought to test this hypothesis in patients with COVID-ARDS. METHODS: Patients in the Yale New Haven Health System from 3/15/2020 to 5/14/2020 were included if they had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and required intubation. After exclusion for missing data or transfer from satellite facilities, 140 of patients were included for analysis. Clinical, demographic, ventilator, and laboratory parameters were abstracted from the EMR. To identify ARDS subphenotypes, we implemented unsupervised clustering using a partitioning around medoids (PAM) algorithm on average compliance over the three days following intubation. Clustering was also performed on the NHLBI ALVEOLI cohort for use as comparator. RESULTS: Patients received a median of 6.2 cc/kg of IBW on day 1 and 6.2 on day 3. Plateau pressure was less than 30cm H2O in 81% patients and driving pressure was less than 15 in 69% of patients. Median lung compliances were day 1: 30.4 mL/cm H2O [23.0-36.1];day 2: 28.7 mL/cm H2O [21.6-36.8];and day 3: 29.7 mL/cm H2O [23.2-37.6]. By Berlin criteria, 21% of patients had mild ARDS, 46% moderate, and 26% were severe. 61% of patients were proned. Using PAM, three distinct clusters based on compliance were identified (low [LC], medium [MC], and high [HC]). Median day 1 compliance in HC group was 38.0 mL/cm H2O [33.1-44.2], 29.3 [25.2-32.3] in MC, and 19.5 mL/cm H2O [16.7-22.8] in LC. Compared to the HC group, there were no differences in PEEP, day 1 P/F ratio or tidal volume, and ventilatory ratio. HC group had higher P/F ratio day 3, lower tidal volume day 3, and lower driving pressures. There were no differences in biomarkers, comorbidities, vasopressors, paralytics, or sedatives between groups. However, Kaplan-Meier plot demonstrated higher mortality in the HC group. Cox regression model demonstrated persistence of higher mortality in the HC compared to MC group. These differences were not present in the ALVEOLI cohort. CONCLUSION: In COVID-ARDS, a subphenotype characterized by early high compliance was associated with higher mortality when compared to non-COVIDARDS patients.","Alapaty, S.; Siner, J.

348857,Accuracy of rapid antigen detection test for nasopharyngeal swab specimens and saliva samples in comparison with RT-PCR and viral culture for SARS-CoV-2 detection,2021,"BACKGROUND Rhabdomyolysis is a skeletal muscle injury that has different etiologies and can be a manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Because it is a life-threatening condition, rapid diagnosis is necessary to prevent acute complications. Diagnostic criteria for rhabdomyolysis are elevated serum creatine kinase, liver enzyme levels, and myalgia. Rhabdomyolysis can easily be missed in patients with COVID-19. Herein, we report the case of a female with rhabdomyolysis as a manifestation of acute COVID-19. CASE REPORT A 35-year-old female was found to have rhabdomyolysis associated with COVID-19. Her creatine kinase and liver enzyme levels were significantly elevated. Ringer's lactate infusion was administered at a controlled rate to treat the rhabdomyolysis along with boluses of normal saline, with close monitoring of her oxygen saturation and kidney function. The patient's creatine kinase and liver enzyme levels peaked on Day 2 and then decreased. Her medical condition improved, and she was discharged on Day 4. CONCLUSIONS Our case highlights the need to monitor the creatine kinase level of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Fluid management can be challenging in patients with rhabdomyolysis due to COVID-19 because of the risk of fluid overload and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Clinicians should be aware that a significant elevation in liver enzyme levels and myalgia can be the presenting features of rhabdomyolysis in patients with COVID-19.","Alrubaye, Riyadh; Choudhury, Hasan",Am J Case Rep,,682

Identification of patients at risk for clinical deterioration upon presentation would aid in triaging, prognostication, and allocation of resources and experimental treatments. RESEARCH QUESTION: Can we develop and validate a web-based risk prediction model for identification of patients who may develop severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and/or death? METHODS: This retrospective cohort study reviewed 415 patients admitted to a large urban academic medical center and community hospitals. Covariates included demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. The independent association of predictors with severe COVID-19 was determined using multivariable logistic regression. A derivation cohort (n=311, 75%) was used to develop the prediction models. The models were tested by a validation cohort (n=104, 25%). RESULTS: The median age was 66 years (Interquartile range [IQR] 54-77) and the majority were male (55%) and non-White (65.8%). The 14-day severe COVID-19 rate was 39.3%; 31.7% required ICU, 24.6% mechanical ventilation, and 21.2% died. Machine learning algorithms and clinical judgment were used to improve model performance and clinical utility, resulting in the selection of eight predictors: age, sex, dyspnea, diabetes mellitus, troponin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase. The discriminative ability was excellent for both the severe COVID-19 (training area under the curve [AUC]=0.82, validation AUC=0.82) and mortality (training AUC= 0.85, validation AUC=0.81) models. These models were incorporated into a mobile-friendly website. INTERPRETATION: This web-based risk prediction model can be used at the bedside for prediction of severe COVID-19 using data mostly available at the time of presentation.","Woo, Sang H; Rios-Diaz, Arturo J; Kubey, Alan A; Cheney-Peters, Dianna R; Ackermann, Lily L; Chalikonda, Divya M; Venkataraman, Chantel M; Riley, Joshua M; Baram, Michael",Am. j. med. sci,,682

Female gender, older age, divorced status, lack of confidence related to security of the test, lower satisfaction of health information concerning COVID-19, history of direct or indirect contact with a COVID-19 confirmed case, live with just 1 other person, and spent >9 h/d at home were associated with greater psychological distress and/or higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. By contrast, precautionary measures, such as hand hygiene and wearing masks, were associated with lower levels of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 outbreak results in considerable psychological effects among the Mexican sample.","Cortés-Álvarez, Nadia Yanet; Piñeiro-Lamas, Regino; Vuelvas-Olmos, César Rubén",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,682
378261,Acquisition and onward transmission of a SARS-CoV-2 E484K variant among household contacts of a bamlanivimab-treated patient,2021,"Due to COVID-19, wearing a face mask to reduce virus transmission is currently mandatory in some countries when participants practice exercise in sports centers. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of wearing a surgical or FFP2 mask during a resistance training session. Fourteen people with sarcopenia (age: 59.40 ± 5.46 years; weight: 68.78 ± 8.31 kg; height: 163.84 ± 9.08 cm) that participated in the study performed three training sessions in a randomized order: 4 sets of 10 repetitions of a half-squat at 60% of the one-repetition maximum and 90 s of rest between set and were either (a) without a mask (NM), (b) wearing a surgical face mask (SM), and (c) wearing a FFP2 face mask (FFP2). We found that wearing face masks had no effect on strength performance (session mean propulsive velocity (m/s): WM: 0.396 ± 0.042; SM: 0.387 ± 0.037; and FFP2: 0.391 ± 0.042 (p = 0.918)). Additionally, no impact of wearing a mask was found on heart rate, heart rate variability, blood lactate concentration (WM: 4.17 ± 1.89; SM: 4.49 ± 2.07; and FFP2: 5.28 ± 2.45 mmol/L (p = 0.447)), or rating of perceived exertion. Wearing a surgical or FFP2 face mask during a resistance training session resulted in similar strength performance and physiological responses than the same exercise without a mask in persons with sarcopenia.","Ramos-Campo, Domingo Jesús; Pérez-Piñero, Silvia; Muñoz-Carrillo, Juan Carlos; López-Román, Francisco Javier; García-Sánchez, Esther; Ávila-Gandía, Vicente",,,682

384895,SARS-CoV-2 saliva detection test,2020,"SARS-CoV2 has caused the current pandemic of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 illness range broadly from asymptotic and mild to a life-threatening situation. This casts uncertainties for defining host determinants underlying the disease severity. Recent genetic analyses based on extensive clinical sample cohorts using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and high throughput sequencing curation revealed genetic errors and gene loci associated with about 20% of life-threatening COVID-19 cases. Significantly, most of these critical genetic loci are enriched in two immune signaling pathways, i.e., interferon-mediated antiviral signaling and chemokine-mediated/inflammatory signaling. In line with these genetic profiling studies, the broad spectrum of COVID-19 illness could be explained by immuno-pathological regulation of these critical immunogenetic pathways through various epigenetic mechanisms, which further interconnect to other vital components such as those in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) because of its direct interaction with the virus causing COVID-19. Together, key genes unraveled by genetic profiling may provide targets for precisely early risk diagnosis and prophylactic design to relieve severe COVID-19. The confounding epigenetic mechanisms may be key to understanding the clinical broadness of COVID-19 illness.","McCoy, Kendall; Peterson, Autumn; Tian, Yun; Sang, Yongming",,,682
388328,Taiwan can help-Community protection net: preventive effects of the Northern Taiwan Centralized Quarantine Center against SARS-CoV-2,2021,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is severe respiratory illnesses leading to millions of deaths worldwide in very short span. The high case fatality rate and the lack of medical counter measures emphasize for an urgent quest to develop safe and effective vaccine. Receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor on human host cell for the viral attachment and entry, hence considered as a key target to develop vaccines, antibodies and therapeutics. In this study, immunoinformatics approach was employed to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine using RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The potential B- and T-cell epitopes were selected from RBD sequence using various bioinformatics tools to design the vaccine construct. The in silico designed multi-epitope vaccine encompasses 146 amino acids with an adjuvant (human beta-defensin-2), which was further computationally evaluated for several parameters including antigenicity, allergenicity and stability. Subsequently, three-dimensional structure of vaccine construct was modelled and then docked with various toll-like receptors. Molecular dynamics (MD) study of docked TLR3-vaccine complex delineated it to be highly stable during simulation time and the stabilization of interaction was majorly contributed by electrostatic energy. The docked complex also showed low deformation and increased rigidity in motion of residues during dynamics. Furthermore, in silico cloning of the multi-epitope vaccine was carried out to generate the plasmid construct for expression in a bacterial system. Altogether, our study suggests that the designed vaccine candidate containing RBD region could provide the specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.

390927,Interpretive discrepancies caused by target values inter-batch variations in chemiluminescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG by MAGLUMI,2020,"The paper evaluates the impact of river training works designed to address problems associated with flooding on the braided-wandering Belá River in Slovakian Carpathians. This impact was investigated after the flood event in July 2018 on 11 river reaches where the river engineering and management intervention was applied. We analyzed its impact by spatio-temporal variations in river morphology (12 channel parameters) and changes in cross-section and hydraulic parameters (flow velocity, shear stress, stream power, W/D ratio) between pre- and post-flood management periods. The research hypotheses related to decreasing geodiversity in managed river reaches, a rapid increase in flow velocity during an extreme flood in river reaches where there is no sufficient floodplain inundation due to artificially high banks built by river training works, and increasing erosive force in the channel zone thanks to river management intervention were confirmed. The intervention in the braidplain area of the Belá River resulted in an undesirable simplification of the river pattern, loss of geomorphic diversity, loss of channel-floodplain connectivity, and disturbance and restraint of hydromorphological continuity. Identification of main conflicts of the Belá River management is important for clarifying the different approaches of stakeholders in the study area and aims to provide an objective illustration of their consequences. The presented analyses could help in future management issues as well as in the more critical decision-making process in vulnerable and rare braided river systems on the present when we are losing so many natural rivers by human decisions.","Kidová, Anna; Radecki-Pawlik, Artur; Rusnák, Milos; Plesinski, Karol",Sci Rep,,682

Here, we develop one kind of mesoporous/macroporous silica/platinum nanomotors with platelet membrane (PM) modification (MMNM/PM) for sequentially targeting delivery of thrombolytic and anticoagulant drugs for thrombus treatment. Regulated by the special proteins on PM, the nanomotors target the thrombus site and then PM can be ruptured under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation to achieve desirable sequential drug release, including rapid release of thrombolytic urokinase (3 hours) and slow release of anticoagulant heparin (>20 days). Meantime, the motion ability of nanomotors under NIR irradiation can effectively promote them to penetrate deeply in thrombus site to enhance retention ratio. The in vitro and in vivo evaluation results confirm that the synergistic effect of targeting ability from PM and motion ability from nanomotors can notably enhance the thrombolysis effect in both static/dynamic thrombus and rat model.","Wan, Mimi; Wang, Qi; Wang, Rongliang; Wu, Rui; Li, Ting; Fang, Dan; Huang, Yangyang; Yu, Yueqi; Fang, Leyi; Wang, Xingwen; Zhang, Yinghua; Miao, Zhuoyue; Zhao, Bo; Wang, Fenghe; Mao, Chun; Jiang, Qing; Xu, Xingquan; Shi, Dongquan",Sci.

This disease is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus (CoV)-2. In the past, other members of the coronavirus family, such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), have made an impact in China and the Arabian peninsula respectively. Both SARS and COVID-19 share similar symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing that can become fatal in later stages. However, SARS and MERS infections were epidemic diseases constrained to limited regions. By March 2020 the SARS-CoV-2 had spread across the globe and on March 11th, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic disease. In severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, many patients succumbed to pneumonia. Higher rates of deaths were seen in older patients who had co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and dementia. In this review paper, we discuss the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on CNS diseases, such as Alzheimer's-like dementia, and diabetes mellitus. We also focus on the virus genome, pathophysiology, theranostics, and autophagy mechanisms. We will assess the multiorgan failure reported in advanced stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

424147,Comprehensive Analyses of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in a Public Health Virology Laboratory,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Governments have implemented combinations of ""lockdown"" measures of various stringencies, including school and workplace closures, cancellations of public events, and restrictions on internal and external movements. These policy interventions are an attempt to shield high-risk individuals and to prevent overwhelming countries' healthcare systems, or, colloquially, ""flatten the curve."" However, these policy interventions may come with physical and psychological health harms, group and social harms, and opportunity costs. These policies may particularly affect vulnerable populations and not only exacerbate pre-existing inequities but also generate new ones. METHODS: We developed a conceptual framework to identify and categorize adverse effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures. We based our framework on Lorenc and Oliver's framework for the adverse effects of public health interventions and the PROGRESS-Plus equity framework. To test its application, we purposively sampled COVID-19 policy examples from around the world and evaluated them for the potential physical, psychological, and social harms, as well as opportunity costs, in each of the PROGRESS-Plus equity domains: Place of residence, Race/ethnicity, Occupation, Gender/sex, Religion, Education, Socioeconomic status, Social capital, Plus (age, and disability). RESULTS: We found examples of inequitably distributed adverse effects for each COVID-19 lockdown policy example, stratified by a low- or middle-income country and high-income country, in every PROGRESS-Plus equity domain. We identified the known policy interventions intended to mitigate some of these adverse effects. The same harms (anxiety, depression, food insecurity, loneliness, stigma, violence) appear to be repeated across many groups and are exacerbated by several COVID-19 policy interventions. CONCLUSION: Our conceptual framework highlights the fact that COVID-19 policy interventions can generate or exacerbate interactive and multiplicative equity harms. Applying this framework can help in three ways: (1) identifying the areas where a policy intervention may generate inequitable adverse effects; (2) mitigating the policy and practice interventions by facilitating the systematic examination of relevant evidence; and (3) planning for lifting COVID-19 lockdowns and policy interventions around the world.","Glover, Rebecca E; van Schalkwyk, May C I; Akl, Elie A; Kristjannson, Elizabeth; Lotfi, Tamara; Petkovic, Jennifer; Petticrew, Mark P; Pottie, Kevin; Tugwell, Peter; Welch, Vivian",J Clin Epidemiol,,682
429755,Evaluation of Three Commercial SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Assays and Their Performance in Two-Test Algorithms,2020,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporotic-osteoarthritis is an incapacitating musculoskeletal illness of the aged. OBJECTIVES: The anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic actions of Diclofenac were compared with apigenin-C-glycosides rich Clinacanthus nutans (CN) leaf extract in osteoporotic-osteoarthritis rats. METHODS: Female Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into five groups (n = 6). Four groups were bilateral ovariectomised for osteoporosis development, and osteoarthritis were induced by intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) into the right knee joints. The Sham group was sham-operated, received saline injection and deionized drinking water. The treatment groups were orally given 200 or 400 mg extract/kg body weight or 5 mg diclofenac /kg body weight daily for 28 days. Articular cartilage and bone changes were monitored by gross and histological structures, micro-CT analysis, serum protein biomarkers, and mRNA expressions for inflammation and catabolic protease genes. RESULTS: HPLC analysis confirmed that apigenin-C-glycosides (shaftoside, vitexin, and isovitexin) were the major compounds in the extract. The extract significantly and dose-dependently reduced cartilage erosion, bone loss, cartilage catabolic changes, serum osteoporotic-osteoarthritis biomarkers (procollagen-type-II-N-terminal-propeptide PIINP; procollagen-type-I-N-terminal-propeptide PINP; osteocalcin), inflammation (IL-1ß) and mRNA expressions for nuclear-factor-kappa-beta NF-&#954;ß, interleukin-1-beta IL-1ß, cyclooxygenase-2; and matrix-metalloproteinase-13 MMP13 activities, in osteoporotic-osteoarthritis rats comparable to Diclofenac. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that apigenin-C-glycosides at 400 mg CN extract/kg (about 0.2 mg apigenin-equivalent/kg) is comparable to diclofenac in suppressing inflammation and catabolic proteases for osteoporotic-osteoarthritis prevention.

441154,The possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a haemodialysis unit - report from a large in-hospital centre,2020,"CONTEXT: Evidence suggests that plasma glucose levels may influence cognitive performance, but this has not been systematically reviewed and quantified. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to investigate the potential effects of glucose and sucrose, compared with placebo, on cognition in healthy humans. DATA SOURCES: The electronic databases PubMed and Web of Science were searched up to December 2019. Reference lists of selected articles were checked manually. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials or crossover trials that compared glucose or sucrose with placebo for effects on cognition were eligible. DATA EXTRACTION: Potentially eligible articles were selected independently by 2 authors. Risk of bias was assessed through the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were obtained from random-effects meta-analyses for a subsample of studies that reported the same outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty-seven trials were identified, of which 35 investigated the effect of glucose consumption compared with placebo on cognition. Two studies found no effect of glucose on cognition, while the others found mixed results. Only 3 of the 37 studies investigated the effects of sucrose intake, reporting mixed results. Meta-analyses revealed a significantly positive effect of glucose compared with control, but only when a verbal performance test (immediate word recall) was used in parallel-design studies (SMD = 0.61; 95%CI, 0.20-1.02; I2â =â 0%). Twenty-four studies were classified as having high risk of bias for the selection procedure. CONCLUSIONS: A limited body of evidence shows a beneficial effect of glucose in individuals performing immediate verbal tasks. High-quality trials with standardized cognitive measurements are needed to better establish the effect of glucose or sucrose on cognition.

453582,What can cerebrospinal fluid testing and brain autopsies tell us about viral neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"The COVID-19 is a “unique” stressor, which can produce physical and psychological trauma. Coping styles can buffer this psychological impact. Consequently, this paper aims to psychometrically adapt the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) to Spanish and examines the relationships between FCV-19S, stress response, and coping strategies. The sample comprised a convenience sample of 1146 participants (12–83 years), 880 from Spain (76.8%), and 266 from Dominican Republic (23.2%). Overall, the findings support a one-factor structure for FCV-19S, consisting of 7-items, and was invariant across age, sex, occupational status, and cross-national. Therefore, indicating evidences of construct validity. Evidences of reliability were also observed (Cronbach’s α = .86, McDonald’s ω = .86, Guttmann’s λ6 = .86, greatest lower bound = .91, composite reliability = .85, and average variance extracted = .44). Moreover, as regards criterion-related validity, the mediation analysis indicated that the relationship between FCV-19S and acute stress was positive and high, with maladaptive coping styles mediating the relationship, and with a stronger mediation for men. The findings give evidences of the reliability and validity of the Spanish version of FCV-19S among Spanish-speaker participants, which provides the chance of cross-cultural studies.","Piqueras, J.

455982,Impact of both socioeconomic level and occupation on antibody prevalence to SARS-CoV-2 in an Egyptian cohort: The first episode,2021,"BACKGROUND: The hyper-accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) is the leading cause of hepatic fibrosis, and TGF-ß-induced activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is the central event of hepatic fibrosis pathogenesis. The deregulation and dysfunction of miRNAs in hepatic fibrosis have been reported previously. AIMS: To identify miRNA(s) playing a role in HSC activation and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: We analyzed online microarray expression datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for differentially expressed miRNAs in hepatic fibrosis-related disease liver tissues, examined the specific effects of the candidate miRNA on TGF-ß-induced HSC activation, and screened for the targets of the candidate miRNA in the TGF-ß/SMAD signaling. Then, the predicted miRNA-mRNA binding, the specific effects of the target mRNA, and the dynamic effects of miRNA and mRNA on TGF-ß-induced HSC activation were investigated. RESULTS: The miR-503 expression was upregulated in TGF-ß-activated HSCs. miR-503 overexpression enhanced, while miR-503 inhibition attenuated TGF-ß-induced HSC proliferation and ECM accumulation in HSCs. miR-503 targeted SMAD7 to inhibit SMAD7 expression. SMAD7 knockdown also aggravated TGF-ß-induced HSC proliferation and ECM accumulation in HSCs. The effects of miR-503 overexpression on TGF-ß-induced HSC activation were partially reversed by SMAD7 overexpression. In CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis model in rats, miR-503 overexpression aggravated, whereas SMAD7 overexpression improved CCl4-induced fibrotic changes in rats' liver tissues. The effects of miR-503 overexpression on CCl4-induced fibrotic changes were partially reversed by SMAD7 overexpression. CONCLUSION: miR-503 acts on HSC activation and hepatic fibrosis through SMAD7. The miR-503/SMAD7 axis enhances HSC activation and hepatic fibrosis through the TGF-ß/SMAD pathway.","Xie, Xia; Dou, Cheng-Yun; Zhou, Yu; Zhou, Quan; Tang, Hai-Bo",Dig. dis. sci,,682

Three different docking software were used, followed by a unification of the results by independent evaluation. Afterwards, the chemical interactions of the compounds with the targets were inspected via molecular dynamics and analyzed. The results point to a potential effectiveness of Penciclovir, Ribavirin, and Zanamivir, from a set of 48 potential candidates.

There have been several attempts to use gradient-based attribution methods to localize pathology from medical scans without using segmentation labels. This research direction has been impeded by the lack of robustness and reliability. These methods are highly sensitive to the network parameters. In this study, we introduce a robust visual explanation method to address this problem for medical applications. We provide an innovative visual explanation algorithm for general purpose and as an example application, we demonstrate its effectiveness for quantifying lesions in the lungs caused by the Covid-19 with high accuracy and robustness without using dense segmentation labels. This approach overcomes the drawbacks of commonly used Grad-CAM and its extended versions. The premise behind our proposed strategy is that the information flow is minimized while ensuring the classifier prediction stays similar.

The complications derived from the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vary due to comorbidities, sex and age, with more than 50% of the patients requiring some level of intensive care developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The authors carried out an extensive and comprehensive literature review on SARS-CoV-2 infection, the clinical, pathological, and radiological presentation as well as the current treatment strategies. AREAS COVERED: Various complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been identified, the most lethal being the acute respiratory distress syndrome, caused most likely by the presence of severe immune cell response and the concomitant alveolus inflammation. The new treatment strategies are updated, and the analysis of the physiopathology is included in this review. EXPERT OPINION: ARDS is one of the most frequent complications in patients with COVID-19. Information regarding the etiology and physiopathology are still unfolding and for the prevention and amelioration, good clinical management, adequate ventilatory support and the use of systemic corticoids seem to be the most efficient way to reduce mortality and to reduce hospital lengths.","Montenegro, Francisco; Unigarro, Luis; Paredes, Gustavo; Moya, Tatiana; Romero, Ana; Torres, Liliana; López, Juan Carlos; González, Fernando Esteban Jara; Del Pozo, Gustavo; López-Cortés, Andrés; Diaz, Ana M; Vasconez, Eduardo; Cevallos-Robalino, Doménica; Lister, Alex; Ortiz-Prado, Esteban",Expert Rev Respir Med,,682

Previous reviews have not comprehensively synthesised the evidence on the response of health and social care systems to mass bereavement events. AIM: To synthesise the evidence regarding system-level responses to mass bereavement events, including natural and human-made disasters as well as pandemics, to inform service provision and policy during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. DESIGN: A rapid systematic review was conducted, with narrative synthesis. The review protocol was registered prospectively (www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero, CRD 42020180723). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Global Health, PsycINFO and Scopus databases were searched for studies published between 2000 and 2020. Reference lists were screened for further relevant publications, and citation tracking was performed. RESULTS: Six studies were included reporting on system responses to mass bereavement following human-made and natural disasters, involving a range of individual and group-based support initiatives. Positive impacts were reported, but study quality was generally low and reliant on data from retrospective evaluation designs. Key features of service delivery were identified: a proactive outreach approach, centrally organised but locally delivered interventions, event-specific professional competencies and an emphasis on psycho-educational content. CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations in the quantity and quality of the evidence base, consistent messages are identified for bereavement support provision during the pandemic. High quality primary studies are needed to ensure service improvement in the current crisis and to guide future disaster response efforts.","Harrop, Emily; Mann, Mala; Semedo, Lenira; Chao, Davina; Selman, Lucy E; Byrne, Anthony",Palliat Med,,682

Hundreds of thousands more people with persistent olfactory dysfunction will be added to this number due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with loss-of-function mutations in SCN9A, the gene encoding NaV1.7, experience anosmia in addition to congenital insensitivity to pain. Tsp1a is a recently discovered peptide that inhibits NaV1.7 with high potency and selectivity. In this study, we examined whether a fluorescently tagged version of Tsp1a could be used to visualize normal and damaged mouse olfactory nerves. MethodsAthymic nude mice were intravenously injected with Tsp1a-IR800. As a control, mice were injected with PBS only, and as a blocking control were injected with combination of Tsp1a and Tsp1a-IR800. All mice were imaged in-vivo and epifluorescence images were acquired using an IVIS Spectrum animal imaging system. Semiquantitative analysis of the Tsp1a-IR800 signal was conducted by measuring the average radiant efficiency in the region of the olfactory epithelium/bulb (ROEB). Methimazole was used to chemically ablate the olfactory epithelium. We performed a food buried test to correlate the level of anosmia with the level of radiance efficiency. ResultsThe area of olfactory epithelium/bulb was clearly visible in epifluorescence in-vivo images of mice receiving the imaging agent. The radiant efficiency was significantly less in both mice injected with PBS and in mice injected with the blocking formulation. The mice after olfactory ablation had a significantly reduced radiant efficiency compared with normal mice. Moreover, there was a statistically significant and inverse correlation between the time required for the mouse to find buried food and the radiant efficiency. We also performed immunohistochemistry using NaV1.7 antibody. Mice after olfactory ablation as well as COVID-19-infected mice had significantly lower expression of NaV1.7 on the level of olfactory epithelium/bulb. ConclusionWe show that the fluorescent imaging of mouse olfactory epithelium/bulb is possible, suggesting that labeled Tsp1a tracers may serve as the first objective diagnostic tool of smell disorders, including those caused by COVID-19.","Adilbay, Dauren; Gonzales, Junior; Franca, Paula Demetrio de Souza; Roberts, Sheryl; Patel, Snehal; Viray, Tara; Chow, Chun Yuen; King, Glenn F; Jain, Sanjay K; Ordonez, Alvaro A; Caroll, Laurence S; Pillarsetty, Nagavarakishore; Reiner, Thomas",,,682
492336,"Response to Ribeiro da Silva et al,""Role of nonstructural proteins in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2""",2020,"Cellular function requires molecular motors to transport cargoes to their correct intracellular locations. The regulated assembly and disassembly of motor-adaptor complexes ensures that cargoes are loaded at their origin and unloaded at their destination. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, early in the cell cycle, a portion of the vacuole is transported into the emerging bud. This transport requires a myosin V motor, Myo2, which attaches to the vacuole via Vac17, the vacuole-specific adaptor protein. Vac17 also binds to Vac8, a vacuolar membrane protein. Once the vacuole is brought to the bud cortex via the Myo2-Vac17-Vac8 complex, Vac17 is degraded and the vacuole is released from Myo2. However, mechanisms governing dissociation of the Myo2-Vac17-Vac8 complex are not well understood. Ubiquitylation of the Vac17 adaptor at the bud cortex provides spatial regulation of vacuole release. Here, we report that ubiquitylation alone is not sufficient for cargo release. We find that a parallel pathway, which initiates on the vacuole, converges with ubiquitylation to release the vacuole from Myo2. Specifically, we show that Yck3 and Vps41, independent of their known roles in homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS)-mediated vesicle tethering, are required for the phosphorylation of Vac17 in its Myo2 binding domain. These phosphorylation events allow ubiquitylated Vac17 to be released from Myo2 and Vac8. Our data suggest that Vps41 is regulating the phosphorylation of Vac17 via Yck3, a casein kinase I, and likely another unknown kinase. That parallel pathways are required to release the vacuole from Myo2 suggests that multiple signals are integrated to terminate organelle inheritance.","Wong, Sara; Hepowit, Nathaniel L; Port, Sarah A; Yau, Richard G; Peng, Yutian; Azad, Nadia; Habib, Alim; Harpaz, Nofar; Schuldiner, Maya; Hughson, Frederick M; MacGurn, Jason A; Weisman, Lois S",Curr. biol,,682

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to evaluate pharmacological treatment patterns by COVID-19 severity and identify the determinants of prescribing for COVID-19. METHODS: Using electronic health record data from a large Massachusetts-based healthcare system, we identified all patients aged &#8805; 18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 1 March to 24 May, 2020. We defined five levels of COVID-19 severity at hospital admission: (1) hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen; (2-4) hospitalized and requiring oxygen &#8804; 2, 3-4, and &#8805; 5 L per minute, respectively; and (5) intubated or admitted to an intensive care unit. We assessed the medications used to treat COVID-19 or as supportive care during hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 2821 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, we found inpatient mortality increased by severity from 5% for level 1 to 23% for level 5. As compared to patients with severity level 1, those with severity level 5 were 3.53 times (95% confidence interval 2.73-4.57) more likely to receive a medication used to treat COVID-19. Other predictors of treatment were fever, low oxygen saturation, presence of co-morbidities, and elevated inflammatory biomarkers. The use of most COVID-19 relevant medications has dropped substantially while the use of remdesivir and therapeutic anticoagulants has increased over the study period.

To assess the likely evolution of firm performance going forward, this paper investigates empirically the impact of past pandemics using firm-level data on more than 537,000 nonfinancial companies from 14 developing countries during the period 1998?2018. The analysis indicates that the prevalence of infectious diseases has an economically and statistically significant negative effect on nonfinancial corporate performance. This adverse impact is particularly pronounced on smaller and younger firms, compared to larger and more established corporations. We also find that a higher number of infectious-disease cases in the population increases the probability of failure among nonfinancial firms, particularly for small and young firms. In the case of COVID-19, the magnitude of these effects will be much greater, given the unprecedented scale of the outbreak and strict policy responses to contain its spread.","Cevik, Serhan Miryugin Fedor",International Finance,,682

SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific cells were enriched in the memory compartment of acutely infected and convalescent patients several months post symptom onset. With severe acute infection, substantial populations of endemic HCoV-reactive antibody-secreting cells were identified and possessed highly mutated variable genes, signifying preexisting immunity. Finally, MBCs exhibited pronounced maturation to NP and ORF8 over time, especially in older patients. Monoclonal antibodies against these targets were non-neutralizing and non-protective in vivo.

591882,"Preparing for SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines in US Immigrant Communities: Strategies for Allocation, Distribution, and Communication",2021,"BACKGROUND: Inconsistent hand hygiene puts people who inject drugs (PWID) at high risk of infectious diseases, in particular skin and soft tissue infections. In healthcare settings, handwashing with alcohol-based hand rubs (ABRH) is recommended before aseptic procedures including intravenous injections. We aimed to evaluate the acceptability, safety and preliminary efficacy of an intervention combining ABHR provision and educational training for PWID. METHODS: A mixed-methods design was used including a pre-post quantitative study and a qualitative study. Participants were active PWID recruited in 4 harm reduction programmes of France and followed up for 6 weeks. After baseline assessment, participants received a face-to-face educational intervention. ABHR was then provided throughout the study period. Quantitative data were collected through questionnaires at baseline, and weeks 2 (W2) and 6 (W6) post-intervention. Qualitative data were collected through focus groups with participants who completed the 6-week study. RESULTS: Among the 59 participants included, 48 (81%) and 43 (73%) attended W2 and W6 visits, respectively. ABHR acceptability was high and adoption rates were 50% (W2) and 61% (W6). Only a minority of participants reported adverse skin reactions (ranging from 2 to 6%). Preliminary efficacy of the intervention was shown through increased hand hygiene frequency (multivariable linear mixed model: coef. W2 = 0.58, p = 0.002; coef. W6 = 0.61, p = 0.002) and fewer self-reported injecting-related infections (multivariable logistic mixed model: AOR W6 = 0.23, p = 0.021). Two focus groups were conducted with 10 participants and showed that young PWID and those living in unstable housing benefited most from the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: ABHR for hand hygiene prior to injection are acceptable to and safe for PWID, particularly those living in unstable housing. The intervention’s educational component was crucial to ensure adoption of safe practices. We also provide preliminary evidence of the intervention’s efficacy through increased hand hygiene frequency and a reduced risk of infection.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic literature review investigating treatment of neurosurgical patients via telemedicine, and to evaluate barriers and challenges. Additionally, we review recent regulatory changes that affect telemedicine in neurosurgery, and our institution's initial experience. METHODS: A systematic review was performed including all studies investigating success regarding treatment of neurosurgical patients via telemedicine. We reviewed our department's outpatient clinic billing records after telemedicine was implemented from 3/23/2020 to 4/6/2020 and reviewed modifier 95 inclusion to determine the number of face-to-face and telemedicine visits, as well as breakdown of weekly telemedicine clinic visits by subspecialty. RESULTS: A total of 52 studies (25 prospective and 27 retrospective) with 45 801 patients were analyzed. A total of 13 studies were conducted in the United States and 39 in foreign countries. Patient management was successful via telemedicine in 99.6% of cases. Telemedicine visits failed in 162 cases, 81.5% of which were due to technology failure, and 18.5% of which were due to patients requiring further face-to-face evaluation or treatment. A total of 16 studies compared telemedicine encounters to alternative patient encounter mediums; telemedicine was equivalent or superior in 15 studies. From 3/23/2020 to 4/6/2020, our department had 122 telemedicine visits (65.9%) and 63 face-to-face visits (34.1%). About 94.3% of telemedicine visits were billed using face-to-face procedural codes.

However, graphs do not natively capture the multi-way relationships present among genes and proteins in biological systems. Hypergraphs are generalizations of graphs that naturally model multi-way relationships and have shown promise in modeling systems such as protein complexes and metabolic reactions. In this paper we seek to understand how hypergraphs can more faithfully identify, and potentially predict, important genes based on complex relationships inferred from genomic expression data sets. RESULTS: We compiled a novel data set of transcriptional host response to pathogenic viral infections and formulated relationships between genes as a hypergraph where hyperedges represent significantly perturbed genes, and vertices represent individual biological samples with specific experimental conditions. We find that hypergraph betweenness centrality is a superior method for identification of genes important to viral response when compared with graph centrality. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the utility of using hypergraphs to represent complex biological systems and highlight central important responses in common to a variety of highly pathogenic viruses.

598446,Self‐collected saliva for SARS‐CoV‐2 detection: A prospective study in the emergency room,2021-02-23,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has become a global threat. It has become very difficult to control the spreading of the virus. The virus is a RNA virus and the virulence of the virus is mediated by three virulence causing proteins, viz., Nsp1, Nsp3c and ORF7. So far the drug designing endeavors against the virus have been being targeted towards the spike protein which is responsible for the entry of the virus inside human host as well as the RNA dependent RNA polymerase. However, no effective treatment against the virus has so far been developed. In the present situation, an attempt has been made to target the virulence protein factor Nsp1 which binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit of the human host. We tried to target the Nsp1 by in-silico virtual screening of ligand libraries. We built the three dimensional structure of Nsp1 and used the structure to screen the ChEMBL drug library. We used molecular docking simulations of the top6 screened ligands with Nsp1 and subjected the liagnd-Nsp1 complexes to molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the behaviors of the ligands in a virtual cell. From our analysis we could predict that the ligands bearing the ChEMBL identifiers, CHEMBL1096281, CHEMBL2022920, CHEMBL175656, had the best binding affinity values with Nsp1. Therefore, these ligand molecules may be tested in wet-lab for further analysis. This is the first report to target the virulence factor Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

599743,Simulated Sunlight Rapidly Inactivates SARS-CoV-2 on Surfaces,2020-05-20,"Background: Recent studies revealed a high prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) events in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, especially in those who are critically ill. Available studies report varying prevalence rates. Hence, the exact prevalence remains uncertain. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate regarding the appropriate dosage of thromboprophylaxis. Methods: We performed a systematic review and proportion meta-analysis following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies exploring the prevalence of VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients till 25/07/2020. We pooled the proportion of VTE. Additionally, in a subgroup analysis, we pooled VTE events detected by systematic screening. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we compared the odds of VTE in patients on prophylactic compared with therapeutic anticoagulation. Results: The review comprised 24 studies and over 2,500 patients. The pooled proportion of VTE prevalence was 0.31 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24, 0.39; I(2) 94%], of VTE utilizing systematic screening was 0.48 (95% CI 0.33, 0.63; I(2) 91%), of deep venous thrombosis was 0.23 (95% CI 0.14, 0.32; I(2) 96%), and of pulmonary embolism was 0.14 (95% CI 0.09, 0.20; I(2) 90%). Exploratory analysis of few studies, utilizing systematic screening, VTE risk increased significantly with prophylactic, compared with therapeutic anticoagulation [odds ratio (OR) 5.45; 95% CI 1.90, 15.57; I(2) 0%]. Discussion: Our review revealed a high prevalence of VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Almost 50% of patients had VTE detected by systematic screening. Higher thromboprophylaxis dosages may reduce VTE burden in this patient's cohort compared with standard prophylactic anticoagulation; however, this is to be ascertained by ongoing randomized controlled trials.","Mohamed, Mouhand F.

Previously, we modeled Social Distancing with t/dbl as a linear function of time, where N[t]=1exp[+K/A t/(1+ gamma/o t)] is used here. Additional parameters besides {K/o,gamma/o} are needed to better model different rho[t]=dN[t]/dt shapes. Thus, a new Orthogonal Function Model [OFM] is developed here using these orthogonal function series: N(Z) = sum[m=0,M/F] g/m L/m(Z) exp[-Z] , R(Z) = sum[m=0,M/F] c/m L/m(Z) exp[-Z] , where N(Z) and Z[t] form an implicit N[t]=N(Z[t]) function, giving: G/o = [K/A / gamma/o ] , Z[t] = +[ G/o / (1+ gamma/ot) ] , rho[t] = [ gamma/o / G/o ] (Z^2) R(Z) , with L/m(Z) being the Laguerre Polynomials. At large M/F values, nearly arbitrary functions for N[t] and rho[t]=dN[t]/dt can be accommodated. How to determine {K/A, gamma/o} and the {g/m; m=(0,+M/F)} constants from any given N(Z) dataset is derived, with rho[t] set by: c/(M/F - k) = sum[m=0,k] g/m . The bing.com USA CoVID-19 data was analyzed using M/F=(0,1,2) in the OFM. All results agreed to within about 10 percent, showing model robustness. Averaging over all these predictions gives the following overall estimates for the number of USA CoVID-19 cases at the pandemic end: = 5,009,677 (+/-) 269,450 (data to 5/3/20), and = 4,422,803 (+/-) 162,580 (data to 6/7/20), which compares the pre- and post-early May bing.com revisions.

New York Haredi-Orthodox Jewish communities represent a group that have been heavily impacted by Covid-19. Little research has examined their experience or perceptions toward Covid-19 and vaccines. We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study to explore the experience of Covid-19 among Haredim. Paper surveys were self-administered between December 2020 and January 2021 in Haredi neighborhood pediatricians’ offices in Brooklyn, New York.

Participants trusted their physicians, Orthodox medical organizations, and rabbinic leaders for medical information. Knowledge of Covid-19 transmission and risk was good (69% answered ≥ 4/6 questions correctly). Only 12% of respondents would accept a Covid-19 vaccine, 41% were undecided and 47% were strongly hesitant. Independent predictors of strong vaccine hesitancy included believing natural infection to be better than vaccination for developing immunity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23–14.86), agreement that prior infection provides a path toward resuming communal life (aOR 4.10; 95% CI 1.22–13.77), and pandemic-related loss of trust in physicians (aOR 5.01; 95% CI 1.05–23.96).

However, milk is also a rich collection of antimicrobial substances, which provide protection against pathogenic infections. These molecules safeguard the integrity of the lactating mammary gland, but also provide protection for the suckling offspring during a time when its immune system is still immature. The protective substances can be classified into two categories: 1) nonspecific defense substances, which provide innate immunity, and 2) molecules such as antibodies, which provide adaptive immunity and are directed against specific pathogens. The antimicrobial potency of milk has not been a target for farm animal breeding in the past, and present day ruminants provide suboptimal levels of antimicrobial substances in milk. Altered breeding regimes, pharmacological intervention, and transgenesis can be utilized to improve the antimicrobial properties of milk.

Not every suspected case undergoes testing, because testing kits and other equipment are limited in many parts of the world. Yet populations increasingly use the internet to manage both home and work life during the pandemic, giving researchers mediated connections to millions of people sheltering in place. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of using an online news platform to recruit volunteers willing to report COVID-19like symptoms and behaviors. METHODS: An online epidemiologic survey captured COVID-19related symptoms and behaviors from individuals recruited through banner ads offered through Microsoft News. Respondents indicated whether they were experiencing symptoms, whether they received COVID-19 testing, and whether they traveled outside of their local area. RESULTS: A total of 87,322 respondents completed the survey across a 3-week span at the end of April 2020, with 54.3% of the responses from the United States and 32.0% from Japan. Of the total respondents, 19,631 (22.3%) reported at least one symptom associated with COVID-19. Nearly two-fifths of these respondents (39.1%) reported more than one COVID-19like symptom. Individuals who reported being tested for COVID-19 were significantly more likely to report symptoms (47.7% vs 21.5%; P<.001). Symptom reporting rates positively correlated with per capita COVID-19 testing rates (R(2)=0.26; P<.001). Respondents were geographically diverse, with all states and most ZIP Codes represented. More than half of the respondents from both countries were older than 50 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: News platforms can be used to quickly recruit study participants, enabling collection of infectious disease symptoms at scale and with populations that are older than those found through social media platforms. Such platforms could enable epidemiologists and researchers to quickly assess trends in emerging infections potentially before at-risk populations present to clinics and hospitals for testing and/or treatment.","Dixon, Brian E; Mukherjee, Sumit; Wiensch, Ashley; Gray, Mary L; Ferres, Juan M Lavista; Grannis, Shaun J",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/24742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872190/,682

By day 60 after ICU admission, 52% of the patients had been discharged. 60-day mortality rate was 32%; 37% for ventilated patients, and 42% for those requiring both: ventilation and renal replacement therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Early deterioration might be seen as a warning signal for unfavourable outcome. Lung-protective ventilation including prone positioning remain the mainstay of the treatment.","Heim, Markus; Lahmer, Tobias; Rasch, Sebastian; Kriescher, Silja; Berg-Johnson, Wiebke; Fuest, Kristina; Kapfer, Barbara; Schneider, Gerhard; Spinner, Christoph D.; Geisler, Fabian; Wießner, Johannes R.; Rothe, Kathrin; Feihl, Susanne; Ranft, Andreas",Multidiscip Respir Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907624/; https://doi.org/10.4081/mrm.2021.744,682
637950,Asymptomatic Patient Testing After 10:1 Pooling Using the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 Assay,2021-01-05,"Gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) allows the fast, reliable, and inexpensive chemical composition analysis of volatile mixtures. This sensing technology has been successfully employed in food science to determine food origin, freshness and preventing alimentary fraud. However, GC-IMS data is highly dimensional, complex, and suffers from strong non-linearities, baseline problems, misalignments, peak overlaps, long peak tails, etc., all of which must be corrected to properly extract the relevant features from samples. In this work, a pipeline for signal pre-processing, followed by four different approaches for feature extraction in GC-IMS data, is presented. More precisely, these approaches consist of extracting data features from: (1) the total area of the reactant ion peak chromatogram (RIC); (2) the full RIC response; (3) the unfolded sample matrix; and (4) the ion peak volumes. The resulting pipelines for data processing were applied to a dataset consisting of two different quality class Iberian ham samples, based on their feeding regime. The ability to infer chemical information from samples was tested by comparing the classification results obtained from partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and the samples' variable importance for projection (VIP) scores. The choice of a feature extraction strategy is a trade-off between the amount of chemical information that is preserved, and the computational effort required to generate the data models.","Freire, Rafael; Fernandez, Luis; Mallafré-Muro, Celia; Martín-Gómez, Andrés; Madrid-Gambin, Francisco; Oliveira, Luciana; Pardo, Antonio; Arce, Lourdes; Marco, Santiago",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21186156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577363/,682

While face masks are effective in slowing down the spread of the virus, they also make face-to-face communication more challenging. The present study sought to examine the impact of face masks on listeners' intelligibility and recall of sentences produced by one German native adult and one child talker. In the intelligibility task, German native adult listeners watched video clips of either an adult or a child talker producing sentences with and without a face mask. In a cued-recall experiment, another group of German native listeners watched the same video clips and then completed a cued-recall task. The results showed that face masks significantly affected listeners' intelligibility and recall performance, and this effect was equally true for both talkers. The findings here contribute to the fast growing and urgent research regarding the impact of face masks on communication.","Truong, Thanh Lan; Weber, Andrea",J Acoust Soc Am,https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0006098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34598631/,682

When preventative measures alone are inadequate, oral nifedipine is generally recommended as first-line pharmacologic therapy. Given the natural course of this spontaneously remitting/relapsing condition, controls are needed to critically appraise studies and determine the value of treatments. We report a systematic review of placebo-controlled or comparative therapeutic trials for the treatment of idiopathic chilblains. Our search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases, identified 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria for a combined study population n = 576. Therapies included nifedipine, pentoxifylline, tadalafil, topical glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), topical minoxidil, diltiazem, corticosteroids, and vitamin D. There was moderate evidence to support the use of nifedipine and pentoxifylline in the treatment of severe or refractory cases of idiopathic chilblains, while other therapies had inadequate evidence or nonsignificant results compared to placebo.","Pratt, Michelle; Mahmood, Farhan; Kirchhof, Mark G.",J Cutan Med Surg,https://doi.org/10.1177/1203475421995130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33653127/,682

Vaccine trials excluded nursing home (NH) residents, limiting adverse event data that directly apply to this population. METHODS: To prospectively monitor for potential adverse events associated with vaccination, we used Electronic Health Record (EHR) data from Genesis HealthCare, the largest NH provider in the United States. EHR data on vaccinations and pre-specified adverse events were updated daily and monitored for signal detection among residents of 147 facilities who received the first dose of vaccine between December 18, 2020 and January 3, 2021. For comparison, unvaccinated residents during the same time period were included from 137 facilities that started vaccinating at least 15 days after the vaccinating-facilities. RESULTS: As of January 3, 2021, 8553 NH residents had received one dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and by February 20, 2021, 8371 residents had received their second dose of vaccine; 11,072 were included in the unvaccinated comparator group. No significant associations were noted for neurologic outcomes, anaphylaxis, or cardiac events.

Importantly, provider stress is also connected to patient care, with recent research on Canada’s opioid crisis finding that compassion satisfaction and burnout are linked to the perpetuation of negative attitudes and behaviours towards people with opioid use problems. In 2017, the Fraser Health Authority developed a training program for direct service providers designed to address this important connection—a mental health and resiliency program based in the principles of trauma-informed practice and care. This article reports the results of an evaluation of this program. Findings suggest that embedding resiliency and self-compassion within trauma-informed training programs is a promising approach for cultural change in healthcare practice. Leaders are encouraged to explore how such a model may be implementable for their own organizations and departments.","Knaak, Stephanie; Sandrelli, Marika; Patten, Scott",Healthc Manage Forum,https://doi.org/10.1177/0840470420970594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33153321/,682

647052,SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Among Incarcerated People: A Barrier to Overcome,2021-08-12,"BACKGROUND: The primary method of surveillance for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 is with nasopharyngeal swabs. Given the significant demand for nasopharyngeal swabs, a large number of previously untrained and unfamiliar staff are now performing this test. It was noted that there was significant heterogeneity in instructions for performing nasopharyngeal swabs in Canada, in contrast to the guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The objective of this study was to review the instructions provided across Canada and contrast them to those of the CDC and PAHO. METHODS: A standard series of steps for nasopharyngeal swab performance was outlined based on the CDC, PAHO, and New England Journal of Medicine instructions. A comprehensive search was performed in August 2020 to identify nasopharyngeal swab guidelines provided by public health in the provinces and territories of Canada. Regional health authority guidance was also collected. Instructions provided were contrasted against the standardized steps. RESULTS: Instructions were identified for all provinces and territories, and for 81 regional health authorities. From the provincial and territorial guidelines, 10/13 (77%) cleared the nasal passages before swab insertion, 11/13 (85%) tilted the patient’s head back slightly, 12/13 (92%) inserted the swab parallel to the palate, but only 3/13 (23%) inserted the swab to at least a depth of two-thirds the distance between the patient’s nose and ear. A clear majority (81%) of regional health authority guidelines followed their respective provincial guidelines. For depth of insertion, Quebec provided a pictogram but no distance or technique for estimation. Six provinces and territories - Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Alberta - recommended 4 cm or one-half the distance from nostrils to ear. British Columbia and Manitoba recommended a 7 cm depth of insertion. Nova Scotia recommended one-half to two-thirds the distance from nose to ear. Lastly, Newfoundland, New Brunswick and the Yukon recommended an insertion from nose to the external ear canal. CONCLUSION: There is significant heterogeneity in guidance for nasopharyngeal swab performance across Canada. The instructions provided by the majority of provinces and territories in Canada would not be effective in reaching the nasopharynx.

Such life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is heralded by virus-induced activation of mononuclear phagocytes (MPs; monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells). MPs play substantial roles in aberrant immune secretory activities affecting profound systemic inflammation and end organ malfunctions. All follow an abortive viral infection. To elucidate SARS-CoV-2-MP interactions we investigated transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of human monocyte-derived macrophages. While expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, paralleled monocyte-macrophage differentiation it failed to affect productive viral infection. In contrast, simple macrophage viral exposure led to robust pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression but attenuated type I interferon (IFN) activity. Both paralleled dysregulation of innate immune signaling pathways specifically those linked to IFN. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2-infected host mounts a robust innate immune response characterized by a pro-inflammatory storm heralding consequent end-organ tissue damage.","Abdelmoaty, Mai M.; Yeapuri, Pravin; Machhi, Jatin; Olson, Katherine E.; Shahjin, Farah; Zhou, You; Jingjing, Liang; Pandey, Kabita; Acharya, Arpan; Byrareddy, Siddappa N.; Lee Mosley, R.; Gendelman, Howard E.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34268510/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.07.449660,682
650347,Reverse Transcription Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assay for the Detection of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,2013-12-12,"A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused the current coronavirus disease (Covid-19) epidemic. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. Under ideal conditions, RT-qPCR Covid-19 assays have analytical sensitivity and specificity greater than 95%. However, when the sample panel is enlarged including asymptomatic individuals, the sensitivity decreases and false negatives are reported. Moreover, RT-qPCR requires up to 3–6 h with most of the time involved in RNA extraction from swab samples. We introduce CovidArray, a microarray-based assay, to detect SARS-CoV-2 markers N1 and N2 in the nasopharyngeal swabs. The method is based on solid-phase hybridization of fluorescently-labeled amplicons upon RNA extraction and reverse transcription. This approach combines the physical-optical properties of the silicon substrate with the surface chemistry used to coat the substrate to obtain a diagnostic tool of great sensitivity. Furthermore, we used an innovative approach, RNAGEM, to extract and purify viral RNA in less than 15 min. We correctly assigned 12 nasopharyngeal swabs, previously analyzed by RT-qPCR. Thanks to the CovidArray sensitivity we were able to identify a false-negative sample. CovidArray is the first DNA microarray-based assay to detect viral genes in the swabs. Its high sensitivity and the innovative viral RNA extraction by RNAGEM allows the reduction of both the amount of false-negative results and the total analysis time to about 2 h.","Damin, Francesco; Galbiati, Silvia; Gagliardi, Stella; Cereda, Cristina; Dragoni, Francesca; Fenizia, Claudio; Savasi, Valeria; Sola, Laura; Chiari, Marcella",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33916661/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21072490,682

In the majority of cases, the cause of the fever is unknown. Although respiratory viruses are commonly associated with this condition, the etiologic significance of this finding remains unclear and is therefore the subject of this study. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected during 87 episodes of febrile neutropenia in children age 0–18 years, being treated at a children’s oncology unit between January 2013 and June 2014. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the presence of 16 respiratory viruses. Follow-up samples were collected from children who tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Rhinoviruses were genotyped by VP4/VP2 sequencing. Fisher’s exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for group comparisons. RESULTS: At least one respiratory virus was detected in samples from 39 of 87 episodes of febrile neutropenia (45%), with rhinoviruses the most frequently detected. Follow-up samples were collected after a median of 28 days (range, 9–74 days) in 32 of the 39 virus-positive episodes. The respiratory viral infection had resolved in 25 episodes (78%). The same virus was detected at follow-up in one coronavirus and six rhinovirus episodes. Genotyping revealed a different rhinovirus species in two of the six rhinovirus infections. CONCLUSION: The frequency of respiratory viral infections in this group of patients suggests an etiologic role in febrile neutropenia. However, these findings must be confirmed in larger patient cohorts.","Söderman, Martina; Rhedin, Samuel; Tolfvenstam, Thomas; Rotzén-Östlund, Maria; Albert, Jan; Broliden, Kristina; Lindblom, Anna",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27309354/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0157398,682

MATERIALS AND METHODS: During an outpatient follow-up visit, chest CT, pulmonary function and COVID-19 related symptoms were assessed approximately 10 weeks after diagnosis. Demographics, baseline (time of diagnosis) CT score and blood results were collected from patient files. Association between lung function and clinical characteristics (baseline), blood markers (baseline), chest CT (baseline and follow-up) and symptom score (followup) was analysed. Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi squared tests were used for statistical comparison between subgroups with and without restriction. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Two hundred-twenty subjects were evaluated at a median follow-up of 74±12 (SD) days. Median symptom and median CT score at follow-up were 1(IQR=0- 2) and 2(IQR=0-6) respectively. Forty-six percent of patients had normal lung function, while TLC and TLCO below the lower limit of normal were observed in 38% and 22% of subjects respectively. This restrictive pulmonary impairment was associated with length of hospital stay (8 vs 6 days; p=0.003), admission to the intensive care unit (27% vs 13%;p=0.009), and invasive mechanical ventilation (10% vs 0.7%;p=0.001), but not with symptom score or CT score at baseline and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Fifty-four percent of COVID-19 survivors had abnormal lung function 10 weeks after diagnosis. Restriction was the most prevalent pulmonary function, with the more critically ill patients being more prone to this condition. Yet, restriction could not be linked with abnormal imaging results or residual symptoms.","Smet, Jelle; Stylemans, Dimitri; Hanon, Shane; Verbanck, Sylvia; Vanderhelst, Eef; Ilsen, Bart",Respir Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33278758/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611120304169; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611120304169?v=s5,682
653549,SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are associated with lower RT-PCR amplification cycles between January and March 2021 in France,2021-10-01,"BACKGROUND: Community health workers (CHWs) play a critical role in grassroots healthcare and are essential for achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals. While there is a critical shortage of essential health workers in low- and middle-income countries, WHO and international partners have reached a consensus on the need to expand and strengthen CHW programmes as a key element in achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC). The COVID-19 pandemic has further revealed that emerging health challenges require quick local responses such as those utilizing CHWs. This is the second paper of our 11-paper supplement, “Community health workers at the dawn of a new era”. Our objective here is to highlight questions, challenges, and strategies for stakeholders to consider while planning the introduction, expansion, or strengthening of a large-scale CHW programme and the complex array of coordination and partnerships that need to be considered. METHODS: The authors draw on the outcomes of discussions during key consultations with various government leaders and experts from across policy, implementation, research, and development organizations in which the authors have engaged in the past decade. These include global consultations on CHWs and global forums on human resources for health (HRH) conferences between 2010 and 2014 (Montreux, Bangkok, Recife, Washington DC). They also build on the authors’ direct involvement with the Global Health Workforce Alliance. RESULTS: Weak health systems, poor planning, lack of coordination, and failed partnerships have produced lacklustre CHW programmes in countries. This paper highlights the three issues that are generally agreed as being critical to the long-term effectiveness of national CHW programmes—planning, coordination, and partnerships. Mechanisms are available in many countries such as the UHC2030 (formerly International Health Partnership), country coordinating mechanisms (CCMs), and those focusing on the health workforce such as the national Human Resources for Health Observatory and the Country Coordination and Facilitation (CCF) initiatives introduced by the Global Health Workforce Alliance. CONCLUSION: It is imperative to integrate CHW initiatives into formal health systems. Multidimensional interventions and multisectoral partnerships are required to holistically address the challenges at national and local levels, thereby ensuring synergy among the actions of partners and stakeholders. In order to establish robust and institutionalized processes, coordination is required to provide a workable platform and conducive environment, engaging all partners and stakeholders to yield tangible results.","Afzal, Muhammad Mahmood; Pariyo, George W.; Lassi, Zohra S.; Perry, Henry B.",Health Res Policy Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34641912/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-021-00753-7,682

STUDY DESIGN: Exploratory studies were conducted using spleens from septic patients and from mice with abdominal sepsis. Seven patients with sepsis after injury were identified retrospectively and compared with six injured patients. C57BL/6 male mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture, or to IP lipopolysaccharide. Control mice had sham laparotomy or injection of IP saline, respectively. A sepsis classification model was created and tested on blood samples from septic mice. RESULTS: Accuracy of sepsis prediction was obtained using cross-validation of gene expression data from 12 human spleen samples and from 16 mouse spleen samples. For blood studies, classifiers were constructed using data from a training data set of 26 microarrays. The error rate of the classifiers was estimated on seven de-identified microarrays, and then on a subsequent cross-validation for all 33 blood microarrays. Estimates of classification accuracy of sepsis in human spleen were 67.1%; in mouse spleen, 96%; and in mouse blood, 94.4% (all estimates were based on nested cross-validation). Lists of genes with substantial changes in expression between study and control groups were used to identify nine mouse common inflammatory response genes, six of which were mapped into a single pathway using contemporary pathway analysis tools. CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis induces changes in mouse leukocyte gene expression that can be used to diagnose sepsis apart from systemic inflammation.","Chung, T.

Understanding the socioeconomic, demographic and health determinants affecting the pandemic is of interest to stakeholders. The purpose of this ecological study is to analyse the effect of the different socioeconomic, demographic and healthcare determinants on the mortality rate and estimated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 first wave in the Spanish regions. METHODS: From the available data of the 17 Spanish regions (Autonomous Communities), we have carried out an ecological study through multivariate linear regression using ordinary least squares. To do this, we conducted an analysis using two distinct dependent variables: the logarithm of mortality rate per 1,000,000 inhabitants and the estimated cumulative incidence. The study has 12 explanatory variables. RESULTS: After applying the backward stepwise multivariate analysis, we obtained a model with nine significant variables at different levels for mortality rate and a model with seven significant variables for estimated cumulative incidence. Among them, six variables are statistically significant and of the same sign in both models: “Nursing homes beds”, “Proportion of care homes over 100 beds”, “Log GDP per capita”, “Aeroplane passengers”, “Proportion of urban people”, and the dummy variable “Island region”.

Various social and environmental factors contribute to inadequate food access and availability in rural areas, influencing dietary intakes and food insecurity rates. This study aims to identify patterns related to food insecurity and fruit and vegetable consumption within a SNAP-eligible and low-income, highly obese rural Appalachian community. A prospective cohort was implemented to identify gaps in resources addressing obesity and food insecurity challenges. SAS 9.4 software was used to examine differences in dietary intakes and shopping practices among SNAP participants. Among participants (n = 152), most reported an annual household income less than USD 20,000 (n = 90, 60.4%), 29.1% reported food insecurity, and 39.5% reported receiving SNAP benefits within the last month. The overall mean FV intake was 3.46 daily servings (95% CI: 3.06–3.91) among all participants. SNAP participation was associated with food insecurity (p = 0.007) and those participating in SNAP were two times more likely to report being food insecure (OR = 2.707, 95% CI: 1.317, 5.563), relative to non-participants.

675378,The Origin of Sars-CoV-2: Why It Matters,2021-09-08,"Sensitization of the humoral immune response to invading viruses and production of antiviral antibodies forms part of the host antiviral repertoire. Paradoxically, for a number of viral pathogens, under certain conditions, antibodies provide an attractive means of enhanced virus entry and replication in a number of cell types. Known as antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, the phenomenon occurs when virus‐antibody immunocomplexes interact with cells bearing complement or Fc receptors, promoting internalization of the virus and increasing infection. Frequently associated with exacerbation of viral disease, ADE of infection presents a major obstacle to the prevention of viral disease by vaccination and is thought to be partly responsible for the adverse effects of novel antiviral therapeutics such as intravenous immunoglobulins. There is a growing body of work examining the intracellular signaling pathways and epitopes responsible for mediating ADE, with a view to aiding rational design of antiviral strategies. With in vitro studies also confirming ADE as a feature of infection for a growing number of viruses, challenges remain in understanding the multilayered molecular mechanisms of ADE and its effect on viral pathogenesis.","Taylor, Adam; Foo, Suan‐Sin; Bruzzone, Roberto; Vu Dinh, Luan; King, Nicholas J.

675564,Asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infections in pregnant patients in an Italian city during complete lockdown,2020-08-25,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented one of the biggest challenges to healthcare providers worldwide. The appropriate use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) has been essential to ensuring staff and patient safety. To counteract sub-optimal PPE practice, a PPE helper programme was developed at a large London hospital group. Based on a behaviour change model of Capability, Opportunity and Motivation (COM-B), the programme provided PPE support, advice and education to ward staff. AIM: Evaluation of the PPE Helper Programme. METHODS: Clinical and non-clinical ward staff completed a questionnaire informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework and COM-B. The questionnaire was available in paper and electronic versions. Quantitative responses were analysed using descriptive and non-parametric statistics, free-text responses were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: Over a six-week period, PPE helpers made 268 ward visits. Overall, 261 questionnaires were available for analysis. Across the Trust, 68% of respondents reported having had contact with a PPE helper. Staff who had encountered a PPE helper responded significantly more positively to a range of statements about using PPE than those who had not. Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) staff were significantly more anxious in relation to the adequacy of PPE. Non-clinical and redeployed staff (e.g. domestic staff) were most positive about the impact of PPE helpers. Free-text comments showed that staff found the programme supportive and would have liked it earlier in the pandemic. CONCLUSION: A PPE Helper programme is a feasible and beneficial intervention for providing support, advice and education to ward staff during infectious disease outbreaks.","Castro-Sánchez, E.; CM, Alexander; C, Atchison; D, Patel; W, Leung; ME, Calamita; Garcia D, Meno; C, Cimpeanu; JM, Mumbwatasai; D, Ramid; K, Doherty; HS, Grewal; JA, Otter; M, Wells",J Hosp Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670120305570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33307145/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.12.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120305570?v=s5,682

At the state of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in the diagnostic testing was limited with many asymptomatic cases. Irrespective of symptom severity, antibodies develop within two to three weeks after disease onset and may persist 6 months or more, antibody surveillance is an important tool for tracking trends in past infections across diverse populations. This study includes adults and children recruited from a statewide sample of past 2014-2020 Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) participants. SHOW, an ongoing population-based health examination study including a randomly selected sample of households, partnered with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene to conduct longitudinal antibody surveillance using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test. WAVEs I and II of three planned WAVES were complete in mid-summer to late fall respectively, WAVE III is planned for early 2021. From WAVE I to WAVE II, crude estimates of seroprevalence in the total study population increased four to five-fold from 1.9% to 7.3%. Within the statewide probability sample, weighted estimates increased from an estimated 1.6% (95% CI:0.6-2.5%) seropositivity to 6.8% (95% CI:4.3-9.4%). Seroprevalence varied by health region in both waves, and significant disparities in smaller population groups were identified. This public health and academic partnership provides critical data for public health response to the pandemic and lays the foundation for future research into longer-term immunity, health impacts and population level disparities.","Malecki, K.; Nikodemova, M.; Schultz, A.

To provide scientific data to help identify risk-factors for the psychosocial strain during the COVID-19 outbreak, an international cross-disciplinary online survey was circulated in April 2020. This report outlines the mental, emotional and behavioural consequences of COVID-19 home confinement. Method: Thirty-five research organisations from four continents promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in Ten different languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement period. Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Western-Asia (36%), North-Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other countries (3%) were analysed. The COVID-19 home confinement evoked a negative effect on mental wellbeing and emotional status (P < 0.001; 0.43 [≤] d [≤] 0.65) with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing psychosocial and emotional disorders (10% to 16.5%). These psychosocial tolls were associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing (i) physical (+15.2%) and social (71.2%) inactivity, (ii) poor sleep quality (12.8%), (iii) unhealthy diet behaviours (10%), and (iv) unemployment (6%). Conversely, participants demonstrated a greater use (15%) of technology solutions during the confinement period. Conclusion: These findings elucidate the risk of psychosocial strain during the current home confinement period and provide a clear remit for the urgent implementation of technology-based intervention to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle (AHCL).","AMMAR, A.; Trabelsi, K.; Brach, M.; Chtourou, H.; Boukhris, O.; Masmoudi, L.; Bouaziz, B.; Bentlage, E.; How, D.; Ahmed, M.; Mueller, P.; Mueller, N.; Aloui, A.; Hammouda, O.; Paineiras-Domingos, L.

A thorough analysis of the official records of Parliament's Constitutional Law Committee shows how the Government's use of delegated emergency powers raised particular concerns about inter‐institutional transparency during the state of emergency. These findings prompt an enquiry into whether delegated emergency powers and the related quest for centralized transparency‐led accountability produced a rupture in the theory of complex multicentric policymaking.
