3007,Psychological Flexibility of Nurses in a Cancer Hospital: Preliminary Validation of a Chinese Version of the Work-related Acceptance and Action Questionnaire,2018,"OBJECTIVE: To translate the English work-related acceptance and action questionnaire (WAAQ), make cross-cultural adaptations, and examine its psychometric properties when used by Chinese oncology nurses. METHODS: After translation, the psychometric properties of the Chinese WAAQ were analyzed among 417 nurses, and content validity was determined by six experts. RESULTS: Item-level content validity index (CVI) values were between 0.83 and 1.00; scale-level CVI/universal agreement (S-CVI/UA) and S-CVI/average were 0.86 and 0.98, respectively, which implicated a good content validity. The correlation of the Chinese WAAQ with AAQ-II (r(s) = −0.247, P < 0.001) suggested criterion validity, and those with General Health Questionnaire-12 (−0.250, <0.001) and general self-efficacy scale (0.491, <0.001) and Utrecht work engagement scale (UWES) (0.439, <0.001) suggested convergent validity. Exploratory factor analysis identified a seven-item, one-factor structure of WAAQ. The Chinese version of WAAQ had high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.920), with an item-total correlation coefficient of 0.702–0.828 (P < 0.05), split-half reliability of 0.933, and test-retest reliability of 0.772. CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese WAAQ is a reliable and valid tool for assessing psychological flexibility in Chinese oncology nurses.","Xu, Xianghua; Liu, Xiangyu; Ou, Meijun; Xie, Chanjuan; Chen, Yongyi",Asia Pac J Oncol Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5763445/,383
4274,Global mapping of randomised trials related articles published in high-impact-factor medical journals: a cross-sectional analysis,2020-01-07,"BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) provide the most reliable information to inform clinical practice and patient care. We aimed to map global clinical research publication activity through RCT-related articles in high-impact-factor medical journals over the past five decades. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of articles published in the highest ranked medical journals with an impact factor > 10 (according to Journal Citation Reports published in 2017). We searched PubMed/MEDLINE (from inception to December 31, 2017) for all RCT-related articles (e.g. primary RCTs, secondary analyses and methodology papers) published in high-impact-factor medical journals. For each included article, raw metadata were abstracted from the Web of Science. A process of standardization was conducted to unify the different terms and grammatical variants and to remove typographical, transcription and/or indexing errors. Descriptive analyses were conducted (including the number of articles, citations, most prolific authors, countries, journals, funding sources and keywords). Network analyses of collaborations between countries and co-words are presented. RESULTS: We included 39,305 articles (for the period 1965–2017) published in forty journals. The Lancet (n = 3593; 9.1%), the Journal of Clinical Oncology (n = 3343; 8.5%) and The New England Journal of Medicine (n = 3275 articles; 8.3%) published the largest number of RCTs. A total of 154 countries were involved in the production of articles. The global productivity ranking was led by the United States (n = 18,393 articles), followed by the United Kingdom (n = 8028 articles), Canada (n = 4548 articles) and Germany (n = 4415 articles). Seventeen authors who had published 100 or more articles were identified; the most prolific authors were affiliated with Duke University (United States), Harvard University (United States) and McMaster University (Canada). The main funding institutions were the National Institutes of Health (United States), Hoffmann-La Roche (Switzerland), Pfizer (United States), Merck Sharp & Dohme (United States) and Novartis (Switzerland). The 100 most cited RCTs were published in nine journals, led by The New England Journal of Medicine (n = 78 articles), The Lancet (n = 9 articles) and JAMA (n = 7 articles). These landmark contributions focused on novel methodological approaches (e.g. the “Bland-Altman method”) and trials on the management of chronic conditions (e.g. diabetes control, hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women, multiple therapies for diverse cancers, cardiovascular therapies such as lipid-lowering statins, antihypertensive medications, and antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis identified authors, countries, funding institutions, landmark contributions and high-impact-factor medical journals publishing RCTs. Over the last 50 years, publication production in leading medical journals has increased, with Western countries leading in research but with low- and middle-income countries showing very limited representation.","Catalá-López, Ferrán; Aleixandre-Benavent, Rafael; Caulley, Lisa; Hutton, Brian; Tabarés-Seisdedos, Rafael; Moher, David; Alonso-Arroyo, Adolfo",Trials,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6947860/,383
5369,"Irish Thoracic Society Annual Scientific Meeting 2017 10th - 11th November 2017, Limerick Strand Hotel, Limerick",2017-10-17,"The accumulation of [(3)H]noradrenaline ([(3)H]NA) and its oxidation products was studied in primary cultures of cerebral astrocytes. Astroglial accumulation of radiolabeled catecholamine ([(3)H] NA and oxidation products) was enhanced by manganese or iron, but it was inhibited by unlabeled NA, dopamine or ascorbate. Tissue:medium ratios of radioactivity increased as extracellular [(3)H]NA was oxidized. When extracellular oxidation was prevented by ascorbate, as confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, either ouabain pretreatment or nominally Na(+)-free incubation medium inhibited approximately one-half of specific [(3)H]NA accumulation by rat (but not mouse) astrocytes. These observations suggest that neurological responses to trace metals and ascorbate may arise from the effects of these agents on the clearance of extracellular catecholamines. Astrocytes can accumulate oxidation products of NA more rapidly than they take up NA itself, but ascorbate at physiological concentrations prevents the oxidation process in extracellular fluid. Furthermore, in the presence of ascorbate, Na(+)-dependent transport mediates a significant component of NA accumulation in rat astrocytes.","Wilson, John X.; Wilson, Greame A.

10603,Characteristics and prognosis of hospital‐treated obstructive bronchitis in children aged less than two years,2008-01-21,"Brome mosaic virus (BMV) is a representative member of positive-strand RNA viruses. The 1a replicase from BMV is a membrane protein of unknown structure with a methyltransferase N-terminal domain and a putative helicase activity in the C-terminal domain. In order to make a functional prediction of the helicase activity of the BMV 1a C-terminal domain, we have built a model of its structure. The use of fold recognition servers hinted at two different superfamilies of helicases [superfamily 1 (SF1) and superfamily 2 (SF2)] as putative templates for the C-terminal fragment of BMV 1a. A structural model of BMV 1a in SF2 was obtained by means of a fold recognition server (3D-PSSM). On the other hand, we used the helicase motifs described in the literature to construct a model of the structure of the BMV 1a C-terminal domain as a member of the SF1. The biological functionality and statistic potentials were used to discriminate between the two models. The results illustrate that the use of sequence profiles and patterns helps modeling. Accordingly, the C-terminal domain of BMV 1a is a potential member of the SF1 of helicases, and it can be modeled with the structure of a member of the UvrD family of helicases. The helicase mechanism was corroborated by the model and this supports the hypothesis that BMV 1a should have helicase activity.","Garriga, Damià; Dìez, Juana; Oliva, Baldomero",J Mol Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7187956/,383
10643,Retrospective Review of the Safety and Efficacy of Virtual Reality in a Pediatric Hospital,2020-04-10,"INTRODUCTION: Meaningful conversations about diagnostic errors require safety cultures where clinicians are comfortable discussing errors openly. However, clinician comfort discussing diagnostic errors publicly and barriers to these discussions remain unexplored. We compared clinicians’ comfort discussing diagnostic errors to other medical errors and identified barriers to open discussion. METHODS: Pediatric clinicians at 4 hospitals were surveyed between May and June 2018. The survey assessed respondents’ comfort discussing medical errors (with varying degrees of system versus individual clinician responsibility) during morbidity and mortality conferences and privately with peers. Respondents reported the most significant barriers to discussing diagnostic errors publicly. Poststratification weighting accounted for nonresponse bias; the Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment was applied to control for false discovery (significance set at P < 0.018). RESULTS: Clinicians (n = 838; response rate 22.6%) were significantly less comfortable discussing all error types during morbidity and mortality conferences than privately (P < 0.004) and significantly less comfortable discussing diagnostic errors compared with other medical errors (P < 0.018). Comfort did not differ by clinician type or years in practice; clinicians at one institution were significantly less comfortable discussing diagnostic errors compared with peers at other institutions. The most frequently cited barriers to discussing diagnostic errors publicly included feeling like a bad clinician, loss of reputation, and peer judgment of knowledge base and decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians are more uncomfortable discussing diagnostic errors than other types of medical errors. The most frequent barriers involve the public perception of clinical performance. Addressing this aspect of safety culture may improve clinician participation in efforts to reduce harm from diagnostic errors.","Grubenhoff, Joseph A.; Ziniel, Sonja I.; Cifra, Christina L.; Singhal, Geeta; McClead, Richard E.; Singh, Hardeep",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190246/,383
10652,A Quality Improvement Intervention Bundle to Reduce 30-Day Pediatric Readmissions,2020-02-28,"INTRODUCTION: Handoffs and transitions of care are common weak points in healthcare provider communication as patients move between sites. With no consistent pattern of communication between St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (St. Jude) and its affiliated clinics, the Affiliate Program Office at St. Jude developed and implemented a standardized communication tool to facilitate patient transitions between different healthcare sites. METHODS: Each team of providers created flow diagrams to define the current state of communication when patients were transitioning between remote sites. Fishbone diagrams identified the common barriers to effective communication as a lack of consistent communication and ownership. We developed a communication tool to address these barriers, which was disseminated by secure email. We measured the percent usage of the completed hand-off tool before a patient transitioned, staff experience, and the number of errors. RESULTS: The time to send or receive the communication bundle was <10 minutes. Within 3 months of implementing the SMART bundle at 3 pilot sites, the bundle was used completely in 6 of 8 patient transitions and was associated with somewhat improved staff satisfaction. We identified no adverse events related to the communication bundle. CONCLUSIONS: In this small pilot study, we accomplished closed-loop communication between geographically remote healthcare sites by using an electronically transmitted standardized communication bundle.","Helmig, Sara; Cox, Jennifer; Mehta, Brinda; Burlison, Jonathan; Morgan, Jennifer; Russo, Carolyn",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190255/,383
11559,What’s Important: Hoping to Help: An Orthopaedic Perspective,2020-04-22,"BACKGROUND: Lung ultrasound is a bedside non-irradiating tool for assessment and monitoring of lung diseases. A lung ultrasound score based on visualized artefacts allows reliable quantification of lung aeration, and is useful to monitor mechanical ventilation setting, fluid resuscitation and antibiotic response in critical care. In the context of interstitial lung diseases associated to connective tissue disorders, lung ultrasound has been integrated to computed tomography for diagnosis and follow-up monitoring of chronic lung disease progression. CASE PRESENTATION: This case describes a severe acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease associated to dermatomyositis–polymyositis requiring prolonged extra-corporeal life support. Lung ultrasound score was performed daily and allowed monitoring and guiding both the need of advanced imaging as computed tomography and immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests lung ultrasound may be a useful monitoring tool for the response to immunosuppressive therapy in acute severe rheumatic interstitial lung disease, where chest X-ray is poorly informative, and transportation is at high risk.","Mongodi, Silvia; Colombo, Andrea; Orlando, Anita; Cavagna, Lorenzo; Bouhemad, Bélaid; Iotti, Giorgio Antonio; Mojoli, Francesco",Ultrasound J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224726/,383

11790,Secretive and close? How sharing secrets may impact perceptions of distance,2020-06-11,"The West Africa Ebola outbreak was the largest outbreak ever recorded, with over 28,000 reported infections; this devastating epidemic emphasized the need to understand the mechanisms to counteract virus infection. Here, we screen a library of nearly 400 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) against a biologically contained Ebola virus and identify several ISGs not previously known to affect Ebola virus infection. Overexpression of the top ten ISGs attenuates virus titers by up to 1000-fold. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that three ISGs interfere with virus entry, six affect viral transcription/replication, and two inhibit virion formation and budding. A comprehensive study of one ISG (CCDC92) that shows anti-Ebola activity in our screen reveals that CCDC92 can inhibit viral transcription and the formation of complete virions via an interaction with the viral protein NP. Our findings provide insights into Ebola virus infection that could be exploited for the development of therapeutics against this virus.","Kuroda, Makoto; Halfmann, Peter J.; Hill-Batorski, Lindsay; Ozawa, Makoto; Lopes, Tiago J.

13913,Erratum: Modeling psychiatric disorders: from genomic findings to cellular phenotypes,2016-06-21,"While horizontal gene transfer is prevalent across the biosphere, the regulatory features that enable expression and functionalization of foreign DNA remain poorly understood. Here, we combine high-throughput promoter activity measurements and large-scale genomic analysis of regulatory regions to investigate the cross-compatibility of regulatory elements (REs) in bacteria. Functional characterization of thousands of natural REs in three distinct bacterial species revealed distinct expression patterns according to RE and recipient phylogeny. Host capacity to activate foreign promoters was proportional to their genomic GC content, while many low GC regulatory elements were both broadly active and had more transcription start sites across hosts. The difference in expression capabilities could be explained by the influence of the host GC content on the stringency of the AT-rich canonical σ70 motif necessary for transcription initiation. We further confirm the generalizability of this model and find widespread GC content adaptation of the σ70 motif in a set of 1,545 genomes from all major bacterial phyla. Our analysis identifies a key mechanism by which the strength of the AT-rich σ70 motif relative to a host’s genomic GC content governs the capacity for expression of acquired DNA. These findings shed light on regulatory adaptation in the context of evolving genomic composition.","Gomes, Antonio L.

16919,IL-33 in Mental Disorders,2021-03-26,"BACKGROUND: Risk factors that predispose the development of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) among pediatric CAP patients of different age ranges are yet to be identified. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed pediatric in-patients (< 6 years old) diagnosed with CAP in our hospital. We subdivided patients into four age groups (< 6 months, 6 months-1 year, 1–2 years, and 2–6 years). Their medical records, including demographic information, clinical features, laboratory findings, and chest radiographic reports, were reviewed and collected for further analysis. Univariate logistic regression analysis and stepwise regression analysis were applied to identify risk factors associated with severe CAP and ICU admission for overall patients and age-stratified subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 20,174 cases were initially included. Among them, 3309 (16.40%) cases were identified as severe CAP, and 2824 (14.00%) cases required ICU admission. Potential risk factors for severe CAP and ICU admission identified by univariate analysis included younger age, rural residency, premature birth, low birth weight (LBW), formula feeding, congenital heart disease (CHD), history of pneumonia or neonatal jaundice, patients with other health issues, certain symptoms (manifesting wheezing, dyspnea, cyanosis, but have no cough or fever), abnormal laboratory findings (abnormal levels of white blood cells, albumin, and C-reactive protein and RSV infection), and chest X-ray (odds ratio [OR] > 1 for all). CHD, low albumin, proteinuria, abnormal chest x-ray were independent risks factors across different age groups, whereas birth or feeding history, history of pneumonia, cyanosis or dyspnea on admission, and RSV infection were independent risk factors for only younger kids (< 1 year), and wheezing was an independent risk factor only for older children (2–5 years old). CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors predicting disease severity among children hospitalized with CAP vary with age. Risk factor stratification of pediatric CAP based on age-specific risk factors can better guide clinical practice.

The pathogen has developed resistance to every antibiotic currently approved for treatment, and multidrug-resistant strains have been identified globally. The current treatment recommended by the World Health Organization is ceftriaxone and azithromycin dual therapy. However, resistance to azithromycin and ceftriaxone are increasing and treatment failures have been reported. As a result, there is a critical need to develop novel strategies for mitigating the spread of antimicrobial-resistant N. gonorrhoeae through improved diagnosis and treatment of resistant infections. Strategies that are currently being pursued include developing molecular assays to predict resistance, utilizing higher doses of ceftriaxone, repurposing older antibiotics, and developing newer agents. In addition, efforts to discover a vaccine for N. gonorrhoeae have been reignited in recent years with the cross-protectivity provided by the N. meningitidis vaccine, with several new strategies and targets. Despite the significant progress that has been made, there is still much work ahead to combat antimicrobial-resistant N. gonorrhoeae globally.","Lin, Eric Y; Adamson, Paul C; Klausner, Jeffrey D.",Drugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182353/,383

This study aimed to compare a new robotic spine platform from Fusion Robotics(TM )(Fusion Robotics, Helena, MT) with the widely used Mazor-X(TM) Stealth Edition robotic platform (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) in terms of workflow and lumbar pedicle screw placement accuracy. Methods A cadaver lab was conducted, which included four procedures with single-level lumbar pedicle screw placement using the Fusion Robotics(TM) system. These four procedures were compared to four propensity-score matched cases with single-level lumbar pedicle screw placement using the Mazor-X(TM) Stealth Edition. A single surgeon performed all surgeries. The cases were matched in terms of demographics (age, sex, race, BMI) and comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index score). The primary outcome measure was the operative workflow efficiency (duration as measured with a stopwatch by an independent observer). The secondary outcome measures were pedicle screw accuracy and accuracy to plan. Results After propensity-score matching, there were four cases in each group with no significant between-group differences in terms of sex, race, BMI, or surgical levels; however, there were significant differences in terms of age (p=0.01) and comorbidities (p<0.001). The workflow efficiency measurement showed that the Fusion Robotics(TM) platform had a significantly shorter duration in terms of the system set-up time, planning to in-position time, and total procedure time (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the robotic platforms in terms of creating a sterile barrier, scanning and importing images, creating a plan, screw placement, screw accuracy, and screw accuracy to plan. Conclusion Based on our findings, the Fusion Robotics(TM) platform had a significantly shorter procedure workflow duration while maintaining the same accuracy as the most commonly used robotic platform (Mazor-X(TM)). This is the first study to directly compare different spine surgery robotic systems.","Soliman, Mohamed A; Khan, Asham; O'Connor, Timothy E; Foley, Kevin; Pollina, John",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8236238/,383

Thus, there is an urgent need to develop measures intended to enhance diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic capabilities and capacities to improve the ability of society to combat infectious diseases outbreaks, as well as to alleviate the effects of bioterrorism attacks. We present here two examples of biotechnology usage for biodefence purposes: (i) plants as biofactories for the rapid production of improved biopharmaceuticals (‘Plant Molecular Farming’), and (ii) plant sequences as immune-modulating agents to enhance the efficacy of genetic vaccines.

The basic concept of ST concerns about two combined dimensions of analyzing: time and space. For prediction of disease outbreak, we attempt to locate any potential uninfected by the predicted virus prevalence. A popular ST-clustering software called “SaTScan” works by predicting the next likely infested areas by considering the history records of infested zones and the radius of the zone. However, it is argued that using radius as a spatial measure suits large and perhaps evenly populated area. In urban city, the population density is relatively high and uneven. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, by following the concept of SaTScan, but in consideration of spatial information in relation to local populations and full demographic information in proximity (e.g. that of a street or a cluster of buildings). This higher resolution of ST data mining has an advantage of precision and applicability in some very compact urban cities.

41722,EP07 Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis: diagnostic and therapeutic challenges during COVID-19 pandemic,2020-11-03,"BACKGROUND: Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a potent host antiviral effector protein that blocks the invasion of various viruses, including the influenza A virus (IAV). The C allele of the rs12252 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) shows vulnerability to the pandemic 2009 H1N1 IAV in European and Asian populations. OBJECTIVE: Here, we estimated the disease susceptibility of the rs12252 SNP with the pandemic 2009 H1N1 IAV infection in the Korean population. RESULTS: We carried out direct sequencing of the IFITM3 gene and compared the genotype and allele frequencies of the rs12252 SNP of the IFITM3 gene in healthy Koreans and pandemic 2009 H1N1 IAV-infected patients. Notably, we observed that healthy individuals had a similar genotype distribution of the rs12252 SNP (P = 0.140) as patients. The dominant model and recessive model did not find a statistically significant difference in genotype distribution between healthy individuals and patients. In addition, the allele distribution of the rs12252 SNP of in healthy individuals and patients also showed a similar genetic distribution (P = 0.757). However, the genetic distribution of rs12252 SNP in merged patient group (Koreans and Chinese populations) showed significant association with susceptibility of pandemic 2009 IAV (P = 0.0393). CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this was the first evaluation of the susceptibility of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 IAV in the Korean population.","Kim, Yong-Chan; Jeong, Min-Ju; Jeong, Byung-Hoon",Mol Cell Toxicol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7640581/,383

43495,COVID‐19: not just an acute illness,2020-11-26,"Having an experienced and trained healthcare workforce available during public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, is critical. While all healthcare workers are at risk of contracting COVID-19, older workers are at increased risk of serious or fatal illness. This investigation explores the front-line experiences and perspectives of registered nurses (RNs) at a major New York City medical center during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on two age cohorts: older (50+) and younger (20-49) RNs. An anonymous internet-based survey was sent to all RN’s employed at the center. Data collection was initiated in May 2020, following the initial surge in NYC’s COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths; 1,483 surveys were completed. This investigation found that in comparison to younger RNs (n=1,067), older RNs’ (n=416) psychosocial well-being was significantly better -- fewer depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms (p<.001). They were less stressed caring for COVID-19 patients (p <.001) and less worried about work-related exposure risk (p<.001). They also reported higher job satisfaction (p<.001), less work-home stress (p<.001), a higher commitment to choosing the nursing profession (p<.001), were more confident in the profession (p<.001) and to meeting its’ expectations (p<.001). Overall, although older RNs represent a smaller proportion of the nursing workforce, their collective expertise and clinical experience in healthcare delivery are significant. The older RN workforce is a seasoned resource to draw upon during public health emergencies and a valuable role model for younger RNs, particularly given their continued adherence to nursing, during this COVID-19 time of uncertainty and personal health risk.","Raveis, Victoria; VanDevanter, Nancy; Kovner, Christine; Yu, Gary; Ridge, Laura Jean; Glassman, Kimberly",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7740894/,383

52374,Modeling COVID 19: The Value of Practice,2021-05-03,"INTRODUCTION: Appendicitis management has evolved recently with more reliance on Computed Topography (CT) and laparoscopic surgery being commonplace. In this project we looked at how the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) had impacted the diagnosis, management and outcomes of patients with appendicitis in our unit. METHOD: A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with appendicitis from 1st March – 30th April in 2019 and 2020. Data was collected on diagnosis, management and outcomes. RESULTS: In 2020, 91 patients were identified (mean 33, range 6-85, F:M 1:1.4). In 2019, 107 patients were identified (mean 32, range 7-69, M:F 1:1.1). There was no significant difference in patients’ symptom duration (p = 0.21), White Cell Count (p = 0.20) or C-Reactive Protein (p = 0.10). More CTs were performed in 2020 (56/91, 61.5%) than in 2019 (40/107, 37.4%). Less patients underwent appendicectomy in 2020 (75/91, 82.4%) than in 2019 (104/107, 97.2%). Open appendicectomies were performed in 64% (48/75) of those operated in 2020 compared with 12.2% (13/104) in 2019. There was no difference in hospital length of stay or re-admissions rates. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis and management of appendicitis changed considerably at our trust during COVID-19 with more reliance on CT diagnosis and less use of laparoscopy. Despite this, outcomes remained unchanged.","Idama, Daniel; Aldersley, George; Connolly, Meghan; O'Connor, Alexander; Idama, Daniel",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083531/,383
52402,Endocrine Dysfunction in Covid-19,2021-05-03,"INTRODUCTION: Burn camps have served burn-injured youth in the U.S. for over 35 years. Camp is a rehabilitation program that has been recognized as an important part of young survivors’ recovery. The 2020 global pandemic made an in-person camp impossible, so volunteers rallied to provide a virtual experience. Registered campers received a “Camp in a Box” filled with activities, art supplies, a camp tee-shirt, and snacks to enjoy at Virtual Burn Camp (VBC). Participants connected with campers and counselors online. This study sought to determine how youth viewed VBC compared to in-person camp, how the pandemic was affecting their emotional status and whether VBC helped them. METHODS: The study asked participants to rate survey items regarding levels of comfort, connection, and support at VBC vs. in-person camp on a 4-point scale from 1. NO! 2. no 3. yes 4. YES! Multiple choice questions such as My favorite thing about virtual camp, and “Things I missed most about regular burn camp” - choose 2. General stress & anxiety levels related to Covid-19 were assessed, as well as if VBC helped to reduce their anxiety/stress levels. RESULTS: Pediatric burn survivors (n=77) participating in 2 virtual camps, demographic’s included mean age 13.8 years, male (n=39%), female (n=61%), visible scars (74%) vs. (10%) hidden scars with the majority representing racial/ethnic minorities (65%) vs. white (35%). Campers reported feeling more connected at in-person camp (84%) vs. VBC (38%). Feeling supported was higher at regular burn camp (84%), but the majority (76%) also claimed feeling supported at VBC. Camper’s favorite things about VBC were Camp in a Box (66%), Being Part of the Burn Community (51%), and Seeing Counselors (47%). Things missed most about regular burn camp were seeing Friends (83%) and Counselors (61%). Respondents reported high Covid-19 related stress/anxiety levels (66%) and (88%) said that VBC reduced their anxiety/stress. Top benefits included feeling Happy (48%) and Thankful (32%). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric burn survivors place a high value on their burn community involvement. Though not the preferred camp method, the VBC earned high marks for camper’s improved emotional status and for reducing their Covid-19 stress and anxiety levels. The program succeeded in helping Virtual Campers feel supported and provided an important venue for connecting them with their burn-injured peers and camp counselors.","Brubaker, Ruth B; Bay, Curt; Chacon, Daniel W; Carson, Madeleine; Cahill, Jade A; Foster, Kevin N",J Burn Care Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083710/,383

OBJECTIVES: Which measures are recommended for effective prevention of bacterial and viral diseases relevant to obstetrics? MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature search on hygiene measures in terms of preventing transmission of infection. RESULTS: The physiological vaginal flora of the pregnant woman is a fundamental factor in natural defence against infection. Its disruption—also through antimicrobial therapies—has a proven influence on the course of pregnancy (premature rupture of membranes, premature birth). It also leads to a disturbed intestinal microbiome in newborns, which has long-term consequences for their neurological, respiratory, metabolic and immunological development and increases mortality. The focus should therefore be on prevention—rather than therapy—of infectious diseases during pregnancy. This requires a detailed anamnesis, monitoring and updating of the vaccination status and, if necessary, clarification of the infection status by means of targeted serological tests. Then the gynecologist can give individual advice on preventive measures. This article provides specific recommendations on selected obstetrically relevant infections. CONCLUSIONS: Focusing on hygiene measures to prevent infection in obstetrics can improve the health of both mother and child.","Niederle, Bernhard",Gynakologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8103136/,383
53093,The Impact of Diabetes and African American Race in COVID-19 Severity,2021-05-03,"The Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR) of ambient vibration measurements is a common tool to explore near surface shear wave velocity (Vs) structure. HVSR is often applied for earthquake risk assessments and civil engineering projects. Ambient vibration signal originates from the combination of a multitude of natural and man-made sources. Ambient vibration sources can be any ground motion inducing phenomena, e.g., ocean waves, wind, industrial activity or road traffic, where each source does not need to be strictly stationary even during short times. Typically, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to obtain spectral information from the measured time series in order to estimate the HVSR, even though possible non-stationarity may bias the spectra and HVSR estimates. This problem can be alleviated by employing the Hilbert–Huang Transform (HHT) instead of FFT. Comparing 1D inversion results for FFT and HHT-based HVSR estimates from data measured at a well studied, urban, permanent station, we find that HHT-based inversion models may yield a lower data misfit [Formula: see text] by up to a factor of 25, a more appropriate Vs model according to available well-log lithology, and higher confidence in the achieved model.","Neukirch, Maik; García-Jerez, Antonio; Villaseñor, Antonio; Luzón, Francisco; Ruiz, Mario; Molina, Luis",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8126136/,383
53106,Telehealth for Endocrinology: Effect on Utilization in Non-Pandemic Care,2021-05-03,"Digital technologies automating marketing and sales activities are rapidly spreading. The adoption of Sales & Marketing Automation (S&MA) systems allows companies to improve their marketing campaigns, track their customers’ journey and generate real-time insights to respond to customers more efficiently and effectively. The Covid-19 pandemic has further increased the importance of S&MA as customers have massively shifted towards digital channels to interact with businesses and purchase products and services. In this paper, we investigate how S&MA generates value for companies in the post-Covid-19 scenario, adopting the perspective of the buyer organization. Based on insights generated through a qualitative and quantitative research, we propose a conceptual model explaining the value drivers of S&MA in terms of benefits and sacrifices. Our research highlights that a mere focus on the technological side of these platforms limits the assessment of value generation as it is crucial to also consider customer-centric, operational and integration-based value drivers. By segmenting the S&MA value perceptions of different companies, this research also provides guidelines to develop, promote and implement S&MA solutions for buyers and vendors operating in B2B.","Corsaro, Daniela; Maggioni, Isabella; Olivieri, Mirko",Ital,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8127447/,383

In 2020, in-person Extension programs were cancelled or converted to online versions. This was the case for the ‘Alfalfa in the South’ (AITS) program, a collaboration between Auburn University (AU) and University of Georgia (UGA). Two online AITS programs were held (May and Sept) and are examples of rethinking traditional models and optimizing resources to prioritize our commitment to clientele. In its first program, the program content was delivered through 1) a series of webinars from AU, UGA and University of Florida (UF) Extension Specialists (n = 6 webinars) and a 1-h live roundtable discussion held through Zoom on May 13, 2020. The roundtable consisted of a moderator interacting with five panelists (faculty, Extension agents and producers) answering live questions from the audience (n = 45 participants). All content was archived by the Alabama Cooperative Extension System (ACES) for later access using online resources. The second program occurred in Sept 2020 as a collaboration between AU, UF and UGA Specialists. This program included several pre-recorded short videos and e-publications on topics in establishment and management of alfalfa in the South. In 2020, the web-metrics gathered for the ACES webpage and Youtube channel across these programs sums over 3000 views of alfalfa resources. Similarly, engagement on the AL Beef and Forage Extension Facebook pages were over 3000 people. Although a traditional formal post-programming survey was not conducted with participants, an online survey was distributed simultaneously in the south region (n = 12 states) from May through December 2020 aiming to identify main challenges and limitations of alfalfa adoption. The results (n = 212 respondents) showed approximately 65% participants already invested time in learning about alfalfa using Extension online programs and resources available. This shows increased importance of online outreach as a tool to maintain relevance and connection with clientele.","da Silva, Liliane Severino; Mullenix, Kim K; Dillard, S Leanne L; Tucker, Jennifer J; Thompson, Gerry",J Anim Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8104729/,383
53241,904 Can Patients with Acute Appendicitis be Ambulated Safely?,2021-05-04,"Introduction: Lung neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a common cause of ectopic ACTH-secretion. Only 3% of NETs cause Cushing’s syndrome(1); the majority are small and may be radiographically occult. Additionally, the responses to dexamethasone, metyrapone, and oCRF can be indistinguishable from that observed in pituitary Cushing’s disease(2). These challenges lead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary procedures. Case Description: 45-year-old male presented for resection of right-sided pulmonary carcinoid tumor. He was diagnosed with Cushing’s syndrome in 2011 when he experienced uncontrolled hypertension and excessive weight gain with elevations in cortisol and ACTH levels. He underwent transsphenoidal pituitary resection in May 2011 for a possible pituitary microadenoma. Post-operative worsening hypertension, weight gain, and striae led to bilateral adrenalectomy in November 2011, complicated by retroperitoneal hemorrhage and resuscitation-induced pulmonary edema. On chest CT in early 2012, an 8 mm incidental right pulmonary nodule was documented. 8 years later, chest imaging for mild COVID-19 infection again revealed a right-sided pulmonary nodule. He underwent CT-guided biopsy of the nodule in July 2020 with pathology demonstrating carcinoid histology. Right lower lobectomy was performed. Pre-operative ACTH was 1673 pg/mL (normal: 10-60 pg/mL) and post-operative ACTH was 16 pg/mL. The resected tumor stained positive for ACTH, confirming that carcinoid tumor was the source of Cushing’s for the past decade. Conclusion: The diagnosis of ectopic Cushing’s syndrome can be elusive, leading to surgeries with significant morbidity, as seen in our patient. In one retrospective review, 14% of patients with Cushing’s had transsphenoidal resection before they were diagnosed with an ectopic source(3). Ectopic Cushing’s syndrome can be a challenging diagnosis to make and a multidisciplinary approach with close collaboration between endocrinologist, radiologist, surgeon and pathologist may increase the diagnosis accuracy.

53256,28 Shifting to Virtual MDT in the COVID-19 Era and Beyond,2021-05-04,"Telehealth (TH) usage increased exponentially with the COVID-19 pandemic, aided by more permissive policies. Prior to the pandemic, policy makers and payers expressed concern that telehealth might lead to over-utilization of services. This contributed to a limited reimbursement environment. To assess evidence for this concern, we studied real-world TH at an academic medical center and hypothesized that TH would not increase utilization. We compared pre-pandemic utilization in a retrospective cohort of adult endocrinology patients with either TH (synchronous audio-visual visits) or conventional visits (CV) between 11/1/2017 - 3/16/2020. We focused on a pre-pandemic cohort to reflect usual practice. TH patients (i.e., 1+ TH visit with endocrinology in the study period) were identified using billing modifiers in EHR-derived data. CV patients were matched for provider and primary diagnosis, then selected from EHR-derived data in a 1:3 ratio. A minority of providers were performing TH visits pre-pandemic. Matching was performed to eliminate confounding from individual practice variation and to assure ability to compare patients with similar diagnoses. The majority of TH encounters in our practice during the study were clinic-to-clinic, with patients at a TH-enabled remote clinic. 75 TH and 225 CV patients were identified. 77% (55) of TH and 72% (163) of CV patients were female. The mean age was 45.2 (SD 12.4) and 49.6 (SD 16.7) years, respectively. Among TH patients, 68% (51) were white and 12% (9) were black with no statistically significant demographic differences between groups. The most common TH primary diagnoses were DM (33 patients) and thyroid disease (33 patients). Other TH diagnoses included pituitary/adrenal conditions, hyperparathyroidism, PCOS, and hypogonadism. TH patients had median follow-up of 21 months (IQR 13-25) and CV patients 18 months (IQR 11-25), p=0.613. TH patients had a range of 1 to 9 TH encounters during this time (median 2, IQR 1-3). Median TH visits per month were 0.20 (IQR 0.11-0.3). Looking at all endocrine encounters, TH patients had a median of 0.24 (IQR 0.015-0.36) encounters per month. CV patients had median of 0.20 encounters per month (IQR 0.11-0.37). Total encounters per month did not vary significantly between groups (p=0.0512, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Patients with primary thyroid diagnoses had similar frequencies of TSH testing with TH median 4 tests (IQR 2-7); CV median 3 tests (IQR 1-5), p=0.057. A1c testing frequency was similar in patients with primary diagnosis of DM. TH patients had median 2 tests (IQR 1-3.5); CV median 3 (IQR 1-5), p=0.8012. In conclusion, TH was not associated with higher utilization of visits or lab testing in a small study of a pre-pandemic telehealth program. Coupled with larger scale and replicative studies, these findings might inform policy making and support continuation of telehealth in the post-pandemic environment.","Williams, Alexander; Walsh, Colin; Griffith, Michelle",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135395/,383
53280,572 Virtual Reality Operative Simulation in Orthopaedic Surgical Training During Periods of Restricted Clinical Hours: Systematic Review,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims Medical students need to gain patient contact to develop their skills in history taking and examinations. In year three, undergraduate students typically rotate across various hospitals and specialties and are expected to have dedicated rheumatology exposure for history and examination competencies. Rheumatology as an out-patient specialty can limit opportunities for medical students to have broad exposure to rheumatological conditions. Methods In January 2018, we designed an annual rheumatology half-day teaching workshop (‘Rheumatology Carousel’) using a combination of lecture-based teaching and small group based guided clinical history and examination stations, aimed at third-year medical students from the University of Birmingham. This covered key presentations in rheumatology: axial spondyloarthropathy, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis (connective tissue disease), osteoarthritis, and vasculitis. Each station required a Clinical Teaching Fellow or Rheumatology ST trainee, overseen by one consultant facilitator. We designed patient proforma’s incorporating consent, demographics, key clinical history, therapy, and examination findings. We produced a written patient guide, and consultants invited appropriate patients to volunteer for the day. We designed a one-hour lecture-based tutorial. A lesson plan and schedule were created outlining faculty requirements; including time, roles, and faculty numbers. We invited five to six patients to each session, with a plan of four to five focussed examinations. We designed the carousel to accommodate up to 40 students, split into two groups running over a day. Focussed examinations involved students in groups of four, with each student being a lead examiner in at least one station, each station lasting 20 minutes. Best practice examination techniques for each condition were assessed and emphasised. Following a debrief, we collected feedback from students, faculty, and patients (online and written feedback), using Likert scores for teaching content, and quality of the session delivery. Results The carousel ran in February 2018, 19, and 20. The sessions were positively evaluated by students, faculty, and patients. In total, 93 students attended, 89/93 completed feedback. Satisfaction scores (mean; SD; range) were high (1-strongly disagree, 5-strongly agree) for content (4.8; 0.49, range 3-5) and quality of delivery (4.7; 0.54; 3-5). All patients who participated volunteered to return for future teaching sessions, with several patients attending all three years. Free text feedback indicated students valued structured exposure to core conditions and called for more sessions of this nature. Conclusion This sustainable reproducible intervention ensures students have structured exposure to important rheumatological conditions. The methodology allows reproducible sessions that are positively evaluated despite rotating clinical teaching staff. We have made all our teaching materials, logistical plan, and scheduling tools available as open access resources under a Creative Commons license for free re-use and adaptation by any healthcare professional, via a web link. We plan to record an electronic version to distribute post the COVID-19 pandemic. Disclosure P. Mistry: None. J. Bateman: None. H. Foss: None. M.

53349,782 A Rare Complication in A Post-Operative Bariatric Patient: COVID-19 Induced Mesenteric Venous Thrombosis,2021-05-04,"INTRODUCTION: Covid-19 has changed surgical practice. Infection risk and hospital pressures means appropriate patient ambulation is paramount. Uncomplicated diverticulitis can be managed as an outpatient. Clinical differentiation of uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis remains challenging. This study aims to develop a diagnostic algorithm to differentiate complicated from uncomplicated disease prior to imaging. METHOD: A single-centre retrospective review of 177 patients referred as diverticulitis between Sept-Dec 2018, was performed. Data collected included clinical presentation, biochemistry and imaging. Complicated diverticulitis was defined as occlusion, perforation, abscess formation, fistula and/or bleeding. Inferential parametric analysis was performed to ensure predictive value. RESULTS: Of 177 patients referred, 71 received a consultant diagnosis of diverticulitis. 60 were confirmed and differentiated on CT scan. LIF/lower abdominal pain (P < 0.01) and bowel habit change (P < 0.05) was significantly higher in patients with diverticulitis compared to other pathology. In complicated diverticulitis, symptoms occurred < 4days (P < 0.05), fever was present (P < 0.001) and CRP was > 75. CONCLUSIONS: Once diverticulitis diagnosis is made based on pain localisation and change in bowel habit, complicated disease can be predicted by symptom duration (< 4 days), presence of fever and a CRP > 75. Plans to assess these findings prospectively in a Surgical Admissions Unit are currently in development.","Kerr, B; Ahmed, O; Byrnes, C",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135689/,383
53989,Genetically Predicted Serum Vitamin D and COVID-19: A Mendelian Randomization Study,2021-06-07,"There is a pressing need to equip youth-serving community organizations to respond to the unique needs of trauma-exposed children. Early prevention measures can be an effective means of redirecting children to self-regulatory healing, while facilitating their transition toward strength-based thriving. Sport can offer a powerful opportunity to reach these children; however there remains little information on how to effectively develop, deliver, evaluate, and sustain trauma-sensitive sport programs in a community context. The purpose of this paper is to outline a case study of integrating sport-based trauma-sensitive practices with BGC Canada’s national Bounce Back League program. An interdisciplinary partnership of academic, community, and practice experts used a community-based participatory action research approach, paired with a knowledge translational approach, to guide the process of program development. Mixed methods (e.g., surveys, logbooks, interviews, focus groups, online communications) were used to generate ongoing insights of staff’s training experiences, successes and challenges of program implementation, and potential impact of program on club members. Several stages of program development are described, including: (a) collaboratively planning the program; (b) piloting the program to three clubs; (c) adapting the program using pilot insights; (d) expanding the adapted program to ten clubs; and (e) creating opportunities to maintain, sustain, and scale-out practices throughout grant duration and beyond. Lessons learned regarding the leadership team’s experiences in terms of developing, adapting, and integrating trauma-sensitive practices in this community context are shared.

In this study, we aimed to assess the validity, reliability, and survival outcomes of simple chest computed tomography (CT) score in the evaluation of the severity of lung involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared with the current chest CT score. RESULTS: This retrospective analysis included 213 patients (121 men and 92 women; mean age, 46 ± 15.6 years; range, 1–85 years). The ROC curve was used to compare the validity of both scores. Interreader agreement (IRA) for both scores was calculated using Cohen’s kappa statistic. The survival analysis of both scores was investigated using the Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. The simple score showed a comparable validity with the current score (AUC = 0.89 and 0.90, respectively; p = 0.61). The ROC analysis demonstrated that a simple score of > 3 and a current score of > 12 were potential predictors of death with sensitivity values of 81.8% and 86.4% and specificity values of 96.3% and 93.7%, respectively. The simple score showed a higher IRA compared with the current score (κ = 0.645 and 0.458, respectively). Both scores were comparable for predicting survival outcomes. CONCLUSION: The simple score was non-inferior for predicting survival outcome, compared with the current chest CT score. Furthermore, we suggest that the simple score should be used as it is simpler and more consistent.","Abdel-Tawab, Mohamed; Basha, Mohammad Abd Alkhalik; Mohamed, Ibrahim A.

55185,Lessons from an unparalleled disruption to cancer prevention and control,2021-06-30,"During the current Covid‐19 pandemic, college laboratories are shut down and undergraduate students who need research experience are having a hard time gaining those skills. Against this backdrop we developed a pilot project that would introduce students to internationally available online biochemical databases, open‐source modeling software and animation tools. The students received individual hands‐on training to generate data allowing them to engage in discovery and contextualize learning as they would in a face‐to face laboratory setting. We describe an investigation of NMR‐based structures of a SARS coronavirus E channel protein, structures found in the 5X29 pdb file deposited by Surya, Li, &, Torres, and described in (2018) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1860: 1309‐1317. These small proteins form ion channels that are of interest because live attenuated vaccines target these channels promising prevention and treatment for coronavirus infections. The SARS coronavirus E channel protein, a right‐handed alpha‐helical bundle, is composed of 5 chains, A through E. Each chain has 16 NMR structures in the database. Incorporating computational and molecular visualization tools students generate data to observe, measure, and communicate the dihedral angle backbone movement of the whole pentamer, the separate chains, and individual amino acid residues on a bond‐by‐bond basis. All the open access software and programs used worked within a Windows/Mac environment except one program that used Linux command lines to create models from the PDB file. Afterwards these models were animated to demonstrate and analyze dihedral angle movement within structures. The students used this work to fulfill the laboratory component of their undergraduate independent study program at in the Biological Sciences and Chemistry Departments of Lehman College, a 4‐year college within the CUNY system.","Philipp, Manfred; Olumuyide, Ezekiel; Babalola, Blessing; Gonzalez, Janet",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239525/,383
56547,App based monitoring of heart rate via FibriCheck to facilitate teleconsultations: from COVID-19 to clinical practice?,2021-07-29,"5G and Beyond 5G networks (B5G) face the greatest obstacle to ensure accessibility with all categories of users. A significant part of the emerging wireless networks will greatly facilitate connectivity, and cooperation in high-speed communications from Unmanned Aviation Vehicles (UAVs) is expected. UAV has excellent features such as versatile delivery, simple line of sight (LOS) connecting, gradual independence and connectivity architecture speeds, and fixed framework communication systems. Given that many UAVs can achieve specific coverage for surface user terminals (UTs), one problem is how they can be implemented optimally. According to critical constraints, the implementation task was shaped as minimization, including the numbers of UAVs and the optimization of their network load: UAV should form a secure network structure and sustain links with the specified base stations (BSs). The challenge has been split into subtasks to address this problem of optimization with a core framework. The Unified Greedy Quest Algorithm for the Internet of Medical Things (UGQA-IoMT) algorithm is used for telemedicine applications and achieves a minimum number of UAVs and optimal places. The algorithm proposed refers to various scenarios in which UAVs are installed by themselves or with the set BSs, irrespective of the UT deployment. The performance gains in mean SNR of −3 dB, network load stability ratio of 99.89%, and coverage ratio of 97.5% are validated in coherent simulations of the proposed methodology for the real-time implementation.","Ghazal, Taher M.",Arab J Sci Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8331999/,383

However, its actual standing can be assessed in times of crises when farms have to overcome particular challenges. We use a large-scale farming sectors dataset FADN spanning 2006–2015 in which two major economic crises occurred—the global economic crisis of 2008 and the Russian embargo of 2014—to exemplify our approach to resilience’s assessment based on the Polish farming sectors. We introduce a distinction between “potential resilience” versus “revealed resilience” where the former is assessed based on resilience capacities (robustness, adaptability and transformability), while the latter is assessed based on the observed decomposition of total factor productivity (TFP) changes in response to the adverse economic shocks. Hence, the proposed framework directly links productivity with the two types of resilience. We applied the Färe-Primont method of TFP decomposition, into technological change and various types of efficiency changes and a detailed farm survey to distinguish between the drivers of technological changes in each farming sector such as specific innovations and ecosystem services. Our findings show that farms differ in their revealed resilience both among the sectors and between two different shock events. Only field crop farms and granivores farms (pig and poultry) maintained their resilience to both crises, staying robust and/or adaptable. The former had the most productive technology and were leaders in applying innovations while the latter were second best in innovations and fairly good in their application of ecosystem-based services into their technology. Other farm types failed to be resilient to the first crisis but proved robust during the second. The outcomes of the study have implications for sustainability oriented policies.","Zawalińska, Katarzyna; Wąs, Adam; Kobus, Paweł; Bańkowska, Katarzyna",Sustain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8504572/,383

Each of the participant researchers have situated Dance, Drama, Media Arts, Music and Visual Arts within the context of the Australian Curriculum: The Arts and what they characterise as its social justice imperatives. A narrative phenomenological approach has been adopted to enable the participant researchers to socially co-construct an analysis of their experiences working with the Australian Curriculum: The Arts including challenges, implications and the future for their respective discipline areas and the Arts overall. The three key themes from these collective voices revealed a quality arts education is an entitlement for every child and young person; the Arts provide important opportunities for children and young people from diverse backgrounds and cultures to demonstrate their learning, express themselves and participate; and arts educators and the Arts industry need to work together to strengthen community understanding about the value of the Arts in education. This process provided important insights into how exposure and engagement with the Arts shape the ways in which children and young people make meaning in their lives, enhance their overall wellbeing, increase their sense of social responsibility and contribute to a socially-just society.","Kerby, Martin; Lorenza, Linda; Dyson, Julie; Ewing, Robyn; Baguley, Margaret",Aust Educ Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8507504/,383

In commemoration of this event, we use a bibliometric analysis to present a retrospective on the journal by analyzing its content for the years between 2006 and 2020. We find that the collaboration culture in MIR has risen over time with the increase in the median size of author teams. Moreover, the collaboration network has become more global over time. The methodology used in the journal is predominantly empirical and quantitative with archival data sources most commonly used. The bibliographic coupling of the MIR corpus reveals that the major themes in the journal revolve around “culture,” “emerging economies,” “innovation, knowledge transfer, and absorptive capacity,” “internationalization process,” “culture and entry modes,” and “internationalization and performance.” A comparison with other leading international business journals provides distinct pathways in which MIR may continue to grow. Finally, it is important to note that while the share of conceptual studies has decreased significantly in the last 15 years, the MIR editors want to see more novel and theoretically grounded conceptual articles in the journal.","Mukherjee, Debmalya; Kumar, Satish; Donthu, Naveen; Pandey, Nitesh",Manag Int Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8512651/,383

METHODS We searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases to identify qualitative studies reporting parents' views and experiences of caring for a child with type 1 diabetes aged ≤8 years. Key analytical themes were identified using thematic synthesis. RESULTS Fourteen studies were included. The synthesis resulted in the generation of two overarching themes. Monopolisation of life describes the all-encompassing impact diabetes could have on parents due to the constant worry they experienced and the perceived need for vigilance. It describes how parents' caring responsibilities could affect their wellbeing, relationships and finances, and how a lack of trusted sources of childcare and a desire to enable a 'normal' childhood constrained personal choices and activities. However, use of diabetes technologies could lessen some of these burdens. Experiences of professional and informal support describes how encounters with healthcare professionals, while generally perceived as helpful, could lead to frustration and anxiety, and how connecting with other parents caring for a child with type 1 diabetes provided valued emotional and practical support. CONCLUSIONS This synthesis outlines the challenges parents encounter, their views about support received and ways in which support might be improved. It also highlights significant limitations in the current literature and points to important areas for future research, including how sociodemographic factors and use of newer diabetes technologies influence parents' diabetes management practices and experiences.

Although usually it results in a mild illness, certain patient groups are at increased risk for complications. The authors reviewed their experience in a pediatric hematology-oncology unit to determine the outcome of this disease in children with hematological conditions and solid tumors. During the second outbreak (1 November 2009 to 14 January 2010), a total of 187 children from pediatric clinic were tested for H1N1 influenza A by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 63 of them were positive. Patients' signs and symptoms were recorded prospectively. Ten (35.7%) (5 children with solid tumors, 4 with leukemia, 1 with hereditary spherocytosis) of 28 tested children with hematological conditions were diagnosed with 2009 H1N1 influenza infection. Fever (100%) and cough (90%) were the most common symptoms. Five were neutropenic (neutrophil count <1000/mm(3)), 4 had severe neutropenia (neutrophil count <500/mm(3)). Systemic antibiotics were given in 5 patients with the diagnosis of febrile neutropenia. Four were inpatients, others were hospitalized after the diagnosis. One patient required mechanical ventilation; however, he had concomitant invasive fungal infection. Eight patients were treated by oseltamivir, all tolerated the drug well. A total of 4 cases from 9 cancer patients had a delay in their planned chemotherapy for 7 to 15 days. Pandemic H1N1 influenza caused mild symptoms in children with cancer and/or hematological conditions but resulted in delay in anticancer therapy and increase in hospitalization and antibiotic usage.","Ozdemir, Nihal; Celkan, Tiraje; Midilli, Kenan; Aygün, Gökhan; Sinekbasan, Serhat; Kılıç, Omer; Apak, Hilmi; Camcıoğlu, Yıldız; Yıldız, Inci",Pediatric hematology and oncology,https://doi.org/10.3109/08880018.2010.550986; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21413832/,383

HYPOTHESIS Certain preoperative variables might be predictive risk factors for AF recurrence among patients who underwent this procedure. METHODS From October 2010 to April 2014, 114 patients with either paroxysmal AF (PAF) or nonparoxysmal AF (non-PAF) underwent the procedure and completed postoperative cardiac-rhythm measurement via electrocardiography and Holter monitoring. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the possible AF-related risk factors were conducted. RESULTS During 2-year follow-up, 99 of 114 patients (86.8%) were free from atrial tachyarrhythmia. Results from univariate analyses showed that AF duration, left atrial diameter (LAD), left atrial minimum volume, left atrial empty fraction, left atrial expansion index, and left atrial active empty fraction (LAAEF) were significantly associated with postoperative AF recurrence. Results from multivariate analyses showed that AF duration (odds ratio [OR]: 1.194, 95% CI: 1.063-1.340, P = 0.003), LAD (OR: 1.101, 95% CI: 1.005-1.205, P = 0.039), and LAAEF (OR: 0.490, 95% CI: 0.277-0.865, P = 0.014) were independent risk factors. There was no difference in AF recurrence between patients with PAF and non-PAF (P = 0.250). CONCLUSIONS Our 2-year follow-up study suggested that low LAAEF, long AF duration, and large LAD might be potential predictive risk factors for AF recurrence. Patients with PAF and non-PAF had a similar AF recurrence rate after modified endoscopic ablation.","An, Kang; Zhu, Jiaquan; Ma, Nan; Tang, Min; Mei, Ju",Clinical cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.22878; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29480515/,383

Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the literature on such disparities does not exist to date. The objective of this study is to describe health services disparities in pediatric anesthetic care in the pre-, intra-, or post-operative period by synthesizing current literature. We searched the National Library of Medicine's PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Web of Science for articles published between January 1, 2007, and May 9, 2020, to identify literature on racial and ethnic health services disparities in pediatric anesthesia. We used the Institute of Medicine's definition of disparities. Health services were related to pre-, intra-, or post-operative anesthetic care of pediatric patients (< 18 years old). Out of 2110 studies, 10 studies met the criteria for inclusion. Nine out of the ten articles were single-institutional observational studies, based at tertiary hospitals.

Predictors of behaviour change were assessed using multivariable regression models. RESULTS 30% of the cohort had a COVID-19 at risk health condition, 37% were classed as deprived and 6% self-reported a mental health condition. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, participants ate almost one portion of fruit and vegetables less per day (vegetables mean difference -0.33, 95% CI -0.40, -0.25; fruit -0.57, 95% CI -0.64, -0.50), but showed no change in high sugar portions per day (-0.03, 95% CI -0.12, 0.06). Participants spent half a day less per week doing ≥30 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (-0.57, 95% CI -0.73, -0.40) but slightly increased days of strength training (0.21, 95% CI 0.09, 0.34), increased alcohol intake (AUDIT-C score change 0.25, 95% CI 0.13, 0.37), though did not change smoking, vaping or substance use behaviour. Worsening health behaviour change was associated with being younger, female and higher body mass index. CONCLUSIONS The cohort reported worsening health behaviours during early lockdown. Longer term changes will be investigated using further waves of data collection.","Naughton, Felix; Ward, Emma; Khondoker, Mizanur; Belderson, Pippa; Marie Minihane, Anne; Dainty, Jack; Hanson, Sarah; Holland, Richard; Brown, Tracey; Notley, Caitlin",British journal of health psychology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33410229/,383

66500,COVID-19 and beyond.,2020-06-01,"OBJECTIVES The widespread variation seen in human growth globally stands at odds with the global health perspective that young child growth should not vary across populations if nutritional, environmental and care needs are met. This paper: (1) evaluates the idea that a single standard of ""healthy"" growth characterizes children under age 5, (2) discusses how variation from this standard is viewed in global health, in human biology and by parents, and (3) explores how views of ""normal"" growth shape biomedical and parental responses. METHODS This paper reviews the anthropological, public health and clinical literature on the nature of child growth and the applicability of World Health Organization Multicenter Growth Reference Study growth standards across contexts. RESULTS The considerable variability in child growth across contexts makes it unlikely that any one framework, with issues of sample selection and representativeness, can serve as the model of healthy growth. Global health, human biology and parents differ in the emphasis they place on heredity versus environmental context in understanding this variability, but human biologists and parents tend to view a wider range of growth as ""normal."" Since both biomedicine and parents base their care decisions on their perceptions of normal, healthy growth, the comparative framework used has important implications for medical treatment and feeding practices. CONCLUSIONS A more nuanced approach that incorporates the biology of growth and its association with health outcomes across contexts is critical to identify patterns of healthy growth and to avoid over-reliance on a single standard that may pathologize variability.","Thompson, Amanda L",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763952/,383

We identified existing CDEs and evaluated their validity and usability, which is required prior to infrastructure implementation within EHRs. METHODS We conducted (a) a systematic literature review of publications in Medline, Embase and the Web of Science using a combination of at least one term related to OUD and EHR and (b) an environmental scan of publicly available data systems and dictionaries used in national informatics and quality measurement of policy initiatives. Opioid-related data elements identified within the environmental scan were compared with related data elements contained within nine common health data code systems and each element was graded for alignment with match results categorized as ""exact"", ""partial"", or ""none."" RESULTS The literature review identified 5186 articles for title search, of which 75 abstracts were included for review and 38 articles were selected for full-text review. Full-text articles yielded 237 CDEs, only 12 (5.06%) of which were opioid-specific. The environmental scan identified 379 potential data elements and value sets across 9 data systems and libraries, among which only 84 (22%) were opioid-specific. We found substantial variability in the types of clinical data elements with limited overlap and no single data system included CDEs across all major data element types such as substance use disorder, OUD, medication and mental health. Relative to common health data code systems, few data elements had an exact match (< 1%), while 61% had a partial match and 38% had no matches. CONCLUSIONS Despite the increasing ubiquity of EHR data standards and national attention placed on the opioid epidemic, we found substantial fragmentation in the design and construction of OUD related CDEs and little OUD specific CDEs in existing data dictionaries, systems and literature. Given the significant gaps in data collection and reporting, future work should leverage existing structured data elements to create standard workflow processes to improve OUD data capture in EHR systems.","Venkatesh, Arjun; Malicki, Caitlin; Hawk, Kathryn; D'Onofrio, Gail; Kinsman, Jeremiah; Taylor, Andrew",Addiction science & clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13722-020-00198-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32650817/,383

The objective of this study was to create a case ascertainment method for PD within two prospective Dutch cohorts based on multiple sources of PD information. This method was validated using clinical records from the general practitioners (GPs). Face validity of the case ascertainment was tested for three etiological factors (smoking, sex and family history of PD). In total 54825 participants were included from the cohorts AMIGO and EPIC-NL. Sources of PD information included self-reported PD, self-reported PD medication, a 9 item screening questionnaire (Tanner), electronical medical records, hospital discharge data and mortality records. Based on these sources we developed a likelihood score with 4 categories (no PD, unlikely PD, possible PD, likely PD). For the different sources of PD information and for the likelihood score we present the agreement with GP-validated cases. Risk of PD for established factors was studied by logistic regression as exact diagnose dates were not always available. Based on the algorithm, we assigned 346 participants to the likely PD category. GP validation confirmed 67% of these participants in EPIC-NL, but only 12% in AMIGO. PD was confirmed in only 3% of the participants with a possible PD classification. PD case ascertainment by mortality records (91%), EMR ICPC (82%) and self-reported information (62-69%) had the highest confirmation rates. The Tanner PD screening questionnaire had a lower agreement (18%). Risk estimates for smoking, family history and sex using all likely PD cases were comparable to the literature for EPIC-NL, but not for smoking in AMIGO. Using multiple sources of PD evidence in cohorts remains important but challenging as performance of sources varied in validity.","Reedijk, Marije; Huss, Anke; Verheij, Robert A; Peeters, Petra H; Vermeulen, Roel C H",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609766/,383

In the last years, Lung Ultrasound (LUS) has gained a primary role in the diagnosis and management of pleuropulmonary disorders, also in pediatric practice and in the diagnosis and follow-up of pulmonary edema through the qualitative analysis of ultrasound B-lines.Aim of this case report is that to keep high clinicians' attention to the diagnosis that of Rheumatic Heart Disease also in high-income countries and to deepen the role and importance of lung ultrasound, in clinical practice, in diagnosis and follow-up of pediatric lung diseases, especially in emergency settings as happened in our case. METHODS We present the case of a 14-year-old Italian boy from a medium-low socio-economic and cultural class Italian family, who was diagnosed with severe and advanced stage RHD, which had remained undiagnosed until then. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS In the diagnostic process of our case, LUS played a fundamental role because it quickly directed us, contextually to the clinical and anamnestic evaluation, towards the right diagnosis, in a Pediatric Emergency Department. In clinical practice, the only LUS findings and the only qualitative analysis of the B-lines, does not make clinicians able to make a clear characterization yet. Thus the study of cardiovascular function, laboratory parameters, anamnestic and clinical data continue to be useful tools to assist the LUS in the diagnostic processes of lung diseases, as was the case in our case.","De Rose, Cristina; Buonsenso, Danilo; De Rosa, Gabriella; Chiaretti, Antonio",Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v92i3.11351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34212908/,383

He showed signs of debilitating dystonia that had been present since puberty. Dystonic symptoms, especially a protrusion of the tongue and bilateral hand tremor, had not responded to botulinum toxin therapy. We diagnosed Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome (MTS). METHODS AND MATERIAL Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the bilateral globus pallidus internus was performed predominantly with stereotaxic computed tomography angiography guidance under general anesthesia. Electrophysiology was used to identify the target regions and to guide DBS electrode placement. RESULTS In the immediate postoperative course and stimulation, the patient showed marked improvement of facial, extremity, and cervical dystonia. More than 2 years after implantation, his dystonic symptoms had dramatically improved by 82%. DISCUSSION MTS is a rare genetic disorder leading to sensorineural deafness, dystonia, and other symptoms. The use of DBS for the dystonia in MTS was previously described but not in the presence of bilateral CIs. CONCLUSION DBS in MTS may be a viable option to treat debilitating dystonic symptoms. We describe successful DBS surgery, despite the presence of bilateral CIs, and stimulation therapy over 2 years.","Coenen, Volker Arnd; Rijntjes, Michel; Sajonz, Bastian; Piroth, Tobias; Prokop, Thomas; Jost, Wolfgang; Trippel, Michael; Urbach, Horst; Reinacher, Peter Christoph","Journal of neurological surgery.

68306,"Response to ""Reduction in skin cancer diagnosis, and overall cancer referrals, during the COVID-19 pandemic"".",2020-11-05,"5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is an important component of chemotherapy for metastatic colon cancer and can be administered as an intravenous infusion or bolus. Coronary vasospasm is a known complication of infusional and bolus 5-FU administration. In patients who experience coronary vasospasm, 5-FU is often discontinued. Several cases of successful re-challenge with bolus 5-FU, utilizing calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and nitrates to prophylaxis against coronary vasospasm recurrence, have been reported in the literature. However, since there is increased variability of time to symptom onset with infusional 5-FU, re-challenge with infusional 5-FU has not been widely studied. Given potential differences in the toxicity profile and exposure time, infusional may be more appropriate than bolus for some patients. Here we report successful re-challenge with infusional 5-FU, following coronary vasospasm during the first cycle of 5-FU plus leucovorin plus oxaliplatin chemotherapy, in a patient with metastatic colon cancer and coronary artery disease (CAD). The 5-FU re-challenge plan included dose reduction, CCB and nitrate prophylaxis, and telemetry monitoring.","Redman, Jason M; Rhea, Logan P; Brofferio, Alessandra; Whelpley, Margaret; Gulley, James L; Gatti-Mays, Margaret E; McMahon, Sheri; Cordes, Lisa M; Strauss, Julius",Journal of gastrointestinal oncology,https://doi.org/10.21037/jgo.2019.07.04; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602339/,383

METHODS A systematic literature review and analysis of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer database was performed to develop proposals for revision in an iterative process involving multispecialty international input and review. RESULTS Details of the evidence base are summarized in other articles. Four patterns of disease are recognized; the clinical presentation, pathologic correlates, and biologic behavior of these suggest specific applications of the TNM classification rules. First, it is proposed that second primary lung cancers be designated with a T, N, and M category for each tumor. Second, tumors with a separate tumor nodule of the same histologic type (either suspected or proved) should be classified according to the location of the separate nodule relative to the index tumor-T3 for a same-lobe, T4 for a same-side (different lobe), and M1a for an other-side location-with a single N and M category. Third, multiple tumors with prominent ground glass (imaging) or lepidic (histologic) features should be designated by the T category of the highest T lesion, the number or m in parentheses (#/m) to indicate the multiplicity, and a collective N and M category for all. Finally, it is proposed that diffuse pneumonic-type lung cancers be designated by size (or T3) if in one lobe, T4 if involving multiple same-side lobes, and M1a if involving both lungs with a single N and M category for all areas of involvement. CONCLUSION We propose to tailor TNM classification of multiple pulmonary sites of lung cancer to reflect the unique aspects of four different patterns of presentation. We hope that this will lead to more consistent classification and clarity in communication and facilitate further research in the nature and optimal treatment of these entities.","Detterbeck, Frank C; Nicholson, Andrew G; Franklin, Wilbur A; Marom, Edith M; Travis, William D; Girard, Nicolas; Arenberg, Douglas A; Bolejack, Vanessa; Donington, Jessica S; Mazzone, Peter J; Tanoue, Lynn T; Rusch, Valerie W; Crowley, John; Asamura, Hisao; Rami-Porta, Ramón",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.01.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940528/,383

We conducted a study aimed to determine the frequency of RVI in children with low compared with high risk for invasive bacterial infection (IBI) FN episodes and compare the clinical outcome of RVI and mixed RV-bacterial infections. METHODS Prospective, multicenter study in children with cancer and FN admitted to pediatric hospitals in Chile between May 2009 and January 2011. Children were evaluated by clinical examination and laboratory tests, including bacterial cultures and their risk for IBI. Nasopharyngeal sample was obtained for the detection of 17 respiratory viruses using polymerase chain reaction-DNA microarray platform. RESULTS A total of 331 episodes of FN in 193 children were enrolled of whom 55% were male, with the median age of 7 years and 61% had a hematological malignancy. A viral and/or bacterial pathogen was detected in 67% (224/331) episodes. Overall, RVIs were associated with 57% of FN of which one-third were mixed RV-bacterial infections. Bacterial infection was detected in 29% (97/331). Children classified at admission as high risk for IBI had a similar overall proportion of RVI compared with low-risk group. Respiratory syncytial virus (31%) and rhinovirus (23%) were the most frequently detected respiratory viruses, followed by parainfluenza (12%) and influenza A (11%). Children detected with any respiratory virus had fewer days of hospitalization and a significantly lower probability of hypotension and admission to pediatric intensive care unit irrespective of their risk classification status at admission when compared with children with mixed RV-bacterial or bacterial infections (P < 0.05). All children with a sole RVI had favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS RVIs were the most frequently detected agents irrespective of their initial risk assessment for IBI. The clinical outcome of mixed RVI was similar to sole RVI episodes as well as for bacterial infections compared with mixed viral-bacterial infections. Systematic and early detection of RVI in children with cancer and FN might help to optimize their management by reducing hospitalization and antimicrobial use.","Torres, Juan P; Labraña, Yenis; Ibañez, Carolina; Kasaneva, Pilar; Farfán, Mauricio J; De la Maza, Verónica; Villarroel, Milena; Vergara, Ivonne; Piemonte, Paula; Zubieta, Marcela; Salgado, Carmen; Tordecilla, Juan; Topelberg, Santiago; O Ryan, Miguel; Santolaya, María E",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e31825c4b7e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22565292/,383

This article highlights that diurnal IOP fluctuations obtained using self-tonometry may more accurately reflect IOP responses to therapy. PURPOSE This study aimed to investigate fluctuations in diurnal IOP measurements in patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension treated with latanoprost 0.005% and timolol 0.25%. METHODS In this crossover treatment trial, 14 participants performed self-tonometry with iCare HOME 4 times daily for (1) 1 week using latanoprost, (2) 4 weeks using no medications, and (3) 2 weeks using timolol. Daily peak IOPs, IOP fluctuations, and mean IOPs from different treatments were compared on an individual basis. Treatment efficacy between medications was assessed by comparing mean percentage IOP reductions with latanoprost and timolol across participants. In addition, effects of age, years since commencing latanoprost, sex, and diagnosis were investigated, and peak IOP times were compared with assess impacts on diurnal profiles. RESULTS Between individuals, IOP responses ranged from reductions in peak IOPs, IOP fluctuations, and mean IOPs on both medications to no change in any parameter and medication. IOP fluctuations showed greater mean percentage reductions than did peak and mean IOPs (χ2 = 16.51, P = .002). There were significant associations between years since commencing latanoprost and peak and mean IOP responses on timolol (r = 0.69, P = .007), and sex and relative reductions in IOP fluctuations on both medications (P = .03). There were no differences in peak IOP times between treatment conditions. CONCLUSIONS Despite variability in IOP responses to latanoprost and timolol, IOP fluctuation with self-tonometry was more consistent in evaluating target IOP, reflecting its importance in ascertaining true IOP response to topical therapies. These findings may impact clinical decision making based on target IOP criteria in patients on topical therapy.","Tong, Janelle; Huang, Jessie; Kalloniatis, Michael; Coroneo, Minas; Zangerl, Barbara",Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,https://doi.org/10.1097/opx.0000000000001751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34393206/,383

Here we describe the first detailed investigation of the combined changes in morphology, physiological status and nutritional condition over the moult cycle of juvenile T. australiensis. Haemolymph refractive index (measured as Brix) was evaluated as a non-destructive method for predicting physiological status and nutritional condition. Post-moult, inter-moult and pre-moult stages were identifiable by microscopic examination of the pleopod distal tips, though differentiation of the pre-moult substages was not possible using this technique. Monitoring of ecdysial suture lines on the exoskeleton gill chambers was found to be highly useful for visually determining progression through the pre-moult stage and predicting the timing of ecdysis. A classical pattern of inter-moult growth was observed where size and wet weight remained relatively uniform over the moult cycle while highly significant changes in whole-body composition were simultaneously observed over time. Growth was most evident by changes in dry weight and dry matter content which more than doubled by the onset of pre-moult. Changes in dry matter content were generally mirrored by Brix and whole-body crude protein, total lipid and gross energy content. Brix strongly correlated with dry matter content and significant correlations were also found for all other primary measures of nutritional condition. Typical moult-related changes were also found for circulating ecdysteroids. This study clearly demonstrates pronounced cyclical changes in physiology and condition of juvenile T. australiensis over a typical moult cycle. The significant correlations between haemolymph and whole-body composition validates Brix as a practical and non-destructive method to objectively assess physiological status, nutritional condition and quality in T. australiensis and further demonstrates its potential for individual crustacean assessment in experimental research and practical commercial applications.","Landman, Michael J; Fitzgibbon, Quinn P; Wirtz, Andrea; Codabaccus, Basseer M; Ventura, Tomer; Smith, Gregory G; Carter, Chris G","Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

These problems revolve around concepts that we call ""perspectival fidelity"" and ""context realism."" Moral dilemmas that include features present in the Bridge variant will, as a result, be practically impossible to simulate. We also argue that, should we be wrong about the practical impossibility of creating a VR simulation of Bridge, such a simulation must face an ethical horn which renders these simulations ethically impermissible to develop or use. For these reasons, we argue that it is virtually impossible to simulate the bridge problem (and other thought experiments with similar features) both practically and ethically in VR.","Ramirez, Erick Jose; LaBarge, Scott",Science and engineering ethics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-020-00267-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079342/,383

Does the same theory also explain variation in phenotypic error rates and in abundance of error mitigation mechanisms? Translational read-through provides a model to investigate both issues as it is common, mostly non-adaptive, and has good proxy for rate (TAA being the least leaky stop codon) and potential error mitigation via ""fail-safe"" 3' additional stop codons (ASCs). Prior theory of translational read-through has suggested that when population sizes are high, weak selection for local mitigation can be effective thus predicting a positive correlation between ASC enrichment and Ne. Contra to prediction, we find that ASC enrichment is not correlated with Ne. ASC enrichment, while highly phylogenetically patchy, is, however, more common both in unicellular species and in genes expressed in unicellular modes in multicellular species. By contrast, Ne does positively correlate with TAA enrichment.

However, the use of the available systems has been associated with vascular injury, resulting in vasospasm and vessel wall thrombosis. The OneShot System (Covidien, San Jose, CA, USA) is an irrigated radiofrequency balloon designed to reduce vessel heating and injury during RADN. METHODS AND RESULTS The aim of the present study was to evaluate the target vessel morphological features before and after renal ablation using the OneShot RADN system. In this prospective observational study, 12 renal arteries of patients underwent RADN using the OneShot™ RADN System. Pre-procedural and post-procedural optical coherence tomography (OCT) pullbacks were performed and evaluated. No evidence for vasospasm, oedema or intraluminal thrombus formation was detected. Limited arterial dissections, after RADN, occurred in three renal arteries and did not require additional treatments. A sustained reduction of office blood pressure levels was observed over six months of follow-up in all the patients. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that, in a small patient population, RADN using the OneShot Renal Denervation System is not associated with arterial spasm or thrombus formation on the vessel wall.","Stabile, Eugenio; Ambrosini, Vittorio; Squarcia, Roberta; Salemme, Luigi; Popusoi, Grigore; Esposito, Giovanni; Trimarco, Bruno; Rubino, Paolo",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.4244/eijv9i6a113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24169131/,383

The conserved sequence is believed to contribute to its unique antibacterial activities. To design novel drugs based on hBD-3, predicting the binding free energy contribution of each residue on hBD-3 with bacterial membrane is important. Firstly, the stable binding structure of hBD-3 dimer in analog form bound on POPG lipid bilayer was predicted using NAMD simulations, which was confirmed by RMSD, buried surface area, hydrogen bonds, distance map, and insertion depth map calculations. Then, free energy perturbation (FEP) method was applied to calculate the binding free energy of each residue by mutating it into Alanine. It was found that the positively charged residues on the tail region of hBD-3 contribute significantly to its binding with membrane. The result emphasized the importance of electrostatic interactions to hBD-3's binding with bacterial membrane.","Brewer, Ann; Zhang, Liqun",Biophysical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpc.2021.106662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399250/,383

73693,Pemphigus and COVID-19: Critical overview of management with a focus on treatment choice.,2020-09-03,"PURPOSE The diagnosis of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome traditionally involves orthostatic vitals evaluation. The Compensatory Reserve Index is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared algorithm that analyses photoplethysmogram waveforms in real time to trend subtle waveform features associated with varying degrees of central volume loss, from normovolemia to decompensation. We hypothesised that patients who met physiologic criteria for Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome would have greater changes in Compensatory Reserve Index with orthostatic vitals. METHODS Orthostatic vitals and Compensatory Reserve Index values were assessed in individuals previously diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome and healthy controls aged 12-21 years. Adolescents were grouped for comparison based on whether they met heart rate criteria for Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome (physiologic Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome). RESULTS Sixty-one patients were included. Eighteen percent of patients with an existing Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome diagnosis met heart rate criteria, and these patients had significantly greater supine to standing change in Compensatory Reserve Index (0.67 vs. 0.51; p<0.001). The optimal change in Compensatory Reserve Index for physiologic Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome was 0.60. Patients with physiologic Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome were more likely to report previous diagnoses of anxiety or depression (p = 0.054, 0.042). CONCLUSION An accurate diagnosis of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome may be confounded by related comorbidities. Only 18% (8/44) of previously diagnosed Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome patients met heart rate criteria. Findings support the utility of objective physiologic measures, such as the Compensatory Reserve Index, to more accurately identify patients with true autonomic dysfunction.","Shahi, Niti; Shirek, Gabrielle; Pickett, Kaci; Schwartz, Alexandra; Shoop, Jamie; Phillips, Ryan; Workman, Rachel; Kaplan, David; Pitula, Clio; Moulton, Steven",Cardiology in the young,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1047951120002905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32993834/,383

METHODS We conducted a hospital-based retrospective study on 435 medical staff who might use or not to use thymosin drugs for preventive medicines in our hospital. For the prophylactics, medical staff was prevented from pre-exposure prophylaxis (risk prevention of exposure to COVID-19 patients before using thymosin drugs) and post-exposure prophylaxis (risk prevention of exposure to COVID-19 patients with after using thymosin drugs). Effectiveness and safety of thymosin drugs in the prevention and control of COVID-19 application, in real world data research for the application of the drug in COVID- 19. RESULTS In the similar exposure environment, compared to medical staff who did not take preventive medicine, the use of thymosin drugs, before exposure and after exposure had an insignificant effect, and the adverse drug reaction (ADR) was increased, especially when thymosin drugs used together with α-interferon. CONCLUSIONS Thymosin drugs had no significant effect on the prevention of COVID-19 before and after exposure for medical staff, along with certain ADRs, so preventive medication of thymosin drugs was not recommended.

However, they are rare abnormalities (in ∼1% of non-small cell lung carcinomas) that are typically identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and so screening using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining would be both cost- and time-efficient. METHODS A cohort of lung tumors negative for other common mutations related to targeted therapies were screened to assess the sensitivity and specificity of IHC staining in detecting ROS1 gene rearrangements, enriched by four other cases first identified by FISH. A review of published data was also undertaken. RESULTS IHC staining was 100% sensitive (95% confidence interval: 48-100) and 83% specific (95% confidence interval: 86-100) overall when an h-score higher than 100 was used. Patients with ROS1 gene rearrangements were younger and typically never-smokers, with the tumors all being adenocarcinomas with higher-grade architectural features and focal signet ring morphologic features (two of five). Four patients treated with crizotinib showed a partial response, with three also showing a partial response to pemetrexed. Three of four patients remain alive at 13, 27, and 31 months, respectively. CONCLUSION IHC staining can be used to screen for ROS1 gene rearrangements, with patients herein showing a response to crizotinib. Patients with tumors that test positive according to IHC staining but negative according to FISH were also identified, which may have implications for treatment selection.","Viola, Patrizia; Maurya, Manisha; Croud, James; Gazdova, Jana; Suleman, Nadia; Lim, Eric; Newsom-Davis, Tom; Plowman, Nick; Rice, Alexandra; Montero, M Angeles; Gonzalez de Castro, David; Popat, Sanjay; Nicholson, Andrew G",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.03.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27179848/,383

In the quest for new functionality, a vastly unexplored avenue is interfacing oxide perovskites with materials having dissimilar crystallochemical properties. Here, we propose a unique class of heterointerfaces based on nitride antiperovskite and oxide perovskite materials as a previously unidentified direction for materials design. We demonstrate the fabrication of atomically sharp interfaces between nitride antiperovskite Mn3GaN and oxide perovskites (La0.3Sr0.7)(Al0.65Ta0.35)O3 and SrTiO3. Using atomic-resolution imaging/spectroscopic techniques and first-principles calculations, we determine the atomic-scale structure, composition, and bonding at the interface. The epitaxial antiperovskite/perovskite heterointerface is mediated by a coherent interfacial monolayer that interpolates between the two antistructures. We anticipate our results to be an important step for the development of functional antiperovskite/perovskite heterostructures, combining their unique characteristics such as topological properties for ultralow-power applications.","Quintela, Camilo X; Song, Kyung; Shao, Ding-Fu; Xie, Lin; Nan, Tianxiang; Paudel, Tula R; Campbell, Neil; Pan, Xiaoqing; Tybell, Thomas; Rzchowski, Mark S; Tsymbal, Evgeny Y; Choi, Si-Young; Eom, Chang-Beom",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba4017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832665/,383

Obese breast cancer patients have at least a 30% increased risk of death from breast cancer compared to non-obese breast cancer patients because they present with larger tumors and generally have increased rates of metastasis. Moreover, obese breast cancer patients respond more poorly to treatment compared to non-obese patients, particularly pre-menopausal women diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). To help understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased metastasis associated with obesity, we previously established a three-dimensional culture system that permits the co-culture of adipocytes and TNBC cells in a manner that mimics an in vivo milieu. Using this system, we demonstrate that white adipose tissue from both lean and obese mice can induce a partial mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Triple negative breast cancer cells adopt an epithelial morphology and have an increased expression of some epithelial markers, but they maintain the expression of mesenchymal markers, furnishing the breast cancer cells with hybrid properties that are associated with more aggressive tumors. Thus, these data suggest that adipose tissue has the potential to promote secondary tumor formation in lean and obese women. Further work is needed to determine if targeting the partial MET induced by adipose tissue could reduce metastasis.","Asante, Emmanuel C; Pallegar, Nikitha K; Hoffmann, Alica J; Viloria-Petit, Alicia M; Christian, Sherri L",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899433/,383

METHODS Convectional 2.0 polyglyconate suture was used in the control group (CG n = 10) and 2.0 barbed polyglyconate suture in the barbed group (BG n = 10) to perform celiorrhaphy (simple continuous pattern) and subcutaneous closure (continuous intradermal pattern). Data were assessed using paired (leukogram between 24 and 48 h within the same group) and unpaired (leukogram, surgical time, tissue thickness, and costs) Student's t-test. The Fisher exact test was used to assess the occurrence of seroma between groups (p < 0.05). Results are shown as mean ± standard error of mean. RESULTS The time spent to perform the celiorrhaphy (195.30 ± 17.37 s vs. 204 ± 16.00 s), subcutaneous closure (174.0 ± 15.86 s vs. 198.0 ± 15.62 s), and the total surgical time (24.30 ± 1.44 min vs. 23.00 ± 1.30 min) did not differ between BG and CG, respectively (p > 0.05). Leukogram at 48 h post-surgery did not differ between groups (p = 0.20). No differences were observed in the subcutaneous and the abdominal wall thickness (cm) assessed by ultrasonography at 48 h in BG (0.31 ± 0.04, 0.80 ± 0.05) and CG (0.34 ± 0.03, 0.72 ± 0.06), respectively. Similarly, 15 days post-surgery the same structures did not differ between BG (0.26 ± 0.02, 0.74 ± 0.08) and CG (0.26 ± 0.03, 0.64 ± 0.05) (p > 0.05). In one bitch from each group, a mild seroma was observed on one side of the surgical wound 48 h after surgery (p = 1.00). The procedures in which barbed sutures were used had an average additional cost of R$ 200.00 ± 11.66 (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Barbed suture has proven to be efficient and safe for abdominal and subcutaneous closure. However, considering its current high cost in addition thatthe surgical time of bitches with pyometra undergone OH was not reduced, no advantages were observed with theuse of barbed sutures for this type of surgery.","Lima, Helen Cristina Gomes de; Ribeiro, Alexandre Pinto; Souza, Jéssica Ávila de; Vieira, Raphael Rogger; Fernandes, Michelly Ferreira",Acta cirurgica brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/acb360502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34133504/,383

Mental health and social isolation are negatively impacted by homelessness, increasing the importance of the owner-pet bond during this time. However, this relationship is complicated by the need for pet owners to urgently find accommodation for themselves while still caring for their pets. This paper explores two firsthand narratives of the relationship between a person and their pets during a period of homelessness and subsequent search for accommodation. Both narratives highlight important aspects of the emotional bond between owner and pet: the concept of choosing pet over place; improved mental health and changed behaviours; and stressors or negative emotions of parental concern, separation anxiety and grief. These narratives emphasise the importance of supporting, expanding and creating new pet-friendly crisis and permanent accommodation options for pet owners experiencing homelessness.","Cleary, Michelle; West, Sancia; Visentin, Denis; Phipps, Monique; Westman, Mark; Vesk, Kristina; Kornhaber, Rachel",Issues in mental health nursing,https://doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2020.1843096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33196324/,383

Herein, an efficient HER electrocatalyst based on flowerlike S-doped Ni2P mesoporous nanosheets supported on nickel foam (S-Ni2P NSs/NF) was developed through an effective approach. The obtained S-Ni2P NSs/NF catalyst required low overpotential of only 87.5 mV and 179.1 mV to reach current density of 10 and 50 mA cm-2, respectively. Moreover, a small Tafel slope of 62.1 mV dec-1 for S-Ni2P NSs/NF demonstrated that HER process occurred with very fast kinetics. Besides high HER activity, the synthesized S-Ni2P NSs/NF catalyst exhibited superior stability and long-term durability toward HER, which had ability to operate over 30 h without degradation in catalytic performance. The unique flower-like nanosheets structure with excellent mesoporous characteristics of S-Ni2P NSs/NF resulted in maximizing electrochemical active surface area for providing a large number of electrocatalytic active sites. In addition, S doping effect could modulate electronic structure of Ni species in Ni2P, leading to accelerating rate adsorption of reaction intermediates on the surface of catalysts toward improving HER kinetics. The results not only demonstrate S-Ni2P NSs/NF as active catalyst for HER, but also offer effective strategy for improving catalytic activity of earth-abundant transition metal-based HER catalysts.","L L, D Thi; Tuyen, P N K; Vu, Thien Y",Nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/abad5d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764199/,383

Intrathecal morphine has been noted to have a potentially potent effect on thermoregulation. This retrospective case-control study sought to investigate the incidence of perioperative hypothermia in women undergoing cesarean delivery with and without intrathecal morphine and to describe any clinical factors associated with the condition, the identification of which would provide direction for nursing priorities in the care of the condition. DESIGN A retrospective case-controlled study design was used. METHODS The charts of 358 women who had undergone emergency or elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia were reviewed: 179 having received intrathecal morphine and 179 having received spinal anesthesia without intrathecal morphine (control group). SPSS (IBM, Armonk, New York), version 22, was used for data analysis, including logistic regression to predict the outcome of hypothermia across the study population. FINDINGS There was no significant difference (P = .62; 95% confidence interval, -0.09 to 0.15) in mean postoperative temperature for the morphine group (mean postanesthesia care unit arrival temperature, 35.91°C; standard deviation, 0.59) and the no morphine group (mean postanesthesia care unit arrival temperature, 35.88°C; standard deviation, 0.52). However, within groups, the temperature decline preoperatively to postoperatively was statistically (and clinically) significant. CONCLUSIONS The results refute the suggestion that intrathecal morphine contributes to greater core temperature decline in this population; however, it does confirm that perioperative hypothermia is a prevalent concern for women undergoing cesarean delivery and that pre-emptive measures should be routinely considered by health care providers.","Munday, Judy; Osborne, Sonya; Yates, Patsy",Journal of perianesthesia nursing : official journal of the American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jopan.2016.04.142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29362044/,383

The impact of this finding on [18F]FDG PET-CT interpretation and its correlation with the induced humoral immunity have been reported. Assuming the amnestic immune response is different following the third vaccine dose, we aimed to explore the incidence of VAHL over time after the third BNT162b2 dose administration, and its relevance to [18F]FDG PET-CT interpretation in oncologic patients. METHODS A total of 179 consecutive oncologic patients that underwent [18F]FDG PET-CT after a third BNT162b2 vaccine dose were included. The presence of VAHL was assessed. On VAHL-positive scans, the SUVmax, number, location, and size of the ""hot"" nodes were recorded. The median time interval between vaccination and imaging was 8 (IQR, 5-14) days. RESULTS The incidences of all-grade VAHL and grade 3-4 VAHL were 47.5% and 8.9%, respectively. VAHL was identified on 82.5% of studies performed within the first 5 days from vaccination. Grade 3-4 VAHL was observed on 28.1% of studies performed within the first 5 days from vaccination, but was not detected on studies performed more than 5 days from vaccination. Separation between VAHL and malignant lymphadenopathy was not possible in only 2 of the 179 study patients. On a multivariable logistic regression, independent predictors of grade 3-4 VAHL were short time interval between vaccination and imaging (Pv < 0.01), younger age (Pv < 0.01), and lower BMI (Pv = 0.03). CONCLUSION VAHL is commonly identified on [18F]FDG PET-CT performed within the first 5 days from the third BNT162b2 vaccine dose administration. High-grade VAHL is unlikely to be observed on a scan performed 6 days or longer from vaccination, and is even less likely in older and obese patients.","Cohen, Dan; Hazut Krauthammer, Shir; Wolf, Ido; Even-Sapir, Einat",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-021-05579-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34651230/,383

This disease was detected in the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019. People infected with COVID-19 shows varying manifestations, depending on their health and age. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, odynophagia, and dyspnea. Infected adults older 60 years of age are the group of patients most susceptible to severe COVID-19 states and present comor-bidity in the presence of chronic diseases. On the other hand, it is also essential to have tests to detect SARS-COV-2 in people and follow the evolution of COVID-19 quickly, reliably, and cheap. To achieve this, there are real-time reverse transcription pol-ymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, isothermal nucleic acid amplification, and enzyme immunostimulation. Currently, there are no drug treatments to prevent infection and to combat the virus's effects. However, different research groups that are conduct-ing in vitro, in vivo, and in silico tests to find drugs able to provide an immune response and to control infection in humans with SARS-CoV-2. Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, interferon-2b, and oseltamivir are some pharmacological options evaluated in clinical trials for prophylaxis of COVID-19. The purpose of this review is to establish a reference framework for taxonomic classification of SARS-CoV-2 and the relationship they have with other CoVs, as well as their structure and propaga-tion pathways in humans. The characteristics and symptoms presented by patients with COVID-19, the detection methods, and possible treatments are also presented.","Santos-Sánchez, Norma Francenia; Salas-Coronado, Raúl",Medwave,https://doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2020.08.8037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33017386/,383

Social vulnerability indices are attempts to create a relative ranking of vulnerability to a natural or anthropogenic hazard across space and have been widely used to quantify community vulnerability to natural disasters. Here, we develop a hierarchical socio-ecological vulnerability index that compares counties in the contiguous United States based on 18 variables grouped into four dimensions (ecological, social, health, and economic) in order to capture a range of factors that might contribute to community vulnerability to Covid-19. Variables were chosen based on a review of the emerging literature about the factors associated with poor health outcomes from Covid-19, information about the economic sectors most at risk from the pandemic and pandemic response, and existing social vulnerability indices. We find that socio-ecological vulnerability to Covid-19 and its related economic effects varies across the contiguous U.S., with especially high vulnerability in the Southeast U.S. and especially low vulnerability in the Upper Midwest, Great Plains, and Mountain West.","Snyder, Brian F; Parks, Vanessa",Health & place,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2020.102471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33129050/,383

In this qualitative study, we aimed to explore the multilevel influences upon PA participation among community-dwelling adults aged 40 years and above living in an urban setting in Kathmandu, Nepal. Men (n = 21) and women (n = 30) were purposively sampled to participate in one of nine focus group discussions. Types of PA undertaken constituted activities related to housework, farm work, and active travel. Individual-level barriers included lack of knowledge, lack of motivation, perceptions of already being active, personal limitations, and lack of time. Interpersonal barriers included household responsibilities and lack of support. Broader environmental barriers included lack of infrastructure for active commuting, poor safety, rising use of motorized transport, lack of resting areas, weak social norms about PA, declining agricultural engagement, mechanization, and improved access to technology and facilities. Some differences were observed between the gender and disease groups. Health benefits, integration into domestic work, opportunities for social interaction, and social support were the facilitators. Interventions focusing on families, highlighting the short- and long-term benefits of PA, addressing gender roles, and ensuring women are better supported represent opportunities to promote PA. Community-based interventions will be essential to establish social norms around PA and improve social support.","Paudel, Susan; Owen, Alice J; Smith, Ben J",Qualitative health research,https://doi.org/10.1177/1049732321993096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33593170/,383

The authors adapted this technique for transanal surgery as an improvement of the transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). METHODS A total of 3 patients underwent SPA modified TEM using the SILS port (Covidien) under CO(2) insufflation. This port allows insertion of 2 laparoscopic instruments and a telescope. RESULTS The operation was completed successfully in all cases. The transanal placement of the SILS port was easy to perform; a prior dilatation of the anal sphincter was not necessary. There were no perioperative or postoperative complications as verified by postoperative observation, rectoscopy, and anal ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS Transanal single port microsurgery is a feasible and new technique for less invasive and more gentle transanal surgery. By using this new multichannel device TEM surgery was changed in a modified way while preserving the anal sphincter.","Lorenz, Cornelia; Nimmesgern, Thomas; Back, Melanie; Langwieler, Thomas E",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350610370751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20504794/,383

85770,Clinicians' User Experience of Telemedicine in Neurosurgery During COVID-19.,2020-10-24,"Hantaviruses such as Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Andes virus cause two human diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, respectively. For both, disease pathogenesis is thought to be immunologically mediated and there have been numerous reports of patients with elevated levels of proinflammatory and inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), in their sera. Multiple viruses have developed evasion strategies to circumvent the host cell inflammatory process, with one of the most prevalent being the disruption of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation. We hypothesized that hantaviruses might also moderate host inflammation by interfering with this pathway. We report here that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of HTNV was able to inhibit TNF-alpha-induced activation of NF-kappaB, as measured by a reporter assay, and the activation of endogenous p65, an NF-kappaB subunit. Surprisingly, there was no defect in the degradation of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) protein, nor was there any alteration in the level of p65 expression in HTNV N-expressing cells. However, immunofluorescence antibody staining demonstrated that cells expressing HTNV N protein and a green fluorescent protein-p65 fusion had limited p65 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, we were able to detect an interaction between HTNV N protein and importin alpha, a nuclear import molecule responsible for shuttling NF-kappaB to the nucleus. Collectively, our data suggest that HTNV N protein can sequester NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm, thus inhibiting NF-kappaB activity. These findings, which were obtained using cells transfected with cDNA representing the HTNV N gene, were confirmed using HTNV-infected cells.","Taylor, Shannon L; Frias-Staheli, Natalia; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Schmaljohn, Connie S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00986-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19019947/,383

DESIGN Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental conditions: control (n=225), or nutritional warnings (n=222). Nutritional warnings corresponded to separate black octagonal signs containing the word ""Excess"" followed by the corresponding nutrient: total fat, saturated fat, sugars and sodium. Participants were asked to purchase a lunch for themselves using a simulated food ordering website. SETTING Online study in Uruguay. PARTICIPANTS Convenience sample of 447 Uruguayan participants, recruited using social media. RESULTS In the control condition, 76% of the participants selected a dish or a beverage with excessive content of at least one nutrient in the simulated food ordering website. When nutritional warnings were included, this percentage significantly decreased to 62% (p=0.002). In addition, nutritional warnings caused a significant reduction in the percentage of participants who selected dishes with excessive content of total fat: 50% vs. 62% (p=0.012).

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Between July 2006 and February 2012, 713 patients underwent RFA for single HCC as a first-line treatment. Fifty-eight patients who showed LTP as initial tumour recurrence post-RFA treatment were included. Patients were treated with either repeated RFA (n=33) or TACE (n=25). TACE was performed as an alternative therapeutic option when repeated RFA was not feasible based on the planning ultrasonography. Recurrence-free and overall survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors for outcomes were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS Both groups did not show significant differences in terms of baseline characteristics, with the exception being the proportion of subphrenic tumours (p=0.031). The RFA and TACE groups did not differ significantly in their 5-year recurrence-free and overall survival rates (17% versus 10.7% and 72.7% versus 51.9%, respectively, with all p-values >0.05). In addition, multivariate analyses revealed that type of treatment was not associated with recurrence-free or overall survival in patients with post-RFA LTP. CONCLUSION TACE is an effective treatment, comparable to repeated RFA, in patients with LTP after initial RFA when repeated RFA is not feasible.","Kim, S S; Kang, T W; Kim, M; Lee, M W; Cho, S K; Paik, Y H; Kim, M-J",Clinical radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2017.07.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28859852/,383
88825,"[Abstracts of the National Online Congress with international participation ""Heart Failure 2020""].",2021-03-06,"Intravenous administration of siRNA nanocarriers may provide unique therapeutic opportunities for tissue-specific gene silencing. Although often engineered to overcome the numerous barriers that exist in the systemic circulation, many nanocarriers fail in extending the circulation time of the siRNA. A more detailed assessment of the different clearance mechanisms that are in play after intravenous injection could therefore be of value to improve siRNA nanocarrier design. In this report, the biodistribution in mice of siRNA loaded dextran nanogels was investigated in detail. Both single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and fluorescence single particle tracking (fSPT) indicate that the particles are rapidly cleared from the circulation. PEGylation of the nanogels was not able to increase the half-life in the bloodstream. Carrier disassembly in the systemic circulation and phagocytic clearance are known to facilitate the elimination of siRNA nanoparticles. Additionally, it is demonstrated for dextran nanogels that also the kidneys play an important role in their elimination from the bloodstream. SPECT imaging revealed an accumulation of the siRNA loaded dextran nanogels in the kidneys shortly after intravenous injection and a significantly delayed transition of siRNA from kidney to bladder, as opposed to the injection of free siRNA. These data indicate that components of the glomerular filtration barrier may contribute to the dissociation of siRNA from its carrier, as was recently suggested for cationic cyclodextrin siRNA polyplexes. This clearance mechanism should therefore be taken into account when designing siRNA nanocarriers for intravenous administration.","Naeye, Broes; Deschout, Hendrik; Caveliers, Vicky; Descamps, Benedicte; Braeckmans, Kevin; Vanhove, Christian; Demeester, Jo; Lahoutte, Tony; De Smedt, Stefaan C; Raemdonck, Koen",Biomaterials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.11.058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23261216/,383

If the arterial arrival times are longer than the post-labeling delay, labeled spins are visible on ASL images as bright, high intra-arterial signals (IASs); such signals were found within occluded vessels of patients with acute ischemic stroke. The identification of the occluded segment in the internal carotid artery (ICA) is crucial for endovascular treatment. We tested our hypothesis that high IASs on ASL images can predict the occluded segment. METHODS Our study included 13 patients with acute ICA occlusion who had undergone angiographic and ASL studies within 48 h of onset. We retrospectively identified the high IAS on ASL images and angiograms and recorded the occluded segment and the number of high IAS-positive slices on ASL images. The ICA segments were classified as cervical (C1), petrous (C2), cavernous (C3), and supraclinoid (C4). RESULTS Of seven patients with intracranial ICA occlusion, five demonstrated high IASs at C1-C2, suggesting that high IASs could identify stagnant flow proximal to the occluded segment. Among six patients with extracranial ICA occlusion, five presented with high IASs at C3-C4, suggesting that signals could identify the collateral flow via the ophthalmic artery. None had high IASs at C1-C2. The mean number of high IAS-positive slices was significantly higher in patients with intra- than extracranial ICA occlusion. CONCLUSION High IASs on ASL images can identify slow stagnant and collateral flow through the ophthalmic artery in patients with acute ICA occlusion and help to predict the occlusion site.","Sogabe, Shu; Satomi, Junichiro; Tada, Yoshiteru; Kanematsu, Yasuhisa; Kuwayama, Kazuyuki; Yagi, Kenji; Yoshioka, Shotaro; Mizobuchi, Yoshifumi; Mure, Hideo; Yamaguchi, Izumi; Abe, Takashi; Yamamoto, Nobuaki; Kitazato, Keiko T; Kaji, Ryuji; Harada, Masafumi; Nagahiro, Shinji",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-017-1828-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28397019/,383

Except for patients with unstable vital signs who require larger surgical incisions to check bleeding, this endoscopic surgery could be employed in the majority of thoracic injury patients with stable vital signs. RECENT FINDINGS In the past, VATS was used to evacuate traumatic-retained hemothorax. Recent study has revealed further that lung repair during VATS could decrease complications after trauma. Management of fractured ribs could also be assisted by VATS. Early VATS intervention within 7 days after injury can decrease the rate of posttraumatic infection and length of hospital stay. In studies of the pathophysiology of animal models, N-acetylcysteine and methylene blue were used in animals with blunt chest trauma and found to improve clinical outcomes. SUMMARY Retained hemothorax derived from blunt chest trauma should be managed carefully and rapidly.

Single rooted premolars contaminated with Enterococcus faecalis were chemomechanically prepared. Depending on the irrigation protocols, the roots were divided into the following groups: (1) distilled water during and after instrumentation; (2) 2.5% NaOCl during and after instrumentation; (3) 2.5% NaOCl/9% HEBP during and after instrumentation; and (4) 2.5% NaOCl during instrumentation followed by 17% EDTA after instrumentation. The percentage of dead cells and the biovolume in infected dentine tubules were measured using confocal laser scanning microscopy and the live/dead technique. Smear layer removal on root canal wall surfaces was observed by means of scanning electron microscopy. Results were compared through parametric tests (p < .05). The groups NaOCl, NaOCl/HEBP, and NaOCl+EDTA exerted the highest antimicrobial activity (p > .05), followed by the group irrigated with water. All the irrigation protocols-including water-significantly reduced the bacteria biovolume. No dentine tubules free of smear layer were found in the positive control or the 2.5% NaOCl group.

This transformation from sensation to perception is thought to be a major function of the mammalian cortex. In primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of mice, layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons are major outputs to downstream areas that influence perception, decision-making, and motor control. We investigated self-motion and touch representations in L5 of S1 with juxtacellular loose-seal patch recordings of optogenetically identified excitatory neurons. We found that during rhythmic whisker movement, 54 of 115 active neurons (47%) represented self-motion. This population was significantly more modulated by whisker angle than by phase. Upon active touch, a distinct pattern of activity was evoked across L5, which represented the whisker angle at the time of touch. Object location was decodable with submillimeter precision from the touch-evoked spike counts of a randomly sampled handful of these neurons. These representations of whisker angle during self-motion and touch were independent, both in the selection of which neurons were active and in the angle-tuning preference of coactive neurons. Thus, the output of S1 transiently shifts from a representation of self-motion to an independent representation of explored object location during active touch.","Cheung, Jonathan Andrew; Maire, Phillip; Kim, Jinho; Lee, Kiana; Flynn, Garrett; Hires, Samuel Andrew",PLoS biology,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141817/,383

Data for this research come from a cross-sectional quantitative study including 1,814 individuals (907 chronically-ill elderly patients and their 907 companions). Data were collected through two online questionnaires, one for patients and one for companions. The findings suggest that companion health empowerment is defined by the dimensions information search empowerment and knowledge development and decision participation empowerment. Furthermore, the distinction between functional, interactive and critical health literacy has revealed to be useful for comprehending companion health literacy. A structural equation model shows that critical health literacy sets the threshold above which companion health literacy improves accompanied patient well-being, even more so when it is backed up by companion information search empowerment and by companion knowledge development and decision participation empowerment.","Suárez Vázquez, Ana; Suárez Álvarez, Leticia; Del Río Lanza, Ana Belén",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1862398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33334179/,383

METHODS (89)Zr was conjugated to fresolimumab using the chelator N-succinyldesferrioxamine-B-tetrafluorphenol. (89)Zr-fresolimumab was analyzed for conjugation ratio, aggregation, radiochemical purity, stability, and immunoreactivity. (89)Zr-fresolimumab tumor uptake and organ distribution were assessed using 3 protein doses (10, 50, and 100 μg) and compared with (111)In-IgG in a human TGF-β-transfected Chinese hamster ovary xenograft model, human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 xenograft, and metastatic model. Latent and active TGF-β1 expression was analyzed in tissue homogenates with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS (89)Zr was labeled to fresolimumab with high specific activity (>1 GBq/mg), high yield, and high purity. In vitro validation of (89)Zr-fresolimumab showed a fully preserved immunoreactivity and long (>1 wk) stability in solution and in human serum. In vivo validation showed an (89)Zr-fresolimumab distribution similar to IgG in most organs, except for a higher uptake in the liver in all mice and higher kidney uptake in the 10-μg group. (89)Zr-fresolimumab induced no toxicity in mice; it accumulated in primary tumors and metastases in a manner similar to IgG. Both latent and active TGF-β was detected in tumor homogenates, whereas only latent TGF-β could be detected in liver homogenates. Remarkably high (89)Zr-fresolimumab uptake was seen in sites of tumor ulceration and in scar tissue, processes in which TGF-β is known to be highly active.

Methods: Measurements of BP and heart rate (HR) were obtained from persons living in the Paris urban area using connected home BP monitors (accessible to patients and health providers through a secured server). Three time periods of e-health recordings were compared: during the pandemic before the lockdown, during the lockdown, and the same time period in 2019. Results: A total of 297,089 BP recordings from 2,273 participants (age 56.3 ± 12.8 years, 81.1% male) were made. During confinement, systolic BP gradually decreased by 3 mmHg (-2.4 to -3.9), and diastolic BP by 1.5 mmHg (-1.4 to -2.2) (all p < 0.001); this decrease was greater for participants with higher BP (p < 0.0001 each). No significant variation in HR was noted. Conclusion: Among a very large cohort, we observed a significant decrease in home BP measured with e-health devices during the first lockdown period.

96529,"The actual and potential impact of the novel 2019 coronavirus on pediatric rehabilitation: A commentary and review of its effects and potential disparate influence on Black, Latinx and Native American marginalized populations in the United States.",2020-07-17,"Rock glaciers are capable of storing water in solid (permafrost ice) as well as in liquid form (groundwater within the unfrozen base layer). The latter is relevant no matter the actual state of the rock glacier (intact, containing ice versus relict, no more ice present). A nation-wide comparison of the water equivalent of glacier ice within the Austrian Alps is conducted to evaluate the role of rock glaciers in the hydrological cycle at its current state and potentially in the future. Estimates of ice volumes and their uncertainties, especially related to thickness estimates of permafrost-ice bodies, are discussed in the light of available data and need to be seen as order-of-magnitude estimates. With intact rock glaciers covering almost 123 km2 and an assumed ice content of 40% within the permafrost body, ice volumes are estimated to be 0.93 Gigatons. This corresponds to 8.3% of the ice volume estimated for the most recent glacier inventory of the Austrian Alps. Thus, with the currently available data, a water equivalent ratio of ~1: 12 for rock glacier ice versus glacier ice is estimated. In addition to the solid water storage, the dynamic storage potential within rock glaciers in liquid form needs to be considered. While this volume is relatively small compared to the ice volume in glaciers and rock glaciers (ratio of ~1: 20), the time-scales of hydrological relevance (when they become runoff due to ice melt) are very different. This dynamic liquid water storage is replenishable and therefore available over shorter time scales (seasonal drainage pattern), and moreover relatively stable and may potentially even slightly increase as pore space becomes available due to increased melting of permafrost ice. In the light of climate warming and projected glacier recession, the relative hydrological importance of rock glaciers as water stores (in solid as well as in liquid form) in the European Alps is expected to increase and their storage-discharge patterns need to be accounted for in water management considerations.","Wagner, Thomas; Kainz, Simon; Helfricht, Kay; Fischer, Andrea; Avian, Michael; Krainer, Karl; Winkler, Gerfried",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399338/,383

METHODS In the current multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients aged ≥2 months and <22 years with cancer or those undergoing allogeneic HCT were randomized 1:1 to once-daily bathing with 2% CHG-impregnated cloths or control cloths for 90 days. The primary outcome was CLABSI. Secondary endpoints included total positive blood cultures, acquisition of resistant organisms, and acquisition of cutaneous staphylococcal isolates with an elevated CHG mean inhibitory concentration. RESULTS The study was stopped early because of poor accrual. Among the 177 enrolled patients, 174 were considered as evaluable (88 were randomized to the CHG group and 86 were randomized to the control group). The rate of CLABSI per 1000 central line days in the CHG group was 5.44 versus 3.10 in the control group (risk difference, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-4.69 [P = .049]). Post hoc conditional power analysis demonstrated a 0.2% chance that the results would have favored CHG had the study fully enrolled. The rate of total positive blood cultures did not differ between groups (risk difference, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, -0.41 to 5.14 [P = .078]). The number of patients demonstrating the new acquisition of resistant organisms did not differ between groups (P = .54). Patients in the CHG group were found to be more likely to acquire cutaneous staphylococcal isolates with an elevated CHG mean inhibitory concentration (P = .032). CONCLUSIONS The data from the current study do not support the use of routine CHG bathing in children with cancer or those undergoing allogeneic HCT.","Zerr, Danielle M; Milstone, Aaron M; Dvorak, Christopher C; Adler, Amanda L; Chen, Lu; Villaluna, Doojduen; Dang, Ha; Qin, Xuan; Addetia, Amin; Yu, Lolie C; Conway Keller, Mary; Esbenshade, Adam J; August, Keith J; Fisher, Brian T; Sung, Lillian",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079403/,383

The Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV), the most prevalent orthohantavirus in Western Europe, causes a mild form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. In France, this endemic illness affects the north-eastern part of the country. We conducted a 4-year capture-mark-recapture study in a bank vole population, combined with molecular analyses, to explore the epidemiological situation of PUUV in Alsace, a French region where human cases have occurred, but for which no studies have been conducted on this reservoir host. PUUV-infected bank voles were detected in the 2 years that showed high bank vole density with a prevalence of 4%. The individual PUUV sequences identified in this study were similar from year to year and similar to other French sequences. On a very small spatial scale, the distribution of seropositive bank voles was very heterogeneous in time and space. The short distances travelled on average by bank voles resulted in spatial clusters of seropositive rodents, which spread only very gradually throughout the year.","Monchatre-Leroy, E; Murri, S; Castel, G; Calavas, D; Boué, F; Hénaux, V; Marianneau, P",Zoonoses and public health,https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29577655/,383
99465,Clinical presentation and course of COVID-19.,2020-05-05,"BACKGROUND The inflammatory response to surgical tissue injury is associated with perioperative morbidity and mortality. We tested the primary hypotheses that major perioperative morbidity is reduced by three potential anti-inflammatory interventions: (i) low-dose dexamethasone, (ii) intensive intraoperative glucose control, and (iii) lighter anaesthesia. METHODS We enrolled patients having major non-cardiac surgery who were ≥40 yr old and had an ASA physical status ≤IV. In a three-way factorial design, patients were randomized to perioperative i.v. dexamethasone (a total of 14 mg tapered over 3 days) vs placebo, intensive vs conventional glucose control 80-110 vs 180-200 mg dl(-1), and lighter vs deeper anaesthesia (bispectral index target of 55 vs 35). The primary outcome was a collapsed composite of 15 major complications and 30 day mortality. Plasma high-sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration was measured before operation and on the first and second postoperative days. RESULTS The overall incidence of the primary outcome was about 20%. The trial was stopped after the second interim analysis with 381 patients, at which all three interventions crossed the futility boundary for the primary outcome. No three-way (P=0.70) or two-way (all P>0.52) interactions among the interventions were found. There was a significantly smaller increase in hsCRP in patients given dexamethasone than placebo [maximum 108 (64) vs 155 (69) mg litre(-1), P<0.001], but none of the other two interventions differentially influenced the hsCRP response to surgery. CONCLUSIONS Among our three interventions, dexamethasone alone reduced inflammation. However, no intervention reduced the risk of major morbidity or 1 yr mortality.

99480,Evaluation of Patient Perceptions With Orthopedic Oncology Telehealth: A Pilot Project.,2020-12-01,"An important bottleneck for non-viral gene transfer commonly relates to translocation of nucleic acids into the nuclear compartment of target cells. So-called 3NFs are optimized short nucleotide sequences able to interact with the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), which can enhance the nuclear import of plasmid DNA (pDNA) carrying such motifs. In this work, we first designed a consistent set of six pDNAs featuring a common backbone and only varying in their 3NF sequences. These constructions were then transfected under various experimental settings. In vitro, cationic polymer-assisted pDNA delivery in five human-derived cell lines showed the potential advantage of 3NF carrying pDNA in diverse cellular contexts. In vivo, naked pDNAs were hydrodynamically delivered to muscle hindlimbs in healthy mice; this direct accurate comparative (in the absence of any gene carrier) revealed modest but consistent trends in favor of the pDNAs equipped with 3NF. In summary, the results reported emphasize the implications of various parameters on NF-κB-mediated pDNA nuclear import; under specific conditions, 3NF can provide modest to substantial advantages for pDNA gene transfer, in vitro as well as in vivo. This study thus further underscores the potential of optimized nuclear import for more efficient non-viral gene transfer applications.","Le Guen, Yann T; Pichon, Chantal; Guégan, Philippe; Pluchon, Kévin; Haute, Tanguy; Quemener, Sandrine; Ropars, Juliette; Midoux, Patrick; Le Gall, Tony; Montier, Tristan",Molecular therapy.

This paper aims to provide insight into shifts in alcohol consumption and associated factors during the epidemic. DESIGN AND METHODS A cross-sectional convenience sample of 2307 Australians aged 18 and over who drank at least monthly was recruited through social media. Respondents were asked about their alcohol consumption and purchasing in 2019 prior to the epidemic plus similar questions about their experiences in the month prior to being surveyed between 29 April and 16 May 2020. RESULTS Reports of average consumption before (3.53 drinks per day [3.36, 3.71 95% confidence interval]) and during (3.52 [3.34, 3.69]) the pandemic were stable. However, young men and those who drank more outside the home in 2019 reported decreased consumption during the pandemic, and people with high levels of stress and those who bulk-bought alcohol when restrictions were announced reported an increase in consumption relative to those who did not. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS A reported increase in consumption among those experiencing more stress suggests that some people may have been drinking to cope during the epidemic. Conversely, the reported decrease in consumption among those who drank more outside of their home in 2019 suggests that closing all on-trade sales did not result in complete substitution of on-premise drinking with home drinking in this group. Monitoring of relevant subgroups to assess long-term changes in consumption in the aftermath of the epidemic is recommended.","Callinan, Sarah; Mojica-Perez, Yvette; Wright, Cassandra J C; Livingston, Michael; Kuntsche, Sandra; Laslett, Anne-Marie; Room, Robin; Kuntsche, Emmanuel",Drug and alcohol review,https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.13200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33170976/,383

Further, colistin has been also used to prevent and treat Enterobacteriaceae infections in food animals. However, chromosomal mutations and mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes, which confer resistance to colistin, have been detected in bacterial isolates from food animals and humans worldwide; thus, limiting the use of colistin. Therefore, strategies that could aid in ameliorating colistin resistance are critically needed. Objective Investigate the adjuvant potential of novel small molecules (SMs) on colistin. Materials and Methods Previously, we identified 11 membrane-affecting SMs with bactericidal activity against avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC). Here, we investigated the potentiation effect of those SMs on colistin using checkerboard assays and wax moth (Galleria mellonella) larval model. The impact of the SM combination on colistin resistance evolution was also investigated by analyzing whole genome sequences of APEC isolates passaged with colistin alone or in combination with SMs followed by quantitating pmrCAB and pmrH expression in those isolates. Results The SM combination synergistically reduced the minimum bactericidal concentration of colistin by at least 10-fold. In larvae, the SM combination increased the efficacy of colistin by two-fold with enhanced (>50%) survival and reduced (>4 logs) APEC load. Further, the SM combination decreased the frequency (5/6 to 1/6) of colistin resistance evolution and downregulated the pmrCAB and pmrH expression. Previously unknown mutations in pmrB (L14Q, T92P) and pmrA (A80V), which were predicted deleterious, were identified in the colistin-resistant (ColR) APEC isolates when passaged with colistin alone but not in combination with SMs. Our study also identified mutations in hypothetical and several phage-related proteins in ColR APEC isolates in concurrent with pmrAB mutations. Conclusion Our study identified two SMs (SM2 and SM3) that potentiated the colistin activity and attenuated the development of colistin resistance in APEC. These SMs can be developed as anti-evolution drugs that can slow down colistin resistance development.","Kathayat, Dipak; Antony, Linto; Deblais, Loic; Helmy, Yosra A; Scaria, Joy; Rajashekara, Gireesh",Infection and drug resistance,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s260766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764996/,383

101349,Is the COVID-19 Emergency an Opportunity to Reshape Assistance Models for the Future of Maxillofacial Surgery?,2020,"BACKGROUND Maintaining adequate perioperative hepatic blood flow (HBF) supply is essential for preservation of postoperative normal liver function. Propofol and sevoflurane affect arterial and portal HBF. Previous studies have suggested that propofol increases total HBF, primarily by increasing portal HBF, while sevoflurane has only minimal effect on total HBF. Primary objective was to compare the effect of propofol (group P) and sevoflurane (group S) on arterial, portal and total HBF and on the caval and portal vein pressure during major abdominal surgery. The study was performed in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy because - in contrast to hepatic surgical procedures - this is a standardized surgical procedure without potential anticipated severe hemodynamic disturbances, and it allows direct access to the hepatic blood vessels. METHODS Patients were randomized according to the type of anesthetic drug used. For both groups, Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring was used to monitor depth of anesthesia. All patients received goal-directed hemodynamic therapy (GDHT) guided by the transpulmonary thermodilution technique. Hemodynamic data were measured, recorded and guided by Pulsioflex™. Arterial, portal and total HBF were measured directly, using ultrasound transit time flow measurements (TTFM) and were related to hemodynamic variables. RESULTS Eighteen patients were included. There was no significant difference between groups in arterial, portal and total HBF. As a result of the GDHT, pre-set hemodynamic targets were obtained in both groups, but MAP was significantly lower in group S (p = 0.01). In order to obtain these pre-set hemodynamic targets, group S necessitated a significantly higher need for vasopressor support (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION Hepatic blood flow was similar under a propofol-based and a sevoflurane-based anesthetic regimen. Related to the application of GDHT, pre-set hemodynamic goals were maintained in both groups, but sevoflurane-anaesthetized patients had a significantly higher need for vasopressor support.

Their surgical excision is often difficult because of their anatomic location. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of straight laparoscopic resection of RTs in our institution. METHODS Eight patients (six women and two men) with benign RTs were treated by laparoscopic resection in our tertiary care center between September 2012 and June 2013. Exclusion criteria included malignant tumors, lesions with fistula formation, and anterior sacral meningoceles. Clinical data, imaging features, operative details, pathological results, and treatment outcomes were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS Eight cases of benign RT with an average diameter of 8.9 ± 1.7 cm were treated by a straight laparoscopic procedure. The mean operative time was 122 ± 36 min, and the average intraoperative blood loss was 46 ± 33 ml. The median postoperative stay was 5 days (range 3-8 days), and all patients were discharged without serious complications. During a median follow-up of 11 months, no tumor recurrence was observed. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, a laparoscopic approach is safe for removing benign tumors in the retrorectal space. This approach may provide access to this difficult-to-reach space and has the advantages of allowing excellent visualization, meticulous dissection, less morbidities, and fast recuperation.","Zhou, J L; Wu, B; Xiao, Y; Lin, G L; Wang, W Z; Zhang, G N; Qiu, H Z",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-014-1146-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24718777/,383

Our aim was to evaluate the relationship of the quantitative collateral score on baseline CTA with the outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke and test whether the timing of the CTA acquisition influences this relationship. MATERIALS AND METHODS From the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) data base, all baseline thin-slice CTA images of patients with acute ischemic stroke with intracranial large-vessel occlusion were retrospectively collected. The quantitative collateral score was calculated as the ratio of the vascular appearance of both hemispheres and was compared with the visual collateral score. Primary outcomes were 90-day mRS score and follow-up infarct volume. The relation with outcome and the association with treatment effect were estimated. The influence of the CTA acquisition phase on the relation of collateral scores with outcome was determined. RESULTS A total of 442 patients were included. The quantitative collateral score strongly correlated with the visual collateral score (ρ = 0.75) and was an independent predictor of mRS (adjusted odds ratio = 0.81; 95% CI, .77-.86) and follow-up infarct volume (exponent β = 0.88; P < .001) per 10% increase. The quantitative collateral score showed areas under the curve of 0.71 and 0.69 for predicting functional independence (mRS 0-2) and follow-up infarct volume of >90 mL, respectively. We found significant interaction of the quantitative collateral score with the endovascular therapy effect in unadjusted analysis on the full ordinal mRS scale (P = .048) and on functional independence (P = .049). Modification of the quantitative collateral score by acquisition phase on outcome was significant (mRS: P = .004; follow-up infarct volume: P < .001) in adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS Automated quantitative collateral scoring in patients with acute ischemic stroke is a reliable and user-independent measure of the collateral capacity on baseline CTA and has the potential to augment the triage of patients with acute stroke for endovascular therapy.","Boers, A M M; Sales Barros, R; Jansen, I G H; Berkhemer, O A; Beenen, L F M; Menon, B K; Dippel, D W J; van der Lugt, A; van Zwam, W H; Roos, Y B W E M; van Oostenbrugge, R J; Slump, C H; Majoie, C B L M; Marquering, H A",AJNR.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of interferon (IFN) with or without lopinavir and ritonavir as antiviral therapeutic option for treating COVID-19 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS The present study enrolled 148 patients that received either standard care, treatment with IFN alfa-2b, or IFN alfa-2b combined with lopinavir plus ritonavir. Viral testing was performed using Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS There was no significant difference in the viral-clearance time at 28 days after treatment between patients receiving standard care and those receiving anti-viral treatments. However, the average viral-clearance time of patients receiving standard care (14 days) was shorter than that for patients receiving IFN alfa-2b or IFN alfa-2b combined with lopinavir plus ritonavir (15.5 or 17.5 days) (p<0.05). Patients treated with IFN alfa-2b within five days or IFN alfa-2b combined with lopinavir plus ritonavir after three days of symptoms exhibited shorter viral-clearance times than the other groups (p<0.05). Moreover, viral-clearance times were significantly longer in patients receiving standard care or anti-viral treatment 5 days after symptoms appeared than those of patients who received these treatments within five days of symptom onset (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Early symptomatic treatment is most critical for maximizing amelioration of COVID-19 infection. Anti-viral treatment might have complicated effect on viral-clearance.","Liu, J-Y; Hua, M-X; Du, C-J; Pu, L; Xiang, P; Li, C-S; Xiong, H-F; Liu, X-Z; Chen, Z-H; Xie, W; Li, A",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202011_23854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275267/,383

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate arrhythmia in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 during the current COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for case control studies that were published between January 1 and July 25, 2020, and that had data on arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19. Random effects model was used with the odds ratio as the effect size. The frequency of arrhythmia was compared between COVID-19 patients with and without the composite endpoint of severity. We also determined the pooled prevalence of arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19. Publication bias and heterogeneity were considered by using subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and the trim and fill method. RESULTS A total of 1553 patients with COVID-19 were included in the 5 articles we obtained. Of these, 349 cases (22.47%) and 1204 cases (77.53%) were severely ill and non-severely ill inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia, respectively. There were 790 (50.87%) male patients. A total of 105 cases (30.09%) of severely ill inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia had arrhythmia complications, and 34 cases (2.82%) of non-severely ill inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia had arrhythmia complications. We found arrhythmia to be significantly associated with severely ill inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia, with a pooled odds ratio of 17.97 (95% CI (11.30, 28.55), p<0.00001). CONCLUSIONS This study showed that the incidence of arrhythmia in patients with severe COVID-19 was greater than that of those with non-severe COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 had a higher risk of arrhythmia complications, which further showed that COVID-19 may be a risk factor for arrhythmia and that the incidence of arrhythmia may increase with the progression of the disease.

Exacerbations of asthma are an important component of risk but have not received as much attention as the day-to-day symptoms that make up impairment. The purpose of this review is to report what has recently been learned about exacerbations. RECENT FINDINGS Exacerbations occur in the context of both controlled and uncontrolled asthma. Exacerbations are a strong independent risk factor of further exacerbations. This suggests that unrecognized factors may be involved in susceptibility to exacerbations in addition to more commonly recognized triggers such as viruses, allergens, and poorly controlled asthma. Such factors may be the result of genetic variation. Recent evidence now shows a residual effect on lung function from an exacerbation event. There are no current specific intervention measures to prevent exacerbations but attention to management practices continues to look at the role of the emergency department in improving care. SUMMARY The presence of exacerbations is considered a risk factor of the likelihood of further exacerbations and requires assessment of the triggers identified with history of exacerbations, host factors, atopic disposition, exposure to allergens, adherence to prescribed medications, and preventive measures to reduce future risk of such an event.","Bloomberg, Gordon R",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aci.0b013e328335ce60; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20010093/,383
108965,Rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients.,2020-04-14,"BACKGROUND Tandem intracranial aneurysms are aneurysms located along a single intracranial vessel. Adjacent tandem aneurysms arise within the same vascular segment and their presence often suggests diffuse parent vessel anomaly. Endovascular management of these rare lesions has not been well studied. In this retrospective observational study, we describe our experience treating adjacent tandem intracranial aneurysms with endovascular embolization. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed records of patients with these lesions who underwent endovascular treatment between 2008 and 2013. RESULTS Thirteen patients (mean age 60.8 years; 12 women) with 28 adjacent tandem aneurysms were treated during the study timeframe. Aneurysms were located along the clinoidal, ophthalmic, and communicating segments of the internal carotid artery in 12 patients and at the basilar apex in one patient. Average size was 8.4 mm. Six patients (12 aneurysms) were treated by flow diversion via the Pipeline embolization device (PED) and seven (16 aneurysms) by stent-assisted coiling, with coils successfully placed in 11 aneurysms. Clinical follow-up was available for an average of 26.1 months; postprocedural angiography was performed for 12 patients. Complete occlusion was achieved in nine of ten (90 %) PED-treated aneurysms and eight of 11 (72.7 %) treated by stent-assisted coiling (p = 0.44). Two patients treated by stent-assisted coiling required re-coiling for aneurysm recanalization. Overall, modified Rankin scale scores were 0-1 for 12 patients and 3 for one patient. CONCLUSIONS Adjacent tandem intracranial aneurysms can be safely and effectively treated by either stent-assisted coiling or flow diversion. We prefer PED flow diversion due to better parent vessel reconstruction and lower recanalization risk.","Lin, Ning; Brouillard, Adam M; Xiang, Jianping; Sonig, Ashish; Mokin, Maxim; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Krishna, Chandan; Hopkins, L Nelson; Snyder, Kenneth V; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-014-2318-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25572632/,383

The mechanisms driving this chronic inflammation are not well understood. Here, we detail the effects of myelin debris on macrophage physiology and demonstrate a novel, activation state-dependent role for cytosolic phospholipase-A2 (cPLA2) in myelin-mediated potentiation of pro-inflammatory macrophage activation. We hypothesized that cPLA2 and myelin debris are key mediators of persistent pro-inflammatory macrophage responses after SCI. To test this, we examined spinal cord tissue 28-days after thoracic contusion SCI in 3-month-old female mice and observed both cPLA2 activation and intracellular accumulation of lipid-rich myelin debris in macrophages. In vitro, we utilized bone marrow-derived macrophages to determine myelin's effects across a spectrum of activation states. We observed phenotype-specific responses with myelin potentiating only pro-inflammatory (LPS + INF-γ; M1) macrophage activation, whereas myelin did not induce pro-inflammatory responses in unstimulated or anti-inflammatory (IL-4; M2) macrophages. Specifically, myelin increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide production in M1 macrophages as well as M1-mediated neurotoxicity. PACOCF3 (cPLA2 inhibitor) blocked myelin's detrimental effects. Collectively, we provide novel spatiotemporal evidence that myelin and cPLA2 play an important role in the pathophysiology of SCI inflammation and the phenotype-specific response to myelin implicate diverse roles of myelin in neuroinflammatory conditions.","Kopper, Timothy J; Zhang, Bei; Bailey, William M; Bethel, Kara E; Gensel, John C",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85863-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737707/,383

Materials and Methods Sixty patients with unresectable or metastatic GBC having ongoing response to treatment with initial six cycles of gemcitabine and a platinum-based doublet chemotherapy were prospectively randomized on day 21 of the 6th cycle in 1:1 fashion to receive either maintenance gemcitabine 1 g/m 2 intravenously on day 1 and day 8 of three weekly cycle or observation. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and comparisons by the log-rank test. A p -value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results Of 60 patients, a total of 56 were available for final analysis. The median PFS was 4.7 months (3.1-6.3) in gemcitabine arm and 2.6 months (2.4-2.8) in observation arm, hazard ratio (HR) 0.196 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.1-0.39), p < 0.001. Median overall survival in gemcitabine arm was 12.4 months (9.15-15.6) as opposed to 9.9 months (8.29-11.5) in observation arm, HR 0.76 (95% CI: 0.43-1.35), p = 0.354. The grade 3 or 4 side effects in maintenance arm were transaminitis (17.9%), thrombocytopenia (17.8%), neutropenia (14.2%), and febrile neutropenia (7.1%).

Specimens were collected from hospitalized children with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI), and the hMPV was detected by using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The full-length G gene of hMPV was amplified by RT-PCR. A total of 1,410 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from April 2008 to March 2011, and 114 (10.2%) were positive for hMPV. Most hMPV-positive children were <5 years of age. The hMPV infection rate peaked in the spring-summer season of 2008 to 2009 and 2009 to 2010, while hMPV circulated predominantly during the winter-spring season of 2010 to 2011. The full-length G gene of 23 hMPV strains was amplified, and group A and B viruses accounted for 95.7% (22/23) and 4.3% (1/23), respectively. Genotype A2b of hMPV appeared to be predominant during the study period. Three genotypes (A2b, A1, and B1) were prevalent in the epidemic season of 2008 to 2009, and only genotype A2b was identified in the other two seasons (2009 to 2010 and 2010 to 2011). The G gene of hMPV was predicted to encode proteins with four different lengths, in which one with 210 amino acids was first identified in China. These findings suggest that hMPV was an important pathogen of ALRTI in pediatric patients, especially those <5 years of age. Genotype A2b of hMPV likely predominates in Southwest China, where other genotypes also circulate.","Zhang, Cui; Du, Li-Na; Zhang, Zhi-Yong; Qin, Xian; Yang, Xi; Liu, Ping; Chen, Xin; Zhao, Yao; Liu, En-Mei; Zhao, Xiao-Dong",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00809-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22692746/,383

This study evaluated the role of eosinopenia as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator in COVID-19 infection. METHODS Information on 429 patients with confirmed COVID-19, admitted to Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, India between 04 June 2020 to 15 August 2020, was retrospectively collected through electronic records and analysed. RESULTS 79.25% of the patients included in the study had eosinopenia on admission. The median eosinophil count in COVID-19-positive patients was 0.015 × 109 /L, and in negative patients, it was 0.249 × 109 /L. Eighteen per cent of the positive patients presented with 0 eosinophil count. Eosinopenia for early diagnosis of COVID-19 had a sensitivity of 80.68% and specificity of 100% with an accuracy of 85.24. Role of eosinopenia in prognostication of COVID-19 was found to be insignificant. There was no statistically significant difference between the median eosinophil counts in survivors and nonsurvivors. Eosinophil trends during the course of disease were found to be similar between survivors and nonsurvivors. CONCLUSIONS Eosinopenia on admission is a reliable and convenient early diagnostic marker for COVID-19 infection, helping in early identification, triaging and isolation of the patients till nucleic acid test results are available. Role of eosinopenia as a prognostic indicator is insignificant.","Soni, Mamta",International journal of laboratory hematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijlh.13425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33289964/,383
111136,Insights into the Immunopathophysiology of Severe COVID-19 in Metabolic Disorders.,2020-04-01,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful model system for systems-wide biology screens and large-scale proteomics methods. Nearly complete proteomics coverage has been achieved owing to advances in mass spectrometry. However, it remains challenging to scale this technology for rapid and high-throughput analysis of the yeast proteome to investigate biological pathways on a global scale. Here we describe a systems biology workflow employing plate-based sample preparation and rapid, single-run, data-independent mass spectrometry analysis (DIA). Our approach is straightforward, easy to implement, and enables quantitative profiling and comparisons of hundreds of nearly complete yeast proteomes in only a few days. We evaluate its capability by characterizing changes in the yeast proteome in response to environmental perturbations, identifying distinct responses to each of them and providing a comprehensive resource of these responses. Apart from rapidly recapitulating previously observed responses, we characterized carbon source-dependent regulation of the GID E3 ligase, an important regulator of cellular metabolism during the switch between gluconeogenic and glycolytic growth conditions. This unveiled regulatory targets of the GID ligase during a metabolic switch. Our comprehensive yeast system readout pinpointed effects of a single deletion or point mutation in the GID complex on the global proteome, allowing the identification and validation of targets of the GID E3 ligase. Moreover, this approach allowed the identification of targets from multiple cellular pathways that display distinct patterns of regulation. Although developed in yeast, rapid whole-proteome-based readouts can serve as comprehensive systems-level assays in all cellular systems.","Karayel, Ozge; Michaelis, André C; Mann, Matthias; Schulman, Brenda A; Langlois, Christine R",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2020197117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33288721/,383

Serum was collected from each bat and assayed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) using six flaviviruses: West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and dengue viruses 1-4. Flavivirus-specific antibodies were detected in 26 bats (19%). The antibody-positive bats belonged to three species: the Pallas's long-tongued bat (Glossophaga soricina), Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis), and great fruit-eating bat (Artibeus lituratus), and their flavivirus antibody prevalences were 33%, 24%, and 9%, respectively. The PRNT titers were usually highest for dengue virus 2 or dengue virus 4, but none of the titers exceeded 80. These data could indicate that most of the antibody-positive bats had been infected with dengue virus. However, because all titers were low, it is possible that the bats had been infected with another (perhaps unrecognized) flavivirus not included in the PRNT analysis, possibly a virus more closely related to dengue virus than to other flaviviruses. Each serum sample was assayed for flavivirus RNA by reverse transcription PCR, but all were negative.","Machain-Williams, Carlos; López-Uribe, Mildred; Talavera-Aguilar, Lourdes; Carrillo-Navarrete, Jaquelin; Vera-Escalante, Luis; Puerto-Manzano, Fernando; Ulloa, Armando; Farfán-Ale, José Arturo; Garcia-Rejon, Julián; Blitvich, Bradley J; Loroño-Pino, María Alba",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://doi.org/10.7589/2012-12-318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23778622/,383
112504,Cardiac tamponade as a cause of COVID-19.,2020,"Actin and myosin mediate the epidermal cell contractions that elongate the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo from an ovoid to a tubular-shaped worm. Contraction occurs mainly in the lateral epidermal cells, while the dorsoventral epidermis plays a more passive role. Two parallel pathways trigger actinomyosin contraction, one mediated by LET-502/Rho kinase and the other by PAK-1/p21 activated kinase. A number of genes mediating morphogenesis have been shown to be sufficient when expressed either laterally or dorsoventrally. Additional genes show either lateral or dorsoventral phenotypes. This led us to a model where contractile genes have discrete functions in one or the other cell type. We tested this by examining several genes for either lateral or dorsoventral sufficiency. LET-502 expression in the lateral cells was sufficient to drive elongation. MEL-11/Myosin phosphatase, which antagonizes contraction, and PAK-1 were expected to function dorsoventrally, but we could not detect tissue-specific sufficiency. Double mutants of lethal alleles predicted to decrease lateral contraction with those thought to increase dorsoventral force were previously shown to be viable. We hypothesized that these mutant combinations shifted the contractile force from the lateral to the dorsoventral cells and so the embryos would elongate with less lateral cell contraction. This was tested by examining ten single and double mutant strains. In most cases, elongation proceeded without a noticeable alteration in lateral contraction. We suggest that many embryonic elongation genes likely act in both lateral and dorsoventral cells, even though they may have their primary focus in one or the other cell type.","Drewnik, Elizabeth D; Wiesenfahrt, Tobias; Smit, Ryan B; Park, Ye-Jean; Pallotto, Linda M; Mains, Paul E",G3,https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkab164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974063/,383

METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study of all adult patients in England diagnosed with obesity and undergoing bariatric surgery as a primary procedure in NHS-funded sites between April 2006 and March 2012 using data sourced from the Hospital Episode Statistics dataset. Length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission, and post-surgery complication were analyzed as primary outcomes. Socio-demographic background, provider type, procedure volume, and comorbidities were all analyzed as potential explanatory variables. RESULTS Gastric bypass (GBP, 12,628) was the most utilized procedure, followed by gastric banding (GB, 6872) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG, 3251). The most prevalent comorbidity was type 2 diabetes (23%). Inpatient mortality was low (≤ 0.15%) for all procedure types. LOS and the risks of both post-operative complication and 30-day readmission were significantly lower for GB, relative to those for GBP and SG. Ethnicity, geographical area, surgery type, and volume were all associated with LOS, risk of readmission, and complication. Provider type and deprivation were further associated with LOS while age correlated with readmission only. An increasing comorbidity burden was associated with an increased risk of both readmission and complication. CONCLUSIONS Gastric bypass was the most frequently reported procedure in England across the observation period. While utilization across all procedure types increased between 2007 and 2010, overall uptake of bariatric surgery in England represents only a small proportion of the eligible population. Readmission and complication rates were lower for gastric banding relative to those for either gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. The observed inpatient mortality rate was low across all procedure types.","Sun, Sun; Borisenko, Oleg; Spelman, Tim; Ahmed, Ahmed R",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-017-2978-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29076010/,383

Despite the existing triaging strategy at the Obstetric unit of a tertiary hospital in New Delhi, where all COVID-19 suspects obstetric patients were tested and admitted in orange zone and non-suspects in green zone, asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients were found admitted in the green zone. This was the trigger to undertake a quality improvement (QI) initiative to prevent the admission of asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients in green zones. The QI project aimed at reducing the admission of COVID-19 positive patients in the green zone of the unit from 20% to 10% in 4 weeks' time starting 13/6/2020 by means of dynamic triaging. A COVID-19 action team was made and after an initial analysis of the problem multiple Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles were run to test the change ideas. The main change ideas were revised testing strategies and creating gray Zones for patients awaiting COVID-19 test results. The admission of unsuspected COVID-19 positive cases in the green zone of the unit reduced from 20% to 0% during the stipulated period. There was a significant reduction in the number of HCWs, posted in the green zone, being quarantined or test positive for COVID-19 infection as well.

Intramuscular (IM) delivery can be preferred to intravenous delivery when initiating intravenous access is difficult or impossible. Drugs can be injected intramuscularly using a syringe or an automated delivery device (autoinjector). Investigation into the IM delivery dynamics of these methods may guide further improvements in the performance of injection technologies. Two porcine model studies were conducted to compare differences in dispersion of injectate volume for different methods of IM drug administration. The first study compared the differences in the degree of dispersion and uptake of injectate following the use of a manual syringe and an autoinjector. The second study compared the spatial spread of the injected formulation, or dispersion volume, and uptake of injectate following the use of five different autoinjectors (EpiPen(®) [0.3 mL], EpiPen(®) Jr [0.3 mL], Twinject(®) [0.15 mL, 0.3 mL], and Anapen(®) 300 [0.3 mL]) with varying needle length, needle gauge, and force applied to the plunger. In the first study, the autoinjector provided higher peak volumes of injectate, indicating a greater degree of dispersion, compared with manual syringe delivery. In the second study, EpiPen autoinjectors resulted in larger dispersion volumes and higher initial dispersion ratios, which decreased rapidly over time, suggesting a greater rate of uptake of injectate than the other autoinjectors. The differences in dispersion and uptake of injectate are likely the result of different functional characteristics of the delivery systems. Both studies demonstrate that the functional characteristics of the method for delivering IM injections impact the dispersion and uptake of the material injected, which could significantly affect the pharmacokinetics and, ultimately, the effectiveness of the drug.","Hill, Robert L; Wilmot, John G; Belluscio, Beth A; Cleary, Kevin; Lindisch, David; Tucker, Robin; Wilson, Emmanuel; Shukla, Rajesh B",Medical devices,https://doi.org/10.2147/mder.s83406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27536164/,383

This single-center study aims to show that symptomatic IS treatment by using the Neuroform Atlas stent (Stryker neurovascular, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) could be effective in reducing vessel stenosis. Methods Ten patients affected by AIS or TIA, in the vascular territory of high-grade intracranial atherosclerotic lesions (>70% of vessel stenosis), older than 18-year-old, were treated by implanting a Neuroform Atlas stent (diameter of 4.5mm in 80% and 4mm in 20%). 70% of the patients underwent pre-stenting intracranial angioplasty. Results Patients were between 54.8 and 83 years old (mean 68.46y ± 8.44y), 70% males and 30% females. At admission, 50% of all patients had an AIS and 50% a TIA. Restoration of the stenotic lumen was obtained after the endovascular procedure. The percentage mean of vascular stenosis was 83.7% ± 6.09% before treatment (t0), 52.2% ± 10.42% at the end of treatment (t1) and 46.2% ± 8.28% at the follow-up (t2). The IS percentage mean reduction between t0 and t1 was 31.5% ± 7.31%, and between t1 and t2 was 6% ± 5.47%, t0 and t2 of 37.5% ± 7.38%. Percentage reduction of IS was highly significant between time t0 and t1 (p = 0.005), and t0 and t2 (p = 0.005), also with a significant reduction between t1 and t2 (p = 0.012). No patient had experienced an increase of the ischemic area in the vascular territory of the target vessel at 3 months from the initial assessment. 10% of patients experienced a 3-months negative outcome (mRS = 5), 90% experienced a favorable outcome (mRS ≤2). Conclusions Intracranial stenosis endovascular treatment with Neuroform Atlas stent provides encouraging results, with a statistically significant association between the vascular caliber improvement and the endovascular treatment.","Buonomo, Orazio; Mormina, Enricomaria; Caragliano, Antonio Armando; Tessitore, Agostino; Pitrone, Antonio; Velo, Mariano; Cavallaro, Marco; Visalli, Carmela; Granata, Francesca; Vadalà, Carmela; Vinci, Sergio Lucio",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34604563/,383
117020,From Bench to Bedside: Patience is a Virtue-A Time to Reflect and Reevaluate Surgical Indications.,2020-05-20,"BACKGROUND/AIMS We are evaluated technique of anatomic major and minor hepatic resections using suprahilar-extrafascial dissection of Glissonean pedicle with vascular stapling device for transection of hepatic vessels intending to minimize operative time, and blood loss. METHODOLOGY We prospectively analyzed the clinical records of 170 patients who underwent hepatic resection by suprahilar-extrafascial pedicle isolation and stapling technique in our clinic for emergency surgery in Belgrade. Patients who underwent hilar extrahepatic intrafascial dissection were excluded from the study. RESULTS We performed 102 minor liver resections and 68 major hepatectomies. The minor liver resections were associated with significantly shorter surgery duration (95.1±31.1 vs. 186.6±56.5) and transection time (35.9±14.5 vs. 65.3±17.2) than major hepatectomies (P<0.001 for all). The mean blood loss was 255.6±129.9 mL in minor resection and 385.7±200.1 mL in major resection (P=0.003). The mean blood transfusion requirement was 300.8±99.5 mL for the patients with minor hepatectomy and 450.9±89.6 mL for those with major liver resection (P=0.067). There was no significant difference in morbidity and mortality between the groups (P=0.989; P=0.920). Major as well as minor liver resection were a superior oncologic operation with no significant difference in the 3-year overall survival rates. CONCLUSIONS Extrafascial dissection of Glissonean pedicle with vascular stapling represents both an effective and safe surgical technique of anatomical liver resection. Presented approach allows early and easy ischemic delineation of appropriate anatomical liver territory to be removed (hemiliver, section, segment) with selective inflow vascular control. Also, it is not time consuming and it is very useful in re-resection, as well as oncologically reasonable.","Karamarković, Aleksandar; Doklestić, Krstina",Hepatobiliary surgery and nutrition,https://doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2304-3881.2014.09.09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25392834/,383

Ischaemia-modified albumin (IMA), a product deriving from albumin as a result of the modification by oxidative free radicals in response to hypoxia, was previously used as a marker of ischaemia in acute coronary syndrome. We performed this study to determine whether umbilical venous IMA levels are associated with IUGR. A total of 40 pregnancies with IUGR were compared with 40 of normal fetal development. Blood samples were obtained from the umbilical vein after delivery. IMA levels in the IUGR group were higher than in the control group (78.74 ± 6.87 vs 74.43 ± 7.84 U/ml, respectively, p = 0.011). An elevated IMA level was associated with IUGR (OR: 1.079, 95% CI: 1.000-1.163, p = 0.049). We suggest that IMA, which was formerly proved to arise in ischaemic conditions, may also be a valuable marker in perinatal hypoxia and IUGR detection.","Karadeniz, O; Mendilcioglu, I; Ozdem, S; Ozekinci, M; Sanhal, C Y; Uzun, G; Sakinci, M; Simsek, M",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.3109/01443615.2014.930101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24999531/,383

METHODS Twenty-four healthy participants, 30-60 years of age, were assessed for muscle power asymmetry during isokinetic knee extension and ground reaction force asymmetry during chair-rise and vertical jump tasks. Neuromuscular activation asymmetry and coactivation of vastus lateralis (VL) and biceps femoris (BF) were assessed in each condition. Symmetric (SG) and asymmetric (AG) groups were identified using a 10% knee extension power asymmetry criterion. RESULTS The AG had greater chair-rise rate of force development asymmetry (P = 0.003, d = 1.29), but a similar chair-rise and vertical jump peak force asymmetry as the SG. Large group effects were found for VL activation asymmetry during knee extension (P = 0.047, d = 0.87), BF activation asymmetry during vertical jump (P = 0.015, d = 1.12), and strong leg coactivation during vertical jump (P = 0.028, d = 0.96).

It may have an adverse effect on interpersonal and family relations and can lead to a general negative attitude towards life. AIM The purpose of this study is to investigate whether burnout is associated with the mental health status of health care providers. MATERIAL AND METHODS The sample in this study consisted of 240 health care employees. The Greek version of Maslach's Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used for measuring burnout levels and the Greek version of the Symptoms Rating Scale for Depression and Anxiety (SRSDA) questionnaire was used to evaluate health care providers' mental health status. Descriptive statistics were initially generated for sample characteristics. Normality was checked by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and data was processed with parametric tests. General linear models with MBI dimensions as independent variables and SRSDA subscales as dependent variables were used to determine the relation between burnout and mental health status. Statistics were processed with SPSS v. 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical significance was set at p=0.05. RESULTS The average age of the sample is 40.00±7.95 years. Regarding gender the percentage of men is 21.40% (N=49) and of women is 78.60% (N=180). Overall the professional burnout of health care workers is moderate. The mean score for emotional exhaustion is 26.41, for personal accomplishment 36.70 and for depersonalization 9.81. The mean for each subscale of SRSDA is 8.23±6.79 for Depression Beck-21, 3.96±4.26 for Depression Beck-13, 4.91±4.44 for Melancholia, 6.32±4.35 for Asthenia and 6.36±4.72 for Anxiety. The results of general linear models with the MBI dimensions as independent variables and the SRSDA subscales as dependent variables are shown that emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment are statistically correlated with all subscales of SRSDA, while depersonalization is not correlated with any SRSDA subscale. CONCLUSIONS Burnout appears to implicate mental health status of healthcare providers in work index. Emotional exhaustion is the burnout dimension that is correlated the most with employees' mental health.","Papathanasiou, Ioanna V",Acta informatica medica : AIM : journal of the Society for Medical Informatics of Bosnia & Herzegovina : casopis Drustva za medicinsku informatiku BiH,https://doi.org/10.5455/aim.2015.23.22-28; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25870487/,383
118969,Virtual Cancer Care During and Beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic: We Need to Get It Right.,2020-05-13,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are ubiquitous in the vertebrate genomes. On occasion, hosts recruited retroviral genes to mediate their own biological functions, a process formally known as co-option or exaptation. Much remains unknown about the extent of retroviral gene co-option in vertebrates, although more than ten retroviral gene co-option events have been documented. Here, we use a phylogenomic approach to analyze more than 700 vertebrate genomes to uncover retroviral gene co-option taking place during the evolution of vertebrates. We identify a total of 177 independent retroviral gene co-option events in vertebrates, a majority of which have not been reported previously. Among these retroviral gene co-option events, 93 and 84 involve gag and env genes, respectively. More than 78.0% (138 out of 177) of retroviral gene co-option occurred within mammals. The gag and env co-option events share a generally similar temporal pattern with less frequent retroviral gene co-option identified in the deep branches, suggesting that retroviral gene co-option might have not been maintained for very long time periods. Moreover, we find co-opted retroviral genes are subject to different selection pressure, implying potentially diverse cellular functionality. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of co-opted retroviral genes during the evolution of vertebrates, and has implications in understanding the ancient evolution of vertebrate-retrovirus interaction.","Wang, Jianhua; Han, Guan-Zhu",Molecular biology and evolution,https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667990/,383

METHODS Medical records and imaging studies of cats with TVCS were retrospectively reviewed. Outcome was acquired from patient records and from owners or referring veterinary surgeons via a telephone questionnaire. For each case, breed-, age- and sex-matched controls were identified with CT imaging of the thoracic vertebral column. For each cat, vertebral canal height was determined at three levels for each thoracic vertebra. Vertebral canal heights were compared between control cats of different breeds and between affected and control cats of the same breed. RESULTS Nine TVCS cases were included. British Shorthairs and male neutered cats were over-represented (P <0.05). Median age at presentation was 9 years. All cats were presented for a chronic, progressive, painful, ambulatory, T3-L3 myelopathy. Five cats were treated conservatively, three surgically and one was euthanased. Two cats treated surgically demonstrated improvement of clinical signs and one demonstrated initial improvement followed by deterioration. Of the conservatively treated cats, three deteriorated and two improved. Compared with controls, affected cats had a lower vertebral canal height at multiple thoracic vertebral levels, being most prominent for British Shorthairs and domestic shorthairs (P <0.05). Unaffected British Shorthairs had a lower thoracic vertebral canal height at multiple levels than control domestic shorthairs (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE TVCS should be considered a differential diagnosis in middle-aged to older cats presenting with a chronic, progressive, painful, T3-L3 myelopathy. The predisposition of British Shorthairs could be explained by a narrower vertebral canal in this breed.","Gillespie, Sabrina; De Decker, Steven",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x20920041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32436803/,383

Currently, there is no agreed minimum standard for training in ultrasound applied to rheumatology patient management. We present our experiences of implementing a competency driven ultrasound training, focused on hands and feet.

The RSC is delivered via a blended learning approach and includes training workshops, mentorship and clinical competency assessments. Mentors are supported and developed within their role. 31 trainees have enrolled on the course between 2014 and 2019. To date, 22 (71%) have completed. Change of job role was the main factor leading to non-completion. Thirteen mentors have supported the training and assessment of RSC trainees. All trainees reported positively that ultrasound training via the RSC model fulfilled their learning needs. CONCLUSION The RSC is a feasible ultrasound training model for rheumatology practitioners. Whilst it provides a robust training framework, mentorship fees and university overheads increase the cost. The RSC provides motivation to mentors to train external trainees and supports the development of new ultrasound-based rheumatology services.","Ciechomska, Anna; McKay, Neil D; Newcombe, Lisa; Brandon, Mhairi; Youssef, Hazem; Platt, Philip; Dale, James; Dickson, Diane M",Scottish medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/0036933020983569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882740/,383

We examine the association between rural hospitals' participation in an ACO and their performance on utilization and financial measures. METHODS This quasi-experimental study estimates the relationship between voluntary ACO participation and hospital metrics using propensity score-matched, longitudinal regression models with year and hospital fixed effects. Regression models controlled for secular trends and time-varying hospital and county characteristics. Hospital measures were from the American Hospital Association, RAND Hospital Data, and Leavitt Partners. The initial population comprises 643 rural hospitals that participated in an ACO for at least one year during the 2011 to 2018 study period and 1,541 rural hospitals that did not participate in an ACO. From this population we created a sample of propensity score-matched hospitals consisting of 525 ACO-participating and 525 comparable non-ACO hospitals. RESULTS Rural hospitals' participation in an ACO is not associated with changes in hospital utilization or financial measures, nor is there an association between these performance metrics and whether another within-county hospital participated in an ACO. A secondary analysis limited to Critical Access Hospitals provides some evidence that inpatient utilization increases in the second year of ACO participation, though the increases are not significant in year 3 and beyond. CONCLUSION We find no evidence that rural hospitals experience substantive changes in outpatient visits, inpatient utilization, or operating margin in the years immediately after joining an ACO.","Comfort, Leeann N; Fulton, Brent D; Shortell, Stephen M",The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/jrh.12494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32657481/,383

DESIGN A qualitative design was applied. METHODS Twenty-six people in Sydney, Australia, took part in semi-structured interviews, which were audio-recorded and coded using Framework analysis. RESULTS Half the participants (54%) had limited health literacy, whereas 38% adequate health literacy (using Newest Vital Sign). Regardless of health literacy, people described how monitoring increased self-management awareness and signalled periods of low self-management ('lulls'). Accounts of monitoring to sustain motivation were more apparent for participants with adequate health literacy. Most participants described simple and flexible rules (e.g. use artificial sweeteners; eat in moderation). Two schemas related to 'lulls': a 'problem-solving orientation' depicted lulls as inevitable and was associated with varied coping strategies; a 'willpower orientation' attributed lulls to lack of 'willpower,' and described willpower as a main coping strategy. CONCLUSION There is considerable variation in how people think about their diabetes self-management and the strategies they use. Health literacy may contribute to some of this variation. Self-management interventions could benefit from depicting motivation as fluctuating and challenging ideas about willpower and self-blame.","Ayre, Julie; Bonner, Carissa; Muscat, Danielle M; Bramwell, Sian; McClelland, Sharon; Jayaballa, Rajini; Maberly, Glen; McCaffery, Kirsten",Psychology & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2021.1909023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931003/,383

121758,Self-Care and Gratitude.,2021,"Lower respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of paediatric morbidity and mortality worldwide. Children in low-income countries are disproportionately affected. This is in large part due to limitations in healthcare resources and medical technologies. Mechanical ventilation can be a life-saving therapy for many children with acute respiratory failure. The scarcity of functioning ventilators in low-income countries results in countless preventable deaths. Some hospitals have attempted to adapt to this scarcity by using hand-bag ventilation, as either a bridge to a mechanical ventilator, or until clinical improvement occurs rendering mechanical ventilation no longer necessary. In instances of hand-bag ventilation, an endotracheal tube is first placed. Family members are then asked to play the role of a ventilator, manually compressing a bag repeatedly to inflate the child's lungs. This approach is fraught with numerous ethical challenges. A careful examination of the data and a nuanced approach to the ethical considerations are imperative. Ethical arguments in support of and in opposition to allowing parental hand-bag ventilation are explored, including the best interests of the child, the child's right to an open future, beneficence and parental protection, legitimising substandard care, and finally, contextual concerns. An algorithmic, potentially ethically permissible approach to parental participation in manual ventilation is proposed.","Barsky, Emily; Sayeed, Sadath",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2019-105992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376715/,383

To tackle this problem, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms of such unequal hiring opportunities. Therefore, we conducted a vignette experiment with 425 genuine recruiters and jointly tested the potential stigma against job candidates with a history of burnout that were mentioned earlier in the literature. We found candidates revealing a history of burnout elicit perceptions of requiring work adaptations, likely having more unpleasant collaborations with others as well as diminished health, autonomy, ability to work under pressure, leadership capacity, manageability, and learning ability, when compared to candidates with a comparable gap in working history due to physical injury. Led by perceptions of a reduced ability to work under pressure, the tested perceptions jointly explained over 90 % of the effect of revealing burnout on the probability of being invited to a job interview. In addition, the negative effect on interview probability of revealing burnout was stronger when the job vacancy required higher stress tolerance. In contrast, the negative impact of revealing burnout on interview probability appeared weaker when recruiters were women and when recruiters had previously had personal encounters with burnout.","Sterkens, Philippe; Baert, Stijn; Rooman, Claudia; Derous, Eva",Economics and human biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2021.101050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34375926/,383

Thus, the objective of this study is to determine the factors influencing the use of reproductive health services among young women in Nepal. METHODS Data have been extracted from the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) datasets wherein the weighted sample population size was restricted for modern contraceptive use to 1593 whereas for the antenatal care and skilled birth attendants to1606. This study has selected three reproductive health indicators as outcome variables of reproductive health service utilization for the analysis viz, modern contraceptive use, at least four antenatal care visits, and use of skilled birth attendants. Likewise, all calculations are based on standard sample weight of NDHS. RESULTS The study has found that 21% of young women used modern contraception, 71% attended at least four ANC visits, and 67% utilized a skilled birth attendant at delivery. Young Janajati women, women having 1-2, and 3 or more living children, women participating household decision-making, and the ones having exposure to media were more likely to use modern contraceptives, whereas the women who want more children were less likely to use them. Higher education attainments, higher wealth quintile, and lower birth order were associated with higher level of receiving at least four ANC visits and SBAs. However, the young women willing to have more children and having access to media have higher odds of receiving at least four ANC visits; and the women attending four and more ANC visits have higher odds of using SBAs. CONCLUSIONS In order to improve the use of reproductive health services among young women, efforts should be made to enrich the young women of lower educational level, lower economic status, higher birth order, and lower exposure to media. Further research is required to detect the causes that affect the use of reproductive health services.","Thapa, Naba Raj",Reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-020-00954-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32600458/,383

The validation set (n=74) was further built to confirm the prognostic significance of this classifier. We then divided patients into high- and low-risk groups according to the IHC score. In the training set, the 5-year OS rate was 22.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.2%- 43.2%) for the high-risk group and 54.1% (95% CI: 41.8%-69.9%) for the low-risk group (P<0.001), and in the validation set, the 5-year OS rate was 38.1% (95% CI: 17.9%-81.1%) for the high-risk group and 43.1% (95% CI: 30.0%-61.9%) for the low-risk group (P=0.26). Multivariable analysis revealed that IHC score, T stage, and primary tumor site were independent variables for predicting OS (all P<0.05). We developed a nomogram incorporating clinicopathological risk factors (primary site and T stage) and the IHC score to predict 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS. Conclusions A nomogram was generated and confirmed to be of clinical value. Our IHC classifier integrating five IHC markers could help clinicians make decisions and determine optimal treatments for patients with MMHN.","Xu, Qing-Qing; Li, Qing-Jie; Huang, Cheng-Long; Cai, Mu-Yan; Zhang, Mei-Fang; Yin, Shao-Han; Lu, Li-Xia; Chen, Lei",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.708293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394109/,383
122815,What is the Trend in Representation of Women and Under-represented Minorities in Orthopaedic Surgery Residency?,2021-06-28,"INTRODUCTION Activation of the complement system may occur during blood-membrane interactions in hemodialysis and contribute to chronic inflammation of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hydrophilic modification with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) has been suggested to increase the biocompatibility profile of dialysis membranes. In the present study we compared complement activation of synthetic and cellulose-based membranes, including the polysulfone membrane with α-tocopherol-stabilized, PVP-enriched inner surface of the novel FX CorAL dialyzer, and linked the results to their physical characteristics. METHODS Eight synthetic and cellulose-based dialyzers (FX CorAL, FX CorDiax [Fresenius Medical Care]; Polyflux, THERANOVA [Baxter]; ELISIO, SUREFLUX [Nipro]; xevonta [B. Braun]; FDX [Nikkisio Medical]) were investigated in the present study. Complement activation (C3a, C5a, sC5b-9) was evaluated in a 3h ex vivo recirculation model with human blood. Albumin sieving coefficients were determined over a 4h ex vivo recirculation model with human plasma as a surrogate of secondary membrane formation. Zeta potential was measured as an indicator for the surface charge of the membranes. RESULTS The FX CorAL dialyzer induced the lowest activation of the three complement factors (C3a: -39.4%; C5a: -57.5%; sC5b-9: -58.9% compared to the reference). Highest complement activation was found for the cellulose-based SUREFLUX (C3a: +154.0%) and the FDX (C5a: +335.0%; sC5b-9: +287.9%) dialyzers. Moreover, the FX CorAL dialyzer had the nearest-to-neutral zeta potential (-2.38 mV) and the lowest albumin sieving coefficient decrease over time. Albumin sieving coefficient decrease was associated with complement activation by the investigated dialyzers. CONCLUSION Our present results indicate that the surface modification implemented in the FX CorAL dialyzer reduces secondary membrane formation and improves the biocompatibility profile. Further clinical studies are needed to investigate whether these observations will result in a lower inflammatory burden of hemodialysis patients.","Melchior, Pascal; Erlenkötter, Ansgar; Zawada, Adam M; Delinski, Dirk; Schall, Christian; Stauss-Grabo, Manuela; Kennedy, James P",Artificial organs,https://doi.org/10.1111/aor.13887; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33326619/,383
123180,Mitigating and learning from the impact of COVID-19 infection on addictive disorders.,2020-04-06,"As new pathogenic viruses continue to emerge, it is paramount to have intervention strategies that target a common denominator in these pathogens. The fusion of viral and cellular membranes during viral entry is one such process that is used by many pathogenic viruses, including chikungunya virus, West Nile virus, and influenza virus. Obatoclax, a small-molecule antagonist of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, was previously determined to have activity against influenza A virus and also Sindbis virus. Here, we report it to be active against alphaviruses, like chikungunya virus (50% effective concentration [EC50] = 0.03 μM) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV; EC50 = 0.11 μM). Obatoclax inhibited viral entry processes in an SFV temperature-sensitive mutant entry assay. A neutral red retention assay revealed that obatoclax induces the rapid neutralization of the acidic environment of endolysosomal vesicles and thereby most likely inhibits viral fusion. Characterization of escape mutants revealed that the L369I mutation in the SFV E1 fusion protein was sufficient to confer partial resistance against obatoclax. Other inhibitors that target the Bcl-2 family of antiapoptotic proteins inhibited neither viral entry nor endolysosomal acidification, suggesting that the antiviral mechanism of obatoclax does not depend on its anticancer targets. Obatoclax inhibited the growth of flaviviruses, like Zika virus, West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus, which require low pH for fusion, but not that of pH-independent picornaviruses, like coxsackievirus A9, echovirus 6, and echovirus 7. In conclusion, obatoclax is a novel inhibitor of endosomal acidification that prevents viral fusion and that could be pursued as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral candidate.","Varghese, Finny S; Rausalu, Kai; Hakanen, Marika; Saul, Sirle; Kümmerer, Beate M; Susi, Petri; Merits, Andres; Ahola, Tero",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.02227-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27993855/,383

Effects on psychosocial variables.,2020-07-31,"Predicting water contamination by statistical models is a useful tool to manage health risk in recreational beaches. Extreme contamination events, i.e. those exceeding normative are generally rare with respect to bathing conditions and thus the data is said to be imbalanced. Modeling and predicting those rare events present unique challenges. Here we introduce and evaluate several machine learning techniques and metrics to model imbalanced data and evaluate model performance. We do so by using a) simulated data-sets and b) a real data base with records of faecal coliform abundance monitored for 10 years in 21 recreational beaches in Uruguay (N ≈ 19000) using in situ and meteorological variables. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the methods and provide a simple guide to perform models for a general audience. We also provide R codes to reproduce model fitting and testing. We found that most Machine Learning techniques are sensitive to imbalance and require specific data pre-treatment (e.g. upsampling) to improve performance. Accuracy (i.e. correctly classified cases over total cases) is not adequate to evaluate model performance on imbalanced data set. Instead, true positive rates (TPR) and false positive rates (FPR) are recommended. Among the 52 possible candidate algorithms tested, the stratified Random forest presented the better performance improving TPR in 50% with respect to baseline (0.4) and outperformed baseline in the evaluated metrics. Support vector machines combined with upsampling method or synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) performed well, similar to Adaboost with SMOTE. These results suggests that combining modeling strategies is necessary to improve our capacity to anticipate water contamination and avoid health risk.","Bourel, Mathias; Segura, Angel M; Crisci, Carolina; López, Guzmán; Sampognaro, Lia; Vidal, Victoria; Kruk, Carla; Piccini, Claudia; Perera, Gonzalo",Water research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.117450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352535/,383

Synthetic treatment that can promote wound healing in a regenerative manner would provide an off-the-shelf, non-immunogenic strategy to improve clinical care of severe burn wounds. Here, we demonstrate the vulnerary efficacy and accelerated healing mechanism of a dextran-based hydrogel in a third-degree porcine burn model. The model was optimized to allow examination of the hydrogel treatment for clinical translation and its regenerative response mechanisms. Hydrogel treatment accelerated third-degree burn wound healing by rapid wound closure, improved re-epithelialization, enhanced extracellular matrix remodeling, and greater nerve reinnervation, compared with the dressing-treated group. These effects appear to be mediated through the ability of the hydrogel to facilitate a rapid but brief initial inflammatory response that coherently stimulates neovascularization within the granulation tissue during the first week of treatment, followed by an efficient vascular regression to promote a regenerative healing process. Our results suggest that the dextran-based hydrogels may substantially improve healing quality and reduce skin grafting incidents and thus pave the way for clinical studies to improve the care of severe burn injury patients.","Shen, Yu-I; Song, Hyun-Ho Greco; Papa, Arianne; Burke, Jacqueline; Volk, Susan W; Gerecht, Sharon",The Journal of investigative dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1038/jid.2015.182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26358387/,383

In part, this reflects the need for efficient methods to monitor over time the progress of PRRSV status of participating herds. This study assessed the feasibility of monitoring PRRSV using oral fluids collected at the abattoir. A total of 36 pig lots were included in the study. On-farm oral fluid (n = 10) and serum (n = 10) collected within two days of shipment to the abattoir were used to establish the reference PRRSV status of the population. Oral fluids (n = 3 per lot) were successfully collected from 32 lots (89%) at the lairage. Three veterinary diagnostic laboratories (VDLs) tested the sera (VDL1 and VDL3: n = 316, VDL2: n = 315) and oral fluids (VDL1 and VDL3: n = 319, VDL2: n = 320) for PRRSV antibodies (ELISA) and RNA (rRT-PCR). Environmental samples (n = 64, 32 before and 32 after pigs were placed in lairage) were tested for PRRSV RNA at one VDL. All oral fluids (farm and abattoir) tested positive for PRRSV antibody at all VDLs. PRRSV positivity frequency on serum ranged from 92.4% to 94.6% among VDLs, with an overall agreement of 97.6%. RNA was detected on 1.3% to 1.9%, 8.1% to 17.7%, and 8.3% to 17.7% of sera, on-farm and abattoir oral fluids, respectively. Between-VDLs rRT-PCR agreement on sera and oral fluids (farm and abattoir) ranged from 97.8% to 99.0%, and 79.0% to 81.2%, respectively.

127002,Biologic therapy for psoriasis during the covid-19 outbreak is not a choice.,2020-04-06,"Adenoviruses (AdV) are etiologic agents for gastrointestinal, heart, eye, and respiratory tract infections that can be lethal for immunosuppressed people. Many AdV use the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) as a primary receptor. The CAR isoform resulting from alternative splicing that includes the eighth exon, CAREx8, localizes to the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells and is responsible for the initiation of AdV infection. We have shown that the membrane level of CAREx8 is tightly regulated by two MAGI-1 PDZ domains; PDZ2, and PDZ4, resulting in increased or decreased AdV transduction, respectively. We hypothesized that targeting the interactions between the MAGI-1 PDZ2 domain and CAREx8 would decrease apical CAREx8 expression level and prevent AdV infection. Decoy peptides that target MAGI-1 PDZ2, were synthesized (TAT-E6, TAT-NET1). PDZ2 binding peptides decreased CAREx8 expression and reduced AdV transduction. CAREx8 degradation was triggered by activation of the regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) pathway through the disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM17) and γ-secretase. Further analysis revealed that ADAM17 interacts directly with the MAGI-1 PDZ3 domain and blocking the PDZ2 domain enhanced the accessibility of ADAM17 to the substrate (CAREx8). Finally, we validated the efficacy of TAT-PDZ2 peptides in protecting the epithelia from AdV transduction in vivo using a novel transgenic animal model. Our data suggest that TAT-PDZ2 binding peptides are novel anti-AdV molecules that act by enhanced RIP of CAREx8 and decreased AdV entry. This strategy has an additional translational potential for targeting other viral receptors which have PDZ binding domains such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor.IMPORTANCEAdenovirus is a common threat in immunosuppressed populations and military recruits. There are no currently approved treatments/prophylactic agents that protect from most AdV infections. Here, we developed peptide-based small molecules that can suppress AdV infection of polarized epithelia by targeting the AdV receptor, coxsackievirus, and adenovirus receptor (CAREx8). The newly discovered peptides target a specific PDZ domain of the CAREx8 interacting protein MAGI-1 and decreased AdV transduction in multiple polarized epithelia models. Peptides-induce CAREx8 degradation is triggered by extracellular domain shedding through ADAM17 followed by γ-secretase-mediated nuclear translocation of the C-terminal domain. The enhanced shedding of CAREx8 ECD further protected the epithelium from AdV infection. Taken together, these novel molecules protect the epithelium from AdV infection. This approach may be applicable to the development of novel antiviral molecules against other viruses that use a receptor with a PDZ binding domain.","Alghamri, Mahmoud S; Sharma, Priyanka; Williamson, Timothy L; Readler, James M; Yan, Ran; Rider, S Dean; Hostetler, Heather A; Cool, David R; Kolawole, Abimbola O; Excoffon, Katherine J D A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00046-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762416/,383
127010,The impact of thermal pasteurization on viral load and detectable live viruses in human milk and other matrices: A rapid review.,2020-07-10,"Background: Implant-associated infections are still a major complication in the field of orthopedics. Bacteria can form biofilms on implant surfaces, making them more difficult to detect and treat. Since standard antibiotic therapy is often impaired in biofilm infections, particular interest is directed towards finding treatment alternatives. Biofilm-formation is a well-organized process during which bacteria communicate via quorum-sensing molecules (QSM). The aim of this study was to inhibit bacterial communication by directing avian IgY against specific QSM. Methods: Chicken were immunized against the following QSM: (1) AtlE, a member of the autolysin family which mediates attachment to a surface in Staphylococcus epidermidis; (2) GroEL, the bacterial heat shock protein; (3) PIA (polysaccharide intercellular adhesion), which is essential for cell-cell adhesion in biofilms. Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms were grown and inhibition of biofilm-formation by IgYs was evaluated. Additionally, human osteoblasts were cultivated and biocompatibility of IgYs was tested. Results: We were able to demonstrate that all IgYs reduced biofilm-formation, also without prior immunization. Therefore, the response was probably not specific with regard to the QSM. Osteoblasts were activated by all IgYs which was demonstrated by microscopy and an increased release of IL-8. Conclusions: In conclusion, avian IgY inhibits biofilm-formation, though the underlying mechanism is not yet clear. However, adverse effects on local tissue cells (osteoblasts) were also observed.","Dapunt, Ulrike; Prior, Birgit; Oelkrug, Christopher; Kretzer, Jan Philippe",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25174027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899313/,383

127614,"Comments on ,,Does COVID -19 influence sexual behaviours?""",2020-07-28,"BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is responsible for 1% of deaths worldwide, and the incidence continues to increase. Despite surveillance programs, 70% of HCC patients are not suitable for curative options at diagnosis, and therefore, non-curative treatments are essential to modern clinical practice. There are many novel treatments, though their roles are not well defined. This study aimed to contrast Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) and Drug Eluting Bead Transarterial Chemoembolisation (DEB-TACE) to further define their roles. METHODS This was a retrospective multicentre cohort study. Factors included for analysis were type of HCC treatment, number of lesions, lesion size, multiple disease severity scores, cirrhosis and vascular invasion. The primary endpoint was transplant-free survival. RESULTS Transplant-free survival was similar between the two cohorts (p = 0.654), despite a variation in median lesion size, SIRT: 54.5 mm, DEB-TACE: 34 mm (p ≤ 0.001). A univariate Cox proportional hazard model utilising treatment modality as the covariate showed no significant difference in survival (DEB-TACE HR 1.4 (95%CI 0.85-2.15 p = 0.207). The size of the largest lesion was the best predictor of 3-year survival (p = 0.035). Lesion size was inversely associated with survival (HR 1.01 (95%CI 1-1.02, p = 0.025)) on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION This study is the first to catalogue the experience of using SIRT in HCC in a real-world Australian population. It has demonstrated no difference in survival outcomes between DEB-TACE and SIRT. Further, it has shown SIRT to be a reasonable alternative to DEB-TACE especially in larger lesions and has demonstrated that DEB-TACE has a role in select patients with advanced disease.","Hirsch, Ryan D; Mills, Chris; Sawhney, Rohit; Sood, Siddharth; Bird, Virginia; Mishra, Gauri; Dev, Anouk; Kemp, William; Lubel, John; Roberts, Stuart K; Gow, Paul; Nicoll, Amanda J",Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12029-020-00502-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901445/,383

METHODS Retrospective observational cohort study on 269 consecutive patients who underwent elective incisional hernia mesh repair, laparoscopic group (N = 94) and open group (N = 175), between May 2004 and July 2014. RESULTS Operative time was shorter in the laparoscopic versus open group (p < 0.0001). Perioperative morbidity and mortality were similar in the two groups. Patients in the laparoscopic group were discharged a median of 2 days earlier (p < 0.0001). At a median follow-up over 50 months, no difference in hernia recurrence was detected between the groups. In laparoscopic group total institutional costs were lower (p = 0.02). At Cox regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders, large wall defect (W3) and higher operative risk (ASA score 3-4) were associated with prolonged operative time, while midline hernia site was associated with increased hospital LOS. Open surgical approach was associated with prolongation of both operative time and LOS. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic approach may be considered safely to all patients for incisional hernia repair, regardless of patients' characteristics (age, gender, BMI, ASA score, comorbidities) and size of the wall defect (W2-3), with the advantage of shorter operating time and hospital LOS that yields reduced total institutional costs. Patients with higher ASA score and large hernia defects are at risk of prolonged operative time, while an open approach is associated with longer duration of surgical operation and hospital LOS.","Soliani, G; De Troia, A; Portinari, M; Targa, S; Carcoforo, P; Vasquez, G; Fisichella, P M; Feo, C V",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-017-1601-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28396956/,383

AIMS Intra- and inter-observer consistency in assessing PPM was examined using both hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and TFF2-IHC. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventy-four oxyntic biopsy samples obtained from autoimmune gastritis were considered. Two serial histological sections obtained from the paraffin-embedded tissue-samples were stained with H&E and TFF2-IHC. Three pathologists (Alpha, Beta, Gamma) independently scored PPM by both staining and the Intra- and inter-observer consistency (H&E versus TFF2-IHC) was calculated using k-statistics and/or Spearman's coefficient. RESULTS Based on H&E-stain versus TFF2-IHC, intra-observer consistency in PPM assessement was ranked as consistently ""good"" (k-values: Alpha=0.79; Beta=0.78; Gamma=0.75). Based on H&E, the overall PPM inter-observer consistency among the 3 observers was ranked as ""good"" (k=0.77) (the inter-observer consistency for pairs of observers was as follows: Alpha versus Beta k=0.88; Alpha versus Gamma k=0.87; Beta versus Gamma k=0.80).

The Cover accessory (Lazarus Effect; Campbell, California, USA) is a novel nitinol braided mesh device that surrounds the stent retrieval device and thrombus during the retrieval process to help prevent clot fragmentation and embolization. METHODS Using the in vitro model, after introducing fresh clot into the middle cerebral artery, we compared rates of target vessel recanalization and embolization in new territories (areas in which clot had not been introduced) achieved with the Solitaire Flow Restoration (FR) stent retriever (Covidien, Irvine, California) in conjunction with the use of a conventional guide catheter (control group), a balloon guide catheter (BGC group), and the Cover device (Cover group). RESULTS In a total of 51 thrombectomy experiments (20 in the control group, 20 in the BGC group, and 11 in the Cover group), successful recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b-3) was achieved more frequently in the Cover group than in the control group or in the BGC group (p=0.047 and p=0.020, respectively). Embolization of new (previously unaffected) territories occurred in five (25%) experiments from the control group and in three (15%) experiments from the BGC group, whereas no embolization of new territories was seen with Cover device assisted thrombectomy. CONCLUSIONS Application of the Cover device in this experimental model resulted in higher successful recanalization rates, no embolic events, and was more effective than use of the conventional guide catheter or BGC.","Mokin, Maxim; Setlur Nagesh, Swetadri Vasan; Ionita, Ciprian N; Mocco, J; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25676149/,383
130431,Cauda equina syndrome after a TLIF resulting from postoperative expansion of a hydrogel dural sealant.,2012,"Septic shock is a clinical condition with high mortality (40%-70%) and morbidity. During septic shock, there is a significant release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators that can cause damage to different organs, known as a ""cytokine storm."" The cytokine storm can cause hypotension, tissue damage, metabolic acidosis, and renal failure. This clinical picture also seems to be confirmed in the context of Covid-19 patients. Hemoadsorption with CytoSorb represents an adjunctive therapy to attenuate the systemic inflammatory process and helps restore a balanced immune response. We present the clinical case of a 75-year-old man, admitted to our hospital with respiratory failure due to Sars-CoV-2 infection and secondary septic shock due to a sacral decubitus. On admission the patient presented with a clinical picture of mixed acidosis with high levels of lactate and inflammatory indexes. Simultaneously along with antibiotic therapy, we started hemoadsorption treatment with CytoSorb in combination with continuous venous-venous hemodiafiltration. At the end of the treatment the patient had recovered his vital functions and the infection was successfully treated. Use of the CytoSorb device in a Covid-19 positive patient was safe and well-tolerated. Early treatment with CytoSorb decreased interleukin 6 plasma levels and inflammatory indexes, resulting in earlier stabilization of homeostasis. This case report suggests that the use of CytoSorb could be a possible adjuvant therapy in patients with septic shock even when affected by Covid-19.","Pancani, Flavia; Pavani, Raffaella; Quacquarelli, Antonio; Feri, Marco",The International journal of artificial organs,https://doi.org/10.1177/03913988211016473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33998306/,383

This pandemic situation and magnitude of suffering has led to global effort to find out effective measures for discovery of new specific drugs and vaccines to combat this deadly disease. In addition to many initiatives to develop vaccines for protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, some of which are at various stages of clinical trials researchers worldwide are currently using available conventional therapeutic drugs with potential to combat the disease effectively in other viral infections and it is believed that these antiviral drugs could act as a promising immediate alternative. Remdesivir (RDV), a broad-spectrum anti-viral agent, initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus (EBOV) and known to show promising efficiency in in vitro and in vivo studies against SARS and MERS coronaviruses, is now being investigated against SARS-CoV-2. On May 1, 2020, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for RDV to treat COVID-19 patients [2]. A number of multicentre clinical trials are on-going to check the safety and efficacy of RDV for the treatment of COVID-19. Results of published double blind, and placebo-controlled trial on RDV against SARS-CoV-2, showed that RDV administration led to faster clinical improvement in severe COVID-19 patients compared to placebo. This review highlights the available knowledge about RDV as a therapeutic drug for coronaviruses and its preclinical and clinical trials against COVID-19.","Khazir, Jabeena; Maqbool, Tariq; Mir, Bilal Ahmad",Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389557521666210217093004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33596800/,383
132310,Early Outcomes of a National Cancer Center's Strategy Against COVID-19 Executed Through a Disease Outbreak Response Taskforce.,2021-01-13,"INTRODUCTION Our knowledge of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) pathogenesis is incomplete. The goal of this pilot study is to investigate the feasibility of measuring lower airways inflammation in patients with ARDS using repeated endotracheal aspirates (ETAs). METHODS ETAs were obtained within 24 hours by intensive care unit admission from 25 mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS and 10 of them underwent a second ETA within 96 hours after the first sampling. In each sample, cell viability was assessed using trypan blue exclusion method and the total and differential cell counts were measured using Neubauer-improved cell counting chamber and cytospins stained with Diff-Quik. RESULTS The median cell viability was 89 (IQR 80-93)%, with a median total cell count of 305 (IQR 130-1270)×103/mL and a median macrophage, neutrophil, lymphocyte and eosinophil count, respectively, of 19.8 (IQR 5.4-71.6)×103/mL; 279 (IQR 109-1213)×103/mL; 0 (IQR 0-0.188)×103/mL; 0 (IQR 0-1.050)×103/mL. Eosinophil count in the ETA correlated with the number of blood eosinophils (r=0.4840, p=0.0142). Cell viability and total and differential cell counts were neither significantly different in the second ETA compared with the first ETA nor were unaffected by the presence or absence of bacteria in the blood and/or ETA, or by the ARDS aetiology, apart from the macrophage count which was significantly increased in patients with ARDS associated with acute pancreatitis compared with those associated with pneumonia (p=0.0143). CONCLUSIONS ETA can be used to investigate the cellularity of the lower airways in patients with ARDS and it is an easy-to-perform and non-invasive procedure. Eosinophil counts in ETA and blood are significantly correlated. The number of macrophages in ETA may be affected by the aetiology of the ARDS.","Spadaro, Savino; Kozhevnikova, Iryna; Casolari, Paolo; Ruggeri, Paolo; Bellini, Tiziana; Ragazzi, Riccardo; Barbieri, Federica; Marangoni, Elisabetta; Caramori, Gaetano; Volta, Carlo Alberto",BMJ open respiratory research,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjresp-2017-000222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29071081/,383

Wearable inertial sensors enable long-term monitoring of motor activities in a patient's habitual environment and complement clinical assessments which are conducted in a standardised environment. The application of wearable sensors requires appropriate data processing algorithms to estimate clinically meaningful outcome measures, and this review will provide an overview of previously published measures, their underlying algorithms, sensor placement, and measurement properties such as validity, reproducibility, and feasibility. METHODS We will screen the literature for studies which applied inertial sensors to people with mobility impairments in free-living conditions, described the data processing algorithm reproducibly, and calculated everyday life motor activity-related outcome measures. Three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS) will be searched with terms out of four different categories: study population, measurement tool, algorithm, and outcome measure. Abstracts and full texts will be screened independently by the two review authors, and disagreement will be solved by discussion and consensus. Data will be extracted by one of the review authors and verified by the other. It includes the type of outcome measures, the underlying data processing algorithm, the required sensor technology, the corresponding sensor placement, the measurement properties, and the target population. We expect to find a high heterogeneity of outcome measures and will therefore provide a narrative synthesis of the extracted data. DISCUSSION This review will facilitate the selection of an appropriate sensor setup for future applications, contain recommendations about the design of data processing algorithms as well as their evaluation procedure, and present a gap for innovative, new algorithms, and devices.

133304,[High frequency of endoluminal thrombus in patients with ischaemic stroke following COVID-19].,2021-05-11,"Our previous research demonstrated that extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) could promote breast cancer cell invasion. However, the impact of extracellular ATP on chemoresistance and the mechanisms behind ATP pro-invasion and pro-chemoresistance remain unclear. Here we aimed to determine the molecules or signaling pathways involved. cDNA microarray was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes before and after ATP treatment. As a result, Sex-determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9) was up-regulated after ATP treatment in breast cancer cells. In vitro invasion and migration assays demonstrated that knocking down SOX9 attenuated ATP-driven invasive capability. Mass spectrometry and co-IP revealed that SOX9 interacted with Janus kinase 1 (JAK1). Afterward, IL-6-JAK1-STAT3 signaling was demonstrated to promote SOX9 expression and invasion following ATP treatment. Notably, ATP-IL-6-SOX9 signaling was shown to stimulate chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. ChIP assays identified some potential SOX9 target genes, among which carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5/6 (CEACAM5/6) was demonstrated to mediate ATP pro-invasive function, while ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) mediated ATP-driven chemoresistance. In addition, SOX9-knockdown and apyrase (an ATP hydrolase)-treated MDA-MB-231 cells illustrated decreased tumor growth and enhanced drug sensitivity in nude mice. In vitro spheroid formation assays also proved the significance of ATP-SOX9 in mediating chemoresistance. Moreover, molecules involved in ATP-SOX9 signaling were up-regulated in human breast carcinoma specimens and were associated with poor prognosis. Altogether, SOX9 signaling is vital in ATP-driven invasion and chemoresistance, which may serve as a potential target for breast cancer therapies.","Yang, Hui; Geng, Yue-Hang; Wang, Peng; Yang, Han; Zhou, Yan-Ting; Zhang, Hong-Quan; He, Hui-Ying; Fang, Wei-Gang; Tian, Xin-Xia",Oncogene,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-020-01402-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724162/,383

METHODS This single-institution retrospective study investigated 47 cases of bone tumors treated by MWA from June 2015 to June 2018. The study included 26 patients (55.3%) with benign bone tumors and 21 patients (44.7%) with malignant bone tumors. The tumors were located in the spine or sacrum (15, 31.9%), the upper extremities (6, 12.8%), the lower extremities (17, 36.2%) and the pelvis (9, 19.1%). Outcomes regarding clinical efficacy, including pain relief, quality of life, and intervention-related complications, were evaluated before and after MWA using the visual analog scale (VAS) and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) scoring system. RESULTS Of the 47 patients included in this study, all of them completed follow-up examinations, with a mean follow-up duration of 4.8 ± 1.6 months (range, 2-9 months). Significantly improved VAS and SF-36 scores were recorded after the initial treatment (P<0.001), suggesting that almost 100% of patients experienced pain relief and an improved quality of life following surgery. No major intervention-related complications (e.g., serious neurovascular injury or infection) occurred during or after the treatment. We recorded only three minor posttreatment complications (6.4%, 3/47), which were related to thermal injury that caused myofasciitis and affected wound healing. CONCLUSION In our study, the short-term efficacy of MWA was considerably favorable, with a relatively low rate of complications. Our results also showed that MWA was effective for pain relief and improved patients' quality of life, making it a feasible treatment alternative for bone tumors.","Wu, Min-Hao; Xiao, Ling-Fei; Yan, Fei-Fei; Chen, Shi-Liang; Zhang, Chong; Lei, Jun; Deng, Zhou-Ming",Cancer imaging : the official publication of the International Cancer Imaging Society,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40644-019-0275-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849340/,383

Given the novelty and scale of the disease, information surrounding COVID-19 has been marked by considerable uncertainty and confusion. Although various factors have been associated with COVID-19 distress, little is known about the relations between levels of intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and anxiety symptoms and behaviors. This cross-sectional study sought to examine potential correlates and pathways between anxiety and precautionary behaviors with the two levels of IU: prospective and inhibitory. Individuals from NYC (N = 99) completed an online survey through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Findings revealed that fear of COVID-19 accounts for associations between prospective IU and greater anxiety symptoms and behaviors, whereas precaution adherence accounts for associations between prospective IU and reduced anxiety symptoms and behaviors. In addition, precaution adherence accounts for associations between inhibitory IU and greater anxiety symptoms and behaviors. The results shed light on ways in which variations in IU may be associated with anxiety symptoms and behaviors in the context of COVID-19 and future pandemic scenarios.","Jiwani, Zishan; Cadwell, Olivia G; Parnes, McKenna; Brown, Adam D",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,https://doi.org/10.1097/nmd.0000000000001308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33512856/,383

Prediction rules for traumatic brain injury among children with minor head trauma have not been specifically evaluated in infants younger than 3 months old. We aimed to determine the risk of clinically important traumatic brain injuries, traumatic brain injuries on computed tomography (CT) images, and skull fractures in infants younger than 3 months of age who did and did not meet the age-specific Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) low-risk criteria for children with minor blunt head trauma. METHODS We conducted a secondary analysis of infants <3 months old in the public use data set from PECARN's prospective observational study of children with minor blunt head trauma. Main outcomes included (1) clinically important traumatic brain injury, (2) traumatic brain injury on CT, and (3) skull fracture on CT. RESULTS Of 10,904 patients <2 years old, 1,081 (9.9%) with complete data were <3 months old; most (750/1081, 69.6%) sustained falls, and 633/1081 (58.6%) underwent CT scans. Of the 514/1081 (47.5%) infants who met the PECARN low-risk criteria, 1/514 (0.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.005% to 1.1%), 10/197 (5.1%, 2.5% to 9.1%), and 9/197 (4.6%, 2.1% to 8.5%) had clinically important traumatic brain injuries, traumatic brain injuries on CT, and skull fractures, respectively. Of 567 infants who did not meet the low-risk PECARN criteria, 24/567 (4.2%, 95% CI 2.7% to 6.2%), 94/436 (21.3%, 95% CI 17.6% to 25.5%), and 122/436 (28.0%, 95% CI 23.8% to 32.5%) had clinically important traumatic brain injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and skull fractures, respectively. CONCLUSION The PECARN traumatic brain injury low-risk criteria accurately identified infants <3 months old at low risk of clinically important traumatic brain injuries. However, infants at low risk for clinically important traumatic brain injuries remained at risk for traumatic brain injuries on CT, suggesting the need for a cautious approach in these infants.","Abid, Zaynah; Kuppermann, Nathan; Tancredi, Daniel J; Dayan, Peter S",Annals of emergency medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.04.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34148662/,383

Notably, small animals have served to identify and validate many different approaches to countering infection with these highly pathogenic viruses. Nonetheless, predictive efficacy between each model does not appear to be equivalent as higher order animals seem to be more prognostic and therefore successful in the evaluation of medical countermeasures (MCM). Areas covered: This review comprehensively details the available small animal models of filovirus infection and discusses the benefits and shortcomings of each model with respect to the development of MCM. An up-to-date evaluation of mouse, hamster, guinea pig, and ferret models is provided. Expert opinion: The recent development of the domestic ferret model for ebolavirus offers a small animal model that faithfully reproduces most features of human disease without the need for viral adaptation or an immunocompromised host. That being said, choosing a small animal model to evaluate a particular MCM must consider potential confounders associated with each model. These confounding issues include incomplete host immune systems or mutations in the challenge virus that enables the disease.","Cross, Robert W; Fenton, Karla A; Geisbert, Thomas W",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2018.1527827; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30269599/,383

METHODS This is a retrospective study of 33 patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication between January 2009 and September 2010. RESULTS There were 15 SILS and 18 traditional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication procedures performed. The mean operative time was 129 and 182 minutes in the traditional laparoscopic and single-incision groups, respectively (P=.019). There were no conversions in the traditional laparoscopic group, whereas 6 of the 15 patients in the SILS group required conversion by insertion of 2 to 4 additional ports (P=.0004). At short-term follow-up, recurrence rates were similar between both groups. To date, there have been no reoperations. CONCLUSIONS SILS Nissen fundoplication is both safe and feasible.

However, no systematic surveillance for bat rabies has been carried out in India, a canine rabies endemic country with a high burden of human rabies. Surveillance for rabies virus (RABV) infection in bats was therefore carried out in Nagaland, a north-eastern state in India at sites with intense human-bat interfaces during traditional bat harvests. Brain tissues and sera from bats were tested for evidence of infection due to RABV. Brain tissues were subjected to the fluorescent antibody test for detection of viral antigen and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR for presence of viral RNA. Bat sera were tested for the presence of rabies neutralizing antibodies by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test. None of the bat brains tested (n = 164) were positive for viral antigen or viral RNA. However, rabies neutralizing antibodies were detected in 4/78 (5·1%) bat sera tested, suggesting prior exposure to RABV or related lyssaviruses. The serological evidence of lyssaviral infection in Indian bats may have important implications in disease transmission and rabies control measures, and warrant extensive bat surveillance to better define the prevalence of lyssaviral infection in bats.","Mani, R S; Dovih, D P; Ashwini, M A; Chattopadhyay, B; Harsha, P K; Garg, K M; Sudarshan, S; Puttaswamaiah, R; Ramakrishnan, U; Madhusudana, S N",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268817000310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28228179/,383

139212,Challenges in Predicting Cognitive Decline in Dementia with Lewy Bodies.,2021-03-29,"Hair graying depends on the altered presence and functionality of hair follicle melanocytes. Melanocyte stem cells (MelSCs) reside in the bulge of hair follicles and give rise to migrating and differentiating progeny during the anagen phase. Aging, genotoxic stress, redox stress, and multiple behavior-associated acute stressors have been seen to induce hair graying by depleting the MelSC pool, a phenomenon which is accompanied by ectopic pigmentation of these cells, followed by their depletion from the stem cell niche. This aberrant differentiation produces a state from which a return to stem cell-like quiescence appears to be lost. The cellular features of stress-induced hair graying have been extensively studied in murine models. Here we describe a method to assess and quantify human hair follicle MelSC differentiation by measuring ectopically pigmented MelSCs in isolated human hair follicles exposed to specific stress signal mediators. Ionizing radiation, hydrogen peroxide, and noradrenaline have been shown to cause hair graying in mice. We demonstrate here that isolated, ex vivo cultured human hair follicles exposed to these treatments display similar ectopic pigmentation within the bulge area which is accompanied by induction of differentiated melanocytic markers. This study suggests that as in murine models, stress signaling induces closely matching phenotypic changes in human hair follicles which can be monitored and studied as a surrogate model for early steps in human hair graying.","Rachmin, Inbal; Lee, Ju Hee; Zhang, Bing; Sefton, James; Jung, Inhee; Lee, Young In; Hsu, Ya-Chieh; Fisher, David E",Experimental dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/exd.14309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33598985/,383

However, renal artery stenting procedures have significantly increased as one approach to treat this clinical problem. Despite improvements in device design and technical performance of the procedure, the benefits and results of randomized clinical trials of renal artery stenting as a therapy remain confusing. Understanding the epidemiology, pathophysiology and natural history of renal artery stenosis are central to improving the outcomes of renal artery stenting. Developing both noninvasive and invasive predictive tools to better identify which patient will respond to renal revascularization will also be beneficial. In this article, we will present an overview of atherosclerotic renal artery disease. The results of renal artery stenting will be discussed and from this, the available noninvasive and invasive tools available to assess the clinical and hemodynamic significance of renal artery stenosis will be presented.","Margey, Ronan; Hynes, Brian G; Moran, Darragh; Kiernan, Thomas J; Jaff, Michael R",Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,https://doi.org/10.1586/erc.11.143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21985547/,383

Laboratory confirmation of measles virus (MV) RNA by real-time PCR provides a definitive diagnosis, and molecular analysis to determine the genotype is the only way to distinguish between wild-type and vaccine strains. This distinction is important since live attenuated vaccine strains are able to replicate in the patient and can be associated with rash and fever but are poorly transmissible, if at all. Prompt reporting of measles cases to local authorities, including differentiation between wild-type and vaccine strains, allows for optimal management and contact tracing. The development and validation of a multiplex real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rtRT-PCR) assay for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of the Moraten and Schwarz vaccine strains from presumptive wild-type MV in a format that can be easily implemented for high-throughput testing of patient samples are reported here. This assay is sensitive, specific, reproducible, and 100% accurate in comparison with the gold standard comparator assay.","Pabbaraju, Kanti; Gill, Kara; Wong, Anita A; Tipples, Graham A; Hiebert, Joanne; Severini, Alberto; Fonseca, Kevin; Tellier, Raymond",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01828-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760529/,383

Due to advancements in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment, cardiovascular mortality has fallen in recent years. Previous studies have evaluated the impact of traditional risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia and smoking. However, limited studies have been conducted to evaluate sex discrepancies among patients with cardiovascular disease. Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem placentally mediated disease, which usually arises after 32 weeks of gestation and classically presents with hypertension and proteinuria. Pre-eclampsia affects 2% to 8% of all pregnancies worldwide and is often complicated by fetal growth restriction. Women with a history of pre-eclampsia are at increased risk of future cardiovascular complications. Therefore, this topic is of significance to the cardiovascular health of over 300 million women worldwide. The goal of this review is to determine the association of pre-eclampsia and future cardiovascular risk and to explore the potential management options for these high-risk women.","Ahmed, Raheel; Dunford, Joseph; Mehran, Roxana; Robson, Stephen; Kunadian, Vijay",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2014.02.529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613324/,383
140144,Oral manifestations of COVID-19: Brief review.,2021-02-16,"BACKGROUND Housing instability is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recent studies indicate that eviction, which may affect a larger segment of the population than other forms of housing instability, is also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, these studies evaluate eviction across large areas, such as counties, so it remains unclear whether these patterns extend to individual-level pregnancy outcomes. METHODS We used data on a cohort of all singleton live births at a single Chicago hospital between March 2008 and March 2018 to investigate the associations between block-group eviction rates and individual adverse pregnancy outcomes. Eviction data were obtained from the Eviction Lab at Princeton University. Generalised estimating equations were used to estimate associations and account for correlations among individuals living in the same block groups. RESULTS Individuals living in block groups in the highest quartile for eviction filing rate were 1.17 times as likely to deliver preterm (95% CI: 1.08 to 1.27) and 1.13 times as likely to deliver a small for gestational age infant (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.25) as compared with individuals living in block groups in the lowest quartile. Further, tests for linear trend indicated that for each quartile increase in eviction filing rate, there was a corresponding increase in odds of adverse outcomes (p<0.05). Results were strongest in magnitude for those with low neighbourhood and individual socioeconomic status, who are most likely to be renters and affected by local eviction policies. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that individuals living in block groups with higher eviction rates are more likely to deliver preterm. Future research should explore associations of individual experience with eviction on adverse pregnancy outcomes and examine whether policies to improve tenant protections also impact pregnancy outcomes.","Freedman, Alexa A; Smart, Britney P; Keenan-Devlin, Lauren S; Borders, Ann; Ernst, Linda M; Miller, Gregory E",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-215377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34607891/,383

A single-surgeon's experience of performing components separation abdominal reconstruction and reinforcement with mesh in the difficult abdomen is presented. METHODS Medical records from patients undergoing components separation and reinforcement with hernia mesh at Royal Liverpool Hospital from 2009 to 2012 were reviewed. Patients were classified by the Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG) grading system. Co-morbidities, previous surgeries, specific type of reconstruction technique, discharge date, complications and hernia recurrence were recorded. RESULTS Twenty-three patients' (15 males, 8 females) notes were reviewed. Median age was 57 years (range 20-76 years). Median follow-up at the time of review was 17 months (range 2-48 months). There were 13 grade III hernias and 10 grade IV hernias identified. Synthetic mesh was placed to reinforce the abdomen in 6 patients, cross-linked porcine dermis was used in 3, and a Biodesign® Hernia Graft was placed in 14. Complications included wound infection (13%), superficial wound dehiscence (22%), seroma formation (22%) and stoma complications (9%). To date, hernias have recurred in 3 patients (13%).

Furthermore, this study investigated how social support, as a factor that reduces depression among older adults, mediates the relationship between depression and suicidal ideation. METHODS Based on a survey of 260 older adults in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, suicidal ideation, depression, and social support were evaluated using the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, the Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and the Measurement of Social Support in the Elderly, respectively. RESULTS A multiple regression analysis confirmed that depression and social support were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. Based on path analysis, we found that social support mediated the relationship between depression and suicidal ideation.

Different blends of polymers were tested to achieve low-temperature printing filaments, which are flexible and durable to be wound onto spools. The mechanical properties of filaments were compared with commercial filaments and evaluated by bending tests. Kollidon 12PF, PEG 4000, and PEO 900k blends resulted in promising filaments that could be extruded at 70°C and had flexibility similar to commercial PLA filaments. Montelukast sodium (MS), which undergoes hepatic first-pass metabolism, was compounded into polymer blends, and drug-loaded filaments were extruded. All filaments were tested with a 3D printing pen prior to using with the 3D printer for transdermal patches. MS loaded filaments and patches showed similar flexibility with placebo. In vitro drug release studies showed 52% of MS was released in 24 hours. Printing on disposable packaging material is presented for the first time with this study.

Synergistic effects may decrease required concentrations and shorten exposure durations for treatments. We investigated four toxicants (EarthTec QZ, Clam-Trol CT-2, niclosamide, and potassium chloride) that have been considered to control invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha Pallas, 1771). We determined the toxicity of binary mixtures for five different mixture ratios to adult mussels. We compared our observations to predictions made with concentration addition and independent action paradigms, as based on the dose-response relationships of each individual toxicant. We calculated the model deviation ratio for each combination at the LC50 and LC90 and identified three possible interactions: synergy, antagonism, and additivity. We found that mixtures of niclosamide and Clam-Trol CT-2 were the most synergistic while mixtures that included potassium chloride were largely additive to antagonistic. The use of synergistic combinations has potential to decrease the overall volume and concentration of individual toxicants required for dreissenid mussel treatments, thereby decreasing cost.","Barbour, Matthew T; Schueller, Justin R; Severson, Todd J; Wise, Jeremy K; Meulemans, Matthew J; Luoma, James A; Waller, Diane L",Aquatic toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.105934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399323/,383

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. ANIMALS 32 horses. PROCEDURES Information was retrieved from medical records and through telephone calls on horses that had a hand-sewn or stapled side-to-side jejunocecostomy for treatment of colic, which was performed by or under the supervision of the same surgeon. Kaplan-Meier life table analysis was used to compare survival times and rates between horses that underwent a hand-sewn or stapled side-to-side anastomosis. RESULTS 32 horses met inclusion criteria; 22 underwent a hand-sewn anastomosis, and 10 underwent a stapled anastomosis. Horses in the stapled group had a significantly greater prevalence of postoperative colic and combined postoperative colic and reflux than horses in the hand-sewn group. In the hand-sewn group, repeated celiotomy was performed within the same hospitalization period for 3 of 22 horses; in the stapled group, 4 of 10 horses had repeated celiotomies. Hospital discharge rates (ie, short-term survival rates) were similar between horses in the hand-sewn group (20/22 horses) and those in the stapled group (9/10 horses). Long-term survival rates were similar for both groups, ranging from 5 to 126 months. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Short- and long-term results justify use of jejunocecostomy in horses. Despite similar survival rates between groups, horses that underwent a stapled anastomosis had significantly greater prevalences of postoperative complications than horses that underwent a hand-sewn anastomosis, suggesting that horses were sensitive to minor differences in anastomosis techniques.","Freeman, David E; Schaeffer, David J",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.237.9.1060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21034346/,383

151277,Expansion of Patient Education Programming Regarding Live Donor Liver Transplantation via Virtual Group Encounters During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-01-31,"In multicellular and even single-celled organisms, individual components are interconnected at multiscale levels to produce enormously complex biological networks that help these systems maintain homeostasis for development and environmental adaptation. Systems biology studies initially adopted network analysis to explore how relationships between individual components give rise to complex biological processes. Network analysis has been applied to dissect the complex connectivity of mammalian brains across different scales in time and space in The Human Brain Project. In plant science, network analysis has similarly been applied to study the connectivity of plant components at the molecular, subcellular, cellular, organic, and organism levels. Analysis of these multiscale networks contributes to our understanding of how genotype determines phenotype. In this review, we summarized the theoretical framework of plant multiscale networks and introduced studies investigating plant networks by various experimental and computational modalities. We next discussed the currently available analytic methodologies and multi-level imaging techniques used to map multiscale networks in plants. Finally, we highlighted some of the technical challenges and key questions remaining to be addressed in this emerging field.","Zhang, Xi; Man, Yi; Zhuang, Xiaohong; Shen, Jinbo; Zhang, Yi; Cui, Yaning; Yu, Meng; Xing, Jingjing; Wang, Guangchao; Lian, Na; Hu, Zijian; Ma, Lingyu; Shen, Weiwei; Yang, Shunyao; Xu, Huimin; Bian, Jiahui; Jing, Yanping; Li, Xiaojuan; Li, Ruili; Mao, Tonglin; Jiao, Yuling; Sodmergen,; Ren, Haiyun; Lin, Jinxing",Science China.

151358,A Rising Tide: No Hospital Is an Island Unto Itself in the Era of COVID-19.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Critical hypoxia in this COVID-19 pandemic results in high mortality and economic loss worldwide. Initially, this disease' pathophysiology was poorly understood and interpreted as a SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) pneumonia. The severe atypical lung CAT scan images alerted all countries, including the poorest, to purchase lacking sophisticated ventilators. However, 88% of the patients on ventilators lost their lives. It was suggested that COVID-19 could be similar to a High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE). New observations and pathological findings are gradually clarifying the disease. METHODS As high-altitude medicine and hypoxia physiology specialists from the highlands, we perform a perspective analysis of hypoxic diseases treated at high altitude and compare them to Covid-19. Oxygen transport physiology, SARSCov-2 characteristics, and its transmission, lung imaging in COVID-19, and HAPE, as well as the causes of clinical signs and symptoms, are discussed. RESULTS High-altitude oxygen transport physiology has been systematically ignored. COVID-19 signs and symptoms indicate a progressive and irreversible failure in the oxygen transport system, secondary to pneumolysis produced by SARS-Cov-2's alveolar-capillary membrane ""attack"". HAPE's pulmonary compromise is treatable and reversible. COVID-19 is associated with several diseases, with different individual outcomes, in different countries, and at different altitudes.","Zubieta-Calleja, Gustavo R; Zubieta-DeUrioste, Natalia; Venkatesh, Thuppil; Das, Kusal; Soliz, Jorge",Reviews on recent clinical trials,https://doi.org/10.2174/1574887115666200925141108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32981508/,383

152348,"From COVID-19 to cancer, watching social determinants decide life: When will we stop spectating?",2021-03-13,"OBJECTIVES To understand and report the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on radiology residents in Saudi Arabia with respect to their education, clinical activities, and personal well-being. METHODS The survey questionnaire was designed by a team of experts based on a review of the literature and was distributed electronically through the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties to residents registered in all radiology residency training programs in Saudi Arabia during the academic year 2019 to 2020. Categorical variables were presented as counts and percentage. Numerical variables were presented as mean and standard deviation if normally distributed. Chi-square testing was used to compare categorical variables with the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Spearman correlation was used to correlate numerical variables at the level of significance p-value < 0.05. RESULTS A total of 109 residents completed the online survey during the study period, with a response rate of 32.2% (109/337). The mean age was 27.3 years (standard deviation, 1.86). The majority of respondents (71.5%, 78/109) reported either a severe or moderate negative impact on educational activities. Also, the majority (73.4%, 80/109) reported either a minimal or moderate negative impact on clinical activities. Residents training in the western province perceived a statistically higher negative impact on educational activities compared to their peers in other regions (p = 0.01). Residents in their second year of residency training perceived a statistically higher negative impact on their participation in clinical activities (p = 0.014). Less than half of the respondents (45.9%, 50/109) reported that they were redeployed to work in another department. The majority (80%, 40/50) reported a negative impact on their well-being. CONCLUSION The majority of radiology residents in Saudi Arabia reported a negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their education, clinical activities, and personal well-being. Our study also identified and explored some of the innovative solutions and strategies implemented by the training programs and the SCFHS to mitigate the negative effects on trainees.","Alhasan, Ayman S; Alahmadi, Shahad M; Altayeb, Yara A; Daqqaq, Tareef S",Academic radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2021.03.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33893029/,383
152513,Psycho-Oncology: A Bibliometric Review of the 100 Most-Cited Articles.,2021-08-06,"BACKGROUND Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an illness caused by a coronavirus in which infected persons develop severe acute respiratory illness. A person can be infected through close contacts. This is an outbreak investigation report of the first confirmed MERS case in the Philippines and the subsequent contact tracing activities. METHODS Review of patient records and interviews with health-care personnel were done. Patient and close contacts were tested for MERS-coronavirus (CoV) by real time-polymerase chain reaction. Close contacts were identified and categorized. All traced contacts were monitored daily for appearance of illness for 14 days starting from the date of last known exposure to the confirmed case. A standard log sheet was used for symptom monitoring. RESULTS The case was a 31-year-old female who was a health-care worker in Saudi Arabia. She had mild acute respiratory illness five days before travelling to the Philippines. On 1 February, she travelled with her husband to the Philippines while she had a fever. On 2 February, she attended a health facility in the Philippines. On 8 February, respiratory samples were tested for MERS-CoV and yielded positive results. A total of 449 close contacts were identified, and 297 (66%) were traced. Of those traced, 15 developed respiratory symptoms. All of them tested negative for MERS. DISCUSSION In this outbreak investigation, the participation of health-care personnel in conducting vigorous contact tracing may have reduced the risk of transmission. However, being overly cautious to include more contacts for the outbreak response should be further reconsidered.","Racelis, Sheryl; de los Reyes, Vikki Carr; Sucaldito, Ma Nemia; Deveraturda, Imelda; Roca, John Bobbie; Tayag, Enrique",Western Pacific surveillance and response journal : WPSAR,https://doi.org/10.5365/wpsar.2015.6.2.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26668760/,383
152949,Proposal of New Radiological Classification and Treatment Strategy for Transverse Fractures of the C2 Axis Body.,2021-05-27,"OBJECTIVE To determine public health and cost consequences of time delays to EVT for patients, healthcare systems, and society, we estimated quality-adjusted life years (QALY) of EVT-treated patients and associated costs based on times to treatment. METHODS The Markov model analysis was performed from United States healthcare and societal perspectives over a lifetime horizon. Contemporary data from seven trials within the HERMES collaboration served as data source. Aside from cumulative lifetime costs, we calculated the net monetary benefit (NMB) to determine the economic value of care. We used a contemporary willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY for NMB calculations. RESULTS Every 10 minutes of earlier treatment resulted in an average gain of 39 days (95% prediction interval: 23-53 days) of disability-free life. Overall, the cumulative lifetime costs for patients with earlier or later treatment were similar. Patients with later treatment had higher morbidity-related costs yet over a shorter time span due to their shorter life expectancy, resulting in similar lifetime costs as in patients with early treatment. Regarding the economic value of care, every 10 minutes of earlier treatment increased the NMB by $10,593 (95% prediction interval: $5,549-$14,847) and by $10,915 (95% prediction interval: $5,928-$15,356) taking healthcare and societal perspectives, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Any time delay to EVT reduces QALYs and decreases the economic value of care provided by this intervention. Healthcare policies to implement efficient pre-hospital triage and accelerate in-hospital workflow are urgently needed.","Kunz, Wolfgang G; Hunink, Myriam G; Almekhlafi, Mohammed A; Menon, Bijoy K; Saver, Jeffrey L; Dippel, Diederik W J; Majoie, Charles B L M; Jovin, Tudor G; Davalos, Antoni; Bracard, Serge; Guillemin, Francis; Campbell, Bruce C V; Mitchell, Peter J; White, Philip; Muir, Keith W; Brown, Scott; Demchuk, Andrew M; Hill, Michael D; Goyal, Mayank",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000010867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32943483/,383
153243,The impact of COVID-19 telephone consultations on renal clinic non-attendance.,2021-03-01,"Background: COVID-19 is known to be associated with a distinct form of coagulopathy. Objective: To describe the imaging manifestations of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy in hospitalized patients, across anatomic sites and modalities, and to identify clinical variables associated with positive imaging findings. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of a consecutive series of adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital over a 3-week period. Patient demographics, hematologic values, cross-sectional imaging examinations, and clinical outcomes (death and intubation) were collected. Imaging was reviewed for imaging manifestations of coagulopathy. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess for associations of patient demographics, hematologic markers, and outcomes, with the conduct of imaging and imaging manifestations of coagulopathy. Results: Among 308 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 46% underwent cross-sectional imaging for a total of 332 included cross-sectional imaging examinations. A total of 26% (37/142) of patients demonstrated imaging positive for coagulopathy. The most common such imaging manifestations were pulmonary embolus (n=21) on contrast-enhanced CT or CTA, thrombus in the upper or lower extremity veins (n=13) on Doppler US, end organ infarction in the bowel (n=4) and kidney (n=4) on contrast-enhanced CT, and thrombus or parenchymal infarction in the brain (n=2) on contrast-enhanced CTA or MRI with MRA. Among patients with imaging positive for coagulopathy, 22% (8/37) had multi-site involvement. Thrombi were multifocal in 4 of 5 patients with positive upper and 3 of 8 patients with positive lower extremity examinations and involved both superficial and/or deep veins. In multivariable analysis, intubation (p<0.001) and prolonged prothrombin time (p=0.04) showed a significant association with undergoing imaging; no patient variable was significantly associated with imaging positive for coagulopathy (p>0.05). Conclusion: Imaging commonly demonstrates manifestations of coagulopathy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In patients with such manifestations, over a fifth demonstrate multi-site involvement. Clinical variables poorly predict which patients have positive imaging, indicating a complementary role of imaging in detecting COVID-19 associated coagulopathy. Clinical Impact: In patients with COVID-19, CT pulmonary angiogram, extremity Doppler US, contrast-enhanced abdomen CT, and contrast-enhanced brain MRI and MRA may all be appropriate if systemic coagulopathy is suspected, in the absence of imaging contraindications.","O'Shea, Aileen; Parakh, Anushri; Hedgire, Sandeep; Lee, Susanna I",AJR.

METHODS A novel but simple technique to achieve fast reduction in clot burden in stroke patients with occlusion of the internal carotid artery termination is described where manual suction using a 60-ml syringe applied through an 8-F balloon guide catheter positioned in the cervical carotid vasculature with proximal flow arrest allows subsequent revascularization of the residual middle cerebral artery clot. RESULTS The use of manual suction through a balloon-tipped guide catheter in internal carotid artery L- or T-type occlusion is illustrated. This resulted in a significant reduction of the clot burden and facilitated further interventions leading to full recanalization. CONCLUSION Manual suction using a 60-ml syringe through a balloon guide catheter is a useful and feasible technique that facilitates thrombectomy of large burden cerebral clots.","Eesa, Muneer; Almekhlafi, Mohammed A; Mitha, Alim P; Wong, John H; Goyal, Mayank",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-012-1039-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22552837/,383

However, conspicuous consumption often does not represent social and environmental values, because their products are often not characterized by being made through sustainable processes. United Nations, through its sustainable development agenda, invited companies to be aware of the social and environmental problems of the world and to be able to generate strategies that can be sustainable over time and allow the growth of both the company and society in general. This study analyses the case of Starbucks as a global and sustainable brand, which also generates conspicuous consumption in emerging markets. In this way, we explain how this brand generates a social status in emerging markets, which allow their consumers to excel socially. On the other hand, we explain how Starbucks contributes positively to sustainability in these types of markets, generating greater well-being for both the environment and society in general. In this way, this brand manages to transmit messages with symbolic values of social status, as well as social and environmental awareness. This research allows us to see how Starbucks is able to generate conspicuous consumption in Colombia, which is the third largest exporter of coffee in the world but is also capable of generating sustainable processes that help Colombian coffee growers and the environment. This research used a quantitative methodology based on a structured questionnaire made for conspicuous consumers of the Starbucks brand in Colombia, whose data were processed through the statistical program PLS 3.2.7. This research details the sustainable processes carried out by this brand in this developing country and the reasons why its consumption in this emerging market is considered conspicuous. For this research, family allocentrism, ethnocentrism, and patriotism are considered antecedents of conspicuous consumption, and brand image and brand loyalty are considered their results.","Areiza-Padilla, Jose Andres; Manzi Puertas, Mario Andres",Frontiers in psychology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.662950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34489786/,383

Uncertainty about a patient's COVID-19 status risks infecting health care workers and non-COVID-19 inpatients. We evaluated the use of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) screening for COVID-19 on admission for all patients with fractures. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients older than 18 years admitted with low-energy fractures who were tested by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 at any time during hospitalization. Two periods based on the applied testing protocol were defined. During the first period, patients were only tested because of epidemiological criteria or clinical suspicion based on fever, respiratory symptoms, or radiological findings. In the second period, all patients admitted for fracture treatment were screened by RT-qPCR. RESULTS We identified 15 patients in the first period and 42 in the second. In total, 9 (15.8%) patients without clinical or radiological findings tested positive at any moment. Five (33.3%) patients tested positive postoperatively in the first period and 3 (7.1%) in the second period (P = 0.02). For clinically unsuspected patients, postoperative positive detection went from 3 of 15 (20%) during the first period to 2 of 42 (4.8%) in the second (P = 0.11). Clinical symptoms demonstrated high specificity (92.1%) but poor sensitivity (52.6%) for infection detection. CONCLUSIONS Symptom-based screening for COVID-19 has shown to be specific but not sensitive. Negative clinical symptoms do not rule out infection. Protocols and separated areas are necessary to treat infected patients. RT-qPCR testing on admission helps minimize the risk of nosocomial and occupational infection.

We aim to present: (1) the criteria established by the Surgery Management Committee of Taipei Veterans General Hospital in response to COVID-19 and (2) the impact of COVID-19 screening on orthopedic trauma patients in the emergency department. METHODS From April 1 to April 30, 2020, all orthopedic trauma patients in the emergency department were screened for COVID-19 if they fulfilled any of the following: (1) travel from abroad within 14 days; (2) high-risk occupation; (3) contact or cluster history with a COVID-19-positive patient; (4) any associated symptom, including fever up to 38°C, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, loss of taste or smell, muscle soreness, malaise or shortness of breath. We recorded details on the injury, fever, management and associated outcomes. RESULTS Of the 163 orthopedic trauma patients presenting to the emergency department, 24 were screened for COVID-19; of these, 22 received surgery. Sixty-two patients received surgery without screening for COVID-19. Fever was the most common reason to screen for COVID-19 (N=20, 83.3%). No patients were COVID-19 positive. Screened patients had a significantly longer mean interval from presentation to the emergency department to surgery (2.7±2.5 vs. 1.5±0.8 days, p=0.037).Of the 20 patients screened because of fever, the focus was not identified in 12 (60.0%) patients. The other eight had urinary tract infection (N=6, 27.2%), septic hip (N=1, 4.6%) and concomitant pneumonia and urinary tract infection (N=1, 4.6%). The mean duration of fever and hospital stay was 4.3±4.6 and 8.7±4.9 days, respectively. There were no thromboembolic events, surgical complications or in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION We developed safe and reliable screening criteria for this COVID-19 pandemic.

Organisms that have crossed the species barrier from animals to humans include viruses such as Hendra, Nipah, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and influenza, as well as bacteria and others. Brain CT and MR imaging findings have included cortical abnormalities, microinfarction in the white matter, large-vessel occlusion, and features of meningitis. In particular, the high sensitivity of diffusion-weighted MR imaging in detecting intracranial abnormalities has been helpful in outbreaks. Although the coronaviruses causing the previous Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak and the current coronavirus disease 19 pandemic are related, it is important to be aware of their similarities as well as potential differences. This review describes the neuroimaging appearances of selected zoonotic outbreaks so that neuroradiologists can better understand the current pandemic and potential future outbreaks.","Goh, G X; Tan, K; Ang, B S P; Wang, L-F; Tchoyoson Lim, C C",AJNR.

The present study examined the direct and indirect relationships between eating disorder symptoms and the four maintaining processes: perfectionism, low core self-esteem, mood intolerance, and interpersonal difficulties. METHOD Using a correlational cross-sectional design, adolescents with eating disorders (N = 270; anorexia nervosa [restricting; 35.9%]; anorexia nervosa [binge purge; 8.1%]; bulimia nervosa [9.3%]; atypical anorexia nervosa [27.4%]; bulimia nervosa [of low frequency and/or limited duration; 3%]; purging [1.1%]; and unspecified feeding or eating disorders [15.2%]) completed measures of perfectionism, self-esteem, mood intolerance, interpersonal difficulties, and eating disorder symptoms as part of the intake assessment to an eating disorders program. RESULTS Path analysis revealed that low self-esteem and mood intolerance were directly associated with eating disorder symptoms. Perfectionism was indirectly associated with eating disorder symptoms through self-esteem and mood intolerance. DISCUSSION The findings provide partial support for the transdiagnostic model of eating disorders in an adolescent clinical sample. In particular, core low self-esteem and mood intolerance were found to be pertinent in adolescents with eating disorders. A limitation of the current study was the use of cross-sectional data. Future research should examine the transdiagnostic model with the use of longitudinal data. Furthermore, future research is required to examine potential differences in the way the maintaining mechanisms operate between adolescents and adults with eating disorders and the implications for treatment.","Jones, Emily J; Egan, Sarah J; Howell, Joel A; Hoiles, Kimberley J; Mazzucchelli, Trevor G",Eating behaviors,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2020.101445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142128/,383

159923,Violence against Jordanian Women during COVID-19 Outbreak.,2020-11-07,"An infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) with an unusual enteric tropism (CalEnt) was isolated from a California broiler flock exhibiting runting-stunting syndrome. IBV was detected in the small intestine, but not in the respiratory tract or kidney. During virus isolation in embryos, it did not replicate in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) but could be recovered from intestines. Its S1 protein showed 93% amino acid sequence identity to a California variant isolated in 1999 (Cal99). Intestinal lesions were reproduced following ocular/nasal inoculation of specific-pathogen-free chickens, but respiratory signs and lesions were also present. The virus was detected in both respiratory and intestinal tissues. To determine whether the novel tropism of IBV CalEnt was due to an increased ability of its S1 protein to bind to the intestinal epithelium, we compared the binding of soluble trimeric recombinant S1 proteins derived from CalEnt and Cal99 to chicken tissues. Contrary to expectations, the CalEnt S1 protein did not bind to small intestine and, unlike Cal99 S1, did not bind to the respiratory epithelium or CAM. Using only the CalEnt S1 N-terminal domain or including the S2 ectodomain (lacking membrane and cytoplasmic domains), which have been shown to improve ArkDPI S1 protein binding, did not lead to detectable binding at the standard protein concentration to any tissue tested. Our results indicate no/poor binding of the CalEnt spike protein to both respiratory and intestinal tissues and thus do not support better attachment to intestinal epithelial cells as a reason for CalEnt's extended tropism. These results might reflect shortcomings of the assay, including that it does not detect potential contributions of the S1 C-terminal domain to attachment. We used bioinformatic approaches to explore the possibility that the unique tropism of CalEnt might be a result of functions of the S protein in cell-entry steps subsequent to attachment. These analyses suggest that CalEnt's S2 coding region was acquired through a recombination event and encodes a unique amino acid sequence at the putative recognition site for the protease that activates the S protein for fusion. Thus, S2 activation by tissue-specific proteases might facilitate CalEnt entry into intestinal epithelial cells and compensate for poor binding by its S1 protein.","Saiada, Farjana; Gallardo, Rodrigo A; Shivaprasad, H L; Corsiglia, Charles; Van Santen, Vicky L",Avian diseases,https://doi.org/10.1637/0005-2086-64.1.23; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32267122/,383

This study used survey data to estimate how many young Australians may be prepared to use cannabis if it became legally available. DESIGN AND METHODS The study included 3052 youths (adolescents aged 12-17 and young adults aged 18-25 years) in Australia who participated in the 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey. Incident cases were estimated by multiplying the prevalence and estimated population sizes from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. RESULTS It was estimated that 17% of adolescents would try (13%) or use (4%), and 32% of young adults would try (15%) or use (17%) cannabis if it were legal. Among those who reported an intention to try it, 85% of adolescents and 59% of young adults had never used cannabis. These translate to 199 000 and 238 000 potential initiators, respectively. Among those with an intention to use cannabis, 21% of adolescents and 3% of young adults had never used cannabis. These translate to 14 000 adolescents and 12 000 young adults who intended to use cannabis if it were legal. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS A substantial minority of young Australians say that they would use cannabis for the first time if it were legalised. A proportion of young people who have used cannabis also expressed an interest in increasing their use. Both would warrant special attention if cannabis were legalised.","Leung, Janni; Chiu, Vivian; Chung, Jack Yiu Chak; Hall, Wayne D; Chan, Gary C K",Drug and alcohol review,https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.13124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726481/,383

As a revolutionary alternative to a conventional distribution channel, this paper proposes an omni-channel strategy. The omni-channel aims to maximize the customer shopping experience by diversifying and integrating the product purchase and delivery media through customer engagement. The omni-channel also facilitates the sales of products by allowing customers to seamlessly interact with retailers across the multiple channels such as websites, social media, brick-and-mortar stores, kiosks, call centers, and the like. Since the transformation of product sale, purchase, and delivery processes requires a new business mindset and innovative strategic initiatives, this paper sheds light on potential challenges and opportunities of implementing the omni-channel strategy, while identifying key success factors for the application of the omni-channel concept to e-tailing.","Min, H.",Logistics-Basel,https://doi.org/10.3390/logistics5020031,383

Methods Routine blood results from 8,031 patients with heart failure, with equal number of controls, were used in ML training and testing datasets (Split 80:20). NT-proBNP was used for diagnostic comparison. rawFBC metadata was used in a dataset of 698 patients, 314 of whom had heart failure, to train and test ML models (Split 70:30) from rawFBC, rawFBC plus biochemistry and routine bloods. The rawFBC model was used to predict heart failure in a validation dataset of 69,492 FBCs (2.3% heart failure prevalence). Results Heart failure was predicted from rawFBC and biochemistry versus rawFBC AUROC 0.93 versus 0.91, 95% CI -0.023 to 0.048, P = 0.5, and predicted from routine bloods and NT-proBNP, AUROC 0.87 versus 0.81, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.097, P = 0.03. In the validation cohort heart failure was predicted from rawFBC with AUROC 0.83, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.84, P < 0.001, sensitivity 75%, specificity 76%, PPV 7%, NPV 99.2% (Figure 2). Elevated NT-proBNP ([≥] 34 pmol/L) was predicted from rawFBC with AUROC 0.97, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.99, P < 0.0001. Common predictive features included markers of erythropoiesis (red cell distribution width, haemoglobin, haematocrit). Conclusion Heart failure can be predicted from routine bloods with accuracy equivalent to NT-proBNP.

We conducted a pilot study to determine the reasons for non-attendance and explore their acceptance of human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling as an alternative to Pap test. Methods: A two-part cross-sectional study was conducted at a health centre in Brunei, from January to December 2019. Women who were eligible for a Pap test but who either never or did not have one within the past four years were conveniently recruited. Participants were first asked to complete a paper-based survey on their reasons for screening non-attendance, and then invited for HPV self-sampling. Results were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Result: We enrolled 174 screening non-attendees, out of which 97 (55.7%) also participated in HPV self-sampling. The main reasons for not attending Pap test screening were fear of bad results (16.1%, n = 28); embarrassment (14.9%, n = 26) and lack of time due to home commitments (10.3%, n = 18). When compared to those who agreed to participate in HPV self-sampling, those who declined were significantly older (p = 0.002) and less likely to agree that they are susceptible to cervical cancer (p = 0.023). They preferred to receive Pap-test related information from healthcare workers (59.0%, n = 155), social messaging platforms (28.7%, n = 51) and social media (26.4%, n = 47). HPV self-sampling kits were positively-received, where > 90% agreed on its ease and convenience. Nine of 97 participants (9.3%) tested positive for hr-HPV, out of which eight were non-16/18 HPV genotypes. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that promoting knowledge on cervical cancer, the benefits of screening and clarifying any misconceptions of Pap test results would help increase screening uptake among Bruneian non-attendees. Response to HPV self-sampling was highly positive, implying its receptiveness in the local setting. Our high detection of non-16/18 HPV genotypes suggest high prevalence of other hr-HPV genotypes in Brunei. Larger studies can be conducted to further validate our findings.","Chaw, L.; Lee, S.

Objectives: To evaluate sleep quality and its associated factors in adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Methods: This is a population-based serological survey of 1762 adults collected from October to December 2020 in the Iron Quadrangle region, Brazil. To measure sleep quality, we used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and socio-demographic, health, health related behaviors, anxiety, vitamin D, weight gain/loss, and pandemic characteristics were assessed using a structured questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with sleep quality. Results: More than half of the individuals evaluated had poor sleep quality (52.5%). In multivariate analysis, factors related to sleep quality included living alone (OR=2.36; 95%CI: 1.11-5.00), anxiety disorder (OR=2.22; 95%CI: 1.20-4.14), 5.0% weight loss during the pandemic (OR=1.66; 95%CI: 1.01-2.76), weight gain of 5.0% (OR=1.90; 95%CI: 1.08-3.34), insufficient vitamin D scenario (OR=1.47; 95%CI: 1.01-2.12), and symptoms of COVID-19 (OR=1.94; 95%CI: 1.25-3.01). Conclusions: Our study revealed that more than half of the participants had poor sleep quality during the COVID-19 outbreak, and the factors associated with poor sleep quality were related to the pandemic, such as insufficient vitamin D scenario and weight change.","Menezes-Junior, L.

169419,Impact of COVID-19 on initial treatment of breast and colorectal cancers in one integrated healthcare system,2021,"Study Objective To characterize how surgical delays and cancellations experienced by patients needing gynecologic surgery differed during the coronavirus pandemic compared to pre-pandemic and determine if the delay and cancellation rates varied based on the patient's race, ethnicity or insurance type. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Urban, academic, tertiary care medical center. Patients or Participants Women aged >18 years who underwent surgery for benign or malignant gynecologic conditions. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results Pre-COVID included surgeries performed between 3/2019-2/2020 and COVID included surgeries between 3/2020-2/2021. In the pre-COVID group, 1107 cases had no surgical delay (75.3%), 364 cases had surgical delay or cancellation (24.7%). In the COVD group, 1042 cases had no surgical delay (75.5%), 339 cases had surgical delay or cancellation (24.5%). Of delayed surgeries, there was a significant difference in the median number of days to surgery in the COVID-19 group of 31.2 days (13.9-56.0) as compared to the pre-COVID group 14.0 days (7.0-34.8) (p<0.01). Among cases scheduled during the COVID-19 pandemic, after controlling for the urgency of the case, there was no significant association between insurance type, race or ethnicity and the likelihood of having surgery delayed or canceled (OR 0.82,CI 0.64-1.05,p=0.12; OR 0.97,CI 0.73-1.29,p=0.34; OR 1.08,CI 0.58-2.20,p=0.81). Regardless of insurance, race or ethnicity, elective cases during COVID-19 were more likely to be delayed or canceled compared to urgent or emergent cases (OR 1.68, CI 1.07-2.63, p=0.03; OR 1.66, CI 1.06-2.60, p=0.03, OR 1.71, CI 1.08-2.70, p=0.02). Conclusion At a single academic center, while COVID was associated with increased length of surgical delays, case urgency seemed to play a more important role than insurance status, race, and ethnicity in predicting which patients would have their case delayed. The surgical field has documented disparities for decades and it is incredibly important to continue to challenge our role in patient's access to care, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Elsahy, D.

The number of those who have suffered mentally due to the pandemic is well above this number. The virus, lockdowns, forced quarantines, and problems related to jobs and everyday functioning have left their mark on mental health. Additionally, the massive spread of COVID-19 content of varying quality in social media is exacerbating this impact. On the other hand, in times of social distancing, these media are an important link with other people and a source of social support. The impact of the COVID-19 content in social media still requires further exploring. This influence on mental health may also vary geographically. There are more and more reports of discrimination against Asians due to COVID-19. We conducted a survey during lockdown in which 1664 respondents took part. After analyzing the impact of COVID-19 content in social media on the level of life satisfaction, anxiety, and depression, we compared this impact between European and Asian respondents. The results showed that dealing with these contents affects the level of anxiety, depression, and life satisfaction. Although most often these relations turned out to be negative, we have also identified those indicating a positive impact. This was particularly noticeable among Asian respondents, who additionally showed a lower relationship between reading COVID-19 content and their mental well-being than European respondents.","Jabłońska, Marta R.; Zajdel, Karolina Zajdel Radosław",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13169198,383

However, studies evaluating accurate detection are still required. This study evaluated the quantitativeness and sensitivity of the Ampdirect™ 2019-nCoV detection kit, a direct PCR method. Using saliva with or without Tris-buffered saline (TBS) dilution, linearity, and limits of the N1 and N2 regions of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA were assessed using EDX SARS-CoV-2 RNA standard dissolved in RNase-free water (RFW). Fluorescence intensities in non-diluted saliva were higher than those in TBS-diluted samples. Linear regression analysis of detected quantification cycle values and spiked standard RNA concentrations showed that the coefficient of determination of the N1 and N2 genes was 0.972 and 0.615 in RFW and 0.947 and 0.660 in saliva, respectively. N1- and N2-positive detection rates in saliva were 46% (6/13 tests) and 0% (0/12 tests) at one copy/reaction, respectively. These results indicate good quantitativeness and sensitivity for N1 but not for N2. Therefore, our findings reveal that the Ampdirect™ 2019-nCoV system, especially targeting the N1 gene, enables rapid and convenient quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva at one copy/reaction.","Deura, Chikaya Nakayama Kenji",Epidemiologia,https://doi.org/10.3390/epidemiologia2030023,383

The same exponential dynamics has been observed between January and March, 2021. The forecast of new cases and death recorded daily is crucial so that health experts and citizens can be guided in order to avoid escalation of the pandemic. We propose a deterministic method to predict the basic reproduction number Ro of first and second wave of COVID-19 cases in Kuwait and also to forecast the daily new cases and death of the pandemic in the country. Forecasting has been done using ARIMA model, Exponential smoothing model, Holts method, Prophet forecasting model and machine learning models like log-linear, polynomial and support vector regressions. The results presented aligned with other methods used to predict Ro in first and second waves and the forecasting clearly shows the trend of the pandemic in Kuwait. The deterministic prediction of Ro is a good forecasting tool available during the exponential phase of the contagion, which shows an increasing trend during the beginning of the first and second waves of the pandemic in Kuwait.","Oshinubi, K.; Al-Awadhi, F.; Rachdi, M.; Demongeot, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.24.21261059v1?rss=1,383

There are urgent demands on equipping cobots with safe collaboration, immersive teleoperation, affective interaction, and other features (e.g., energy autonomy and self-learning) to make cobots capable of these application scenarios. Robot skin, as a potential enabler, is able to boost the development of cobots to address these distinguishing features from the perspective of multimodal sensing and self-contained actuation. This review introduces the potential applications of cobots for human care together with those demanded features. In addition, the explicit roles of robot skin in satisfying the escalating demands of those features on inherent safety, sensory feedback, natural interaction, and energy autonomy are analyzed. Furthermore, a comprehensive review of the recent progress in functionalized robot skin in components level, including proximity, pressure, temperature, sensory feedback, and stiffness tuning, is presented. Results show that the codesign of these sensing and actuation functionalities may enable robot skin to provide improved safety, intuitive feedback, and natural interfaces for future cobots in human care applications.

This article presents implementation science, readiness assessments, and ongoing evaluation as central and integral to all efforts that seek to transform punitive schools into restorative schools. The author first presents five elements of a school’s relational ecology as a framework for comparing a punitive school to a restorative school: structure, leadership, staff, students, and response to behavioral incidents. Then, the author calls upon school administrators, as well as restorative justice trainers who work with schools, to utilize a systems change approach that supports whole-school change. Without a full commitment to systems change, restorative justice in education (RJE) will continue to fall short of expectations and the educational system itself will continue to cause the same harm to marginalized students as it did prior to the pandemic.","Brown, Martha A.",Laws,https://doi.org/10.3390/laws10030068,383

They are responsible for the transfer and exploitation of knowledge arising in the university context. Previous studies have been inconclusive as to the importance that the size, professionalisation or age of TTOs might have on the transfer process. However, the need to explore new markets, recognise new opportunities and identify potential customers points to the importance of TTOs having a dual exploitative and exploratory orientation and an extensive relational network. More recent research in the literature, based on ambidexterity and network theory, points to the impact that these variables could have on change management and innovation in uncertain and changing environments, such as those faced by TTOs in the current pandemic context. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyse whether Spanish TTOs, due to their ambidextrous orientation at the organisational and individual level, and their relational network with academic and market actors, are prepared to promote innovation in a COVID-19 context. Based on a cluster analysis of 29 Spanish TTOs, our results show that just a few of the Spanish TTOs surveyed would be prepared, from the perspective of ambidexterity and their relational capital, to promote innovation in a COVID-19 context. In conclusion, Spanish TTOs and their employees should focus more on ambidexterity and building extensive relational capital so that, through mentoring, training, incubation or the provision of various resources, they can help academics take advantage of the innovation opportunities offered by the changing and uncertain environment.","Rodríguez-González, Tamara Villanueva-Flores Mercedes Fernández-Alles Mariluz Díaz-Fernández Mirta",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13168688,383

However, many MR methods including the most popular inverse-variance weighted (IVW) estimator could be biased by the weak IVs that are weakly associated with the exposure. In this article, we develop a novel method called penalized inverse-variance weighted (pIVW) estimator, where we adjust the IVW estimator to account for the weak IVs by a proposed penalization method to prevent the denominator of the pIVW estimator from being close to zero. Moreover, we account for the horizontal pleiotropy|a widespread phenomenon in human genome that could bias the inference for the causal effect|by adjusting the variance estimation of the pIVW estimator. The proposed pIVW estimator can reduce to the debiased IVW (dIVW) estimator|another extension of the the IVW estimator|when the number of IVs and the IV strength increase. More generally, we prove that the pIVW estimator can achieve smaller bias and variance than the dIVW estimator under some regularity conditions. We also illustrate the improved performance of the proposed pIVW estimator over competing MR methods through a comprehensive simulation study. Further, we analyze the causal effects of the obesity-related traits and diseases on the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Notably, we find that hypertensive disease is associated with increased risk of hospitalized COVID-19, while peripheral vascular disease and higher body mass index are associated with increased risks of COVID-19 infection, hospitalized COVID-19 and critically ill COVID-19.

The data were tabulated and analyzed by univariate and bivariate analysis with a significance level of p<0.05. Results: Study subjects consisted of 55 non-severe cases and 40 severe cases. The median NLR and MLR of severe and nonsevere groups were 7.65 vs 2.92 (p<0.001) and 0.46 vs 0.25 (p=0.013). The correlation coefficients of NLR and MLR with disease severity were 0.564 (p<0.001) and 0.257 (p=0.012). The AUC of ROC analysis was 0.830 (cut-off:>4.81;p<0.001) in NLR and 0.650 (cut-off:>0.31;p=0.013) in MLR to predict the severe disease. Conclusion: NLR and MLR had a significant positive correlation with the disease severity. NLR is better than MLR in predicting severe disease in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. © 2021, Sanglah General Hospital. All rights reserved.","Suhartono, Wijaya I.; Dalimoenthe, N.

180938,Challenges of COVID-19 vaccination in the context of transplantation - A narrative review,2021,"The rectification of electro-osmotic flows is important in micro/nano fluidics applications such as micro-pumps and energy conversion devices. Here, we propose a simple electro-osmotic diode in which colloidal particles are contained between two parallel membranes with different pore densities. While the flow in the forward direction just pushes the colloidal particles toward the high-pore-density membrane, the backward flow is blocked by the particles near the low-pore-density membrane, which clog the pores. Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations show a strong nonlinear dependence on the electric field for both the electric current and electro-osmotic flow, indicating diode characteristics. A mathematical model to reproduce the electro-osmotic diode behavior is constructed, introducing an effective pore diameter as a model for pores clogged by the colloidal particles. Good agreement is obtained between the proposed model with estimated parameter values and the results of direct molecular dynamics simulations. The proposed electro-osmotic diode has potential application in downsized microfluidic pumps, e.g., the pump induced under AC electric fields.","Koyama, Shihori; Inoue, Daisuke; Okada, Akihisa; Yoshida, Hiroaki",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04116v2.pdf,383

We provide the observational strategy for follow-up of GW alerts and provide an overview of the processing and analysis of candidate optical/UV sources. For the O3 period, we also provide a statistical overview and report on serendipitous sources discovered by Swift/UVOT. Swift followed 18 gravitational-wave candidate alerts, with UVOT observing a total of 424 deg^2. We found 27 sources that changed in magnitude at the 3 sigma level compared with archival u or g-band catalogued values. Swift/UVOT also followed up a further 13 sources reported by other facilities during the O3 period. Using catalogue information, we divided these 40 sources into five initial classifications: 11 candidate active galactic nuclei (AGN)/quasars, 3 Cataclysmic Variables (CVs), 9 supernovae, 11 unidentified sources that had archival photometry and 6 uncatalogued sources for which no archival photometry was available. We have no strong evidence to identify any of these transients as counterparts to the GW events. The 17 unclassified sources are likely a mix of AGN and a class of fast-evolving transient, and one source may be a CV.","Oates, S. R.; Marshall, F. E.; Breeveld, A. A.; Kuin, N. P. M.; Brown, P.

Telemedicine is increasingly facilitating access to healthcare, in LMICs. This prospective cohort intervention study aims to investigate feasibility and acceptability of telerehabilitation to provide long-term follow-up of individuals with SCI and ABI, in Nepal, post-discharge from hospital. Methods: TERN was delivered by Spinal Injury Rehabilitation Centre, Nepal, in collaboration with University of Leeds, UK. A home visit connected participants to the Multidisciplinary Team (MDT), through a specialised video conference system. The MDT performed a comprehensive assessment before recommending personalised interventions. Outcome measures assessed functional independence in performing activities of daily living, health-related quality of life and emotional disturbances using Modified Barthel Index, EuroQoL-5D, and Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale, respectively. A subset of participants was interviewed, exploring acceptability of telerehabilitation. Findings: Between January and December 2020, 97 participants with SCI (n = 82) and ABI (n = 15) were enrolled. After receiving telerehabilitation, significant improvement to self-reported functional independence (p<.001) and quality of life were found, (p<.001). Self-reported severity of depression, anxiety and stress significantly decreased (p<.001). Qualitative interviews (n = 18) revealed participants accepted telerehabilitation, they valued regular contact with professionals without costly, difficult travel. Interpretation: This is the first study to test telerehabilitation in Nepal. This approach can be safely delivered for long-term follow-up for individuals with SCI or ABI, overcoming geographical barriers to healthcare access. A larger-scale controlled study is required to further explore clinical and cost-effectiveness.","Dhakal, R.; Baniya, M.; Solomon, R. M.; Rana, C.; Ghimire, P.; Hariharan, R.; Makeower, S.

182695,"Ensuring equity in the management of patients, over 70 years of age, on immunotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"Abstract This study is among the first to investigate whether patterns of access to basic services could explain the disproportionately severe impact of COVID-19 in slums. Using geolocated containment zones and COVID-19 case data for Mumbai, India?s most populous city, we find that cases and case fatality rates are higher in slums compared to formal residential buildings. Our results show that access to toilets for men is associated with lower COVID-19 prevalence. However, the effect is opposite in the case of toilets for women. This could be because limited hours for safely using toilets and higher waiting times increase risk of exposure, and women and children sharing toilet facilities results in crowding. Proximity to water pipelines has no effect on prevalence, likely because slumdwellers are disconnected from formal water supply networks. Indoor crowding does not seem to have an effect on case prevalence. Finally, while police capacity ? measured by number of police station outposts ? is associated with lower prevalence in non-slum areas, indicating effective enforcement of containment, this relationship does not hold in slums. The study highlights the urgency of finding viable solutions for slum improvement and upgrading to mitigate the effects of contagion for some of the most vulnerable populations.

183189,"Abstracts of “Institute for Research and Medical Consultations (IRMC) - Summer Research Program – 2020” presented at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia, on November 18, 2020",2021,"Objectives With the ongoing circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in countries across the world it is essential to identify effective ways to reduce the risk of infection while allowing society to function as close to normal as possible. Serial testing using rapid lateral flow antigen tests is a possible way to do this by screening populations in a targeted way, identifying infectious (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) people and removing them from circulation while infectious. To make rapid antigen testing effective, high levels of participation are important. This study was designed to evaluate the establishment of a testing programme in a university setting and assess some of the factors that impact participation in such a study among both staff and students. Study Design Observational, survey Methods A trial period of SARS-CoV-2 rapid testing using the Abbott Panbio rapid antigen test was set up and staff and students based in the University College Dublin Veterinary Hospital were asked to take part voluntarily for 6 weeks. Following the trial period, we used a questionnaire to evaluate satisfaction and to understand some reasons behind participation or lack thereof. Results Overall, almost all respondents to the survey stated that they were happy with having a testing programme present in the workplace and it helped to reduce anxiety associated with COVID-19. Findings indicated that staff and students did not participate equally in the voluntary testing programme. The findings also highlighted that intrinsic motivations and extrinsic motivations for participation differ. For example, participation among staff was much higher than among students, motivational messaging focused on protecting others did not resonate with students as much as staff, convenience was a key factor driving participation in both cohorts and the pressure of being forced to miss class (if positive) close to exam time provided motivation to students to avoid testing. Conclusions Introducing antigen testing into a workplace helped to reduce overall anxiety associated with the potential impact of COVID-19, but achieving good participation was challenging. Participation is key to a successful, campus wide antigen testing programme but reaching high levels of participation is not straightforward and can not be taken for granted. Different motivations drive participation in different cohorts and different messaging/incentivisation is needed to encourage participation in those different cohorts. The findings reported here should inform any SARS-CoV-2 testing programme that will run in these types of settings in the future.","Barry, G.; McCarney, C.; Farrelly, M.; Mooney, C.; Breathnach, R.; More, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.05.21261660v1?rss=1,383

While it is valuable to theorize about this possibility, it is also important to take note of the present state of work. For better or worse, it is what we are currently stuck with, and as the COVID-19 pandemic has ensured, much of that work is now taking place online. Though a 'return to normalcy' is on the horizon, part of that normalcy involves online work, which is itself a significant change in the lives of many workers. Here I develop an account of work on which work is teleologically structured. This gives the result that working is something we can fail at doing, even when we try, and we can also be unsure of whether we've succeeded or failed. The shift of certain work from in-person to online modes generates a persistent uncertainty for workers in affected professions. Because our ability to work is something we typically value, this uncertainty has significant negative consequences for a worker's self-conception. Indeed, it is analogous to disorders of agency and generates a kind of alienation.","Kramer, M. F.",Philosophy,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0031819121000176,383

To identify the viral replication site within infected shrimp cells, the viral RNA was located in correlation with virus-induced membrane rearrangement. Ultrastructural changes in the infected cells, analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), included the induction and proliferation of intracellular vesicle-like membranes, while the intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies and pyknotic nuclei indicative of TSV infection were frequently seen. TSV plus-strand RNA, localized by electron microscopic in situ hybridization (EM-ISH) using TSV-specific cDNA probes, was found to be associated with the membranous structures. Moreover, TSV particles were observed in infected cells by TEM, and following EM-ISH, they were also seen in close association with the proliferating membranes. Taken together, our results suggest that the membranous vesicle-like structures carry the TSV RNA replication complex and that they are the site of nascent viral RNA synthesis. Further investigations on cellular origins and biochemical compositions of these membranous structures will elucidate the morphogenesis and propagation strategy of TSV.","Srisuvan, Thinnarat; Pantoja, Carlos R; Redman, Rita M; Lightner, Donald V",Diseases of aquatic organisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17260828/,383

192824,COVID-19 in Pregnancy: Pregnant Women Might be at Greater Risk for Severe COVID-19.,2020,"The early release of cytokines by cells involved in innate immunity is an important host response to intracellular pathogens. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is an important cytokine produced during the early stages of an infection by macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and other cell types, and it is also a central cytokine mediator for the induction of cellular or Th1 immunity. To better understand innate and adaptive immune responses after infection with Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), we investigated serum IFN-gamma concentrations and the duration of viremia. For 2 strains of atypical PRRSV, IFN-gamma was detectable in swine serum soon after infection and lasted for approximately 3 wk. Serum concentrations of IFN-gamma peaked at about 10 d after inoculation and returned to approximately baseline levels by day 22. However, individual pigs manifested short, sporadic increases in the serum concentration of IFN-gamma from 18 to 50 d after inoculation. Prior vaccination blocked the serum IFN-gamma response associated with homologous virus challenge and altered the kinetics of the response after heterologous challenge. Two other respiratory viruses of pigs, Porcine respiratory coronavirus and Swine influenza virus, do not appear to induce serum IFN-gamma. The early production of IFN-gamma in PRRSV-infected pigs might result from activation of NK cells, a response that is more characteristic of immune pathways stimulated by intracellular bacterial and protozoan infections.","Wesley, Ronald D; Lager, Kelly M; Kehrli, Marcus E",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16850939/,383

XendoU has no homology to any known cellular RNase, although it has sequence similarity with proteins tentatively annotated as serine proteases. It has been recently shown that XendoU represents the cellular counterpart of a nidovirus replicative endoribonuclease (NendoU), which plays a critical role in viral replication and transcription. In this paper, we combined prediction and experimental data to define the amino acid residues directly involved in XendoU catalysis. Specifically, we find that XendoU residues Glu-161, Glu-167, His-162, His-178, and Lys-224 are essential for RNA cleavage, which occurs in the presence of manganese ions. Furthermore, we identified the RNA sequence required for XendoU binding and showed that the formation of XendoU-RNA complex is Mn2+-independent.","Gioia, Ubaldo; Laneve, Pietro; Dlakic, Mensur; Arceci, Massimo; Bozzoni, Irene; Caffarelli, Elisa",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15755742/,383

However, the susceptibility of the decidua to infection during the peripartum period has not been explored, even though this may affect vertical transmission. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression of ACE2 and related genes in the decidua during delivery. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing was used to characterize the transcriptomes of decidual cells before and after the onset of labor. During the peripartum period, ACE2 expression was highly heterogeneous. ACE2 was expressed principally in decidual stromal cells, uterine smooth muscle cells, and extravillous trophoblasts. Comparison of the transcriptomes of ACE2-positive and ACE2-negative cells indicated that ACE2-positive cells exhibited integrin clusters on the cell surface interactions. ACE2-positive cells were compared before and after labor onset. After delivery, the number of ACE2-positive cells was slightly higher than before delivery. Before labor onset, ACE2-positive decidual stromal cells were in the regulation of membrane protein ectodomain proteolysis cluster. After labor onset, the upregulated genes changed to include cell junction assembly genes. The susceptibility of decidual cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection is thus heterogeneous during the peripartum period.","Li, Qi; Wang, Weinan; Pei, Chenlin; Zhao, Yanhua; Liu, Rong; Zhang, Weishe; Huang, Lihui; Li, Tieping; Huang, Jingrui",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34150021/,383

METHODS Eighty-two patients with CVST were randomly divided into two groups according to the random number table method. The control group (n=41) were treated with arteriovenous thrombolysis combined with AT, and the observation group were treated with intravascular mechanical thrombectomy plus thrombolysis combined with AT. The effect of the treatment was evaluated 7 days after treatment, and a 6-month follow-up was conductedz after the course of treatment. The clinical efficacy, neurological function (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)), coagulation function, complications and prognosis were compared between the two groups. RESULTS The continuous improvement rate of clinical symptoms 7 days after treatment in the observation group (87.80%) was higher than that in the control group (58.54%) (P<0.01); The neurological function scores of both groups after treatment were lower than those before treatment (all P<0.001); The scores of NIHSS and mRS in the observation group were lower than those in the control group 7 days after treatment (all P<0.001). The coagulation indices of fibrinogen (FIB), prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 7 days after treatment in the observation group were shorter than those in the control group (all P<0.001), and the D-Dimer (D-D) level in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (P<0.001). The incidences of intracranial hemorrhage, infection, headache, quadriplegia, dizziness and drowsiness in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (all P<0.05). The recanalization rate of venous sinus in the observation group was higher than that in the control group 6 months after treatment (P<0.01). CONCLUSION Intravascular mechanical thrombectomy plus thrombolysis combined with AT for patients with CVST is effective, which can effectively improve the coagulation function and promote the recovery of neurological function, with fewer complications and a good prognosis.","Li, Xudong; Li, Tie; Fan, Yimu",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34306444/,383

This process takes place throughout the pregnancy and is crucial for the formation of syncytiotrophoblast layer. Syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 are strong candidate regulators of fusion from retroviral origin. Syncytin-A and syncytin-B are other candidates from retroviral origin in Muridae. The active role of syncytin in driving fusion of trophoblast has been identified, but its fusion mechanism is still unclear. As an intact retroviral envelope protein, syncytin-A shares similar structure profiling with other viral envelope fusion proteins, especially in the regions of N- and C-terminal heptad repeats (NHR and CHR, respectively). In this paper, we showed that SynA 1 + 2 of syncytin-A (residues 445-536, including predicted NHR, CHR, and a natural linker) could form trimer and exhibited significant alpha-helix structure and high thermo-stability. Limited proteolysis result identified a stable protease-resistant core of SynA 1 + 2, which was in good agreement with computational modeling data. NHR and CHR could interact with each other in vitro, too. Different from the previous studies, the disulfide-bonded linker was apparently vital to the stability of fusion core structure. By biological assays, NHR was shown to be inhibitive to cell-cell fusion, with IC(50) value about 5.4 microm, but CHR seemed to have no inhibitory activity even at 50 microm. From both biochemical and functional data, we first gave an explanation how syncytin-A mediated cell fusion. The insight into the mechanism of syncytin-A-mediated cell-cell fusion may provide a crucial clue to placental cytotrophoblast morphogenesis.","Peng, Xiaoxue; Pan, Ji'an; Gong, Rui; Liu, Yang; Kang, Shuli; Feng, Huixing; Qiu, Gang; Guo, Deyin; Tien, Po; Xiao, Gengfu",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17105734/,383

The aim of this study was to compare the postoperative outcomes in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma undergoing minimally invasive or open esophagectomy (OE). METHODS The medical records of 176 consecutive patients, who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) between January 2009 and August 2013 in Cancer Institute & Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, were retrospectively reviewed. In the same period, 142 patients who underwent OE, either Ivor Lewis or McKeown approach, were selected randomly as controls. The clinical variables of paired groups were compared, including age, sex, Charlson score, tumor location, duration of surgery, number of harvested lymph nodes, morbidity rate, the rate of leak, pulmonary morbidity rate, mortality rate, and hospital length of stay (LOS). RESULTS The number of harvested lymph nodes was not significantly different between MIE group and OE group (median 20 vs. 16, P = 0.740). However, patients who underwent MIE had longer operation time than the OE group (375 vs. 300 minutes, P < 0.001). Overall morbidity, pulmonary morbidity, the rate of leak, in-hospital death, and hospital LOS were not significantly different between MIE and OE groups. Morbidities including anastomotic leak and pulmonary morbidity, inhospital death, hospital LOS, and hospital expenses were not significantly different between MIE and OE groups as well. CONCLUSIONS MIE and OE appear equivalent with regard to early oncological outcomes. There is a trend that hospital LOS and hospital expenses are reduced in the MIE group than the OE group.","Mu, Juwei; Yuan, Zuyang; Zhang, Baihua; Li, Ning; Lyu, Fang; Mao, Yousheng; Xue, Qi; Gao, Shugeng; Zhao, Jun; Wang, Dali; Li, Zhishan; Gao, Yushun; Zhang, Liangze; Huang, Jinfeng; Shao, Kang; Feng, Feiyue; Zhao, Liang; Li, Jian; Cheng, Guiyu; Sun, Kelin; He, Jie",Chinese medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534234/,383

In this facility, there were no Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and resources were mobilized in order to create a negative pressure Corona Virus Unit (CVU) consisting of seven ICU beds and two step-down beds. Although the creation of the CVU decreased the non-COVID inpatient capacity to five beds, the hospital also formulated a plan to expand overall bed capacity from 12 inpatient beds to 45 beds within 24 hours. OBJECTIVE To create a ICU embedded within a CVU and implement a three day curriculum to prepare four mixed teams of critical care and non-critical care staff nurses to manage critically ill patients with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS Nursing leaders and hospital education staff developed a critical care curriculum utilizing Elsevier didactic, the DoD COVID-19 Practice Guide, and hands-on training for 34 nurses.1,2 Nurses had varied scope of practice levels from licensed practical nurses to advance practice nurses, with diverse critical care expertise to non-critical care nursing staff from the primary care medical home (PCMH), all of which participated in the cross-leveling to the CVU unit during the pandemic response. Educational elements included PPE donning and doffing, mechanical ventilation, central venous catheter maintenance, arterial catheter management, hemodynamics, and critical care pharmacotherapy. A medical model skills station with common critical care equipment such as ventilators allowed for instantaneous feedback and 13 hands-on skills training. RESULTS A fully functional ICU and CVU was created with thirty-four nurses who completed training within seven days with a didactic completing rate of 94.65 % and 100% hands-on skills. The program endures with monthly tailored re-fresher training to improve efficiency and maintain critical competencies. The team maintained operational readiness through the surge and remain resolute for the next surge. CONCLUSIONS On-going program execution and evaluation continues to develop new staff members due to permanent change of station, recent on-boarding, or because of evidence based clinical guideline changes. Training has continued, but shifted to include normal inpatient operations over the summer of 2020.

The bipolar group had a significantly shorter operation time (154.9 vs. 167.8 min, p = 0.028) and higher rate of D2 lymph node dissection (29.3 vs. 15.7 %, p = 0.012). The bipolar device group experienced significantly less pain at 12 h [visual analog scale (VAS) pain score: 3.9 vs. 4.7, p = 0.027) and 18 h (VAS pain score: 3.5 vs. 4.1, p = 0.036) postoperatively. The bipolar group had earlier abdominal drain removal (p = 0.001) and a shorter hospital stay (p = 0.024). No significant differences in laboratory value changes, morbidity, or mortality were observed between the groups. CONCLUSION Compared with the ultrasonic device, the bipolar device provided advantages in operation time, degree of postoperative pain, time of drain removal, and length of hospital stay. The bipolar device may be a useful and efficient energy device for laparoscopic gastrectomy. However, larger studies to confirm the safety of bipolar device during laparoscopic gastrectomy are warranted.","Kim, You-Na; Yoo, Young-Chul; Guner, Ali; Cho, In; Kwon, In Gyu; Kim, Youn Nam; Kim, Hyoung-Il",Surgical endoscopy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25015523/,383
202473,Genetically Predicted Serum Vitamin D and COVID-19: A Mendelian Randomization Study,2021,"Le syndrome d'inflammation multisystémique associé à la COVID-19 et présentant les caractéristiques cliniques d'une maladie de Kawasaki a été essentiellement rapporté chez l'enfant. Nous rapportons ici le cas d'une maladie de Kawasaki de l'adulte dans les suites d'une infection à COVID-19, avec un pseudo choc septique comme mode de révélation. Femme de 33 ans, assistante de direction dans un collège, admise initialement pour un rash fébrile [1]. On notait un antécédent d'infection respiratoire non sévère documenté au SARS-CoV-2 par PCR nasale cinq semaines avant. La patiente ne fumait pas. Apparition d'une fièvre en plateau à 41 °C avec adénopathies cervicales sensibles (max 1.5 cm) rapidement suivie d'un rash morbiliforme généralisé. Elle était traité en ambulatoire par l'association amoxicilline/acide clavulanique puis azithromycine, sans succès. Au 5e jour, dégradation clinique avec installation d'une insuffisance circulatoire justifiant l'introduction d'amines et d'une surveillance en réanimation. Le tableau clinique s'enrichissait d'une conjonctivite bilatérale, d'une glossite, d'un érythème palmaire, de lésions périnéales et d'une diarrhée profuse. La biologie retrouvait un syndrome inflammatoire majeur (CRP 500 mg/L, neutrophiles 37 000/mm3) avec une éosinophilie (1700/mm3) et une troponinémie à 425 ng/L. Les prélèvements infectieux étaient normaux. Le scanner thoraco-abdomino-pelvien et la fibroscopie recto-sigmoïdienne n'apportaient pas plus d'information. L'échographie cardiaque rapportait une hypokinésie diffuse modeste. La probabilité d'activation lymphohistiocytaire était faible. On notait l'absence de réponse à l'antibiothérapie à large spectre. Au 9e jour, apparition d'une desquamation des extrémités après amélioration clinique partielle (sevrage des amines). Au 13e jour, le coroscanner retrouvait une dilatation anévrismale de l'artère interventriculaire antérieure de 5,6 mm. Le traitement par immunoglobulines à 2 g/kg et l'aspirine permettaient l'amélioration clinique et une normalisation des paramètres biologiques. La maladie de Kawasaki (MK) est une vascularite systémique des vaisseaux de moyen calibre, dont la prévalence chez l'adulte se limite à une centaine de case-reports. L'insuffisance circulatoire aiguë est un mode de révélation rare de la maladie, appelé syndrome de choc de la maladie de Kawasaki. Elle est retrouvée dans 7 % des cas chez l'enfant et sa prévalence chez l'adulte n'est pas connue. Le syndrome inflammatoire avec atteinte multisystémique de l'enfant (MIS-C), initialement dénommé ""pseudo-Kawasaki"", a été décrit très tôt après le début de l'épidémie COVID-19 et apparaît en moyenne 4 semaines après l'infection par le SARS-CoV-2. C'est une pathologie rare avec une prévalence en France en 2020 chez les moins de 21 ans de 15,4 cas/million d'habitant. La moitié des patients présente une insuffisance circulatoire aiguë au diagnostic [2]. Il existe des critères diagnostiques du MIS-C selon l'OMS, mais pas chez l'adulte de plus de 21 ans. En comparaison avec la forme classique, les patients atteints de MIS-C semblent plus âgés, avec d'avantage d'atteinte cardiaque, d'insuffisance circulatoire, de signes fonctionnels digestifs, résistent plus aux immunoglobulines et justifient davantage d'une corticothérapie [3]. Les diagnostics différentiels à évoquer sont généralement le syndrome de choc toxique ou le syndrome d'activation lymphohistiocytaire. Une sidération myocardique dans un contexte hyperinflammatoire est l'une des hypothèses physiopathologiques de l'insuffisance circulatoire (dysfonction systolique et/ou diastolique sans myocardite, corrélation de l'état de choc avec l'élévation des marqueurs de l'inflammation et des marqueurs cardiaques). La plupart des patients répondent correctement à l'association immunoglobulines-corticothérapie. Dans notre cas, la patiente satisfaisait les critères de classification de l'American Heart Association pour la MK avec une évolution coronar enne caractéristique et avait un antécédent documenté à SARS-COV-2 cinq semaines auparavant. La forme adulte du syndrome d'inflammation multisystémique associée à la COVID19 est rare mais semble grave, avec l'insuffisance circulatoire comme mode d'entrée et les anévrismes coronariens comme complications, tout comme la MK classique.

203617,Translation-invariant functional clustering on COVID-19 deaths adjusted on population risk factors,2020-12-19,"The impacts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on society and economy are wide-ranging, long-lasting, and global. The experience of multiple countries or regions in fighting the pandemic indicates that there could be multiple COVID-19 surges, where a growing number of cases can be observed in the more recent surge(s). Were COVID-19 cases and clusters of cases (across surges) randomly distributed in spaces? Did population density and activity centres influence clusters of cases and associated venues? Based on information on the associated venues of the four surges of COVID-19 cases between January 2020 and February 2021 as well as population density, visuals were made to distinguish the relationships between population density, activity centres, and clusters of cases in Hong Kong. Different spatial patterns were observed across the four surges: fewer cases were observed in the first surge with a more evenly distributed pattern of clusters;the second surge as compared to the first surge saw a wider distribution and an increase in the number/layer of clusters;compared to the second surge, the third surge suffered from many more cases but saw a decrease in the general number of clusters;and compared to the previous three surges, the fourth surge had the largest number of cases, yet even fewer clusters were observed, where several clusters are again concentrated in specific areas similar to the previous surge. Across the four surges, a few locales could see recurrent clusters of cases and a few communities were without cases.","Zhou, Jiangping Ho Sam K. S.; Lei, Shuyu Pang Valarie C.

Diante deste contexto, este short paper tem como objetivo identificar e debater alguns dos principais dilemas morais que desafiam a gestão pública brasileira no enfrentamento da pandemia. Para tanto, foram selecionadas notícias de websites jornalísticos que apresentassem situações éticas que ocorreram ou ainda estão ocorrendo no Brasil. Seis áreas temáticas com dilemas foram identificadas: distanciamento social; uso de big data no gerenciamento da pandemia; atuação dos profissionais de saúde; auxílio emergencial federal e burocracia; suspensão de aulas e atividades educacionais presenciais; e liberação de presidiários como medida de prevenção. Percebeu-se que, em contextos de crise, cidadãos e gestores públicos são afastados de seu status quo, o que leva a que novas formas de raciocínio moral sejam desenvolvidas. Essas questões demandam uma contínua reflexão e debate sobre os aspectos éticos da pandemia, principalmente em relação às obrigações sociais e morais dos governos e aos limites dessa interferência no direito individual dos cidadãos em um período de crise.","Santos, Laís Silveira",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,383
203910,"Reduction in skin cancer diagnosis, and overall cancer referrals, during the COVID-19 pandemic",2020,"Background: Abnormal glucose metabolism was shown to be associated with the occurrence of remote diffusion-weighted imaging lesions (R-DWILs) after primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) onset. Insulin resistance is a metabolic disorder that was regarded as an indicator of chronic systemic inflammation. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of insulin resistance on the occurrence of R-DWILs in ICH. Methods: Patients with primary ICH within 14 days after onset were prospectively enrolled from November 2017 to October 2019. R-DWILs was defined as remote focal hyperintensity from the hematoma in DWI, with corresponding hypointensity in apparent diffusion coefficient. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used for insulin resistance estimation and calculated as fasting insulin (µU/ml) × fasting glucose (mmol/L)/22.5. Patients in our cohort were divided into four groups according to HOMA-IR index quartiles. Logistic regression analysis and smoothing plots were used to evaluate the association of HOMA-IR with R-DWIL occurrence. Sensitivity analysis was performed in non-diabetic patients, non-obese patients, hypertensive ICH patients, and patients 60 years and older separately. The association between HOMA-IR and systemic inflammatory immune indices neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) was examined with multiple linear regression analysis. Results: Among the 345 patients, 54 (15.7%) had R-DWILs. Both the third and fourth quartiles of HOMA-IR index were robustly associated with an increased risk of R-DWIL occurrence (adjusted OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.33-9.65; adjusted OR 3.91, 95%CI 1.47-10.41) when compared with the first quartile. The association was consistent in non-diabetic, non-obese, hypertensive ICH patients, as well as in patients 60 years and older. Furthermore, both NLR and MLR were independently associated with HOMA-IR. Conclusions: Our study suggested that insulin resistance evaluated with HOMA-IR index was independently associated with the presence of R-DWILs in patients with acute and subacute primary ICH. It may provide new insights into the metabolism-related brain injury after ICH ictus.","Ye, Xiang-Hua; Zhang, Jian-Li; Jin, Yu-Jia; Shen, Dan; Hao, Xiao-di; Li, Jia-Wen; Zhong, Jia-Wei; Jin, Lu-Hang; Tong, Lu-Sha; Gao, Feng",Front Immunol,,383

This paper reviews the current literature and understanding of the role that mitochondria, oxidative stress and antioxidants may play in the understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of chronic fatigue. It describes what is known about the dysfunctional pathways which can develop in mitochondria and their relationship to chronic fatigue. It also reviews what is known about oxidative stress and how this can be related to the pathophysiology of fatigue, as well as examining the potential for specific therapy directed at mitochondria for the treatment of chronic fatigue in the form of antioxidants. This review identifies areas which require urgent, further research in order to fully elucidate the clinical and therapeutic potential of these approaches.","Wood, Emily; Hall, Katherine H; Tate, Warren",,,383
205305,Impact of the influenza vaccine on COVID-19 infection rates and severity,2021,"Worldwide, knee osteoarthritis (KOA) accounts for 2.2% of total years lived with disability. There is a low correlation between joint tissue damage and pain intensity. Periarticular structures may be involved and cannot be identified in X-rays. To describe the main ultrasonography (USG) changes in symptomatic patients with primary KOA; to correlate the number of USG findings with KOA severity assessed by Kellgren and Lawrence (K&L) radiological scores, with pain intensity measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS) and with functioning scores assessed with the Timed up and go test (TUG) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) questionnaire. 100 patients with primary symptomatic KOA were assessed with X-ray and USG. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were evaluated in a systematic manner. The most frequent findings were joint effusion, pes anserinus bursitis, quadriceps tendon enthesopathy, popliteal cyst, iliotibial band tendinitis and patellar tendinitis. Pearson's correlation analysis demonstrated a significant moderate positive association between VAS scores and the number of USG findings (r = 0.36; p < 0.0001). The number of USG findings was different between K&L grades I and III (p = 0.041), I and IV (p < 0.001), and II and IV (p = 0.001, analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction). There was significant association between number of USG findings and TUG (r = 0.18; p = 0.014) and WOMAC scores for pain (r = 0.16; p < 0.029) and physical function domains (r = 0.16; p < 0.028). The most frequent USG finding was joint effusion. Periarticular structures should be explored as potential sources of pain and disability.","Abicalaf, Claudia Andreia Rabay Pimentel; Nakada, Leticia Naomi; Dos Santos, Felipe Ricardo Aquino; Akiho, Ichiro; Dos Santos, Artur Cesar Aquino; Imamura, Marta; Battistella, Linamara Rizzo",Sci Rep,,383
205431,Considerations for assessing physical function and physical activity in clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The biological motor behind the current coronavirus pandemic has placed microbiology on a global stage, and given its practitioners a role among the architects of recovery. Planning for a return to normality or the new normal is a complex, multi-agency task for which healthcare scientists may not be prepared. This paper introduces a widely used military planning framework known as the Joint Military Appreciation Process, and outlines how it can be applied to deal with the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognition of SARS-CoV-2's critical attributes, targetable vulnerabilities, and its most likely and most dangerous effects is a necessary precursor to scoping, framing and mission analysis. From this flows course of action development, analysis, concept of operations development, and an eventual decision to act on the plan. The same planning technique is applicable to the larger scale task of setting a microbiology-centric plan in the broader context of social and economic recovery.","Inglis, Timothy J J",J. medical microbiol,,383
205635,Using therapeutic plasma exchange as a rescue therapy in CoVID-19 patients: a case series,2020,"Background and objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented reliance on informal caregivers as one of the pillars of healthcare systems. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life of informal caregivers during the COVID-19 epidemic in Serbia. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among informal caregivers during the COVID-19 epidemic in Serbia. Physical and mental quality of life was measured by the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. Additional data included sociodemographic characteristics, caregiver and care recipient characteristics, and COVID-19 related concerns. The qualitative component was performed using focus groups and individual in-depth interviews. Results: Out of 112 informal caregivers enrolled, most were female (80%), and the average age was 51.1 ± 12.3 years. The majority was delivering care to one person, who was a family member, on a daily basis (86.4%, 92%, and 91.1%, respectively). In multiple regression models, significant predictors of caregivers' physical health were delivering care to a family member and a higher level of care complexity, while significant predictors of caregivers' mental health were a higher level of care complexity and increased concerns about self-health and the health of the person being cared for due to the COVID-19 epidemic. Conclusions: Informal caregivers are experiencing negative physical and mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 epidemic in Serbia.","Todorovic, Natasa; Vracevic, Milutin; Rajovic, Nina; Pavlovic, Vedrana; Madzarevic, Petar; Cumic, Jelena; Mostic, Tanja; Milic, Nikola; Rajovic, Tatjana; Sapic, Rosa; Milcanovic, Petar; Velickovic, Igor; Culafic, Slobodan; Stanisavljevic, Dejana; Milic, Natasa",Medicina (Kaunas),,383
205859,Early Experience of COVID-19 in a US Children' Hospital,2020,"Chemists have to a large extent gained their knowledge by doing experiments and thus gather data. By putting various data together and then analyze them chemists have fostered their understanding of chemistry. Since the 1960s computer methods have been developed to perform this process from data to information to knowledge. Simultaneously, methods were developed for assisting chemists in solving their fundamental questions such as the prediction of chemical, physical or biological properties, the design of organic syntheses, and the elucidation of the structure of molecules. This eventually led to a discipline of its own: chemoinformatics. Chemoinformatics has found important applications in the fields of drug discovery, analytical chemistry, organic chemistry, agrichemical research, food science, regulatory science, material science, and process control. From its inception, chemoinformatics has utilized methods from artificial intelligence, an approach that has recently gained more momentum.","Gasteiger, Johann",,,383
205860,Early Experience of COVID-19 in a US Children's Hospital,2020,"Introduction: COVID-19 is causing considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Serious respiratory complications aside, the heart is also frequently involved. The mechanisms and the extent of the myocardial injury, along with the short and long-term cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in COVID-19 survivors remain unclear. Areas covered: myocardial injury has been found in a considerable proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and is associated with a worse prognosis. The late onset of CV complications with myocarditis-like changes revealed by CMR has been reported in COVID-19 survivors. Previous observational studies on viral myocarditis provide evidence of a significant incomplete recovery with residual dysfunction and remodeling of left ventricle. Incomplete recovery is thought to be the result of persistent myocardial inflammation due to a post-viral autoimmune response. Considering the significant inflammatory nature of COVID-19, COVID-19 survivors may be at risk of developing persistent residual myocardial injury, the sequelae of which are unclear. Expert commentary: COVID-19 is an emerging threat for the heart. The extent of CV injury, along with the short and long-term sequelae, requires further investigation. The early detection of residual myocardial changes in COVID-19 survivors is of utmost importance in order to identify those patients at risk of CV complication development.","Shchedrygina, Anastasia; Nagel, Eike; Puntmann, Valentina O; Valbuena-Lopez, Silvia",Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther,,383
206379,Clinical Manifestations of Children and Adolescents with Covid-19: Report of the First 115 Cases from Sabará Hospital Infantil,2020,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is the world's most common mosquito-borne virus but remains diagnostically challenging due to its nonspecific presentation. Access to laboratory confirmation is limited and thus most reported figures are based on clinical diagnosis alone, the accuracy of which is uncertain. This systematic review assesses the diagnostic accuracy of the traditional (1997) and revised (2009) WHO clinical case definitions for dengue fever, the basis for most national guidelines. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, OpenGrey, and the annual Dengue Bulletin were searched for studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of the unmodified clinical criteria. Two reviewers (NR/SL) independently assessed eligibility, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias using a modified QUADAS-2. Additional records were found by citation network analysis. A meta-analysis was done using a bivariate mixed-effects regression model. Studies that modified criteria were analysed separately. This systematic review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020165998). We identified 11 and 12 datasets assessing the 1997 and 2009 definition, respectively, and 6 using modified criteria. Sensitivity was 93% (95% CI: 77-98) and 93% (95% CI: 86-96) for the 1997 and 2009 definitions, respectively. Specificity was 29% (95% CI: 8-65) and 31% (95% CI: 18-48) for the 1997 and 2009 definitions, respectively. Diagnostic performance suffered at the extremes of age. No modification significantly improved accuracy. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Diagnostic accuracy of clinical criteria is poor, with significant implications for surveillance and public health responses for dengue control. As the basis for most reported figures, this has relevance to policymakers planning resource allocation and researchers modelling transmission, particularly during COVID-19.","Raafat, Nader; Loganathan, Shanghavie; Mukaka, Mavuto; Blacksell, Stuart D; Maude, Richard James",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,383

207620,Extensive Testing May Reduce COVID-19 Mortality: A Lesson From Northern Italy,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Respiratory tract diseases are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in children under the age of 5 years, constituting the highest rate of hospitalization in this age group. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of hospitalizations for respiratory diseases in childhood in the last 5 years and to assess the impact of social isolation due to COVID-19 on the seasonal behavior of these diseases. METHODS: A cross-sectional clinical study was carried out, with a survey of all patients aged 0 to 17 years who were admitted with a diagnosis of respiratory diseases between January 2015 and July 2020. The database was delivered to the researchers anonymized. The variables used for analysis were date of admission, date of discharge, length of stay, age, sex and diagnosis. In order to make the analysis possible, the diagnoses were grouped into upper respiratory infection (URI), asthma / bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. RESULTS: 2236 admissions were included in the study. Children under 5 years old account for 81% of hospitalizations for respiratory disease in our population. In the adjusted model, an average reduction of 38 hospitalizations was observed in the period of social isolation (coefficient: -37.66; 95% CI (- 68.17; -7.15); p = 0.016).

METHODS: This was a case report. CASE: A 65-year-old woman taking chlorthalidone for hypertension presented to the emergency room with headache, pain, and blurry vision in both eyes and was found to be in bilateral acute angle closure. On laboratory investigation, she was severely hyponatremic and also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. B-scan ultrasound demonstrated an apparent supraciliary effusion in the right eye. Following stabilization of her intraocular pressures with medical management, she ultimately underwent cataract extraction with iridectomies and goniosynechiolysis in both eyes. CONCLUSIONS: We report a rare case of bilateral acute angle-closure glaucoma associated with hyponatremia. Chlorthalidone use and perhaps SARS-CoV-2 infection may have contributed to this electrolyte abnormality and unique clinical presentation. In addition, we discuss the challenges of managing this complex patient with active SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pandemic.","Krawitz, Brian D; Sirinek, Portia; Doobin, David; Nanda, Tavish; Ghiassi, Maryam; Horowitz, Jason D; Liebmann, Jeffrey M; De Moraes, Carlos G",J Glaucoma,,383

The article also presents the results of a study examining the relationships between COVID-19 demands (e.g., lack of personal protective equipment, concerns about infecting family members), resources (meaningful work, social support), and mental health strain within a sample of emergency medicine personnel over six consecutive weeks. COVID-related demands and hours worked were hypothesized to be positively related to mental health strain, whereas meaningful work and social support were hypothesized to be negatively related to mental health strain. Hours worked the prior week were hypothesized to exacerbate the positive relationships between COVID-19 demands and mental health strain, whereas the resources of meaningful work and social support were expected to buffer the relationships. Multilevel models controlling for mental health strain the prior week revealed that COVID-19 demands, along with hours worked, were each related to higher mental health strain during the week. Hours worked magnified the within-person relationship between personal COVID-19 demands and mental health strain. Contrary to hypotheses, social support and meaningful work were not related to mental health strain. Discussion focuses the implications of the findings for healthcare professionals.","Britt, Thomas W; Shuffler, Marissa L; Pegram, Riley L; Xoxakos, Phoebe; Rosopa, Patrick; Hirsh, Emily; Jackson, William",Applied psychology,,383

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become pandemic with 7,323,761 of infected patients and has created health emergency throughout the world. On the basis of clinical study, COVID-19 shows homology with other coronavirus pathogenesis i.e. inflammation, oxidative stress, and hyper-activation of immune system, results cytokine storm and causes acute lung infection (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and kidney dysfunction. OT is a peptide of nine amino acid, well known anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and immune-modulator molecule protective against ALI/ARDS, nephrotoxicity, sepsis, and ischemia-reperfusion medical condition. OT is a neuromodulatory, effective for stress, anxiety, social behaviour, and depression, which might be helpful for better output of COVID-19 patients. There is significant data showing OT would be useful for treatment of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Direct application of OT in COVID19 is unclear, but its use in experimental model as well as human has continuously documented its safety, and its use by COVID-19 patients predictably would be highly beneficial.","Thakur, Pratibha; Shrivastava, Renu; Shrivastava, Vinoy Kumar",Endocr. metab. immune disord. drug targets,,383

RECENT FINDINGS: Safe and efficient care of pediatric patients with COVID-19 can be delivered with the proper planning, coordination, supplies, and staff preparation. From the start of the pandemic, pediatric anesthesiologists from around the world contributed important insights and shared experience as to how best to adapt anesthesia care for children with COVID-19 requiring general anesthesia and sedation. Although initial efforts focused on creating safe airway management processes, the role of anesthesiologists as perioperative leaders quickly extended to ensuring well-coordinated management of COVID-19 patients throughout the hospital for procedures, including preprocedure testing, patient transport, operating room setup, and ensuring the safety of staff. Several important areas remain not well studied including, the timing of rescheduling elective procedures following COVID-19 infection, the perioperative implications of re-infection, and future considerations of managing vaccinated children. SUMMARY: Pediatric anesthesia care can be safely delivered to children with COVID-19 and after COVID-19 infection.

However, the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of dialysis patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the mental health of dialysis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the period preceding the pandemic. METHODS: Data originate from the ongoing multicentre observational Dutch nOcturnal and hoME dialysis Study To Improve Clinical Outcomes (DOMESTICO). Patients who filled in a health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire during the pandemic and six to three months prior were included. The mean difference in Mental Component Summary (MCS) score of the Short Form 12 (SF-12) was analysed with multilevel linear regression. A McNemar test was used to compare presence of mental health-related symptoms during and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 177 patients were included. The mean MCS score prior to COVID-19 was 48.08 ± 10.15, and 49.00 ± 10.04 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The adjusted mean MCS score was 0.93 point (95% CI - 0.57 to 2.42) higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the period prior to the pandemic. Furthermore, no difference in the presence of the following mental health-related symptoms was found during the COVID-19 pandemic: feeling anxious, feeling sad, worrying, feeling nervous, trouble falling asleep, and trouble staying asleep. CONCLUSIONS: The mental health of dialysis patients appears to be unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Dialysis patients may be better able to cope with the pandemic, since they have high resilience and are less impacted by social distancing measures.

212883,Informed Consent for Surgery at Resumption of Elective Activity After the First Wave of COVID-19,2020,"Obesity and its related metabolic disorders, as well as infectious diseases like covid-19, are important health risks nowadays. It was recently documented that long-term fasting improves metabolic health and enhanced the total antioxidant capacity. The present study investigated the influence of a 10-day fasting on markers of the redox status in 109 subjects. Reducing power, 2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt radical cation(ABTS) radical scavenging capacity, and hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity increased significantly, and indicated an increase of circulating antioxidant levels. No differences were detected in superoxide scavenging capacity, protein carbonyls, and superoxide dismutase when measured at baseline and after 10 days of fasting. These findings were concomitant to a decrease in blood glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides as well as an increase in total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio. In addition, the well-being index as well as the subjective energy levels increased, documenting a good tolerability. There was an interplay between redox and metabolic parameters since lipid peroxidation baseline levels (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARS]) affected the ability of long-term fasting to normalize lipid levels. A machine learning model showed that a combination of antioxidant parameters measured at baseline predicted the efficiency of the fasting regimen to decrease LDL levels. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that long-term fasting enhanced the endogenous production of antioxidant molecules, that act protectively against free radicals, and in parallel improved the metabolic health status. Our results suggest that the outcome of long-term fasting strategies could be depending on the baseline values of the antioxidative and metabolic status of subjects.","Grundler, Franziska; Mesnage, Robin; Goutzourelas, Nikolaos; Tekos, Fotios; Makri, Sotiria; Brack, Michel; Kouretas, Demetrios; Wilhelmi de Toledo, Françoise",Food Chem Toxicol,,383

214125,Innovation in Cancer Care Delivery in the Era of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Wuhan was the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We aimed to determine the seroprevalence and kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at population level in Wuhan to inform the development of vaccination strategies. METHODS: In this longitudinal cross-sectional study, we used a multistage, population-stratified, cluster random sampling method to systematically select 100 communities from the 13 districts of Wuhan. Households were systematically selected from each community and all family members were invited to community health-care centres to participate. Eligible individuals were those who had lived in Wuhan for at least 14 days since Dec 1, 2019. All eligible participants who consented to participate completed a standardised electronic questionnaire of demographic and clinical questions and self-reported any symptoms associated with COVID-19 or previous diagnosis of COVID-19. A venous blood sample was taken for immunological testing on April 14-15, 2020. Blood samples were tested for the presence of pan-immunoglobulins, IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and neutralising antibodies were assessed. We did two successive follow-ups between June 11 and June 13, and between Oct 9 and Dec 5, 2020, at which blood samples were taken. FINDINGS: Of 4600 households randomly selected, 3599 families (78·2%) with 9702 individuals attended the baseline visit. 9542 individuals from 3556 families had sufficient samples for analyses. 532 (5·6%) of 9542 participants were positive for pan-immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2, with a baseline adjusted seroprevalence of 6·92% (95% CI 6·41-7·43) in the population. 437 (82·1%) of 532 participants who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins were asymptomatic. 69 (13·0%) of 532 individuals were positive for IgM antibodies, 84 (15·8%) were positive for IgA antibodies, 532 (100%) were positive for IgG antibodies, and 212 (39·8%) were positive for neutralising antibodies at baseline. The proportion of individuals who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins who had neutralising antibodies in April remained stable for the two follow-up visits (162 [44·6%] of 363 in June, 2020, and 187 [41·2%] of 454 in October-December, 2020). On the basis of data from 335 individuals who attended all three follow-up visits and who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins, neutralising antibody levels did not significantly decrease over the study period (median 1/5·6 [IQR 1/2·0 to 1/14·0] at baseline vs 1/5·6 [1/4·0 to 1/11·2] at first follow-up [p=1·0] and 1/6·3 [1/2·0 to 1/12·6] at second follow-up [p=0·29]). However, neutralising antibody titres were lower in asymptomatic individuals than in confirmed cases and symptomatic individuals. Although titres of IgG decreased over time, the proportion of individuals who had IgG antibodies did not decrease substantially (from 30 [100%] of 30 at baseline to 26 [89·7%] of 29 at second follow-up among confirmed cases, 65 [100%] of 65 at baseline to 58 [92·1%] of 63 at second follow-up among symptomatic individuals, and 437 [100%] of 437 at baseline to 329 [90·9%] of 362 at second follow-up among asymptomatic individuals). INTERPRETATION: 6·92% of a cross-sectional sample of the population of Wuhan developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with 39·8% of this population seroconverting to have neutralising antibodies. Our durability data on humoral responses indicate that mass vaccination is needed to effect herd protection to prevent the resurgence of the epidemic.

215359,COVID-19 and healthcare-associated infections,2020,"To explore the association between polymorphisms in microRNAs (miRNAs) and the cholinesterase (ChE) activity in omethoate-exposed workers, we recruited 180 omethoate-exposed workers and 115 controls to measure their ChE activity using acetylcholine and dithio-bis-(nitrobenzoic acid) and genotype susceptible SNPs in their miRNA by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. ChE activity in the exposure group was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). The analysis of covariance result showed that ChE activity was lower in the (- -/- T) genotype in miR-30a rs111456995 (1.97 ± 0.47) than in the TT genotype (2.23 ± 0.59) of the exposure group (P = 0.004). Multivariate linear regression was performed to find influencing factors on ChE activity, and variables kept in the model included omethoate exposure (b = -1.094, P < 0.001), gender (b = -0.381, P < 0.001), miR-30a rs111456995 (- -/- T)(b = -0.248, P < 0.001), and drinking (b = 0.258, P =0.019). The results suggest that individuals carrying a (- -/- T) genotype in miR-30a rs111456995 were more susceptible to damage in their cholinesterase induced by omethoate exposure.","Zou, Kaili; Zhou, Xiaoshan; Wang, Wei; Shi, Liuhua; Fu, Xiaoli",Int J Environ Health Res,,383

Aim: This study aimed to assess perceived risk, anxiety and protective behaviours of the general public during the early phase of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Nigeria. Methods: An online cross-sectional study among 1197 respondents aged 18 years and above between 27 April to 16 May 2020. Result: More than half (61.9%) of the respondents had high risk perception towards COVID-19, and high anxiety level was found in 37.2%. Male gender, being a Christian, having more than 12 years of formal education and high risk perception were positively associated with observance of more than one protective measure against COVID-19. The predictors of COVID-19-related anxiety were high risk perception and being a Muslim. Conclusions: This study showed that risk perception has an influence on both anxiety and observance of protective behaviours. Being a novel experience, this research has implications to support current and future responses to a pandemic experience.","Oyetunji, Tosin Philip; Ogunmola, Olusegun Ayomikun; Oyelakin, Timothy Tomiwa; Olorunsogbon, Olorunyomi Felix; Ajayi, Foluso O",Z Gesundh Wiss,,383

215874,Living with cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic: An Italian survey on self-isolation at home,2020,"Objectives: To characterise the factors, outcomes and infections associated with antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients.Methods: Records of patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19, hospitalized at the CHU Charleroi (Belgium) between 11 March and 3 May 3 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. Factors associated with antibiotic treatment, outcomes and bacterial infections were analysed.Results: Among the 164 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median age 60.5 years [IQR] 46-79), twenty-five (15.2%) were admitted to the ICU. Twenty-six (15.9%) died in the hospital. One hundred (61%) received antibiotic treatment. Combination therapies with macrolides were more common in the early part of the study period (26/67, 38.8%). Twenty-eight patients (17.1%) had a confirmed infection, mostly of the urinary tract (18/28, 64.3%). Only 2 (1.2%) had a documented respiratory coinfection. Six of the 7 ICU infections (85.7%) were superinfections. Gram-negative bacteria were most frequently isolated. In multivariate analysis, six factors were associated with antibiotic use: being hospitalized in the ICU (OR: 4.59; 95% CI 1.07-19.71), age > 65 years (OR: 4.16; 95% CI 1.72-10.05), arrival from a nursing home (OR: 4.59; 95% CI 1.11-19.71), diabetes (OR: 4.35; 95% CI 1.26-14.93), bilateral consolidation on chest CT (OR: 9.92; 95% CI 2.40-41.06) and a C-reactive protein level > 60 mg/L (OR:2.46; 95% CI 1.13-5.37). Antibiotic treatment did not reduce the length of stay or the mortality rate.Conclusion: Antibiotics have been overused during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite a low rate of coinfections .

216139,Tuberculosis - Reaping benefits from COVID-19 in Portugal,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since its first documentation, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has emerged worldwide, with the consequent declaration of a pandemic disease (COVID-19). Severe forms of acute respiratory failure can develop. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 may affect organs other than the lung, such as the liver, with frequent onset of late cholestasis. We here report the histological findings of a COVID-19 patient, affected by a tardive complication of acute ischemic and gangrenous cholecystitis with a perforated and relaxed gallbladder needing urgent surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old Caucasian male, affected by acute respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU). Due to the severity of the disease, invasive mechanical ventilation was instituted and SARS-CoV-2 treatment (azithromycin 250 mg once-daily and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg trice-daily) started. Enoxaparin 8000 IU twice-daily was also administered subcutaneously. At day 8 of ICU admission, the clinical condition improved and patient was extubated. At day 32, patient revealed abdominal pain without signs of peritonism at examination, with increased inflammatory and cholestasis indexes at blood tests. At a first abdominal CT scan, perihepatic effusion and a relaxed gallbladder with dense content were detected. The surgeon decided to wait and see the evolution of clinical conditions. The day after, conditions further worsened and a laparotomic cholecystectomy was performed. A relaxed and perforated ischemic gangrenous gallbladder, with a local tissue inflammation and perihepatic fluid, was intraoperatively met. The gallbladder and a sample of omentum, adherent to the gallbladder, were also sent for histological examination. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides display inflammatory infiltration and endoluminal obliteration of vessels, with wall breakthrough, hemorrhagic infarction, and nerve hypertrophy of the gallbladder. The mucosa of the gallbladder appears also atrophic. Omentum vessels also appear largely thrombosed. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates an endothelial overexpression of medium-size vessels (anti-CD31), while not in micro-vessels, with a remarkable activity of macrophages (anti-CD68) and T helper lymphocytes (anti-CD4) against gallbladder vessels. All these findings define a histological diagnosis of vasculitis of the gallbladder. CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic gangrenous cholecystitis can be a tardive complication of COVID-19, and it is characterized by a dysregulated host inflammatory response and thrombosis of medium-size vessels.","Bruni, Andrea; Garofalo, Eugenio; Zuccalà, Valeria; Currò, Giuseppe; Torti, Carlo; Navarra, Giuseppe; De Sarro, Giovambattista; Navalesi, Paolo; Longhini, Federico; Ammendola, Michele",World J Emerg Surg,,383

A snapshot of the evolving role of a radiology unit facing the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"Microelectronic devices with reconfigurable three-dimensional (3D) microarchitecture that can be repetitively switched among different geometrical and/or working states have promising applications in widespread areas. Traditional approaches usually rely on stimulated deformations of active materials under external electric/magnetic fields, which could potentially introduce parasitic side effects and lower device performances. Development of a rational strategy that allows access to high-performance 3D microdevices with multiple stable geometric configurations remains challenging. We introduce a mechanically guided scheme to build geometrically reconfigurable 3D mesostructures through a bottom-up design strategy based on a class of elementary reconfigurable structures with the simplest ribbon geometries. Quantitative mechanics modeling of the structural reconfigurability allows for the development of phase diagrams and design maps. Demonstrations of ~30 reconfigurable mesostructures with diverse geometric topologies and characteristic dimensions illustrate the versatile applicability. The multimode nature enables customized distinct beamforming and discrete beam scanning using a single antenna capable of on-demand reconfiguration.","Bai, Ke; Cheng, Xu; Xue, Zhaoguo; Song, Honglie; Sang, Lei; Zhang, Fan; Liu, Fei; Luo, Xiang; Huang, Wen; Huang, Yonggang; Zhang, Yihui",Sci Adv,,383
218133,Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the transportation of patients requiring emergency care,2020,"The article considers the specifics of Russian foreign direct investment outflows in 2018 - the first half of 2020. Three main reasons for the new stagnation of Russian foreign investment expansion are identified: 1) the strengthening of ""sanctions war"" with the West after the election of Vladimir Putin for the 4th presidential term;2) the slowdown in the global economy in 2018-2019 against the background of relatively low prices for hydrocarbons and other raw materials exported from Russia;and 3) the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. These factors resulted in a reduction of both outward foreign direct investment stocks by Russian MNEs (partially due to revaluation of their assets after the collapse of the ruble rate), and a decrease in investments of wealthy Russians in foreign real estate as well as pseudo-foreign investment because of the regular attempts to conduct de-offshorization. Based on a study conducted at INION within the framework of the international program for studying MNEs from emerging markets, a list of leading Russian non-financial MNEs by the end of 2019 is presented.

Among the various functions performed by cities, tourism activities have been distinguished as the foremost in the cities of historical value. Mass tourism has developed in the last decade and its excessive flow of tourists has in turn leaded to overtourism which as described by literature is a negative phenomenon. The causes of conflicts related to the development of tourism and their scale are very diverse. The freezing of the tourism economy during the COVID-19 pandemic created an opportunity to balance its development in the future.

Therefore, we investigated the relationship between obesity prevalence of the total adult population and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates, in different countries. METHODS: A total of 54 countries from six continents were selected. Country-specific obesity prevalence data were retrieved from the latest non-communicable diseases profiles released by the Non-communicable Diseases and Mental Health Cluster of World Health Organization, while the real time statistics from the Worldometer website were used to extract data on COVID-19 infections and mortality per million of the total population as of September 30, 2020. RESULTS: Obesity prevalence data ranged from 2.0% (Vietnam) to 35.0% (Saudi Arabia). Among the selected countries, the highest number of COVID-19 cases per million was documented in Qatar (n = 44,789) while the lowest was reported from Vietnam (n = 11). Highest mortality per million population due to COVID-19 infections occurred in Peru (n = 981), in contrast with the smallest number reported in Mongolia (n = 0). A significant positive correlation (r = 0.46; p < 0.001) was observed between the total number of COVID-19 infections and the prevalence of obesity. COVID-19 mortality was also significantly correlated (r = 0.34; p < 0.05) with the prevalence of obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity prevalence in each country was significantly associated with both infection and mortality rate of COVID-19.","Jayawardena, Ranil; Jeyakumar, Dhanushya T; Misra, Anoop; Hills, Andrew P; Ranasinghe, Priyanga",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,383

Nevertheless, gambling at casinos and gambling on the Internet are both hugely popular activities. In recent years, both prospect theory and lab-controlled experiments have been used to improve our understanding of risk attitudes associated with gambling. Despite theoretical progress, collecting real-life gambling data, which is essential to validate predictions and experimental findings, remains a challenge. To address this issue, we collect publicly available betting data from a \emph{DApp} (decentralized application) on the Ethereum Blockchain, which instantly publishes the outcome of every single bet (consisting of each bet's timestamp, wager, probability of winning, userID, and profit). This online casino is a simple dice game that allows gamblers to tune their own winning probabilities. Thus the dataset is well suited for studying gambling strategies and the complex dynamic of risk attitudes involved in betting decisions. We analyze the dataset through the lens of current probability-theoretic models and discover empirical examples of gambling systems. Our results shed light on understanding the role of risk preferences in human financial behavior and decision-makings beyond gambling.","Meng, Jonathan; Fu, Feng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05653v2.pdf,383

219822,Eruption as a clinical manifestation of COVID-19: photographs of a patient,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak in the United States has disproportionately affected African-Americans, but little is known about the factors that underlie this observation. Herein, we describe these associations with mortality in a largely minority underserved population. METHODS: This single center retrospective observational study included all adult subjects with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 treated in our ICU between March 15th and May 10th, 2020. RESULTS: 128 critically-ill adult subjects were included in the study (median age 68 Interquartile range(IQR) 61-76), 45% female, and 64% African-American); 124 (97%) required intubation. Eighty (63%) died during their inpatient stay, which did not differ by race/ethnicity. Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, African-Americans had a greater proportion of women (52% vs. 30%, p=0.02), and hypertensives (91% vs. 78%, p=0.035). Asthma (p=0.026) was associated with lower inpatient death, primarily among African-Americans (p=0.02). Among African-Americans, increased age (OR [95% CI]: 1.06[1.05-1.22]per year], positive fluid balance (1.06 [1.01-1.11]per 100 mL), and treatment with Tocilizumab (25.0 [3.5-180]) were independently associated with inpatient death, while higher platelets (0.65 [0.47-0.89]per 50 x 103/ml) and treatment with intermediate dose anticoagulants (0.08 [0.02, 0.43]) were protective. Among other race/ethnic groups, higher total bilirubin (1.75 [0.94, 3.25]per 0.2 mg/dL) and higher maximal lactate (1.43 [0.96, 2.13]per mmol/L) were marginally associated with increased death, while Tocilizumab treatment was marginally protective (0.24 [0.05, 1.25]). During first 72 hours of ventilation, those who died had less increase in PaO2/FiO2 (p=0.046), and less reduction in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (p=0.01), and FiO2 requirement (p=0.002); these patterns did not differ by race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: African-American and other race/ethnicity subjects had similar mortality rates from Covid-19, but differed in factors that were associated with increased risk of death. In both groups, subjects who died were older, had a positive fluid balance and less improvement of PaO2/FiO2 ratio, PEEP, and FiO2 requirement on ventilation.","Chaudhary, Siddique; Benzaquen, Sadia; Woo, Jessica G; Rubinstein, Jack; Matta, Atul; Albano, Jeri; De Joy, Robert; Lo, Kevin Bryan; Patarroyo-Aponte, Gabriel",Respir. care,,383

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study involving all patients who presented with clinical features of SARI and who had undergone bedside chest X-ray (CXR), hemograms with TLC, NLR, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at our institute from May 1 to June 30, 2020. RESULTS: Of 204 patients, 115 tested RT-PCR-positive and 89 tested negative. The patients who presented with SARI, using CXR-based score of 4 or more, TLC of less than 8,700 cells/µL, and NLR of <7 had a statistically significant area under the curve (p<0.001) for diagnosing COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of the CXR score was 80.8% and 73.0%, of TLC was 70.1% and 74.7%, and of NLR was 70.1% and 59.0%, respectively, in diagnosing COVID-19 alone. The specificity further increased to 90.4% when we used the CXR score with NLR and to 92.8% when we used the CXR score with TLC. The post-test odds (""rule in"" disease) of a positive test for having the disease were 3, 2.77, and 1.71 times with the use of either CXR score, TLC, or NLR criteria, respectively; whereas, combined use of CXR score and NLR increased the post-test odds by 5.53 times, and combination of CXR score with TLC increased the post-test odds by 7.5 times. CONCLUSION: CXR score with TLC and NLR can predict COVID-19 infection among those who presented with features of SARI. This may help in the early isolation of the patient until the RT-PCR report becomes available.","Garg, Pawan K; Khera, Pushpinder S; Saxena, Suvinay; Sureka, Binit; Garg, M K; Nag, Vijaya Lakshmi; Purohit, Abhishek; Dutt, Naveen; Tiwari, Sarbesh; Yadav, Taruna; Singh, Surjit; Misra, Sanjeev",Turk Thorac J,,383

COVID-19 is an entirely new disease with disparate clinical manifestations that are difficult to reconcile with a single pathogenic principle. Here, we explain how the flexible paradigm of the ""damage-response framework"" (DRF) of microbial pathogenesis can organize the varied manifestations of COVID-19 into a synthesis that accounts for differences in susceptibility of vulnerable populations as well as for differing manifestations of COVID-19 disease. By focusing on mechanisms of host damage, particularly immune-mediated damage, the DRF provides a lens to understand COVID-19 pathogenesis and to consider how potential therapies could alter the outcome of this disease.","Pirofski, Liise-Anne; Casadevall, Arturo",mBio (Online),,383

However, in Brazil, a country demarcated by economic inequalities, in which approximately 25% of the population live below the poverty line, these measures will cost severe economic losses and accentuated starvation. For this reason, the underprivileged population should be immediately prioritized and well informed through good practice to avoid the virus. Since, government discrepancies in dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak leaves the population without congruent guidelines on how to react or what to believe, allowing the spread of fake news and political crises. Here, we discuss who will pay the price of the Brazilian government denying the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and suggest some measures to ensure that clear information and protection reach this population.","Ribeiro, Fabiana; Leist, Anja",Int J Equity Health,,383
221628,Letter to Editor: COVID-19- or Tramadol-induced Seizure: A Differential Diagnosis in Young People,2020,"The present study aimed to assess the repurposing potential of existing antiviral drug candidates (FDA approved and investigational) against SARS-CoV-2 target proteins that facilitates viral entry and replication into the host body. To evaluate molecular affinities between antiviral drug candidates and SARS-CoV-2 associated target proteins such as spike protein (S) and main protease (Mpro ), a molecular interaction simulation was performed using MD software and subsequently the applicability score was calculated by machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the STITCH algorithm was used to predict the pharmacology network involving multiple pathways of active drug candidate(s). Pharmacophores feature of active drug(s) molecules was also determined to predict structure activity relationship. The molecular interaction analysis showed that cordycepin has strong binding affinities with S protein (-180) and Mpro proteins (-205) which were relatively highest among other drug candidates used. Interestingly, compounds with low IC50 showed high binding energy. Furthermore, machine learning algorithm also revealed high applicability scores (0.42-0.47) of cordycepin. It is worth mentioning that the pharmacology network depicted the involvement of cordycepin in different pathways associated with bacterial and viral diseases including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, influenza A, viral myocarditis and herpes simplex infection. The embedded pharmacophore features with cordycepin also suggested strong structure-activity relationship (SAR). Cordycepin's anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity indicated 65% (E-gene) and 42% (N-gene) viral replication inhibition after 48h of treatment. Since cordycepin has both pre-clinical and clinical evidence on antiviral activity, in addition the present findings further validate and suggest repurposing potential of cordycepin against COVID-19.","Verma, Akalesh K; Aggarwal, Rohit",Chem. biol. drug des,,383

approach for COVID-19 may be needed for individuals with physical and intellectual disabilities who have limited mobility and difficulty accessing information, require close contact with direct service providers, have trouble understanding information, have difficulties with changes in routines, or have other concerns related to their disability This approach should account for the following: Social distancing and isolating within a GH may be difficult for many people with disabilities Wearing masks may be difficult for people with sensory, cognitive, or behavioral issues Masks are not recommended for children under 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the covering without assistance Residents may require assistance or visual and verbal reminders for the mouth and nose with a tissue, throwing it in the trash, and washing hands afterwards Cleaning and disinfecting may affect those with sensory or respiratory issues Hand washing or using a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol may require assistance or supervision Cleaning and disinfecting may require assistance or supervision Behavioral techniques already used in the GH can help residents adjust to changes in routines and take prevention actions These techniques include modeling and reinforcing desired behaviors, picture schedules, timers, and visual cues Organizations that support individuals with disabilities have information on and resources for behavioral techniques Behavioral therapists or local Departments of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities may be able to provide consultation for specific concerns Keep extra quantities on hand of essential food, medical, and other necessary supplies Follow guidance for Direct Service Providers (DSPs) Direct Service Providers (personal care attendants, direct support professionals, paraprofessionals, therapists, and others) provide a wide variety of home and community-based, health-related services that support individuals with disabilities Services provided may include personal care, activities of daily living, access to health services, and more

additional information needed Residents may need assistance accessing or learning how to receive medical care through telemedicine Because of COVID-19 healthcare facilities are limiting visitors’ access If GH residents need to go for testing, evaluation, or admission at a healthcare facility, a staff member, DSP, or family member should be allowed to accompany them as an essential accommodation Consider limiting the number of non-essential visitors GH may want to limit visitation (e g , maximum of one visitor per resident per day, restricting visitors with recent travel and those with symptoms of COVID-19), especially in common areas, allowing only workers, volunteers, and visitors who are essential to preserving the physical and mental health, well-being, and safety of residents Advise visitors that maintaining social distancing (at least 6 feet) and wearing a mask can help reduce coronavirus transmission When possible, administrators may want to consider screening visitors for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 This includes actively taking each person’s temperature using a no-touch thermometer and asking whether or not the person is experiencing shortness of breath or has a cough Visitors with symptoms of COVID-19 or fever should not enter the GH Manage stress and anxiety Staff and residents may experience increased stress, anxiety, depression, frustration, or concerning behaviors when routines are disrupted During this pandemic, it is critical that staff recognize what stress looks like, take steps to build resilience and cope with stress, and know where to go for help Additionally, GH administrators and staff can: Provide information to residents and staff on self-care, stress, and coping Watch for changes in sleep, eating, and mood as indications that individuals working and living in GHs may need additional assistance adapting to changes, processing emotions, or implementing wellness strategies Develop ways for residents to maintain social connections with friends and family while social distancing Maintain routines as much as possible Incorporate wellness activities to help offset restrictions of activities outside of the GH If wellness activities are group-based: Include social distancing Avoid touching the same equipment (such as balls or other recreational equipment) unless the equipment is disinfected between one user and the next Advise people to wear masks, when appropriate Prepare for Staff Shortages Train staff how toprevent the spread of COVID-19 and develop continuity plans for absenteeism Implement sick leave policies that are flexible and non-punitive Monitor staff for increased stress, anxiety, fatigue, and depression Maintain a safe level of staffing, and avoid transferring residents with disabilities to alternate settings, whenever possible, as a solution to staffing issues Individuals with disabilities have the right to receive services within the community It is important to

Our findings show that, before the outbreak, coronavirus research realized a relatively small and rather peculiar niche within the global health sciences. As a response to the pandemic, the international network for coronavirus research expanded rapidly along the hierarchical structure laid out by the global health science network. Thus, in face of the crisis, the global health science system proved to be structurally stable yet versatile in research. The observed versatility supports optimistic views on the role of science in meeting future challenges. However, the stability of the global core-periphery structure may be worrying, because it reduces learning opportunities and social capital of scientifically peripheral countries -- not only during this pandemic but also in its""normal""mode of operation.","Bianchini, Stefano; Muller, Moritz; Pelletier, Pierre; Wirtz, Kevin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00298v1.pdf,383

With worsening diffuse ST-segment elevation on electrocardiograms and reduced ejection fraction on echocardiography in the setting of systemic inflammation, fulminant myocarditis was highly suspected. Despite optimal medical treatment, the patient's condition deteriorated and was complicated by cardiac arrest that failed resuscitation. Although myocarditis was initially suspected, the autopsy revealed no evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis but did demonstrate multiple microscopic sites of myocardial ischemia together with thrombi in the left atrium and pulmonary vasculature. Additionally, scattered microscopic cardiomyocyte necrosis with pathological diagnosis of small vessel micro-thrombotic occlusions. These findings are potentially exacerbated by inflammation-induced coagulopathy, hypoxia, hypotension, and stress, that is, a multifactorial etiology. Further research and an improved understanding are needed to define the precise pathophysiology of the coagulopathic state causing widespread micro-thrombosis with subsequent myocardial and pulmonary injury.","Fath, Ayman R; Aglan, Amro; Varkoly, Kyle S; Eldaly, Abdullah S; Beladi, Roxana N; Forlemu, Arnold; Mihyawi, Nawfal; Solsi, Anup; Israr, Sharjeel; Lucas, Alexandra R",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,,383

225210,A systematic review of neuropsychological and psychiatric sequalae of COVID-19: implications for treatment,2021,"BACKGROUND: Patients with obesity are at increased risk of severe COVID-19, requiring mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. However, conflicting data are obtained for intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between obesity and in-hospital mortality of ICU patients with COVID-19. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Patients admitted to the ICU for COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were included retrospectively. The following data were collected: comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), the severity of ARDS assessed with PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratios, disease severity measured by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), management and outcomes. RESULTS: For a total of 222 patients, there were 34 patients (15.3%) with normal BMI, 92 patients (41.4%) who were overweight, 80 patients (36%) with moderate obesity (BMI:30-39.9 kg/m2), and 16 patients (7.2%) with severe obesity (BMI &#8805; 40 kg/m2). Overall in-hospital mortality was 20.3%. Patients with moderate obesity had a lower mortality rate (13.8%) than patients with normal weight, overweight or severe obesity (17.6%, 21.7%, and 50%, respectively; P = 0.011. Logistic regression showed that patients with a BMI &#8804; 29 kg/m2 (odds ratio [OR] 3.64, 95% CI 1.38-9.60) and those with a BMI > 39 kg/m2 (OR 10.04, 95% CI 2.45-41.09) had a higher risk of mortality than those with a BMI from 29 to 39 kg/m2. The number of comorbidities (&#8805;2), SAPS II score, and P/F < 100 mmHg were also independent predictors for in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU with moderate obesity had a lower risk of death than the other patients, suggesting a possible obesity paradox.","Dana, Richard; Bannay, Aurélie; Bourst, Pauline; Ziegler, Caroline; Losser, Marie-Reine; Gibot, Sébastien; Levy, Bruno; Audibert, Gérard; Ziegler, Olivier",Int. j. obes,,383

225806,It’s X-Related: Biological Bases of Increased COVID-19 Morbidity and Mortality in Men,2020,"The Q $\&$ U Bolometric Interferometer for Cosmology (QUBIC) is a novel kind of polarimeter optimized for the measurement of the B-mode polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which is one of the major challenges of observational cosmology. The signal is expected to be of the order of a few tens of nK, prone to instrumental systematic effects and polluted by various astrophysical foregrounds which can only be controlled through multichroic observations. QUBIC is designed to address these observational issues with a novel approach that combines the advantages of interferometry in terms of control of instrumental systematic effects with those of bolometric detectors in terms of wide-band, background-limited sensitivity. The QUBIC synthesized beam has a frequency-dependent shape that results in the ability to produce maps of the CMB polarization in multiple sub-bands within the two physical bands of the instrument (150 and 220 GHz). These features make QUBIC complementary to other instruments and makes it particularly well suited to characterize and remove Galactic foreground contamination. In this article, first of a series of eight, we give an overview of the QUBIC instrument design, the main results of the calibration campaign, and present the scientific program of QUBIC including not only the measurement of primordial B-modes, but also the measurement of Galactic foregrounds. We give forecasts for typical observations and measurements: with three years of integration on the sky and assuming perfect foreground removal as well as stable atmospheric conditions from our site in Argentina, our simulations show that we can achieve a statistical sensitivity to the effective tensor-to-scalar ratio (including primordial and foreground B-modes) $\sigma(r)=0.015$.","Hamilton, J.-Ch.; Mousset, L.; Battistelli, E.

In a global pandemic, development of a cheap, rapid, accurate, and easy-to-use diagnostic test is necessary if we are to mount an immediate response to this emerging threat. Here, we report the development of a specific lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA)-based biosensor for COVID-19. We used phage display technology to generate four SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP)-specific single-chain variable fragment-crystallizable fragment (scFv-Fc) fusion antibodies. The scFv-Fc antibodies bind specifically and with high affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen, but not to NPs of other coronaviruses. Using these scFv-Fc antibodies, we screened three diagnostic antibody pairs for use on a cellulose nanobead (CNB)-based LFIA platform. The detection limits of the best scFv-Fc antibody pair, 12H1 as the capture probe and 12H8 as the CNB-conjugated detection probe, were 2 ng antigen protein and 2.5 × 104 pfu cultured virus. This LFIA platform detected only SARS-CoV-2 NP, not NPs from MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, or influenza H1N1. Thus, we have successfully developed a SARS-CoV-2 NP-specific rapid diagnostic test, which is expected to be a simple and rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19.","Kim, Hye-Yeon; Lee, Jong-Hwan; Kim, Mi Jeong; Park, Sun Cheol; Choi, Minsuk; Lee, Wonbin; Ku, Keun Bon; Kim, Bum Tae; Changkyun Park, Edmond; Kim, Hong Gi; Kim, Seung Il",Biosens Bioelectron,,383

229543,"No pain, no gain? (Re)opening up research in 2021",2021,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 has emerged as a major global health threat with a great number of deaths in China. We aimed to assess the association between Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, and to compare the predictive ability of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, Age 65 (CURB65) score. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort. SETTING: Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. SUBJECTS: Confirmed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized in the ICU of Tongji hospital from January 10, 2020, to February 10, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 178 potentially eligible patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, 23 patients (12.92%) were diagnosed as suspected cases, and one patient (0.56%) suffered from cardiac arrest immediately after admission. Ultimately, 154 patients were enrolled in the analysis and 52 patients (33.77%) died. Mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (23.23 ± 6.05) was much higher in deaths compared with the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 10.87 ± 4.40 in survivors (p < 0.001). Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was independently associated with hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.13). In predicting hospital mortality, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score demonstrated better discriminative ability (area under the curve, 0.966; 95% CI, 0.942-0.990) than Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (area under the curve, 0.867; 95% CI, 0.808-0.926) and CURB65 score (area under the curve, 0.844; 95% CI, 0.784-0.905). Based on the cut-off value of 17, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score could predict the death of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with a sensitivity of 96.15% and a specificity of 86.27%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the survivor probability of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score less than 17 was notably higher than that of patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was an effective clinical tool to predict hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and CURB65 score. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 serves as an early warning indicator of death and may provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.","Zou, Xiaojing; Li, Shusheng; Fang, Minghao; Hu, Ming; Bian, Yi; Ling, Jianmin; Yu, Shanshan; Jing, Liang; Li, Donghui; Huang, Jiao",Crit. care med,,383

Comparative characteristics of the dynamics of CT semiotics and biochemical parameters of two groups of patients: with positive RT-PCR and with triple negative RT-PCR. Reflection of the results by comparing them with the data already available in the literature. The aim of the study is to compare the dynamics of CT semiotics and biochemical parameters of blood tests in two groups of patients: with positive RT-PCR and with triple negative RT-PCR. We also reflect the results by comparing them with the data already available in the literature. Materials and methods. We have performed a retrospective analysis of CT images of 66 patients: group I (n1 = 33) consists of patients who had three- time negative RT-PCR (nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA) during hospitalization, and group II (n2 = 33) includes patients with triple positive RT-PCR. An important selection criterion is the presence of three CT examinations (primary, 1st CT and two dynamic examinations – 2nd CT and 3rd CT) and at least two results of biochemistry (C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, prothrombin time, procalcitonin) performed in a single time interval of ± 5 days from 1st CT, upon admission, and ± 5 days from 3st CT. A total of 198 CT examinations of the lungs were analyzed (3 examinations per patient). Results. The average age of patients in the first group was 58 ± 14.4 years, in the second – 64.9 ± 15.7 years. The number of days from the moment of illness to the primary CT scan 6.21 ± 3.74 in group I, 7.0 (5.0–8.0) in group II, until the 2nd CT scan – 12.5 ± 4, 87 and 12.0 (10.0–15.0), before the 3rd CT scan – 22.0 (19.0–26.0) and 22.0 (16.0–26.0), respectively. In both groups, all 66 patients (100%), the primary study identified the double-sided ground-glass opacity symptom and 36 of 66 (55%) patients showed consolidation of the lung tissue. Later on, a first follow-up CT defined GGO not in all the cases: it was presented in 22 of 33 (67%) patients with negative RT-PCR (group I) and in 28 of 33 (85%) patients with the positive one (group II). The percentage of studies showing consolidation increased significantly: up to 30 of 33 (91%) patients in group I, and up to 32 of 33 (97%) patients in group II. For the first time, radiological symptoms of “involutional changes” appeared: in 17 (52%) patients of the first group and in 5 (15%) patients of the second one. On second follow-up CT, GGO and consolidations were detected less often than on previous CT: in 1 and 27 patients of group I (3% and 82%, respectively) and in 6 and 30 patients of group II (18% and 91%, respectively), although the consolidation symptom still prevailed significantly . The peak of “involutional changes” occurred on last CT: 31 (94%) and 25 (76%) patients of groups I and II, respectively.So, in the groups studied, the dynamics of changes in lung CT were almost equal. After analyzing the biochemistry parameters, we found out that CRP significantly decreased in 93% of patients (p &lt;0.001) in group I;in group II, there was a statistically significant decrease in the values of C-reactive protein in 81% of patients (p = 0.005). With an increase in CT severity of coronavirus infection by one degree, an increase in CRP by 41.8 mg/ml should be expected. In group I, a statistically significant (p = 0.001) decrease in fibrinogen was recorded in 77% of patients;and a similar dynamic of this indicator was observed in group II: fibrinogen values decreased in 66% of patients (p = 0.002). Such parameters as procalcitonin and prothrombin time did not significantly change during inpatient treatment of the patients of the studied groups (p = 0.879 and p = 0.135), which may indicate that it is inappropriate to use these parameters in assessing dynamics of patients with a similar course of the disease. When comparing the outcomes of the studied groups, there was a statistically significant higher mortality in group II – 30.3%, in group I – 21.2% (p = 0.043). Conclusion. According to our data, a course of the disease does not significant y differ in the groups of patients with positive RT-PCR and three-time negative RT-PCR. A negative RT-PCR analysis may be associated with an individual peculiarity of a patient such as a low viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract. Therefore, with repeated negative results on the RNA of the virus in the oro- and nasopharynx, one should take into account the clinic, the X-ray picture and biochemical indicators in dynamics and not be afraid to make a diagnosis of COVID-19. © 2021 ALIES.

It discusses about the latest opportunities and challenges facing higher educational institutions (HEIs) following the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Design/methodology/approach The study relied on the grounded theory's inductive reasoning to capture, analyze and synthesize the findings from academic and non-academic sources. The methodology involved a systematic review from Scopus-indexed journals, from intergovernmental and non-governmental policy documents, as well as from university ranking sites and league tables. Findings The comprehensive review suggests that HEIs can use different performance indicators and metrics to evaluate their service quality in terms of their resources, student-centered education, high-impact research and stakeholder engagement. Moreover, this paper sheds light about the impact of an unprecedented COVID-19 on higher education services. Practical implications During the first wave of COVID-19, the delivery of higher educational services migrated from traditional and blended learning approaches to fully virtual and remote course delivery. In the second wave, policy makers imposed a number of preventative measures, including social distancing and hygienic practices, among others, on HEIs. Originality/value This timely contribution has synthesized the findings on service quality and performance management in the higher education context. Furthermore, it investigated the effect of COVID-19 on higher education services. It deliberates on the challenges and responses in the short/medium term and provides a discussion on the way forward. In conclusion, it implies that HEI leaders ought to embrace online teaching models and virtual systems, as they are here to stay in a post-COVID-19 era.","Camilleri, M.

Second, to identify opportunities for research. METHOD: A literature review of the MEDLINE database, UpToDate and the Cochrane Library was conducted. Reference lists were also reviewed. RESULTS: Psychiatrists are well-positioned to contribute to positive outcomes at all stages of the disaster response. These contributions derive from their roles as doctors, mental illness specialists and clinical leaders. CONCLUSION: A novel framework for the psychiatrist's contributions was proposed. Specific knowledge of disaster psychiatry may be worthwhile, and establishment of a public disaster psychiatry centre is reasonable. Research should further examine the role of tele-psychiatry and pursue a best practice for community and front-line employee psychological preparedness.","Pridmore, William",Australas Psychiatry,,383
231793,Telehealth in Oncology During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Bringing the House Call Back Virtually,2020,"Background: Although hyperuricemia frequently associates with respiratory diseases, patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) can show marked hypouricemia. Previous studies on the association of serum uric acid with risk of adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 have produced contradictory results. The precise relationship between admission serum uric acid and adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients is unknown. Methods: Data of patients affected by laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and admitted to Leishenshan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome was composite and comprised events, such as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the association between serum concentrations of uric acid and the composite outcome, as well as each of its components. To determine the association between serum uric acid and in-hospital adverse outcomes, serum uric acid was also categorized by restricted cubic spline, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to estimate odds ratios (OR). Results: The study cohort included 1854 patients (mean age, 58 years; 52% women). The overall mean ± SD of serum levels of uric acid was 308 ± 96 µmol/L. Among them, 95 patients were admitted to ICU, 75 patients received mechanical ventilation, and 38 died. In total, 114 patients reached composite end-points (have either ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or death) during hospitalization. Compared with a reference group with estimated baseline serum uric acid of 279-422 µmol/L, serum uric acid values &#8805; 423 µmol/L were associated with an increased risk of composite outcome (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.07- 6.29) and mechanical ventilation (OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.06- 8.51). Serum uric acid &#8804; 278 µmol/L was associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.18- 3.65), ICU admission (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.17- 4.05]), and mechanical ventilation (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.06- 4.28), as assessed by multivariate analysis. Conclusions: This study shows that the association between admission serum uric acid and composite outcome of COVID-19 patients was U-shaped. In particular, we found that compared with baseline serum uric acid levels of 279-422 µmol/L, values &#8805; 423 µmol/L were associated with an increased risk of composite outcome and mechanical ventilation, whereas levels &#8804; 278 µmol/L associated with increased risk of composite outcome, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation.","Chen, Bo; Lu, Chenyang; Gu, Hong-Qiu; Li, Yang; Zhang, Guqin; Lio, Jonathan; Luo, Xiongyan; Zhang, Lingshu; Hu, Yidan; Lan, Xiaomeng; Chen, Zerong; Xie, Qibing; Pan, Huaqin",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,383
232158,Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic on Field of Cardiovascular Surgery,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges for healthcare systems and political leaders across the globe. In this case study of Brazil, we argue that leadership failings at the highest level contributed to Brazil's relatively high and escalating death rates during 2020. Drawing on an analysis of a large amount of textual documentation drawn from media reports, we emphasise the role and consequences of President Jair Bolsonaro's political discourse and prioritisation of the economy. We focus on the first wave that swept across the globe between January and late June of 2020, arguing that Bolsonaro underplayed the seriousness of the epidemic, leveraged misinformation as a political strategy, promoted pseudoscience, and undermined the Ministry of Health. He also confronted subnational governments for adopting lockdown measures - a move that enabled him to blame regional governors for the short-term economic costs of COVID-19 related restrictions. We suggest that his denialist approach to climate change paved the way for his subsequent denialism of the seriousness of COVID-19 and for his undermining of social distancing, mask-wearing and other preventative responses supported by science. These sobering findings highlight the role that national leaders can play in undermining scientific approaches to both public health and the environment.","Fonseca, Elize Massard da; Nattrass, Nicoli; Lazaro, Lira Luz Benites; Bastos, Francisco Inácio",Glob Public Health,,383

Lignans are a large class of natural compounds comprising two phenyl propane units. Many of them have demonstrated biological activities, and some of them have even been developed as therapeutic drugs. In this review, 630 lignans, including those obtained from medicinal plants and their chemical derivatives, were systematically reviewed for their antiviral activity and mechanism of action. The compounds discussed herein were published in articles between 1998 and 2020. The articles were identified using both database searches (e.g., Web of Science, Pub Med and Scifinder) using key words such as: antiviral activity, antiviral effects, lignans, HBV, HCV, HIV, HPV, HSV, JEV, SARS-CoV, RSV and influenza A virus, and directed searches of scholarly publisher's websites including ACS, Elsevier, Springer, Thieme, and Wiley. The compounds were classified on their structural characteristics as 1) arylnaphthalene lignans, 2) aryltetralin lignans, 3) dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans, 4) dibenzylbutane lignans, 5) tetrahydrofuranoid and tetrahydrofurofuranoid lignans, 6) benzofuran lignans, 7) neolignans, 8) dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans and homolignans, and 9) norlignans and other lignoids. Details on isolation and antiviral activities of the most active compounds within each class of lignan are discussed in detail, as are studies of synthetic lignans that provide structure-activity relationship information.","Xu, Xin-Ya; Wang, Dong-Ying; Li, Yi-Ping; Deyrup, Stephen T; Zhang, Hong-Jie",Phytochem Rev,,383

Considering that definition of factors that influence deceased donor kidney transplant outcomes is important for allocation policies, as well as for individualization of post-transplant care, the purpose of this study was determine the risks for death censored graft survival and for patient survival conferred by older age of the donor in the context of the age of the recipient and of risk factors for graft and/or patient survival. The investigation was conducted in a single-center cohort of 5,359 consecutive first kidney transplants with adult deceased donors performed on non-prioritized adult recipients from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2017. Death censored graft survival and patient survival were lower in older donors, whereas graft survival was higher and patient survival was lower in old recipients. The analyses of combinations of donor and recipient ages showed that death censored graft survival was lower in younger recipients in transplants from 18 to 59-year old donors, with standard or extended criteria, but no difference in graft survival was observed between younger and older recipients when the donor was &#8805; 60-year old. Patient survival was higher in younger recipients in transplants with younger or older donors. Two to six HLA-A,B,DR mismatches, when compared to 0-1 MM, conferred risk for death-censored graft survival only in transplants from younger donors to younger recipients. Pre-transplant diabetes conferred risk for patient survival only in 50-59-year old recipients, irrespectively, of the age of the donor. Time on dialysis &#8805; 10 years was a risk factor for patient survival in transplants with all donor-recipient age combinations, except in recipients with &#8805; 60 years that received a kidney from an 18-49-year old donor. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study underline the importance of analyzing the impact of the age of the donor taking into consideration different scenarios.","Gerbase-DeLima, Maria; de Marco, Renato; Monteiro, Franscisco; Tedesco-Silva, Hélio; Medina-Pestana, José O; Mine, Karina L",Front Immunol,,383

Admissions to intensive care units have suddenly increased, but many of these patients do not present with clinical manifestations related to the viral infection but rather exacerbation of preexisting diseases. In this context, we must prevent intuitive decision-making and insecurity from leading us to exhaust the available critical-care beds before they are truly necessary, while still recognizing the importance of rapid decision-making in emergency situations. One of the best ways to achieve this goal may be by practicing metacognition and establishing ways for regular feedback to be provided to professionals engaged in inherently rapid decision-making processes.","Teixeira, Cassiano; Rosa, Regis Goulart; Rodrigues Filho, Edison Moraes; De Oliveira Fernandes, Eduardo",Rev.

In the current study, we adjusted the Dutch version of the Impact of Event Scale (IES) to assess traumatic stress symptoms related to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. The psychometric properties of this Impact of Event Scale with modifications for COVID-19 (IES-COVID19) were investigated by administering the IES-COVID19 to 380 university students who participated during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, upon invitation via e-mail. Using confirmatory factor analysis, the factor structure of the IES-COVID19 was found to be similar to the original IES, indicating two latent factors: intrusion and avoidance, χ2(85) = 147.51, CFI =.92, TLI =.90, RMSEA =.044, SRMR =.049. Cronbach’s alpha showed acceptable internal consistency of the total IES-COVID19, α =.75. Pearson’s correlations of the IES-COVID19 over time were also sufficient, demonstrating adequate test–retest reliability, r =.62. Significant correlations (ranging between.15 and.50) between the IES-COVID19 and symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, stress-related rumination, as well as negative social interactions, demonstrate adequate convergent validity. Overall, the IES-COVID19 shows to be a valid and reliable measure that can be utilized to investigate trauma-related stress symptoms of intrusion and avoidance related to the short- and long-term impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Vanaken, Lauranne; Scheveneels, Sara; Belmans, Eline; Hermans, Dirk",Front.

240571,COVID-19 and COPD: a narrative review of the basic science and clinical outcomes,2020,"The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a major public health emergency worldwide with over 118.27-million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 2.62-million deaths recorded, as of March 12, 2021. Although this disease primarily targets lungs, damages in other organs, such as heart, kidney, liver, and testis, may occur. Testis is the cornerstone of male reproduction, while reproductive health is the most valuable resource for continuity of the human race. Given the unique nature of SARS-CoV-2, the mechanisms of its impact on the testes have yet to be fully explored. Notably, coronaviruses have been found to invade target cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which can be found in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, urinary tract, and reproductive organs, such as testes. Coronavirus studies have suggested that testes might be a potential target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The first etiopathogenic concept proposed by current hypotheses indicates that the virus can invade testes through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Next, the activated inflammatory response in the testes, disease-associated fever, and COVID-19 medications might be implicated in testicular alterations. Although evidence regarding the presence of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA in semen remains controversial, this emphasizes the need for researchers to pay closer attention to sexually transmitted diseases and male fertility after recovering from COVID-19. In this review the latest updates regarding COVID-19-associated testicular dysfunction are summarized and possible pathogenic mechanisms are discussed.","Abdel-Moneim, Adel",Biochemistry (Mosc),,383

241043,The invisible barrier: Providing end of life support to pediatric oncology families during COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus can cross the species barrier and infect humans with a severe respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 with potential origin of bat is still circulating in China. In this study, a prediction model is proposed to evaluate the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus for early warning. METHODS: The spike protein sequences of 2666 coronaviruses were collected from 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) Database of China National Genomics Data Center on Jan 29, 2020. A total of 507 human-origin viruses were regarded as positive samples, whereas 2159 non-human-origin viruses were regarded as negative. To capture the key information of the spike protein, three feature encoding algorithms (amino acid composition, AAC; parallel correlation-based pseudo-amino-acid composition, PC-PseAAC and G-gap dipeptide composition, GGAP) were used to train 41 random forest models. The optimal feature with the best performance was identified by the multidimensional scaling method, which was used to explore the pattern of human coronavirus. RESULTS: The 10-fold cross-validation results showed that well performance was achieved with the use of the GGAP (g = 3) feature. The predictive model achieved the maximum ACC of 98.18% coupled with the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9638. Seven clusters for human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) were found. The cluster for SARS-CoV-2 was very close to that for SARS-CoV, which suggests that both of viruses have the same human receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme II). The big gap in the distance curve suggests that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not clear and further surveillance in the field should be made continuously. The smooth distance curve for SARS-CoV suggests that its close relatives still exist in nature and public health is challenged as usual. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal feature (GGAP, g = 3) performed well in terms of predicting infection risk and could be used to explore the evolutionary dynamic in a simple, fast and large-scale manner. The study may be beneficial for the surveillance of the genome mutation of coronavirus in the field.","Qiang, Xiao-Li; Xu, Peng; Fang, Gang; Liu, Wen-Bin; Kou, Zheng",Infect Dis Poverty,,383

These inflammatory responses are mostly considered to be instigated by activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) or cytokine receptors. However, recently it has become clear that also antibodies and pentraxins, which can both activate Fc receptors (FcRs), induce very powerful inflammatory responses by macrophages that can even be an order of magnitude greater than PRRs. While the physiological function of this antibody-dependent inflammation (ADI) is to counteract infections, undesired activation or over-activation of this mechanism will lead to pathology, as observed in a variety of disorders, including viral infections such as COVID-19, chronic inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease, and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In this review we discuss how physiological ADI provides host defense by inducing pathogen-specific immunity, and how erroneous activation of this mechanism leads to pathology. Moreover, we will provide an overview of the currently known signaling and metabolic pathways that underlie ADI, and how these can be targeted to counteract pathological inflammation.","Geyer, Chiara Elisabeth; Mes, Lynn; Newling, Melissa; den Dunnen, Jeroen; Hoepel, Willianne",,,383

241676,[Cardiac Involvement in COVID-19],2021,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which could be caused by both systematic responses from multi-organ dysfunction and direct virus infection. While advanced evidence is needed regarding its clinical features and mechanisms. We aimed to describe two phenotypes of AKI as well as their risk factors and the association with mortality. METHODS: Consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, China from 1 January 2020 to 23 March 2020 were included. Patients with AKI were classified as AKI-early and AKI-late according to the sequence of organ dysfunction (kidney as the first dysfunctional organ or not). Demographic and clinical features were compared between two AKI groups. Their risk factors and the associations with in-hospital mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 4020 cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included and 285 (7.09%) of them were identified as AKI. Compared with patients with AKI-early, patients with AKI-late had significantly higher levels of systemic inflammatory markers. Both AKIs were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality, with similar fully adjusted hazard ratios of 2.46 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-4.49] for AKI-early and 3.09 (95% CI 2.17-4.40) for AKI-late. Only hypertension was independently associated with the risk of AKI-early. While age, history of chronic kidney disease and the levels of inflammatory biomarkers were associated with the risk of AKI-late. CONCLUSIONS: AKI among patients with COVID-19 has two clinical phenotypes, which could be due to different mechanisms. Considering the increased risk for mortality for both phenotypes, monitoring for AKI should be emphasized during COVID-19.","Peng, Suyuan; Wang, Huai-Yu; Sun, Xiaoyu; Li, Pengfei; Ye, Zhanghui; Li, Qing; Wang, Jinwei; Shi, Xuanyu; Liu, Liu; Yao, Ying; Zeng, Rui; He, Fan; Li, Junhua; Ge, Shuwang; Ke, Xianjun; Zhou, Zhibin; Dong, Erdan; Wang, Haibo; Xu, Gang; Zhang, Luxia; Zhao, Ming-Hui",Nephrol Dial Transplant,,383

Since the 1950s, electric eels have generally been assumed to use these three organs to generate two forms of electric organ discharge (EOD): high-voltage EOD for predation and defense and low-voltage EOD for electrolocation and communication. However, why electric eels evolved three electric organs to generate two forms of EOD and how these three organs work together to generate these two forms of EOD have not been clear until now. Here, we present the third form of independent EOD of electric eels: middle-voltage EOD. We suggest that every form of EOD is generated by one electric organ independently and reveal the typical discharge order of the three electric organs. We also discuss hybrid EODs, which are combinations of these three independent EODs. This new finding indicates that the electric eel discharge behavior and physiology and the evolutionary purpose of the three electric organs are more complex than previously assumed. The purpose of the middle-voltage EOD still requires clarification.","Xu, Jun; Cui, Xiang; Zhang, Huiyuan",Sci Rep,,383
243556,"Comment on ""Cancer Surgery During COVID-19: How we Move Forward""",2020,"The OC43 coronavirus is a human pathogen that usually causes only the common cold. One of its key enzymes, similar to other coronaviruses, is the 2'-O-RNA methyltransferase (MTase) that is essential for viral RNA stability and expression. Here, we report the crystal structure of the 2'-O-RNA MTase in a complex with the pan-methyltransferase inhibitor sinefungin solved at 2.2 Å resolution. The structure revealed an overall fold consistent with the fold observed in other coronaviral MTases. The major differences are in the conformation of the C-terminus of the nsp16 subunit and an additional helix in the N-terminus of the nsp10 subunits. The structural analysis also revealed very high conservation of the SAM binding pocket suggesting that the SAM pocket is a suitable spot for the design of antivirals effective against all human coronaviruses.ImportanceSome coronaviruses are dangerous pathogens while some cause only common colds. The reasons are not understood although the spike proteins probably play an important role. However, to understand the coronaviral biology in sufficient detail we need to compare the key enzymes from different coronaviruses. We solved the crystal structure of 2'-O-RNA methyltransferase of the OC43 coronavirus, a virus that usually causes mild colds. The structure revealed some differences in the overall fold but also revealed that the SAM binding site is conserved suggesting that development of antivirals against multiple coronaviruses is feasible.","Dostalik, Pavel; Krafcikova, Petra; Silhan, Jan; Kozic, Jan; Chalupska, Dominika; Chalupsky, Karel; Boura, Evzen",J. virol,,383

Participants (N = 868; Mage = 33.53 years, SD = 11.98) completed: the Eating Motivation Survey, the Emotional Overeating Questionnaire, a COVID-19-related stress measure and a socio-demographic survey. The final step of the regression with emotional overeating was significant; affect regulation and COVID-19-related stress were significantly related to emotional overeating (&#916;F&nbsp;p < 0.001, Adj. &#916;R2 = 0.13). During the COVID-19 pandemic, eating can, on the one hand, help to cope with the current difficult situation and the negative emotions associated with it; on the other hand, frequent use of this tendency can lead to rigid regulation of affect and use of this mechanism as the dominant mechanism. Therefore, limited social contact, related disruptions in daily activities and stress resulting from COVID-19 should generate appropriate interventions, not necessarily focusing only on emotional eating, but also on the resources of the individual. It is worth encouraging specialists to implement alternative methods of contact with their patients, e.g., online.","Modrzejewska, Adriana; Czepczor-Bernat, Kamila; Modrzejewska, Justyna; Matusik, Pawel",Nutrients,,383

In this review, according to the published literature, we provided the evidence that asymptomatic infections can result in person-to-person transmission. Four studies suggested that the virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients for at least two consecutive generations, indicating its strong infectivity. Asymptomatic infection tends to be, but is not only, identified among young people (<20 years old). The majority of asymptomatic patients appear to have a milder clinical course during hospitalization, but the severity of the symptoms of the secondary patients infected by SARS-COV-2 from asymptomatic patients varies with their physical constitution. The proportion of asymptomatic individuals among all confirmed cases widely differed (from 1.95% to 87.9%) according to the study setting and the populations studied. The increasing large-scale tests are expected to give more information about the true number of asymptomatic infections in the population. In China and other countries, various guidelines for management of asymptomatic cases have been issued. Importantly, early detection, early reporting, early isolation and early treatment of asymptomatic patients require the joint efforts of policy makers, clinicians, technicians, epidemiologists, virologists and patients.","Han, Dongsheng; Li, Rui; Han, Yanxi; Zhang, Rui; Li, Jinming",Int J Biol Sci,,383

Purpose To report on the frequency and type of neuroradiological findings in COVID-19. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, all consecutive adult hospitalized patients with PCR-positivity for SARS-CoV-2, undergoing neuroimaging at Karolinska University Hospital between March 2 and May 24, 2020, were included. All examinations were systematically re-evaluated by 12 readers. Summary descriptive statistics were calculated. Results 185 patients with COVID-19 (62±14 years, 138 men) underwent neuroimaging. In total, 222 brain CT, 47 brain MRI and 7 spinal MRI scans were performed. Intra-axial susceptibility abnormalities were the most common finding (29 of 39 [74%, 95%-CI 58-87%]) in patients with brain MRI, often with an ovoid shape suggestive of microvascular pathology, and with a predilection to corpus callosum (23 of 39, [59%, 95%-CI 42-74%]) and juxtacortical areas (14 of 39, [36%, 95% CI 21-53%]). Ischemic and macrohemorrhagic manifestations were also seen, but vascular imaging did not reveal overt abnormalities. Dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI in 19 patients did not reveal consistent asymmetries between hemispheres or regions. Many patients (18 of 41 [44%, 95%-CI 28-60%]) had leukoencephalopathy and one patient had a cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum. Other findings included olfactory bulb signal abnormalities (7 of 37, 19%), prominent optic nerve subarachnoid spaces (20 of 36, 56%), and enhancement of the parenchyma (3 of 20, 15%), leptomeninges (3 of 20, 15%), cranial nerves (2 of 20, 10%), and spinal nerves (2 of 4, 50%). At MRI follow-up, regression of leukoencephalopathy and progressive leptomeningeal enhancement was observed in one patient respectively, suggestive of dynamic processes.

This case study research included the result of questionnaire from thirty IC students followed by interview with three EFL teachers in the Intensive English Course (IC) program and six IC program students in one of Islamic University in Kediri. The small survey indicated that students have positive attitude toward the administration of online assessment. Furthermore, the outcomes of open-ended interviews showed that there were four themes for beneficial effects, including enhancing flexibility in assessment, improving evaluation versatility, building teachers and students’ awareness of preparing evaluation and cultivating students’ autonomous learning abilities. On the other hand, three themes for negative effects emerged from the online assessment, including complication of evaluation administration, reduced interaction between teachers and students, and anxiety in English test. The effects emerge from how teachers and students view the drawbacks of the online assessment itself. Positive effects lead to students’ learning better are caused by lesson taken from conducting the test;however, the negatives should be treated as challenges that will improve the teaching and learning. Finally, both teachers and students are ready to face online assessment in the future.","Fitriyah, Ima; Jannah, Miftahul; en,",Ijeltal (Indonesian Journal Of English Language Teaching And Applied Linguistics),,383

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In an observational cohort study, 116 men aged 4565 years were followed. Of these, 57 patients with AF, AH and AO and a control group including 59 patients with AF, AH and without AO. Testing of polymorphism rs1378942 of the CSK gene and rs2200733 of chromosome 4q25 using polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism. All statistical calculations were performed using the Rstudio program (version 0.99.879 20092016 RStudio, Inc., USA). RESULTS: The average age of all studied patients was 53.37.1 years. When dividing patients with AF and AH into groups based on the presence/absence of AO, it turned out that in the subgroups of carriers of different genotypes of the rs1378942 polymorphism of the CSK gene there are significant differences in BMI: in the group with BMI, there is an increase in the indicator in the series of CC, AC, AA genotypes. The highest BMI value in carriers of the CC genotype (p0.03) was in the group with AO. In the subgroups of carriers of different rs2200733 genotypes of chromosome 4q25, CC has the highest BMI (p0.05). It was proved that in the group with AO, the progression of AF occurred 2.57 times more often than in the group without AO (p0.003). CONCLUSION: In men with AF and AH, single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1378942 of the CSK gene and rs2200733 of chromosome 4q25 are associated with BMI. The heterozygous genotype AC rs1378942 in the CSK gene is significantly more common in patients, regardless of the presence of AO. In the group with AO, the progression of AF occurred 2.57 times more often than in the group without AO.","Hidirova, L D; Yakhontov, D A; Maksimov, V N",Ter Arkh,,383

These networks can contain a variety of information types and represent different aspects of a system. However, the process for selecting which information to include is not always straightforward. Using data on two agonistic behaviors in a captive population of monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus), we developed a framework for investigating how pooling or splitting behaviors at the scale of dyadic relationships (between two individuals) affects group-level social properties. We designed two reference models to test whether randomizing the number of interactions across behavior types results in similar structural patterns as the observed data. Although the behaviors were correlated, the sociality measures derived from observed data fell outside the distribution of those derived from the reference model. However, once we controlled for data sparsity in our second reference model, we found that measures from the observed data then fell within the range of those from the reference model which showed that this result may have been due to the unequal frequencies of each observed behavior. Thus, our findings support pooling the two behaviors. This framework can be used for any type of behavior and question, however, caution should be used when interpreting the results as some measures are sensitive to data properties, such as unequal rates of observed behavior in our case. This framework will help researchers make informed and data-driven decisions about which behaviors to pool or separate, prior to using the data in subsequent multilayer network analyses.","Marel, Annemarie van der; Prasher, Sanjay; Carminito, Chelsea; O'Connell, Claire; Phillips, Alexa; Kluever, Bryan M.; Sciences, Elizabeth A.

CL utilizes light excited due to the interactions between the electron-beam and the sample. In the present study we focus on CËerenkov radiation. We make use of the fact that the electron transparent specimen acts as a Fabry-Pérot interferometer for coherently emitted radiation. From the wavelength dependent interference pattern of thickness dependent measurements we calculate the refractive index of the studied material. We describe the limits of this approach and compare it with the determination of the refractive index by using valence electron energy loss spectrometry (VEELS).,"Stöger-Pollach, Michael; Löffler, Stefan; Maurer, Niklas; Bukvisová, Kristýna",Ultramicroscopy,,383

248317,Multiple Microbleeds: A Serious Neurological Manifestation in a Critically Ill COVID-19 Patient,2020,"Visual inspection of world maps shows that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is less prevalent in countries closer to the equator, where heat and humidity tend to be higher. Scientists disagree how to interpret this observation because the relationship between COVID-19 and climatic conditions may be confounded by many factors. We regress the logarithm of confirmed COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants in a country against the country's distance from the equator, controlling for key confounding factors: air travel, vehicle concentration, urbanization, COVID-19 testing intensity, cell phone usage, income, old-age dependency ratio, and health expenditure. A one-degree increase in absolute latitude is associated with a 4.3% increase in cases per million inhabitants as of January 9, 2021 (p value < 0.001). Our results imply that a country, which is located 1000 km closer to the equator, could expect 33% fewer cases per million inhabitants. Since the change in Earth's angle towards the sun between equinox and solstice is about 23.5°, one could expect a difference in cases per million inhabitants of 64% between two hypothetical countries whose climates differ to a similar extent as two adjacent seasons. According to our results, countries are expected to see a decline in new COVID-19 cases during summer and a resurgence during winter. However, our results do not imply that the disease will vanish during summer or will not affect countries close to the equator. Rather, the higher temperatures and more intense UV radiation in summer are likely to support public health measures to contain SARS-CoV-2.","Chen, Simiao; Prettner, Klaus; Kuhn, Michael; Geldsetzer, Pascal; Wang, Chen; Bärnighausen, Till; Bloom, David E",Sci Rep,,383

248573,"In Response to Voice, Swallow and Airway Outcomes Following Tracheostomy for COVID-19",2021,"Little research exists concerning the Western marriage proposal ritual, and rejected proposals are particularly understudied. The current research used the lens of life script theory to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze 374 first-person written accounts of accepted and rejected marriage proposals between men and women that were sampled from online forums. Rejected proposals were more likely than accepted proposals to violate the proposal script. Compared to accepted proposals, rejected proposals included fewer ritual elements and they often happened ""off-time."" Specifically, rejected proposals came earlier in the relationship, typically prior to the discussion of the topic of marriage by the couple, and rejected men sometimes proposed to ""save"" an unstable or abusive relationship that was headed toward dissolution. As with other important life transition events, audiences played an important role in many proposals. Rejected proposals were more likely to occur in public than accepted proposals, and when present, audience members often participated in the proposal by encouraging couples to follow the proposal script and by expressing dissatisfaction when the script was violated. Some audiences became hostile when the woman said ""no."" Also consistent with life script theory, couples evinced strong emotions during proposals, and confusion and anger were common emotional responses among rejected suitors. Indeed, 15% of rejected proposal accounts described intimate partner violence. Yet, about 30% of relationships continued after the rejection, sometimes for years. These and other novel results contribute to the science of close relationships, family psychology, life script theory, commitment, rejection, and social rituals.

248579,Safety Assessment of a Noninvasive Respiratory Protocol for Adults With COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, health care systems worldwide are working under challenging conditions. Patients, who are seriously ill, require intensive care admission. In fighting COVID-19, nurses are frontline health care workers and, as such, have a great responsibility providing needed specialized patient care in intensive care units (ICU). However, working conditions and emotional factors have an impact on the quality of the care provided. AIM: The purpose of the present study was to explore and describe the experiences and perceptions of nurses working in an ICU during the COVID-19 global pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative research was undertaken, using an empirical approach and inductive content analysis techniques. METHODS: The selected population consisted of ICU nurses from a tertiary teaching hospital in Spain. Data were obtained via semi-structured videocall interviews from Apr 12th to Apr 30th, 2020. Subsequently, transcribed verbatims were analysed using the template analysis model of Brooks. FINDINGS: A total of 17 nurses comprised the final sample after data saturation. Four main themes emerged from the analysis and 13 subthemes: ""providing nursing care,"" ""psychosocial aspects and emotional lability,"" ""resources management and safety"" and ""professional relationships and fellowship."" CONCLUSION: Providing health care by intensive care nursing professionals, during the COVID-19 pandemic, has shown both strong and weak points in the health care system. Nursing care has been influenced by fear and isolation, making it hard to maintain the humanization of the health care. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Implications for practice include optimizing resource management (human and material), providing psychological support, and adequate training for ICU nurses, as well as high-quality protocols for future emergency situations.","Fernández-Castillo, Rafael-Jesús; González-Caro, María-Dolores; Fernández-García, Elena; Porcel-Gálvez, Ana-María; Garnacho-Montero, José",Nurs. crit. care,,383

248742,COVID-19: A Time Like No Other in (the Department of) Neurological Surgery,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Sarcopenia is generally used to describe the age-related loss of muscle mass and strength believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of physical frailty and functional impairment that may occur with old age. The knowledge surrounding the prevalence and determinants of sarcopenia in older medical patients is scarce, and it is unknown whether specific biomarkers can predict physical deconditioning during hospitalisation. We hypothesise that a combination of clinical, functional and circulating biomarkers can serve as a risk stratification tool and can (i) identify older acutely ill medical patients at risk of prolonged hospital stays and (ii) predict changes in muscle mass, muscle strength and function during hospitalisation. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: The Copenhagen PROTECT study is a prospective cohort study consisting of acutely ill older medical patients admitted to the acute medical ward at Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg, Denmark. Assessments are performed within 24 hours of admission and include blood samples, body composition, muscle strength, physical function and questionnaires. A subgroup of patients transferred to the Geriatric Department are included in a smaller geriatric cohort and have additional assessments at discharge to evaluate the relative change in circulating biomarker concentrations, body composition, muscle strength and physical function during hospitalisation. Enrolment commenced 4 November 2019, and proceeds until August 2021. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been approved by the local ethics committee of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg (H-19039214) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (P-2019-239) and all experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

249067,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a stroke center in Latin America,2020,"AIM: Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are a known factor that accelerates vascular complications. AGEs (e.g. pentosidine or N-Îµ-carboxy-methyl-lysine [CML]) have been particularly investigated in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease and have been associated not only with arteriosclerosis, but also with novel vascular events. On the contrary, the correlation of vascular events with AGEs has not been sufficiently investigated in groups excluding those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of AGEs on the history of vascular events in postmenopausal women excluding those with diabetes or renal insufficiency. METHODS: Japanese postmenopausal women were registered to the study after obtaining informed consent. Patients with critical illness, including diabetes mellitus and renal insufficiency, were excluded from the study. Participants were asked about their medical histories during the registration for the Nagano Cohort Study. Non-fasting serum and urine samples were collected to measure biochemical markers, including urinary pentosidine and serum CML levels. RESULTS: Among 357 postmenopausal women, 32 had a history of vascular events. After adjusting age and other variables known to be associated with the presence of vascular event history, positive correlations between AGEs and vascular event history were observed (standardized odds ratio of log[pentosidine] 1.38, 95% CI 0.96-2.00, P = 0.086; standardized odds ratio of log[CML] 1.73, 95% CI 1.10-2.74, P = 0.019). DISCUSSION: The present results showed a significant association between serum CML and the presence of vascular event history, suggesting that serum CML might play a role in vascular events.

The authors developed a miniaturized, label-free electrochemical impedimetric immunosensor for the sensitive and direct detection of arthritis Anti-CCP-ab biomarker. An interdigitated-chain-shaped microelectrode array (ICE) was fabricated by taking the advantage of microelectromechanical systems. The fabricated ICE was modified with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of Mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA) for immobilization of the synthetic peptide bio-receptor (B-CCP). The B-CCP was attached onto the surface of SAM modified ICE through a strong avidin-biotin bio-recognition system. The modified ICE surface with the SAM and bio-molecules (Avidin, B-CCP, Anti-CCP-ab and BSA) was morphologically and electrochemically characterized. The change in the sensor signal upon analyte binding on the electrode surface was probed through the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) property of charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of the modified electrodes. EIS measurements were target specific and the sensor response was linearly increased with step wise increase in target analyte (Anti-CCP-ab) concentrations. The developed sensor showed a linear range for the addition of Anti-CCP-ab between 1 IU mL-1 â 800 IU mL-1 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and Human serum (HS), respectively. The sensor showed a limit of detection of 0.60 IU mL-1 and 0.82 IU mL-1 in the PBS and HS, respectively. The develop bio-electrode showed a good reproducibility (relative standard deviation (RSD), 1.52%), selectivity and stability (1.5% lost at the end of 20th day) with an acceptable recovery rate (98.0% â 101.18%) and % RSD's for the detection of Anti-CCP-ab in spiked HS samples.","Chinnadayyala, Somasekhar R; Cho, Sungbo",Sensors (Basel),,383

Of the 9 locations, 3 had one or more employees infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the two week study period. None of the employees who tested positive had symptoms at the time of testing and none developed symptoms during subsequent 14 day quarantine. Locations with significant prevalence of Coronavirus contaminated environmental surfaces were 10 times more likely to have a positive employees than locations with no or very few environmental surfaces positive for Coronavirus. Break room chairs, workbenches, and break room door handles were the most frequently contaminated environmental surfaces. Surface Coronavirus RNA was detected at very low concentrations (RT-PCR 34 to 38 Cq).

METHODS: We attempted viral isolation in 82 nasopharyngeal swabs from 72 patients with confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection. Study population was divided into four groups: (i) Patients during the first week of symptoms; (ii) Patients with prolonged positive PCR; (iii) Healthcare workers from a hospital participating of an outbreak investigation, with SARS-COV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and (iv) Recipients of convalescent immune plasma (CIP).Vero Cl76 cell-line (ATCC CRL-587) was used in assays for virus isolation. Plasma samples of CIP recipients were also tested with plaque-reduction neutralization test. RESULTS: We obtained infectious SARS-COV-2 isolates from 15/84 nasopharyngeal swabs. The virus could not be isolated from upper respiratory tract samples collected 10-day after onset of symptoms (AOS) in patients with mild-moderate disease. CONCLUSION: The knowledge of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity AOS is relevant for effective prevention measures.

254304,Does Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor predict the prognosis of COVID-19 disease?,2021,"Diabetes and other medically compromising diseases may affect people in many ways. Missing teeth can be replaced by various methods including dental implants. The stability, a more natural appearance, and minimizing the risk of bone resorption attribute to its direct anchor into bones. Nevertheless, diabetic patients may experience failure of implant placement due to microvascular complications that lead to sluggish healing after surgery. In addition, some medications are believed to impair bone healing, thus compromising dental implant success. This paper evaluates osseointegration and crestal bone loss of implants placed in medically compromised patients. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using patient records from Department of Prosthodontics, Saveetha Dental College, Chennai, from June 2019 to March 2020. Patients who had dental implants and were medically compromised were chosen randomly. Data were collected and then subjected to statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics analysis was done to find the correlation between crestal bone loss and medically compromised individuals. Microsoft Excel 2016 data spreadsheets were used to collect data, which were later exported to SPSS. Among 89 patients, more than 60% experienced crestal bone loss following implant placement. Diabetic patients recorded the highest prevalence of bone loss in comparison to other medically compromised patients. A significant association was found between crestal bone loss and diabetic patients (p < 0.05) Patients whose diseases were under control with medication were also observed to have bone loss. Overall, the prevalence of crestal bone loss seems to be higher in diabetic patients compared to other medically compromised patients. There seems to be definite correlation between diabetes and crestal bone loss.","Soh, Nurul Husniyah Binti Che; Duraisamy, Revathi; B, Arthi",J Long Term Eff Med Implants,,383

258608,The effect of COVID-19 disease on general anaesthesia rates for caesarean section,2020,"BackgroundEstimating real-world vaccine effectiveness is vital to assess the impact of the vaccination programme on the pandemic and inform the ongoing policy response. However, estimating vaccine effectiveness using observational data is inherently challenging because of the non-randomised design and the potential for unmeasured confounding. MethodsWe used a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to estimate vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 mortality in England, exploiting the discontinuity in vaccination rates resulting from the UKs age-based vaccination priority groups. We used the fact that people aged 80 or over were prioritised for the vaccine roll-out in the UK to compare the risk of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 death in people aged 75-79 and 80-84. FindingsThe prioritisation of vaccination of people aged 80 or above led to a large discrepancy in vaccination rates in people 80-84 compared to those 75-79 at the beginning of the vaccination campaign. We found a corresponding difference in COVID-19 mortality, but not in non-COVID-19 mortality, suggesting that our approach appropriately addresses the issue of unmeasured confounding factors. Our results suggest that the first vaccine dose reduced the risk of COVID-19 death by 70.5% (95% CI 18.2-117.7) in those aged 80. InterpretationsOur results support existing evidence that a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine has a strong protective effect against COVID-19 mortality in older adults. The RDD estimate of vaccine effectiveness is comparable to previously published studies using different methods, suggesting that unmeasured confounding factors are unlikely to substantially bias these studies. FundingOffice for National Statistics. Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for studies reporting on the real-world effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccination on risk of death using terms such as ""COVID-19"", ""vaccine effectiveness"", ""mortality"" and ""death"". The relevant published studies on this topic report vaccine effectiveness estimates against risk of death ranging from 64.2% to 98.7%, for varying times post-vaccination. All of these are observational studies and therefore potentially subject to bias from unmeasured confounding. We found no studies that used a quasi-experimental method such as regression discontinuity design, which is not subject to bias from unmeasured confounding, to calculate the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccination on risk of COVID-19 death, or on other outcomes such as hospitalisation or infection. Added value of this studyThe estimates of vaccine effectiveness based on observational data may be biased by unmeasured confounding. This study uses a regression discontinuity design to estimate vaccine effectiveness, exploiting the fact that the vaccination campaign in the UK was rolled out following age-based priority groups. This enables the calculation of an unbiased estimate of the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine against risk of death. The vaccine effectiveness estimate of 70.5% (95% CI 18.2-117.7) is similar to previously published estimates, therefore suggesting that these estimates are not substantially affected by unmeasured confounding factors and confirming the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine against risk of COVID-19 death. Implications of all the available evidenceObtaining an unbiased estimate of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness is of vital importance in informing policy for lifting COVID-19 related measures. The regression discontinuity design provides confidence that the existing estimates from observational studies are unlikely to be substantially biased by unmeasured confounding.","Bermingham, Charlotte; Morgan, Jasper; Ayoubkhani, Daniel; Glickman, Myer; Islam, Nazrul; Sheikh, Aziz; Sterne, Jonathan; Walker, A.

260658,What is COVID-19?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disproportionately impacted nursing homes (NHs) with large shares of Black residents. We examined the associations between the proportion of Black residents in NHs and COVID-19 infections and deaths, accounting for structural bias (operationalized as county-level factors) and stratifying by urbanicity/rurality. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional observational cohort study using publicly available data from the LTCfocus, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Long-Term Care Facility COVID-19 Module, and the NYTimes county-level COVID-19 database. Four multivariable linear regression models omitting and including facility characteristics, COVID-19 burden, and county-level fixed effects were estimated. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In total, 11,587 US NHs that reported data on COVID-19 to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and had data in LTCfocus and NYTimes from January 20, 2020 through July 19, 2020. MEASURES: Proportion of Black residents in NHs (exposure); COVID-19 infections and deaths (main outcomes). RESULTS: The proportion of Black residents in NHs were as follows: none= 3639 (31.4%), <20% = 1020 (8.8%), 20%-49.9% = 1586 (13.7%), &#8805;50% = 681 (5.9%), not reported = 4661 (40.2%). NHs with any Black residents showed significantly more COVID-19 infections and deaths than NHs with no Black residents. There were 13.6 percentage points more infections and 3.5 percentage points more deaths in NHs with &#8805;50% Black residents than in NHs with no Black residents (P < .001). Although facility characteristics explained some of the differences found in multivariable analyses, county-level factors and rurality explained more of the differences. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: It is likely that attributes of place, such as resources, services, and providers, important to equitable care and health outcomes are not readily available to counties where NHs have greater proportions of Black residents. Structural bias may underlie these inequities. It is imperative that support be provided to NHs that serve greater proportions of Black residents while considering the rurality of the NH setting.","Travers, Jasmine L; Agarwal, Mansi; Estrada, Leah V; Dick, Andrew W; Gracner, Tadeja; Wu, Bei; Stone, Patricia W",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,383
260863,Assessing Operating Room Preparedness for COVID-19 Patients through In-Situ Simulations,2020,"[...]lack of adequate protection and perceived organizational support may have a negative effect on employee well-being and even lead to posttraumatic stress symptoms. Because a pandemic poses an extreme threat to employee perceptions of organizational physical and psychological safety, using theory-based approaches to understand how organizations can reduce employee stress associated with changes spurred by COVID-19 is critical. Recently, almost every individual in the world has experienced a major change in their status quo (e.g., travel restrictions, retail shutdown, a demographically undiscerning and internationally connected health threat), which is frequently associated with increases in fear and distress and decreases in physical and psychological well-being. Because it is common for frontline workers to experience negative emotions linked to coping with stressors associated with COVID-19 (e.g., high workload, potentially hazardous working environment, unclear infection control policies, coworker negative emotions), applying leadership principles and supervisor behaviors inspired by signaling theory may help increase positive emotions among employees, which can be an extremely useful tool to inspire hope and to maintain employee trust in the organization (Kim & Niederdeppe, 2013). [...]simple signals that are followed through by organizational action and supervisor behaviors can increase the availability of job resources and decrease the amount of demands, resulting in a positive additive effect on health, safety, and well-being when larger scale changes such as training and survey analysis are not practical. * Corresponding author.","Green, Sydney Howard Gino Perkins Hannah Traylor Horatio",Industrial and Organizational Psychology,,383

The application of deep learning for image classification of chest X-ray images of Covid-19 patients, could become a novel pre-diagnostic detection methodology. However, deep learning architectures require large labelled datasets. This is often a limitation when the subject of research is relatively new as in the case of the virus outbreak, where dealing with small labelled datasets is a challenge. Moreover, in the context of a new highly infectious disease, the datasets are also highly imbalanced,with few observations from positive cases of the new disease. In this work we evaluate the performance of the semi-supervised deep learning architecture known as MixMatch using a very limited number of labelled observations and highly imbalanced labelled dataset. We propose a simple approach for correcting data imbalance, re-weight each observationin the loss function, giving a higher weight to the observationscorresponding to the under-represented class. For unlabelled observations, we propose the usage of the pseudo and augmentedlabels calculated by MixMatch to choose the appropriate weight. The MixMatch method combined with the proposed pseudo-label based balance correction improved classification accuracy by up to 10%, with respect to the non balanced MixMatch algorithm, with statistical significance. We tested our proposed approach with several available datasets using 10, 15 and 20 labelledobservations.

264276,COVID-19 outbreak: Key considerations for safety of health care workers,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has stretched hospitals to capacity with highly contagious patients. Acute care hospitals around the world have needed to develop ways to conserve dwindling supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) while front-line clinicians struggle to reduce risk of exposure. By placing intravenous smart pumps (IVSP) outside patient rooms, nurses can more quickly attend to alarms, rate adjustments and bag changes with reduced personal risk and without the delay of donning necessary PPE to enter the room. The lengthy tubing required to place IVSP outside of patient rooms comes with important clinical implications which increase the risk to patient safety for the already error-prone intravenous medication administration process. This article focuses on the implications of increasing medication dead volume as intravenous tubing lengths increase. The use of extended intravenous tubing will lead to higher medication volumes held in the tubing which comes with significant safety implications related to unintended alterations in drug delivery. Safe intravenous medication administration is a collaborative responsibility across the team of nurses, pharmacists and ordering providers. This article discusses the importance and safety implications for each role when dead volume is increased due to IVSP placement outside of patient rooms during the COVID-19 pandemic. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

This article provides a biopsychosocial perspective on the COVID pandemic and an editorial comment on the articles in this Special Issue of Psychosomatic Medicine. Based on analysis of the PubMed database, it is shown that the attention to psychological and social factors is 74% higher in COVID-19-related articles compared to all other health-related scientific articles published during the same time-period (between 1/1/2020 and 4/18/2021). Specifically, 18.6% of the &#8776;123,500 articles addressing COVID-19-related topics also included psychological or social factors in their content vs. 10.7% of articles that did not address COVID-19. The biopsychosocial model is relevant to understanding the interrelationships among risk factors and the multidimensional clinical and psychosocial COVID-19 outcomes. Clinical outcomes directly related to COVID-19 range from severe but rare events (mortality and intensive care treatment) to less severe common outcomes such as positive screening tests for COVID-19 with or without symptoms. In addition, psychosocial outcomes range in severity from frequently observed reduced psychological wellbeing to less common clinical mood and anxiety disorders and, in rare cases, suicidality. The COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by an unusually strong and short-term link between social factors and biological aspects of the disease, without mediating psychological factors. After a review of the articles presented in this Special Issue, this editorial concludes with suggestions for biopsychosocial models in research on COVID-19 and other large-scale health threats.","Kop, Willem J",Psychosom Med,,383

It is unfair because those who are younger and poorer end up subsidising those who are older and richer. It is inefficient because those paying discounted prices or taxes have an incentive to demand more than they would if they paid the full price.

Since it has been shown that the virus can be detected in sewage even before the onset of symptoms in the local population, Wastewater Based Epidemiology should be developed not only to localize infection clusters of the primary wave but also to detect a potential second, or subsequent, wave. To prevent a panzootic, virus removal techniques from wastewater need to be implemented to prevent the virus dissemination into the environment. In that context, this review presents recent improvements in all the fields of wastewater treatment from treatment ponds to the use of algae or nanomaterials with a particular emphasis on membrane-based techniques.","Lesimple, Alain; Jasim, Saad Y.; Johnson, Daniel J.; Hilal, Nidal",J.

Approach and Results: Consecutive adults admitted to a large New York City hospital system with a positive polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) between March 1, 2020 and April 8, 2020 were identified. Elevated D-dimer was defined by the laboratory-specific upper limit of normal (>230 ng/mL). Outcomes included critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice, or death), thrombotic events, acute kidney injury, and death during admission. Among 2377 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 and &#8805;1 D-dimer measurement, 1823 (76%) had elevated D-dimer at presentation. Patients with elevated presenting baseline D-dimer were more likely than those with normal D-dimer to have critical illness (43.9% versus 18.5%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.9-3.1]; P<0.001), any thrombotic event (19.4% versus 10.2%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.4-2.6]; P<0.001), acute kidney injury (42.4% versus 19.0%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.9-3.1]; P<0.001), and death (29.9% versus 10.8%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.6-2.9]; P<0.001). Rates of adverse events increased with the magnitude of D-dimer elevation; individuals with presenting D-dimer >2000 ng/mL had the highest risk of critical illness (66%), thrombotic event (37.8%), acute kidney injury (58.3%), and death (47%). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal D-dimer was frequently observed at admission with COVID-19 and was associated with higher incidence of critical illness, thrombotic events, acute kidney injury, and death. The optimal management of patients with elevated D-dimer in COVID-19 requires further study.","Berger, Jeffrey S; Kunichoff, Dennis; Adhikari, Samrachana; Ahuja, Tania; Amoroso, Nancy; Aphinyanaphongs, Yindalon; Cao, Meng; Goldenberg, Ronald; Hindenburg, Alexander; Horowitz, James; Parnia, Sam; Petrilli, Christopher; Reynolds, Harmony; Simon, Emma; Slater, James; Yaghi, Shadi; Yuriditsky, Eugene; Hochman, Judith; Horwitz, Leora I",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,,383

The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and to analyze the validity and reliability in children and adolescents. Method: The study sample consisted of 381 children aged 10-18 years. Cronbach's alpha internal consistency analysis was used to evaluate the scale's reliability, and the criterion validity was assessed with the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression ScaleChild (RCADS-C) subscale scores. The construct validity of the scale was examined using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Results: The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient calculated to determine the scale's reliability was a=0.88. The corrected total item test correlation values of the items varied between 0.63 and 0.68. Exploratory factor analysis determined that the factor load of the scale items was 0.73-0.77 and that there was only one factor with an eigenvalue &gt;1. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the fit indices were acceptable. Conclusion: These findings show that the Turkish version of the FCV-19S is a valid and reliable measurement tool for use with children and adolescents.","Gozpinar, Nuran Cakiroglu Suleyman Kalinii Emine Merve Ertas Erdem Gormez Vahdet",Dusunen Adam,,383

A wastewater surveillance program should provide rapid turn around for sample measurements (ideally within 24 hours), but storage of samples is necessary for a variety of reasons including biobanking. Here we investigate how storage of wastewater solids at 4 °C, −20 °C, and −80 °C affects measured concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We find that short term (7 or 8 d) storage of raw solids at 4 °C has little effect on measured concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, whereas longer term storage at 4 °C (35–122 d) or freezing reduces measurements by 60%, on average. We show that normalizing SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations by concentrations of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) RNA, an endogenous wastewater virus, can correct for changes during storage as storage can have a similar effect on PMMoV RNA as on SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The reductions in SARS-CoV-2 RNA in solids during freeze thaws is less than those reported for the same target in liquid influent by several authors.","Simpson, Adrian Topol Aaron White Bradley J.; Wolfe, Marlene K.; Wigginton, Krista R.; Boehm, Alexandria B.",PeerJ,,383

AIMS: To assess the impact of inadequate safety equipment on the mental health of service personnel deployed on operations in order to better understand the impact on those working under the similarly demanding conditions of the COVID-19 medical response. METHODS: Self-report surveys were conducted in four operational environments with 3435 personnel providing data. Surveys recorded data on socio-demographic, military and operational characteristics, mental health measures and specific occupational stressors. Analysis through logistic regression explored the association between inadequate equipment and all other factors. RESULTS: A total of 3401 personnel provided data on their perceptions of the adequacy of their equipment, of which 532 (15%) stated that they had a lot of concerns that they did not have the right equipment in working order. Analysis found significantly greater odds of reporting symptoms of common mental health disorders (CMD), 2.49 (2.03-3.06), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 2.99 (2.11-4.24), poorer global health 2.09 (1.62-2.70) and emotional problems 1.69 (1.38-2.06) when individuals reported working with inadequate equipment. Analyses remained significant when adjusted for confounding factors such as rank, sex and operational environment. CONCLUSIONS: An individual's perception of having inadequate equipment is significantly associated with symptoms of CMD, probable PTSD, poorer global health and increased reporting of emotional problems. This in turn may impact on their ability to safely carry out their duties and may have longer-term mental health consequences.","Simms, A; Fear, N T; Greenberg, N",Occup Med (Lond),,383

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between the frequencies of asthma exacerbations and respiratory infections and air pollutants before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, which were direct consequences of countermeasures undertaken for the pandemic. METHODS: Asthma exacerbations and respiratory infections among hospitalized children in the permanent population of Guangzhou City, China, from February to June 2016-2019 (before the pandemic) to February to June 2020 (during the pandemic) were collected in this cross-sectional study in Guangzhou. RESULTS: The number of asthma exacerbation cases per month documented in the Guangzhou Women and Children's Hospital before (median: 13.5; range: 0-48) and during (median: 20; range: 0-34) the mitigative response to the COVID-19 pandemic was similar. The frequency of severe asthma exacerbation cases per month decreased, whereas that of mild asthma exacerbation cases per year increased (p = .004). The number of patients hospitalized with infectious respiratory diseases decreased from 146 (range: 90-172) per month before the pandemic to 42 (range: 33-57) per month during the pandemic (p = .004). Most pathogens and air pollutants decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The frequency of severe asthma exacerbations positively correlated to that of respiratory infections in children, but did not correlate to air pollutants. CONCLUSION: Strict countermeasures undertaken for the pandemic were associated with a decreased the frequency of infectious respiratory diseases and severe asthma exacerbations among urban children.","Fan, Hui-Feng; He, Chun-Hui; Yin, Gen-Quan; Qin, Yi; Jiang, Nan; Lu, Gen; Li, Xing",Pediatr. pulmonol,,383

To offer one of the first empirical insights into the economic/financial effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the USA, this study utilized the daily frequency data for the period 25 February 2020-30 March 2020. By employing the empirical Markov switching regression approach and the compliments of cointegration techniques, the study establishes a two-state (stable and distressing) financial stress situation resulting from the effects of COVID-19 daily deaths, COVID-19 daily recovery, and the USA' economic policy uncertainty. From the result, it is assertive that daily recovery from COVID-19 eases financial stress, while the reported daily deaths from COVID-19 further hamper financial stress in the country. Moreover, the uncertainty of the USA' economic policy has also cost the Americans more financial stress and other socio-economic challenges. While the cure for COVID-19 remains elusive, as a policy instrument, the USA and similar countries with high severity of COVID-19 causalities may intensify and sustain the concerted efforts targeted at attaining a landmark recovery rate.","Alola, Andrew Adewale; Alola, Uju Violet; Sarkodie, Samuel Asumadu",Environ Dev Sustain,,383

However, this effect amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and the uneven implementation of restrictions can create a synergistic burden of diseases and health risks for the most vulnerable in low- and middle-income countries, exacerbating the health equity gap. Based on existing literature, this paper develops three key arguments: (1) COVID-19 increases the health risks of energy insecurity; (2) HEINS increases the risk of spreading COVID-19; and (3) the co-occurrence of COVID-19 and HEINS will have compounding health effects. These arguments make context-specific interventions, rather than a generic global health approach without recourse to existing vulnerabilities critical in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and mitigating the effects of energy insecurity. Targeted international efforts aimed at financing and supporting resource security, effective testing, contact tracing, and the equitable distribution of vaccines and personal protective equipment have the potential to ameliorate the synergistic effects of HEINS and COVID-19 in resource-poor countries.","Boateng, Godfred O; Phipps, Laura M; Smith, Laura E; Armah, Frederick A",Front Public Health,,383

277225,Epidemiological Surveillance of the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Stroke Care Using Artificial Intelligence,2021,"Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease that has captured the attention of the worldwide public. Modeling of such diseases can be extremely important in the prediction of their impact. While classic, statistical, modeling can provide satisfactory models, it can also fail to comprehend the intricacies contained within the data. In this paper, authors use a publicly available dataset, containing information on infected, recovered, and deceased patients in 406 locations over 51 days (22nd January 2020 to 12th March 2020). This dataset, intended to be a time-series dataset, is transformed into a regression dataset and used in training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN). The aim of training is to achieve a worldwide model of the maximal number of patients across all locations in each time unit. Hyperparameters of the MLP are varied using a grid search algorithm, with a total of 5376 hyperparameter combinations. Using those combinations, a total of 48384 ANNs are trained (16128 for each patient group-deceased, recovered, and infected), and each model is evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2). Cross-validation is performed using K-fold algorithm with 5-folds. Best models achieved consists of 4 hidden layers with 4 neurons in each of those layers, and use a ReLU activation function, with R2 scores of 0.98599 for confirmed, 0.99429 for deceased, and 0.97941 for recovered patient models. When cross-validation is performed, these scores drop to 0.94 for confirmed, 0.781 for recovered, and 0.986 for deceased patient models, showing high robustness of the deceased patient model, good robustness for confirmed, and low robustness for recovered patient model.","Car, Zlatan; Baressi Segota, Sandi; Andelic, Nikola; Lorencin, Ivan; Mrzljak, Vedran",Comput Math Methods Med,,383
278552,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will create a disease surge among cancer patients,2020,"PURPOSE: The rapid dissemination of information through social media renders a profound lens to evaluate perceptions of emerging topics, especially in the context of a global pandemic. The primary objective of this cross-sectional study was to elucidate trends on social media in the setting of surgical cancer care affected by the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe. METHODS: A public search of Twitter from April 1 to 30, 2020, was conducted, which yielded 996 posts related to COVID-19 and cancer. Two authors (E.J.K. and H.S.) individually reviewed all posts and recorded the post category, engagement, author category, and geographic location. Data were then analyzed through descriptive analyses. Only English-language posts were included, and any noncancer- or non-COVID-related posts were excluded from the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 734 unique authors from 26 different countries wrote 996 relevant posts that averaged 12.0 likes, 4.7 retweets, and 0.5 hashtags per post. Only 2.3% (23 of 996) of posts included a video. Authors of the included tweets most frequently were friends and families of patients (183; 18.4%), academic institutions or organizations (182; 18.3%), and physicians (138; 13.9%). Topics of importance were cancellations of surgeries (299; 40.1%), COVID-19 education (211; 121.2%), and research studies (93; 9.3%). The United Kingdom and the United States made up 81.5% of the cohort, followed by Canada (6.6%) and India (2.4%). Of posts where a specific type of surgery was identified (196), the most common type mentioned was breast cancer (50; 25.5%), followed by lung cancer (37; 18.9%) and urologic cancer (22; 11.2%). CONCLUSION: This analysis provides insight into the resulting impacts of COVID-19 on the global discussion of surgical cancer care.","Keil, Evan J; Navarro, Sergio M; Shaikh, Hashim; Yao, Lilian E; Tuttle, Todd M",JCO Glob Oncol,,383
278580,"Survey of COVID-19 Disease Among Orthopaedic Surgeons in Wuhan, People's Republic of China",2020,"Young children in the East Asia and the Pacific region1 are failing to thrive, in large numbers, as indicated by stagnation in the decline of stunting, wasting, and micronutrient deficiencies and the fastest growing rates of overweight in the world. Eliminating the triple burden of malnutrition is essential to ensure that, as a matter of right, all children reach their full physical growth and development potential and actively contribute to equitable prosperity and the sustainable development of their communities and nations. Ending all forms of malnutrition will only be achieved through the implementation of effective policies and programmes soundly based on an understanding of the leading contextual drivers of child malnutrition. To address the lack of data on these drivers in the region, the UNICEF regional office for East Asia and the Pacific commissioned a series of papers in 2017-2019 to fill gaps in the current body of evidence on the triple burden of maternal and child malnutrition. This series includes analyses of the determinants of child malnutrition including maternal nutrition status, dietary quality of children, inequity, and poverty. Additionally, policy and programmatic actions associated with improved coverage and quality of nutrition interventions are reviewed. This overview paper summarizes the findings of these analyses and presents recommendations for the direction of future advocacy, policy, and programmatic actions to address the triple burden of malnutrition in East Asia and the Pacific.","Blankenship, Jessica L; Rudert, Christiane; Aguayo, Victor M",Matern Child Nutr,,383

Changes to prescribing guidelines and practice have been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate UK and Ireland clinicians' experiences concerning changes in AP during the COVID-19 pandemic and their recommendations for change. METHODS: Online survey of participants at previous AP national workshops, members of the Association for Palliative Medicine of Great Britain and Ireland and other professional organisations, with snowball sampling. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-one replies were received between 9 and 19 April 2020 from clinicians in community, hospice and hospital settings across all areas of the UK and Ireland. Changes to AP local guidance and practice were reported: route of administration (47%), drugs prescribed (38%), total quantities prescribed (35%), doses and ranges (29%). Concerns over shortages of nurses and doctors to administer subcutaneous injections led 37% to consider drug administration by family or social caregivers, often by buccal, sublingual and transdermal routes. Clinical contact and patient assessment were more often remote via telephone or video (63%). Recommendations for regulatory changes to permit drug repurposing and easier community access were made. CONCLUSIONS: The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic for UK community palliative care has stimulated rapid innovation in AP. The extent to which these are implemented and their clinical efficacy need further examination.","Antunes, Bárbara; Bowers, Ben; Winterburn, Isaac; Kelly, Michael P; Brodrick, Robert; Pollock, Kristian; Majumder, Megha; Spathis, Anna; Lawrie, Iain; George, Rob; Ryan, Richella; Barclay, Stephen",BMJ Support Palliat Care,,383

The objective of this study was to evaluate pharmacological, nutritional and environmental treatments that lead to the control of COVID-19 spread. Here, we confirm that this article carries a better tomorrow and a bright future for humanity. This study assumes that a patient with COVID-19 should be treated medically by the proposed antiviral drug in this article. A diet that is low in absorbable iron (Fe2+) by using low amounts of vitamin C and high amounts of tannins or phytate inhibited Fe2+absorption. During virus spread, the following nutritional treatments should be avoided or reduced such as oysters, red meat and bats, as well as processed foods, ready-made foods, alcohol and milk. On contrary, some other foods should be increased such as poultry, fish and bread, as well as vegetables that contain a high level of sulfur such as onions and cabbage with using salt in this food. Some drinks should be increased such as chicken soup, coffee, cappuccino, black, red and green tea, mint and plenty of water. With respect to environmental treatments, it should be decreasing or changing the industrial activity to reduce toxic gas emissions in the atmosphere. The death toll was estimated at about 6.56% of the number of people infected with the virus, indicating that the diet system contributed significantly to tolerate the disease. Direct contact contributed positively in COVID-19 spreading by 84.73%. Growing plants (separately or intercropped) around homes contribute positively to reduce air pollutants and increase oxygen in the atmosphere.","Abdel-Wahab, Tamer Ibrahim; Abdel-Wahab, Sherif Ibrahim; Abdelwahab, Eman Ibrahim; Adel, Manal M.",Int.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the delta neutrophil index in predicting mortality in intensive care patients diagnosed with Coronavirus-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with a positive polymerase chain reaction test and/or computed tomography findings compatible with the disease were included in the study. The demographic characteristics of the patients, polymerase chain reaction test results, chest computed tomography findings, blood parameters at the time of presentation, 30-day mortality, and the number of days in the intensive care unit were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 388 patients receiving intensive care, 220 (56.7%) were men and 168 (43.3%) were women. The mean age was 70 ± 15 years. The evaluation of mortality, 264 (68%) of the patients survived and 124 (32%) died. The delta neutrophil index, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio, lactate, interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein values were statistically significantly higher and the lymphocyte value was significantly lower in the mortality group (P = .003, .034, .000, .002, .000 and .024, respectively). In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the area under the curve values of the delta neutrophil index, lymphocyte, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio, lactate, interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein levels in predicting mortality were 0.718, 0.416, 0.628, 0.585, 0.701 and 0.684, respectively.

281337,A descriptive study to assess the knowledge and expressed practice of community regarding prevention of corona virus disease. (Special issue on COVID-19.),2020,"The prevailing evidence suggests that patients with severe COVID-19 seem to have an overreaction of the immune system demonstrating exacerbated levels of inflammation caused by a ""cytokine storm."" At this early stage, the mechanisms underpinning COVID-19 are still subject to intense scrutiny and the long-term mental health consequences as a result of the disease are unknown. Here we discuss the hypothesis that patients who survive severe COVID-19 and who experience significant activation of the immune system, are at greater risk of developing depression. We posit that a phenomenon known as cytokine storm dramatically activates the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1), resulting in the increase in kynurenine metabolites. Kynurenine is metabolized by IDO-1 in the brain, producing chemokines, in which a prolonged exposure may result long-term brain impairment. In this article, we also propose the possibility that a SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion increases the local levels of angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 down-regulation. Thereby, angiotensin II could increase kynurenine metabolites producing pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory effects, resulting in impairment of cognitive function, enhanced oxidative stress and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor. It is our premise that patients who experience such a cytokine storm may be at increased risk of long-term mental illness, such as depression.","Bouças, Ana P; Rheinheimer, Jakeline; Lagopoulos, Jim",Neuroscientist,,383

This novelty, origin, and dispersion of COVID-19 have been reported to cause chaos, anxiety, and fear among the general population. Aim: The present study aimed to explore the correlation between different age groups, in relation to their general coping strategies, fear, and anxiety due to COVID-19. Methodology: The research study employed a total sample of 135 participants. The sample was divided into four age groups: 12-18, 19-25, 26-55, and 56-85. Participants were selected through convenience sampling. General coping strategies employed by these participants were assessed using a brief COPE scale, the COVID-19 fear scale was used to assess fear, and coronavirus anxiety scale was used to screen anxiety. Results: Our results indicated that age has a negative correlation with adaptive coping and positive correlation with problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping, and fear of COVID-19. The most used coping strategy among the age groups 12-18 and 19-25 age group was adaptive coping;for the 26-55 age group, it was problem-focused coping;and for the age group 56-85, emotion-focused coping was used the most.

Vaccine uptake may, however, be compromised by vaccine hesitancy amongst patients with mental illness, posing a critical public health issue. We conducted two surveys to provide weighted estimates of vaccine willingness amongst patients with mental illness and the general population of Denmark. Vaccine willingness was high in both groups, but slightly lower amongst patients with mental illness (84.8%), compared with the general population (89.5%) (p < .001). Based on these findings, vaccine hesitancy does not appear to be a major barrier for vaccine uptake amongst patients with mental illness in Denmark, but may be so in other countries with lower general vaccine willingness.

In this study, the psychosocial distress associated with waiting for cancer surgery during the pandemic was investigated. This cross-sectional, convergent mixed-methods study included patients with lower priority disease during the first wave of COVID-19 at an academic, tertiary care hospital in eastern Canada. Participants underwent semi-structured interviews and completed two questionnaires: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Qualitative analysis was completed through a thematic analysis approach, with integration achieved through triangulation. Fourteen participants were recruited, with cancer sites including thyroid, kidney, breast, prostate, and a gynecological disorder. Increased anxiety symptoms were found in 36% of patients and depressive symptoms in 14%. Similarly, 64% of patients experienced moderate or high stress. Six key themes were identified, including uncertainty, life changes, coping strategies, communication, experience, and health services. Participants discussed substantial distress associated with lifestyle changes and uncertain treatment timelines. Participants identified quality communication with their healthcare team and individualized coping strategies as being partially protective against such symptoms. Delays in surgery for patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in extensive psychosocial distress. Patients may be able to mitigate these symptoms partially through various coping mechanisms and improved communication with their healthcare teams.","Forner, David; Murnaghan, Sarah; Porter, Geoffrey; Mason, Ross J; Hong, Paul; Taylor, S Mark; Bentley, James; Hirsch, Gregory; Noel, Christopher W; Rigby, Matthew H; Corsten, Martin; Trites, Jonathan R; Taylor, Victoria; Kendell, Cynthia; Jorgensen, Margaret; Urquhart, Robin",Curr Oncol,,383

However, due to the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population, it is not known how long antibody responses will be maintained or whether they will provide protection from reinfection. Using sequential serum samples collected up to 94 d post onset of symptoms (POS) from 65 individuals with real-time quantitative PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we show seroconversion (immunoglobulin (Ig)M, IgA, IgG) in >95% of cases and neutralizing antibody responses when sampled beyond 8 d POS. We show that the kinetics of the neutralizing antibody response is typical of an acute viral infection, with declining neutralizing antibody titres observed after an initial peak, and that the magnitude of this peak is dependent on disease severity. Although some individuals with high peak infective dose (ID50 > 10,000) maintained neutralizing antibody titres >1,000 at >60 d POS, some with lower peak ID50 had neutralizing antibody titres approaching baseline within the follow-up period. A similar decline in neutralizing antibody titres was observed in a cohort of 31 seropositive healthcare workers. The present study has important implications when considering widespread serological testing and antibody protection against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2, and may suggest that vaccine boosters are required to provide long-lasting protection.","Seow, Jeffrey; Graham, Carl; Merrick, Blair; Acors, Sam; Pickering, Suzanne; Steel, Kathryn J A; Hemmings, Oliver; O039,; Byrne, Aoife; Kouphou, Neophytos; Galao, Rui Pedro; Betancor, Gilberto; Wilson, Harry D; Signell, Adrian W; Winstone, Helena; Kerridge, Claire; Huettner, Isabella; Jimenez-Guardeño, Jose M; Lista, Maria Jose; Temperton, Nigel; Snell, Luke B; Bisnauthsing, Karen; Moore, Amelia; Green, Adrian; Martinez, Lauren; Stokes, Brielle; Honey, Johanna; Izquierdo-Barras, Alba; Arbane, Gill; Patel, Amita; Tan, Mark Kia Ik; Connell, Lorcan; Hara, Geraldine; MacMahon, Eithne; Douthwaite, Sam; Nebbia, Gaia; Batra, Rahul; Martinez-Nunez, Rocio; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Edgeworth, Jonathan D; Neil, Stuart J D; Malim, Michael H; Doores, Katie J",Nat Microbiol,,383

287655,COVID-19 Induced Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation: A Novel Case From the United Arab Emirates,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a heterogeneous condition with more than 100 different underlying disorders that need to be differentiated to target therapeutic options, which are generally limited. METHODS: The clinical course of two brothers with pathogenic variants in the methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MARS)1 gene was compared to previously published patients. Functional studies in patient-derived fibroblasts were performed and therapeutic options evaluated. RESULTS: The younger brother was diagnosed with PAP at the age of 1 year. Exome sequencing revealed the homozygous MARS1 variant p.(Arg598Cys), leading to interstitial lung and liver disease (ILLD). At 2 years of age, following surgery hypoglycemia was detected, the pulmonary condition deteriorated, and the patient developed multiorgan failure. Six therapeutic whole lung lavages (WLL) were necessary to improve respiratory insufficiency. Methionine supplementation was started and a high protein diet ensured, leading to complete respiratory recovery. The older brother, homozygous for the same MARS1 variant, had a long-known distinct eating preference of methionine-rich food and showed a less severe clinical phenotype. Decreased aminoacylation activity confirmed the pathogenicity of p.(Arg598Cys) in vitro. In agreement with our review of currently published ILLD patients, the presence of hepatopathy, developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, and anemia support the multisystemic character of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Catabolic events can provoke a severe deterioration of the pulmonary situation in ILLD with a need for repetitive WLL. Although the precise role of oral methionine supplementation and high protein intake are unknown, we observed an apparent treatment benefit, which needs to be evaluated systematically in controlled trials.","Lenz, Dominic; Stahl, Mirjam; Seidl, Elias; Schöndorf, Dominik; Brennenstuhl, Heiko; Gesenhues, Florian; Heinzmann, Tina; Longerich, Thomas; Mendes, Marisa I; Prokisch, Holger; Salomons, Gajja S; Schön, Carola; Smith, Desirée E C; Sommerburg, Olaf; Wagner, Matias; Westhoff, Jens H; Reiter, Karl; Staufner, Christian; Griese, Matthias",Pediatr. pulmonol,,383

288713,COVID-19 and Iran: swimming with hands tied!,2020,"The article presents a comprehensive and cross-cutting review of key marine waste issues, taking into account: sources, fate, risks, transport pathways, threats, legislation, current challenges, and knowledge gaps. The growing amount of both human-created waste in seas and oceans and waste reaching marine ecosystems from land is one of today's challenges for the global economy and the European Union. It is predicted that if no decisive steps are taken to limit the amount of this type of waste, there may be more plastic waste than fish in the oceans after 2050. The influence of microplastics and nanoplastics on living organisms remains undiagnosed. Within the international and EU law, solutions are being developed to properly manage waste on board ships and to reduce the impact of processes related to the recycling of the vessels on the environment. Currently, over 80% of ships are dismantled in the countries of South Asia, in conditions that threaten the environment and the safety of workers. After World War 2, large quantities of chemical weapons were deposited in the seas. Steel containers with dangerous substances residing in the sea for over 70 years have begun leaking, thus polluting water. For many years, radioactive waste had also been dumped into marine ecosystems, although since 1993 there has been a total ban on such disposal of radionuclides. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marine waste generation has also been presented as a significant factor influencing marine waste generation and management.","Dabrowska, Jolanta; Sobota, Marcin; Swiader, Malgorzata; Borowski, Pawel; Moryl, Andrzej; Stodolak, Radoslaw; Kucharczak, Ewa; Zieba, Zofia; Kazak, Jan K",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,383
288911,COVID-19 Imaging in a Tertiary Care Setting – The Zurich Approach,2020,"Industry and academic perspectives have become more focused on designing for Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) over the past few years, both in general and particularly within the built environment. This renewed interest appears to have stemmed from a basis of respect-based 'due diligence' in 2018 to one of necessity in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic brought areas of difference into focus and exacerbated them, making it harder for people to live their everyday lives. In this paper, the authors seek to bridge the divide between academia and industry on the subject of Inclusive Design (ID) through their use of a combination of an academic and grey literature review as well as empirical research conducted with scholars and practitioners. These multiple methods focus less on the academic perspectives and more on how the industry has responded to the research and market demand. It clarifies nuanced differences among ID-related terms, provides best practice examples for wellness in the built environment, and identifies governing body guidelines (i.e., principles, protocols, policies) that have been enacted for ethical and business differentiating purposes.","Mikus, Jenna; Rieger, Janice",Stud Health Technol Inform,,383
289055,Characteristics of systematic reviews evaluating treatments for COVID-19 registered in PROSPERO,2021,"BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia is known to interfere with neurological functions; however, there is a controversy regarding the relationship between homocysteine and depression. METHODS: Science Direct, MEDLINE, and ISI Web of Science were searched to find relevant articles, published up to August 2020. Studies were included if they compared homocysteine levels in healthy subjects with subjects with depression. Also, articles that reported the association between hyperhomocysteinemia and risk of depression were included. Odds ratios of depression and means of homocysteine were used to ascertain the overall effect size. RESULTS: Homocysteine level was higher in subjects with depression in comparison with healthy controls (weight mean difference =2.53 µmol/L, 95% confidence interval: 1.77, 3.30), and the depression diagnostic tool was a source of heterogeneity. Homocysteine level was significantly higher in subjects with depression in studies that used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZDRS), and Beck Depression Index II (BDI-II) as depression diagnostic tools. Also, participants with hyperhomocysteinemia had a higher chance of depression (Pooled risk =1.34, 95% confidence interval: 1.19, 1.52), where the depression diagnostic tool was a source of heterogeneity. In contrast to ZDRS and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) subgroups, hyperhomocysteinemia yielded a significantly higher risk of depression in DSM-IV, GDS, and ""other"" subgroups. CONCLUSION: Homocysteinemia level is higher in individuals with depression. However, the depression diagnostic tool used is instrumental in influencing their association, and thus, future studies should focus on the tools for depression assessment.","Moradi, Fatemeh; Lotfi, Keyhan; Armin, Maryam; Clark, Cain C T; Askari, Gholamreza; Rouhani, Mohammad Hossein",Eur J Clin Invest,,383

While clinical parameters often point to the need for a high level of care, patients may resist pursuing higher levels of care due to these barriers. One option that might mitigate such obstacles is the provision of a higher level of care via internet-based treatment for eating disorders. We sought to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical outcomes associated with treatment of eating disorders through virtual intensive outpatient programming (VIOP). Fifty-seven patients meeting DSM-5 criteria for an eating disorder participated in VIOP. Of the 57 patients in VIOP treatment, 3 did not complete voluntary measures at admission or discharge, and 9 additional patients did not complete voluntary measures at discharge. Overall, 45 VIOP patients completed admission and discharge assessments, including a net promoter score (NPS) question assessing patient acceptability. Recruitment, treatment adherence, and completion of assessments in VIOP were feasible and acceptable. VIOP patients showed significant and clinically meaningful improvements in all outcomes measured, including self-reported eating disorder symptoms, depression, self-esteem, quality of life, and overall satisfaction. VIOP appears feasible, acceptable, and evidences clinically meaningful changes in eating and mood disorder symptoms.","Blalock, Dan V; Le Grange, Daniel; Johnson, Craig; Duffy, Alan; Manwaring, Jamie; Tallent, Casey N; Schneller, Karen; Solomon, Ashley M; Mehler, Philip S; McClanahan, Susan F; Rienecke, Renee D",,,383
290115,The importance of COVID-19 screening and testing in the obstetric patient population,2020,"BACKGROUND: Venlafaxine (selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) use has increased worldwide. However, the impact of venlafaxine on testes and sperm parameters has not been investigated. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated venlafaxine impact on testicular and sperm parameters and verified whether the changes are reversible. METHODS: Animals from venlafaxine-35 days and venlafaxine-65 days groups received 30 mg/kg of venlafaxine for 35 days. Control-35 days and control-65 days received distilled water. In control-65 days and venlafaxine-65 days, the treatment was interrupted for 30 days. Sperm concentration, morphology, motility, and mitochondrial activity were analyzed. Number of step 19 spermatids (NLS), frequency of tubules with spermiation failure, Sertoli cells number, and TUNEL-positive germ cells were quantified. Testicular aromatase, connexin 43 (Cx43) immunoexpression, Cx43 protein levels, and Cx43 expression were evaluated. Either intratesticular testosterone or estrogen levels were measured. RESULTS: Venlafaxine impaired sperm morphology, reduced sperm concentration, mitochondrial activity, and sperm motility. The frequency of tubules with spermiation failure and NLS increased in parallel to increased Cx43 immunoexpression; mRNA and protein levels; and aromatase, testosterone, and estrogen levels. An increase in germ cell death and decreased Sertoli cells number were observed. In venlafaxine-65 days, except for sperm motility, mitochondrial activity, Sertoli cells number, and germ cell death, all other parameters were partially or totally recovered. CONCLUSION: Venlafaxine increases testosterone aromatization and Cx43. This drug, via high estrogen levels, disturbs Sertoli cells, induces germ cell death, and impairs spermiation and sperm parameters. The restoration of spermiation associated with the decreased Cx43 and hormonal levels in venlafaxine-65 days reinforces that high estrogen levels are related to venlafaxine-induced changes. The presence of damaged Sertoli cells, germ cell death, and low sperm motility in venlafaxine-65 days indicates that interruption of treatment for 30 days was insufficient for testicular recovery and points to a long-term estrogen impact on the seminiferous epithelium.","de Santi, Fabiane; Beltrame, Flávia L; Rogridues, Beatriz M; Junior, Marcio J V P; Scaramele, Natália F; Lopes, Flávia L; Cerri, Paulo S; Sasso-Cerri, Estela",Androl.

First, in Wuhan, China, the novel SARS-CoV2 was named by the World Health Organization (WHO), as 2019-nCOV (COVID-19), and spread extremely all over the world. SARS-CoV2 is transmitted to individuals by human-to-human transmission leading to severe viral pneumonia and respiratory system injury. SARS-CoV2 elicits infections from the common cold to severe conditions accompanied by lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and other organ destruction. There is a possibility of virus transmission from asymptomatic cases as active carriers, in addition to symptomatic ones, which is a crucial crisis of COVID-19 that should be considered. Hence, paying more attention to the accurate and immediate diagnosis of suspected and infected cases can be a great help in preventing the rapid spread of the virus, improving the disease prognosis, and controlling the pandemic. In this review, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the different types of Clinical and Para-clinical diagnostic methods and their practical features, which can help understand better the applications and capacities of various diagnostic approaches for COVID-19 infected cases.","Tahmasebi, Safa; Khosh, Elnaz; Esmaeilzadeh, Abdolreza",J Cell Physiol,,383

The particular commodity examined is soft red winter (SRW) wheat, and the timeframe is early February to late March 2020. The analysis highlights various adjustments in the cash and futures price of SRW wheat in light of surging short-run demand from consumer hoarding of staple food products, and a weakening long-run market from growing wheat stocks and an emerging global recession. This split is causing the forward curve to flatten and basis levels to invert. The change over time in the price of options on wheat futures reveals increased price volatility in response to growing uncertainty about the COVID-19 impacts. Similarly, changes in the skewness of the option's volatility smile illustrate a shift in traders’ perception about risk in the right versus left tail of the price distribution.","Vercammen, James",Can.

A Novel Strategy to Tackle COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a global impact, including in health services, placing health professionals under enormous tension, pressure, and stress. Professionals involved in the care, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19-infected patients have been subject to emotional and physical distress that can potentially enhance the development of occupational diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of burnout among Portuguese radiographers. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, quantitative study. Burnout levels were estimated using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey, composed of 22 questions. Specific questions were developed to characterize the socio-demographic situation and the impact of the pandemic on the radiographers. Data were descriptively analyzed and Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for correlation analysis. RESULTS: The study sample comprised 386 radiographers, 68.7% of whom where female and 31.3% male. The mean sample age was 36.3 (±9.1) years. A total of 43.5% and 45.5% of subjects had a high level of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, respectively, and 59.8% experienced low personal accomplishment. Altogether, 23.3% of study participants were at high risk of burnout in the three dimensions assessed and 77.2% in at least one. CONCLUSION: Study results showed that radiographers were at high risk of developing burnout in the COVID-19 pandemic setting. Health institutions should actively monitor these professional's mental health and develop restorative strategies that enable their emotional wellbeing, preventing absenteeism and increasing patients' quality of care. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Burnout of health professionals has a strong impact on health services organization, resulting in increased absenteeism and error probability, frequent work delays, low productivity and job satisfaction, inter- and intra-professional conflicts, high job turnover, high job quit, and decreased quality of care perceived by users.","Pereira, J M; Silva, C; Freitas, D; Salgado, A","Radiography (Lond.

METHODS: Influenza VE in children was estimated in the first influenza season (2019/20) overlapping with the COVID-19 epidemic by conducting a single-center, test-negative case-control (TNCC) study. Effects of prior influenza infection and vaccination in children were assessed for the 2019-2020 season. RESULTS: Among 386 children, the adjusted VE was significant for influenza A/H1N1 (45.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-69.7) and influenza B (66.7%; 95% CI: 35.9-82.7). Among patients aged 0-6 years, the adjusted VE was significant for influenza A (total: A/H1N1+A/H3N2) (65.0%; 95% CI: 22.2-84.3), influenza A/H1N1 (64.8%; 95% CI: 16.9-85.1), and influenza B (87.4%; 95% CI: 50.5-96.8). No VE was observed in patients aged 7-15 years. Two vaccine doses tended to decrease the incidences of influenza A (total) and influenza A/H1N1 in patients aged 0-6 years. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of influenza B infection in patients, who had influenza during the previous season, were significantly low among all participants (0.29; 95% CI: 0.11-0.78) and patients aged 7-15 years (0.34; 95% CI: 0.12-0.94). The adjusted ORs of influenza infections were not significant in patients vaccinated during the previous season.

Molecular detection based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, high false negative rates were reported. We describe here the development of a point-of-care (POC) serological assay for the detection of IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2. The principle of a lateral flow immunoassay strip (LFIAs) consists of fixing SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein to the surface of the strip and coupling anti-human IgG with colloidal gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). A series of parameters of this method were optimized, including the concentration of coating antigen, BSA blocking concentration and pH value for conjugation. The entire detection process took 15-20 min with a volume of 80 µL of the analyte solution containing 10 µL of serum and 70 µL sample diluent. The performance of the established assay was evaluated using serum samples of the clinically diagnosed cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our results indicated that the LFIAs for SARS-CoV-2 had satisfactory stability and reproducibility. As a result, our fast and easy LFIAs could provide a preliminary test result for physicians to make the correct diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections along with alternative testing methods and clinical findings, as well as seroprevalence determination, especially in low-resource countries.","Wen, Tian; Huang, Chao; Shi, Feng-Juan; Zeng, Xiao-Yan; Lu, Tian; Ding, Shou-Nian; Jiao, Yong-Jun",Analyst,,383

Although most infections are mild, patients with severe and critical COVID-19 infections face deterioration of respiratory function and may also have extrapulmonary manifestations, mostly affecting the kidney, digestive tract, heart, and nervous system. Here, we prospectively evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in urine samples obtained from patients with COVID-19 receiving critical care. Among 51 included patients, we found higher serum creatinine levels, a longer hospital stay, and more frequent need for dialysis in urine-positive patients. These findings could suggest that, in predisposed patients, a direct viral cytopathic effect may contribute to a more severe disease phenotype.","de Souza, Sérgio Pinto; Silveira, Marcelo Augusto Duarte; Souza, Bruno Solano de Freitas; Cabral, Julia Barros; de Melo, Erica Batista Dos Santos Galvão; Nonaka, Carolina Kymie Vasques; Coelho, Fernanda Oliveira; da Hora Passos, Rogério",J Int Med Res,,383
291562,Neurological Symptoms of COVID-19: The Zonulin Hypothesis,2021,"Edge-coloured directed graphs provide an essential structure for modelling and computing complex problems arising in many scientific disciplines. The size of edge-coloured graphs appearing in practice can be enormous in the number of both vertices and colours. An important fundamental problem that needs to be solved over edge-coloured graphs is detecting strongly connected components. The problem becomes challenging for large graphs with a large number of colours. In this paper, we describe a novel symbolic algorithm that computes all the monochromatic strongly connected components of an edge-coloured graph. In the worst case, the algorithm performs $O(p \cdot n \cdot \log n)$ symbolic steps, where $p$ is the number of colours and $n$ is the number of vertices. We evaluate the algorithm using an experimental implementation based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) and large (up to $2^{48}$) coloured graphs produced by models appearing in systems biology.","Benevs, Nikola; Brim, Lubovs; Pastva, Samuel; vSafr'anek, David",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13113v1.pdf,383

Particularly, telemedicine has become the primary modality of patient visits for nonemergent conditions. This study aimed to characterize user experiences of neurosurgeons and advanced practice providers focusing on perceived utility and barriers of telemedicine in management of elective neurosurgical patients during COVID-19. METHODS: An online survey was sent to clinicians involved in neurosurgical care using telemedicine with questions focusing on frequency of utilization, duration of patient encounters, benefits of telemedicine, and barriers to current forms of remote patient visits. Survey responses were stratified by clinical position (neurosurgeon vs. advanced practice provider) and subspecialty focus (cranial vs. spinal neurosurgery). RESULTS: The survey was completed by 14 of 17 eligible clinicians. Respondents included 10 neurosurgeons and 4 APPs with 57% specializing in cranial neurosurgery and 43% specializing in spinal neurosurgery. During the COVID-19 period, 78% of respondents used teleconference/video conference visits multiple times in a week, and 86% planned to continue using telemedicine after the pandemic. The most common barrier for telemedicine was the inability to perform a neurological examination, while the most common perceived benefit was increased convenience for patients. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 period, telemedicine was heavily relied on to ensure the continuation of perioperative care for patients with elective neurosurgical pathologies. While clinicians identified numerous barriers for current telemedicine platforms, the use of telemedicine will likely continue, as it has provided unique benefits for patients, clinicians, and hospitals.","Ryu, Won Hyung A; Kerolus, Mena G; Traynelis, Vincent C",World neurosurgery (Online),,383

This study describes a methodology where departmental publications are used to analyse the ways in which computer scientists share research data. All journal articles published by researchers in the computer science department of the case studys university during 2019 were extracted for scrutiny from the current research information system. For these 193 articles, a coding framework was developed to capture the key elements of acquiring and sharing research data. Furthermore, a rudimentary classification of the main study types exhibited in the investigated articles was developed to accommodate the multidisciplinary nature of the case departments research agenda. Human interaction and intervention studies often collected original data, whereas research on novel computational methods and life sciences more frequently used openly available data. Articles that made data available for reuse were most often in life science studies, whereas data sharing was least frequent in human interaction studies. The use of open code was most frequent in life science studies and novel computational methods. The findings highlight that multidisciplinary research organisations may include diverse subfields that have their own cultures of data sharing, and suggest that research information system-based methods may be valuable additions to the questionnaire and interview methodologies eliciting insight into researchers data sharing.

While a number of different cardiovascular histopathologies have been described at post-mortem examination, the incidence of typical viral myocarditis in COVID-19 positive patients appears very low [1-3]. In this study, we further characterize and quantify the inflammatory cell infiltrate in a COVID-19 study cohort and compare the findings to both an age and disease matched control cohort and a cohort of patients diagnosed with typical inflammatory myocarditis. All study and control cohorts had 1 or more of the comorbidities most commonly associated with severe disease (hypertension, type II diabetes, obesity, or known cardiovascular disease). The results demonstrate a skewed distribution of the number of CD68+ cells in COVID-19 hearts, with upper quantiles showing a significant increase as compared to both matched control hearts, and those with myocarditis. In contrast, hearts from typical inflammatory myocarditis contained increased numbers of CD4+, and CD8+ cells compared to both COVID-19 and control cohorts. In conclusion, the presence of an increased number of CD68+ cells suggests that COVID-19 may incite a form of myocarditis different from typical viral myocarditis, and associated with diffusely infiltrative cells of monocytes/macrophage lineage.","Fox, Sharon E; Falgout, Lacey; Vander Heide, Richard S",Cardiovasc Pathol,,383

295229,Integrated Survival Estimates for Cancer Treatment Delay Among Adults With Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"PURPOSE: Nasal irrigation or nebulizing aerosol of isotonic or hypertonic saline is a traditional method for respiratory or nasal care. A recent small study in outpatients with COVID-19 without acute respiratory distress syndrome suggests substantial symptom resolution. We therefore analyzed pharmacological/pharmacodynamic effects of isotonic or hypertonic saline, relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory care. METHODS: Mixed search method. RESULTS: Due to its wetting properties, saline achieves an improved spreading of alveolar lining fluid and has been shown to reduce bio-aerosols and viral load. Saline provides moisture to respiratory epithelia and gels mucus, promotes ciliary beating, and improves mucociliary clearance. Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 damage ciliated epithelium in the nose and airways. Saline inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells; possible interactions involve the viral ACE2-entry mechanism (chloride-dependent ACE2 configuration), furin and 3CLpro (inhibition by NaCl), and the sodium channel ENaC. Saline shifts myeloperoxidase activity in epithelial or phagocytic cells to produce hypochlorous acid. Clinically, nasal or respiratory airway care with saline reduces symptoms of seasonal coronaviruses and other common cold viruses. Its use as aerosol reduces hospitalization rates for bronchiolitis in children. Preliminary data suggest symptom reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 patients if saline is initiated within 48 h of symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: Saline interacts at various levels relevant to nasal or respiratory hygiene (nasal irrigation, gargling or aerosol). If used from the onset of common cold symptoms, it may represent a useful add-on to first-line interventions for COVID-19. Formal evaluation in mild COVID-19 is desirable as to establish efficacy and optimal treatment regimens.","Huijghebaert, Suzy; Hoste, Levi; Vanham, Guido",Eur. j. clin. pharmacol,,383

In the COVID-19 situation, finding targets for drug repurposing can be an effective way to present new fast treatments. We have designed a two-step solution to address this approach. In the first step, we identify essential proteins from virus targets or their associated modules in human cells as possible drug target candidates. For this purpose, we apply two different algorithms to detect some candidate sets of proteins with a minimum size that drive a significant disruption in the COVID-19 related biological networks. We evaluate the resulted candidate proteins sets with three groups of drugs namely Covid-Drug, Clinical-Drug, and All-Drug. The obtained candidate proteins sets approve 16 drugs out of 18 in the Covid-Drug, 273 drugs out of 328 in the Clinical-Drug, and a large number of drugs in the All-Drug. In the second step, we study COVID-19 associated proteins sets and recognize proteins that are essential to disease pathology. This analysis is performed using DAVID to show and compare essential proteins that are contributed between the COVID-19 comorbidities. Our results for shared proteins show significant enrichment for cardiovascular-related, hypertension, diabetes type 2, kidney-related and lung-related diseases.","Habibi, Mahnaz; Taheri, Golnaz; Aghdam, Rosa",Sci Rep,,383

295973,Can Tofacitinib Offer Protection against COVID-19 Infection?,2021,"SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has emerged as a global threat to humankind and is rapidly spreading. The infectivity, pathogenesis and infection of this virus are dependent on the interaction of SARS-CoV2 spike protein with human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Spike protein contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that recognizes hACE-2. In the present study, we are reporting a de novo designed novel hybrid antiviral 'VTAR-01' molecule that binds at the interface of RBD-hACE2 interaction. A series of antiviral molecules were tested for binding at the interface of RBD-hACE2 interaction. In silico screening, molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) analysis suggest ribavirin, ascorbate, lopinavir and hydroxychloroquine have strong interaction at the RBD-hACE2 interface. These four molecules were used for de novo fragment-based antiviral design. De novo designing, docking and MDS analysis identified a 'VTAR' hybrid molecule that has better interaction with this interface than all of the antivirals used to design it. We have further used retrosynthetic analysis and combinatorial synthesis to design 100 variants of VTAR molecules. Retrosynthetic analysis and combinatorial synthesis, along with docking and MDS, identified that VTAR-01 interacts with the interface of the RBD-ACE2 complex. MDS analysis confirmed its interaction with the RBD-ACE2 interface by involving Glu35 and Lys353 of ACE2, as well as Gln493 and Ser494 of RBD. Interaction of spike protein with ACE2 is essential for pathogenesis and infection of this virus; hence, this i n s ilico designed hybrid antiviral molecule (VTAR-01) that binds at the interface of RBD-hACE2 may be further developed to control the infection of SARS-CoV2.","Tiwari, Vishvanath",,,383

In 2020, in an unprecedented scientific achievement, several vaccines were developed, underwent clinical trials, and were distributed worldwide. This was made possible, in part, by Operation Warp Speed, which promoted mass production of multiple vaccines through different technological platforms, relying on preliminary evidence to allow faster distribution as soon as clinical trials confirmed one or more of those vaccines to be safe and effective.

We also conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the associations between human mobility (i.e., subway ridership) on the week of April 11, 2020, sociodemographic factors, and COVID-19 incidence as of April 26, 2020. Areas with lower median income, a greater percentage of individuals who identify as non-white and/or Hispanic/Latino, a greater percentage of essential workers, and a greater percentage of healthcare essential workers had greater mobility during the pandemic. When adjusted for the percent of essential workers, these associations do not remain, suggesting essential work drives human movement in these areas. Increased mobility and all sociodemographic variables (except percent older than 75 years old and percent of healthcare essential workers) was associated with a higher rate of COVID-19 cases per 100k, when adjusted for testing effort.

Adaptation of commercially available snorkel masks to serve as full face masks has been proposed. Even not formally approved as PPD, they are publicized on social media as suitable for this use. Concerns about actual protection levels and risk of carbon dioxide (CO2) accumulation while wearing them for extended periods made us perform a systematic testing of various brands, in order to verify whether they are as safe and effective as claimed. Methods: A 'fit' test was performed, analogous to gas mask testing. Respiratory safety was evaluated by measuring end-tidal CO2 and oxygen saturation while wearing the masks in rest and during physical exercise. Masks were tested with 3D adaptors to mount regular bacterial-viral ventilator filters when available, or with snorkel openings covered with N95/FFP2 cloth. Results: Modified masks performed reasonably well on the fit test, comparable to regular N95/FFP2 masks. Not all ventilator filters are equally protective. For all masks, a small initial increase in end-tidal CO2 was noted, remaining within physiological limits. 3D printed adaptors are safer, have more flexibility and reliability than makeshift adaptations. Conclusions: These masks can offer benefit as a substitute for complete protective gear as they are easier to don and remove and offer full-face protection. They may be more comfortable to wear for extended periods. Proper selection of mask size, fit testing, quality of 3D printed parts, and choice of filter are important.","Germonpre, Peter; Van Rompaey, Dirk; Balestra, Costantino",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,383

Serially 10-fold diluted solutions of catechin mixture reagent from green tea were mixed with the viral culture fluid at a volume ratio of nine to one, respectively, and kept at room temperature for 5 min. The solution of 10 mg/mL catechin reagent reduced the viral titer by 4.2 log and 1.0 mg/mL solution reduced only by one log. Pre-infection treatment of the cells with the reagent alone did not affect the viral growth. In addition, cells treated with only the reagent was assayed for host-cell viability using the WST-8 system and almost no host-cell damage by the treatment was observed. These findings suggested that the direct treatment of virus with the reagent before inoculation decreased the viral activity and that catechins might have a potential to suppress the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Nishimura, Hidekazu; Okamoto, Michiko; Dapat, Isolde; Katumi, Masanori; Oshitani, Hitoshi",Jpn. j. infect. dis,,383

The COVID-19 pandemic presents a potential developmental immune challenge to the fetal brain, in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection with its attendant potential for cytokine production and, in severe cases, cytokine storming. There is currently no biomarker or model for in utero microglial priming and function that might aid in identifying the neonates and children most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental morbidity, as microglia remain inaccessible in fetal life and after birth. This study aimed to generate patient-derived microglial-like cell models unique to each neonate from reprogrammed umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells, adapting and extending a novel methodology previously validated for adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrate that umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells can be used to create microglial-like cell models morphologically and functionally similar to microglia observed in vivo. We illustrate the application of this approach by generating microglia from cells exposed and unexposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our ability to create personalized neonatal models of fetal brain immune programming enables non-invasive insights into fetal brain development and potential childhood neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities for a range of maternal exposures, including COVID-19.","Sheridan, Steven D; Thanos, Jessica M; De Guzman, Rose M; McCrea, Liam T; Horng, Joy E; Fu, Ting; Sellgren, Carl M; Perlis, Roy H; Edlow, Andrea G",Transl Psychiatry,,383

303315,A Case Series: Successfully Preventing COVID-19 Outbreak in a Residential Community Setting at a Drug and Alcohol Addiction Treatment Center,2021,"PURPOSE: During the COVID-19 surge months of March and April 2020, our New York multicenter health system experienced an influx of cases with COVID-19. We sought to study the impact of the surge period on patients with cancer prescribed radiation treatment (RT). METHODS: We reviewed our secure departmental quality assurance database for all patients who underwent RT planning simulations from March 6, 2020, through April 30, 2020. A priority level between 1 and 3 was prospectively assigned to each case based on faculty consensus to determine which patients required immediate RT. In May 2020, each faculty physician again retrospectively reviewed their patients from the database and provided additional commentary on how the COVID-19 pandemic had affected each patient's care. All statistics are descriptive. RESULTS: A total of 412 RT courses in 406 unique patients were simulated for linear accelerator-based external beam RT. The median age was 66 years. Treatment intent was curative in 70.6% and palliative in 29.4%. Of the 412 cases, 66.7% were priority 1, 25% priority 2, and 7.8% priority 3. Two hundred thirty-nine cases (58%) underwent standard-of-care diagnosis, workup, and treatment plan. Seventeen patients (4.1%) electively canceled their RT, and 17 others (4.1%) electively delayed RT start. Thirty-four (8.3%) were prescribed hypofractionation to shorten their RT course, and 22 (5.3%) had a change in modality. Incomplete or delayed workup was identified in 19 cases (4.6%). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic surge resulted in 42% of our patients having a non-standard-of-care pathway. This outcome demonstrates a significant impact of the COVID-19 crisis on routine cancer care.","Teckie, Sewit; Andrews, Janna Zeola; Chen, William Chun-Ying; Goenka, Anuj; Koffler, Daniel; Adair, Nilda; Potters, Louis",JCO Oncol Pract,,383

METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched till August 3, 2020 to identify studies reporting COVID-19 patients with DKA and combined DKA/HHS. A total of 19 articles reporting 110 patients met the eligibility criteria. RESULTS: Of the 110 patients, 91 (83%) patients had isolated DKA while 19 (17%) had DKA/HHS. The majority of the patients were male (63%) and belonged to black ethnicity (36%). The median age at presentation ranged from 45.5 to 59.0 years. Most of the patients (77%) had pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Only 10% of the patients had newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. The median blood glucose at presentation ranged from 486.0 to 568.5 mg/dl, being higher in patients with DKA/HHS compared to isolated DKA. The volume of fluid replaced in the first 24 h was higher in patients with DKA/HHS in contrast to patients with DKA alone. The in-hospital mortality rate was 45%, with higher mortality in the DKA/HHS group than in the isolated DKA group (67% vs. 29%). pH was lower in patients who had died compared to those who were discharged. CONCLUSION: DKA in COVID-19 patients portends a poor prognosis with a mortality rate approaching 50%. Differentiating isolated DKA from combined DKA/HHS is essential as the latter represents nearly one-fifth of the DKA cases and tends to have higher mortality than DKA alone.","Pal, Rimesh; Banerjee, Mainak; Yadav, Urmila; Bhattacharjee, Sukrita",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,383

Data from patients with severe clinical manifestations compared to patients with mild symptoms indicate that highly dysregulated exuberant inflammatory responses correlate with severity of disease and lethality. Epithelial-immune cell interactions and elevated cytokine and chemokine levels, i.e. cytokine storm, seem to play a central role in severity and lethality in COVID-19. The present perspective places a central cellular pro-inflammatory signal pathway, NF-&#954;B, in the context of recently published data for COVID-19 and provides a hypothesis for a therapeutic approach aiming at the simultaneous inhibition of whole cascades of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The simultaneous inhibition of multiple cytokines/chemokines is expected to have much higher therapeutic potential as compared to single target approaches to prevent cascade (i.e. redundant, triggering, amplifying, and synergistic) effects of multiple induced cytokines and chemokines in critical stage COVID-19 patients.","Kircheis, Ralf; Haasbach, Emanuel; Lueftenegger, Daniel; Heyken, Willm T; Ocker, Matthias; Planz, Oliver",Front Immunol,,383

305717,Tech-imprisonment in post.millennials: A boon or bane in the COVID-19 era?,2020,"Issue: Calls to change medical education have been frequent, persistent, and generally limited to alterations in content or structural re-organization. Self-imposed barriers have prevented adoption of more radical pedagogical approaches, so recent predictions of the 'inevitability' of medical education transitioning to online delivery seemed unlikely. Then in March 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic forced medical schools to overcome established barriers overnight and make the most rapid curricular shift in medical education's history. We share the collated reports of nine medical schools and postulate how recent responses may influence future medical education. Evidence: While extraneous pandemic-related factors make it impossible to scientifically distinguish the impact of the curricular changes, some themes emerged. The rapid transition to online delivery was made possible by all schools having learning management systems and key electronic resources already blended into their curricula; we were closer to online delivery than anticipated. Student engagement with online delivery varied with different pedagogies used and the importance of social learning and interaction along with autonomy in learning were apparent. These are factors known to enhance online learning, and the student-centered modalities (e.g. problem-based learning) that included them appeared to be more engaging. Assumptions that the new online environment would be easily adopted and embraced by 'technophilic' students did not always hold true. Achieving true distance medical education will take longer than this 'overnight' response, but adhering to best practices for online education may open a new realm of possibilities. Implications: While this experience did not confirm that online medical education is really 'inevitable,' it revealed that it is possible. Thoughtfully blending more online components into a medical curriculum will allow us to take advantage of this environment's strengths such as efficiency and the ability to support asynchronous and autonomous learning that engage and foster intrinsic learning in our students. While maintaining aspects of social interaction, online learning could enhance pre-clinical medical education by allowing integration and collaboration among classes of medical students, other health professionals, and even between medical schools. What remains to be seen is whether COVID-19 provided the experience, vision and courage for medical education to change, or whether the old barriers will rise again when the pandemic is over.","Binks, Andrew P; LeClair, Renée J; Willey, Joanne M; Brenner, Judith M; Pickering, James D; Moore, Jesse S; Huggett, Kathryn N; Everling, Kathleen M; Arnott, John A; Croniger, Colleen M; Zehle, Christa H; Kranea, N Kevin; Schwartzstein, Richard M",Teach Learn Med,,383

Potential correlations were sought between epidemiological, clinical and immunological characteristics of patients and the persistence of OD at 60 days. METHODS: COVID-19 positive patients presenting OD were prospectively recruited from three European hospitals. Baseline clinical and olfactory evaluations were performed within the first 2 weeks after OD onset and repeated at 30 and 60 days. In a subgroup of patients, anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies were measured in serum, saliva and nasal secretions at 60 days. RESULTS: A total of 288 COVID-19 patients with OD were included in the study. Two weeks after the onset of the loss of smell, 52.4% of patients had OD on psychophysical tests, including 113 cases (39.2%) of anosmia and 38 cases (13.2%) of hyposmia. At 60-day follow-up, 25.4% of the patients presented persistent OD. There was no significant correlation between sex, age, viral load on nasopharyngeal swab or COVID-19 severity and poor olfactory outcome. In a subgroup of 63 patients, it was demonstrated that patients with poor olfactory outcomes at 60 days had lower levels of salivary and nasal immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG1, but similar levels of antibodies in the serum.

306012,Psychosocial effects and clinic reflections of the COVID-19 outbreak in patients with acromegaly and Cushing's disease,2021,"Hand hygiene is an essential factor to prevent or minimize the spread of infections. The ability to prepare an alcohol-free hand sanitizer (AFHS) with antimicrobial properties is crucial, especially during pandemics, when there are high demands and a low supply chain for ethanol and isopropanol. The objective of this study was to prepare AFHS gels based on natural materials that contain essential oils (EOs) that would be effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens. The results showed that the organoleptic characteristics of all prepared hand sanitizer gels were considered acceptable. The pH of the formulations was slightly acidic (circa 3.9) owing to the presence of aloe vera in large proportions (90% v/v), which is known for its acidity. The spreadability for all tested formulations was in the acceptable range. The antimicrobial effectiveness test demonstrated that the prepared hand sanitizer gels had antimicrobial activities against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and Candida albicans yeast. The highest antibacterial effect was observed with tea tree oil hand sanitizers, which lack activity against the yeast, while clove oil hand sanitizers showed effectiveness against all microorganisms, including Candida albicans. The lavender hand sanitizer exhibited the least antimicrobial efficiency. The acceptability study on 20 human volunteers showed that the hand sanitizer gel containing 1.25% (v/v) clove oil did not produce any signs of skin irritation. This study suggested that the prepared natural hand sanitizer gel with 1.25% (v/v) clove oil can be a potential alternative to commonly used alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS).","Booq, Rayan Y; Alshehri, Abdullah A; Almughem, Fahad A; Zaidan, Nada M; Aburayan, Walaa S; Bakr, Abrar A; Kabli, Sara H; Alshaya, Hassa A; Alsuabeyl, Mohammed S; Alyamani, Essam J; Tawfik, Essam A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,383

It is the total of anatomical, physiological, and psychological domains of an individual. The diseases often manifest by susceptibility that depends upon Prakriti of individuals. COVID 19 is a new disease, where the status of the susceptibility of its victim in terms of Prakriti is not known. This study has been undertaken to determine the Prakriti of COVID 19 positive patients. Method: The validated instrument CCRAS Prakriti assessment scale has been applied to the COVID 19 positive patients admitted between 16 May 2020 to 10 June 2020 at COVID hospital. Result: Data of 117 patients aged 10 to 80 years have been analyzed. The ratio of male-female patients was 1.8:1. Most patients belonged to Vata-KaphaPrakriti (27%).Individuals with their Prakriti found in order of frequency were Pitta-Kapha (21%), Kapha (20%), Vata (13%), Vata-Pitta (11%), Sama (4%) and Pitta (3%). Conclusion: Patients with Vata-Kapha, Pitta-Kapha, and Kapha dominant Prakriti have been found more in COVID19.

Knowledge of antibody seropositivity and its duration may help dictate post-pandemic planning. Methods: Using assays to detect antibodies to either nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) proteins performed on specimens from 39,086 individuals with confirmed positive COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from March 2020 to January 2021, we analyzed nationwide seropositivity rates of IgG up to 300 days following patients' initial positive NAAT test. Linear regression identified trends in seropositivity rates and logistic regression tested positive predictability by age, sex, assay type and days post-infection. Findings: Seropositivity of IgG antibodies to both SARS-CoV-2 S and N-proteins followed a linear trend reaching approximately 90% positivity at 21 days post-index. The rate of N-protein seropositivity declined at a sharper rate, decaying to 68·2% [95% CI: 63·1-70·8%] after 293 days, while S-antibody seropositivity maintained a rate of 87·8% [95% CI: 86·3-89·1%] through 300 days. In addition to antigen type and the number of days post-positive PCR, age and gender were also significant factors in seropositivity prediction, with those under 65 years of age showing a more sustained seropositivity rate. Interpretation: Observational data from a national clinical laboratory, though limited by an epidemiological view of the U.S. population, offer an encouraging timeline for the development and sustainability of antibodies up to ten months from natural infection and could inform post-pandemic planning.","Alfego, David; Sullivan, Adam; Poirier, Brian; Williams, Jonathan; Adcock, Dorothy; Letovsky, Stanley",EClinicalMedicine,,383

309364,A survey on burnout and depression risk among anaesthetists during COVID-19: the tip of an iceberg?,2020,"Although most patients recover from COVID-19, it has been linked to cardiac, pulmonary, and neurologic complications. Despite not having formal criteria for its diagnosis, COVID-19 associated cardiomyopathy has been observed in several studies through biomarkers and imaging. This study aims to estimate the proportion of COVID-19 patients with cardiac abnormalities and to determine the association between the cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients and disease severity and mortality. Observational studies published from December 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020 were obtained from electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI) and preprint servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv, ChinaXiv). Studies that have data on prevalence were included in the calculation of the pooled prevalence, while studies with comparison group were included in the calculation of the odds ratio. If multiple tests were done in the same study yielding different prevalence values, the largest one was used as the measure of prevalence of that particular study. Metafor using R software package version 4.0.2 was used for the meta-analysis. A total of 400 records were retrieved from database search, with 24 articles included in the final analysis. Pooled prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in 20 studies was calculated to be 0.31 [95% Confidence Intervals (CI) of (0.23; 0.41)], with statistically significant heterogeneity (percentage of variation or I-squared statistic I2 = 97%, p < 0.01). Pooled analysis of 19 studies showed an overall odds ratio (OR) of 6.87 [95%-CI (3.92; 12.05)] for cardiac abnormalities associated with disease severity and mortality, with statistically significant heterogeneity (I2 = 85%, between-study variance or tau-squared statistic &#964;2 = 1.1485, p < 0.01). Due to the high uncertainty in the pooled prevalence of cardiac abnormalities and the unquantifiable magnitude of risk (although an increased risk is certain) for severity or mortality among COVID-19 patients, much more long-term prognostic studies are needed to check for the long-term complications of COVID-19 and formalize definitive criteria of ""COVID-19 associated cardiomyopathy"".","Dy, Louie F; Lintao, Ryan C V; Cordero, Cynthia P; Cabaluna, Ian Theodore G; Dans, Leonila F",Sci Rep,,383

This study focused on analyzing content from Twitter related to masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Twitter data were collected using the keyword ""mask"" from 27 June 2020 to 4 July 2020. The total number of tweets gathered were n = 452,430. A systematic random sample of 1% (n = 4525) of tweets was analyzed using social network analysis. NodeXL (Social Media Research Foundation, California, CA, USA) was used to identify users ranked influential by betweenness centrality and was used to identify key hashtags and content. RESULTS: The overall shape of the network resembled a community network because there was a range of users conversing amongst each other in different clusters. It was found that a range of accounts were influential and/or mentioned within the network. These ranged from ordinary citizens, politicians, and popular culture figures. The most common theme and popular hashtags to emerge from the data encouraged the public to wear masks. CONCLUSION: Towards the end of June 2020, Twitter was utilized by the public to encourage others to wear masks and discussions around masks included a wide range of users.","Ahmed, Wasim; Vidal-Alaball, Josep; Lopez Segui, Francesc; Moreno-Sánchez, Pedro A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,383

One line of research has focused on targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteins fundamental for its replication by repurposing drugs approved for other diseases. The first interaction between the virus and the host cell is mediated by the spike protein on the virus surface and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2). Small molecules able to bind the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and disrupt the binding to ACE2 would offer an important tool for slowing, or even preventing, the infection. Here, we screened 2421 approved small molecules in silico and validated the docking outcomes through extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Out of six drugs characterized as putative RBD binders, the cephalosporin antibiotic cefsulodin was further assessed for its effect on the binding between the RBD and ACE2, suggesting that it is important to consider the dynamic formation of the heterodimer between RBD and ACE2 when judging any potential candidate.","Deganutti, Giuseppe; Prischi, Filippo; Reynolds, Christopher A",J. comput. aided mol. des,,383

Due to the contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 and its suspected presence in middle ear mucosa and mastoid, Ear surgeons are bound to face a challenging situation in present times as well as in times to come. Through this article we aim to streamline fresh management strategies particularly for the post-lockdown period keeping in mind that immunity after vaccination may take a few months to develop due to various factors discussed in the article. The ENT Cochrane, Pubmed and Web of Science databases were searched extensively using the terms 'Covid-19 and SARS-CoV-2 in conjunction with Ear surgery and Otology. Data collected from these, put together with our experience helped us in putting forward fresh management strategies to deal with the current situation being experienced worldwide. To reduce the risk of infection to the healthcare staff, we have suggested a new triage strategy for ear surgeries to reduce the accumulated disease burden in the post-lockdown period until immunity by vaccination develops amongst a good number of Ear surgeons. Also we have put forward certain operating guidelines that might prove helpful for the Ear surgeon during these times. Fresh Triage guidelines mentioned in this article are particularly meant to help ear surgeons reduce the accumulated disease burden in the post lockdown-period with ease and efficacy.

To date, there are no data in the literature on the comorbid dermatologic diseases and COVID-19. We tried to analyze the previous dermatological comorbidity of 93 patients with COVID-19 (51 males, 42 females) who presented to the dermatology outpatient clinics for the last 3 years. The most common dermatologic diseases in patients with COVID-19 who have dermatologic diseases for the last 3 years were superficial fungal infections (24, 25.8%), seborrheic dermatitis (11, 11.8%), actinic keratosis (10, 10.8%), psoriasis (6, 6.5%), and eczema (6, 6.5%), respectively. In addition, the number of COVID-19 patients who presented to dermatology in the last 3 months was 17 (11 men, 6 women). The median age of these patients was 58 (minimum 18, maximum 80) years, and the most common dermatologic diseases before diagnosed COVID-19 were superficial fungal infections (5, 25%), psoriasis (4, 20%), and viral skin diseases (3, 15%).

316315,Experience of a Radiation Oncology Center Operating During the COVID-19 Outbreak,2020,"Numerous neutralizing antibodies that target SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and most directly block binding of the viral Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) to angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here, we deliberately exploit non-neutralizing RBD antibodies, showing they can dramatically assist in neutralization when linked to neutralizing binders. We identified antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) by phage display that bind RBD, but do not block ACE2 or neutralize virus as IgGs. When these non-neutralizing Fabs were assembled into bispecific VH/Fab IgGs with a neutralizing VH domain, we observed a ~ 25-fold potency improvement in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 compared to the mono-specific bi-valent VH-Fc alone or the cocktail of the VH-Fc and IgG. This effect was epitope-dependent, reflecting the unique geometry of the bispecific antibody toward Spike. Our results show that a bispecific antibody that combines both neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes on Spike-RBD is a promising and rapid engineering strategy to improve the potency of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Lim, Shion A; Gramespacher, Josef A; Pance, Katarina; Rettko, Nicholas J; Solomon, Paige; Jin, Jing; Lui, Irene; Elledge, Susanna K; Liu, Jia; Bracken, Colton J; Simmons, Graham; Zhou, Xin X; Leung, Kevin K; Wells, James A",MAbs,,383

INITIAL ASSESSMENT: 8.2 individuals per 1,000 inhabitants have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in our Province. The hospital predisposed 110 beds for COVID-19 patients: on the day of the local peak, 90% of them were occupied and intensive care unit (ICU) faced unprecedented admission rates, fearing system collapse. CHOICE OF SOLUTION: Instead of increasing the number of ICU beds, the creation of a step-down unit (SDU) close to the ICU was preferred: the aim was to safely improve the transfer of patients and to relieve ICU from the risk of overload. IMPLEMENTATION: A 9-bed SDU was created next to the ICU, led by intensivists and ICU nurses, with adequate personal protective equipment, monitoring systems and ventilators for respiratory support when needed. A second 6-bed SDU was also created. EVALUATION: Patients were clinically comparable to those of most reports from Western Countries now available in the literature. ICU never needed supernumerary beds, no patient died in the SDU, there was no waiting time for ICU admission of critical patients. SDU has been affordable from human resources, safety, and economic points of view. LESSONS LEARNED: COVID-19 is like an enduring Mass-Casualty Incident. Solutions tailored on local epidemiology and available resources should be implemented to preserve efficiency and adaptability of our institutions and provide adequate sanitary response.","Agnoletti, Vanni; Russo, Emanuele; Circelli, Alessandro; Benni, Marco; Bolondi, Giuliano; Martino, Costanza; Santonastaso, Domenico P; Brogi, Etrusca; Praticò, Beniamino; Coccolini, Federico; Fugazzola, Paola; Ansaloni, Luca; Gamberini, Emiliano",Int. j. qual. health care,,383
317570,Iatrogenic immunosuppression can lead to prolonged viral shedding and absent immune response to COVID-19,2021,"We study real-time routing policies in smart transit systems, where the platform has a combination of cars and high-capacity vehicles (e.g., buses or shuttles) and seeks to serve a set of incoming trip requests. The platform can use its fleet of cars as a feeder to connect passengers to its high-capacity fleet, which operates on fixed routes. Our goal is to find the optimal set of (bus) routes and corresponding frequencies to maximize the social welfare of the system in a given time window. This generalizes the Line Planning Problem, a widely studied topic in the transportation literature, for which existing solutions are either heuristic (with no performance guarantees), or require extensive computation time (and hence are impractical for real-time use). To this end, we develop a $1-\frac{1}{e}-\varepsilon$ approximation algorithm for the Real-Time Line Planning Problem, using ideas from randomized rounding and the Generalized Assignment Problem. Our guarantee holds under two assumptions: $(i)$ no inter-bus transfers and $(ii)$ access to a pre-specified set of feasible bus lines. We moreover show that these two assumptions are crucial by proving that, if either assumption is relaxed, the Real-Time Line Planning Problem does not admit any constant-factor approximation. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm via numerical experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets, in which we show that, given a fixed time budget, our algorithm outperforms Integer Linear Programming-based exact methods.","Banerjee, Siddhartha; Hssaine, Chamsi; P'erivier, No'emie; Samaranayake, Samitha",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06212v2.pdf,383

While most loops had essentially one stable conformation, 17 of 44 loop regions were observed to be structurally variable with multiple substantively distinct conformations based on a cluster analysis. Loop modeling methods were then applied to the S protein loop targets, and the prediction accuracies discussed in relation to the characteristics of the conformational clusters identified. Loops with multiple conformations were found to be challenging to model based on a single structural template.","Wong, Samuel W.K.; Liu, Zongjun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08835v2.pdf,383

We find evidence of a midlife nadir or zenith in Scotland in well-being at around age fifty using a variety of measures of both happiness and unhappiness. We confirm that higher consumption of fruit and vegetables is associated with higher levels of happiness in Scotland. We compare this with evidence for England from the Health Survey of England. The decline in well-being between youth and midlife is comparable in size to the loss of a spouse or of a job and around half of the fall in well-being in the COVID-19 lockdown. We also find a mid-life peak in suicides in Scotland. Despite higher mortality and suicide rates in Scotland than in England, paradoxically we find that the Scots are happier than the English. Northern Ireland is the happiest of the four home countries. We also find evidence of U-shapes in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the mid to late forties.","Bell, David N.

319938,Recent COVID-19 vaccination is associated with modest increases in the physiological demands to graded exercise,2021,"AIMS: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, incidence of hip fracture has not changed. Evidence has shown increased mortality rates associated with COVID-19 infection. However, little is known about the outcomes of COVID-19 negative patients in a pandemic environment. In addition, the impact of vitamin D levels on mortality in COVID-19 hip fracture patients has yet to be determined. METHODS: This multicentre observational study included 1,633 patients who sustained a hip fracture across nine hospital trusts in North West England. Data were collected for three months from March 2020 and for the same period in 2019. Patients were matched by Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS), hospital, and fracture type. We looked at the mortality outcomes of COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients sustaining a hip fracture. We also looked to see if Vitamin D levels had an impact on mortality. RESULTS: The demographics of the 2019 and 2020 groups were similar, with a slight increase in proportion of male patients in the 2020 group. The 30-day mortality was 35.6% in COVID-19 positive patients and 7.8% in the COVID-19 negative patients. There was a potential association of decreasing vitamin D levels and increasing mortality rates for COVID-19 positive patients although our findings did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: In 2020 there was a significant increase in 30-day mortality rates of patients who were COVID-19 positive but not of patients who were COVID-19 negative. Low levels of vitamin D may be associated with high mortality rates in COVID-19 positive patients.","Mahmood, Aatif; Rashid, Fatima; Limb, Richard; Cash, Thomas; Nagy, Mathias Thomas; Zreik, Nasri; Reddy, Gautam; Jaly, Ibrahim; As-Sultany, Mohammed; Chan, Yuen Ting Carol; Wilson, Graeme; Harrison, W J",Bone Joint J,,383

Hence, this work investigated how family-to-work, work-to-family conflicts, and emotional intelligence influenced the four dimensions of job burnout (enthusiasm towards the job, psychological exhaustion, indolence, and guilt) among teachers administering children with disabilities. This was assessed using a cross-sectional online survey design of 276 special education teachers (female = 159;mean age = 32.5, SD = 10.1) from the Nigerian population of teachers. Data were collected using structured psychological tests, including the Work and Family Conflict Scale (WFCS), Emotional Intelligence Scale, and Job Burnout Scale. Results indicated that emotional intelligence predicted all the dimensions of job burnout in teachers except psychological exhaustion. The independent variables failed to predict psychological exhaustion;however, family-to-work conflict independently predicted indolence. Furthermore, the results revealed no gender difference in all four dimensions of job burnout. Based on these findings, it was recommended that an intervention strategy targeting the promotion of emotional intelligence and adequate provision of modern facilities to be used to assist teachers in their special skills delivery. © 2020 Olatunji et al.;Licensee Lifescience Global.

321145,Should patients with obesity be more afraid of COVID-19?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Benefits of a diverse physician workforce are numerous and the impact of a lack of diversity has been highlighted with the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the commitment of professional societies such as the American College of Radiology to diversity in Radiology, the field and its residency training programs remain the least diverse. With COVID-19 related suspension of in-person medical student rotations, our Department of Radiology redesigned and implemented a virtual radiology internship for underrepresented minority (URM) medical students. METHODS: A four-week virtual radiology internship was designed to provide clinical exposure to radiology and to allow students to gain an understanding of what a career in radiology entails. Course design included videoconference patient care sessions, didactic lectures, online modules, mentoring, and extra-clinical curriculum. Feedback from students was collected using online surveys assessing pre- and postcourse attitudes and understanding of a career in radiology and the students' perceived aptitude for such a career, as well as course component evaluation. RESULTS: Three participants were enrolled in the inaugural clerkship. All noted exceptional educational course content and ample opportunities to build connections with faculty and residents-with mentoring seen as the highlight of the course. All indicated a significant shift in perception of the field and in declaring interest in pursuing a career in radiology. CONCLUSION: Virtual radiology internship for URM students is a feasible paradigm to address potential impediments to diversification of the specialty by both engaging interested URM medical students in a career in radiology and arming them with the tools for a successful application to radiology residency.","Dodelzon, Katerina; Belfi, Lily; Schweitzer, Andrew D; Lamparello, Nicole; Legasto, Alan C; McGinty, Geraldine; Spottswood, Stephanie; Min, Robert J; Babagbemi, Kemi",Acad. radiol,,383

323149,Transitioning a Surgery Practice to Telehealth During COVID-19,2020,"Background The initial global outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic, which is responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), shares similarities with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and behaves similarly to influenza with a high intranasal viral load. The genome sequence of COVID-19 opened the opportunity for multiple in vitro and clinical trials, but we still do not have a clear path to treatment. Chlorpheniramine maleate (CPM) is a safe and effective antihistamine with potent antiviral activity against various strains of influenza A/B, thus suggesting that CPM has broad antiviral activity. We tested the virucidal potential of CPM in a nasal spray composition currently in development as an anti-allergy medication. Methods The virucidal activity of CPM was tested using viral stock of SARS-CoV-2, USA-WA1/2020 strain in Vero 76 infected cells. The endpoint titer 50% cell culture infection dose (CCID50) values were calculated using the Reed-Muench (1948) equation. Three independent replicates of each sample were tested, and the average and standard deviation were calculated. Results were compared with untreated controls using one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) with Dunnett's multiple comparison test in GraphPad Prism (version 8) software. Results After 25 minutes of contact time, the nasal spray reduced the levels of the virus from 4.2 to 1.7 log10 CCID50 per 0.1 mL, a statistically significant 2.5 log reduction value or 99.7% reduction in the viral load. Conclusions This study demonstrates the strong virucidal effect against SARS-CoV-2 of a nasal spray containing CPM.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) system is not uniformly expressed in all of the human races, and current differences could explain some of the geographical discrepancies in infection around the world. Furthermore, animal studies have shown that the ACE2 receptor is a potential pathway for host infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. As two-thirds of hypertensive patients take ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, several concerns have been raised about the detrimental role of current antihypertensive drugs in COVID-19. This report summarizes the recent evidence for and against the administration of ACE blockade in the COVID-19 era.","Ruocco, G.; Feola, M.; Palazzuoli, A.",International Journal of Infectious Diseases,,383

Prognostic factors of critically ill patients with COVID-19 have not been fully elucidated yet. Methods: In the present study, 59 patients with COVID-19 from the intensive care unit of the Caidian Branch of Tongji Hospital were enrolled. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data, and clinical outcomes were collected. Prognostic factors were statistically defined. Results: Of the 59 patients studied (67.4±11.3 years), 38 patients were male, 51 had underlying diseases, and 41 patients died during admission. Compared with the survivors, the deceased patients were of older age, had more smoking history, severer fatigue, and diarrhea, a higher incidence of multiple organ injuries, more deteriorative lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, remarkably impaired cellular immune response, and strengthened cytokine release. Age higher than 70 (OR=2.76, 95% CI=1.45-5.23), arrhythmia (OR=4.76, 95% CI=1.59-14.25), and a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score above 4 (OR=5.16, 95% CI=1.29-20.55) were identified as risk factors for mortality of patients. Conclusion: Critically ill COVID-19 patients aged higher than 70, arrhythmia, or a SOFA score above 4 have a high risk of mortality, and need prior medical intervention.","Wang, Zhao-Hua; Shu, Chang; Ran, Xiao; Xie, Cui-Hong; Zhang, Lei",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,,383

The virus's blend of lethality and transmissibility have challenged officials and exposed critical limitations of the traditional public health apparatus. However, throughout this pandemic, technology has answered the call for a new form of public health that illustrates opportunities for enhanced agility, scale, and responsiveness. The authors share the Microsoft perspective and illustrate how technology has helped transform the public health landscape with new and refined capabilities - the efficacy and impact of which will be determined by history. Technologies like chatbot and virtualized patient care offer a mechanism to triage and distribute care at scale. Artificial intelligence and high-performance computing have accelerated research into understanding the virus and developing targeted therapeutics to treat infection and prevent transmission. New mobile contact tracing protocols that preserve patient privacy and civil liberties were developed in response to public concerns, creating new opportunities for privacy-sensitive technologies that aid efforts to prevent and control outbreaks. While much progress is still needed, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted technology's importance to public health security and pandemic preparedness. Future multi-stakeholder collaborations, including those with technology organizations, are needed to facilitate progress in overcoming the current pandemic, setting the stage for improved pandemic preparedness in the future. As lessons are assessed from the current pandemic, public officials should consider technology's role and continue to seek opportunities to supplement and improve on traditional approaches.","Uohara, Michael Y; Weinstein, James N; Rhew, David C",Popul Health Manag,,383

325645,Indirect consequences of COVID-19 on children's health,2021,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2). Widespread testing is hampered by lack of test kits and their questionable accuracies. Applying deep learning algorithms on chest x-ray images is a better, more accurate and faster method of testing. People using conventional testing methods take a few hours to get back their test results, which sometimes increase depending on the backlog of the site as well as location. This paper introduces a novel deep learning algorithm which can predict the presence of the virus to very high degrees of accuracy. This paper gives an accuracy of about 98% on the test set. This results in quick detection of the infection and saves a lot of time between testing and diagnosis. This can be highly instrumental in saving the life of a person who displayed no signs of the virus, as well as preventing further spread of the virus. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Mishra, S.","1st International Conference on Machine Learning, Internet of Things and Big Data, ICMIB 2020",,383

SARS-CoV-2 disease COVID-19 has quickly spread worldwide, posing a serious threat to health and the economy. As of 25th January 2021, more than 100 million confirmed cases of 2,165,581 deaths have been reported by WHO and Worldometer. Many of the cases reported are caused by infection from human to human and are the carriers of this lethal coronavirus. Due to its calamitous nature, the whole world was under lockdown restricting all sorts of movements and means of transportation in hampering the countries economic balance. Presently, the world's endeavor to create and develop a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is bearing the fruit. A handful of vaccines now have been authorized around the globe and many more remain in the development phase. In addition, social isolation and knowledge of hygiene (facial masks and sanitizers) are potential methods of controlling the further dissemination of global pandemics COVID-19. This research article presents a brief overview of the catastrophic effect caused by COVID-19 disease globally and particularly in different states of India. Additionally, the article also discusses the recent variant of SARS-CoV-2 and its vulnerable impact. Furthermore, the article investigates the currently available vaccines and those in their development phase for the treatment of COVID-19 disease.

The objective of this study was to examine the survival effect of delay in starting concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) in women with locally-advanced cervical cancer. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study querying the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2016. Women with stage IB2-IVA squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix who received definitive CCRT with known wait-time for CCRT initiation after cancer diagnosis were eligible (N=13,617). Cox proportional hazard regression model with restricted cubic spline transformation was fitted to assess the association between CCRT wait-time and all-cause mortality in multivariable analysis. RESULTS: The median wait-time to start CCRT was 6 (IQR 4-8) weeks. In a multivariable analysis, older age, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic ethnicity, recent year of diagnosis, Medicaid and uninsured status, medical comorbidities, and absence of nodal metastasis were associated with longer CCRT wait-time (P<.05). Women with aggressive tumor factors (poorer differentiation, large tumor size, nodal metastasis, and higher cancer stage) were more likely to have a short CCRT wait-time (P<.05). After controlling for the measured covariates, CCRT wait-time of 6.1-9.8 weeks was not associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to a wait-time of 6 weeks. Similar association was observed when the cohort was stratified by histology, cancer stage, tumor size, or brachytherapy use. CONCLUSION: An implication of this study for the current coronavirus pandemic is that in the absence of aggressive tumor factors, a short period of wait-time to start definitive CCRT may not be associated with increased risk of mortality in women with locally-advanced cervical cancer.","Matsuo, Koji; Huang, Yongmei; Matsuzaki, Shinya; Ragab, Omar M; Roman, Lynda D; Wright, Jason D",Gynecol Oncol,,383

One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 5000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identified by board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2000 radiograms was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 3000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98% ( ± 3%), while having a specificity rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain most of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates. The dataset, model implementations (in PyTorch), and evaluations, are all made publicly available for research community at https://github.com/shervinmin/DeepCovid.git.","Minaee, Shervin; Kafieh, Rahele; Sonka, Milan; Yazdani, Shakib; Jamalipour Soufi, Ghazaleh",Med Image Anal,,383

Thus, we sought to examine whether increased inflammatory response to stress among patients with CHD is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular events and whether this risk is higher in women. We examined inflammatory biomarkers known to increase with mental stress (speech task), including interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) among 562 patients with stable CHD. Inflammatory response, the difference between post-stress and resting values, was examined as a predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) using subdistribution hazards models for competing risks adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and medications. MACE was defined as a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina with revascularization, and heart failure. All biomarkers were standardized. The mean age was 63 years (range 34-79) and 24% were women. During a median follow-up of 3 years, 71 patients experienced MACE. Overall, there was no significant association between inflammatory response to stress and risk of MACE, but there were sex-based interactions for IL-6 (p = 0.001) and MCP-1 (p = 0.008). The risk of MACE increased 56% (HR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.21, 2.01; p = 0.001) and 30% (HR: 1.30; 95% 1.09. 1.55; p = 0.004) for each standard deviation increase in IL-6 and MCP-1 response to mental stress for women, respectively, while there was no association among men.

Public Health England (PHE) provided guidance to manage the spread of the virus. In response to the national lockdown, the Forensic Healthcare Service part of Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SPFT) took measures that were considered necessary to prevent the risk of spread to patients and staff.Restrictions necessary to contain the virus included immediate suspension of all patients leave except emergency leave, suspension of visits by family members and professionals including legal visits and restrictions on multidisciplinary (MDT) members physically present on the wards. It was necessary to adapt our existing model of care to reflect and represent the challenges faced by such restrictions.A service evaluation project was undertaken to ascertain the patients' and carers’ perspectives of the management of restrictions.MethodStandardsIt is noteworthy that no service standards in the context of this unique global pandemic were available internationally, nationally or regionally at the time of undertaking the project.Methodology / Data collectionAn anonymous patient feedback questionnaire was developed to collect data on voluntary basis from all the inpatients within the secure and forensic CDS. Patients' feedback was broadly divided in to three sections 1) personal factors, 2) satisfaction with access to information and 3) satisfaction with services to include mental and physical well-being.Patients' feedback was collected during a 6-week period. For observation purposes, risk comparison anonymous data were also collected. Informal Carers' feedback was collected with regard to virtual visits.ResultDuring the data collection period 99 out of 105 beds were occupied. The response rate was 49% (49 responders).Overall 73% of responders expressed that their mental health was affected. Approximately 51% of responders expressed that progress towards their discharge was very much affected. 91% of responders were not coping well with the new circumstancesOverall, carers' feedback was positive in regard to provision of virtual visits.ConclusionOur survey has shown that the necessary COVID-19 pandemic restrictions have in some domains resulted in a negative impact on patients’ mental wellbeing and progression.

Little is known about the efficacy of PR in these patients. We therefore compared post-COVID-19 patients (PG) referred to PR patients with other lung diseases (LG). METHODS: 99 PG were admitted to PR. In a prospective design, the results of PG were collected and compared to the results of LG of 2019 (n = 419) according to Functional Independence Measurement (FIM), Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS), 6-min walk test (6-MWT), duration of PR, and Feeling Thermometer (FT). RESULTS: According to age, sex, and CIRS, both groups showed no significant differences. The improvements in the 6-MWT in the pre to post comparison were on average 180 (±101) meters for PG and 102 (±89) meters for LG (p < 0.001). FT showed a significant enhancement for PG of 21 (±14) points and for LG of 17 (±16) points (p < 0.039), while FIM significantly increased by 11 (±10) points in PG and 7 (±8) points in LG (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive PR in PG is very effective according to the results in FIM, 6-MWT and FT.

This method was used to evaluate the complete memory effects within the model. The Caputo-Fabrizio (CF) and Atangana-Baleanu models were used predicatively, to demonstrate the possible long-term trajectories of COVID-19. Thus, the expression of the basic reproduction number using the next generating matrix was derived. We also investigated the local stability of the equilibrium points. Additionally, we examined the existence and uniqueness of the solution for both extensions of these models. Comparisons of these two epidemic modeling approaches (i.e. CF and ABC fractional derivative) illustrated that, for non-integer &#964; value. The ABC approach had a significant effect on the dynamics of the epidemic and provided new perspective for its utilization as a tool to advance research in disease transmission dynamics for critical COVID-19 cases. Concurrently, the CF approach demonstrated promise for use in mild cases. Furthermore, the integer &#964; value results of both approaches were identical.","Panwar, Virender Singh; Sheik Uduman, P S; Gómez-Aguilar, J F",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,383

334847,The effects of fasting in Ramadan on the risk factors of COVID-19 in adolescents: a brief review,2021,"BACKGROUND: The word 'pandemic' conjures dystopian images of bodies stacked in the streets and societies on the brink of collapse. Despite this frightening picture, denialism and noncompliance with public health measures are common in the historical record, for example during the 1918 Influenza pandemic or the 2015 Ebola epidemic. The unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-its high basic reproduction number (R0), time-limited natural immunity and considerable potential for asymptomatic spread-exacerbate the public health repercussions of noncompliance with interventions (such as vaccines and masks) to limit disease transmission. Our work explores the rationality and impact of noncompliance with measures aimed at limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this work, we used game theory to explore when noncompliance confers a perceived benefit to individuals. We then used epidemiological modeling to predict the impact of noncompliance on control of SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that the presence of a noncompliant subpopulation prevents suppression of disease spread. RESULTS: Our modeling demonstrates that noncompliance is a Nash equilibrium under a broad set of conditions and that the existence of a noncompliant population can result in extensive endemic disease in the long-term after a return to pre-pandemic social and economic activity. Endemic disease poses a threat for both compliant and noncompliant individuals; all community members are protected if complete suppression is achieved, which is only possible with a high degree of compliance. For interventions that are highly effective at preventing disease spread, however, the consequences of noncompliance are borne disproportionately by noncompliant individuals. CONCLUSIONS: In sum, our work demonstrates the limits of free-market approaches to compliance with disease control measures during a pandemic. The act of noncompliance with disease intervention measures creates a negative externality, rendering suppression of SARS-CoV-2 spread ineffective. Our work underscores the importance of developing effective strategies for prophylaxis through public health measures aimed at complete suppression and the need to focus on compliance at a population level.","Stoddard, Madison; Van Egeren, Debra; Johnson, Kaitlyn E; Rao, Smriti; Furgeson, Josh; White, Douglas E; Nolan, Ryan P; Hochberg, Natasha; Chakravarty, Arijit",BMC Public Health,,383

This global health crisis imposes limitations on daily movements, which have deteriorated every sector in our society. Understanding public reactions to the virus and the non-pharmaceutical interventions should be of great help to fight COVID-19 in a strategic way. We aim to provide tangible evidence of the human mobility trends by comparing the day-by-day variations across the U.S. Large-scale public mobility at an aggregated level is observed by leveraging mobile device location data and the measures related to social distancing. Our study captures spatial and temporal heterogeneity as well as the sociodemographic variations regarding the pandemic propagation and the non-pharmaceutical interventions. All mobility metrics adapted capture decreased public movements after the national emergency declaration. The population staying home has increased in all states and becomes more stable after the stay-at-home order with a smaller range of fluctuation. There exists overall mobility heterogeneity between the income or population density groups. The public had been taking active responses, voluntarily staying home more, to the in-state confirmed cases while the stay-at-home orders stabilize the variations. The study suggests that the public mobility trends conform with the government message urging to stay home. We anticipate our data-driven analysis offers integrated perspectives and serves as evidence to raise public awareness and, consequently, reinforce the importance of social distancing while assisting policymakers.","Lee, Minha; Zhao, Jun; Sun, Qianqian; Pan, Yixuan; Zhou, Weiyi; Xiong, Chenfeng; Zhang, Lei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01215v2.pdf,383

337717,Interventional Stroke Care in the Era of COVID-19,2020,"Importance: Evidence suggests that physicians experience high levels of burnout and stress and that trainee physicians are a particularly high-risk group. Multiple workplace- and non-workplace-related factors have been identified in trainee physicians, but it is unclear which factors are most important in association with burnout and stress. Better understanding of the most critical factors could help inform the development of targeted interventions to reduce burnout and stress. Objective: To estimate the association between different stressors and burnout/stress among physicians engaged in standard postgraduate training (ie, trainee physicians). Data Sources: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews from inception until April 30, 2019. Search terms included trainee, foundation year, registrar, resident, and intern. Study Selection: Studies that reported associations between stressors and burnout/stress in trainee physicians. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality of the evidence. The main meta-analysis was followed by sensitivity analyses. All analyses were performed using random-effects models, and heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic. Main Outcome and Measures: The main outcome was the association between burnout/stress and workplace- or non-workplace-related factors reported as odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs. Results: Forty-eight studies were included in the meta-analysis (n = 36 266, median age, 29 years [range, 24.6-35.7 years]). One study did not specify participants' sex; of the total population, 18â¯781 participants (52%) were men. In particular, work demands of a trainee physician were associated with a nearly 3-fold increased odds for burnout/stress (OR, 2.84; 95% CI, 2.26-3.59), followed by concerns about patient care (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.58-3.50), poor work environment (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.57-2.70), and poor work-life balance (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.53-2.44). Perceived/reported poor mental or physical health (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.76-3.31), female sex (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.20-1.50), financial worries (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.07-1.72), and low self-efficacy (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.31-3.46) were associated with increased odds for burnout/stress, whereas younger age and a more junior grade were not significantly associated. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that the odds ratios for burnout and stress in trainee physicians are higher than those for work-related factors compared with nonmodifiable and non-work-related factors, such as age and grade. These findings support the need for organizational interventions to mitigate burnout in trainee physicians.","Zhou, Anli Yue; Panagioti, Maria; Esmail, Aneez; Agius, Raymond; Van Tongeren, Martie; Bower, Peter",JAMA Netw Open,,383

Coordinated preparation plans and strategies between the university and hospitals were needed to safely resume clinical placements within national and hospitals' risk control measures against COVID-19 transmission. METHODS: Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and the Radiology Department of Singapore General Hospital (SGH) had collaborated to meet requirements for safe resumption of clinical placements. SIT prepared students by emphasising compliance to all risk measures, addressing concerns of risk transmission, meeting learning objectives, and reassessing infection control competencies. In tandem, SGH prepared an orientation programme and used technology for open communication among faculty, clinical educators and students which included monitoring of well-being and rapid dissemination of updates. Of note, SGH reorganised operating procedures and physical spaces to meet national standards of safe physical distancing, restricted movement between treatment areas and teams, and rosters to remain committed to the supervision and education of students. RESULTS: Clinical placements resumed 3 months following suspension. Clinical educators faced the challenge of the need for balance between increasing clinical load and student supervision. A solution was frequent engagement and support by faculty, with educators and students via video conferencing platforms. Students' well-being was frequently checked. There was less variation in cases which simulation training made up for some of the learning objectives. CONCLUSION: Adaptation and commitment to continue active and quality clinical education while ensuring students' safety were vital during a pandemic.

339272,Better Anticoagulated Than Not! Hypercoagulability in COVID-19,2021,"Congestive heart failure (CHF) is often associated with kidney and pulmonary dysfunction. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) contributes to avid sodium retention, cardiac hypertrophy and oedema formation, including lung congestion. While the status of the classic components of RAAS such as renin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensin II receptor AT-1 is well studied in CHF, the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a key enzyme of angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) generation in the pulmonary, cardiac and renal systems has not been studied thoroughly in this clinical setting. This issue is of a special interest as Ang 1-7 counterbalance the vasoconstrictory, pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative actions of Ang II. Furthermore, CHF predisposes to COVID-19 disease severity, while ACE2 also serves as the binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 in human host-cells, and acts in concert with furin, an important enzyme in the synthesis of BNP in CHF, in permeating viral functionality along TMPRSST2. ADAM17 governs ACE2 shedding from cell membranes. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the expression of ACE2, furin, TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 in the lung, heart and kidneys of rats with CHF to understand the exaggerated susceptibility of clinical CHF to COVID-19 disease. Heart failure was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by the creation of a surgical aorto-caval fistula. Sham-operated rats served as controls. One week after surgery, the animals were subdivided into compensated and decompensated CHF according to urinary sodium excretion. Both groups and their controls were sacrificed, and their hearts, lungs and kidneys were harvested for assessment of tissue remodelling and ACE2, furin, TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 immunoreactivity, expression and immunohistochemical staining. ACE2 immunoreactivity and mRNA levels increased in pulmonary, cardiac and renal tissues of compensated, but not in decompensated CHF. Furin immunoreactivity was increased in both compensated and decompensated CHF in the pulmonary, cardiac tissues and renal cortex but not in the medulla. Interestingly, both the expression and abundance of pulmonary, cardiac and renal TMPRSS2 decreased in CHF in correlation with the severity of the disease. Pulmonary, cardiac and renal ADAM17 mRNA levels were also downregulated in decompensated CHF. Circulating furin levels increased in proportion to CHF severity, whereas plasma ACE2 remained unchanged. In summary, ACE2 and furin are overexpressed in the pulmonary, cardiac and renal tissues of compensated and to a lesser extent of decompensated CHF as compared with their sham controls. The increased expression of the ACE2 in heart failure may serve as a compensatory mechanism, counterbalancing the over-activity of the deleterious isoform, ACE. Downregulated ADAM17 might enhance membranal ACE2 in COVID-19 disease, whereas the suppression of TMPRSS2 in CHF argues against its involvement in the exaggerated susceptibility of CHF patients to SARS-CoV2.","Khoury, Emad E; Knaney, Yara; Fokra, Ahmad; Kinaneh, Safa; Azzam, Zaher; Heyman, Samuel N; Abassi, Zaid",J Cell Mol Med,,383

The urgent need to control the disease, combined with the lack of specific and effective treatment modalities, call for the use of FDA-approved agents that have shown efficacy against similar pathogens. Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir or ribavirin have all been successful in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The initial results of a number of clinical trials involving various protocols of administration of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine mostly point towards their beneficial effect. However, they may not be effective in cases with persistently high viremia, while results on ivermectin (another antiparasitic agent) are not yet available. Interestingly, azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic in combination with hydroxychloroquine, might yield clinical benefit as an adjunctive. The results of clinical trials point to the potential clinical efficacy of antivirals, especially remdesivir (GS-5734), lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir. Other therapeutic options that are being explored involve meplazumab, tocilizumab, and interferon type 1. We discuss a number of other drugs that are currently in clinical trials, whose results are not yet available, and in various instances we enrich such efficacy analysis by invoking historic data on the treatment of SARS, MERS, influenza, or in vitro studies. Meanwhile, scientists worldwide are seeking to discover novel drugs that take advantage of the molecular structure of the virus, its intracellular life cycle that probably elucidates unfolded-protein response, as well as its mechanism of surface binding and cell invasion, like angiotensin converting enzymes-, HR1, and metalloproteinase inhibitors.","Drozdzal, Sylwester; Rosik, Jakub; Lechowicz, Kacper; Machaj, Filip; Kotfis, Katarzyna; Ghavami, Saeid; Los, Marek J",Drug Resist Updat,,383

We describe the epidemiological and laboratory data from one of the first such outbreaks in Ontario to assess factors associated with its severity, and the impact of progressive interventions for infection control over the course of the outbreak. METHODS: We obtained line list and outbreak data from the public health unit to describe resident and staff cases, severity and distribution of cases over time and within the outbreak facility. Where available, we obtained data on laboratory specimens from the Public Health Ontario Laboratory and performed whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of viral specimens from the outbreak. RESULTS: Among 65 residents of the long-term care home, 61 (94%) contracted SARS-CoV-2, with a case fatality rate of 45% (28/61). Among 67 initial staff, 34 (51%) contracted the virus and none died. When the outbreak was declared, 12 staff, 2 visitors and 9 residents had symptoms. Resident cases were located in 3 of 4 areas of the home. Phylogenetic analysis showed tight clustering of cases, with only 1 additional strain of genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 identified from a staff case in the third week of the outbreak. No cases were identified among 26 new staff brought into the home after full outbreak measures were implemented. INTERPRETATION: Rapid and undetected viral spread in a long-term care home led to high rates of infection among residents and staff.

The virus has already killed more than 2.3 million people worldwide. OBJECT: The principal intent of this work was to investigate lead compounds by screening natural product library (NPASS) for possible treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Pharmacophore features were used to screen a large database to get a small dataset for structure-based virtual screening of natural product compounds. In the structure-based screening, molecular docking was performed to find a potent inhibitor molecule against the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6Y7M). The predicted lead compound was further subjected to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to check the stability of the leads compound with the evolution of time. RESULTS: In pharmacophore-based virtual screening, 2,361 compounds were retained out of 30,927. In the structure-based screening, the lead compounds were filtered based on their docking scores. Among the 2,360 compounds, 12 lead compounds were selected based on their docking score. Kazinol T with NPASS ID: NPC474104 showed the highest docking score of -14.355 and passed criteria of Lipinski's drug-like parameters. Monitoring ADMET properties, Kazinol T showed its safety for consumption. Docking of Kazinol T with two Asian mutants (R60C and I152V) showed variations in binding and energy parameters. Normal mode analysis for ligand-bound and unbound form of protease along with its mutants, revealed displacement and correlation parameters for C-alpha atoms. MD simulation results showed that all ligand-protein complexes remained intact and stable in a dynamic environment with negative Gibbs free energy. CONCLUSIONS: The natural product Kazinol T was a predicted lead compound against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and will be the possible treatment for COVID-19.","Muhammad, Ijaz; Rahman, Noor; Niaz, Sadaf; Basharat, Zarrin; Rastrelli, Luca; Jayanthi, Sivaraman; Efferth, Thomas; Khan, Haroon",Comput Biol Med,,383

However, considering the clinical complications of COVID-19 in different organs, there is no strong association between the abundance of ACE2/TMPRSS2 co-expression and clinical features of the disease and the severity of complications. Since SARS-CoV-2 affects certain organs that lack or have low expression of ACE2/TMPRSS2, it may be possible that the virus employs other receptors for colonization and entry. Based on recent studies, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) can be a potential alternative receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. In this letter, supporting evidence proposed GRP78 as an alternative receptor in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Shahriari Felordi, M.; Memarnejadian, A.; Najimi, M.; Vosough, M.",Cell Journal,,383

We aimed to investigate the compliance of children aged 4 to 12 years with the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and evaluate the impact of school closure on the children’s educational, social, economic, and psychological outcomes. An online survey was distributed through a social networking platform to parents of pre-primary and primary school-age children. The study period was defined as from 27 November 2020 to 3 December 2020, two weeks after the school closure due to the general lockdown in Greece. This study showed that the school units were well-informed and complied with the protection measures against COVID-19. The pupils quickly adopted the protection measures, even those whose parents suggested masks were less effective. The quarantine-forced school closure highly impacted primary school children’s physical activity, quality of sleep, psychological status, eating habits, academic performance, and household income. Web use showed an increase, with the children over-spending extracurricular time in web activities.

341466,Psychological and Behavioral Treatment of Female Orgasmic Disorder,2020,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has drastically disrupted the air cargo industry. This disruption has taken many directions, one of which is the demand imbalance which occurs due to the sudden change in the cargo capacity, as well as demand. Therefore, the random change leads to excessive demand in some routes (hot-selling routes), while some other routes suffer from a big shortage of demand (underutilized routes). Routes are substitutable when there are several adjacent airports in the Origin & Destination (O&D) market. In this market, demand imbalance between substitutable routes occurs because of the above reasons. To tackle the demand imbalance problem, a novel model is introduced to estimate the quantity combinations which maintains the balance between underutilized and hot-selling routes. This model is a variant of the classic Cournot model which captures different quantity scenarios in the form of the best response for each route compared to the other. We then cultivate the model by integrating the Puppet Cournot game with the quantity discount policy. The quantity discount policy is an incentive which motivates the freight forwarders to increase their orders in the underutilized routes. After conducting numerical experiments, the results reveal that the profit can increase up to 25% by using the quantity discount. However, the quantity discount model is only applicable when the profit increase in the hot-selling route is greater than the profit decrease in the underutilized route.","Shaban, Ibrahim Abdelfadeel Chan F.

342051,Women in COVID-19 pandemic: Influential leadership is the need of the hour,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the healthcare system in the United States. The redistribution of resources and suspension of elective procedures and other services has resulted in financial stress across all service lines. The financial effects on the practice of vascular surgery have not yet been quantified. We hypothesized that vascular surgery divisions have experienced losses affecting the hospital and professional sides that will not be recoupable without significant productivity increases. METHODS: Administrative claims data for clinical services performed by the vascular surgery division at a tertiary medical center for March and April 2019 and for March and April 2020 were analyzed. These claims were separated into two categories: hospital claims (inpatient and outpatient) and professional claims (professional reimbursement for all services provided). Medicare reimbursement methods were used to assign financial value: diagnosis-related group for inpatient services, ambulatory payment classification for outpatient services, and the Medicare physician fee schedule for professional reimbursement and work relative value units (wRVUs). Reimbursements and productivity (wRVUs) were compared between the two periods. A financial model was created to determine the increase in future productivity over baseline required to mitigate the losses incurred during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 11,317 vascular surgery claims were reviewed. Hospital reimbursement during the pandemic decreased from $4,982,114 to $2,649,521 (-47%) overall (inpatient, from $3,505,775 to $2,128,133 [-39%]; outpatient, from $1,476,339 to $521,388 [-65%]) and professional reimbursement decreased from $933,897 to $430,967 (-54%) compared with the same period in 2019. Professional productivity as measured by wRVUs sustained a similar decline from 10,478 wRVUs to 5386 wRVUs (-51%). Modeling sensitivity analyses demonstrated that if a vascular division were able to increase inpatient and outpatient revenue to greater than prepandemic levels by 10%, 5%, or 3%, it would take 9, 19, or 31 months, respectively, for the hospital to recover their pandemic-associated losses. Similarly, professional reimbursement recovery would require 11, 20, or 36 months with corresponding increases in productivity. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound and lasting effects on the world in terms of lives lost and financial hardships. The financial effects on vascular surgery divisions has resulted in losses ranging from 39% to 65% compared with the prepandemic period in the previous year. Because the complete mitigation of losses is not feasible in the short term, alternative and novel strategies are needed to financially sustain the vascular division and hospital during a prolonged recovery period.","Fang, Zachary B; Simons, Jessica P; Judelson, Dejah R; Arous, Edward J; Jones, Douglas W; Steppacher, Robert C; Schanzer, Andres; Aiello, Francesco A",J Vasc Surg,,383

To date there are few reports of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) caused by type 1 myocardial infarction in patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the demographic, angiographic, and procedural characteristics alongside clinical outcomes of consecutive cases of COVID-19-positive patients with STEMI compared with COVID-19-negative patients. METHODS: This was a single-center, observational study of 115 consecutive patients admitted with confirmed STEMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention at Barts Heart Centre between March 1, 2020, and May 20, 2020. RESULTS: Patients with STEMI presenting with concurrent COVID-19 infection had higher levels of troponin T and lower lymphocyte count, but elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein. There were significantly higher rates of multivessel thrombosis, stent thrombosis, higher modified thrombus grade post first device with consequently higher use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and thrombus aspiration. Myocardial blush grade and left ventricular function were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 with STEMI. Higher doses of heparin to achieve therapeutic activated clotting times were also noted. Importantly, patients with STEMI presenting with COVID-19 infection had a longer in-patient admission and higher rates of intensive care admission. CONCLUSIONS: In patients presenting with STEMI and concurrent COVID-19 infection, there is a strong signal toward higher thrombus burden and poorer outcomes. This supports the need for establishing COVID-19 status in all STEMI cases. Further work is required to understand the mechanism of increased thrombosis and the benefit of aggressive antithrombotic therapy in selected cases.","Choudry, Fizzah A; Hamshere, Stephen M; Rathod, Krishnaraj S; Akhtar, Mohammed M; Archbold, R Andrew; Guttmann, Oliver P; Woldman, Simon; Jain, Ajay K; Knight, Charles J; Baumbach, Andreas; Mathur, Anthony; Jones, Daniel A",J Am Coll Cardiol,,383
342204,The The risk of public mobility from hotspots of COVID-19 during travel restriction in Bangladesh,2020,"Pirfenidone (PFD), a pyridone compound, is well recognized as an antifibrotic agent tailored for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, PFD based clinical trial has also been launched for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To what extent this drug can perturb membrane ion currents remains largely unknown. Herein, the exposure to PFD was observed to depress the amplitude of hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) in combination with a considerable slowing in the activation time of the current in pituitary GH3 cells. In the continued presence of ivabradine or zatebradine, subsequent application of PFD decreased Ih amplitude further. The presence of PFD resulted in a leftward shift in Ih activation curve without changes in the gating charge. The addition of this compound also led to a reduction in area of voltage-dependent hysteresis evoked by long-lasting inverted triangular (downsloping and upsloping) ramp pulse. Neither the amplitude of M-type nor erg-mediated K+ current was altered by its presence. In whole-cell potential recordings, addition of PFD reduced the firing frequency, and this effect was accompanied by the depression in the amplitude of sag voltage elicited by hyperpolarizing current stimulus. Overall, this study highlights evidence that PFD is capable of perturbing specific ionic currents, revealing a potential additional impact on functional activities of different excitable cells.","Chang, Wei-Ting; Ragazzi, Eugenio; Liu, Ping-Yen; Wu, Sheng-Nan",Eur J Pharmacol,,383

Their purpose is to advise healthcare professionals on how to ethically allocate scarce medical resources. One challenging feature of the pandemic has been the large numbers of patients needing mechanical ventilatory support. Guidelines have paradigmatically focused on the question of what doctors should do if they have fewer ventilators than patients who need respiratory support: which patient should get the ventilator? There is, however, an important higher level allocation problem. Namely, how are we to ethically distribute newly obtained ventilators across hospitals: which hospital should get the ventilator(s)? In this paper, we identify a set of principles for allocating newly obtained ventilators across hospitals. We focus particularly on low and middle income countries, who frequently have limited pre-existing intensive care capacity, and have needed to source additional ventilators. We first provide some background. Second, we argue that the main population healthcare aim during the COVID-19 pandemic should be to save the most lives. Next, we assess a series of potential heuristics or principles that could be used to guide allocation: allocation to the most densely populated cities, random allocation, allocation based on the ratio of patients to ICU personnel, prioritisation in terms of intrahospital mortality, prioritisation of younger populations, and prioritisation in terms of population mortality. We conclude by providing a plausible ranking of the principles, while noting a number of epistemological challenges, in terms of how they best further the aim of increasing the probability of saving the most lives.","Palacios-González, César; Pugh, Jonathan; Wilkinson, Dominic; Savulescu, Julian",,,383

Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) signaling and its downstream target Galectin-3 (Gal-3) are known to mediate cardiovascular inflammation and might be involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 complications. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the potential beneficial effects of MR antagonism and Gal-3 inhibition on the inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Methods: HAECs were treated with recombinant SARS-COV2 Spike (S) protein. MR antagonists (namely spironolactone and eplerenone) or the Gal-3 inhibitor G3P-01 were supplemented before and after S protein challenge. HAECs supernatants were assessed by ELISA or Western blotting. Results: HAECs treated with recombinant S protein resulted in enhanced secretion of inflammatory molecules (interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-18, interleukin-27, and interferon-γ) as well as in the thrombosis marker plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1. This was prevented and reversed by both MR antagonists and G3P-01. Conclusions: These findings indicate that MR/Gal-3 pathway blockade could be a promising option to reduce endothelial inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jover, Eva Matilla Lara Garaikoetxea Mattie Fernández-Celis Amaya Muntendam Pieter Jaisser Frédéric Rossignol Patrick López-Andrés Natalia",Biomedicines,,383
343517,Temporal evolution of tomographic findings of pulmonary infection in COVID-19,2020,"This paper introduces new methods to analyze the changing progression of COVID-19 cases to deaths in different waves of the pandemic. First, an algorithmic approach partitions each country or state's COVID-19 time series into a first wave and subsequent period. Next, offsets between case and death time series are learned for each country via a normalized inner product. Combining these with additional calculations, we can determine which countries have most substantially reduced the mortality rate of COVID-19. Finally, our paper identifies similarities in the trajectories of cases and deaths for European countries and U.S. states. Our analysis refines the popular conception that the mortality rate has greatly decreased throughout Europe during its second wave of COVID-19; instead, we demonstrate substantial heterogeneity throughout Europe and the U.S. The Netherlands exhibited the largest reduction of mortality, a factor of 16, followed by Denmark, France, Belgium, and other Western European countries, greater than both Eastern European countries and U.S. states. Some structural similarity is observed between Europe and the United States, in which Northeastern states have been the most successful in the country. Such analysis may help European countries learn from each other's experiences and differing successes to develop the best policies to combat COVID-19 as a collective unit.","James, Nick; Menzies, Max; Radchenko, Peter",Chaos,,383

During the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme demand for traditional lateral flow tests has stressed manufacturing capacity and supply chains. Motivated by this limitation, we developed a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test using cellulose, an alternative membrane material, and a double-antigen sandwich format. Functionalized SARS-CoV-2 antigens were used as both capture and reporter binders, replacing the anti-human antibodies currently used in lateral flow tests. The test could provide enhanced sensitivity because it labels only antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the signal intensity is not diminished due to other human antibodies in serum. Three-dimensional channels in the assay were designed to have consistent flow rates and be easily manufactured by folding wax-printed paper. We demonstrated that this simple, vertical flow, cellulose-based assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in clinical samples within 15 min, and the results were consistent with those from a laboratory, bead-based chemiluminescence immunoassay that was granted emergency use approval by the US FDA.","Kim, Seunghyeon; Hao, Yining; Miller, Eric A; Tay, Dousabel M Y; Yee, Emma; Kongsuphol, Patthara; Jia, Huan; McBee, Megan; Preiser, Peter R; Sikes, Hadley D",ACS Sens,,383

Typically, they appear as enlarged hypoechoic nodes with loss of fat hilum, increased hilar and cortical vascularization at color-Doppler, but low to intermediate cortical consistence at shear-wave elastography. Asymmetric or diffuse cortical thickening is also frequently encountered. They can be observed in patients without and with clinical symptoms, such as armpit pain, fever and fatigue.","D039,; Auria, Divina; Fulgione, Ludovica; Romeo, Valeria; Stanzione, Arnaldo; Maurea, Simone; Brunetti, Arturo",Clin Transl Imaging,,383

345140,Pediatric neurosurgery after the COVID-19 pandemic: management strategies from a single pediatric hospital in Italy,2020,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak began in China and quickly spread throughout the world and was reclassified as a pandemic in March 2020. The first case of COVID-19 was declared in Togo on March 5. Two months later, few data were available to describe the circulation of the new coronavirus in the country. OBJECTIVE: This survey aimed to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk populations in Lomé. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 23, 2020, to May 8, 2020, we recruited a sample of participants from five sectors: health care, air transport, police, road transport and informal. We collected oropharyngeal swabs for direct detection through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and blood for antibody detection by serological tests. The overall prevalence (current and past) of infection was defined by positivity for both tests. RESULTS: A total of 955 participants with a median age of 36 (IQR 32-43) were included, and 71.6% (n = 684) were men. Approximately 22.1% (n = 212) were from the air transport sector, 20.5% (n = 196) were from the police sector, and 38.7% (n = 370) were from the health sector. Seven participants (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.3-1.6%) had a positive rRT-PCR test result at the time of recruitment, and nine (0.9%, 95% CI: 0.4-1.8%) were seropositive for IgM or IgG against SARS-CoV-2. We found an overall prevalence of 1.6% (n = 15), 95% CI: 0.9-2.6%. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among high-risk populations in Lomé was relatively low and could be explained by the various measures taken by the Togolese government. Therefore, we recommend targeted screening.","Halatoko, Wemboo Afiwa; Konu, Yao Rodion; Gbeasor-Komlanvi, Fifonsi Adjidossi; Sadio, Arnold Junior; Tchankoni, Martin Kouame; Komlanvi, Koffi Segbeaya; Salou, Mounerou; Dorkenoo, Ameyo Monique; Maman, Issaka; Agbobli, Amétépé; Wateba, Majesté Ihou; Adjoh, Komi Séraphin; Goeh-Akue, Edem; Kao, Yem-Bla; Kpeto, Innocent; Pana, Paul; Kinde-Sossou, Rebecca; Tamekloe, Agbeko; Nayo-Apétsianyi, Josée; Assane, Simon-Pierre Hamadi; Prine-David, Mireille; Awoussi, Sossinou Marcel; Djibril, Mohaman; Mijiyawa, Moustafa; Dagnra, Anoumou Claver; Ekouevi, Didier Koumavi",PLoS One,,383

346383,Infection Control against COVID-19 in Departments of Radiology,2020,"One major concern in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic has been to ensure the protection of certain categories of population considered to be at especially high risk in the event of an infection. This article gives an overview of the legal status of the &lt;&lt;vulnerable&gt;&gt; person in Switzerland and explores the role of the treating physician in this context, particularly with regard to labour law. The physician will have to assess the status of &lt;&lt;vulnerable person&gt;&gt; and, where applicable, issue a vulnerability certificate that can be presented to the employer. In the face of a legal framework that is often ambiguous and in continuous evolution, this role places significant responsibility on the physicians, who will need to ensure that they stay within a clinical evaluation and the scope of their expertise. Accepted practices in relation to medical certificates for work incapacity may act as valuable guidance.","Martin-Achard, P.; Viret, M.",Revue Medicale Suisse,,383
346458,The impact of COVID-19 on familial Mediterranean fever: a nationwide study,2021,"The aim of this review was threefold: (a) to retrieve all SARS-CoV-2 evidences published by Italian neonatologists working in maternity centers and NICUs during the pandemic; (b) to summarize current evidence for the management of term and preterm infants with a SARS-CoV-2-related illness; and (c) to provide an update for dealing with the second wave of COVID-19 and discuss open questions. A review was conducted using MEDLINE/PubMed and the national COVID-19 registry of the Italian Society of Neonatology including citations from December 1, 2019 to October 28, 2020. Sixty-three articles were included. Collected data were divided into the following topics: (a) antenatal management, (b) management in delivery room, (c) postnatal management, (d) mother-baby dyad and breastfeeding management, (e) neonatal emergency transport system reorganization, (f) parents' management and perspective during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and (g) future perspective. Evidences have evolved over the pandemic period and the current review can be useful in the management of the mother-neonate dyad during SARS-CoV-2 future waves. Italian neonatologists have played an active role in producing official guidelines and reporting data that have contributed to improve the care of neonates. A joint European action plan is mandatory to face COVID-19 in neonates with more awareness. IMPACT: A joint European action plan is mandatory to face COVID-19 in neonates with more awareness. This review summarizes the available evidences from neonatal COVID-19 management in Italy analyzing all the published paper in this specific field of interest.

347668,Re: Urological surgery in the COVID-19 era: Patient counselling and informed consent,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The English government approved both stages of early medical abortion (EMA), using mifepristone and misoprostol under 10 weeks' gestation, for at-home use on 30 March 2020. MSI Reproductive Choices UK (MSUK), one of the largest providers of abortion services in England, launched a no-test telemedicine EMA pathway on 6 April 2020. The objectives of this study were to report key patient-reported outcome measures and to assess whether our sample was representative of the whole population receiving no-test telemedicine EMA. METHODS: A sample of all MSUK's telemedicine EMA patients between April and August 2020 were invited to opt in to a follow-up call to answer clinical and satisfaction questions. A total of 1243 (13.7% of all telemedicine EMAs) were successfully followed-up, on average within 5 days post-procedure. RESULTS: Patients reported high confidence in telemedicine EMA and high satisfaction with the convenience, privacy and ease of managing their abortion at home. The sample responding were broadly equivalent to the whole population receiving telemedicine. No patient reported that they were unable to consult privately. The majority (1035, 83%) of patients reported preferring the telemedicine pathway, with 824 (66%) indicating that they would choose telemedicine again if COVID-19 were no longer an issue. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine EMA is a valued, private, convenient and more accessible option that is highly acceptable for patients seeking an abortion, especially those for whom in-clinic visits are logistically or emotionally challenging. Evidence that this pathway would be a first choice again in future for most patients supports the case to make telemedicine EMA permanent.","Porter Erlank, Chelsey; Lord, Jonathan; Church, Kathryn",BMJ sex. reprod. health (Online),,383
347769,Evaluation of Transient Ischemic Attack and Minor Stroke: A Rapid Outpatient Model for the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond,2021,"An unprecedented biological function of natural cardenolides independent of their membrane target Na+/K+-ATPase is disclosed. Previously, we reported that cardenolides impart anti-transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (anti-TGEV) activity through the targeting of Na+/K+-ATPase and its associated PI3K_PDK1_RSK2 signaling. Swine testis cells with Na+/K+-ATPase &#945;1 knocked down exhibited decreased susceptibility to TGEV infectivity and attenuated PI3K_PDK1_RSK2 signaling. Herein, we further explored a Na+/K+-ATPase-independent signaling axis induced by natural cardenolides that also afforded significant anti-coronaviral activity for porcine TGEV and human HCoV-OC43. Using pharmacological inhibition and gene silencing techniques, we found that this anti-TGEV or anti-HCoV-OC43 activity was caused by JAK1 proteolysis and mediated through upstream activation of Ndfip1/2 and its effector NEDD4. This study provides novel insights into the pharmacological effects of natural cardenolides, and is expected to inform their future development as antiviral agents.","Yang, Cheng-Wei; Hsu, Hsing-Yu; Chang, Hsin-Yu; Lee, Yue-Zhi; Lee, Shiow-Ju",Biochem Pharmacol,,383

348731,Practice recommendations for neurovascular ultrasound investigations of acute stroke patients in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic: an expert consensus from the European Society of Neurosonology and Cerebral Hemodynamics,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has led to a severe medical, social and economic crisis globally. Use of antivirals has given inconsistent results; thus systematic summaries of available evidence are required for any recommendations for treatment. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of antivirals for Covid-19. Methods: The databases we searched were-Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and Medrxiv. Title/abstract screening, full-text screening and data abstraction were carried out in duplicate by two researchers. Pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method of random effects for meta-analysis. Results: Twenty studies were found eligible for inclusion: 6 randomized controlled trials, 9 cohort studies and 5 case series. Moderate-quality evidence suggests a likely clinical benefit from the use of remdesivir in improving the number of recoveries (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.07-1.31; I2 = 0%) and time to recovery in days (median -3.02; 95% CI -4.98 to -1.07; I2 = 97%). A possibility of lower mortality is suggested by low-quality evidence with remdesivir (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.40-1.37, I2 = 58%). Moderate-quality evidence suggests no certain benefit of using lopinavir/ritonavir for Covid-19 compared to arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir combined with arbidol or other medications used as controls. Conclusion: Further evidence from randomized controlled trials is required for all antivirals to treat Covid-19. At present, remdesivir seems more promising than other antivirals.","Prasad, Manya; Elavarasi, Arunmozhimaran; Madan, Karan; Nischal, Neeraj; Soneja, Manish; Seth, Tulika; Sahoo, Ranjit Kumar; Sharma, Atul; Garg, Pramod",Natl Med J India,,383

349443,Risk Factors of Outcomes of COVID-19 Patients in Korea: Focus on Early Symptoms,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Olfactory dysfunction in upper airway viral infections (common cold, acute rhinosinusitis) is common (> 60%). During the COVID-19 outbreak, frequency of sensory disorders (smell and/or taste) in affected patients has shown a high variability from 5 to 98%, depending on the methodology, country, and study. RECENT FINDINGS: A sudden, severe, isolated loss of smell and/or taste, in the absence of other upper airway inflammatory diseases (allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis), should alert individuals and physicians on being potentially affected by COVID-19. The evaluation of smell/taste disorders with a visual analogue scale or an individual olfactory or gustatory test, at the hospital or by telemedicine, to prevent contamination might facilitate an early detection of infected patients and reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. During the COVID-19 outbreak, patients with sudden loss of smell should initiate social distancing and home isolation measures and be tested for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test when available. Olfactory training is recommended when smell does not come back after 1 month but can be started earlier.","Mullol, Joaquim; Alobid, Isam; Mariño-Sánchez, Franklin; Izquierdo-Domínguez, Adriana; Marin, Concepció; Klimek, Ludger; Wang, De-Yun; Liu, Zheng",Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,,383

352520,COVID-19: The heart of the issue,2020,"The novel coronavirus, since its first outbreak in December, has, up till now, affected approximately 114,542 people across 115 countries. Many international agencies are devoting efforts to enhance the understanding of the evolving COVID-19 outbreak on an international level, its influences, and preparedness. At present, COVID-19 appears to affect individuals through person-to-person means, like other commonly found cold or influenza viruses. It is widely known and acknowledged that viruses causing influenza peak during cold temperatures and gradually subside in the warmer temperature, owing to their seasonality. Thus, COVID-19, due to its regular flu-like symptoms, is also expected to show similar seasonality and subside as the global temperatures rise in the northern hemisphere with the onset of spring. Despite these speculations, however, the systematic analysis in the global perspective of the relation between COVID-19 spread and meteorological parameters is unavailable. Here, by analyzing the region- and city-specific affected global data and corresponding meteorological parameters, we show that there is an optimum range of temperature and UV index strongly affecting the spread and survival of the virus, whereas precipitation, relative humidity, cloud cover, etc. have no effect on the virus. Unavailability of pharmaceutical interventions would require greater preparedness and alert for the effective control of COVID-19. Under these conditions, the information provided here could be very helpful for the global community struggling to fight this global crisis. It is, however, important to note that the information presented here clearly lacks any physiological evidences, which may merit further investigation. Thus, any attempt for management, implementation, and evaluation strategies responding to the crisis arising due to the COVID-19 outbreak must not consider the evaluation presented here as the foremost factor.","Gunthe, Sachin S; Swain, Basudev; Patra, Satya S; Amte, Aneesh",Z Gesundh Wiss,,383

Using in-silico docking studies and genome based various molecular targets, and their in vitro anti-SARS CoV-2 activities against whole cell and/or selected protein targets, we select a few compounds of interest, which can be used as potential leads to counteract effects of uncontrolled innate immune responses, in particular those related to the cytokine storm. A critical factor for prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection relates to factors independent of viral infection or host response. They include population-related variables such as concurrent comorbidities and genetic factors critically relevant to COVID-19 health disparities. We discuss population risk factors related to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we focus on virulence related to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd), the most common human enzymopathy. Review of data on the response of individuals and communities with high prevalence of G6PDd to NP, prompts us to propose the rationale for a population-specific management approach to rationalize design of therapeutic interventions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on use of NP. This strategy may lead to personalized approaches and improve disease-related outcomes.","Gomez, Christian R; Espinoza, Ingrid; Faruque, Fazlay S; Hasan, Md.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: From April 23 to 27, 2020, an online survey was completed by 1,600 community-dwelling older adults in Japan. METHODS: We assessed the frailty status using the Kihon checklist, and other demographics and asked questions regarding PA at two time points: January and April 2020. We defined the total PA time (minutes) per week based on activity frequency and time. RESULTS: The study participants' mean age, proportion of women, and prevalence of frailty were 74.0±5.6 years, 50% (n=800), and 24.3% (n=388), respectively. We found a significant decrease in total PA time in April 2020 (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 180 [0 to 420]) when compared to January 2020 (median [IQR], 245 [90 to 480]) (P<0.001). We also performed a subgroup analysis according to the frailty category; total PA time significantly decreased in April 2020 when compared to January 2020 for all frailty categories (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the total PA time in April 2020 significantly decreased compared to that in January 2020 in older adults. This finding may lead to a higher incidence of disability in the near future in older people.","Yamada, M; Kimura, Y; Ishiyama, D; Otobe, Y; Suzuki, M; Koyama, S; Kikuchi, T; Kusumi, H; Arai, H",J Nutr Health Aging,,383

It is challenging to equate these techniques since they were built on separate datasets, educated on various training sets, and tested using different metrics. In this research, a deep learning semantic segmentation architecture for COVID-19 lesions detection in limited chest CT datasets will be presented. The proposed model architecture consists of the encoder and the decoder components. The encoder component contains three layers of convolution and pooling, while the decoder contains three layers of deconvolutional and upsampling. The dataset consists of 20 CT scans of lungs belongs to 20 patients from two sources of data. The total number of images in the dataset is 3520 CT scans with its labelled images. The dataset is split into 70% for the training phase and 30% for the testing phase. Images of the dataset are passed through the pre-processing phase to be resized and normalized. Five experimental trials are conducted through the research with different images selected for the training and the testing phases for every trial. The proposed model achieves 0.993 in the global accuracy, and 0.987, 0.799, 0.874 for weighted IoU, mean IoU and mean BF score accordingly.

Structural equation modeling was used to study the relationship between the risk of in-store infection, emotions and in-shop behavior, based on data retrieved from 914 questionnaires. Results showed, that the perceived risk of becoming infected in a store causes an increase in arousal and, at the same time, a decrease in perceived pleasure during shopping. The rise in arousal led to an increase in consumers taking actions to decrease their risk of contagion, while an increase in noticeable pleasure lowered interest of following recommendations for pandemic behavior. The findings imply that through changes regarding in-store atmosphere, stationary shops can provide consumers with a sense of urgency and awareness of infection risk so that they may do their shopping more efficiently.","Szymkowiak, Andrzej; Gaczek, Piotr; Jeganathan, Kishokanth; Kulawik, Piotr",J.

METHODS: Pregnant women with COVID-19 infection were identified at two affiliated hospitals in New York City from March 13 to April 19, 2020, for this case series study. Women were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection based on either universal testing on admission or testing because of COVID-19-related symptoms. Disease was classified as either 1) asymptomatic or mild or 2) moderate or severe based on dyspnea, tachypnea, or hypoxia. Clinical and demographic risk factors for moderate or severe disease were analyzed and calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Laboratory findings and associated symptoms were compared between those with mild or asymptomatic and moderate or severe disease. The clinical courses and associated complications of women hospitalized with moderate and severe disease are described. RESULTS: Of 158 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, 124 (78%) had mild or asymptomatic disease and 34 (22%) had moderate or severe disease. Of 15 hospitalized women with moderate or severe disease, 10 received respiratory support with supplemental oxygen and one required intubation. Women with moderate or severe disease had a higher likelihood of having an underlying medical comorbidity (50% vs 27%, OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.26-6.02). Asthma was more common among those with moderate or severe disease (24% vs 8%, OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.26-9.75). Women with moderate or severe disease were significantly more likely to have leukopenia and elevated aspartate transaminase and ferritin. Women with moderate or severe disease were at significantly higher risk for cough and chest pain and pressure. Nine women received ICU or step-down-level care, including four for 9 days or longer. Two women underwent preterm delivery because their clinical status deteriorated.

357085,COVID-19 infection in cancer patients: what has been the contribution of Associazione Italiana Oncologia Medica (AIOM) to oncological care since the beginning of the first pandemic wave?,2021,"The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an established receptor and entry point for the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, as the spike protein on the viral envelope binds the ACE2 receptor. Published histological profiling revealed ACE2 to be highly expressed on human lung alveolar epithelial cells and on enterocytes of the small intestine, as well as on arterial and venous endothelial cells. Given the widespread abundance of ACE2 across tissues, there has been much speculation regarding whether ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and/or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) might alter tissue ACE2 expression and thereby change the risk of transmission or development of severe complications. Therefore, the aim of this ongoing study is to measure the impact of ACEi and ARB singly and in combination versus placebo control on tissue distribution of ACE2 in male and female mice. A factorial design was employed with the following exposures: ACEi (lisinopril, 10 mg/kg/day), ARB (losartan, 10 mg/kg/day), both drugs, or water control. Drugs were delivered via drinking water. C57BL/6J Mice were 8 weeks of age at the start of the experiment. After 21 days of treatment, four mice (two males and two females) from each treatment group were euthanized, followed by perfusion and tissue collection. 12 more untreated mice were combined with the placebo group to increase the sample size of this reference group to 16 (8 males, 8 females). ACE2 protein abundance in brain, kidney, liver, lung, and small intestine was measured by ELISA (Abcam) and normalized to BCA-measured total protein. Two-way ANOVA was performed to test for differences in ACE2 levels by organ or sex among untreated mice;Mann-Whitney tests were performed to compare each drug treatment group to the control group. Among untreated mice, ACE2 levels differed by organ (p &lt; 0.01), but there were no differences between males and females for a given organ (p = 0.20). Males and females were combined for subsequent analyses. After 21 days of treatment, ACEi, ARB, and the combination therapy lowered ACE2 tissue abundance compared to untreated mice in the brain (ACEi p = 0.04;ARB p = 0.04;ACEi+ARB p = 0.01), kidney (ACEi p = 0.03;ARB p = 0.02;ACEi+ARB p = 0.02), and lung (ACEi p = 0.01;ARB p = 0.01;ACEi+ARB p = 0.01). ACEi, but not ARB or combination therapy, lowered ACE2 tissue abundance in the liver (p = 0.02). None of the treatments changed ACE2 tissue abundance in the small intestine. These results indicate that ACEi, ARB, or combination therapy reduces levels of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in key tissues affected by the virus, including lung, kidney, and brain.

357086,COVID-19 infection in cancer patients: what has been the contribution of Associazione Italiana Oncologia Medica (AIOM) to oncological care since the beginning of the first pandemic wave?,2021,"The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an established receptor and entry point for the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, as the spike protein on the viral envelope binds the ACE2 receptor Published histological profiling revealed ACE2 to be highly expressed on human lung alveolar epithelial cells and on enterocytes of the small intestine, as well as on arterial and venous endothelial cells Given the widespread abundance of ACE2 across tissues, there has been much speculation regarding whether ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and/or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) might alter tissue ACE2 expression and thereby change the risk of transmission or development of severe complications Therefore, the aim of this ongoing study is to measure the impact of ACEi and ARB singly and in combination versus placebo control on tissue distribution of ACE2 in male and female mice A factorial design was employed with the following exposures: ACEi (lisinopril, 10 mg/kg/day), ARB (losartan, 10 mg/kg/day), both drugs, or water control Drugs were delivered via drinking water C57BL/6J Mice were 8 weeks of age at the start of the experiment After 21 days of treatment, four mice (two males and two females) from each treatment group were euthanized, followed by perfusion and tissue collection 12 more untreated mice were combined with the placebo group to increase the sample size of this reference group to 16 (8 males, 8 females) ACE2 protein abundance in brain, kidney, liver, lung, and small intestine was measured by ELISA (Abcam) and normalized to BCA-measured total protein Two-way ANOVA was performed to test for differences in ACE2 levels by organ or sex among untreated mice;Mann-Whitney tests were performed to compare each drug treatment group to the control group Among untreated mice, ACE2 levels differed by organ (p &lt; 0 01), but there were no differences between males and females for a given organ (p = 0 20) Males and females were combined for subsequent analyses After 21 days of treatment, ACEi, ARB, and the combination therapy lowered ACE2 tissue abundance compared to untreated mice in the brain (ACEi p = 0 04;ARB p = 0 04;ACEi+ARB p = 0 01), kidney (ACEi p = 0 03;ARB p = 0 02;ACEi+ARB p = 0 02), and lung (ACEi p = 0 01;ARB p = 0 01;ACEi+ARB p = 0 01) ACEi, but not ARB or combination therapy, lowered ACE2 tissue abundance in the liver (p = 0 02) None of the treatments changed ACE2 tissue abundance in the small intestine These results indicate that ACEi, ARB, or combination therapy reduces levels of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in key tissues affected by the virus, including lung, kidney, and brain An ongoing validation study will evaluate ACE2 protein and gene expression at earlier time points, as well as after discontinuation of treatment These results will provide valuable insight into the risk or potential benefit of starting or stopping ACEi, ARB, or combination therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic","da Silva Moreira, Aline Brooks Steven Smith Rachel Moore Ian Ackerman Hans",The FASEB Journal,,383
357294,Progression Risk in People with HIV and COVID-19: Predictive Performance of Current Risk Scores,2021,"One of the new scientific ways of understanding discourse dynamics is analyzing the public data of social networks. This research's aim is Post-structuralist Discourse Analysis (PDA) of Covid-19 phenomenon (inspired by Laclau and Mouffe's Discourse Theory) by using Intelligent Data Mining for Persian Society. The examined big data is five million tweets from 160,000 users of the Persian Twitter network to compare two discourses. Besides analyzing the tweet texts individually, a social network graph database has been created based on retweets relationships. We use the VoteRank algorithm to introduce and rank people whose posts become word of mouth, provided that the total information spreading scope is maximized over the network. These users are also clustered according to their word usage pattern (the Gaussian Mixture Model is used). The constructed discourse of influential spreaders is compared to the most active users. This analysis is done based on Covid-related posts over eight episodes. Also, by relying on the statistical content analysis and polarity of tweet words, discourse analysis is done for the whole mentioned subpopulations, especially for the top individuals. The most important result of this research is that the Twitter subjects' discourse construction is government-based rather than community-based. The analyzed Iranian society does not consider itself responsible for the Covid-19 wicked problem, does not believe in participation, and expects the government to solve all problems. The most active and most influential users' similarity is that political, national, and critical discourse construction is the predominant one. In addition to the advantages of its research methodology, it is necessary to pay attention to the study's limitations. Suggestion for future encounters of Iranian society with similar crises is given.","Shokrollahi, Omid; Hashemi, Niloofar; Dehghani, Mohammad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00298v1.pdf,383

358227,Nutrition amid the COVID-19 pandemic: a multi-level framework for action,2020,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent oncological diseases globally, taking 3rd place in incidence in the general population. High in mortality, it is also a form of cancer whose outcome is highly dependable on its stage at diagnosis. Therefore, many countries have adopted a more or less successful screening process to ensure early diagnosis and, in turn, higher survival rates and better results overall. The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the established medical routines worldwide, with massively postponing diagnostic procedures and elective surgeries. This study aims to measure the effect the pandemic has had on colorectal cancer treatment in our Institution. Variables such as deferral time from diagnosis to commencement of treatment, lapse of time between different phases of the treatment process, time of presentation (elective versus emergent surgery), the physical status of the patient at the time of surgery (ASA classification) and metastatic index (positive lymph node ratio), were taken into account. We juxtaposed data from patients treated at the Surgical Department of Clinical Hospital Center in Zagreb in 2019 and 2020, the latter being heavily affected by the pandemic. In 2019 and 2020, 347 and 314 patients, respectively, with C18-C20 diagnoses (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD-10), have been treated at our Hospital. With exclusion criteria applied, the patient count falls to 173 for 2019 and 157 for 2020. These numbers include operated cases with or without an anastomosis formation and with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy applied. From the analysis we excluded patients with recurrent colorectal tumors, synchronous and metachronous tumors, and patients treated palliatively. Furthermore, colorectal adenomas were also excluded from the study. Our data shows significant difference between observed variables in the two patient groups, attributed to the COVID- 19 pandemic. Since there is still no reliable way to predict the duration of this global health crisis, it is imperative to implement strategies to lessen the damaging effect the pandemic has had on favourable oncosurgical treatment outcomes in colorectal cancer patients.","MatoŠEvic, P.; BioŠIc, V.; Brkic, L.; Matijevic, A.; Milicevic, O.; Trkulja, I.; Silovski, H.; Kinda, E.",Libri Oncologici,,383
358381,How Cyber Criminals Use Covid,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious virus that is transmitted primarily through droplets or by coming in close contact with an infected person. In 2020, there was a global outbreak of COVID-19, resulting in an unprecedented global burden of disease, health care costs, and had a significant economic impact. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 was detected on the outer packaging of imported cold chain items in China and has led to virus transmission events, causing great concern. This paper analyses the factors of SARS-CoV-2 survival and transmission in different places and environments, especially the characteristics of low temperatures and object surfaces. It was found that SARS-CoV-2 could survive on surfaces of cold and moist objects in the cold chain for more than 3 weeks, potentially causing COVID-19 transmission. We believe that the low-temperature environment in winter may accelerate the spread of the outbreak and new outbreaks may occur. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 transmission that is susceptible to low winter temperatures is critical for predicting winter pandemics, allowing for the appropriate action to be taken in advance.","Chi, Yuhua; Wang, Qingxiu; Chen, Guosheng; Zheng, Shiliang",Front Public Health,,383

Although there is evidence that adult patients present later with complicated appendicitis, the impact on the paediatric population is unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation and management of paediatric appendicitis. METHODS: Data from consecutive paediatric patients admitted with right iliac fossa pain to a teaching hospital from 1 March 2020 until 30 June 2020 (COVID-19) were compared with patients admitted from 1 March 2019 until 30 June 2019 (control). RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-two patients were admitted with right iliac fossa pain (control = 97, COVID-19 = 75). Seven patients had a normal diagnostic laparoscopy in the control group compared with none in the COVID-19 group. The proportion of patients diagnosed with appendicitis was significantly higher during the COVID-19 pandemic (24% vs. 10%, P = 0.03). They presented later (3 days vs. 1 day, P < 0.01) with higher inflammatory markers (white cell count 15.8 vs. 13.2 × 109 cells per litre, P = 0.02; C-reactive protein 53 vs. 27 mg/L P = 0.04). The majority of patients underwent surgery within 1 day of admission (94% COVID-19 vs. 70% control, P = 0.13). Although there was a trend towards a greater proportion of complicated appendicitis (22% vs. 10%, P = 0.6) during COVID-19, this did not affect outcomes (no morbidity in both groups, length of hospital stay 4 vs. 2.5 days, P = 0.29).

This study aims at assessing the analytical and clinical performance of the iFlash® anti-SARS-CoV-2 chemiluminescence assay for the detection of both IgM and IgG antibodies. The kinetics of the antibody response was also evaluated. DESIGN & METHODS: The precision, carry-over, linearity, limit of blank, detection and quantification were assessed. Sensitivity analysis was performed by using 178 sera collected from 154 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients. The specificity analysis was performed from 75 selected non-SARS-CoV-2 sera with a potential cross-reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. RESULTS: This iFlash® SARS-CoV-2 assay showed excellent analytical performance. After 2 weeks since symptom onset, the sensitivities for IgM and IgG were 62.2% (95% CI: 52.3-71.2%) and 92.9%% (95% CI: 85.7-96.7%), respectively by using the cut-off provided by the manufacturer. After cut-off optimization (i.e. >2.81 for IgM and >4.86 for IgG), the sensitivity for IgM and IgG were 81.6 (95% CI: 72.7-88.1%) and 95.9% (95% CI: 89.4-98.7%), respectively. Optimized cut-off for IgG improved the sensitivity to reach 100% (95%CI: 87.6-100) from 28 days since symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the iFlash® SARS-CoV-2 assay from YHLO biotechnology, has satisfactory analytical performance. Nevertheless, the sensitivity of the IgM is limited for a proper clinical use compared to IgG. The determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from 28 days since symptom onset was associated with high sensitivity, especially using optimized cut-offs (i.e. 100%).","Mairesse, Antoine; Favresse, Julien; Eucher, Christine; Elsen, Marc; Tré-Hardy, Marie; Haventith, Caroline; Gruson, Damien; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Douxfils, Jonathan; Göbbels, Paul",Clin. biochem,,383

A Review of Seven Months of Experience Working in a COVID-19 Dedicated Centre,2021,"Machine learning models in health care are often deployed in settings where it is important to protect patient privacy. In such settings, methods for differentially private (DP) learning provide a general-purpose approach to learn models with privacy guarantees. Modern methods for DP learning ensure privacy through mechanisms that censor information judged as too unique. The resulting privacy-preserving models, therefore, neglect information from the tails of a data distribution, resulting in a loss of accuracy that can disproportionately affect small groups. In this paper, we study the effects of DP learning in health care. We use state-of-the-art methods for DP learning to train privacy-preserving models in clinical prediction tasks, including x-ray classification of images and mortality prediction in time series data. We use these models to perform a comprehensive empirical investigation of the tradeoffs between privacy, utility, robustness to dataset shift, and fairness. Our results highlight lesser-known limitations of methods for DP learning in health care, models that exhibit steep tradeoffs between privacy and utility, and models whose predictions are disproportionately influenced by large demographic groups in the training data. We discuss the costs and benefits of differentially private learning in health care.","Suriyakumar, Vinith M.; Papernot, Nicolas; Goldenberg, Anna; Ghassemi, Marzyeh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06667v1.pdf,383
362837,First Cuban community quarantined by COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: With increasing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prevalence, there is a need for effective programs that support diabetes management and improve T2DM outcomes. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have shown promising results. With advances in wearable sensors and improved integration, mHealth programs could become more accessible and personalized. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a personalized mHealth-anchored intervention program in improving glycemic control and enhancing care experience in diabetes management. The program was coincidentally implemented during the national-level lockdown for COVID-19 in Singapore, allowing for a timely study of the use of mHealth for chronic disease management. METHODS: Patients with T2DM or prediabetes were enrolled from the Singapore Armed Forces and offered a 3-month intervention program in addition to the usual care they received. The program was standardized to include: (1) in-person initial consultation with a clinical dietitian, (2) in-person review with a diabetes specialist doctor, (3) one Continuous Glucose Monitoring device, (4) access to the mobile app for dietary intake and physical activity tracking, and communication via messaging with the dietitian and doctor, and (5) context-sensitive digital health coaching over the mobile app. Medical support was rendered to the patients on an as-needed basis when they required advice on adjustment of medications. Measurements of weight, height, and glycated hemoglobin A (HbA1c) were conducted at two in-person visits at the start and end of the program. At the end of the program, patients were asked to complete a short acceptability feedback survey to understand the motivation for joining the program, their satisfaction, and suggestions for improvement. RESULTS: Over a four-week recruitment period, 130 individuals were screened and the enrolment target of 30 patients was met. Twenty-one patients completed the program and were included in the final analyses. Nine patients were lost to follow-up and did not have full data available for the final analyses. There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics between patients that were included and excluded from the final analyses. The 21 completers rated a mean of 9.0 out of 10 on the Likert scale for both satisfaction questions. For the Yes-No question on benefit of the program, all of the patients selected ""Yes"". Mean HbA1c decreased from 7.6% to 7.0% (P=.004). There were no severe hypoglycemia events (glucose level <3.0 mmol/L) reported. Mean weight decreased from 76.8 kg to 73.9 kg (P<.001) - mean decrease of 3.5% from baseline weight. Mean body mass index decreased from 27.8 kg/m2 to 26.7 kg/m2 (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The personalized mHealth program was feasible and acceptable, and produced significant reductions in HbA1c and body weight in individuals with T2DM. Such mHealth programs could overcome challenges posed to chronic disease management by COVID-19, including disruptions to in-person healthcare access.","Ang, Ian Yi Han; Tan, Kyle Xin Quan; Tan, Clive; Tan, Chiew Hoon; Kwek, James Wei-Ming; Tay, Joanne; Toh, Sue-Anne Ee Shiow",,,383

According to the results, an increase in the efficiency of sorption preparations containing Polysorbate 20 is based on an intensification of the bentonite aggregate disintegration into individual montmorillonite particles and a formation of more dense protective sorption layer providing a better protection of seeds against allelotoxins on the seed surface. The introduction of non-ionogenic surfactants into the preparation increases a sorption capacity of a bentonite-humus complex that results in a decreased gibberellin activity in a solution. Therefore, to achieve the maximum physiological activity of gibberellin in a preparation solution, it is necessary to increase its concentration from 100 to 300 mg/L.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess how counts of criminal charges have been affected by COVID-19 social distancing measures and related policy changes. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: This study used publicly available court filings pertaining to child abuse and neglect from Jan 1, 2010 to June 30, 2020. METHODS: Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithms were constructed with case data from January 2010 to January 2020 to forecast trends in criminal charges for February to June 2020. These forecasted values were then compared to actual charges filed for this time period. RESULTS: Criminal cases filed between February and June 2020, had an overall 25.7 percent lower average than forecasted. All individual months had progressively lower cases than forecasted with the exception of March. June had the largest deviation from forecasted with 60.1 percent fewer cases than predicted. CONCLUSIONS: Although risk factors for child abuse have increased due to COVID-19, these findings demonstrate a declining trend in child abuse charges. Rather than a decreasing incidence of child abuse and neglect, it is more likely that less cases are being reported. The results warrant immediate action and further investigation in order to address the dangers this pandemic poses for children in abusive situations.","Whelan, John; Hartwell, Micah; Chesher, Tessa; Coffey, Sara; Hendrix, Amy D; Passmore, Sarah J; Baxter, Michael A; den Harder, Margaret; Greiner, Benjamin",Child Abuse Negl,,383
364129,"Epidemiological analysis of 3,219 COVID-19 outbreaks in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany",2021,"Introduction: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a rare, severe fungal infection with a poor prognosis and high mortality rate. IPA is mainly noted in patients with immunosuppressed status, hematological malignancies and stem cell transplants. Diagnosis is challenging and requires a high index of suspicion. Current literature supports treating patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia with high dose dexamethasone therapy for a prolonged period of time which may cause significant immune suppression. Here, we present a case of a patient with covid-19 pneumonia who developed IPA after dexamethasone and tocilizumab therapy. Case report: Patient is a 75-year-old male who was admitted to the medical ICU with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to covid-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation immediately on presentation to the emergency room. The patient had a past history of cavitary lung disease secondary to tuberculosis in 2018 and had completed treatment with 4-drug therapy. During this hospitalization, three sputum samples were negative for acid fast bacillus. He was started on dexamethasone therapy of 6mg daily for 10 days and received a single dose of tocilizumab. The patient initially improved but started to worsen again on the ninth day requiring increased ventilatory support and pronation therapy. His sputum culture grew Aspergillus FLavus. CT chest showed increased parenchymal infiltrates around prior cavitary lung disease. Serum aspergillus galactomannan antigen returned positive. Patient was started on intravenous Voriconazole. After initial improvement, the patient developed hemoptysis and worsening oxygenation. As per the family's wishes, patient was transitioned to comfort care and he passed away after compassionate extubation. Discussion:Treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia with high dose dexamethasone therapy may inadvertently cause an immunosuppressed state. These immunosuppressive effects may be further compounded by concurrent use of tocilizumab. Relative immunosuppression combined with possible epithelial damage due to viral infection may be a mechanism for development of IPA. A case series from France reported possible IPA in 9 of 27 (33.3%) ICU patients with COVID-19 with an expectedly high observed mortality rate. Conclusion: Clinicians should carry a high index of suspicion and pursue early investigations for other infections in COVID-19 patients who are not recovering or have worsened after initial improvement. Careful use of steroids in patients with prior structural lung disease is also warranted as they may be at high risk of developing IPA due to pre-existing aspergillus colonization.","Desai, H.

Recently, several methods and techniques have been proposed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus using different images and data. However, this is the first study that will explore the possibility of using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to detect COVID-19 from electrocardiogram (ECG) trace images. In this work, COVID-19 and other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) were detected using deep-learning techniques. A public dataset of ECG images consists of 1937 images from five distinct categories, such as Normal, COVID-19, myocardial infarction (MI), abnormal heartbeat (AHB), and recovered myocardial infarction (RMI) were used in this study. Six different deep CNN models (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and MobileNetv2) were used to investigate three different classification schemes: two-class classification (Normal vs COVID-19); three-class classification (Normal, COVID-19, and Other CVDs), and finally, five-class classification (Normal, COVID-19, MI, AHB, and RMI). For two-class and three-class classification, Densenet201 outperforms other networks with an accuracy of 99.1%, and 97.36%, respectively; while for the five-class classification, InceptionV3 outperforms others with an accuracy of 97.83%. ScoreCAM visualization confirms that the networks are learning from the relevant area of the trace images. Since the proposed method uses ECG trace images which can be captured by smartphones and are readily available facilities in low-resources countries, this study will help in faster computer-aided diagnosis of COVID-19 and other cardiac abnormalities.","Rahman, Tawsifur; Akinbi, Alex; Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

364430,[Vitamin D supplementation and COVID-19: expert consensus and guidelines],2020,"I study the economic effects of testing during the outbreak of a novel disease. I propose a model where testing permits isolation of the infected and provides agents with information about the prevalence and lethality of the disease. Additional testing reduces the perceived lethality of the disease, but might increase the perceived risk of infection. As a result, more testing could increase the perceived risk of dying from the disease - i.e.""stoke fear""- and cause a fall in economic activity, despite improving health outcomes. Two main insights emerge. First, increased testing is beneficial to the economy and pays for itself if performed at a sufficiently large scale, but not necessarily otherwise. Second, heterogeneous risk perceptions across age-groups can have important aggregate consequences. For a SARS-CoV-2 calibration of the model, heterogeneous risk perceptions across young and old individuals mitigate GDP losses by 50% and reduce the death toll by 30% relative to a scenario in which all individuals have the same perceptions of risk.","Furno, Francesco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03834v1.pdf,383

365260,ENDOCRINOLOGY IN THE TIME OF COVID-19: Management of diabetes insipidus and hyponatraemia,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir has not been proven, it has been proposed as an off-label treatment for COVID-19. Previously, it has been reported that the plasma concentrations of lopinavir significantly increase in inflammatory settings. As COVID-19 may be associated with major inflammation, assessing the plasma concentrations and safety of lopinavir in COVID-19 patients is essential. METHODS: Real-world COVID-19 data based on a retrospective study. RESULTS: Among the 31 COVID-19 patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir between March 18, 2020 and April 1, 2020, it was observed higher lopinavir plasma concentrations, which increased by 4.6-fold (interquartile range: 3.6-6.2), as compared to the average plasma concentrations in HIV. Lopinavir concentrations in all except one patient were above the upper limit of the concentration range of HIV treatment. Approximately one to five patients prematurely stopped treatment mainly due to an ADR related to hepatic or gastrointestinal disorders. CONCLUSION: Lopinavir plasma concentrations in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 were higher than expected, and they were associated with the occurrence of hepatic or gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions. However, a high plasma concentration may be required for in vivo antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, as suggested by previous studies. Therefore, in the absence of adverse drug reaction, lopinavir dosage should not be reduced. Cautionu is essential because off-label use can be associated with a new drug safety profile.","Chouchana, Laurent; Boujaafar, Sana; Gana, Ines; Preta, Laure-Hélène; Regard, Lucile; Legendre, Paul; Azoulay, Celia; Canouï, Etienne; Zerbit, Jeremie; Carlier, Nicolas; Terrier, Benjamin; Kernéis, Solen; Batista, Rui; Treluyer, Jean-Marc; Zheng, Yi; Benaboud, Sihem",Ther. drug monit,,383
365573,COVID-19 and Risks Posed to Personnel During Endotracheal Intubation,2020,"An unprecedented outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV), subsequently termed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, emerged in Wuhan City (China) in December 2019. Despite rigorous containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to expand, causing explosive outbreaks in more than 160 countries with waves of morbidity and fatality, leading to significant public health problems. In the past 20 years, two additional epidemics caused by CoVs have occurred: severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV, which has caused a large-scale epidemic in China and 24 other countries; and respiratory syndrome-CoV of the Middle East in Saudi Arabia, which continues to cause sporadic cases. All of these viruses affect the lower respiratory tract and manifest as pneumonia in humans, but the novel SARS-Cov-2 appears to be more contagious and has spread more rapidly worldwide. This mini-review focuses on the cellular immune response to COVID-19 in human subjects, compared to other clinically relevant coronaviruses to evaluate its role in the control of infection and pathogenesis and accelerate the development of a preventive vaccine or immune therapies.","Guihot, Amélie; Litvinova, Elena; Autran, Brigitte; Debré, Patrice; Vieillard, Vincent",Front Immunol,,383
365798,Initial Report From a Swedish High-Volume Transplant Center After The First Wave of The COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: At the juncture of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is currently in an early phase of collecting clinical data and reports of its skin manifestations, and its pathophysiology is still highly conjectural. We reviewed cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 in the pediatric age group. RECENT FINDINGS: Children infected by SARS-CoV-2 usually develop milder respiratory symptoms, but cutaneous manifestations seem a little more prevalent than in adults. These skin features of infection by the coronavirus can be similar to those produced by other common viruses, but there are also reports of cases with more heterogeneous clinical pictures, which have made their classification difficult. To date, the more frequently reported skin variants featured in pediatric cases are purpuric (pseudo-chilblain, necrotic-acral ischemia, hemorrhagic macules, and/or cutaneous necrosis), morbilliform/maculopapular, erythema multiforme, urticarial, vesicular, Kawasaki-like, and miscellaneous (highly variable in both frequency and severity). Their pathophysiological mechanism is still elusive and is likely to be the result of the complex involvement of one or more mechanisms, like direct virus-induced skin damage, vasculitis-like reactions, and/or indirect injury as a consequence of a systemic inflammatory reaction. In this review, we presented and discussed clinical cases as examples of different cutaneous responses reported in some children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, differential diagnosis considerations, and a preliminary conceptual approach to some of their probable associated pathologic mechanisms.","Larenas-Linnemann, Désirée; Luna-Pech, Jorge; Navarrete-Rodríguez, Elsy M; Rodríguez-Pérez, Noel; Arias-Cruz, Alfredo; Blandón-Vijil, María Virginia; Del Rio-Navarro, Blanca E; Estrada-Cardona, Alan; Onuma-Takane, Ernesto; Pozo-Beltrán, Cesar Fireth; Valencia-Herrera, Adriana María; Ortiz-Aldana, Francisco Ignacio; Toledo-Bahena, Mirna Eréndira",Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,,383
365838,The impact of the covid-19 pandemic on gastrointestinal endoscopy activity in a tertiary care center from north-eastern romania,2021,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China. The virus infection, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), represents a global concern, as almost all countries around the world are affected. Clinical reports have confirmed several neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients such as headaches, vomiting, and nausea, indicating the involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). Neuroinvasion of coronaviruses is not a new phenomenon, as it has been demonstrated by previous autopsies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) patients who experienced similar neurologic symptoms. The hypothalamus is a complex structure that is composed of many nuclei and diverse neuronal cell groups. It is characterized by intricate intrahypothalamic circuits that orchestrate a finely tuned communication within the CNS and with the PNS. Hypothalamic circuits are critical for maintaining homeostatic challenges including immune responses to viral infections. The present article reviews the possible routes and mechanisms of neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2, with a specific focus on the role of the hypothalamic circuits in mediating the neurological symptoms noted during COVID-19 infection.","Mussa, Bashair M; Srivastava, Ankita; Verberne, Anthony J M",Viruses,,383

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19 and their implications on patient prognosis. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, SCOPUS, Europe PMC, Cochrane Central Databases, and Google Scholar + Preprint Servers. The primary endpoint of the study was poor outcomes including mortality, severe COVID-19, and the need for ICU care. RESULTS: A total of 4 studies including 784 patients were analyzed. The incidence of arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19 was 19% (9-28%; I2: 91.45). Arrhythmia occurred in 48% (38-57%; I2: 48.08) of patients with poor outcome and 6% (1-12%; I2: 85.33%) of patients without poor outcome. Patients with COVID-19 experiencing arrhythmia had an increased risk of poor outcome (RR 7.96 [3.77, 16.81], p < 0.001; I2: 71.1%). The funnel-plot analysis showed an asymmetrical funnel plot with most of the studies on the right side of the effect estimate. The regression-based Egger's test showed indication of small-study effects (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Cardiac arrhythmias were significantly associated with an increased risk of poor outcome in COVID-19. Arrhythmias were observed in 19% of patients with COVID-19 and in 48% of patients with COVID-19 and poor outcomes.","Pranata, Raymond; Huang, Ian; Raharjo, Sunu Budhi",Indian pacing and electrophysiology journal,,383
368492,UK ACHD response to COVID-19: Which adult patients are being advised to follow shielding by UK centres?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the severity of psychological distress between patients with epilepsy and healthy controls during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwest China, as well as identify potential risk factors of severe psychological distress among patients with epilepsy. METHODS: This cross-sectional case-control study examined a consecutive sample of patients older than 15 years treated at the epilepsy center of West China Hospital between February 1 and February 29, 2020. As controls, sex- and age-matched healthy visitors of inpatients (unrelated to the patients) were also enrolled during the same period. Data on demographics and attention paid to COVID-19 were collected by online questionnaire, data on epilepsy features were collected from electronic medical records, and psychological distress was evaluated using the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-6). Potential risk factors of severe psychological distress were identified using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: The 252 patients and 252 controls in this study were similar along all demographic variables except family income. Patients with epilepsy showed significantly higher K-6 scores than healthy controls and spent significantly more time following the COVID-19 outbreak (both P < .001). Univariate analyses associated both diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy and time spent paying attention to COVID-19 with severe psychological distress (defined as K-6 score >12; both P &#8804; .001). Multivariate logistic regression identified two independent predictors of severe psychological distress: time spent paying attention to COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.172, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.073-1.280) and diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy (OR = 0.283, 95% CI = 0.128-0.623). SIGNIFICANCE: During public health outbreaks, clinicians and caregivers should focus not only on seizure control but also on mental health of patients with epilepsy, especially those with drug-resistant epilepsy. K-6 scores > 12 indicate severe psychological distress. This may mean, for example, encouraging patients to engage in other activities instead of excessively following media coverage of the outbreak.","Hao, Xiaoting; Zhou, Dong; Li, Zhe; Zeng, Guojun; Hao, Nanya; Li, Enzhi; Li, Wenjing; Deng, Aiping; Lin, Mintao; Yan, Bo",Epilepsia,,383

We aimed to analyze the clinical course of patients discharged from our emergency departament (ED) with pneumonia symptoms compatible with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods. We followed 102 patients discharged home with a diagnosis of pneumonia compatible with COVID19 between March 12 and 21, 2020, in our hospital in the southern part of the autonomous community of Madrid. Descriptive statistics (medians and interquartile ranges or frequencies, as appropriate) were compiled for the main variables. Treatments and prognoses were compared with c2, Kruskal–Wallis, or Mann–Whitney tests. The data then underwent logistic regression analysis. Results. Most patients (accounting for 74.5% of the discharges) were treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. The readmission rate was 15.7%;the ED revisiting rate was 25.7%. Admission was associated with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (P=.011), elevated creatine kinase (CK) (P=.004), and lymphopenia (P=.034). Hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were also related to admission. Ischemic heart disease was associated with longer duration of symptoms. Conclusions. Lymphopenia, and elevated LDH and CK levels predicted the need for hospital admission better than other traditional biological markers in patients with mild to moderate symptoms.

The main feature of our model lies in the fact that the disease's transmission rate is a diffusive stochastic process whose trend can be adjusted via costly confinement policies. We provide a complete theoretical analysis, as well as numerical experiments illustrating the structure of the optimal lockdown policy. In all our experiments the latter is characterized by three distinct periods: the epidemic is first let freely evolve, then vigorously tamed, and finally a less stringent containment should be adopted. Moreover, the optimal containment policy is such that the product ""reproduction number × percentage of susceptible"" is kept after a certain date strictly below the critical level of one, although the reproduction number is let oscillate above one in the last more relaxed phase of lockdown. Finally, an increase in the fluctuations of the transmission rate is shown to give rise to an earlier beginning of the optimal lockdown policy, which is also diluted over a longer period of time.","Federico, Salvatore; Ferrari, Giorgio",J Math Econ,,383

The results show the importance of early intervention: shutdowns and mask mandates reduced the COVID-19 infection growth rate immediately after being imposed statewide. Over the longer term, mask mandates had a larger effect on flattening the curve than shutdowns. The increase in the daily infection growth rate pushed state governments to shut down, but reopening led to significant increases in new cases 21 days afterward. The results suggest a dynamic social distancing approach: a shutdown for a short period followed by reopening, combined with universal mask wearing. We also found that the COVID-19 growth rate increased in states with higher percentages of essential workers (during reopening) and higher percentages of minorities (during the mask mandate period). Health insurance access for low-income workers (via Medicaid expansion) helped to reduce COVID-19 cases in the reopening model. The implications for public health show the importance of access to health insurance and mask mandates to protect low-income essential workers, but minority groups still face a higher risk of infection during the pandemic.","Zhang, Xue; Warner, Mildred E",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,383

371766,"Vitamin D, Covid-19 and Children",2020,"RATIONALE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has dramatically altered people's social lives due to social restriction measures taken to control the coronavirus spread. Early on, increased loneliness has been publicly discussed as a harmful psychological side effect of these measures. Due to the serious adverse health consequences of loneliness, it is essential to take these concerns seriously and investigate them systematically to allow for evidence-based decision making. Thus far, however, high-resolution empirical evidence of such harmful side effects is rare. METHODS: The present preregistered large-scale daily diary study assessed daily loneliness in 4,844 German adults between March 16 and April 12, 2020. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Daily loneliness slightly increased during the first two weeks since implementing the pandemic-related measures and slightly decreased thereafter.

372575,Management Considerations for the Surgical Treatment of Colorectal Cancer During the Global Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused considerable morbidity and mortality, especially in patients with underlying health conditions. A precise prognostic tool to identify poor outcomes among such cases is desperately needed. METHODS: Total 400 COVID-19 patients with underlying health conditions were retrospectively recruited from 4 centers, including 54 dead cases (labeled as poor outcomes) and 346 patients discharged or hospitalized for at least 7 days since initial CT scan. Patients were allocated to a training set (n = 271), a test set (n = 68), and an external test set (n = 61). We proposed an initial CT-derived hybrid model by combining a 3D-ResNet10 based deep learning model and a quantitative 3D radiomics model to predict the probability of COVID-19 patients reaching poor outcome. The model performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), survival analysis, and subgroup analysis. RESULTS: The hybrid model achieved AUCs of 0.876 (95% confidence interval: 0.752-0.999) and 0.864 (0.766-0.962) in test and external test sets, outperforming other models. The survival analysis verified the hybrid model as a significant risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio, 2.049 [1.462-2.871], P < 0.001) that could well stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk of reaching poor outcomes (P < 0.001).

SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent for COVID-19, has infected over 50 million individuals' worldwide with more than â¼1 million fatalities. Autophagy modulators have emerged as potential therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2 but recent clinical setbacks urge for better understanding of viral subversion of autophagy. Using MHV-A59 as a model betacoronavirus, time-course infections revealed significant loss in the protein level of ULK1, a canonical autophagy-regulating kinase, and the concomitant appearance of a possible cleavage fragment. To investigate whether virus-encoded proteases target ULK1, we conducted in-vitro and cellular cleavage assays and identified ULK1 as a novel bona fide substrate of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro). Mutagenesis studies discovered that ULK1 is cleaved at a conserved PLpro recognition sequence (LGGG) after G499, separating its N-terminal kinase domain from a C-terminal substrate recognition region. Over-expression of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is sufficient to impair starvation-induced autophagy and disrupt formation of ULK1-ATG13 complex. Finally, we demonstrated a dual role for ULK1 in MHV-A59 replication, serving a pro-viral functions during early replication that is inactivated at late stages of infection. In conclusion, our study identified a new mechanism by which PLpro of betacoronaviruses induces viral pathogenesis by targeting cellular autophagy.","Mohamud, Yasir; Xue, Yuan Chao; Liu, Huitao; Ng, Chen Seng; Bahreyni, Amirhossein; Jan, Eric; Luo, Honglin",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,383

We sought to use wastewater-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 to assess the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals. Between August and December 2020, twice-weekly wastewater samples from three tertiary-care hospitals (totaling > 2100 dedicated inpatient beds) were collected. Hospital-1 and Hospital-2 could be captured with a single sampling point whereas Hospital-3 required three separate monitoring sites. Wastewater samples were concentrated and cleaned using the 4S-silica column method and assessed for SARS-CoV-2 gene-targets (N1, N2 and E) and controls using RT-qPCR. Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 as measured by quantification cycle (Cq), genome copies and genomes normalized to the fecal biomarker PMMoV were compared to the total daily number of patients hospitalized with active COVID-19, confirmed cases of hospital-acquired infection, and the occurrence of unit-specific outbreaks. Of 165 wastewater samples collected, 159 (96%) were assayable. The N1-gene from SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 64.1% of samples, N2 in 49.7% and E in 10%. N1 and N2 in wastewater increased over time both in terms of the amount of detectable virus and the proportion of samples that were positive, consistent with increasing hospitalizations at those sites with single monitoring points (Pearson's r = 0.679, P < 0.0001, Pearson's r = 0.799, P < 0.0001, respectively). Despite increasing hospitalizations through the study period, nosocomial-acquired cases of COVID-19 (Pearson's r = 0.389, P < 0.001) and unit-specific outbreaks were discernable with significant increases in detectable SARS-CoV-2 N1-RNA (median 112 copies/ml) versus outbreak-free periods (0 copies/ml; P < 0.0001). Wastewater-based monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 represents a promising tool for SARS-CoV-2 passive surveillance and case identification, containment, and mitigation in acute- care medical facilities.","Acosta, Nicole; Bautista, María A; Hollman, Jordan; McCalder, Janine; Beaudet, Alexander Buchner; Man, Lawrence; Waddell, Barbara J; Chen, Jianwei; Li, Carmen; Kuzma, Darina; Bhatnagar, Srijak; Leal, Jenine; Meddings, Jon; Hu, Jia; Cabaj, Jason L; Ruecker, Norma J; Naugler, Christopher; Pillai, Dylan R; Achari, Gopal; Ryan, M Cathryn; Conly, John M; Frankowski, Kevin; Hubert, Casey Rj; Parkins, Michael D",Water Res,,383

373635,Surgical Cases in the COVID-19 Era : An Early Institutional Experience,2020,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 remains an extant threat against public health on a global scale. Cell infection begins when the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds with the cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, we address the role of Tetracycline as an inhibitor for the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Targeted molecular investigation show that Tetracycline binds more favorably to the RBD (-9.40 kcal/mol) compared to Chloroquine (-6.31 kcal/mol) or Doxycycline (-8.08 kcal/mol) and inhibits attachment to ACE2 to a greater degree (binding efficiency of 2.98 $\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{nm}^2}$ for Tetracycline-RBD, 5.59 $\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{nm}^2}$ for Chloroquine-RBD, 5.16 $\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{nm}^2}$ for Doxycycline-RBD). Stronger Tetracycline inhibition is verified with nonequilibrium PMF calculations, for which the Tetracycline-RBD complex exhibits the lowest free energy profile along the dissociation pathway from ACE2. Tetracycline appears to target viral residues that are usually involved in significant hydrogen bonding with ACE2; this inhibition of cellular infection complements the anti-inflammatory and cytokine suppressing capability of Tetracycline, and may further reduce the duration of ICU stays and mechanical ventilation induced by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.","Zhao, Tom Y.; Patankar, Neelesh A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06034v1.pdf,383

374440,“Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR)” Status Determines Mortality in Patients with COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the management of systemic immunosuppressive treatments for rheumatic conditions. It is well known that rheumatic patients are at risk of developing infections because of their immunocompromised state. Moreover, drugs such as hydroxychloroquine or tocilizumab that are widely used to treat rheumatic diseases are now being used to treat COVID-19. The aim of this multicentre retrospective study of rheumatic patients in the Italian regions of Lombardy and Marche was to determine whether patients receiving biological or small molecules treatment are more susceptible to the development of COVID-19 than the general population. METHODS: The local registry data of 10,260 rheumatic patients being treated with bDMARDs or small molecules were evaluated from 15 March to 23 April 2020. The final analysis was based on the registry data relating to 7.204, telephone contacts and/or outpatient visits. RESULTS: Forty-seven of the 7.204 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, seven of whom died; the patients who had symptoms resembling those of COVID-19 but had negative swabs were considered negative for the disease. The overall infection rate was 0.65, and the crude case fatality risk (CFR) in the patients with COVID-19 was 14.9%. There was no difference in the mortality rate among the patients receiving the different individual biological drugs or small molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the susceptibility of rheumatic patients to COVID-19 is the same as that of the general population, but confirm that age, disease duration, and the number of co-morbidities are associated with an increased risk of a severe form of the disease. It seems that immunosuppressants drugs do not effectively represent a risk factor for COVID- 19.","Sarzi-Puttini, Piercarlo; Marotto, Daniela; Caporali, Roberto; Montecucco, Carlo Maurizio; Favalli, Ennio Giulio; Franceschini, Franco; Fredi, Michela; Balduzzi, Silvia; Bazzani, Chiara; Bongiovanni, Sara; Giorgi, Valeria; Batticciotto, Alberto; Cappelli, Antonella; Balzarini, Patrizia; Dagna, Lorenzo; Sartorelli, Silvia; Ravagnani, Viviana; Tamanini, Silvia; Farah, Sonia; Faggioli, Paola; Castelnovo, Laura; Lurati, Alfredo Maria; Galli, Massimo; Salaffi, Fausto",J Autoimmun,,383

Rapid and ease-to-use diagnostic techniques are urgently needed to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We devised a reverse transcription multiple cross displacement amplification (RT-MCDA) coupled with nanoparticles-based biosensor (BS) assay (RT-MCDA-BS) for rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis of COVID-19. Two primer sets were designed to target the open reading frame 1a/b (F1ab) and nucleoprotein gene (N) of SARS-CoV-2. A total of 183 clinical samples, including 65 patients with COVID-19 infections and 118 patients with other pathogen infections, were used to testify the assay's feasibility. The diagnosis results were visually reported using BS. FINDINGS: The designed assay was performed using a simple instrument which could maintain the reaction in a constant temperature at 64°C for only 35â min. The total procedure of COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS test could be finished within 1â h. The COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS could detect down to 5 copies of target sequences. Among 65 clinical samples from the COVID-19 patients, 22 (33.8%) positive results were obtained from face, nasal, pharyngeal and anal swabs via COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS assay, while rRT-PCR assay only detected 20 (30.7%) positive results in these samples. No positive results were obtained from clinical samples with non-COVID-19 infections. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS was a rapid, reliable, low cost and easy-to-use assay, which could provide an attractive laboratory tool to diagnose COVID-19 in multiple clinical specimens, especially for field, clinic laboratories and primary care facilities in resource-poor settings.","Li, Shijun; Jiang, Weijia; Huang, Junfei; Liu, Ying; Ren, Lijuan; Zhuang, Li; Zheng, Qinni; Wang, Ming; Yang, Rui; Zeng, Yi; Wang, Yi",Eur. respir. j,,383
375520,Raising the threshold for hospital admission and endoscopy in upper gastrointestinal bleeding during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"In this analysis we discuss the change in criteria for triage of patients during three different phases of a pandemic like COVID-19, seen from the critical care point of view. Availability of critical care beds has become a hot topic, and in many countries, we have seen a huge increase in the provision of temporary intensive care bed capacity. However, there is a limit where the hospitals may run out of resources to provide critical care, which is heavily dependent on trained staff, just-in-time supply chains for clinical consumables and drugs and advanced equipment. In the first (good) phase, we can still do clinical prioritisation and decision-making as usual, based on the need for intensive care and prognostication: what are the odds for a good result with regard to survival and quality of life. In the next (bad phase), the resources are mostly available, but the system is stressed by many patients arriving over a short time period and auxiliary beds in different places in the hospital being used. We may have to abandon admittance of patients with doubtful prognosis. In the last (ugly) phase, usual medical triage and priority setting may not be sufficient to decrease inflow and there may not be enough intensive care unit beds available. In this phase different criteria must be applied using a utilitarian approach for triage. We argue that this is an important transition where society, and not physicians, must provide guidance to support triage that is no longer based on medical priorities alone.","Flaatten, Hans; Van Heerden, Vernon; Jung, Christian; Beil, Michael; Leaver, Susannah; Rhodes, Andrew; Guidet, Bertrand; deLange, Dylan W",J. med. ethics,,383

Additionally, most methods utilized small wastewater volumes and the primary concentration methods used were polyethylene glycol precipitation, membrane filtration and centrifugal ultrafiltration followed by nucleic acid extraction and assay for primarily nucleocapsid gene targets (N1, N2, and/or N3). Since this survey was performed, many laboratories have continued to optimize and implement a variety of methods for SARS-CoV-2 WBE.

METHODS: The hospital staffs recovered from COVID-19 were included. The candidates who had an ear disease or progressive hearing loss prior to COVID-19, or having been hospitalised because of severe and critical COVID-19 were excluded. The age, sex, symptoms during COVID-19, and medications received for the disease were noted. The hearing thresholds (HT) of the participants who had an audiogram before having COVID-19 disease were recorded. A pure tone audiometry was conducted to all. The participants were classified into two groups; Group 1: participants who had an audiogram previously, Group 2: participants who didn't have an audiogram previously. The changes of the HTs of the participants in Group 1 were analyzed. The HTs of the participants in Group 2 were documented without any comparison. The HTs of all participants were also analyzed by classifying them into subgroups according to their symptoms during, and medications received for COVID-19. RESULTS: Fifty-four males and 47 females (18-59 years) were included. The participants' HTs in Group 1 (n = 31) did not change significantly at any of the frequencies after having COVID-19 (p > 0.05). The pure tone averages of the participants in Group 2 (n = 70) were below 25 dB and none of the participants reported worsening of their hearing permanently. The differences between the HTs of none of the subgroups were statistically significant (p > 0.05, p > 0.05).

Various PCR technology adaptations, typically using two-oligonucleotide dye-binding methods or three-oligonucleotide hydrolysis probe systems, enable real-time multiplex target detection or single-base specificity for the identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A small number of two-oligonucleotide PCR systems facilitating both multiplex detection and SNP identification have been reported; however, these methods often have limitations in terms of target specificity, production of variable or false-positive results, and the requirement for extensive optimisation or post-amplification analysis.

375661,Safety Profile of Treatments Administered in Covid 19 Infection in Pregnant Women,2021,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and consequent social distancing practices have disrupted essential clinical research functions worldwide. Ironically, this coincides with an immediate need for research to comprehend the biology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the pathology of COVID-19. As the global crisis has already led to over 15,000 deaths out of 175,000 confirmed cases in New York City and Nassau County, NY alone, it is increasingly urgent to collect patient biospecimens linked to active clinical follow up. However, building a COVID-19 biorepository amidst the active pandemic is a complex and delicate task. To help facilitate rapid, robust, and regulated research on this novel virus, we report on the successful model implemented by New York University Langone Health (NYULH) within days of outbreak in the most challenging hot spot of infection globally. Using an amended institutional biobanking protocol, these efforts led to accrual of 11,120 patients presenting for SARS-CoV-2 testing, 4267 (38.4%) of whom tested positive for COVID-19. The recently reported genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York City Region, which is a crucial development in tracing sources of infection and asymptomatic spread of the novel virus, is the first outcome of this effort. While this growing resource actively supports studies of the New York outbreak in real time, a worldwide effort is necessary to build a collective arsenal of research tools to deal with the global crisis now, and to exploit the virus's biology for translational innovation that outlasts humanity's current dilemma.","Osman, Iman; Cotzia, Paolo; Moran, Una; Donnelly, Douglas; Arguelles-Grande, Carolina; Mendoza, Sandra; Moreira, Andre",J Transl Med,,383
375839,Supportive care for oral cancer survivors in COVID-19 lockdown,2020,"Objective: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily causes respiratory illness. However, neurological sequelae from novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can occur. Patients with neurological conditions may be at higher risk of developing worsening of their underlying problem. Here we document our initial experiences as neurologic consultants at a single center quaternary hospital at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a retrospective case series of adult patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 who required neurological evaluation in the form of a consultation or primary neurological care from March 13, 2020 to April 1, 2020. Results: Thirty-three patients (ages 17–88 years) with COVID-19 infection who required neurological or admission to a primary neurology team were included in this study. The encountered neurological problems associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were encephalopathy (12 patients, 36.4%), seizure (9 patients, 27.2%), stroke (5 patients, 15.2%), recrudescence of prior neurological disease symptoms (4 patients, 12.1%), and neuromuscular (3 patients, 9.1%). The majority of patients who required evaluation by neurology had elevated inflammatory markers. Twenty-one (63.6%) patients were discharged from the hospital and 12 (36.4%) died from COVID-19 related complications. Conclusion: This small case series of our initial encounters with COVID-19 infection describes a range of neurological complications which are similar to presentations seen with other critical illnesses. COVID-19 infection did not change the overall management of neurological problems.","Radmard, Sara; Epstein, Samantha E.; Roeder, Hannah J.; Michalak, Andrew J.; Shapiro, Steven D.; Boehme, Amelia; Wilson, Tommy J.; Duran, Juan C.; Bain, Jennifer M.; Willey, Joshua Z.; Thakur, Kiran T.",Front.

Electronic databases (Pubmed, CENTRAL, EMBASE) were screened for studies. No language restrictions were applied. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were done in duplicate. Primary outcome included assessment of WSL with visual-tactile assessment and/or laser fluorescence measurements. Twenty-four studies with 1117 patients (age: 11-40 years) and 12,809 teeth were included. Overall, 34 different sealants or bonding materials were analysed. Fourteen studies analysed fluoride and 14 studies non-fluoride releasing materials. Meta-analysis for visual tactile assessment revealed that sealants significantly decreased the initiation of WSL compared to untreated control (RR [95%CI] = 0.70 [0.53; 0.93]; very low level of evidence). Materials releasing fluoride did not decrease initiation of WSL compared to those with no fluoride release (RR [95%CI] = 0.84 [0.70; 1.01]; very low level of evidence). For laser fluorescence measurements no meta-analysis could be performed. The use of sealants seems to be effective in preventing the initiation of post-orthodontic WSL. Furthermore, there is no evidence supporting that fluoride-releasing sealants or bonding materials are more effective than those without fluoride release. No gold standard prevention strategy to prevent WSL during treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances has been established yet. However, based on only a limited number of studies the use of sealants seems to be effective in preventing the initiation of post-orthodontic WSL.","Kamber, R; Meyer-Lueckel, H; Kloukos, D; Tennert, C; Wierichs, R J",Sci Rep,,383
376517,Impact of Covid-19 on Therapy Provision for Children with Cns Tumours,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic requires to conscientiously weigh ""timely surgical intervention"" for colorectal cancer against efforts to conserve hospital resources and protect patients and health care providers. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Professional societies provided ad-hoc guidance at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic on deferral of surgical and perioperative interventions, but these lack specific parameters to determine the optimal timing of surgery. METHODS: Using the GRADE system, published evidence was analyzed to generate weighted statements for stage, site, acuity of presentation, and hospital setting to specify when surgery should be pursued, the time and duration of oncologically acceptable delays, and when to utilize nonsurgical modalities to bridge the waiting period. RESULTS: Colorectal cancer surgeries-prioritized as emergency, urgent with imminent emergency or oncologically urgent, or elective-were matched against the phases of the pandemic. Surgery in COVID-19-positive patients must be avoided. Emergent and imminent emergent cases should mostly proceed unless resources are exhausted. Standard practices allow for postponement of elective cases and deferral to nonsurgical modalities of stage II/III rectal and metastatic colorectal cancer. Oncologically urgent cases may be delayed for 6(-12) weeks without jeopardizing oncological outcomes. Outside established principles, administration of nonsurgical modalities is not justified and increases the vulnerability of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed already limited health care resources and forced rationing, triage, and prioritization of care in general, specifically of surgical interventions. Established guidelines allow for modifications of optimal timing and type of surgery for colorectal cancer during an unrelated pandemic.","O039,; Leary, Michael P; Choong, Kevin C; Thornblade, Lucas W; Fakih, Marwan G; Fong, Yuman; Kaiser, Andreas M",Ann Surg,,383

The authors examined whether leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) shares genetic and environmental variances between spelling, essay writing, reading aloud, reading comprehension, and mathematics in early adolescence. Moreover, they investigated whether genetic polymorphisms associated with physical activity behavior affect these academic skills. METHODS: Participants were 12-year-old Finnish twins (n = 4356-4370 twins/academic skill, 49% girls). Academic skills were assessed by teachers, and LTPA was self-reported. Polygenic scores for physical activity behavior were constructed from the UK Biobank. Quantitative genetic modeling and linear regression models were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The trait correlations between LTPA and academic skills were significant but weak (r = .05-.08). The highest trait correlation was found between LTPA and mathematics. A significant genetic correlation was revealed between LTPA and essay writing (rA = .14). Regarding polygenic scores of physical activity, the highest correlations were found with reading comprehension, spelling, and essay writing, but these results only approached statistical significance (P values = .09-.15). CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results suggest that reading and writing are the academic skills that most likely share a common genetic background with LTPA.","Aaltonen, Sari; Palviainen, Teemu; Rose, Richard J; Kujala, Urho M; Kaprio, Jaakko; Silventoinen, Karri",J Phys Act Health,,383

377412,New Answers to Old questions: Wait List versus Transplant Outcomes in the COVID-19 Era,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with no specific drugs and high fatality. The most urgent need is to find effective treatments. We sought to determine whether hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) application may reduce the death risk of critically ill COVID-19 patients. In this retrospective study, we included 550 critically ill COVID-19 patients who need mechanical ventilation in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, from February 1, 2020 to April 4, 2020. All 550 patients received comparable basic treatments including antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and 48 of them were treated with oral HCQ treatment (200 mg twice a day for 7-10 days) in addition to the basic treatments. Primary endpoint is fatality of patients, and inflammatory cytokine levels were compared between HCQ and non-hydroxychloroquine (NHCQ) treatments. We found that fatalities are 18.8% (9/48) in HCQ group, which is significantly lower than 47.4% (238/502) in the NHCQ group (P<0.001). The time of hospital stay before patient death is 15 (10-21) days and 8 (4-14) days for the HCQ and NHCQ groups, respectively (P<0.05). The levels of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 were significantly reduced from 22.2 (8.3-118.9) pg mL-1 at the beginning of the treatment to 5.2 (3.0-23.4) pg mL-1 (P<0.05) at the end of the treatment in the HCQ group but there is no change in the NHCQ group. These data demonstrate that addition of HCQ on top of the basic treatments is highly effective in reducing the fatality of critically ill patients of COVID-19 through attenuation of inflammatory cytokine storm. Therefore, HCQ should be prescribed as a part of treatment for critically ill COVID-19 patients, with possible outcome of saving lives. hydroxychloroquine, IL-6, mortalities, COVID-19.","Yu, Bo; Li, Chenze; Chen, Peng; Zhou, Ning; Wang, Luyun; Li, Jia; Jiang, Hualiang; Wang, Dao-Wen","Sci.

379257,Systematic review of immunosuppressant guidelines in the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has been estimated using imported case counts of international travellers, generally under the assumptions that all cases of the disease in travellers have been ascertained and that infection prevalence in travellers and residents is the same. However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore. We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents. FINDINGS: The weighted global ability to detect Wuhan-to-location imported cases of COVID-19 was estimated to be 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22-64) of Singapore's capacity. This value is equivalent to 2·8 (95% HPDI 1·5-4·4) times the current number of imported and reported cases that could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22-67) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18-68) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0-42) among locations with low surveillance capacity. Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence. INTERPRETATION: Estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold. Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates. Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID-19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.

380188,Meeting the Challenge of COVID-19: The Response of Two Ethics Consultation Services in New York City,2020,"1.The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has had major impacts on childrens education, with schools required to implement infection control measures that have led to long periods of absence and classroom closures. We develop an agent-based epidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission that is applied to model infection within school classrooms, with a contact model constructed using random networks informed by structured expert judgement. Mitigation strategies to control infection are modelled to allow analysis of their effectiveness in supressing infection outbreaks and in limiting pupil absence. The model is applied to re-examine Covid-19 in schools in the UK in autumn 2020, and to forecast infection levels in autumn 2021 when the more infectious Delta-variant is dominant and school transmission is likely to play a major role in a new wave of the epidemic. Our results indicate that testing-based surveillance of infections in the classroom population with isolation of positive cases is a more effective mitigation measure than bubble quarantine both for reducing transmission in schools and for avoiding pupil absence, even accounting for insensitivity of self-administered tests. Bubble quarantine results in large numbers of pupils absent from school, with only modest impact of classroom infection. However, maintaining a reduced contact rate within the classroom has a major beneficial impact for managing Covid-19 in school settings.","Woodhouse, Mark J; Aspinall, Willy P; Sparks, Stephen RJ; quot, - CoMMinS prject; Schoolsquot, COVID-19 Mapping and Mitigation in",,,383

IL-6 is known to be modulated by Vitamin D, and there is preliminary evidence that deficiency of this vitamin is linked to poorer outcomes. To identify whether IL-6 levels prior to infection might predict outcome, early data on COVID-19 mortality from Italy and the UK were compared with previously published results of mean IL-6 levels from these countries as well as from the USA. There was a highly significant correlation (r = 0.9883; p = 0.00025) between age-stratified mortality rates and IL-6 levels from previously published data on healthy individuals. To determine whether Vitamin D may be beneficial at lowering IL-6 levels in patients, a limited analysis of trials examining the relationship between these entities published since 2015 was undertaken. Eight out of 11 studies described a significant lowering effect of Vitamin D on IL-6. Given that IL-6 likely facilitates viral cell entry and replication, levels prior to infection may predict mortality. This provides a rationale for prophylactic and therapeutic measures directed at lowering IL-6, including Vitamin D prescription.","Silberstein, Morry",Int Immunopharmacol,,383
380692,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on eye cancer care in United Kingdom,2021,"Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) is widely used to diagnose human pathogens. RT-PCR data are traditionally analyzed by estimating the threshold cycle (CT ) at which the fluorescence signal produced by emission of a probe crosses a baseline level. Current models used to estimate the CT value are based on approximations that do not adequately account for the stochastic variations of the fluorescence signal that is detected during RT-PCR. Less common deviations become more apparent as the sample size increases, as is the case in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this work, we employ a method independent of CT value to interpret RT-PCR data. In this novel approach, we built and trained a deep learning model, qPCRdeepNet, to analyze the fluorescent readings obtained during RT-PCR. We describe how this model can be deployed as a quality assurance tool to monitor result interpretation in real time. The model's performance with the TaqPath COVID19 Combo Kit assay, widely used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, is described. This model can be applied broadly for the primary interpretation of RT-PCR assays and potentially replace the CT interpretive paradigm.","Alouani, David J; Rajapaksha, Roshani R P; Jani, Mehul; Rhoads, Daniel D; Sadri, Navid",J. clin. microbiol,,383

This study examined the prevalence of psychological distress among smokers following the onset of the pandemic compared with previous years. Cross-sectional data came from a representative survey of smokers (18+) in England (n = 2,927) between April-July in 2016, 2017 and 2020. Logistic regressions estimated the associations between past-month distress across 2016/2017 and 2020, and age. Weighted proportions, chi-squared statistics and stratified logistic regression models were used to compare the distributions of moderate and severe distress, respectively, within socio-demographic and smoking characteristics in 2016/2017 and 2020. Between the combined April-July 2016 and 2017 sample and April-July 2020 the prevalence of moderate and severe distress among past-year smokers increased (2016/2017: moderate 20.66%, 19.02-22.43;severe 8.23%, 7.16-9.47;2020: moderate 28.79%, 95%CI 26.11-31.60;OR = 2.08, 95%CI 1.34-3.25;severe 11.04%, 9.30-13.12;OR = 2.16, 1.13-4.07). While there was no overall evidence of an interaction between time period and age, young (16-24 years) and middle-age groups (45-54 years) may have experienced greater increases in moderate distress and older age groups (65+ years) increases in severe distress. There were increases of moderate distress among more disadvantaged social grades and both moderate and severe distress among women and those with low cigarette addiction. Between April-July 2016/2017 and April-July 2020 in England there were increases in both moderate and severe distress among smokers.

As of May 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions of people with almost 300.000 deaths worldwide only within few months since its first case was reported. While this infection mostly results in mild diseases, the increasing number of severe cases and deaths cannot be overlooked. Due to its novelty, many facets of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are not well understood. This review presents updated knowledge on the key virus characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and critical notes in the pathogenesis of this viral infection in human that is currently proposed to largely involve various aspects of the host immune responses. While the immediate impact of viral infection in the target cells contributes to the development of the disease, the ability of the virus to modify the host responses may result in the dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses, which commonly manifest in the severe spectrum of the disease. Having deep understanding on this complex process is central for tailoring appropriate management for the infected patients as well as for developing effective preventive measures, most importantly vaccine, which is hoped to occur in the near future.","Dewi, Shinta Trilaksmi; Soebono, Hardyanto",Journal Of The Medical Sciences (Berkala Ilmu Kedokteran),,383

384442,Positron Emission Tomography Scan (PET/CT) During the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Case Series,2020,"This paper considers the covert identification problem in which a sender aims to reliably convey an identification (ID) message to a set of receivers via a binary-input discrete memoryless channel (BDMC), and simultaneously to guarantee that the communication is covert with respect to a warden who monitors the communication via another independent BDMC. We prove a square-root law for the covert identification problem. This states that an ID message of size \exp(\exp(\Theta(\sqrt{n}))) can be transmitted over n channel uses. We then characterize the exact pre-constant in the \Theta(.) notation. This constant is referred to as the covert identification capacity. We show that it equals the recently developed covert capacity in the standard covert communication problem, and somewhat surprisingly, the covert identification capacity can be achieved without any shared key between the sender and receivers. The achievability proof relies on a random coding argument with pulse-position modulation (PPM), coupled with a second stage which performs code refinements. The converse proof relies on an expurgation argument as well as results for channel resolvability with stringent input constraints.","Zhang, Qiaosheng; Tan, Vincent Y.

At admission, all had immunosuppression withdrawn and were started on methylprednisolone 16 mg/day, all but one was commenced on antiviral therapy and hydroxychloroquine with doses adjusted for kidney function. At baseline, all patients presented fever but only one complained of difficulty in breathing. Half of patients showed chest radiographic evidence of bilateral infiltrates while the other half showed unilateral changes or no infiltrates. During a median follow-up of seven days, 87% experienced a radiological progression and among those 73% required escalation of oxygen therapy. Six patients developed acute kidney injury with one requiring hemodialysis. Six of 12 patients were treated with tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the IL-6 receptor. Overall, five kidney transplant recipients died after a median period of 15 days [15-19] from symptom onset.

We aimed to determine the incidence, association, and risk factors associated with development of the post-COVID-19 syndrome. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study at Dhaka Medical College Hospital between June 01, 2020 and August 10, 2020. All the enrolled patients were followed up for a month after clinical improvement, which was defined according the World Health Organization and Bangladesh guidelines as normal body temperature for successive 3 days, significant improvement in respiratory symptoms (respiratory rate <25/breath/minute with no dyspnea), and oxygen saturation >93% without assisted oxygen inhalation. FINDINGS: Among the 400 recruited patients, 355 patients were analyzed. In total, 46% patients developed post-COVID-19 symptoms, with post-viral fatigue being the most prevalent symptom in 70% cases. The post-COVID-19 syndrome was associated with female gender (relative risk [RR]: 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.48, p = 0.03), those who required a prolonged time for clinical improvement (p<0.001), and those showing COVID-19 positivity after 14 days (RR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.00-1.19, p<0.001) of initial positivity. Patients with severe COVID-19 at presentation developed post-COVID-19 syndrome (p = 0.02). Patients with fever (RR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.05-2.27, p = 0.03), cough (RR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02-1.81, p = 0.04), respiratory distress (RR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.4-1.56, p = 0.001), and lethargy (RR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.06-1.35, p = 0.003) as the presenting features were associated with the development of the more susceptible to develop post COVID-19 syndrome than the others. Logistic regression analysis revealed female sex, respiratory distress, lethargy, and long duration of the disease as risk factors.

386193,Risk-Taking Behavior in Recovered COVID-19 Patients,2021,"STUDY QUESTION: How are progesterone (P4)-induced repetitive intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) signals (oscillations) in human sperm generated? SUMMARY ANSWER: P4-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations are generated in the flagellum by membrane potential (Vm)-sensitive Ca2+-influx through CatSper channels. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: A subset of human sperm display [Ca2+]i oscillations that regulate flagellar beating and acrosome reaction. Although pharmacological manipulations indicate involvement of stored Ca2+ in these oscillations, influx of extracellular Ca2+ is also required. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a laboratory study that used >20 sperm donors and involved more than 100 separate experiments and analysis of more than 1000 individual cells over a period of 2 years. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Semen donors and patients were recruited in accordance with local ethics approval from Birmingham University and Tayside ethics committees. [Ca2+]i responses and Vm of individual cells were examined by fluorescence imaging and whole-cell current clamp. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: P4-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations originated in the flagellum, spreading to the neck and head (latency of 1-2 s). K+-ionophore valinomycin (1 µM) was used to investigate the role of membrane potential (Vm). Direct assessment by whole-cell current-clamp confirmed that Vm in valinomycin-exposed cells was determined primarily by K+ equilibrium potential (EK) and was rapidly 'reset' upon manipulation of [K+]o. Pre-treatment of sperm with valinomycin ([K+]o = 5.4 mM) had no effect on the P4-induced [Ca2+] transient (P = 0.95; eight experiments), but application of valinomycin to P4-pretreated sperm suppressed activity in 82% of oscillating cells (n = 257; P = 5 × 10-55 compared to control) and significantly reduced both the amplitude and frequency of persisting oscillations (P = 0.0001). Upon valinomycin washout, oscillations re-started in most cells. When valinomycin was applied in saline with elevated [K+], the inhibitory effect of valinomycin was reduced and was dependent on EK (P = 10-25). Amplitude and frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations that persisted in the presence of valinomycin showed similar sensitivity to EK (P < 0.01). The CatSper inhibitor RU1968 (4.8 and 11 µM) caused immediate and reversible arrest of activity in 36% and 96% of oscillating cells, respectively (P < 10-10). Quinidine (300 µM) which blocks the sperm K+ current (IKsper) completely, inhibited [Ca2+]i oscillations. LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This was an in-vitro study and caution must be taken when extrapolating these results to in-vivo regulation of sperm. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: [Ca2+]i oscillations in human sperm are functionally important and their absence is associated with failed fertilisation at IVF. The data reported here provide new understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the regulation and generation (or failure) of these oscillations.

The second is a model that incorporates a time delay in infected persons, before transmission is possible. We apply both models to the COVID-19 epidemic in China.

Evolutionary analysis of data such as DNA sequences is highly important in biological studies. As alignment methods are ineffective for analyzing large-scale data due to their inherently high costs, alignment-free methods have recently attracted attention in the field of bioinformatics. In this paper, we introduce a new positional correlation natural vector (PCNV) method that involves converting a DNA sequence into an 18-dimensional numerical feature vector. Using frequency and position correlation to represent the nucleotide distribution, it is possible to obtain a PCNV for a DNA sequence. This new numerical vector design uses six suitable features to characterize the correlation among nucleotide positions in sequences. PCNV is also very easy to compute and can be used for rapid genome comparison. To test our novel method, we performed phylogenetic analysis with several viral and bacterial genome datasets with PCNV.

390239,Immunologic characteristics of acute COVID-19 in people with HIV,2020,"BACKGROUND: Gender imbalances in academia have been evident historically and persist today. For the past 60 years, we have witnessed the increase of participation of women in biomedical disciplines, showing that the gender gap is shrinking. However, preliminary evidence suggests that women, including female researchers, are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of unequal distribution of childcare, elderly care, and other kinds of domestic and emotional labor. Sudden lockdowns and abrupt shifts in daily routines have had disproportionate consequences on their productivity, which is reflected by a sudden drop in research output in biomedical research, consequently affecting the number of female authors of scientific publications. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate adverse effect on the productivity of female researchers in the biomedical field in terms of authorship of scientific publications. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational bibliometric study. We investigated the proportion of male and female researchers who published scientific papers during the COVID-19 pandemic, using bibliometric data from biomedical preprint servers and selected Springer-Nature journals. We used the ordinary least squares regression model to estimate the expected proportions over time by correcting for temporal trends. We also used a set of statistical methods, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and regression discontinuity design, to test the validity of the results. RESULTS: A total of 78,950 papers from the bioRxiv and medRxiv repositories and from 62 selected Springer-Nature journals by 346,354 unique authors were analyzed. The acquired data set consisted of papers that were published between January 1, 2019, and August 2, 2020. The proportion of female first authors publishing in the biomedical field during the pandemic dropped by 9.1%, on average, across disciplines (expected arithmetic mean yest=0.39; observed arithmetic mean y=0.35; standard error of the estimate, Sest=0.007; standard error of the observation, &#963;x=0.004). The impact was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19 research, where the proportion of female scientists in the first author position dropped by 28% (yest=0.39; y=0.28; Sest=0.007; &#963;x=0.007). When looking at the last authors, the proportion of women dropped by 7.9%, on average (yest=0.25; y=0.23; Sest=0.005; &#963;x=0.003), while the proportion of women writing about COVID-19 as the last author decreased by 18.8% (yest=0.25; y=0.21; Sest=0.005; &#963;x=0.007). Further, by geocoding authors' affiliations, we showed that the gender disparities became even more apparent when disaggregated by country, up to 35% in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings document a decrease in the number of publications by female authors in the biomedical field during the global pandemic. This effect was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19, indicating that women are producing fewer publications related to COVID-19 research. This sudden increase in the gender gap was persistent across the 10 countries with the highest number of researchers. These results should be used to inform the scientific community of this worrying trend in COVID-19 research and the disproportionate effect that the pandemic has had on female academics.","Muric, Goran; Lerman, Kristina; Ferrara, Emilio",J Med Internet Res,,383

METHODS: From April 4 to July 3, 2020, in a single university hospital in Denmark, all parturient women and their partners were invited to participate in the study, along with their newborns. Participating women and partners had a pharyngeal swab and a blood sample taken at admission; immediately after delivery, a blood sample was drawn from the umbilical cord. The swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction, and the blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Full medical history and obstetric and neonatal information were available. RESULTS: A total of 1,313 parturient women (72.5.% of all women admitted for delivery at the hospital in the study period), 1,188 partners, and 1,206 newborns participated in the study. The adjusted serologic prevalence was 2.6% in women and 3.5% in partners. Seventeen newborns had SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, and none had immunoglobulin M antibodies. No associations between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and obstetric or neonatal complications were found (eg, preterm birth, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, Apgar score, low birth weight, umbilical arterial pH, need for continuous positive airway pressure, or neonatal admission), but statistical power to detect such differences was low. Full serologic data from 1,051 families showed an absolute risk of maternal infection of 39% if the partner had antibodies. CONCLUSION: We found no association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and obstetric or neonatal complications. Sixty-seven percent of newborns delivered by mothers with antibodies had SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. A limitation of our study is that we lacked statistical power to detect small but potentially meaningful differences between those with and without evidence of infection.","Egerup, Pia; Fich Olsen, Line; Christiansen, Ann-Marie Hellerung; Westergaard, David; Severinsen, Elin Rosenbek; Hviid, Kathrine Vauvert Römmelmayer; Kolte, Astrid Marie; Boje, Amalie Dyhrberg; Bertelsen, Marie-Louise Mathilde Friis; Prætorius, Lisbeth; Zedeler, Anne; Nielsen, Josefine Reinhardt; Bang, Didi; Berntsen, Sine; Ethelberg-Findsen, Jeppe; Storm, Ditte Marie; Bello-Rodríguez, Judith; Ingham, Andreas; Ollé-López, Joaquim; Hoffmann, Eva R; Wilken-Jensen, Charlotte; Krebs, Lone; Jørgensen, Finn Stener; Westh, Henrik; Jørgensen, Henrik Løvendahl; la Cour Freiesleben, Nina; Nielsen, Henriette Svarre",Obstet. gynecol,,383

Preventive measures are the only ways to be protected from the disease and knowledge of the people about the preventive measures is a vital matter. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge of the general people in Rajshahi district, Bangladesh regarding the COVID-19 preventive measures. METHODOLOGY: This cross sectional study was conducted from March 10 to April 25, 2020. Data were collected with a semi-structured questionnaire from 436 adult respondents selected by using a mixed sampling technique. Frequency analysis, chi-square test, and logistic regression model were utilized in this study. SPSS (IBM, Version 22) was used for data analysis. 95% confidence interval and p-value = 0.05 were accepted for statistical significance. RESULTS: Only 21.6% of the respondents had good knowledge of the COVID-19 preventive measures. The highest 67.2% of them knew that washing hands with soap could prevent the disease, but contrarily, the highest 72.5% did not know that avoidance of touching mouth, nose, and eyes without washing hands was a preventive measure. Only 28.4% and 36.9% of the respondents knew that maintaining physical distancing and avoiding mass gatherings were measures of prevention of COVID-19 respectively. The younger age (&#8804;25 years), low family income (&#8804;15,000 Bangladeshi Taka (BDT), occupation others than business and service, and nuclear family had the lower odds of having no/less knowledge about the preventive measures.

HCV-negative young people who inject drugs (PWID) were enrolled into a prospective cohort (2003-2019) with quarterly study visits. We used Cox regression to estimate the independent association of recent housing status (housed vs. unhoused, housing stability, and housing trajectory) on HCV incidence. Among 712 participants, 245 incident HCV infections occurred over 963.8 person-years (py) (cumulative incidence 24.4/100 py). An inverse relationship between time housed and HCV incidence was observed (always unhoused 45.0/100 py, 95% confidence interval (CI) 37.1, 54.5; variably housed 18.0/100 py, 95% CI 15.0, 21.3; and always housed 7.0/100 py, 95% CI 3.0, 17.3). In Cox regression models controlling for confounders, those unhoused versus housed at baseline had a 1.9-fold increased infection risk (95% CI 1.4, 2.6). Those always unhoused versus always housed had a 1.5 times greater risk of HCV (95% CI 1.0, 2.3), and those spending a portion of time in stable housing a lower risk (adjusted relative hazard 0.05, 95% CI 0.3, 0.9) with a similar trend for those being housed for less time. Young adult PWID experiencing both recent and chronic states of being unhoused are at elevated risk for HCV infection. Importantly for this group of PWID, our findings indicate that some frequency of residential housing significantly reduces HCV infection risk.","Morris, Meghan D; Yen, Irene H; Shiboski, Steve; Evans, Jennifer L; Page, Kimberly",J. urban health,,383

Healthcare professionals treating the coronavirus patients grapple with a massive and unprecedented shortage of Facepiece Respirators (FPRs) and other personal protective equipment (PPE), which act as fundamental tools to protect the health of the medical staff treating the patients affected by the coronavirus. While many FPRs are designed to be disposable single-use devices, the development of sterilization strategies is necessary to circumvent future shortages. Here, we describe the development of a plasma-based method to sterilize PPE such as FPRs with ozone. The novel design uses a flow-through configuration where ozone directly flows through the fibers of the PPE through the maintenance of a pressure gradient. Canonical ozone-based methods place the mask into a sealed ozone-containing enclosure but lack pressurization to permeate the mask fibers. In this device, ozone is created through an atmospheric pressure Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) fed with compressed air. Due to limited supply and clinical need of FPRs, we demonstrated sterilization with surgical masks. We demonstrate rapid sterilization using E. coli as a model pathogen. A flow-through configuration enables a>400% improvement of the sterilization efficiency with respect to the canonical approach. This method has potential for a broad and cost-effective utilization. Using the power supply from a readily available plasma ball toy, a plastic box, a glass tube, steel mesh, and 3D printed components, we designed and tested an extremely affordable portable prototype system for rapid single mask sterilization which produced comparable results to its large high-cost equivalent.","Schwan, Joseph; Alva, Troy R.; Nava, Giorgio; Rodriguez, Carla Berrospe; Chartron, Justin W.; Morgan, Joshua; Mangolini, Lorenzo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09280v1.pdf,383

A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and gout presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia with progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. His hospital course was complicated by a large pericardial effusion; an emergent bedside transthoracic echocardiography was concerning for cardiac tamponade, so pericardiocentesis was performed. A workup with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed changes consistent with a diagnosis of CP. Viral and idiopathic aetiologies are the most common cause of CP in the developed world, with COVID-19 now a proposed predisposing viral illness. The virus induces systemic inflammation and pericardial changes that can lead to CP physiology. Imaging modalities including echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance play an integral role in confirming the diagnosis.","Beckerman, Jennifer Kate; Alarfaj, Mohammad; Tracy, Cynthia M; Faiwiszewski, Ariel D; Choi, Andrew D",BMJ case reports,,383

In particular, we define \emph{travel cadence} as a two-dimensional measure of inter-regional travel, and show that both dimensions modulate epidemic spread. This technical insight leads to policy recommendations, pointing to a family of simple policy trajectories that can effectively curb epidemic spread while maintaining a basic level of mobility.","Streitmatter, Lauren; Zhang, Peter",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00203v1.pdf,383

To mitigate spread, healthcare systems have been cohorting patients to limit contacts between uninfected patients and potentially infected patients or healthcare workers (HCWs). A major challenge in managing the pandemic is the presence of currently asymptomatic/presymptomatic individuals capable of transmitting the virus, who could introduce COVID-19 into uninfected cohorts. The optimal combination of personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and other approaches to prevent these events is unclear, especially in light of ongoing limited resources. METHODS: Using stochastic simulations with a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered dynamic model, we quantified and compared the impacts of PPE use, patient and HCWs surveillance testing and subcohorting strategies. RESULTS: In the base case without testing or PPE, the healthcare system was rapidly overwhelmed, and became a net contributor to the force of infection. We found that effective use of PPE by both HCWs and patients could prevent this scenario, while random testing of apparently asymptomatic/presymptomatic individuals on a weekly basis was less effective. We also found that even imperfect use of PPE could provide substantial protection by decreasing the force of infection. Importantly, we found that creating smaller patient/HCW-interaction subcohorts can provide additional resilience to outbreak development with limited resources. CONCLUSION: These findings reinforce the importance of ensuring adequate PPE supplies even in the absence of testing and provide support for strict subcohorting regimens to reduce outbreak potential in healthcare institutions.","Qiu, Xueting; Miller, Joel C; MacFadden, Derek R; Hanage, William P",BMJ Open,,383

Relentless efforts for the development of effective pharmaco-therapeutics are in progress but the respite is the development of effective vaccines. However, monotherapy might not always exhibit complete efficacy and may culminate in the rapid evolution of drug-resistant viral strains. Hence, simultaneous modulation of multiple druggable targets not only enhances therapeutic efficacy but also quell the prospects of mutant viruses. Currently, milk peptides have bloomed beyond just being a quintessential part of nutrition to prominent therapeutic implications in human health and diseases. Hence, we have focused on colostrum/milk peptides as they have already been acknowledged for their high potency, target specificity with significantly low or no side effects and bio-toleration.

Although COVID-19 seems to attack the musculoskeletal system (muscles and joints) in its infective and postinfective stage causing inflammatory arthritis, not much is known about the rheumatic manifestations of this infection. In this case series of 5 patients, we discuss the occurrence of bilaterally symmetrical polyarthritis in patients, previously free from any rheumatic disease, after encountering COVID-19 infection. The musculoskeletal manifestations in these patients phenotypically resembled rheumatoid arthritis. These patients were treated successfully with low-dose glucocorticoids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

400144,"Response to: Comment on ""Cancer Surgery During COVID-19 How We Move Forward""",2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is typically associated with severe respiratory distress and has claimed more than 525,000 lives already. The most fearful aspect is the unavailability of any concrete guidelines and treatment or protective strategies for reducing mortality or morbidity caused by this virus. Repurposing of drugs, antivirals, convalescent plasma and neutralizing antibodies are being considered for treatment but are still questionable in lieu of the conflicting data, study design and induction of secondary infections. Stem cell therapy has seen substantial advancements over the past decade for the treatment of various diseases including pulmonary disorders with severe complications similar to COVID-19. Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have received particular attention as a potential therapeutic modality for SARS-CoV2 infection due to their ability to inhibit cytokine storm, a hallmark of severe COVID-19. MSCs secretion of trophic factors and extracellular vesicles mediated intercellular signaling are considered as principal contributing factors for tissue recovery. Although, recent preliminary studies have established the safety and efficacy of these cells without any severe secondary complications in the treatment of SARS-CoV2 infection, the rational use of MSCs on a large scale would still require additional relevant clinical investigations and validation of postulated mechanisms of these cells. This review presents the current clinical findings and update on the potential use of stem cell therapy and its secretome in combating the symptoms associated with COVID-19.","Mahajan, Aditi; Bhattacharyya, Shalmoli",Biomed J,,383

401160,Factors associated with death in children with COVID-19 in Mexico,2020,"Coronaviruses have caused several zoonotic infections in the past two decades, leading to significant morbidity and mortality globally. Balanced regulation of cell death and inflammatory immune responses is essential to promote protection against coronavirus infection; however, the underlying mechanisms that control these processes remain to be resolved. Here we demonstrate that infection with the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and inflammatory cell death in the form of PANoptosis. Deleting NLRP3 inflammasome components or the downstream cell death executioner gasdermin D (GSDMD) led to an initial reduction in cell death followed by a robust increase in the incidence of caspase-8- and receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)-mediated inflammatory cell death after coronavirus infection. Additionally, loss of GSDMD promoted robust NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, the amounts of some cytokines released during coronavirus infection were significantly altered due to the absence of GSDMD. Altogether our findings show that inflammatory cell death is induced by coronavirus infection and that impaired NLRP3 inflammasome function or pyroptosis can lead to negative consequences for the host. These findings may have important implications for studies of coronavirus-induced disease.","Zheng, Min; Williams, Evan Peter; Malireddi, R K Subbarao; Karki, Rajendra; Banoth, Balaji; Burton, Amanda; Webby, Richard; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Jonsson, Colleen Beth; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi",J. biol. chem,,383

402644,The Efficacy of Convalescent Plasma Use in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is essential to viral replication and cleaves highly specific substrate sequences, making it an obvious target for inhibitor design. However, as for any virus, SARS-CoV-2 is subject to constant neutral drift and selection pressure, with new Mpro mutations arising over time. Identification and structural characterization of Mpro variants is thus critical for robust inhibitor design. Here we report sequence analysis, structure predictions, and molecular modeling for seventy-nine Mpro variants, constituting all clinically observed mutations in this protein as of April 29, 2020. Residue substitution is widely distributed, with some tendency toward larger and more hydrophobic residues. Modeling and protein structure network analysis suggest differences in cohesion and active site flexibility, revealing patterns in viral evolution that have relevance for drug discovery.","Cross, Thomas J; Takahashi, Gemma R; Diessner, Elizabeth M; Crosby, Marquise G; Farahmand, Vesta; Zhuang, Shannon; Butts, Carter T; Martin, Rachel W",Biochemistry,,383

404011,Increase in the number of Sjögren's syndrome cases in Brazil in the COVID-19 Era,2021,"Recombinant MrNV capsid protein has been shown to effectively deliver plasmid DNA and dsRNA into Sf9 insect cells and shrimp tissues. To extend its application to cancer cell-targeting drug delivery, we created three different types of chimeric MrNV virus-like particles (VLPs) (R-MrNV, I-MrNV, and E-MrNV) that have specificity toward the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a cancer cell biomarker, by incorporating the EGFR-specific GE11 peptide at 3 different locations within the host cell recognition site of the capsid. All three chimeric MrNV-VLPs preserved the ability to form a mulberry-like VLP structure and to encapsulate EGFP DNA plasmid with an efficiency comparable to that previously reported for normal MrNV (N-MrNV). Compared to N-MrNV, the chimeric R-MrNV and E-MrNV carrying the exposed GE-11 peptide showed a significantly enhanced binding and internalization abilities that were specific towards EGFR expression in colorectal cancer cells (SW480). Specific targeting of chimeric MrNV to EGFR was proven by both EGFR silencing with siRNA vector and a competition with excess GE-11 peptide as well as the use of EGFR-negative colorectal cells (SW620) and breast cancer cells (MCF7). We demonstrated here that both chimeric R-MrNV and E-MrNV could be used to encapsulate cargo such as exogenous DNA and deliver it specifically to EGFR-positive cells. Our study presents the potential use of surface-modified VLPs of shrimp virus origin as nanocontainers for targeted cancer drug delivery.","Grataitong, Khwanthana; Huault, Sébastien; Chotwiwatthanakun, Charoonroj; Jariyapong, Pitchanee; Thongsum, Orawan; Chawiwithaya, Chidchanok; Chakrabandhu, Krittalak; Hueber, Anne-Odile; Weerachatyanukul, Wattana",Sci Rep,,383

404734,Long-Term Hemodialysis during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and human infections have resulted in a global health emergency. Small animal models that reproduce key elements of SARS-CoV-2 human infections are needed to rigorously screen candidate drugs to mitigate severe disease and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We and others have reported that transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) viral receptor under the control of the Keratin 18 (K18) promoter develop severe and lethal respiratory disease subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 intranasal challenge. Here we report that some infected mice that survive challenge have residual pulmonary damages and persistent brain infection on day 28 post-infection despite the presence of anti-SARS-COV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Because of the hypersensitivity of K18-hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 and the propensity of virus to infect the brain, we sought to determine if anti-infective biologics could protect against disease in this model system. We demonstrate that anti-SARS-CoV-2 human convalescent plasma protects K18-hACE2 against severe disease. All control mice succumbed to disease by day 7; however, all treated mice survived infection without observable signs of disease. In marked contrast to control mice, viral antigen and lesions were reduced or absent from lungs and absent in brains of antibody-treated mice. Our findings support the use of K18-hACE2 mice for protective efficacy studies of anti-SARS-CoV-2 medical countermeasures (MCMs). They also support the use of this system to study SARS-CoV-2 persistence and host recovery.","Golden, Joseph W; Zeng, Xiankun; Cline, Curtis R; Garrison, Aura R; White, Lauren E; Fitzpatrick, Collin J; Kwilas, Steven A; Bowling, Philip A; Fiallos, Jimmy O; Moore, Joshua L; Sifford, Willie B; Ricks, Keersten M; Mucker, Eric M; Smith, Jeffrey M; Hooper, Jay W",J. gen. virol,,383
404735,Independent Oncology Practices in the COVID-19 Era-Does US Cancer Care Need a Bailout?,2020,"hen multiple mediators exist on the causal pathway from treatment to outcome, path analysis prevails for disentangling indirect effects along paths linking possibly several mediators. However, separately evaluating each indirect effect along different posited paths demands stringent assumptions, such as correctly specifying the mediators' causal structure, and no unobserved confounding among the mediators. These assumptions may be unfalsifiable in practice and, when they fail to hold, can result in misleading conclusions about the mediators. Nevertheless, these assumptions are avoidable when substantive interest is in inference about the indirect effects specific to each distinct mediator. In this article, we introduce a new definition of indirect effects called interventional indirect effects from the causal inference and epidemiology literature. Interventional indirect effects can be unbiasedly estimated without the assumptions above while retaining scientifically meaningful interpretations. We show that under a typical class of linear and additive mean models, estimators of interventional indirect effects adopt the same analytical form as prevalent product-of-coefficient estimators assuming a parallel mediator model. Prevalent estimators are therefore unbiased when estimating interventional indirect effects-even when there are unknown causal effects among the mediators-but require a different causal interpretation. When other mediators moderate the effect of each mediator on the outcome, and the mediators' covariance is affected by treatment, such an indirect effect due to the mediators' mutual dependence (on one another) cannot be attributed to any mediator alone. We exploit the proposed definitions of interventional indirect effects to develop novel estimators under such settings.

405584,Impact of COVID-19 on the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients followed by remote monitoring,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 has become an increasingly dangerous virus infecting 77.6 million people and resulting in over 2 million deaths in the last year. The spike glycoprotein plays an important role in the viral infection process by recognizing and binding to the ACE2 receptor in host's cells. Due to the importance of this protein, current research efforts are focused on mutations that impact viral infectivity. SARS-CoV-2 viruses with a spike mutation at position 614 were recently shown to be more infectious than their wild-type ancestor. The D614G substitution eliminates a hydrogen bond with a threonine residue (T859) in an adjacent protein chain, allowing the spike protein to assume more readily an open conformation. Since the open conformation mediates attachment to the ACE2 receptor, the D614G mutant causes higher infectivity than the wild-type spike protein. The main goal of this research was to create physical 3D printed models of the wild-type and mutant spike proteins to visualize the molecular changes caused by the D614G mutation. Structural analyses of the wild-type and the D614G spike mutant were performed using the Protein Data Bank files, 6vxx and 6xs6. To visualize the conformational changes caused by the D614G mutation, the protein structure alignments were performed using Pymol. A combined file containing the superimposed structures was imported into Jmol to create the scripts for model construction and 3D printing. A small protein model was built to describe the overall structure of the spike and the location of the amino acids linked to higher viral infectivity. An additional detailed model was constructed to illustrate the biochemical interactions at the mutation site. In this model, important amino acids such as Asp614, Ala647, and Thr859 are highlighted due to their role in hydrogen bonding and spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor. A magnetic piece was created to show the effects of the aspartic acid to glycine mutation at position 614. A Jmol tutorial was designed to complement the 3D models and assess students? learning of the structure and function of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This exercise will allow undergraduate students and faculty to visualize and better understand how single amino acid mutations can lead to changes in viral infectivity.","McDonald, Lauren Young Dean Hill Patricia Martinez-Vaz Betsy",The FASEB Journal,,383

This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number and severity of cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Japan. METHODS: Using claims data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, urgent cases of inpatients for CAP from 01 August 2018 to 30 July 2020 were included. The monthly ratios of inpatient cases were compared from August 2018 to July 2019 and August 2019 to July 2020 as a year-over-year comparison. These ratios were also compared according to the ""A-DROP"" severity score, and an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the monthly number of inpatient cases. RESULTS: This study included a total of 67,900 inpatient cases for CAP in 262 hospitals. During the COVID-19 pandemic (defined as the period between March and July 2020) the number of inpatient cases for CAP drastically decreased compared with the same period in the previous year (-48.1%), despite a temporary reduction in the number of other urgent admissions. The number of inpatient cases decreased according to the severity of pneumonia. Milder cases showed a greater decrease in the year-over-year ratio than severe ones: mild -55.2%, moderate -45.8%, severe -39.4%, and extremely severe -33.2%. The ITS analysis showed that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the monthly number of inpatient cases for CAP (estimated decrease: -1233 cases; 95% CI -521 to -1955). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a significant reduction in the number of inpatient cases for CAP during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The milder cases showed a greater decrease in the year-over-year ratio of the number of inpatient cases.","Nagano, Hiroyuki; Takada, Daisuke; Shin, Jung-Ho; Morishita, Tetsuji; Kunisawa, Susumu; Imanaka, Yuichi",Int J Infect Dis,,383

408271,The battle against covid-19: Where do we stand now?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The Stockholm region was the first area in Sweden to be hit by the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The national guidelines on the care of women with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 (detection with polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) recommend individualized antenatal care, mode of delivery based on obstetric considerations, and no routine separation of the mother and the newborn. Breastfeeding is encouraged, and although there is no specific recommendation regarding wearing a face mask to prevent viral transmission to the newborn while nursing, instructions are given to keep high hygiene standards. All studies based on cases tested on hospital admission will capture more women with pregnancy complications than in the general population. Our aim was to describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-positive women and their neonates, and to report short-term maternal and neonatal outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective case series with data from medical records including all test-positive women (n = 67) who gave birth to 68 neonates from 19 March to 26 April 2020 in Stockholm, Sweden. Means, proportions and percentages were calculated for clinical characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age was 32 years, 40% were nulliparous and 61% were overweight or obese. Further, 15% had diabetes and 21% a hypertensive disease. Seventy percent of the women had a vaginal birth. Preterm delivery occurred in 19% of the women. The preterm deliveries were mostly medically indicated, including two women who were delivered preterm due to severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), corresponding to 15% of the preterm births. Four women (6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit postpartum but there were no maternal deaths. There were two perinatal deaths (one stillbirth and one neonatal death). Three neonates were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 after birth. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series of 67 women testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic to manifest COVID-19 disease, few women presented with severe COVID-19 illness. The majority had a vaginal birth at term with a healthy neonate that was negative for SARS-CoV-2.","Remaeus, Katarina; Savchenko, Julia; Brismar Wendel, Sophia; Brusell Gidlöf, Sebastian; Graner, Sophie; Jones, Elin; Molin, Johanna; Saltvedt, Sissel; Wallström, Tove; Pettersson, Karin",Acta obstet. gynecol. scand,,383

409075,Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for cancer in Spain,2020,"AIMS: The recent coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak forced the adoption of restraint measures, which modified the hospital admission patterns for several diseases. The aim of the study is to investigate the rate of hospital admissions for heart failure (HF) during the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, compared with a corresponding period during the previous year and an earlier period during the same year. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective analysis on HF admissions number at eight hospitals in Italy throughout the study period (21 February to 31 March 2020), compared with an inter-year period (21 February to 31 March 2019) and an intra-year period (1 January to 20 February 2020). The primary outcome was the overall rate of hospital admissions for HF. A total of 505 HF patients were included in this survey: 112 during the case period, 201 during intra-year period, and 192 during inter-year period. The mean admission rate during the case period was 2.80 admissions per day, significantly lower compared with intra-year period (3.94 admissions per day; incidence rate ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.89; P = 0.0037), or with inter-year (4.92 admissions per day; incidence rate ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.72; P < 0.001). Patients admitted during study period were less frequently admitted in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II compared with inter-year period (P = 0.019). At covariance analysis NYHA class was significantly lower in patients admitted during inter-year control period, compared with patients admitted during case period (P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Admissions for HF were significantly reduced during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.","Severino, Paolo; D039,; Amato, Andrea; Saglietto, Andrea; Ascenzo, Fabrizio; Marini, Claudia; Schiavone, Marco; Ghionzoli, Nicolò; Pirrotta, Filippo; Troiano, Francesca; Cannillo, Margherita; Mennuni, Marco; Rognoni, Andrea; Rametta, Francesco; Galluzzo, Alessandro; Agnes, Gianluca; Infusino, Fabio; Pucci, Mariateresa; Lavalle, Carlo; Cacciotti, Luca; Mather, Paul J; Grosso Marra, Walter; Ugo, Fabrizio; Forleo, Giovanni; Viecca, Maurizio; Morici, Nuccia; Patti, Giuseppe; De Ferrari, Gaetano M; Palazzuoli, Alberto; Mancone, Massimo; Fedele, Francesco",ESC Heart Fail,,383

As in other countries of the world, public authorities in Turkey are implementing many preventive and mitigating partial lockdown (PL) actions against the virus's effects. Some decisions and policies implemented before and after March 11, 2020, when the first virus case has been identified, have reduced people and traffic circulation, which has also turned into some improvements in air quality. At this point, this study aims to investigate how this pandemic affects the air quality of a metropolis. A case study of the city of Istanbul, the most affected city with more than half of Turkey's cases, is performed. In our analysis, we observe, compare, and discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and PL decisions on Istanbul city's air quality. We consider the particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxide (NO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and ozone (O3) concentrations. We used data from 19 air monitoring stations (AMSs) and obtained improvements in the air quality for the pandemic period. In summary, the concentration levels in PM10, NO2, NO, and NOx result in a clear decline in pandemic times compared to the normal times in Istanbul. On the other hand, a non-homogenous trend for SO2 and CO concentrations is observed for different AMSs. A partial increase in O2 concentration is obtained in the comparison of before and during the PL period.","Celik, Erkan; Gul, Muhammet",Environ Dev Sustain,,383

414338,"Reply to: ""Various forms of skin rash in COVID-19: Petechial rash in a patient with COVID-19 infection""",2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, when facing extraordinary infection prevention challenges, acute care settings have balanced routine patient safety needs while minimizing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission risk to patients and healthcare personnel (HCP). Mitigation strategies in acute care settings are based on a combination of basic science, environmental, and epidemiologic evidence. Here, we review the literature on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, how it has shaped infection prevention interventions in acute care settings, and the results of such measures to reduce transmission. RECENT FINDINGS: HCP adherence to transmission-based precautions in acute care settings, such as the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), is essential to mitigating SARS-CoV-2 spread. Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in nonrespiratory body sites, such exposure has not been shown to definitively cause transmission in humans. Epidemiologic evidence has demonstrated that implementation and adherence to infection prevention strategies reduces acute setting transmission. SUMMARY: Given SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs primarily through respiratory transmission, preventing HCP acquisition requires fidelity to consistent PPE usage. Infection prevention strategies and implementation of transmission-based precautions have reduced spread and outbreaks. Epidemiologic studies of acute care outbreaks often include reports of PPE nonadherence and community exposure contributing to SARS-CoV-2 transmission within this setting.","Yen, Christina F; van den Berg, Polly; Pepe, Dana E",Curr Opin Infect Dis,,383

METHODS: We retrieved information from cumulative confirmed symptomatic cases and deaths from COVID-19 as of June 20, 2020, and data from most recent census and surveys of Mexico. A negative binomial regression model was adjusted, the dependent variable was the number of COVID-19 deaths, and the independent variables were the quintiles of the distribution of sociodemographic and health characteristics among the 2457 municipalities of Mexico. RESULTS: Factors associated with high MRs from COVID-19, relative to quintile 1, were diabetes and obesity prevalence, diabetes mortality rate, indigenous population, economically active population, density of economic units that operate essential activities, and population density. Among factors inversely associated with lower MRs from COVID-19 were high hypertension prevalence and houses without sewage drainage. We identified 1351 municipalities without confirmed COVID-19 deaths, of which, 202 had high and 82 very high expected COVID-19 mortality (mean = 8 and 13.8 deaths per 100,000, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study identified municipalities of Mexico that could lead to a high mortality scenario later in the epidemic and warns against premature easing of mobility restrictions and to reinforce strategies of prevention and control of outbreaks in communities vulnerable to COVID-19.","Contreras-Manzano, Alejandra; Guerrero-López, Carlos M; Aguerrebere, Mercedes; Sedas, Ana Cristina; Lamadrid-Figueroa, Héctor",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,383

Behaviours, such as hand hygiene, screening and cohorting of patients, and the appropriate use of antibiotics have long been recommended in surgery, but their implementation has often been patchy. METHODS: The current crisis presents an opportunity to learn about how to improve infection prevention and control and surveillance (IPCS) behaviours. The improvements made were mainly informal, quick and stemming from the frontline rather than originating from formal organizational structures. The adaptations made and the expertise acquired have the potential for triggering deeper learning and to create enduring improvements in the routine identification and management of infections relating to surgery. RESULTS: This paper aims to illustrate how adopting a human factors and ergonomics perspective can provide insights into how clinical work systems have been adapted and reconfigured in order to keep patients and staff safe. CONCLUSION: For achieving sustainable change in IPCS practices in surgery during COVID-19 and beyond we need to enhance organizational learning potentials.","Toccafondi, Giulio; Di Marzo, Francesco; Sartelli, Massimo; Sujan, Mark; Smyth, Molly; Bowie, Paul; Cardi, Martina; Cardi, Maurizio",Int J Qual Health Care,,383

However, ionizing radiation during CT studies causes concern for patients who require dynamic observation, as well as for examination of children and young people. For this retrospective study, we included 15 suspected for COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in April 2020, Russia. There were 4 adults with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations using MR-LUND PROTOCOL: Single-shot Fast Spin Echo (SSFSE), LAVA 3D and IDEAL 3D, Echo-planar imaging (EPI) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and Fast Spin Echo (FSE) T2 weighted imaging (T2WI). On T2WI changes were identified in 9 (60,0%) patients, on DWI - in 5 (33,3%) patients. In 5 (33,3%) patients lesions of the parenchyma were visualized on T2WI and DWI simultaneously. At the same time, 4 (26.7%) patients had changes in lung tissue only on T2WI. (P(McNemar) = 0,125; OR = 0,00 (95%); kappa = 0,500). In those patients who had CT scan, the changes were comparable to MRI. The results showed that in case of CT is not available, it is advisable to conduct a chest MRI for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Considering that T2WI is a fluid-sensitive sequence, if imaging for the lung infiltration is required, we can recommend the abbreviated MRI protocol consisting of T2 and T1 WI. These data may be applicable for interpreting other studies, such as thoracic spine MRI, detecting signs of viral pneumonia of asymptomatic patients. MRI can detect features of viral pneumonia.","Vasilev, Yu A; Sergunova, K A; Bazhin, A V; Masri, A G; Vasileva, Yu N; Semenov, D S; Kudryavtsev, N D; Panina, O Yu; Khoruzhaya, A N; Zinchenko, V V; Akhmad, E S; Petraikin, A V; Vladzymyrskyy, A V; Midaev, A V; Morozov, S P",Magn Reson Imaging,,383

Computerized tomography (CT) is one of the most effective tools for COVID-19 screening. Since some specific patterns such as bilateral, peripheral, and basal predominant ground-glass opacity, multifocal patchy consolidation, crazy-paving pattern with a peripheral distribution can be observed in CT images and these patterns have been declared as the findings of COVID-19 infection. For patient monitoring, diagnosis and segmentation of COVID-19, which spreads into the lung, expeditiously and accurately from CT, will provide vital information about the stage of the disease. In this work, we proposed a SegNet-based network using the attention gate (AG) mechanism for the automatic segmentation of COVID-19 regions in CT images. AGs can be easily integrated into standard convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures with a minimum computing load as well as increasing model precision and predictive accuracy. Besides, the success of the proposed network has been evaluated based on dice, Tversky, and focal Tversky loss functions to deal with low sensitivity arising from the small lesions. The experiments were carried out using a fivefold cross-validation technique on a COVID-19 CT segmentation database containing 473 CT images. The obtained sensitivity, specificity, and dice scores were reported as 92.73%, 99.51%, and 89.61%, respectively. The superiority of the proposed method has been highlighted by comparing with the results reported in previous studies and it is thought that it will be an auxiliary tool that accurately detects automatic COVID-19 regions from CT images.","Budak, Ümit; Çibuk, Musa; Cömert, Zafer; Sengür, Abdulkadir",J. digit. imaging,,383

418611,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on blood supplies and transfusion services in Eastern Mediterranean Region,2020,"By 2040, deaths from chronic viral hepatitis worldwide are projected to exceed those from human immunodeficiency virus infection, tuberculosis and malaria combined. The burden of this disease is predominantly carried by low-resource countries in Africa and Asia. In resource-rich countries, the epidemiological spread of viral hepatitis is partially driven by migrant movements from areas of high endemicity. In the last decade, Member States of the European Union and the European Economic Area have experienced an unprecedented influx of migrants, which has resulted in the polarization of political views about migration. In addition, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has worsened the economic and health conditions of migrants and contributed to hostility to ensuring their health rights. Moreover, the implementation of hostile laws in some host nations has increased the vulnerability of marginalized migrant subgroups, such as asylum seekers and undocumented individuals. These developments have complicated the historical challenge of identifying high-risk migrant groups for screening and treatment. However, if European countries can apply the simplified assessment tools and diagnostic tests for viral hepatitis that have been used for decentralized screening and monitoring in resource-poor countries, the uptake of care by migrants could be dramatically increased. Given the global calls for the elimination of viral hepatitis, European nations should recognize the importance of treating this vulnerable migrant population. Political and health strategies need to be adapted to meet this challenge and help eliminate viral hepatitis globally.","Kim, Jin Un; Ingiliz, Patrick; Shimakawa, Yusuke; Lemoine, Maud",Bull World Health Organ,,383

DESIGN: Retrospective single-center observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-one patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), at the Geriatrics department of a general hospital in Belgium. MEASUREMENTS: Frailty was graded according to the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Demographic, biochemical, and radiologic variables, comorbidities, symptoms, and treatment were extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Participants (N = 48 women, 59%) had a median age of 85 years (range 65-97 years) and a median CFS score of 7 (range 2-9); 42 (52%) were long-term care residents. Within 6 weeks, 18 patients died. Mortality was significantly but weakly associated with age (Spearman r = 0.241, P = .03) and CFS score (r = 0.282, P = .011), baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; r = 0.301, P = .009), lymphocyte count (r = -0.262, P = .02), and RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct, r = -0.285, P = .015). Mortality was not associated with long-term care residence, dementia, delirium, or polypharmacy. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, CFS, LDH, and RT-PCR Ct (but not age) remained independently associated with mortality. Both age and frailty had poor specificity to predict survival. A multivariable model combining age, CFS, LDH, and viral load significantly predicted survival. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Although their prognosis is worse, even the oldest and most severely frail patients may benefit from hospitalization for COVID-19, if sufficient resources are available.","De Smet, Robert; Mellaerts, Bea; Vandewinckele, Hannelore; Lybeert, Peter; Frans, Eric; Ombelet, Sara; Lemahieu, Wim; Symons, Rolf; Ho, Erwin; Frans, Johan; Smismans, Annick; Laurent, Michaël R",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,383

419282,New onset neurologic events in people with COVID-19 in 3 regions in China,2020,"Introduction Spontaneous pneumomediastinum, a rare condition in viral pneumonias, has been increasingly reported during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging literature suggests a higher incidence and mortality in COVID-19 patients with both a pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. Early recognition and understanding of these complications are necessary to improve outcomes. We present a case of an older man initially diagnosed with mild COVID-19 symptoms who quickly progressed with increasing oxygen levels found to have a small pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. Description A 77-year-old man with hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea on home continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, and diagnosis of mild COVID-19 via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 1-week prior, presented to the emergency department for worsening shortness of breath. He was found to have a temperature of 101.5°F, heart rate of 103bpm, stable blood pressure, respiratory rate of 25 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation of 70% on ambient air. He was placed on 15lpm mid-flow. Labs were significant for a white blood cell count of 14k/uL, hemoglobin 11.7g/dL, c-reactive protein 185 mg/L, pro- BNP of 637pg/mL, ferritin 802 ng/mL, lactic acid 2 mmol/L, procalcitonin of 0.84 ng/mL. He had a chest x-ray with bilateral perihilar and lower lobe infiltrates. He was started on dexamethasone, remdesivir, antibiotics, tocilizumab, and enoxaparin. His CPAP was held and continued on oxygen therapy. Discussion Pneumomediastinum, or air in the mediastinum, occurs through various etiologies categorized into secondary and spontaneous. Common secondary causes include blunt injuries by trauma, iatrogenic causes such as intubation, central lines, and chest operations, and finally, medical conditions such as interstitial lung disease, asthma, connective tissue disorders, and respiratory infections may be other causes (1). Several cases have been reported with spontaneous pneumomediastinum in patients with COVID-19, however, the exact etiology is unknown as none were placed on mechanical ventilation (2-5). One mechanism is likely due to the repetitive episodes of cough causing increased airway pressure leading to alveolar rupture in already extensively damaged alveoli and proximal gas leakage (2). Based on one autopsy report, there were findings of desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation indicating early acute respiratory distress syndrome (6). In another case series, barotrauma from higher PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) with the use of CPAP is potentially another mechanism (7). Careful consideration for these complications should occur in patients with progressive forms of COVID-19, ensuring cough suppression, use of anti-emetics, diuretics and low PEEP strategy to help mitigate this previously rare phenomenon.","Sahu, N.; Roy, J.; Ernst, E.; Zamir, A.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,383
419405,A study to assess the level of knowledge and level of anxiety on coronavirus disease 2019 among adults living in Adukkamparai,2020,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with the novel, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), transplant medicine also had to face a new, hitherto unknown challenge. To be prepared for any possibility, we consider it important to summarize the current knowledge regarding COVID-19 of liver and kidney transplant patients. Very early reports from Spanish and French registry recorded fatality rates of 18.6% and 13%, respectively, in renal patients which suggests a moderately worse outcome compared to the general population. In patients with positive PCR test but not showing clinical signs, the reduction of immunosuppression is not advised. In the case of gastrointestinal or respiratory signs with fever, the discontinuation of mycophenolate or mTOR inhibitors is recommended with decrease of the trough levels of calcineurin inhibitors to the lowest effective limit. Stop (kidney transplanted patients) or decrease (liver transplanted patients) immunosuppression and maintain corticosteroids when pulmonal injury develops and consider anti-IL1 and anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody use when hyperinflammatory syndrome is evolving. No proven effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 exists currently. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir should be avoided because of the severe drug interaction with calcineurin inhibitors. The efficacy and tolerability of hidroxychloroquin remains to be also questionable; enroll patients into clinical trial with remdesivir or favipiravir if available. COVID-19 is characterized by virus-induced endothelial dysfunction, procoagulant state and renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system imbalance. Early thromboprofilaxis combination with low-molecular-weight heparin and low-dose aspirin is strongly recommended with the maintenance of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin-II-receptor blocker (ARB) therapy when they were prescribed earlier.

420002,Implementing Physical Distancing in the Hospital: A Key Strategy to Prevent Nosocomial Transmission of COVID-19,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) first discovered in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 has infected several millions of people, resulting in a huge socioeconomic cost and over 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Though the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not fully understood, data have consistently shown that SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence has implicated the central nervous system in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unfortunately, however, the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced impairment of the central nervous system are not completely known. Here, we review the literature on possible neuropathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced cerebral damage. The results suggest that downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with increased activity of the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L in SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion may result in upregulation of proinflammatory mediators and reactive species that trigger neuroinflammatory response and blood brain barrier disruption. Furthermore, dysregulation of hormone and neurotransmitter signalling may constitute a fundamental mechanism involved in the neuropathogenic sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The viral RNA or antigenic peptides also activate or interact with molecular signalling pathways mediated by pattern recognition receptors (e.g., toll-like receptors), nuclear factor kappa B, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, complement cascades, and cell suicide molecules. Potential molecular targets and therapeutics of SARS-CoV-2 induced neurologic damage are also discussed.","Welcome, Menizibeya O; Mastorakis, Nikos E",Inflammopharmacology,,383

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is necessitating the suspension or dramatic reduction of face-to-face non-urgent elective services, including OED clinics. Little is known regarding the potential impact of elective services suspension upon the risk of OED progression, and whether alternative strategies (e.g. remote consultations) may be introduced to ensure OED surveillance. The aim of this paper is to provide expert-opinion consensus recommendations for the management of OED during the current and future pandemic outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A working group of nine UK-based senior clinicians and academics in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Oral Medicine was created and twelve consensus statements were developed using a modified-Delphi process. Greater than 80% agreement was considered a consensus. RESULTS: Consensus was achieved for all twelve statements (89-100% agreement). The group agreed that, during the temporary suspension of elective services associated with COVID-19 pandemic outbreaks, patients with OED can be risk stratified to determine the length of accepted delay in face-to-face consultation. Remote consultations with patient-provided clinical photographs may be a useful way of maintaining a level of surveillance in this group of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Using an expert working group methodology, we have developed consensus recommendations for the monitoring of individuals with OED during pandemic outbreaks associated with temporary suspension of elective services. This has identified areas of future research and highlighted the need for a stronger evidence base to inform the set-up and delivery of surveillance regimens for patients with OED.","McCarthy, Caroline Elizabeth; Fedele, Stefano; Ho, Michael; Shaw, Richard",Oral Oncol,,383

Our study sought to compare disease severity measures for patients in Ireland hospitalised with COVID-19 against those hospitalised with seasonal influenza. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective population-based cohort study. METHODS: COVID-19 hospital episodes and seasonal influenza hospital episodes were identified using relevant International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes from the Irish national hospitalisation dataset. The occurrences of key metrics of disease severity, length of stay, intensive care admission, ventilatory support, haemodialysis and in-hospital mortality were measured and compared between the two groups using odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), stratified by age. RESULTS: Hospitalised COVID-19 episodes had a mean length of stay more than twice as long as hospitalised influenza episodes (17.7 days vs 8.3 days). The likelihood of all measures of disease severity was greater in COVID-19 episodes, and the odds of in-hospital mortality were five-fold higher in this group compared with seasonal influenza episodes (OR 5.07, 95% CI 4.29-5.99, P < 0.001). Greater likelihood of increased disease severity was observed for COVID-19 episodes in most age groups. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a more severe illness than seasonal influenza in hospitalised cohorts. It is imperative that public health professionals ensure that evidence-based advocacy is part of the response to COVID-19 to tackle a dangerous ""infodemic"" that can undermine public health control measures.","Beatty, K; Hamilton, V; Kavanagh, P M",Public Health,,383
424117,"Assess, adapt and act: a paediatric surgery division's initial approach in a rapidly evolving pandemic",2020,"Flexibility regarding where and when work is completed is becoming increasingly available to employees, especially following the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent shift in the nature of work. There is a plethora of research linking various flexible work arrangements (FWA) to a variety of positive outcomes across domains including reduced work–family conflict, better psychological health, and increased role satisfaction. While several studies have suggested that FWA are related to positive health, others have found no relationship between flexible work arrangements and health outcomes. To clarify these inconsistent findings, the current meta-analytic review (k = 33, n = 90,602) examines the relationship between flexible work arrangements available to employees and health behaviours and outcomes, specifically physical health, absenteeism, somatic symptoms, and physical activity. Results demonstrate that FWA are associated with better physical health, reduced absenteeism, and fewer somatic symptoms, suggesting that flexible work arrangements can facilitate employees in maintaining their health. There was no association between FWA and physical activity, though these results should be interpreted cautiously given the limited number of primary studies examining this relationship. These findings hold implications for future research and practice, including support for offering individualised flexible work arrangements as means of promoting employee health.

424549,Role of interleukin 6 as a predictive factor for a severe course of Covid-19: retrospective data analysis of patients from a long-term care facility during Covid-19 outbreak,2021,"Summar y. The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19, an outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, an important pathogen for humans. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus containing 29891 nucleotides encoding 9889 amino acids. The genome is arranged as 5p-replicase (orf1/ab)-structural proteins [Spike (S) -Envelope (E) - Membrane (M) -Nucleocapsid (N)] -3. Viruses are obligate intracellular infectious agents that use the host cellular machinery to ensure their own fitness and survival. MicroRNAs (miRNA9) systems are potent post-transcriptional gene expression regulators that are important modulators of viral infections, and could play an important role in the treatment of viral infections. This review focuses to the genomic structure of coronaviruses, the functions of genomic proteins, the effects of micro RNA (miRNA) on virus replication and its pathogenesis.","Canatan, Duran; De Sanctis, Vincenzo",Acta Biomed,,383

Multiple studies have investigated the immune responses to COVID-19 in various populations, including those without evidence of COVID-19 infection. Information regarding innate and adaptive immune responses to the novel severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved rapidly. Data are accumulating defining disease phenotypes that aid in rational and informed development of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the development of novel vaccines. In this paper, data on important innate immune responses are summarized, including cytokines, specifically interleukin (IL)-6 and complement, and potential treatments are explored. Adaptive immune responses and derivative therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies directed at spike proteins are also examined. Finally, data on real-time assessments of adaptive immune responses are explored, which include CD4+ /CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) T cells, memory B cells and T follicular cells with specificities for COVID-19 peptides in infected and normal individuals. Data of two novel vaccines have been released, both showing > 95% efficacy in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of humoral and cellular responses to the vaccines will determine the robustness and durability of protection. In addition, long-term assessment of SARS-CoV-2 memory B and T cell-mediated immune responses in patients recovering from an infection or those with cross-reactive immunological memory will help to define risk for future SARS-CoV infections. Finally, patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection may experience prolonged immune activation probably due to T cell exhaustion. This will be an important new frontier for study.","Jordan, S C",Clin. exp. immunol,,383

426215,High-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a factor affecting virus clearance in covid-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Cross-sectional studies have provided variable rates of seroprevalence in HCWs. Longitudinal assessments of the serological response to Covid-19 among HCWs are crucial to understanding the risk of infection and changes in antibody titers over time. We aimed to investigate seroprevalence and risk factors associated with seroconversion in a prospective cohort of HCWs during the peak of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study among 446 front-line HCWsin a tertiary-care hospital in Chile from April to July 2020. IgG was determined monthly using two different ELISAs in serum samples of HCWs, during the three-month period. In each visit, demographic data, symptoms, risk factors, and exposure risks were also assessed. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence at the end of the study period was 24% (95% CI20.2-28.3), with 43% of seropositive HCWs reporting no prior symptoms. Seroconversion rates significantly differed over the study period, from 2.1% to as high as 8.8% at the peak of the epidemic. There were no statistically significant differences observed between HCWs in direct clinical care of patients with Covid-19 and those working in low risk areas. Antibody titers appeared to wane over time. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs were severely affected with a high rate of seroconversion that appeared to mirror the local epidemiological situation. A significant amount of participants underwent an asymptomatic infection, highlighting the need for improved surveillance policies. Antibody titers appear to wane over time; further studies to understand this finding's impact on the risk of reinfection are warranted.","Iruretagoyena, Mirentxu; Vial, Macarena R; Spencer-Sandino, Maria; Gaete, Pablo; Peters, Anne; Delgado, Iris; Perez, Inia; Calderon, Claudia; Porte, Lorena; Legarraga, Paulette; Anderson, Alicia; Aguilera, Ximena; Vial, Pablo; Weitzel, Thomas; Munita, Jose M",BMC Infect Dis,,383

Methods : Written reports on the life impacts of COVID-19 for parents (n=56) and their children (n=43), and a questionnaire assessing parent positive and negative affect, were collected between April and May 2020. An inductive approach was used to identify themes in written reports, followed by statistical analysis to explore associations between themes and changes in parent positive and negative affect pre- and post-writing. Results : Parents and children reported both positive and negative psychosocial impacts of the virus, though parents expressed a greater diversity of positive themes than children. Common themes reported by parents included concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their children, health concerns for others, and the stressful balancing act of parenting, assisting with children's school work, and working from home. Many parents reported gratitude, and reflected on the upsides of the pandemic for family relationships and parent-child bonding. Parents who expressed gratitude reported a decrease in negative affect pre- to post-writing. Common child-reported themes included yearning to return to school, pandemic-related fears, and longing for social connection. Limitations : The sample included a cross-section of mostly White (non-Hispanic), dual income, well-educated mothers, primarily from the United States. Conclusions : Both parents and children reported reduced wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research should focus on identifying how to fulfill children's social needs and lessen caregivers’ burdens during this time.","Chu, Kristen Schwartz Chloe Towner Emily Kasparian Nadine A.; Callaghan, Bridget",Journal of Affective Disorders Reports,,383

A latent class model classified 24% of participants as non-responders not developing anti-spike antibodies. These seronegative non-responders were older, had higher SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold values during infection (i.e. lower viral burden), and less frequently reported any symptoms. Among those who seroconverted, using Bayesian linear mixed models, the estimated anti-spike IgG peak level was 7.3-fold higher than the level previously associated with 50% protection against reinfection, with higher peak levels in older participants and those of non-white ethnicity. The estimated anti-spike IgG half-life was 184 days, being longer in females and those of white ethnicity. We estimated antibody levels associated with protection against reinfection likely last 1.5-2 years on average, with levels associated with protection from severe infection present for several years. These estimates could inform planning for vaccination booster strategies.","Wei, Jia; Matthews, Philippa C; Stoesser, Nicole; Maddox, Thomas; Lorenzi, Luke; Studley, Ruth; Bell, John I; Newton, John N; Farrar, Jeremy; Diamond, Ian; Rourke, Emma; Howarth, Alison; Marsden, Brian D; Hoosdally, Sarah; Jones, E Yvonne; Stuart, David I; Crook, Derrick W; Peto, Tim E.A.; Pouwels, Koen B.; Walker, A.

432484,COVID-19 in Pediatrics: a Diagnostic Challenge,2021,"OBJECTIVES: 1.5 million people in the UK have mild to moderate learning disabilities. STIs and bloodborne viruses (BBVs) are over-represented in people experiencing broader health inequalities, which include those with mild learning disabilities. Self-managed care, including self-sampling for STIs/BBVs, is increasingly commonplace, requiring agency and health literacy. To inform the development of a partner notification trial, we explored barriers and facilitators to correct use of an STI/BBV self-sampling pack among people with mild learning disabilities. METHODS: Using purposive and convenience sampling we conducted four interviews and five gender-specific focus groups with 25 people (13 women, 12 men) with mild learning disabilities (July-August 2018) in Scotland. We balanced deductive and inductive thematic analyses of audio transcripts to explore issues associated with barriers and facilitators to correct use of the pack. RESULTS: All participants found at least one element of the pack challenging or impossible, but welcomed the opportunity to undertake sexual health screening without attending a clinic and welcomed the inclusion of condoms. Reported barriers to correct use included perceived overly complex STI/BBV information and instructions, feeling overwhelmed and the manual dexterity required for blood sampling. Many women struggled interpreting anatomical diagrams depicting vulvovaginal self-swabbing. Facilitators included pre-existing STI/BBV knowledge, familiarity with self-management, good social support and knowing that the service afforded privacy. CONCLUSION: In the first study to explore the usability of self-sampling packs for STI/BBV in people with learning disabilities, participants found it challenging to use the pack. Limiting information to the minimum required to inform decision-making, 'easy read' formats, simple language, large font sizes and simpler diagrams could improve acceptability. However, some people will remain unable to engage with self-sampling at all. To avoid widening health inequalities, face-to-face options should continue to be provided for those unable or unwilling to engage with self-managed care.","Middleton, Alan; Pothoulaki, Maria; Woode Owusu, Melvina; Flowers, Paul; Mapp, Fiona; Vojt, Gabriele; Laidlaw, Rebecca; Estcourt, Claudia S",Sex Transm Infect,,383

433807,Integration of Comprehensive Metrics into the PsT1 Neuroendoscopic Training System,2021,"A comprehensive description of the spin dynamics underlying the formation of Ortho-Deuterium Induced Polarization (ODIP) is presented. ODIP can serve as a tool for enhancing Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) signals of 2H nuclei, being important probes of molecular structure and dynamics. To produce ODIP, in the first step, the D2 gas is brought to thermal equilibrium at low temperature, here 30 K, so that the ortho-component, corresponding to the total spin of the 2H nuclei equal to 0 and 2, is enriched, here to 92%. In the second step, the orthodeuterium molecule is attached to a substrate molecule using a suitable hydrogenation catalyst such that the symmetry of the two 2H nuclei is broken. As a result, the non-thermal spin order of orthodeuterium is converted into enhancement of observable NMR signals. In this work, we perform a theoretical study of ODIP and calculate the shape of ODIP spectra and their dependence on the magnetization flip angle. These results are compared with experiments performed for a number of substrates; good agreement between experimental and calculated ODIP spectra is found. We also discuss the performance of NMR techniques for converting anti-phase ODIP spectral patterns into in-phase patterns, which are more suitable for signal detection and for transferring ODIP to heteronuclei, here to 13C spins.

This situation is especially critical with the increase of the number of patients because of the pandemic of COVID-19. In the present work, a web-based medical records management system was developed with an easy-to-use interface for digital immigrant users. For the management and development of the project, the XP (eXtreme Programming) methodology of the software life cycle was successfully applied. The system was developed using open source technologies: PHP as programming language and the Bootstrap framework for the design of user interfaces. The result was an elegant and modern user interface that provides ease of use to digital immigrant users. The system was validated through an experimental evaluation carried out at the medical center of “La Concordia”, in Ecuador. This evaluation was based on Jakob Nielsen usability principles and the software product quality norms of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard. The heuristic validation of the proposal resulted in a 93% of acceptance whilst function tests where successful in 96% of times. Besides, the result of a SUS test with the participation of five digital immigrants turn out in a 91.5% of system usability. Finally, it is worth mentioning that this software is now in exploitation in a local medical center with successful results. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Celi-Párraga, R.; Fernández-Peña, F.; Coello-Fiallos, D.","2nd International Conference on Applied Technologies, ICAT 2020",,383

The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of risk factors for poor outcomes due to COVID-19 infection in an older population. METHOD: The proportion of the population with one or more risk factors and the prevalence of individual risk factors and multiple risk factors were calculated among Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) clients aged &#8805;70 years. RESULTS: There were 103,422 DVA clients included. Of these, 79% in the community and 82% in residential aged care had at least one risk factor for poor outcomes from COVID-19. Hypertension was most prevalent, followed by chronic heart and airways disease. Over half had &#8805;2 risk factors, and one in five had &#8805;3 risk factors across multiple body systems. DISCUSSION: A substantial proportion of older Australians are at risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19 because of their multimorbid risk profile. These patients should be prioritised for proactive monitoring to avoid unintentional harm due to potential omission of care during the pandemic.","Pratt, N L; Kalisch Ellett, L M; Andrade, A Q; Le Blanc, V T; Barratt, J; Roughead, E E",Aust J Gen Pract,,383

Scale-up of evidence-based psychosocial interventions is a key challenge. We developed the Thinking Healthy Programme (THP), a psychosocial intervention that can be delivered by non-specialist providers such as community health workers in primary and secondary care settings. Our research showed that three out of 4 women with perinatal depression who received the programme recovered, and there were beneficial effects on infant outcomes. In over a decade since the original research, policy and practice uptake of the programme globally has been promising. We describe factors contributing to this: the programme is relatively inexpensive and culturally transferable; the intervention can be integrated with existing maternal and child health programmes; the programme is amenable to 'task-sharing' via peers, nurses, community health-workers and other frontline workers; cascaded models of training and supervision, and the use of technology for training and delivery provide exciting future avenues for scaled-up implementation. These innovations are relevant to the neglected field of public mental health, especially in the post COVID19 era when rates of anxiety and depression are likely to rise globally.","Rahman, Atif; Waqas, Ahmed; Nisar, Anum; Nazir, Huma; Sikander, Siham; Atif, Najia",Int Rev Psychiatry,,383

Methods: In this single-center retrospective cohort study, we collected and analyzed data form 133 severe COVID-19 patients admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Eastern District) from January 30 to February 18, 2020. Patients were divided into myocardial injury group (n=29) and non-myocardial injury group (n=104) according the presence or absence of myocardial injury. The general information of patients was collected by electronic medical record database system. All patients were followed up for 30 days, the organ injury and/or dysfunction were monitored, the in-hospital death was compared between the two groups, and the disease progression was reevaluated and classified at 14 days after initial hospitalization. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors of myocardial injury in severe COVID-19 patients. The ROC of NLR was calculated, and the AUC was determined to estimate the optimal cut-off value of NLR for predicting myocardial injury in severe cases of COVID-19. Results: There was statistical significance in age, respiratory frequency, systolic blood pressure, symptoms of dyspnea, previous chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease history, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, C-reactive protein, platelet counting, aspartate transaminase, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, urea, estimated glomerular filtration rate, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, D-dimer, CD3+, CD4+, partial pressure of oxygen, partial pressure of CO2, blood oxygen saturation, other organ injury, clinical outcome and prognosis between patients with myocardial injury and without myocardial injury (all P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NLR was a risk factor for myocardial injury (OR=1.066ï¼95%CI 1.021-1.111ï¼P=0.033). ROC curve showed that NLR predicting AUC of myocardial injury in severe COVID-19 patients was 0.774 (95%CI 0.694-0.842), the optimal cut-off value of NLR was 5.768, with a sensitivity of 82.8%, and specificity of 69.5%. Conclusion: NLR may be used to predict myocardial injury in severe COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Y; Wang, K J; Luo, Y C; Wang, B Z; Zhang, M M; Xu, Y Q; Yang, Y N; Ma, Y T",Zhonghua Xin Xue Guan Bing Za Zhi,,383

443101,Encountering COVID-19 as Endocrinologists,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is one of the greatest threats to human beings in terms of health care, economy, and society in recent history. Up to this moment, there have been no signs of remission, and there is no proven effective cure. Vaccination is the primary biomedical preventive measure against the novel coronavirus. However, public bias or sentiments, as reflected on social media, may have a significant impact on the progression toward achieving herd immunity. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use machine learning methods to extract topics and sentiments relating to COVID-19 vaccination on Twitter. METHODS: We collected 31,100 English tweets containing COVID-19 vaccine-related keywords between January and October 2020 from Australian Twitter users. Specifically, we analyzed tweets by visualizing high-frequency word clouds and correlations between word tokens. We built a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model to identify commonly discussed topics in a large sample of tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis to understand the overall sentiments and emotions related to COVID-19 vaccination in Australia. RESULTS: Our analysis identified 3 LDA topics: (1) attitudes toward COVID-19 and its vaccination, (2) advocating infection control measures against COVID-19, and (3) misconceptions and complaints about COVID-19 control. Nearly two-thirds of the sentiments of all tweets expressed a positive public opinion about the COVID-19 vaccine; around one-third were negative. Among the 8 basic emotions, trust and anticipation were the two prominent positive emotions observed in the tweets, while fear was the top negative emotion. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that some Twitter users in Australia supported infection control measures against COVID-19 and refuted misinformation. However, those who underestimated the risks and severity of COVID-19 may have rationalized their position on COVID-19 vaccination with conspiracy theories. We also noticed that the level of positive sentiment among the public may not be sufficient to increase vaccination coverage to a level high enough to achieve vaccination-induced herd immunity. Governments should explore public opinion and sentiments toward COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination, and implement an effective vaccination promotion scheme in addition to supporting the development and clinical administration of COVID-19 vaccines.","Kwok, Stephen Wai Hang; Vadde, Sai Kumar; Wang, Guanjin",J Med Internet Res,,383

The results show that the best pool size is three to five, under reasonable assumptions.

METHODS: A purposive sample of 100 survivors discharged from a large University hospital were assessed 4 to 8 weeks after discharge by a multidisciplinary team of rehabilitation professionals using a specialist telephone screening tool designed to capture symptoms and impact on daily life. EQ-5D-5L telephone version was also completed. RESULTS: Participants were between 29 and 71 days (mean 48 days) postdischarge from hospital. Thirty-two participants required treatment in intensive care unit (ICU group) and 68 were managed in hospital wards without needing ICU care (ward group). New illness-related fatigue was the most common reported symptom by 72% participants in ICU group and 60.3% in ward group. The next most common symptoms were breathlessness (65.6% in ICU group and 42.6% in ward group) and psychological distress (46.9% in ICU group and 23.5% in ward group). There was a clinically significant drop in EQ5D in 68.8% in ICU group and in 45.6% in ward group. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study from the United Kingdom reporting on postdischarge symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess whether the use of social networks is associated with increased anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic among members of critical care teams. METHODS: We distributed a web-based survey to physicians, residents, registered and auxiliary nurses, and nurse anesthetists providing critical care (anesthesiology, intensive care, or emergency medicine) in several French hospitals. The survey evaluated the respondents' use of social networks, their sources of information on COVID-19, and their levels of anxiety and information regarding COVID-19 on analog scales from 0 to 10. RESULTS: We included 641 respondents in the final analysis; 553 (86.3%) used social networks, spending a median time of 60 minutes (IQR 30-90) per day on these networks. COVID-19-related anxiety was higher in social network users than in health care workers who did not use these networks (median 6, IQR 5-8 vs median 5, IQR 3-7) in univariate (P=.02) and multivariate (P<.001) analyses, with an average anxiety increase of 10% in social network users. Anxiety was higher among health care workers using social networks to obtain information on COVID-19 than among those using other sources (median 6, IQR 5-8 vs median 6, IQR 4-7; P=.04). Social network users considered that they were less informed about COVID-19 than those who did not use social networks (median 8, IQR 7-9 vs median 7, IQR 6-8; P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that social networks contribute to increased anxiety in critical care teams. To protect their mental health, critical care professionals should consider limiting their use of these networks during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Clavier, Thomas; Popoff, Benjamin; Selim, Jean; Beuzelin, Marion; Roussel, Melanie; Compere, Vincent; Veber, Benoit; Besnier, Emmanuel",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,383

The combination of numerical encoding techniques and digital signal processing methods are becoming increasingly important in handling large genomic data. In this paper, we propose to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 genomic signature using the combination of different nucleotide representations and signal processing tools in the aim to identify its genetic origin. The sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was compared with 21 relevant sequences including bat, yak and pangolin coronavirus sequences. In addition, we developed a new algorithm to locate the nucleotide modifications. The results show that the Bat and Pangolin coronaviruses were the most related to SARS-CoV-2 with 96% and 86% of identity all along the genome. Within the S gene sequence, the Pangolin sequence presents local highest nucleotide identity. Those findings suggest genesis of SARS-Cov-2 through evolution from bat and pangolin strains. This study offers new ways to automatically characterize viruses.","Touati, Rabeb; Haddad-Boubaker, Sondes; Ferchichi, Imen; Messaoudi, Imen; Ouesleti, Afef Elloumi; Triki, Henda; Lachiri, Zied; Kharrat, Maher",Genomics,,383

It may also play an important role in the fear of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, the present study tested the mediating role of mindful awareness and humor (both identified as coping strategies for dealing with stressful situations) in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and hopelessness. Participants comprised 786 Turkish individuals (562 females and 224 males; aged between 18 and 67 years) from 71 of 81 cities in Turkey. An online convenience sampling method was used to recruit participants. Participants completed surveys including the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, and Coping Humor Scale. The model was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM) and utilizing bootstrapping. The results of SEM showed that the effect of fear of COVID-19 on hopelessness was partly mediated by mindfulness and humor, and which was supported by bootstrapping. Therefore, higher fear of COVID-19 was associated with lower mindfulness and humor. In turn, lower mindfulness and humor were related with higher hopelessness. Findings are discussed in the context of COVID-19 and the hopelessness literature, and practical implications for counselors are also provided.","Saricali, Mehmet; Satici, Seydi Ahmet; Satici, Begum; Gocet-Tekin, Emine; Griffiths, Mark D",Int J Ment Health Addict,,383

Current guidelines recommend suboccipital decompressive craniectomy (SDC) with dural expansion when medical therapy is not sufficient. However, there is no good-quality evidence to support this surgical practice, and both surgical timing and technique remain controverted. In this study, we describe an alternative to SDC, namely surgical evacuation of infarcted tissue (necrosectomy) and its clinical outcomes. METHODS: - In this retrospective, single-center study, 34 consecutive patients with SOCS undergoing necrosectomy via osteoplastic craniotomy were included. Patient characteristics and radiological findings were evaluated. In order to differentiate the effects of age on the functional outcome, patients were divided into two groups (group I: age &#8804;60; group II: age >60). Functional outcome was assessed using the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), modified Rankin scale (mRS) and Barthel index (BI) at the time of discharge and 30 days postoperatively. RESULTS: - In our cohort, we observed a 21% overall mortality, while 76% of patients reached good functional outcome (GOS&#8805;4). No statistically significant differences in mortality or functional outcome were observed between both patient groups. Comparing our data to a recent meta-analysis on SDC, the number of adverse events and unfavorable outcome showed equipoise between both treatment modalities. CONCLUSIONS: - Necrosectomy appears to be a suitable alternative to SDC in SOCS, achieving comparable mortality and functional outcomes. Further trials are necessary to evaluate which surgical technique is more beneficial in the setting of SOCS.","Hernández-Durán, Silvia; Wolfert, Christina; Rohde, Veit; Mielke, Dorothee",World neurosurgery (Online),,383

DESIGN: Prospective cohort survey study, 30 April - 18 May 2020. SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Staff (scientists and non-scientists) and students at five medical research institutes in Sydney, New South Wales. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-assessed overall and task-specific productivity, and mental health. RESULTS: The proportions of non-scientists and scientists who wore pyjamas during the day were similar (3% v 11%; P = 0.31). Wearing pyjamas was not associated with differences in self-evaluated productivity, but was significantly associated with more frequent reporting of poorer mental health than non-pyjama wearers while working from home (59% v 26%; P < 0.001). Having children in the home were significantly associated with changes in productivity. Larger proportions of people with toddlers reported reduced overall productivity (63% v 32%; P = 0.008), and reduced productivity in writing manuscripts (50% v 17%; P = 0.023) and data analysis (63% v 23%; P = 0.002). People with primary school children more frequently reported reduced productivity in writing manuscripts (42% v 16%; P = 0.026) and generating new ideas (43% v 19%; P = 0.030). On a positive note, the presence of children in the home was not associated with changes in mental health during the pandemic. In contrast to established researchers, early career researchers frequently reported reduced productivity while working at home. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are probably applicable to scientists in other countries. They may help improve work-from-home policies by removing the stigma associated with pyjama wearing during work and by providing support for working parents and early career researchers.","Chapman, David G; Thamrin, Cindy",Med J Aust,,383
449037,Covid-19: Impact on Human Rights from the Healthcare Perspective in the Case of Patients Triage,2021,"Infection by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes different presentations of COVID-19 and some patients may progress to a critical, fatal form of the disease that requires their admission to ICU and invasive mechanical ventilation. In order to predict in advance which patients could be more susceptible to develop a critical form of COVID-19, it is essential to define the most adequate biomarkers. In this study, we analyzed several parameters related to the cellular immune response in blood samples from 109 patients with different presentations of COVID-19 who were recruited in Hospitals and Primary Healthcare Centers in Madrid, Spain, during the first pandemic peak between April and June 2020. Hospitalized patients with the most severe forms of COVID-19 showed a potent inflammatory response that was not translated into an efficient immune response. Despite the high levels of effector cytotoxic cell populations such as NK, NKT and CD8+ T cells, they displayed immune exhaustion markers and poor cytotoxic functionality against target cells infected with pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 or cells lacking MHC class I molecules. Moreover, patients with critical COVID-19 showed low levels of the highly cytotoxic TCRÎ³Î´+ CD8+ T cell subpopulation. Conversely, CD4 count was greatly reduced in association to high levels of Tregs, low plasma IL-2 and impaired Th1 differentiation. The relative importance of these immunological parameters to predict COVID-19 severity was analyzed by Random Forest algorithm and we concluded that the most important features were related to an efficient cytotoxic response. Therefore, efforts to fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection should be focused not only to decrease the disproportionate inflammatory response, but also to elicit an efficient cytotoxic response against the infected cells and to reduce viral replication.","Vigón, Lorena; Fuertes, Daniel; García-Pérez, Javier; Torres, Montserrat; Rodríguez-Mora, Sara; Mateos, Elena; Corona, Magdalena; Saez-Marín, Adolfo J; Malo, Rosa; Navarro, Cristina; Murciano-Antón, María Aranzazu; Cervero, Miguel; Alcamí, José; García-Gutiérrez, Valentín; Planelles, Vicente; López-Huertas, María Rosa; Coiras, Mayte",Front Immunol,,383

Here, we develop a modular method for high-yield extraction of viral single-stranded nucleic acids by using ""capture"" ssDNA sequences attached to carbon nanotubes. Target SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA can be captured by ssDNA-nanotube constructs via hybridization and separated from the liquid phase in a single-tube system with minimal chemical reagents, for downstream quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detection. This nanotube-based extraction method enables 100% extraction yield of target SARS-CoV-2 RNA from phosphate-buffered saline in comparison to â¼20% extraction yield when using a commercial silica-column kit. Notably, carbon nanotubes enable extraction of nucleic acids directly from 50% human saliva with a similar efficiency as achieved with commercial DNA/RNA extraction kits, thereby bypassing the need for further biofluid purification and avoiding the use of commercial extraction kits. Carbon nanotube-based extraction of viral nucleic acids facilitates high-yield and high-sensitivity identification of viral nucleic acids such as the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome with a reduced reliance on reagents affected by supply chain obstacles.","Jeong, Sanghwa; González-Grandío, Eduardo; Navarro, Nicole; Pinals, Rebecca L; Ledesma, Francis; Yang, Darwin; Landry, Markita P",ACS Nano,,383

452765,Development of a Murine Model of Pyogenic Flexor Tenosynovitis,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, it is known that a substantial percentage of the adult population does not become infected when exposed to this novel coronavirus. Several studies provide an initial indication of the possible role of pre-existing immunity, whether cross-immunity or not. The possible role of latent tuberculosis (TB) and malaria has been suggested to create innate cross heterogeneous immunity. In this study, we looked for the influence of these factors on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality in malaria-endemic countries. STUDY DESIGN: Eighty malaria-endemic countries were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Data subjected to testing included TB prevalence, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine coverage, malaria incidence, and COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: Hierarchical multiple regression type of analysis was used for data analyses. TB prevalence per 100,000 population standardized to BCG coverage rates was taken as a direct factor in the test. Malaria incidence per 1000 population was considered an intermediate factor. The outcome was COVID-19 mortality per million population. RESULTS: The results showed with robust statistical support that standardized TB prevalence was significantly associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality. Malaria had an additional effect in reducing COVID-19 mortality, with a highly significant association. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria and standardized TB prevalence are statistically significant factors associated negatively with COVID-19 mortality.","Raham, T F",Public Health,,383
452773,The Role of Repeat Chest CT Scan in the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Dietary studies showed that dietary-related problem such as obesity is associated with other chronic diseases like hypertension, irregular blood sugar levels, and increased risk of heart attacks. The primary cause of these problems is poor lifestyle choices and unhealthy dietary habits, which are manageable using interactive mHealth apps. However, traditional dietary monitoring systems using manual food logging suffer from imprecision, underreporting, time consumption, and low adherence. Recent dietary monitoring systems tackle these challenges by automatic assessment of dietary intake through machine learning methods. This survey discusses the most performing methodologies that have been developed so far for automatic food recognition and volume estimation. First, we will present the rationale of visual-based methods for food recognition. The core of the paper is the presentation, discussion and evaluation of these methods on popular food image databases. Following that, we discussed the mobile applications that are implementing these methods. The survey ends with a discussion of research gaps and open issues in this area.","Tahir, Ghalib; Loo, Chu Kiong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11776v3.pdf,383
453713,Variation in COVID-19 Mortality Across 117 US Hospitals in High- and Low-Burden Settings,2021,"The emergence of the COVID-19 outbreak at the end of 2019, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has, to date, led to over 13.6 million infections and nearly 600,000 deaths. Consequently, there is an urgent need to better understand the molecular factors triggering immune defense against the virus and to develop countermeasures to hinder its spread. Using in silico analyses, we showed that human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I cell-surface molecules vary in their capacity for binding different SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes, i.e., short sequences of 8-11 amino acids, and pinpointed five specific SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that are likely to be presented to cytotoxic T-cells and hence activate immune responses. The identified epitopes, each one of nine amino acids, have high sequence similarity to the equivalent epitopes of SARS-CoV virus, which are known to elicit an effective T cell response in vitro. Moreover, we give a structural explanation for the binding of SARS-CoV-2-epitopes to MHC molecules. Our data can help us to better understand the differences in outcomes of COVID-19 patients and may aid the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and possible future outbreaks of novel coronaviruses.","Ranga, Vipin; Niemelä, Erik; Tamirat, Mahlet Z.; Eriksson, John E.; Airenne, Tomi T.; Johnson, Mark S.",Vaccines,,383
453714,Variation in COVID-19 Mortality Across 117 US Hospitals in High- and Low-Burden Settings,2021,"BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty about the associations of angiotensive enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs with COVID-19 disease. We studied whether patients prescribed these drugs had altered risks of contracting severe COVID-19 disease and receiving associated intensive care unit (ICU) admission. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study using routinely collected data from 1205 general practices in England with 8.28 million participants aged 20-99 years. We used Cox proportional hazards models to derive adjusted HRs for exposure to ACE inhibitor and ARB drugs adjusted for sociodemographic factors, concurrent medications and geographical region. The primary outcomes were: (a) COVID-19 RT-PCR diagnosed disease and (b) COVID-19 disease resulting in ICU care. FINDINGS: Of 19 486 patients who had COVID-19 disease, 1286 received ICU care. ACE inhibitors were associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 disease (adjusted HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.74) but no increased risk of ICU care (adjusted HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.06) after adjusting for a wide range of confounders. Adjusted HRs for ARBs were 0.63 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.67) for COVID-19 disease and 1.02 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.25) for ICU care.There were significant interactions between ethnicity and ACE inhibitors and ARBs for COVID-19 disease. The risk of COVID-19 disease associated with ACE inhibitors was higher in Caribbean (adjusted HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.28) and Black African (adjusted HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.59) groups than the white group (adjusted HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.70). A higher risk of COVID-19 with ARBs was seen for Black African (adjusted HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.58) than the white (adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.62) group. INTERPRETATION: ACE inhibitors and ARBs are associated with reduced risks of COVID-19 disease after adjusting for a wide range of variables. Neither ACE inhibitors nor ARBs are associated with significantly increased risks of receiving ICU care. Variations between different ethnic groups raise the possibility of ethnic-specific effects of ACE inhibitors/ARBs on COVID-19 disease susceptibility and severity which deserves further study.","Hippisley-Cox, Julia; Young, Duncan; Coupland, Carol; Channon, Keith M; Tan, Pui San; Harrison, David A; Rowan, Kathryn; Aveyard, Paul; Pavord, Ian D; Watkinson, Peter J",Heart,,383

The doctors were selected using disproportionate stratified sampling and medical undergraduates using stratified cluster sampling. Data were gathered using a Google form containing socio-demographic details, perception on the pandemic and the General Health Questionnaire-12(GHQ-12).ResultThere were 468 participants in the study and among them 243(51.9%) were doctors. Mean age of the doctors’ is 34.54(SD = 7.43) years and more than half (50.06%) were in post graduate training. Majority were worried about their health (65%) and their loved one's health (90.1%). Among doctors 220(90.5%) felt that they have moderate or higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 and 15.6% would not have worked due to the risk. According to GHQ-12, 182(74%) doctors were psychologically distressed (mean GHQ = 12.64, SD = 4.54) and it was significantly associated with age less than 35 years (p = 0.039) and worry about interruption of their daily routines(p = 0.010).The mean age of 225 medical undergraduates was 25.20 (SD = 1.34) years and 176(78.2%) of the participants were psychologically distressed (mean GHQ = 14.32, SD = 6.67). Majority (59.11%) believed that they are at high risk of getting COVID-19. Their distress was significantly associated with the worry about the impact of COVID-19 related restrictions on their daily routines (p = 0.000).Binomial logistic regression confirmed that doctors were distressed due to impact on their income whereas both doctors and medical undergraduates were distressed due to impact on daily routines.ConclusionNearly three quarter of both doctors and medical undergraduates were psychologically distressed during COVID-19 pandemic. The worry was due to contracting illness, financial issues and the COVID-19 regulations.","Suraweera, Chathurie Perera Iresha Rupasinghe Priyanka Galhenage Janith",BJPsych Open,,383

Similar to other high-income countries, Australia has extensively used telehealth services. Virtual health care, including telemedicine in combination with remote patient monitoring, has been implemented in certain settings as part of new models of care that are aimed at managing patients with COVID-19 outside the hospital setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the implementation of and early experience with virtual health care for community management of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This observational cohort study was conducted with patients with COVID-19 who availed of a large Australian metropolitan health service with an established virtual health care program capable of monitoring patients remotely. We included patients with COVID-19 who received the health service, could self-isolate safely, did not require immediate admission to an in-patient setting, had no major active comorbid illness, and could be managed at home or at other suitable sites. Skin temperature, pulse rate, and blood oxygen saturation were remotely monitored. The primary outcome measures were care escalation rates, including emergency department presentation, and hospital admission. RESULTS: During March 11-29, 2020, a total of 162 of 173 (93.6%) patients with COVID-19 (median age 38 years, range 11-79 years), who were diagnosed locally, were enrolled in the virtual health care program. For 62 of 162 (38.3%) patients discharged during this period, the median length of stay was 8 (range 1-17) days. The peak of 100 prevalent patients equated to approximately 25 patients per registered nurse per shift. Patients were contacted a median of 16 (range 1-30) times during this period. Video consultations (n=1902, 66.3%) comprised most of the patient contacts, and 132 (81.5%) patients were monitored remotely. Care escalation rates were low, with an ambulance attendance rate of 3% (n=5), emergency department attendance rate of 2.5% (n=4), and hospital admission rate of 1.9% (n=3). No deaths were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based virtual health care is safe for managing most patients with COVID-19 and can be rapidly implemented in an urban Australian setting for pandemic management. Health services implementing virtual health care should anticipate challenges associated with rapid technology deployments and provide adequate support to resolve them, including strategies to support the use of health information technologies among consumers.","Hutchings, Owen Rhys; Dearing, Cassandra; Jagers, Dianna; Shaw, Miranda Jane; Raffan, Freya; Jones, Aaron; Taggart, Richard; Sinclair, Tim; Anderson, Teresa; Ritchie, Angus Graham",J Med Internet Res,,383

458770,The potential impact of enhanced hygienic measures during the COVID-19 outbreak on hospital-acquired infections: A pragmatic study in neurological units,2020,"The humoral immune response plays a key role in suppressing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular determinants underlying the neutralization of the virus remain, however, incompletely understood. Here, we show that the ability of antibodies to disrupt the binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the cell, the key molecular event initiating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, is controlled by the affinity of these antibodies to the viral antigen. By using microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling, we were able to quantify the serum-antibody mediated inhibition of ACE2-spike binding in two SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals. Measurements to determine the affinity, concentration, and neutralization potential of antibodies were performed directly in human serum. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the level of inhibition in both samples can be quantitatively described using the dissociation constants (KD) of the binary interactions between the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein as well as the spike protein and the neutralizing antibody. These experiments represent a new type of in-solution receptor binding competition assay, which has further potential applications, ranging from decisions on donor selection for convalescent plasma therapy, to identification of lead candidates in therapeutic antibody development, and vaccine development.","Fiedler, Sebastian; Piziorska, Monika A; Denninger, Viola; Morgunov, Alexey S; Ilsley, Alison; Malik, Anisa Y; Schneider, Matthias M; Devenish, Sean R A; Meisl, Georg; Kosmoliaptsis, Vasilis; Aguzzi, Adriano; Fiegler, Heike; Knowles, Tuomas P J",ACS infect. dis,,383

459451,Intracranial hemorrhage in a young COVID-19 patient,2020,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is responsible for the ongoing 2019-2020 pandemic. Venous thromboembolism (VTE), a frequent cardiovascular and/or respiratory complication among hospitalized patients, is one of the known sequelae of the illness. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients are often elderly, immobile, and show signs of coagulopathy. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume a high incidence of VTE among these patients. Presently, the incidence of VTE is estimated at around 25% of patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit for COVID-19 even under anticoagulant treatment at prophylactic doses. In this review, we discuss present knowledge of the topic, the unique challenges of diagnosis and treatment of VTE, as well as some of the potential mechanisms of increased risk for VTE during the illness. Understanding the true impact of VTE on patients with COVID-19 will potentially improve our ability to reach a timely diagnosis and initiate proper treatment, mitigating the risk for this susceptible population during a complicated disease.","Tal, Shir; Spectre, Galia; Kornowski, Ran; Perl, Leor",Acta Haematol,,383

In countries like Brazil with colonial histories and traditions, the social markers of differences are heavily anchored in social and racial demarcation, and the political and social dynamics and processes based on structural racism act on this demarcation. The pandemic's actual profile in Brazil clashes with narratives according to which COVID-19 is a democratic pandemic, an argument aligned with the rhetoric of racial democracy that represents a powerful strategy aimed at maintaining the subaltern place of racialized populations such as indigenous peoples and blacks, as a product of modern coloniality. This essay focuses on the pandemic's profile in the Brazilian black population, in dialogue with decolonial contributions and critical readings of racism. The authors discuss government responses and COVID-19 indicators according to race/color, demonstrating the maintenance of historical storylines that continue to threaten black lives.

459574,L-arginine as a potential GLP-1-mediated immunomodulator of Th17-related cytokines in people with obesity and asthma,2021,"BACKGROUND: Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have excellent properties as gene transfer vehicles. The recent development of AAV-PHP.eB, highly BBB-permeable capsid variant of AAV serotype 9, has opened up systemic application for whole brain transduction. To attain high transduction efficacy, much efforts have been paid to purify AAV vectors using gradient centrifugation or column chromatography. These methods are time-consuming, cost substantially and require expensive equipment. NEW METHOD: We propose a simple purification method for the production of systemically applicable AAV-PHP.eB targeting the brain. The new method, which we named minimal purification (MP) method, requires only 2 steps: removal of cell debris using a syringe filter and concentration using a disposable ultrafiltration device. RESULTS: The MP method yielded 2 times more AAV-PHP.eB than the standard ultracentrifuge purification (UCP) method. Intravenous injection of AAV-PHP.eB prepared using the MP method caused robust whole brain transduction without overt toxicity on the liver and kidney. Moreover, we found almost no difference in cellular density and morphology of brain microglia between control mice and mice treated systemically with the MP viral solution, suggesting no influence of the viral injection on brain immunity. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The new method, which requires only a benchtop centrifuge and takes only 2-4â¯h to obtain a ready-to-use viral solution, is much less expensive than the existing UCP method, and can avoid cumbersome and time-consuming purification processes. CONCLUSIONS: This simplified method further expands the use of AAV vectors in the neuroscience community.","Konno, Ayumu; Hirai, Hirokazu",J Neurosci Methods,,383

For example, the predictive coding framework assumes that people take contextual information into account when anticipating other's actions. Likewise, the teleological stance theory assumes an early developing ability to consider situational constraints in action prediction. The current study investigates, over a wide age range, whether humans flexibly integrate situational constraints in their action anticipations. By means of an eye-tracking experiment, 2-year-olds, 5-year-olds, younger and older adults (together N = 181) observed an agent repeatedly taking one of two paths to reach a goal. Then, this path became blocked, and for test trials only the other path was passable. Results demonstrated that in test trials younger and older adults anticipated that the agent would take the continuous path, indicating that they took the situational constraints into account. In contrast, 2- and 5-year-olds anticipated that the agent would take the blocked path, indicating that they still relied on the agent's previous observed behaviour and-contrary to claims by the teleological stance theory-did not take the situational constraints into account. The results highlight developmental changes in human's ability to include situational constraints in their visual anticipations. Overall, the study contributes to theories on predictive coding and the development of action understanding.","Ganglmayer, Kerstin; Haupt, Marleen; Finke, Kathrin; Paulus, Markus",Cogn. process.

Many patients at Fangcang Hospitals had complications or mental stress. As the doctors, nurses and paramedics presented in the emergency, there was a growing demand for clinical pharmacists to provide pharmaceutical care for the affected patients with chronic diseases via telemedicine. OBJECTIVE: This study was a retrospective study to evaluate the usefulness of clinical prevention and control measures of clinical pharmacists at Jianghan Fangcang Hospital. Besides, this study proposed innovative strategies for developing pharmacy services to ensure the medication compliance, accuracy and cure rates under the epidemic. METHODS: A total of 374 patients filled in the questionnaires and 349 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients who refused to receive pharmaceutical care were not included in this study. The pharmaceutical care included medication education via broadcast station, medication reconciliation, optimisation of drug use, monitor of adverse drug events and psychological comfort via WeChat one-to-one service. The data were collected from patients' interviews and the questionnaires of inpatients and discharged patients. RESULTS: In Jianghan Fangcang Hospital, many patients had complications with hypertension (12.9%), hyperlipidaemia (9.2%), thyroid disease (8.9%), diabetes (7.2%), heart disease (3.4%), nephropathy (1.7%), cancer (1.1%) and other diseases (12.6%). After 35 days' pharmacy service, about 200 different questions had been solved by our clinical pharmacists, including drug usage (65.38%), medication reconciliation (55.13%), drug precautions (23.1%), adverse drug reactions (35.9%) and psychological counselling (32.05%). Most patients were satisfied with clinical pharmacist service (66.7% great, 18.0% good). CONCLUSION: The results of the retrospective study indicated that clinical pharmacist can effectively reduce and prevent drug-related, life-related and COVID-19-related problems for COVID-19 patients, which is important for the disease recovery.

Objectives This paper assesses the initial responses of major farming and food systems to COVID-19 in 25 Asian countries, and considers the implications for resilience, food and nutrition security and recovery policies by the governments. Methods A conceptual systems model was specified including key pathways linking the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 to the resilience and performance of the four principal Asian farming and food systems, viz, lowland rice based;irrigated wheat based;hill mixed;and dryland mixed systems. Based on this framework, a systematic survey of 2504 key informants (4% policy makers, 6% researchers or University staff, 6% extension workers, 65% farmers, and 19% others) in 20 Asian countries was conducted and the results assessed and analysed. Results and conclusion The principal Asian farming and food systems were moderately resilient to COVID-19, reinforced by government policies in many countries that prioritized food availability and affordability. Rural livelihoods and food security were affected primarily because of disruptions to local labour markets (especially for off-farm work), farm produce markets (notably for perishable foods) and input supply chains (i.e., seeds and fertilisers). The overall effects on system performance were most severe in the irrigated wheat based system and least severe in the hill mixed system, associated in the latter case with greater resilience and diversification and less dependence on external inputs and long market chains. Farming and food systems' resilience and sustainability are critical considerations for recovery policies and programmes, especially in relation to economic performance that initially recovered more slowly than productivity, natural resources status and social capital. Overall, the resilience of Asian farming and food systems was strong because of inherent systems characteristics reinforced by public policies that prioritized staple food production and distribution as well as complementary welfare programmes. With the substantial risks to plant- and animal-sourced food supplies from future zoonoses and the institutional vulnerabilities revealed by COVID-19, efforts to improve resilience should be central to recovery programmes. Significance This study was the first Asia-wide systems assessment of the effects of COVID-19 on agriculture and food systems, differentiating the effects of the pandemic across the four principal regional farming and food systems in the region.","Dixon, John M.; Weerahewa, Jeevika Hellin Jon Rola-Rubzen Maria Fay Huang Jikun Kumar Shalander Das Anup Qureshi Muhammad Ejaz Krupnik Timothy J.; Shideed, Kamil Jat Mangi L.; Prasad, P.

Genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed its close resemblance to the earlier reported SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, initial testing of the drugs used against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has been ineffective in controlling SARS-CoV-2. The present study highlights the genomic, proteomic, pathogenesis, and therapeutic strategies in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have carried out sequence analysis of potential drug target proteins in SARS-CoV-2 and, compared them with SARS-CoV and MERS viruses. Analysis of mutations in the coding and non-coding regions, genetic diversity, and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 has also been done. A detailed structural analysis of drug target proteins has been performed to gain insights into the mechanism of pathogenesis, structure-function relationships, and the development of structure-guided therapeutic approaches. The cytokine profiling and inflammatory signalling are different in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Various techniques are used for the diagnosis of pneumonia including chest X-ray, CT scan, blood culture, sputum culture, fluid sample, bronchoscopy, and pulse oximetry. Medical image analysis plays a vital role in the diagnosis of various diseases like MERS, COVID-19, pneumonia, etc. and is considered to be one of the auspicious research areas. To analyze chest X-ray images accurately, there is a need for an expert radiologist who possesses expertise and experience in the desired domain. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, about 2/3 people in the world still do not have access to the radiologist, in order to diagnose their disease. This study proposes a DL framework to diagnose pneumonia disease in an efficient and effective manner. Various Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) transfer learning techniques such as AlexNet, SqueezeNet, VGG16, VGG19, and Inception-V3 are utilized for extracting useful features from the chest X-ray images. In this study, several machine learning (ML) classifiers are utilized. The proposed system has been trained and tested on chest X-ray and CT images dataset. In order to examine the stability and effectiveness of the proposed system, different performance measures have been utilized. The proposed system is intended to be beneficial and supportive for medical doctors to accurately and efficiently diagnose pneumonia disease. © 2021 Yar Muhammad et al.","Muhammad, Y.; Alshehri, M.

468658,The Impact of the Acute Phase of COVID-19 on Radiotherapy Demand in South East Wales,2020,"Since December 2019, the world has been experiencing a catastrophic pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2. This virus primarily targets the human respiratory system. Available information suggests that people with epilepsy (PWE) are not at higher risk of being infected by the virus, nor of more severe COVID-19 manifestations, as a result of the epilepsy alone. However, COVID-19 is a serious disease that currently has no effective treatment or vaccine. A face mask is probably effective in preventing the spread of a respiratory pathogen, at least to some extent. So, should we recommend wearing a face mask to all during a pandemic of respiratory infectious disease (eg, COVID-19) without any precautions or exemptions? While concrete evidence is lacking, if we consider that wearing a face mask may simulate hyperventilation, at least to some extent, we would probably avoid recommending this practice indiscriminately to all PWE. On the other hand, in the absence of any proven treatment or vaccine to combat COVID-19, prevention is the best available strategy and it is probably not reasonable to suggest avoid wearing face masks in PWE under any circumstances. Logically, PWE do not need to wear a face mask most of the time, as long as there is no close contact with others, especially during intense physical activities such as exercise. To the contrary, it is probably more advantageous to wear a face mask in crowded locations, with intermittent breaks in safe locations, away from others.","Asadi-Pooya, Ali A; Cross, J Helen",Acta neurol. scand,,383
468937,Coping Strategies by University Students in Response to COVID-19: Differences between Community and Clinical Groups,2021,"Background: Grade 2 and 3 obesity, alongside with other relevant risk factors, are substantially and independently associated with adverse outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, for Switzerland, due to the lack of synthesis studies, it is currently unknown how many people are affected by obesity at all. This knowledge may help to better estimate the relevance and size of this group at elevated risk, which could be incorporated into strategies to protect risk groups during the still unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to provide a first overall estimation of how many people in Switzerland are currently affected by grade 2 or 3 obesity. Methods: Five representative national population-based studies were accessed which were conducted between 2012 and 2017 and which include data on height and weight of adult men and women in Switzerland. Results: In Switzerland in 2012-2017, among the 11.20% adults who were obese (body mass index (BMI) &gt;=30.0kg/m2), 1.76% (95% CI 1.50-2.02) suffered from grade 2 obesity (BMI 35.0-39.9 kg/m2), and 0.58% (95% CI 0.50-0.66) from grade severe 3 obesity (BMI &gt;=40.0 kg/m2). Converted into estimated absolute population numbers, this corresponds to a total of approximately n=154,515 people who suffer from grade 2 or 3 obesity (n=116,216 and n=38,298, respectively). Conclusions: This risk group includes many younger people in Switzerland. The number of people with obesity-related risk becomes 3.8 to 13.6 times higher if grade 1 obesity and overweight people are also included in this risk group, for which there are arguments arising in the latest literature. In general, this large group at risk for severe COVID-19 should be given more attention and support. If it is confirmed that obesity plays a major role in severe COVID-19 courses, then every kilo of body weight that is not gained or that is lost in lockdown counts.","Staub, K.; Matthes, K.

469413,Cancer management during covid‐19 pandemic: Is immune checkpoint inhibitors‐based immunotherapy harmful or beneficial?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Induction of labour (IOL) is one of the most commonly performed interventions in maternity care, with outpatient cervical ripening increasingly offered as an option for women undergoing IOL. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the context of practice and the option of returning home for cervical ripening may now assume greater significance. This work aimed to examine whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed practice around IOL in the UK. METHOD: We used an online questionnaire to survey senior obstetricians and midwives at all 156 UK NHS Trusts and Boards that currently offer maternity services. Responses were analysed to produce descriptive statistics, with free text responses analysed using a conventional content analysis approach. FINDINGS: Responses were received from 92 of 156 UK Trusts and Boards, a 59% response rate. Many Trusts and Boards reported no change to their IOL practice, however 23% reported change in methods used for cervical ripening; 28% a change in criteria for home cervical ripening; 28% stated that more women were returning home during cervical ripening; and 24% noted changes to women's response to recommendations for IOL. Much of the change was reported as happening in response to attempts to minimise hospital attendance and restrictions on birth partners accompanying women. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has changed practice around induction of labour, although this varied significantly between NHS Trusts and Boards. There is a lack of formal evidence to support decision-making around outpatient cervical ripening: the basis on which changes were implemented and what evidence was used to inform decisions is not clear.","Harkness, M; Yuill, C; Cheyne, H; Stock, S J; McCourt, C",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,383

CEBAF is a continuous-wave recirculating linac utilizing 418 SRF cavities to accelerate electrons up to 12 GeV through 5-passes. Of these, 96 cavities (12 cryomodules) are designed with a digital low-level RF system configured such that a cavity fault triggers waveform recordings of 17 RF signals for each of the 8 cavities in the cryomodule. Subject matter experts (SME) are able to analyze the collected time-series data and identify which of the eight cavities faulted first and classify the type of fault. This information is used to find trends and strategically deploy mitigations to problematic cryomodules. However manually labeling the data is laborious and time-consuming. By leveraging machine learning, near real-time (rather than post-mortem) identification of the offending cavity and classification of the fault type has been implemented. We discuss performance of the ML models during a recent physics run. Results show the cavity identification and fault classification models have accuracies of 84.9% and 78.2%, respectively.","Tennant, Chris; Carpenter, Adam; Powers, Tom; Solopova, Anna Shabalina; Vidyaratne, Lasitha; Iftekharuddin, Khan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06562v1.pdf,383

471396,Less disease severity of COVID-19 among smokers: An indication of investigating nicotine as preventive measure,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has caused great difficulties in providing healthcare services worldwide. Accurate and useful indicators are needed for the effective use of resources. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also produced endogenously without exogenous exposure. Studies confirm that endogenous CO increases in conditions such as pneumonia, sepsis, and trauma. This study aimed to compare patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and healthy people to reveal whether endogenous carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels differ. It was also to determine whether it could be a helpful indicator for the clinician in predicting disease severity in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study included 72 patients admitted to the hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic and diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and a control group of 75 healthy people. The research data was collected retrospectively in a tertiary emergency department. The patients' demographic data, pneumonia severity index (PSI) score, CURB-65 score, 30-day mortality, hospitalization, need for mechanical ventilation (MV), and COHb levels were recorded. RESULTS: While the COHb level was 0.9% (min-max, 0.1 - 4.0) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, it was 1% (min-max, 0.1 - 2.6) in the control group. No significant difference was found between the patients and the control group in terms of COHb levels (p = 0.341). Also, there was no correlation between COHb levels and PSI and CURB-65 scores. No significant difference was detected between COHb levels and patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia in terms of mortality, need for MV, or hospitalization (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that COHb levels alone could not be used to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia or predict disease severity. Besides, in COVID-19 pneumonia, the COHb level was not a useful indicator of mortality, need for MV, or hospitalization decision. Further studies are needed to find useful indicators to assist clinicians in their decision-making process in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic.","Demir, Mehmet C; Akpinar, Guleser; Sultanoglu, Hasan; Yildiz-Gulhan, Pinar; Caliskan, Emel; Guclu, Derya; Karakoyun, Salih; Ince, Nevin",Clin. lab,,383

METHODS: A survey of patients with ongoing IVIs for retinal diseases was carried out between April 23rd and May 12th, 2020. We designed a questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction concerning: personal protective equipment (PPE), social distancing, the perceived quality of care, and the total time spent in the department, using a Likert scale. We also collected the time spent per patients in the outpatient IVI clinic. RESULTS: A hundred and twenty-seven eyes of 108 patients were included. The mean time spent in the IVI outpatient clinic was 31.87 +/- 16.61 min. In our survey, 99.1% of the patients were satisfied (highly satisfied or satisfied) with the new type of care provided, 89.8% with the duration of care, and 93.5% with the PPE. Satisfaction was associated with total time spent in hospital (p = 0.005), with dissatisfied patients spending about 50% more time in the hospital than satisfied patients (43.91 min vs 30.50 min). CONCLUSION: Despite the crisis-related adjustment, our survey revealed high patient satisfaction with PPE, quality of care, and total time spent in outpatient IVI clinic.","Denys, Paul; Miere, Alexandra; Colantuono, Donato; Jung, Camille; Souied, Eric H",Eur J Ophthalmol,,383

We developed a set of tools to collect and integrate individual-level data. COVID-19-related symptoms are collected using a self-reporting tool initially implemented in Qualtrics survey system and consequently moved to .NET framework. Individual movement data are collected using off-the-shelf tracking apps available for iPhone and Android phones. Data integration and analysis are done in PostgreSQL, Python, and R. As of September 2020, we collected about 184,000 daily symptom responses for 20,000 individuals, as well as over 15,000 days of GPS movement data for 175 individuals. The analysis of the data indicates that headache is the most frequently reported symptom, present almost always when any other symptoms are reported as indicated by derived association rules. It is followed by cough, sore throat, and aches. The study participants traveled on average 223.61 km every week with a large standard deviation of 254.53 and visited on average 5.77 ± 4.75 locations each week for at least 10 min. However, there is no evidence that reported symptoms or prior COVID-19 contact affects movements (p > 0.3 in most models). The evidence suggests that although some individuals limit their movements during pandemics, the overall study population do not change their movements as suggested by guidelines.","Wojtusiak, Janusz; Bagchi, Pramita; Durbha, Sri Surya Krishna Rama Taraka Naren; Mobahi, Hedyeh; Mogharab Nia, Reyhaneh; Roess, Amira",J Healthc Inform Res,,383

Distance correlation analysis and Random Forest (RF) feature selection were used to determine changes in metabolic networks. We found significant concentration differences in several amino acids, acylcarnitines and polyamines linking delirium-prone patients to known factors in Alzheimer's disease such as monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) protein. Subsequent computational structural comparison between MAOB and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as well as protein-protein docking analysis showed that there potentially is strong binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to MAOB.

478644,Disproportionate impact of COVID-19 disease among racial and ethnic minorities in the US cancer population as seen in CancerLinQ Discovery data,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of 2020 the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread to nearly every country in the world. The mainly airborne pathogen has led to large numbers of deaths, principally in elderly and vulnerable segments of the population. Protective vaccines have recently become available, but it is not yet clear whether and when population-wide immunity will be achieved. The existence of evidence for the protective effect of masks covering the mouth and nose is a topic of public debate. METHODS: A selective literature search was carried out in PubMed. Data from the German Robert Koch Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were also taken into account. RESULTS: When talking, as many as 20 000 droplets ranging in size from 20 to 500 µM are released every second. According to PCR tests, the amount of virus exhaled is highest immediately before the onset of symptoms. No randomized trials have been conducted on the effect of masks covering the mouth and nose. A metaanalysis of 29 studies on infection with SARS-CoV-2, SARS, or MERS revealed that type N-95 masks (corresponding approximately to FFP-2), surgical masks, or similar multilayer cotton masks can greatly reduce the infection risk for the wearers (RR 0.34 [0.26; 0.45], with moderate heterogeneity [I2 = 48%]). Model experiments and case reports suggest that masks covering the mouth and nose afford considerable protection against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other airborne diseases by reducing release of and exposure to potentially infectious droplets; in addition, infections that do occur take a milder course. A limitation of the studies analyzed is that in most cases, this effect cannot be viewed in isolation from the protective impact of other measures (distancing, hygiene precautions). CONCLUSION: It can plausibly be assumed that consistent use of masks covering the mouth and nose can play an important role in containing the spread of SARSCoV- 2.","Hemmer, Christoph Josef; Hufert, Frank; Siewert, Stefan; Reisinger, Emil",Dtsch Arztebl Int,,383

In view of this, it is important to forecast the COVID-19 evaluation of Italy condition and the possible effects, if this lock down could continue for another 60 days. METHODS: COVID-19 infected patient data has extracted from the Italian Health Ministry website includes registered and recovered cases from mid February to end March. Adoption of seasonal ARIMA forecasting package with R statistical model was done. RESULTS: Predictions were done with 93.75% of accuracy for registered case models and 84.4% of accuracy for recovered case models. The forecasting of infected patients could be reach the value of 182,757, and recovered cases could be registered value of 81,635 at end of May. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of country lockdown and self isolation in control the disease transmissibility among Italian population through data driven model analysis. Our findings suggest that nearly 35% decrement of registered cases and 66% growth of recovered cases will be possible.","Chintalapudi, Nalini; Battineni, Gopi; Amenta, Francesco",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,,383

481774,COVID-19 pandemic impact on Brazilian patients with lysosomal diseases: A patient's perspective,2021,"Convalescent plasma (CP) recurs as a frontline treatment in epidemics because it is available as soon as there are survivors. The COVID-19 pandemic represented the first large-scale opportunity to shed light into mechanisms of action, safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma using modern evidence-based medicine approaches. Studies ranging from observational case series to randomized controlled trials (RCT) have reported highly variable efficacy results for COVID-19 CP (CCP), resulting in more doubt than certainty. Reasons for CCP success and failure may be hidden in study details, which are usually difficult to explain to physicians and the public but provide fertile ground for designing next-generation studies. In this paper we analyzed variables associated with efficacy such as clinical settings, disease severity, CCP SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and function, dose, timing of administration (variously defined as time from onset of symptoms, molecular diagnosis, diagnosis of pneumonia, or hospitalization, or by serostatus), outcomes (defined as hospitalization, requirement for ventilation, clinical improvement or mortality), CCP provenance and time for collection, and criteria for efficacy. Focusing only on the results from the 23 available RCT we noted that these were more likely to show signals of efficacy, including reductions in mortality, if the plasma neutralizing titer was [≥] 160 and the time to randomization was [≤] 9 days, consistent with passive antibody therapy efficacy requiring dosing with sufficient antibody. The fact that most studies revealed signals of efficacy despite variability in CCP and its use suggest robust therapeutic effects that become apparent despite the data noise.","Focosi, Daniele; Franchini, Massimo; Pirofski, Liise-anne; Burnouf, Thierry; Paneth, Nigel; Joyner, Michael J; Casadevall, Arturo",,,383
481787,How to Leverage the Medicare Program for a COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign,2020,"Background: Considering the importance of preventive behaviors in reducing the transmission of COVID-19, this study was conducted to determine the preventive behaviors toward the spread of COVID-19. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed 7 weeks after the confirmation of the first case of Covid-19 by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education in Iran. Data were completed online using a researcher-made questionnaire, the validity and reliability of which were confirmed, for 1,200 Iranians from 8 April 2020 to 9 May 2020. Results: The mean age of study participants was 37.77 ± 11.20 years. The mean score of preventive behaviors was 62.67 ± 8.53. The results showed that there was a significant relationship between the variables of gender, education, economic status, and preventive behaviors of COVID-19. The highest frequency is related to not using hookah and cigarettes and then avoiding losing and rubbing (78%) and the lowest percentage is related to exercising behavior (16%). Conclusion: Due to the low level of prevention behaviors during the outbreak of the disease, it is important to design educational and supportive interventions to improve and perform coronavirus prevention behaviors with more focus on men, illiterate people, and poor economic status.","Baghernezhad Hesary, Fatemeh; Salehiniya, Hamid; Miri, Mohammadreza; Moodi, Mitra",Front Public Health,,383
482167,Global Effort to Collect Data on Ventilated Patients With COVID-19,2020,"[Display omitted] • The coating was synthesized by non-toxic or low-toxic reagent. • The coating can be used in goggles. • The coating has excellent transparency under visible light. • The coating exhibited high mechanical properties, antifogging and self-cleaning. During the outbreak of COVID-19, the fogging of goggles was a fatal problem for doctors. At present, there are many ways to prevent fogging by adjusting surface wettability. However, the mechanical properties of most super-hydrophilic antifogging coatings are poor, easy to lose their antifogging properties when encountering fingers or cloth friction. To address this issue, the Konjac Glucomannan was cross-linked with water-soluble silicone fluid to form a binder, then being combined with the modified Ecokimera to prepare an eco-friendly super-hydrophilic coating that possessed excellent super-hydrophilicity, and the water contact angle (WCA) was 2.51 ± 1°. In addition, the WCA is still about 5° after 180 times of antifogging tests. The friction resistance of the coating was as high as 24 m. Moreover, the light transmittance was only reduced by 3%. Besides, they also had the excellent self-cleaning property. After being stored in the laboratory environment for 90 days, it can still maintain the hydrophilic property (WCA is about 5°). In general, the method proposed in this study is low-cost and eco-friendly, and can be widely used in the preparation of antifogging coatings.

483458,Poor sanitation and transmission of COVID-19 in Brazil,2021,"BACKGROUND: Protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) from COVID-19 is a global priority. Anova Health Institute (Anova) is the PEPFAR (US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) District Support Partner for the Johannesburg, Cape Town, Sedibeng, Capricorn and Mopani districts in South Africa, operating in public sector primary healthcare facilities. At the time of the emergence of COVID-19, Anova employed close to 4 000 people: 41% community health workers (CHWs), 23% data staff, 20% nurses and doctors, 12% management/support and 5% allied HCWs. OBJECTIVES: To describe rates of COVID-19 diagnosis in Anova-employed HCWs in five districts. METHODS: Employees exposed to, tested for or diagnosed with COVID-19 were required to report the event. These reports were compiled into a database to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the workforce. We kept a timeline of key events occurring at national and district level, including Anova's policies and their implementation, that was used to describe organisational response. We described the number of confirmed cases, cumulative incidence rates and testing rates, broken down by district and job category. We estimated expected deaths and the effect on time off work. RESULTS: Of Anova employees, 14% (n=562) were diagnosed with COVID-19 by the end of September 2020. Cumulative incidence was highest in Sedibeng (29%) and lowest in Mopani (5%). All HCWs experienced high incidences: data staff 17%, allied HCWs 16%, CHWs 14%, nurses and doctors 13%, and management/support 11%. At the peak of the epidemic, for 5 weeks, &gt;5% of employees were unable to work owing to exposure or infection, significantly disrupting service delivery. The additional administrative burden on managers was substantial. CONCLUSIONS: It is critical that all cadres of HCWs are protected in the workplace, including in primary care settings, where better structuresare needed to perform risk assessments and conduct outbreak investigations. CHWs and data staff may be at higher risk owing to poor infrastructure, limited power to negotiate working conditions, and limited experience of infection prevention and control. Their working conditions must be improved to reduce their risk.","Rees, K; Dunlop, J L; Patel-Abrahams, S; Struthers, H; McIntyre, J A",S Afr Med J,,383
483860,Long-term Recovery of Survivors of COVID-19 Treated with ECMO: The Next Imperative,2020,"COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China in December of 2019 and appeared in the United States 1 month later. Between the onset of the pandemic and January 13, 2021, over 92 million people have tested positive for the virus and over 1.9 million people have died globally. Virtually every country in the world has been impacted by this virus. Beginning in March 2020, many U.S. state governments enforced a ""quarantine"" to respond to the growing health crisis. Citizens were required to remain at home;schools, restaurants, and non-essential businesses were forced to close, and large gatherings were prohibited. Americans' lives were transformed in a span of days as daily routines were interrupted and people were shuttered indoors. Mounting fear and unpredictability coupled with widespread unemployment and social isolation escalated anxiety and impacted the mental health of millions across the globe. Most (53%) U.S. adults reported that the coronavirus outbreak has had a negative impact on their mental health, including inducing or exacerbating use of alcohol, drugs, gambling and overeating as coping mechanisms. In this paper, we will examine substance use and addictive behaviors that have been used to manage the stress and uncertainty wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. We review the changing treatment landscape as therapy pivoted online and telemedicine became the norm.","Avena, N. M.; Simkus, J.; Lewandowski, A.; Gold, M. S.; Potenza, M.

The persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in the context of clinical features and comorbidities is understudied. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 adult symptomatic cases at Mayo Clinic, eventually achieving cessation of viral RNA shedding (CVS), defined as two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR results on nasopharyngeal swabs collected at least 24â¯h apart. RESULTS: A total of 251 patients were included, median age was 53 years and 59 % female. The most common symptoms at diagnosis were cough, myalgia, dyspnea, fever and chills. Myalgia, cough, anosmia, ageusia and sore throat were common at CVS, but fever and dyspnea were not observed. The median time from symptom onset to CVS was 23 days, and did not differ by symptoms. The weekly cumulative CVS rate was 2, 14, 44, 73, 91 and 95 % at 1-6 weeks from symptom onset, respectively. Cough and fever were associated with a positive PCR test if tested within 2 weeks of symptoms (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). Patients with asthma or immunosuppression were less likely to achieve CVS if tested 3 weeks into symptoms (Pâ¯<â¯0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative CVS rate at 3 weeks from symptom-onset is 44 % in our entire cohort. The findings of our study highlight the low yield of repeating a SARS-CoV-2 NP PCR test within 21 days of a laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.","Corsini Campioli, Cristina; Cano Cevallos, Edison; Assi, Mariam; Patel, Robin; Binnicker, Matthew J; O039,; Horo, John C",J Clin Virol,,383

These infectious diseases may have several ocular manifestations and rarely might be the presenting symptom of the underlying disease. The eyes can act as a portal of entry and/or route of viral transmission for these pathogens. Therefore, an ophthalmologist/optometrist needs to act with ample preparedness and responsibility. Establishing a standard of care in ophthalmic practice by modifying the conventional examination techniques and adopting tele-ophthalmology model to triage the patients can control the community spread of the disease. This article aims to elucidate the ocular manifestations in these pandemics and measures that should be adopted in ophthalmic practice to prevent the disease transmission.","Dhiman, Rebika; Rakheja, Vaishali; Saxena, Rohit",J. optom.

485829,Association of COVID-19 with Anosmia and Hypogeusia,2020,"Clean air is a fundamental necessity for human health and well-being. Anthropogenic emissions that are harmful to human health have been reduced substantially under COVID-19 lockdown. Satellite remote sensing for air pollution assessments can be highly effective in public health research because of the possibility of estimating air pollution levels over large scales. In this study, we utilized both satellite and surface measurements to estimate air pollution levels in 20 cities across the world. Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) application were used for both spatial and time-series assessment of tropospheric Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) statuses during the study period (1 February to May 11, 2019 and the corresponding period in 2020). We also measured Population-Weighted Average Concentration (PWAC) of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and NO2 using gridded population data and in-situ air pollution estimates. We estimated the economic benefit of reduced anthropogenic emissions using two valuation approaches: (1) the median externality value coefficient approach, applied for satellite data, and (2) the public health burden approach, applied for in-situ data. Satellite data have shown that ~28 tons (sum of 20 cities) of NO2 and ~184 tons (sum of 20 cities) of CO have been reduced during the study period. PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 are reduced by ~37 (µg/m3), 62 (µg/m3), and 145 (µg/m3), respectively. A total of ~1310, ~401, and ~430 premature cause-specific deaths were estimated to be avoided with the reduction of NO2, PM2.5, and PM10. The total economic benefits (Billion US$) (sum of 20 cities) of the avoided mortality are measured as ~10, ~3.1, and ~3.3 for NO2, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively. In many cases, ground monitored data was found inadequate for detailed spatial assessment. This problem can be better addressed by incorporating satellite data into the evaluation if proper quality assurance is achieved, and the data processing burden can be alleviated or even removed. Both satellite and ground-based estimates suggest the positive effect of the limited human interference on the natural environments. Further research in this direction is needed to explore this synergistic association more explicitly.","Sannigrahi, Srikanta; Kumar, Prashant; Molter, Anna; Zhang, Qi; Basu, Bidroha; Basu, Arunima Sarkar; Pilla, Francesco",Environ Res,,383

Therefore, this study aims to develop a model to examine empirically how effectively complaints are handled to control customer retaliation and negative e-word of mouth (eWOM) in such a pandemic situation, where banking institutions are using social media as a key platform. Design/methodology/approach: A self-administered questionnaire was distributed among 309 participants who had encountered service failure and experienced complaint handling on Facebook. This study draws upon prevailing literature to test a series of hypotheses through structural equation modeling. Findings: The findings show that effective complaint handling has a negative influence on customer retaliation in the social media environment. As a result, customer retaliation was found to have a positive association with negative eWOM. Therefore, this study has revealed that effective complaint handling will lead to decrease in customer retaliation and negative eWOM. Practical implications: This study carries an understanding of effective complaint handling efforts by leading banks in the social media environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study recommends that customized and effective efforts by the banks can influence customer retaliation and negative e-WOM. Originality/value: The study is conducted during COVID-19 pandemic considering the impact of COVID-19 on banking sector, which is a new phenomenon.

487278,Characteristics of deaths amongst health workers in China during the outbreak of COVID-19 infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a new pandemic, and its impact by HIV status is unknown. National reporting does not include gender identity, therefore data are absent on the impact of COVID-19 on transgender people, including those with HIV. Baseline data from the American Cohort to Study HIV Acquisition Among Transgender Women in High Risk Areas (LITE) Study provide an opportunity to examine pre-COVID factors that may increase vulnerability to COVID-19 related harms among transgender women. SETTING: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Miami, New York City, Washington, DC METHODS:: Baseline data from LITE were analysed for demographic, psychosocial, and material factors that may affect vulnerability to COVID-related harms. RESULTS: The 1020 participants had high rates of poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, homelessness, and sex work. Transgender women with HIV (n=273) were older, more likely to be Black, had lower educational attainment, and were more likely to experience material hardship. Mental and behavioural health symptoms were common and did not differ by HIV status. Barriers to healthcare included being mistreated, provider discomfort serving transgender women, and past negative experiences; as well as material hardships, such as cost and transportation. However, most reported access to material and social support - demonstrating resilience. CONCLUSIONS: Transgender women with HIV may be particularly vulnerable to pandemic harms. Mitigating this harm would benefit everyone, given the highly infectious nature of this coronavirus. Collecting gender identity in COVID-19 data is crucial to inform an effective public health response. Transgender-led organizations' response to this crisis serve as an important model for effective community-led interventions.","Poteat, Tonia C; Reisner, Sari L; Miller, Marissa; Wirtz, Andrea L",,,383
488434,"Lactate dehydrogenase, COVID-19 and mortality",2021,"OBJECTIVE: This study clarifies the incidence of prolactin-producing pituitary adenomas without hyperprolactinemia and determines the appropriate treatment strategy for these tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis focused on prolactin-producing adenomas without hyperprolactinemia, which were initially treated by surgery as nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. Among 942 patients with histologically confirmed pituitary adenoma, 114 (12.1 %) patients, consisting of 68 men and 46 women, who had prolactin-producing adenomas without hyperprolactinemia were identified between April 2005 and March 2019. RESULTS: Of the 114 patients identified, 13 (11.4 %) had prolactin mono-expressions, 18 (15.8 %) had pit-1 lineage hormonal expressions, and 83 (72.8 %) had paradoxical immunoexpression out of the pituitary differentiation lineage, including prolactin. During the follow-up period, 19 patients suffered tumor progression, and 14 required salvage treatment. Of the 19 patients, 11 underwent gamma knife radiosurgery, and none of them experienced further tumor progression. Cabergoline was administered of them to six patients, and one achieved tumor shrinkage. However, the remaining five patients who were treated with cabergoline suffered further tumor progression and required another salvage treatment. Among the patients in the prolactin mono-expression group, one experienced tumor regrowth and underwent gamma knife radiosurgery. In the pit-1 lineage group, two patients experienced tumor regrowth. One had further tumor progression after treatment with cabergoline and underwent gamma knife radiosurgery. Among the patients in the paradoxical immunoexpression group, 16 suffered tumor progression. Four patients underwent further surgery, seven patients were treated with gamma knife radiosurgery, and one patient received fractionated irradiation. None of the eight patients who were treated with gamma knife radiosurgery and fractionated irradiation showed further tumor progression. Four patients in this group were treated with cabergoline, but they all suffered further tumor progression and underwent additional salvage treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Out of the pituitary differentiation lineage, paradoxical hormonal expression occurred in three-quarters of the patients identified. Further surgery or gamma knife radiosurgery should be given priority in times of tumor progression because most patients were resistant to dopamine agonists.","Ogawa, Yoshikazu; Tominaga, Teiji",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,,383

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on university students' dietary intake, physical activity, and sedentary behaviour. Participants were students (n = 125) from the Universities of Saskatchewan and Regina. An online questionnaire was administered retrospectively (for prepandemic) and prospectively (during the pandemic) to examine students' dietary intake, physical activity, and sedentary behaviour. Overall, nutrient and caloric intakes were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) during the pandemic, and alcohol intake increased (p = 0.03). Before the pandemic, 16% and 54% of the participants were meeting the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Adults (18-64 years) of 150 min of moderate-vigorous physical activity and 8 h or less of sedentary activity, respectively. Only 10% met the guidelines for physical activity while 30% met the guidelines for sedentary behaviour during the pandemic. The minutes per week spent engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity during the pandemic decreased by approximately 20% (p < 0.001). The hours spent in sedentary activities increased by 3 h per day (p < 0.001). Our findings confirm that during the pandemic, students' inadequate dietary intake, high alcohol consumption, low physical activity, and high sedentary behaviour were significantly compounded. Novelty: During COVID-19, the nutrient and caloric intakes of university students decreased, and alcohol intake increased significantly. University students' physical activity levels decreased, and sedentary activity increased significantly during COVID-19. During COVID-19 students did not engage in sufficient physical activity to offset the increased sedentary behaviour.","Bertrand, Leandy; Shaw, Keely A; Ko, Jongbum; Deprez, Dalton; Chilibeck, Philip D; Zello, Gordon A",Appl Physiol Nutr Metab,,383

489810,Reflections on the upsurge of virtual cancer conferences during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The analogy of South Africa as an ailing “organism” afflicted by chronic socioeconomic inequality is apt as it captures the nation’s manifest endemic abrasions and frailties, especially as it relates to the lived experience of its most vulnerable citizens (the precariat). COVID-19 has accentuated the plight of the poor, yet political rhetoric professes that the pandemic does not discriminate. In this article I offer an analysis of the intricate relationship between politics, economics, and education in the South African context. I argue that these are indeed complexly connected social “phenomena” that have particular variant manifestations and implications for South African citizens. While I recognise that health is also implicated in this matrix, it is beyond the scope of this article to examine this crucial social provision in any detail. I contend that in attempting to understand how COVID-19 impacts South African society, it is important to firstly analyse the prevailing (pre-COVID) status quo, especially as it relates to socio-economic inequality, as the effects of the pandemic impact the lived experience of people on the indigent-affluent continuum in starkly distinct ways. The pandemic has brought into sharp purview the accentuated nature of human adversity in the South African context and the social justice peculiarities plaguing South African society. Methodologically, I attempt a Foucauldian analysis of the contemporary political-economy-education matrix to reveal how fundamental neoliberal tenets have fashioned South African society and its education system into a dualism in which poverty and affluence co-exist. I attempt to move beyond constructions of deprivation, strife and adversity to reflect on resistance and the resilience (technologies of the self) that human beings summon in the face of crisis. Secondly, I examine the impact of the pandemic at localised school level to reveal its material effects on poor schools. © The Author(s) 2021.","Maistry, S.",Education as Change,,383
489830,Neurological manifestations in COVID-19: A narrative review,2020,"Objective: To investigate the performance of real-time RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: Laboratory test data and basic case information of Henan COVID-19 cases were collected from the China's Infectious Disease Information System as of March 5, 2020. All information was entered by local hospitals and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Local hospitals or country CDC were responsible for sampling and municipal CDC was responsible for nucleic acid testing. Results: A total of 6 714 specimens were detected and the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 23.82%. The specimens were collected from 1 200 confirmed cases, 2 178 suspected cases and 77 asymptomatic cases. The nucleic acid diagnosis rate of COVID-19 was 36.96% (1 277/3 455). In all cases, the positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in nasal swabs, sputum samples and throat swabs were 19.38%, 28.59% and 23.53%, respectively (χ2=15.896, P&lt;0.01). The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in confirmed COVID-19 cases was 63.10%. The positive rates in nasal swabs, sputum samples and throat swabs were 50.80%, 58.71% and 65.21 (χ2=18.612, P&lt;0.01). The positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid were 43.51%, 23.98%, 22.82%, 12.17%, 14.46% and 13.21% in samples collected on the day of symptom onset and one week, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, five weeks and above five weeks after the onset, respectively. The positive rates in confirmed cases were respectively 89.03%, 86.57%, 52.30%, 17.53%, 17.69% and 24.14% at those time points. Conclusions: Real-time RT-PCR is the most effective method for early pathogenic diagnosis of COVID-19. The highest detection rate of nucleic acid is achieved within one week after the onset of COVID-19, and the latest time for nucleic acid detection is 38 d after the onset.","Ma, Hongxia; Pan, Jingjing; Li, Yi; Ye, Ying; Zhang, Baifan; Wang, Haifeng; Zhao, Jiayong; You, Aiguo; Xu, Jin; Huang, Xueyong",Chin.

490321,Frequency of HLA alleles among COVID-19 infected patients: Preliminary data from Saudi Arabia,2021,"The longevity of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, and the devastating effects it has had on certain subsets of individuals thus far has highlighted the importance of identifying blood-based biomarkers associated with disease severity. We employed computational and transcriptome analyses of publicly available datasets from PBMCs from 126 patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU (n=50), COVID-19 not admitted to ICU (n=50), non-COVID-19 admitted to ICU (n=16) and non-COVID-19 not admitted to ICU (n=10), and utilized the Gencode V33 assembly to analyze protein coding mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcriptomes in the context of disease severity. Our data identified several aberrantly expressed mRNA and lncRNA based biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 severity, which in turn significantly affected canonical, upstream, and disease functions in each group of patients. Immune, interferon, and antiviral responses were severely suppressed in COVID-19 admitted to ICU versus COVID-19 who were not admitted to ICU. Our data suggests a possible therapeutic approach for severe COVID-19 through administration of interferon therapy. Delving further into these biomarkers, roles and their implications on the onset and disease severity of COVID-19 could play a crucial role in patient stratification and identifying varied therapeutic options with diverse clinical implications.","Shaath, Hibah; Alajez, Nehad M",Heliyon,,383

Among 287 mucormycosis patients, 187 (65.2%) had CAM; CAM prevalence was 0.27% among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We noted a 2.1-fold rise in mucormycosis during the study period compared with September-December 2019. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus was the most common underlying disease among CAM and non-CAM patients. COVID-19 was the only underlying disease in 32.6% of CAM patients. COVID-19-related hypoxemia and improper glucocorticoid use independently were associated with CAM. The mucormycosis case-fatality rate at 12 weeks was 45.7% but was similar for CAM and non-CAM patients. Age, rhino-orbital-cerebral involvement, and intensive care unit admission were associated with increased mortality rates; sequential antifungal drug treatment improved mucormycosis survival. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increases in mucormycosis in India, partly from inappropriate glucocorticoid use.","Patel, Atul; Agarwal, Ritesh; Rudramurthy, Shivaprakash M; Shevkani, Manoj; Xess, Immaculata; Sharma, Ratna; Savio, Jayanthi; Sethuraman, Nandini; Madan, Surabhi; Shastri, Prakash; Thangaraju, Deepak; Marak, Rungmei; Tadepalli, Karuna; Savaj, Pratik; Sunavala, Ayesha; Gupta, Neha; Singhal, Tanu; Muthu, Valliappan; Chakrabarti, Arunaloke",Emerg. infect. dis,,383

It is essential to detect the disease quickly and immediately to isolate the infected individuals. Nevertheless, the current widely used PCR and immunoassay-based methods suffer from false negative results and delays in diagnosis. Herein, a high-throughput serum peptidome profiling method based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is developed for efficient detection of COVID-19. We analyzed the serum samples from 146 COVID-19 patients and 152 control cases (including 73 non-COVID-19 patients with similar clinical symptoms, 33 tuberculosis patients, and 46 healthy individuals). After MS data processing and feature selection, eight machine learning methods were used to build classification models. A logistic regression machine learning model with 25 feature peaks achieved the highest accuracy (99%), with sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 100%, for the detection of COVID-19. This result demonstrated a great potential of the method for screening, routine surveillance, and diagnosis of COVID-19 in large populations, which is an important part of the pandemic control.","Yan, Ling; Yi, Jia; Huang, Changwu; Zhang, Jian; Fu, Shuhui; Li, Zhijie; Lyu, Qian; Xu, Yuan; Wang, Kun; Yang, Huan; Ma, Qingwei; Cui, Xiaoping; Qiao, Liang; Sun, Wei; Liao, Pu",Anal Chem,,383

Management of maxillofacial injuries, especially isolated mandibular fractures by surgical methods, became near impossibility because of the restrictions and other concerns related to the pandemic. Methods: The individuals who suffered isolated mandibular fracture because of trauma were included, to undergo conservative treatment methods with adaptations for the pandemic. Individuals with multiple bone fractures were excluded, and the selected patients were given the choice to opt out from this treatment plan. We followed a more conservative approach with adaptations, which we have discussed in this article. Result: The fracture healing for all the patients was as expected, and none of our team members got infected with this virus from exposure to patients. Conclusion: The adaptations helped in limiting the possible exposure of patients, relatives and health care providers to the virus and addressed other pressing concerns related to this pandemic. We present the guideline that we formulated in our unit, which we used to manage the patients who reported to us with isolated mandibular fractures during the ongoing pandemic.","Selvaraj, Daniel Sathiya Sundaram; Oommen, Ajish George; Jenifer, D; Vinitha, G; Ebenezer, Jagadish",J Maxillofac Oral Surg,,383

OBJECTIVE: To explore the psychology of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization. METHODS: A phenomenological and robust sampling approach was employed. Sixteen patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology with COVID-19 from 20th January to 1st March 2020 were selected. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, phone calls, or face-to-face interviews using quarantine measures. Data were analyzed using the Colaizzi method. RESULTS: The psychological experience of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization could be summarized into five themes. Firstly, attitudes toward the disease included fear, denial, and stigma during the early stages, which gradually developed into acceptance in the later stages. Secondly, the major source of stress included the viral nature of the disease, quarantine measures, and concerns regarding the health of family members. Thirdly, reactions of body and mind included disease stage-dependent emotional responses, excessive attention to symptoms, rumination, and changes in diet, sleep, and behavior. Fourthly, supportive factors included psychological adjustments, medical care, and family and social support. Finally, the disease resulted in psychological growth and patients viewed problems with gratitude through the cherishing of life, family, bravery, and tenacity. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients gradually changed their attitude toward the disease and displayed emotional responses dependent on the stage of the disease. Negative emotions dominated during the early stages but gradually gave way to mixed positive and negative emotions. Active guidance of psychological growth may therefore promote physical and mental recovery in COVID-19 patients.","Sun, Niuniu; Wei, Luoqun; Wang, Hongyun; Wang, Xianru; Gao, Mingxia; Hu, Xinjun; Shi, Suling",J Affect Disord,,383

METHODS: National data were used to calculate the weekly and monthly CFRs, stratified by three age groups: 0-64, 65-79, and 80+ years. We also calculated the standardized mortality ratios (SMR) to offset the differences in age composition. RESULTS: The epidemic consisted of the initial wave, a trough in June, and two conjoined summer waves, yielding 17206 coronavirus disease 2019 cases and 290 deaths. While the number of confirmed cases nearly quadrupled during summer, case fatality estimates decreased; CFR in spring was 4.81 (95% confidence interval 3.91-5.71), compared with 1.24 (1.06-1.42) in summer. The SMR for summer was 0.45 (0.37-0.55), suggesting that the case fatality risk halved compared with spring. Cardiovascular comorbidity was an important risk factor for case fatality (SMR 2.63 [2.20-3.13] during spring and 1.28 [1.02-1.59] during summer). The risk of death in ventilated patients remained unchanged (SMR 0.98 [0.77-1.24]). CONCLUSIONS: The epidemic dynamics suggests summer decline in case fatality, except in ventilated patients. While the effect of comorbidity also decreased, cardiovascular comorbidity remained an important risk factor for death even during summer. A plethora of possible confounders and an ever-changing landscape of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Croatia require constant monitoring and evaluation, with an aim to prevent the uncontrolled spread of the virus and a disruption of health care functioning.","Kristic, Ivica; Pehlic, Marina; Pavlovic, Mirjana; Kolaric, Branko; Kolcic, Ivana; Polasek, Ozren",Croat Med J,,383

The difference in the peripheral oxygen saturation in sitting and supine positions, documented as a routine standard of care, especially in patients with platypnea, was calculated and demographic details and co-morbidities were noted from indoor record forms.","Tanya, Athavale Amita Athavale Vijay Khatri Dimple Makhija Maya Mortale Surabhi Jaggi Milind Nadkar Hemant Deshmukh",Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,,383
495965,COVID-19: experiences of lockdown and support needs in children and young adults with kidney conditions,2021,"Aims: The UK government declared a national lockdown on 23 March 2020 to reduce transmission of COVID-19. This study aims to identify the effect of lockdown on the rates, types, mechanisms, and mortality of musculoskeletal trauma across Scotland. Methods: Data for all musculoskeletal trauma requiring operative treatment were collected prospectively from five key orthopaedic units across Scotland during lockdown (23 March 2020 to 28 May 2020). This was compared with data for the same timeframe in 2019 and 2018. Data collected included all cases requiring surgery, injury type, mechanism of injury, and inpatient mortality. Results: A total of 1,315 patients received operative treatment from 23 March 2020 to 28 May 2020 compared with 1,791 in 2019 and 1,719 in 2018. The numbers of all injury types decreased, but the relative frequency of hip fractures increased (36.3% in 2020 vs 30.2% in 2019, p < 0.0001 and 30.7% in 2018, p < 0.0001). Significant increases were seen in the proportion of DIY-related injuries (3.1% in 2020 vs 1.7% in 2019, p = 0.012 and 1.6% in 2018, p < 0.005) and injuries caused by falls (65.6% in 2020 vs 62.6% in 2019, p = 0.082 and 61.9% in 2018, p = 0.047). Significant decreases were seen in the proportion of road traffic collisions (2.6% in 2020 vs 5.4% in 2019, p < 0.0001 and 4.2% in 2018, p = 0.016), occupational injuries (1.8% in 2020 vs 3.0% in 2019, p = 0.025 and 2.3% in 2018, p = 0.012) and infections (6.8% in 2020 vs 7.8% in 2019, p = 0.268 and 10.3% in 2018, p < 0.012). Cycling injuries increased (78 in 2020 vs 64 in 2019 vs 42 in 2018). A significant increase in the proportion of self-harm injuries was seen (1.7% in 2020 vs 1.1% in 2019, p = 0.185 and 0.5% in 2018, p < 0.0001). Mortality of trauma patients was significantly higher in 2020 (5.0%) than in 2019 (2.8%, p = 0.002) and 2018 (1.8%, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: The UK COVID-19 lockdown has resulted in a marked reduction in musculoskeletal trauma patients undergoing surgery in Scotland. There have been significant changes in types and mechanisms of injury and, concerningly, mortality of trauma patients has risen significantly.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-9:541-548.","MacDonald, David R W; Neilly, David W; Davies, Peter S E; Crome, Christopher R; Jamal, Bilal; Gill, Sarah L; Jariwala, Arpit C; Stevenson, Iain M; Ashcroft, G Patrick",Bone Jt Open,,383
496469,COVID-19-related thyroiditis: A novel disease entity?,2021,"Motivation: Exploring drug-protein interactions (DPIs) work as a pivotal step in drug discovery. The fast expansion of available biological data enables computational methods effectively assist in experimental methods. Among them, deep learning methods extract features only from basic characteristics, such as protein sequences, molecule structures. Others achieve significant improvement by learning from not only sequences/molecules but the protein-protein and drug-drug associations (PPAs and DDAs). The PPAs and DDAs are generally obtained by using computational methods. However, existing computational methods have some limitations, resulting in low-quality PPAs and DDAs that hamper the prediction performance. Therefore, we hope to develop a novel supervised learning method to learn the PPAs and DDAs effectively and thereby improve the prediction performance of the specific task of DPI. Results: In this research, we propose a novel deep learning framework, namely BridgeDPI. BridgeDPI introduces a class of nodes named hyper-nodes, which bridge different proteins/drugs to work as PPAs and DDAs. The hyper-nodes can be supervised learned for the specific task of DPI since the whole process is an end-to-end learning. Consequently, such a model would improve prediction performance of DPI. In three real-world datasets, we further demonstrate that BridgeDPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the hyper-nodes. Last, in an independent verification, BridgeDPI explores the candidate bindings among COVID-19's proteins and various antiviral drugs. And the predictive results accord with the statement of the World Health Organization and Food and Drug Administration, showing the validity and reliability of BridgeDPI.","Wu, Yifan; Gao, Min; Zeng, Min; Chen, Feiyang; Li, Min; Zhang, Jie",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.12547v1.pdf,383

It describes how telerehabilitation can be leveraged to fill in the gaps in service, training, and research arms of the physical medicine and rehabilitation specialty. The ITAWAG (""to call"") telerehabilitation program is the response of the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at Philippine General Hospital, which is the country's national university hospital, to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis that continues to limit face-to-face access to physical medicine and rehabilitation services throughout the country. With the significant decline in the number of patients served since the start of the pandemic, the ITAWAG program aimed to bridge the physical distance between patients and clinicians after a set of eligibility criteria for teleconsultation or teletherapy and a step-by-step process used before, during, and after each virtual encounter. However, because many physical medicine and rehabilitation consultants, residents, and therapists were not trained for the virtual approach to patient care, a telerehabilitation curriculum was developed to help in providing quality and competent services. Finally, despite the growing awareness of telerehabilitation throughout the country, several research gaps about this emerging technology are identified to determine its acceptance, applicability, and cost-effectiveness among others.","Leochico, Carl Froilan D; Mojica, Jose Alvin P; Rey-Matias, Reynaldo R; Supnet, Isabella E; Ignacio, Sharon D",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,,383

Innovative use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe to perform TTE for such patients has been described; but reproducibility and correlation of the TTE measurements by this technique with those obtained by the standard supine TTE study are still unknown. METHODS: We enrolled 30 non-COVID-19 individuals, with a mean (SD) age 35 (10.9) years and 11 females, to study the agreement between the transthoracic measurements of the left ventricular (LV), left atrial (LA), aortic dimensions, and ejection fraction (EF) obtained in prone position using an external TEE probe versus the standard supine position using the conventional TTE probe. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, septal wall thickness, posterior wall thickness, and aortic root dimensions in the prone versus the supine positions, while the mean EF (60.3% vs 63.1%, P = .014) and mean LA dimensions (1.8 vs 1.9 cm/m2 , P < .001) were significantly lower in the prone position. The mean time of scans was significantly longer in the prone as compared to the supine position (12.5 vs 4.5 minutes, P < .001). All supine studies had good quality while in the prone position four studies were of poor quality, and one was nondiagnostic. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of cardiac dimensions and systolic function in the prone position using transthoracic TEE probe was feasible. LV and aortic dimensions agreed well with the standard TTE in supine position; however, LA dimensions and EF were lower in the prone position.","Taha, Hesham S; Mohamed, Ahmed M; Mahrous, Hossam A; Shaker, Mirna M; Alsayed, Osama S; Sayed, Hadeer G; Rizk, Hussien H; Abdelwahab, Mohamed A",Echocardiography,,383

The aim of this research is to study early psychological responses to the pandemic in the Spanish general population, focusing on gender differences. METHODS: Nine to 14 days after the declaration of a state of emergency an online survey was conducted assessing sociodemographic, health, behavioral and COVID-19-related variables. Mental health status was evaluated by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Self-Care Scale (SCS). RESULTS: The study included 3520 respondents: 2611 women and 909 men. Women scored significantly higher in DASS-21 and IES-R (p &lt; 0.05) and were more likely to somatize, suffer from hypochondriasis, sleeping disturbances and claustrophobia (p &lt; 0.05). Being a woman can be considered a risk factor for intrusive thoughts, avoidance mechanisms, stress and anxiety (Odd Ratio = 2.7/2.3/2.3/1.6). The risk of presenting posttraumatic symptoms and emotional distress was greater in women (Odd Ratio = 6.77/4.59). General linear models to predict IES-R and DASS-21 scores clarified which variables were gender specific, such as main concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that at early stages of the pandemic, women mental health was more impacted and that both genders show different concerns. Gender perspective in secondary and tertiary prevention strategies must be taken into account when facing the distress associated with the pandemic.","Del Rio-Casanova, L.; Sanchez-Martin, M.; Garcia-Dantas, A.; Gonzalez-Vazquez, A.; Justo, A.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],,383

There is no conclusive research into the risk of COVID-19 transmission associated with nasogastric tube insertion, although evidence from the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak appears to suggest that there is no increased risk of transmission. However, close contact with a COVID-19 patient, especially those displaying respiratory symptoms, is likely to increase the risk of transmission. Nasogastric tube insertion requires increased time spent at a patient's bedside and can also cause pharyngeal irritation, resulting in coughing. In addition, the nasogastric tube can expose the healthcare worker to potentially infectious saliva. Therefore, there is a clear need for increased evidence regarding the risk of transmission associated with nasogastric tube insertion, to ensure that such risks can be mitigated.","Sturrock, Beattie Rh; Fanning, Sinead J; Khan, Mansoor; Sajid, Muhammad S",Br J Hosp Med (Lond),,383

In tracing these effects through recent changes in amputation protocols and less spectacular conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder, I show that the prevalent model of ""veteran therapeutics,"" which posits cure as the aim of post-war, has perverse and cruel effects. Drawing on disability theory, I explore alternative ways to read the frictions that soldiers and veterans experience, stretched between the medical model of veteran therapeutics and an emergent sense that cure may be an impossible goal. Alternatively, the article turns to moments when veterans learn to live with disability, rather than living in anticipation of its end. Though small, such moments contain possibilities for a less cruel mode of inhabiting disability, offering incipient signs of what we might call a crip art of failure.","Wool, Zoë H",Med. anthropol. q,,383

Here, we recount patient stories illustrative of this isolation, generated by insufficient professional interpreter use, ad hoc interpretation, and scarcity of media in preferred languages. When confronted with the social isolation faced by all patients during COVID-19, we more clearly saw the healthcare disparities affecting patients with LEP. A trainee-led videoconferencing initiative facilitating social calls between patients at UCSF and their loved ones proved especially helpful in reducing the disconnection that patients with LEP experience in the hospital. Motivated by the findings of this project, we advocate for other institutions to take similar action, such as hiring inpatient telehealth navigators and providing tablets for ad lib use. Enacting these changes will keep patients with LEP connected to their families and communities while in the hospital, an essential step towards establishing an equitable experience for patients with LEP.","Kucirek, Natalie K; Thomas, Nicholas J; Norman, Joshua S; Athavale, Priyanka; Jaradeh, Katrin; Hsiang, Esther Y; Malevanchik, Lev",J. gen. intern. med,,383

A deep understanding of the variation of biological characteristics in severe COVID-19 patients is crucial for the detection of individuals at high risk of critical condition for the clinical management of the disease. Herein, by profiling the gene expression spectrum deduced from DNA coverage in regions surrounding transcriptional start site in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of COVID-19 patients, we deciphered the altered biological processes in the severe cases and demonstrated the feasibility of cfDNA in measuring the COVID-19 progression. The up- and downregulated genes in the plasma of severe patient were found to be closely related to the biological processes and functions affected by COVID-19 progression. More importantly, with the analysis of transcriptome data of blood cells and lung cells from control group and cases with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we revealed that the upregulated genes were predominantly involved in the viral and antiviral activity in blood cells, reflecting the intense viral replication and the active reaction of immune system in the severe patients. Pathway analysis of downregulated genes in plasma DNA and lung cells also demonstrated the diminished adenosine triphosphate synthesis function in lung cells, which was evidenced to correlate with the severe COVID-19 symptoms, such as a cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress. Overall, this study revealed tissue involvement, provided insights into the mechanism of COVID-19 progression, and highlighted the utility of cfDNA as a noninvasive biomarker for disease severity inspections.","Chen, X.; Wu, T.; Li, L.; Lin, Y.; Ma, Z.; Xu, J.; Li, H.; Cheng, F.; Chen, R.; Sun, K.; Luo, Y.; Zhang, C.; Chen, F.; Wang, J.; Kuo, T.; Li, X.; Geng, C.; Lin, F.; Huang, C.; Hu, J.; Yin, J.; Liu, M.; Tao, Y.; Zhang, J.; Ou, R.; Zheng, F.; Jin, Y.; Yang, H.; Xu, X.; Fu, S.; Jiang, H.; Jin, X.; Zhang, H.",Frontiers in Genetics,,383

Very recently, it has been demonstrated that their photothermal conversion can be boosted by appending rather long alkyl chains. Despite this behavior being tentatively associated with the population of a nonradiative twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state driven by an intramolecular motion, the precise mechanisms and the role played by the environment, and most notably aggregation, still remain elusive. In this context, we carried out a series of time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to achieve a realistic description of the isolated and aggregated systems. Our theoretical models unambiguously evidence that the population of CT states is very unlikely in both cases, whereas the light-triggered heat dissipation can be ascribed to the activation of specific vibrational degrees of freedom related to the relative motion of the peripheral chains. Overall, our results clearly corroborate the active role played by the alkyl substituents in the photothermal conversion through vibrational motion, while breaking from the conventional picture, which invokes the formation of dark TICT states in loosely packed aggregates.","Diez-Cabanes, Valentin; Monari, Antonio; Pastore, Mariachiara",J. phys. chem.

We evaluated whether each of these systems effectively stratifies cases and for agreement between approaches in order to inform departmental policy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated triage of elective cases postponed within our department due to the COVID-19 pandemic (March 9, 2020 to May 22, 2020) using questionnaire based surgical prioritization (American College of Surgeons MeNTS instrument), consensus/expert opinion based surgical prioritization (based on a published urological recommendations) and individual surgeon based surgical prioritization scoring (developed and managed within our department). Lower scores represented greater urgency. MeNTS scores were compared across consensus/expert opinion based surgical prioritization and individual surgeon based surgical prioritization scores. RESULTS: A total of 204 cases were evaluated. Median MeNTS score was 50 (IQR 44-55), and mean consensus/expert opinion based surgical prioritization and individual surgeon based surgical prioritization scores were 2.6±0.6 and 2.2±0.8, respectively. Median MeNTS scores were 52 (46.5, 57.5), 50 (44.5, 54.5) and 48 (43.5, 54) for individual surgeon based surgical prioritization priority 1, 2 and 3 cases (p=0.129), and 55 (51.5, 57), 47.5 (42, 56) and 49 (44, 54) for consensus/expert opinion based surgical prioritization priority scores 1, 2, and 3 (p=0.002). There was none to slight agreement between consensus/expert opinion based surgical prioritization and individual surgeon based surgical prioritization scores (Kappa 0.131, p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Questionnaire based, expert opinion based and individual surgeon based approaches to case prioritization result in significantly different case prioritization. Questionnaire based surgical prioritization did not meaningfully stratify urological cases, and consensus/expert opinion based surgical prioritization and individual surgeon based surgical prioritization frequently disagreed. The strengths and weaknesses of each of these systems should be considered in future disaster planning scenarios.","Cohn, Joshua A; Ghiraldi, Eric M; Uzzo, Robert G; Simhan, Jay",J Urol,,383

Hereby, the most profitable medicines can be suggested. METHODS: The mesh terms of ""COVID-19 drug treatment"" (Supplementary Concept) and ""COVID-19 drug treatment"" were sequentially utilized as search strategies in Medline and Science direct on October 18, 2020. Searches were confined to systematic reviews/meta-analyses. The Cochrane database was searched on November 1, 2020 with ""COVID."" With adding up four articles from other resources, 84 systematic reviews were considered for initial screening. Finally, 22 articles fulfilled the criteria and were assessed using PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Increasing number of clinical trials from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are not only profitable but also deleterious. Lopinavir/ritonavir failed to maintain their initial efficacy in improving clinical symptoms and mortality rate. Steroids and tocilizumab were suggested in patients with intensely severe symptoms. Steroids reduced mechanical ventilation and death in severely ill patients. Plasma or immunoglobulins effects are absolutely controversial. Favorable impressions of remdesivir have been relied on for the early onset of this drug. Hypotension and abnormal liver function tests were realized as its side effects. Favipiravir has resulted in a higher viral clearance than remdesivir. However, this claim needs to be proved with subsequent clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, remdesivir and favipiravir are advantageous drugs that should be administered in the early phases. Their side effects are not well known and need to be found in the following research projects. Steroids and tocilizumab have been considered beneficial in the cytokine storm phase.","Kheirabadi, Dorna; Haddad, Fatemeh; Mousavi-Roknabadi, Razieh S; Rezaeisadrabadi, Mohammad; Dehghan, Hamidreza; Fazlzadeh, Aylar",J Med Virol,,383

Strong associations have tied tacrolimus intrapatient variability (IPV) to degree of nonadherence and high tacrolimus IPV to clinical endpoints such as rejection and allograft loss. Nonadherence is a dynamic, complex problem best targeted by multidimensional interventions, including mobile health (mHealth) technologies. METHODS: This was a secondary planned analysis of a 12-month, parallel, 2-arm, semiblind, 1:1 randomized controlled trial involving 136 adult kidney transplant recipients. The primary aims of the TRANSAFE Rx study were to assess the efficacy of a pharmacist-led, mHealth-based intervention in improving medication safety and health outcomes for kidney transplant recipients as compared to usual care. RESULTS: Patients were randomized equally to 68 patients per arm. The intervention arm demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in tacrolimus IPV over time as compared to the control arm (P = 0.0133). When analyzing a clinical goal of tacrolimus IPV of less than 30%, the 2 groups were comparable at baseline (P = 0.765), but significantly more patients in the intervention group met this criterion at month 12 (P = 0.033). In multivariable modeling, variables that independently impacted tacrolimus IPV included time, treatment effect, age, and warm ischemic time. CONCLUSION: This secondary planned analysis of an mHealth-based, pharmacist-led intervention demonstrated an association between the active intervention in the trial and improved tacrolimus IPV. Further prospective studies are required to confirm the mutability of tacrolimus IPV and impact of reducing tacrolimus IPV on long-term clinical outcomes.","Fleming, James N; Gebregziabher, Mulugeta; Posadas, Aurora; Su, Zemin; McGillicuddy, John W; Taber, David J",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,383

Researchers from different parts of the world have employed diverse approaches to create a safe and effective vaccine as it saves millions of lives. Vaccines are created from the viral particle to train the body for a natural defense against invading pathogens. It is important to understand the concept of the vaccine design, especially the multi-epitope T-cells subunit vaccine. Methods: In this regard, we employed bioinformatics and immunoinformatic tools to illustrate the concept of the computer-based vaccine design. The computational methods consist of evaluation and selection of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, prediction of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes, prediction of helper T-cell (HTL) epitope, multi-epitope vaccine candidate construct, antigenicity and allergenicity prediction of the designed candidate vaccine, physiochemical properties and solubility evaluation, secondary/tertiary structure prediction, refinement and validation of model vaccine tertiary structure, molecular docking of fusion proteins and Toll-like receptor 9 protein, and in silico cloning of the vaccine. Results: A total of 454 amino acid sequences were generated from CTL and HTL epitopes. The query solubility value (QuerySol) of the vaccine construct was 0.419, including the human beta-defensin-2 adjuvant and peptide linkers. A circular clone of vaccine and pEX-C-His plasmid was achieved after in silico ligation using the annealed primer. Conclusion: Here, we provide essential information on computer-assisted multi-epitopes T-cell subunit vaccine design.","Yahaya, A. A.; Sanusi, S.; Malo, F.

A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) - the causal agent in COVID-19 - affects olfaction directly, by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing demonstrated that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell sequencing revealed that ACE2 is expressed in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells, rather than in neurons. Immunostaining confirmed these results and revealed pervasive expression of ACE2 protein in dorsally-located olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells and olfactory bulb pericytes in the mouse. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients.","Brann, David H; Tsukahara, Tatsuya; Weinreb, Caleb; Lipovsek, Marcela; Van den Berge, Koen; Gong, Boying; Chance, Rebecca; Macaulay, Iain C; Chou, Hsin-Jung; Fletcher, Russell B; Das, Diya; Street, Kelly; de Bezieux, Hector Roux; Choi, Yoon-Gi; Risso, Davide; Dudoit, Sandrine; Purdom, Elizabeth; Mill, Jonathan; Hachem, Ralph Abi; Matsunami, Hiroaki; Logan, Darren W; Goldstein, Bradley J; Grubb, Matthew S; Ngai, John; Datta, Sandeep Robert",Sci.

METHODS: Synthesizing data from various government and nonprofit institutions for all 3142 United States (US) counties, we studied county-level characteristics that were associated with cumulative and weekly case and death rates through 12/21/2020. We used generalized linear mixed models to model cumulative and weekly (40 repeated measures per county) cases and deaths. Cumulative and weekly models included state fixed effects and county-specific random effects. Weekly models additionally allowed covariate effects to vary by season and included US Census region-specific B-splines to adjust for temporal trends. RESULTS: Rural counties, counties with more minorities and white/non-white segregation, and counties with more people with no high school diploma and with medical comorbidities were associated with higher cumulative COVID-19 case and death rates. In the spring, urban counties and counties with more minorities and white/non-white segregation were associated with increased weekly case and death rates. In the fall, rural counties were associated with larger weekly case and death rates. In the spring, summer, and fall, counties with more residents with socioeconomic disadvantage and medical comorbidities were associated greater weekly case and death rates. CONCLUSIONS: These county-level associations are based off complete data from the entire country, come from a single modeling framework that longitudinally analyzes the US COVID-19 pandemic at the county-level, and are applicable to guiding government resource allocation policies to different US counties.","Li, Daniel; Gaynor, Sheila M; Quick, Corbin; Chen, Jarvis T; Stephenson, Briana J K; Coull, Brent A; Lin, Xihong",BMC Public Health,,383

No data exist on the effects of lockdowns on the health status of patients affected by chronic pathologies, specifically those with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Our study aims to establish variations across the psychological and cognitive profile of patients during the isolation period in Italy, in a cohort of patients affected by COPD, between February and May 2020. Forty patients with established COPD were comprehensively evaluated by geriatric multidimensional assessment before the spread of the epidemic in Italy, and submitted to a second evaluation during the subsequent lockdown. We assessed functional ability, basic and instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL and IADL), cognition and mood status. We compared the scores obtained at baseline against those obtained during the pandemic, and used mean differences for correlation with major clinical and functional indexes. The score differences from MMSE, ADL and IADL were statistically significant. Such differences were correlated to the presence of a caregiver and to the total number of family members living together. Remarkably, the loneliness dimension, more than the restrictions themselves, seemed to represent the major determinant of altered health status and depressed psycho-cognitive profile in our population. Also remarkably, we detected no correlation between the score variation and the respiratory function indexes of disease severity. The isolation measures adopted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have triggered the classic clinical string associated to geriatric isolation, which leads to a deterioration of cognitive functions, independence and frailty levels in a population affected by a chronic degenerative disease, such as COPD. If considered from a multidimensional geriatric point of view, the individual benefit of isolation measures could be small or non-existent.","Scarlata, Simone; Cardaci, Vittorio; Santangelo, Carmen; Matarese, Maria; Cesari, Matteo; Antonelli Incalzi, Raffaele",COPD,,383

The pandemic has represented a humanitarian crisis, since both the disease and the measures to contain it lead to persistent socioeconomic effects. In this context, the labor category has an important role, either because of the feasibility of maintaining the social distancing and living conditions allowed by the employment relationship, or because of the impossibility of adopting protection strategies due to job insecurity. The essay was initially built on the basis of a literature review on the interface between COVID-19 and workers' health, carried out from December 2019 to April 2020, on the PubMed, BIREME, Cochrane Library, medRxiv and LitCovid bases, as well as using gray literature. Health professionals are more affected, but they also have greater access to diagnosis; however, data are still scarce on other professional categories, as well as on the social determinants that lead to greater labor-related vulnerability. In Brazil, the pandemic coincides with a situation in which workers accumulate significant losses of labor and social security rights, in addition to pre-existing social inequalities, such as precarious housing, with greater exposure and risk. Although the pandemic is still evolving, social inequalities are expected to intensify, with the deep retraction of the economy, and workers must be a priority target of attention in the control and spread of the disease, in addition to being the axis for planning public social and health protection policies.","Santos, Kionna Oliveira Bernardes; Fernandes, Rita de Cássia Pereira; Almeida, Milena Maria Cordeiro de; Miranda, Samilly Silva; Mise, Yukari Figueroa; Lima, Monica Angelim Gomes de",Cad Saude Publica,,383

The potential of a live oral vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), however, remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the immunogenicity of live SARS-CoV-2 delivered to the gastrointestinal tract in rhesus macaques and its protective efficacy against intranasal and intratracheal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Post-pyloric administration of SARS-CoV-2 by esophagogastroduodenoscopy resulted in limited virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract and minimal to no induction of mucosal antibody titers in rectal swabs, nasal swabs, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Low levels of serum neutralizing antibodies were induced and correlated with modestly diminished viral loads in nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage following intranasal and intratracheal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Overall, our data show that post-pyloric inoculation of live SARS-CoV-2 is weakly immunogenic and confers partial protection against respiratory SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques. ImportanceSARS-CoV-2 remains a global threat, despite the rapid deployment but limited coverage of multiple vaccines. Alternative vaccine strategies that have favorable manufacturing timelines, greater ease of distribution and improved coverage may offer significant public health benefits, especially in resource-limited settings. Live oral vaccines have the potential to address some of these limitations; however no studies have yet been conducted to assess the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a live oral vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Here we report that oral administration of live SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates may offer prophylactic benefits, but that formulation and route of administration will require further optimization.","Yu, Jingyou; Collins, Natalie; Mercado, Noe Bladimir; McMahan, Katherine; Chandrashekar, Abishek; Liu, Jinyan; Anioke, Tochi; Chang, Aiquan; Giffin, Victoria; Hope, David; Sellers, Daniel; Nampanya, Felix; Gardner, Sarah; Barrett, Julia; Wan, Huahua; Velasco, Jason; Teow, Elyse; Cook, Anthony; Ry, Alex Van; Pessaint, Laurent; Andersen, Hanne; Lewis, Mark; Hofer, Christian; Burke, Donald S.; Barkei, Erica; King, Hannah; Subra, Caroline; Bolton, Diane L; Modjarrad, Kayvon; Michael, Nelson; Barouch, Dan H.",,,383

In Italy, some Regions opted for extensive testing, whereas others limited tests to selected subjects. To assess the influence of different strategies, we examined the incidence of death and severe cases in Italy. METHODS: Data on new cases of SARS-CoV-2, number of tests, deaths, and admissions to Intensive Care Units (ICU) were retrieved in each Italian Region, from February 24th to March 18th , 2020. As an index of different screening strategies, the number of tests/positive test results (P/T) ratio as of March 7th , 2020, was considered. The cumulative number of deaths and of new severe cases, between March 23th and 25th was recorded. The association of those two outcomes with the number of P/T ratio was assessed using linear regression models. RESULTS: In the interval between March 23th -25th , recorded deaths (*million inhabitants) were 14(3-54), whereas severe cases were 31(10-112). Both the number of deaths and that of severe cases showed a significant correlation (R2 .57 and .41, with p<.01) with the P/T ratio. Deaths and severe cases were associated with higher mean personal income and lower density of General Practioners (GPs). The association of P/T with severe cases and deaths retained statistical significance after adjusting for mean personal income (R2 .30 and .41, respectively; both p=.04) and GPs density (R2 .21 and .19, respectively; both p=.03).

On the basis of this issue, neurologists are very concerned about patients with neurological disorders, especially multiple sclerosis (MS), as consumers of immunosuppressive or immune-modulating drugs. Therefore, the administration of proper disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in MS patients is critical during the pandemic status. On the one hand, both the autoimmune diseases and immunosuppressive drugs increase the risk of infection due to impairment in the immune system, and on the other hand, postponing of MS treatment has serious consequences on the central nervous system. In the present study, we discussed recent literature about the effect of DMTs administration on the severity of COVID-19 in the MS patients. Overall, it seems that DMTs do not provoke the COVID-19 infection in the MS patients by declining immune responses and cytokine storm.

Macaques had clinical signs of viral infection, mild to moderate pneumonitis and extra-pulmonary pathologies, and both age groups recovered in two weeks. Baboons had prolonged viral RNA shedding and substantially more lung inflammation compared with macaques. Inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage was increased in old versus young baboons. Using techniques including computed tomography imaging, immunophenotyping, and alveolar/peripheral cytokine response and immunohistochemical analyses, we delineated cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaque and baboon lungs, including innate and adaptive immune cells and a prominent type-I interferon response. Macaques developed T-cell memory phenotypes/responses and bystander cytokine production. Old macaques had lower titres of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody levels compared with young macaques. Acute respiratory distress in macaques and baboons recapitulates the progression of COVID-19 in humans, making them suitable as models to test vaccines and therapies.","Singh, Dhiraj Kumar; Singh, Bindu; Ganatra, Shashank R; Gazi, Michal; Cole, Journey; Thippeshappa, Rajesh; Alfson, Kendra J; Clemmons, Elizabeth; Gonzalez, Olga; Escobedo, Ruby; Lee, Tae-Hyung; Chatterjee, Ayan; Goez-Gazi, Yenny; Sharan, Riti; Gough, Maya; Alvarez, Cynthia; Blakley, Alyssa; Ferdin, Justin; Bartley, Carmen; Staples, Hilary; Parodi, Laura; Callery, Jessica; Mannino, Amanda; Klaffke, Benjamin; Escareno, Priscilla; Platt, Roy N; Hodara, Vida; Scordo, Julia; Gautam, Shalini; Vilanova, Andreu G; Olmo-Fontanez, Angelica; Schami, Alyssa; Oyejide, Adelekan; Ajithdoss, Dharani K; Copin, Richard; Baum, Alina; Kyratsous, Christos; Alvarez, Xavier; Ahmed, Mushtaq; Rosa, Bruce; Goodroe, Anna; Dutton, John; Hall-Ursone, Shannan; Frost, Patrice A; Voges, Andra K; Ross, Corinna N; Sayers, Ken; Chen, Christopher; Hallam, Cory; Khader, Shabaana A",Nat Microbiol,,383

This short communication has attempted to simplify the available information on the subject in a manner that is easy to understand and implement in clinical setting. COVID 19 is not a single disease but a spectrum and should be classified based on clinical, radiological and laboratory parameters. A simple yet powerful way is to classify COVID 19 as COVIN - COVID Infection but no disease; COVIRI - COVID infection with predominant respiratory symptoms; COVIDI - COVID infection leading to an abnormal immune response and COVID S- referring to the sequalae of an acute COVID Infection. A clinical subtype specific approach may result in easier communication between healthcare providers which in turn may improve patient outcomes by providing targeted therapy.","Bagaria, Vaibhav; Vaishya, Raju",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,383
511704,Reduced Admissions for Cerebrovascular Events During COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy,2020,"INTRODUCTION: To analyze COVID-19 mortality in cancer patients and associated factors such as age, sex, type of insurance, situation at COVID-19 diagnosis, and cancer histology during the pandemic at a cancer center in Brazil. METHODS: Cross-sectional study carried out from April 02, 2020 to August 31, 2020 at A.C. Camargo Cancer Center (ACCCC), in São Paulo, Brazil. Cases were extracted from the Hospital Cancer Registry. COVID-19 lethality rates by histology were calculated; multiple logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with COVID-19 mortality. The log-rank test was applied to compare the survival curves for each variable. RESULTS: Of the 411 patients analyzed, 51 (12.4%) died due to COVID-19. Death occurred at an average age of 63 years. The fatality rate was higher for lung (0.333) and hematological (0.213) cancers and was associated with age over 60 years. The greatest chances of death from COVID-19 were in cases of lung (odds ratio, OR, 4.05, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.33-12.34) and hematological (OR 2.17, 95% CI 0.96-4.90) cancers, and in patients currently undergoing cancer treatment (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.25-6.13). There were no statistical differences in survival by sex, age group, type of insurance, situation at the diagnosis of COVID-19, and histology of cancer for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality due to COVID-19 in cancer patients is heterogeneous. These findings reinforce the need for individualized strategies for the management of different types of cancer that reduce the risk of death from COVID-19.","Fernandes, Gisele Aparecida; Feriani, Diego; França E Silva, Ivan Leonardo Avelino; Mendonça E Silva, Diego Rodrigues; Arantes, Paola Engelmann; Canteras, Juliana da Silva; da Silva, Rodrigo Reghini; Curado, Maria Paula",Semin. oncol,,383
511705,Reduced Admissions for Cerebrovascular Events During COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy,2020,"Information processing in the brain is mediated by structural white matter pathways and is highly dependent on topological brain properties. Here we combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), specifically looking at macroscale connectivity to understand whether regional, network-level or whole-brain structural properties are more responsible for stimulus propagation. Neuronavigated TMS pulses were delivered over two individually defined nodes of the default mode (DMN) and dorsal attention (DAN) networks in a group of healthy subjects, with test-retest reliability assessed 1-month apart. TMS-evoked activity was predicted by the modularity and structural integrity of the stimulated network rather than the targeted region(s) or the whole-brain connectivity, suggesting network-level structural connectivity as more relevant than local brain properties in shaping TMS signal propagation. The importance of network structural connectome was unveiled only by evoked activity, but not resting-state data. Future clinicals interventions might enhance target engagement by adopting DWI-guided, network-focused TMS.","Momi, Davide; Ozdemir, Recep A; Tadayon, Ehsan; Boucher, Pierre; Shafi, Mouhsin M; Pascual-Leone, Alvaro; Santarnecchi, Emiliano",Neuroimage,,383

There is a great demand for novel chemical agents that are capable of killing specific pathogens or augmenting the efficiency of existing disinfectants. Herein, we report the synthesis and comprehensive characterization (through FT-IR, HR-MS, SEM, TGA-DSC, CV, UV and SCXRD analyses) of six novel copper(ii) complexes, [CuL(4X-An)] (5a-5d), [CuL(An)] (5e), and [CuL(benzhydrylamine)] (5f), and their evaluation as anti-microbial agents against WHO priority pathogens, confirming their possible use in hospital settings. The compounds were synthesized with a Schiff base (H2L) obtained by the condensation reaction of 3-acetyl-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2,4(3H)-dione (DHA) and benzohydrazide and further addition of different p-substituted aniline (An) molecules. Single crystal structure analyses revealed that the aniline derivatives are isostructural to the copper atom in a square planar coordination, while the benzhydrylamine complex forms a dimer (5f), with a square pyramidal coordination geometry for the metal. Time-kill kinetics and reduced microbial recovery studies revealed excellent bactericidal action against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Particularly, the novel compound 5f significantly reduced microbial recovery compared to ethanol-based sanitisers. In fact, addition of 5f to 70% ethanol remarkably synergized the killing with >6-log reduction in microbial burden. Overall, our novel compounds would increase the disinfection efficacy in hospitals and industries, thereby improving the efficiency and minimizing the risk of infections.","Kushwaha, Namrata; Negi, Sheetal; Kumar, Ajay; Zangrando, Ennio; Kataria, Ramesh; Saini, Vikram",Dalton trans (2003.

514812,Lack of dyspnea in patients with Covid-19: another neurological conundrum?,2020,"This article describes the history and evolution of pharmacist-physician collaborative practice agreements (CPAs) in the United States with future directions to support pharmacists' provider status as the profession continues to evolve from product-oriented to patient-centered care and population health. The pharmacy profession has a long history of dispensing and compounding, with the addition of clinical roles in the late 20th century. These clinical roles have continued to expand into diverse arenas such as communicable and non-communicable diseases, antimicrobial stewardship, emergency preparedness and response, public health education and health promotion, and critical and emergency care. Pharmacists continue to serve as integral members of interprofessional and interdisciplinary healthcare teams. In this context, CPAs allow pharmacists to expand their roles in patient care and may be considered as a step towards securing provider status. Moving beyond CPAs to a provider status would enable pharmacists to be reimbursed for cognitive services and promote integrated public health delivery models.","Cernasev, Alina; Aruru, Meghana; Clark, Suzanne; Patel, Komal; DiPietro Mager, Natalie; Subramaniam, Vaiyapuri; Truong, Hoai-An",,,383
515070,Acral Changes in pediatric patients during COVID 19 pandemic: Registry report from the COVID 19 response task force of the society of pediatric dermatology (SPD) and pediatric dermatology research alliance (PeDRA),2021,"The transport and deposition of micrometer-sized particles in the lung is the primary mechanism for the spread of aerosol borne diseases such as corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19). Considering the current situation, modeling the transport and deposition of drops in human lung bronchioles is of utmost importance to determine their consequences on human health. The current study reports experimental observations on deposition in micro-capillaries, representing distal lung bronchioles, over a wide range of Re that imitates the particle dynamics in the entire lung. The experiment investigated deposition in tubes of diameter ranging from 0.3 mm to 2 mm and over a wide range of Reynolds number (10-2 â©½ Re â©½ 103). The range of the tube diameter and Re used in this study is motivated by the dimensions of lung airways and typical breathing flow rates. The aerosol fluid was loaded with boron doped carbon quantum dots as fluorophores. An aerosol plume was generated from this mixture fluid using an ultrasonic nebulizer, producing droplets with 6.5 µm as a mean diameter and over a narrow distribution of sizes. The amount of aerosol deposited on the tube walls was measured using a spectrofluorometer. The experimental results show that dimensionless deposition (Î´) varies inversely with the bronchiole aspect ratio ( L ¯ ), with the effect of the Reynolds number (Re) being significant only at low L ¯ . Î´ also increased with increasing dimensionless bronchiole diameter ( D ¯ ), but it is invariant with the particle size based Reynolds number. We show that Î´ L ¯ â¼ R e - 2 for 10-2 â©½ Re â©½ 1, which is typical of a diffusion dominated regime. For Re â©¾ 1, in the impaction dominated regime, Î´ L ¯ is shown to be independent of Re. We also show a crossover regime where sedimentation becomes important. The experimental results conclude that lower breathing frequency and higher breath hold time could significantly increase the chances of getting infected with COVID-19 in crowded places.","Mallik, Arnab Kumar; Mukherjee, Soumalya; Panchagnula, Mahesh V",Phys Fluids (1994),,383

Therefore, this study aimed to identify the 500 most cited physical activity publications and report their bibliometric characteristics. METHODS: The Web of Science database (all database indexes) was searched, and bibliometric characteristics were imported and calculated. RESULTS: A total of 520 publications were ranked as the top 500. The sum of the citations was 326,258, and the average citation density was 41.0 (45.1) citations per year. Original research articles constituted the major portion of included publications (53.7%; 170,774 citations). Papers reporting relationship of physical activity with health were the most prevalent type of publication included (43.7%; 141,027 citations). Journal impact factor had a weak but significant positive correlation with citation density (r = .12; P = .006). The United States was ranked first in terms of the contributions from institutions and authors contributing to the most cited physical activity papers.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study whether the hemostatic status in ACLF is merely an exaggeration from the status in patients with compensated and acutely decompensated cirrhosis, or whether sepsis-associated hemostatic changes contribute. METHODS: We performed extensive hemostatic profiling in 31 adult patients with ACLF, 20 patients with sepsis without underlying CLD, and 40 healthy controls. RESULTS: We found similarly elevated plasma levels of the platelet adhesive protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) and decreased levels of the VWF-regulating protease ADAMTS13 in both groups compared to healthy controls. In vivo markers of activation of coagulation (TAT, D-dimer) were similarly elevated in both groups compared to controls, but ex vivo thrombin generating capacity was similar between patients and controls, despite a much more profound INR elevation in ACLF. Plasma fibrinogen levels were much higher in septics, which was accompanied by a decreased ex vivo clot permeability and an increased in ex vivo resistance to clot lysis. All hemostatic parameters were remarkably stable over the first 10 days after admission. CONCLUSIONS: We have found hemostatic changes in ACLF to partially overlap with that of patients with sepsis, and evidence of preserved hemostatic capacity in both patient groups. The notable difference was a profound hyperfibrinogenemia, associated with a thrombogenic clot structure and a marked ex-vivo resistance to fibrinolysis in patients with sepsis.","Lisman, Ton; Arefaine, Bethlehem; Adelmeijer, Jelle; Zamalloa, Ane; Corcoran, Eleanor; Smith, John G; Bernal, William; Patel, Vishal C",J. thromb. haemost,,383

Because of the complexity and particularity of their structure, it becomes difficult to model the penetration and flow characteristics of liquid in nonwoven fiber materials. In this paper, a novel seepage time soft sensor model of nonwoven fabric, based on Monte Carlo (MC), integrating extreme learning machine (ELM) (MCELM) is proposed. The Monte Carlo method is used to expand data samples. Then, an ELM method is used to establish the prediction model of the dyeing time of the nonwoven fiber material overlaps with the porous medium, as well as the insertion degree and height of the different quantity of hides. Compared with the back propagation (BP) neural network and radial basis function (RBF) neural network, the results show that the prediction model based on the MCELM method has significant power in terms of accuracy and prediction speed, which is conducive to the precise and rapid manufacture of nonwoven fiber materials in practical applications between liquid seepage characteristics and structural characteristics of porous media. Furthermore, the relationship between the proposed models has certain value for predicting the behavior and use of nonwoven fiber materials with different structural characteristics and related research processes.","Zhang, Jing; Fan, Yiqiang; Zhang, Lulu; Xu, Chi; Dong, Xiaobin; Liu, Luyao; Zhang, Zhongping; Qiu, Xianbo",Sensors (Basel),,383

As of April 3, 2020, more than 1,000,000 human infections have been diagnosed around the world, which exhibited apparent person-to-person transmission characteristics of this virus. The capacity of vertical transmission in SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial recently. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is now confirmed as the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and plays essential roles in human infection and transmission. In present study, we collected the online available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to evaluate the cell specific expression of ACE2 in maternal-fetal interface as well as in multiple fetal organs. Our results revealed that ACE2 was highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta. Meanwhile, ACE2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart, liver and lung, but not in kidney. And in a study containing series fetal and post-natal mouse lung, we observed ACE2 was dynamically changed over the time, and ACE2 was extremely high in neonatal mice at post-natal day 1~3. In summary, this study revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor was widely spread in specific cell types of maternal-fetal interface and fetal organs.

Coronavirus had not yet been successfully cultured from tears or conjunctival swabs in humans, neither SARS-CoV-2 nor SARS-CoV. However, live feline coronavirus has been isolated from conjunctival swabs. In addition, infection of COVID-19 through unprotected eye exposure had been suspected in several articles. Reports of ophthalmologists and otolaryngologists died of COVID-19 also raised concern on ocular transmission. As a result, we strongly suggest that personal protective equipment (PPE) should cover the mouth, nose, and eyes of ophthalmologists, especially when conjunctivitis caused by SARS-CoV-2 is clinically indistinguishable from other viral follicular conjunctivitis.","Chen, Meng-Jou; Chang, Kao-Jung; Hsu, Chih-Chien; Lin, Pei-Yu; Jui-Ling Liu, Catherine",J Chin Med Assoc,,383
518013,Does COVID-19 pneumonia signify secondary organizing pneumonia?: A narrative review comparing the similarities between these two distinct entities,2021,"Objectives: During public health emergencies, people often scramble to buy scarce goods, which may lead to panic behavior and cause serious negative impacts on public health management. Due to the absence of relevant research, the internal logic of this phenomenon is not clear. This study explored whether and why public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic stimulate consumers' preference for scarce products. Methods: Applying the questionnaire survey method, two online surveys were conducted on the Credamo data platform in China. The first survey was launched in February and collected psychological and behavioral data from 1,548 participants. Considering the likelihood of population relocation due to the pandemic, a follow-up survey was conducted in August with 463 participants who had participated in the first survey and had not relocated to other cities between February and August. The hypotheses were tested with these data through stepwise regression analysis, bootstrapping, and robustness testing. Results: Pandemic severity was found to positively affect scarce consumption behavior and the effect was found to be situational; this indicates that the impact of the pandemic on scarce consumption was only significant during the pandemic. Further, it was found that materialism plays a mediating role in the relationship between pandemic severity and scarce consumption. Finally, the need to belong was found to play a moderating role between pandemic severity and materialism. Conclusion: This study findings imply that the scarce consumption behavior during public health emergencies can be reduced by decreasing materialism and increasing the need to belong. These findings may aid government leaders in managing public health emergencies.","Jin, Xiaotong; Li, Jianan; Song, Wei; Zhao, Taiyang",Front Public Health,,383

518462,High Infection Fatality Rate Among Elderly and Risk Factors Associated With Infection Fatality Rate and Asymptomatic Infections of COVID-19 Cases in Hong Kong,2021,"BACKGROUND: The current pandemic of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, widely known as COVID-19, has affected millions of people around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended vigorous testing to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from other respiratory infections to aid in guiding appropriate care and management. Situations like this have demanded robust testing strategies and pooled testing of samples for SARS-CoV-2 virus has provided the solution to mass screening of people for COVID-19. A pooled testing strategy can be very effective in testing when resources are limited, yet it comes with its own limitations. These benefits and limitations need critical consideration when it comes to testing highly infectious diseases like COVID-19. METHODS: This study evaluated the pooled testing of nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-COV-2 by comparing the sensitivity of individual sample testing with 4-and 8-pool sample testing. Median cycle threshold (Ct) values were compared, and the precision of pooled testing was assessed through an inter- and intra-assay of pooled samples. Coefficient of variance was calculated for inter- and intra-assay variability. RESULTS: The sensitivity becomes considerably lower when the samples are pooled. There is a high percentage of false negative reports with larger sample pool size and when the patient viral load is low or weak positive samples. High variability was seen in the intra- and inter-assay, especially among weak positive samples and when more number of samples are pooled together. CONCLUSION: As COVID - 19 infection numbers and need for testing remain high, we must meticulously evaluate the testing strategy for each country depending on its testing capacity, infrastructure, economic strength, and need to determine the optimal balance on the cost-effective strategy of resource saving and risk/ cost of missing positive patients.","Mahmoud, Sally A; Ibrahim, Esra; Thakre, Bhagyashree; Teddy, Juliet G; Raheja, Preety; Ganesan, Subhashini; Zaher, Walid A",BMC Infect Dis,,383

518751,Remote Cardiac Rehabilitation is a Good Alternative of Outpatient Cardiac Rehabilitation in the Covid-19 Era,2020,"BACKGROUND: It remains unclear whether COVID-19 is associated with psychiatric symptoms during or after the acute illness phase. Being affected by the disease exposes the individual to an uncertain prognosis and a state of quarantine. These factors can predispose individuals to the development of mental symptoms during or after the acute phase of the disease. There is a need for prospective studies assessing psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 patients in the post-infection period. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 tests were collected at patients' homes under the supervision of trained healthcare personnel. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were classified as mild cases (N = 895) at treatment intake were further assessed for the presence of psychiatric symptoms (on average, 56.6 days after the intake). We investigated the association between the number of COVID-19 symptoms at intake and depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms approximately two months later, adjusting for previous mental health status, time between baseline and outcome, and other confounders. Multivariate logistic regression and generalized linear models were employed for categorical and continuous outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: A clinically significant level of depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms were reported by 26.2% (N = 235), 22.4% (N = 201), and 17.3% (N = 155) of the sample. Reporting an increased number of COVID-related symptoms was associated with the presence of clinically significant levels of depressive (aOR = 1.059;95%CI = 1.002-1.119), anxiety (aOR = 1.072;95%CI = 1.012-1.134), and post-traumatic stress (aOR = 1.092;95%CI = 1.024-1.166) symptoms. Sensitivity analyses supported findings for both continuous and categorical measures. CONCLUSION: Exposure to an increased number of COVID-19 symptoms may be associated with depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms after the acute phase of the disease. These patients should be monitored for the development of psychiatric symptoms after COVID-19 treatment discharge. Early interventions, such as brief interventions of psychoeducation on coping strategies, could benefit these individuals.","Ismael, Flavia; Bizario, João C S; Battagin, Tatiane; Zaramella, Beatriz; Leal, Fabio E; Torales, Julio; Ventriglio, Antonio; Marziali, Megan E; Martins, Silvia S; Castaldelli-Maia, João M",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,383
518777,"Codes, Coding, and COVID-19",2020,"The ongoing pandemic spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) demands skillful strategies for novel drug development, drug repurposing and cotreatments, in particular focusing on existing candidates of host-directed antivirals (HDAs). The developmental drug IMU-838, currently being investigated in a phase 2b trial in patients suffering from autoimmune diseases, represents an inhibitor of human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) with a recently proven antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. Here, we established an analysis system for assessing the antiviral potency of IMU-838 and DHODH-directed back-up drugs in cultured cell-based infection models. By the use of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunofluorescence, Western blot, in-cell ELISA, viral yield reduction and RT-qPCR methods, we demonstrated the following: (i) IMU-838 and back-ups show anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity at several levels of viral replication, i.e., protein production, double-strand RNA synthesis, and release of infectious virus; (ii) antiviral efficacy in Vero cells was demonstrated in a micromolar range (IMU-838 half-maximal effective concentration, EC50, of 7.6 ± 5.8 µM); (iii) anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity was distinct from cytotoxic effects (half-cytotoxic concentration, CC50, >100 µM); (iv) the drug in vitro potency was confirmed using several Vero lineages and human cells; (v) combination with remdesivir showed enhanced anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity; (vi) vidofludimus, the active determinant of IMU-838, exerted a broad-spectrum activity against a selection of major human pathogenic viruses. These findings strongly suggest that developmental DHODH inhibitors represent promising candidates for use as anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.","Hahn, Friedrich; Wangen, Christina; Häge, Sigrun; Peter, Antonia Sophia; Dobler, Gerhard; Hurst, Brett; Julander, Justin; Fuchs, Jonas; Ruzsics, Zsolt; Überla, Klaus; Jäck, Hans-Martin; Ptak, Roger; Muehler, Andreas; Gröppel, Manfred; Vitt, Daniel; Peelen, Evelyn; Kohlhof, Hella; Marschall, Manfred",Viruses,,383

METHODS: To this end, a population-based study, in the province of Udine (466,700 inhabitants, with age > 15 years old, Friuli Venezia Giulia region, Italy) was planned. The primary outcome was the prevalence of COVID-19 in the first two months of the outbreak. All the rheumatic patients treated with biologic agents or small molecules in the last 6 months in our province were included (N=1051). RESULTS: From February 29 to April 25, 2020, 4 adult patients (4/1051, i.e. 3.8/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.5-9.7/1000) were registered as swab test positive by PCR for COVID-19. Overall, a total of 47/1051 (4,5%) cases were tested for COVID-19 by PCR in the same period, and 15 of them due to symptoms compatible with COVID-19. In the general population, the prevalence was 937 cases/466700 (2/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.9-2.1/1000, p value=0.33, chi square test), and 20,179/466,700 (4.3%) swab tests for COVID-19 were performed.. CONCLUSION: The risk of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients under biologic agents or small molecules does not appear different from that observed in the general population. Patients should be informed to safely proceed with their treatment and follow the rules for self-protection to COVID-19.","Quartuccio, Luca; Valent, Francesca; Pasut, Enrico; Tascini, Carlo; Vita, Salvatore De",,,383

Little is currently known about the surgical practices in orthopaedic emergencies in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak (1). This is a retrospective case series of 10 orthopaedic trauma patients who underwent fracture fixation in March 2020. Of the 10 patients testing COVID-19 positive, there were a total of 16 long bone fractures, 5 pelvic ring fractures, and 1 lumbar burst fracture. There were 7 (70%) males in this cohort. Two (20%) of the COVID-positive patients did not develop fever, leukocytosis, respiratory insufficiency, or positive imaging findings and were younger (average age 25.5 years) with fewer comorbidities (average 0.5) compared with the 8 symptomatic COVID-19-positive patients (56.6 years with 1.88 comorbidities). Advancement of COVID-19 pathogenesis with lung opacities and prolonged intubation occurred in all 5 patients who remained on ventilation postoperatively (range 9 hours-11 days).

520356,Clinical and morphological parallels of lung and kidney damage in COVID-19,2020,The objectives of this study were to profile the landscape of women's alcohol use programs in Canada. We explored service users' and providers' beliefs about alcohol use problems and how this affected treatment choices for alcohol use problems. Data were collected through standardized measures alongside in-depth semi-structured narrative interviews in six women's alcohol treatment sites in Canada. Findings demonstrated that service users and service providers often supported an abstinence choice and were ambivalent about the viability of controlled or managed use in both abstinence- and harm reduction-based programs. Findings showed that women service users in this study had significant rates of trauma and depression which were associated with their alcohol use; the majority still adopted dominant alcohol addiction discourse which emphasizes the need for abstinence.

We aim to describe our experience providing acute stroke care at a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) and the impact of the pandemic on the quality of care for patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from a quality improvement registry of consecutive AIS patients at New York University Langone Health's CSC between 06/01/2019-05/15/2020. During the early stages of the pandemic, the acute stroke process was modified to incorporate COVID-19 screening, testing, and other precautionary measures. We compared stroke quality metrics including treatment times and discharge outcomes of AIS patients during the pandemic (03/012020-05/152020) compared with a historical pre-pandemic group (6/1/2019-2/29/2020). RESULTS: A total of 754 patients (pandemic-120; pre-pandemic-634) were admitted with a principal diagnosis of AIS; 198 (26.3%) received alteplase and/or mechanical thrombectomy. Despite longer median door to head CT times (16 vs 12 minutes; p = 0.05) and a trend towards longer door to groin puncture times (79.5 vs. 71 min, pâ¯=â¯0.06), the time to alteplase administration (36 vs 35 min; pâ¯=â¯0.83), door to reperfusion times (103 vs 97 min, pâ¯=â¯0.18) and defect-free care (95.2% vs 94.7%; pâ¯=â¯0.84) were similar in the pandemic and pre-pandemic groups. Successful recanalization rates (TICI&#8805;2b) were also similar (82.6% vs. 86.7%, pâ¯=â¯0.48). After adjusting for stroke severity, age and a prior history of transient ischemic attack/stroke, pandemic patients had increased discharge mortality (adjusted OR 2.90 95% CI 1.77 - 7.17, pâ¯=â¯0.021) CONCLUSION: Despite unprecedented demands on emergency healthcare services, early multidisciplinary efforts to adapt the acute stroke treatment process resulted in keeping the stroke quality time metrics close to pre-pandemic levels. Future studies will be needed with a larger cohort comparing discharge and long-term outcomes between pre-pandemic and pandemic AIS patients.","Agarwal, Shashank; Scher, Erica; Rossan-Raghunath, Nirmala; Marolia, Dilshad; Butnar, Mariya; Torres, Jose; Zhang, Cen; Kim, Sun; Sanger, Matthew; Humbert, Kelley; Tanweer, Omar; Shapiro, Maksim; Raz, Eytan; Nossek, Erez; Nelson, Peter K; Riina, Howard A; de Havenon, Adam; Wachs, Michael; Farkas, Jeffrey; Tiwari, Ambooj; Arcot, Karthikeyan; Parella, David Turkel; Liff, Jeremy; Wu, Tina; Wittman, Ian; Caldwell, Reed; Frontera, Jennifer; Lord, Aaron; Ishida, Koto; Yaghi, Shadi",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,383

Objective: To examine outcomes and risk factors associated with COVID-19 clinical severity in a large, diverse cohort of North American patients with MS. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analysis used deidentified, cross-sectional data on patients with MS and SARS-CoV-2 infection reported by health care professionals in North American academic and community practices between April 1, 2020, and December 12, 2020, in the COVID-19 Infections in MS Registry. Health care professionals were asked to report patients after a minimum of 7 days from initial symptom onset and after sufficient time had passed to observe the COVID-19 disease course through resolution of acute illness or death. Data collection began April 1, 2020, and is ongoing. Exposures: Laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection or highly suspected COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical outcome with 4 levels of increasing severity: not hospitalized, hospitalization only, admission to the intensive care unit and/or required ventilator support, and death. Results: Of 1626 patients, most had laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection (1345 [82.7%]), were female (1202 [74.0%]), and had relapsing-remitting MS (1255 [80.4%]). A total of 996 patients (61.5%) were non-Hispanic White, 337 (20.8%) were Black, and 190 (11.7%) were Hispanic/Latinx. The mean (SD) age was 47.7 (13.2) years, and 797 (49.5%) had 1 or more comorbidity. The overall mortality rate was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.5%-4.3%). Ambulatory disability and older age were each independently associated with increased odds of all clinical severity levels compared with those not hospitalized after adjusting for other risk factors (nonambulatory: hospitalization only, odds ratio [OR], 2.8 [95% CI, 1.6-4.8]; intensive care unit/required ventilator support, OR, 3.5 [95% CI, 1.6-7.8]; death, OR, 25.4 [95% CI, 9.3-69.1]; age [every 10 years]: hospitalization only, OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.6]; intensive care unit/required ventilator support, OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 0.99-1.7]; death, OR, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.2-2.6]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this registry-based cross-sectional study, increased disability was independently associated with worse clinical severity including death from COVID-19. Other risk factors for worse outcomes included older age, Black race, cardiovascular comorbidities, and recent treatment with corticosteroids. Knowledge of these risk factors may improve the treatment of patients with MS and COVID-19 by helping clinicians identify patients requiring more intense monitoring or COVID-19 treatment.","Salter, Amber; Fox, Robert J; Newsome, Scott D; Halper, June; Li, David K B; Kanellis, Pamela; Costello, Kathleen; Bebo, Bruce; Rammohan, Kottil; Cutter, Gary R; Cross, Anne H",JAMA neurol.

People who have social contacts with COVID-19 patients might be at higher risk of physical or mental health problems. This study investigated whether people who had social contacts with COVID-19 patients would have poorer physical or mental outcomes, and different attitudes and behaviors. Chinese adults were recruited to fill in an online survey using snowball sampling during 21st-26nd February 2020. Physical symptoms, psychological outcomes, quality of life, COVID-19 related attitudes, and behaviors were measured. The differences in the outcomes between participants who had COVID-19 social contacts and those who had not were analyzed. The survey included 1,447 non-infected eligible participants. Among those, 173 (12.0%) reported at least one confirmed/suspected case in their social contacts. In the multiple regression adjusted for demographic data, the presence of confirmed/suspected infection cases in one's social contacts was significantly associated with poorer physical and mental outcomes, lower health-related quality of life, and different COVID-19 related attitudes and behaviors (p < 0.05). In conclusion, people who had social contacts with COVID-19 patients were at risk of adverse health outcomes. Future studies are needed to understand the long-term impacts.

590674,Management of COVID-19 in a Deployed Setting: Corrigendum,2021-07-10,"BACKGROUND: We launched a retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 192 patients with COVID-19, aiming to depict the kinetic profile of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and explore the factors related to SARS-CoV-2 antibody expression. METHODS: Data on 192 confirmed patients with COVID-19 between January and February 2020 was collected from the designated hospital that received patients with COVID-19 in Guangzhou, China. Moreover, a cohort of 130 suspected patients with COVID-19 and 209 healthy people were also enrolled in this study. IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected by the chemiluminescence immunoassay kits in different groups. RESULTS: A total of 192 COVID-19 cases were analyzed, of which had 81.8% anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM detected and 93.2% anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG detected, respectively, at the time of sampling. The kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG showed that, the confirmed cases had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM seroconversion occurred 5–10 days after the onset of the symptoms, and then IgM rose rapidly to reach a peak within around 2–3 weeks, maintaining at its peak for 1 week before its decline. While they had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion simultaneously or sequentially with IgM, reaching its peak within around 3 to 4 weeks and began to decline after the fifth week. Besides, correlation analysis showed that in patients with COVID-19 the level of IgM was related to gender and disease severity (P < 0.01), and the level of IgG was related to age and disease severity (P < 0.001). The univariate analysis of relevant factors indicated that the level of IgG had a weak correlation with age (r = 0.374, P < 0.01). The level of IgM in male patients was higher than that in female patients (P < 0.001). The expression level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were positively correlated with the severity of COVID-19 and the duration of the virus in the patients. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study show that anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG can be important assisting COVID-19 diagnosis, especially in the early phase of infection. Furthermore, antibody expression in patients with COVID-19 is also correlated with disease severity, age, gender, and virus clearance or continuous replication.","Ou, Jingyi; Tan, Mingkai; He, Haolan; Tan, Haiyan; Mai, Jiewen; Long, Yaoxiang; Jiang, Xiaowen; He, Qing; Huang, Ying; Li, Yan; Chen, Renshen; Li, Liya; Shi, Yaling; Li, Fang",J Appl Lab Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/jalm/jfab003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34329427/,383

The relationship between housing, behavior, brain health, and mental wellbeing in humans remains poorly understood. We therefore explored the interaction of housing quality, weekend/holiday sedentary behavior, brain structure, and anxiety in healthy Japanese adults. Whole-brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods based on gray matter volume and fractional anisotropy were used as markers for brain health. Correlation tests were conducted, and then adjusted for multiple comparisons using the False Discovery Rate method. Housing quality and weekend/holiday sedentary behavior were associated with fractional anisotropy, but not with gray matter volume. Fractional anisotropy showed significant associations with anxiety. Lastly, both weekend/holiday sedentary behavior and housing quality were indirectly associated with anxiety through fractional anisotropy. These results add to the limited evidence surrounding the relationship among housing, behavior, and the brain. Furthermore, these results show that behavior and housing qualities can have an indirect impact on anxiety through neurobiological markers such as fractional anisotropy.","Pineda, Juan Cesar D.; Kokubun, Keisuke; Ikaga, Toshiharu; Yamakawa, Yoshinori",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91363-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34099762/,383
591344,97P Is continuing CDK4-6 inhibitor therapy safe during the COVID-19 pandemic? A UK cancer centre experience,2021-05-31,"MOTIVATION: There is a need for rapid and easy-to-use, alignment-free methods to cluster large groups of protein sequence data. Commonly used phylogenetic trees based on alignments can be used to visualize only a limited number of protein sequences. DGraph, introduced here, is an application developed to generate 2-dimensional (2D) maps based on similarity scores for sequences. The program automatically calculates and graphically displays property distance (PD) scores based on physico-chemical property (PCP) similarities from an unaligned list of FASTA files. Such “PD-graphs” show the interrelatedness of the sequences, whereby clusters can reveal deeper connectivities. RESULTS: Property distance graphs generated for flavivirus (FV), enterovirus (EV), and coronavirus (CoV) sequences from complete polyproteins or individual proteins are consistent with biological data on vector types, hosts, cellular receptors, and disease phenotypes. Property distance graphs separate the tick- from the mosquito-borne FV, cluster viruses that infect bats, camels, seabirds, and humans separately. The clusters correlate with disease phenotype. The PD method segregates the β-CoV spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) sequences from other human pathogenic CoV, with clustering consistent with cellular receptor usage. The graphs also suggest evolutionary relationships that may be difficult to determine with conventional bootstrapping methods that require postulating an ancestral sequence.","Braun, Benjamin A; Schein, Catherine H; Braun, Werner",Bioinform Biol Insights,https://doi.org/10.1177/11779322211020316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34163149/,383

However, the United States’ coronavirus response faced data gaps, inadequate and inconsistent definitions of data across different governmental jurisdictions, ambiguous timing in reporting, problems in accessing data, and changing interpretations from scientific institutions. These present numerous problems for the decision makers relying on this information. This paper documents some of the data pitfalls in coronavirus public health data reporting, as identified by the authors in the course of supporting data management for New England’s coronavirus response. We provide recommendations for individuals to collect data more effectively during emergency situations such as a COVID-19 surge, as well as recommendations for institutions to provide more meaningful data for various users to access.

592491,Resumption of Respiratory Outpatient Services in the COVID-19 era: experience from Southern Italy,2020-07-02,"Significance: Opioid use disorder and transition to injection drug use (IDU) are an urgent, nationwide public health crisis. Wounds and skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are common complications of IDU that disproportionately affect people who inject drugs (PWID) and are a major source of morbidity and mortality for this population. Critical Issues: Injections in a nonsterile environment and reusing or sharing needles facilitates bacterial inoculation, with subsequent risk of serious complications such as sepsis, gangrene, amputation, and death. PWID are susceptible to infections with a wide spectrum of organisms beyond common culprits of SSTI, including Clostridium and Bacillus spp., as well as Candida. Recent Advances: Syringe services programs (SSPs) are cost-effective and successful in reducing harms associated with IDU. SSPs provide new equipment to PWID and aid in discarding used equipment. SSPs aim to reduce the risks of unhygienic injecting practices, which are associated with transmission of infections and blood-borne pathogens. Future Directions: Concurrently run SSPs and wound care clinics are uniquely positioned to facilitate care to PWID. Providing new, sterile equipment as well as early wound care intervention can reduce morbidity and mortality as well as health care expenditures by reducing the number of SSTI and injection-related wounds that require hospital admission. Establishment of wound care clinics as part of an SSP represents an untapped potential to reduce harm.","Sanchez, Daniela P.; Tookes, Hansel; Pastar, Irena; Lev-Tov, Hadar",Adv Wound Care (New Rochelle),https://doi.org/10.1089/wound.2020.1243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33913781/,383
592514,COVID-19 Financial Resources for Physicians,2020-04-28,"Zoonotic tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), a member of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) has increasingly gathered attention as a public health risk, particularly in developing countries with higher disease prevalence. M. bovis is capable of infecting multiple hosts encompassing a number of domestic animals, in particular cattle as well as a broad range of wildlife reservoirs. Humans are the incidental hosts of M. bovis whereby its transmission to humans is primarily through the consumption of cattle products such as unpasteurized milk or raw meat products that have been contaminated with M. bovis or the transmission could be due to close contact with infected cattle. Also, the transmission could occur through aerosol inhalation of infective droplets or infected body fluids or tissues in the presence of wound from infected animals. The zoonotic risk of M. bovis in humans exemplified by miscellaneous studies across different countries suggested the risk of occupational exposure towards M. bovis infection, especially those animal handlers that have close and unreserved contact with cattle and wildlife populations These animal handlers comprising of livestock farmers, abattoir workers, veterinarians and their assistants, hunters, wildlife workers as well as other animal handlers are at different risk of contracting M. bovis infection, depending on the nature of their jobs and how close is their interaction with infected animals. It is crucial to identify the underlying transmission risk factors and probable transmission pathways involved in the zoonotic transmission of M. bovis from animals to humans for better designation and development of specific preventive measures and guidelines that could reduce the risk of transmission and to protect these different occupational-related/populations at risk. Effective control and disease management of zoonotic tuberculosis caused by M. bovis in humans are also hindered by various challenges and factors involved at animal–human interface. A closer look into factors affecting proper disease control and management of M. bovis are therefore warranted. Hence, in this narrative review, we have gathered a number of different studies to highlight the risk of occupational exposure to M. bovis infection and addressed the limitations and challenges underlying this context. This review also shed lights on various components and approaches in tackling M. bovis infection at animal–human interface.","Devi, K. Renuga; Lee, L.

This was a cross-sectional study that recruited a convenience sample of 4471 (20.5% HIV positive) adults in Nigeria. Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to test the associations between the explanatory variable (HIV positive and non-positive status) and the outcome variables—COVID-19 related behavior changes (physical distancing, isolation/quarantine, working remotely) and food insecurity (hungry but did not eat, cut the size of meals/skip meals) controlling for age, sex at birth, COVID-19 status, and medical status of respondents. Significantly fewer people living with HIV (PLWH) reported a positive COVID-19 test result; and had lower odds of practicing COVID-19 risk preventive behaviors. In comparison with those living without HIV, PLWH had higher odds of cutting meal sizes as a food security measure (AOR: 3.18; 95% CI 2.60–3.88) and lower odds of being hungry and not eating (AOR: 0.24; 95% CI 0.20–0.30).

In this review, we summarized the drugs tested as COVID-19 treatment and the advantages of antiviral nanostructured drug-delivery systems. Such systems have demonstrated low in vitro toxicity with better in vitro antiviral activity than free drugs.

The aims of this study to help health workers better understand the epidemic of the COVID-19 and provide different control strategies toward Hubei Province and other regions in China. Methods A comprehensive search of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention official websites and announcements was performed between 20 Jan 2019 and 29 Feb 2020. The relevant data of the distribution of the infection on each reported day were obtained. Results& findings Up to 29 Feb 2020, 79,824 confirmed cases with the COVID-19 including 66,907 in Hubei Province and 12,377 in other administrative regions were reported. The SARS-COV-2 showed faster epidemic trends compared with the 2003-SARS-CoV. A total of 2,870 deaths have been reported nationwide among 79,824 confirmed cases, with a mortality of 3.6%. The mortality of the COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei Province than that in other regions(4.1% versus 0.84%). Since 1 Feb 2020 the number of discharged cases exceeded the number of the dead. By 29 Feb 2020, the number of discharged patients was 41,625, which exceeded the number of hospitalized patients, and the trend has further increased. Conclusions The infection of the SARS-COV-2 is spreading and increasing nationwide, and Hubei Province is the main epidemic area, with higher mortality. The outbreak is now under initial control especially in other regions outside of Hubei Province. Due to the different epidemic characteristics between Hubei Province and other regions, we should focus on different prevention and control strategies.","Du, Wenjun; Han, Shaolei; Li, Qiang; Zhang, Zhongfa",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302460?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220302460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32325276/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.031,383

Such general population control measures could significantly influence perception, knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. Here, we assessed KAP towards COVID-19 immediately after the lock-down measures were implemented and during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. Online-based cross-sectional study conducted from March 29 to April 19, 2020, involving Bangladeshi residents aged 12–64 years, recruited via social media. After consenting, participants completed an online survey assessing socio-demographic variables, perception, and KAP towards COVID-19. Of the 2017 survey participants, 59.8% were male, the majority were students (71.2%), aged 21–30 years (57.9%), having a bachelor's degree (61.0%), having family income >30,000 BDT (50.0%), and living in urban areas (69.8). The survey revealed that 48.3% of participants had more accurate knowledge, 62.3% had more positive attitudes, and 55.1% had more frequent practices regarding COVID-19 prevention. Majority (96.7%) of the participants agreed ‘COVID-19 is a dangerous disease’, almost all (98.7%) participants wore a face mask in crowded places, 98.8% agreed to report a suspected case to health authorities, and 93.8% implemented washing hands with soap and water. In multiple logistic regression analyses, COVID-19 more accurate knowledge was associated with age and residence. Sociodemographic factors such as being older, higher education, employment, monthly family income >30,000 BDT, and having more frequent prevention practices were the more positive attitude factors. More frequent prevention practice factors were associated with female sex, older age, higher education, family income > 30,000 BDT, urban area residence, and having more positive attitudes. To improve KAP of general populations is crucial during the rapid rise period of a pandemic outbreak such as COVID-19. Therefore, development of effective health education programs that incorporate considerations of KAP-modifying factors is needed.","Ferdous, Most. Zannatul; Islam, Md. Saiful; Sikder, Md.

A retrospective study from a NYC Hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak,2021-04-08,"AIM: To investigate the prevalence of human bocavirus (hBoV), human coronaviruses (hCoV), and human polyomaviruses (hPyV) among patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), in South Africa. METHODS: The study included 680 South African patients randomly selected in age‐defined categories from hospitalised patients enrolled through SARI surveillance during 2012 to 2013. A multiplex reverse transcription real‐time polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect hBoV; hCoV‐OC43, hCoV‐229E, hCoV‐NL63, and hCoV‐HKU1; and Washington University hPyV (hPyV‐WU) and Karolinska Insitute hPyV (hPyV‐KI), in respiratory tract specimens collected from patients with SARI. All respiratory specimens from patients enrolled through SARI surveillance were also routinely tested by multiplex reverse transcription real‐time polymerase chain reaction for adenovirus; enterovirus; human metapneumovirus; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus; rhinovirus; influenza A, and influenza B. RESULTS: Human bocavirus, hCoV‐229E, and hPyV‐WU were detected in 3.7% (25/680), 4.1% (28/680), and 4.1% (28/680) of respiratory specimens, respectively. All other viruses were detected in <2% of specimens. Rhinovirus was the most common coinfecting virus (21.4%‐60.7%), followed by adenovirus (21.4%‐39.3%), and respiratory syncytial virus (10.7%‐24.0%). Testing for the additional viruses (hBoV, hCoV, and hPyV) decreased the number of specimens that initially tested negative by 2.9% (20/680). CONCLUSION: Inclusion of laboratory tests for hBoV, hCoV‐229E, and hPyV‐WU in differential testing algorithms for surveillance and diagnostics for suspected cases of respiratory illness of unknown cause may improve our understanding of the etiology of SARI, especially in a country like South Africa with a high number of immune compromised persons.","Subramoney, Kathleen; Hellferscee, Orienka; Pretorius, Marthi; Tempia, Stefano; McMorrow, Meredith; von Gottberg, Anne; Wolter, Nicole; Variava, Ebrahim; Dawood, Halima; Kahn, Kathleen; Walaza, Sibongile; Madhi, Shabir A.; Cohen, Cheryl; Venter, Marietjie; Treurnicht, Florette K.",Health Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30623094/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.59,383

Fever is a cardinal sign of this rampant infection; however, little attention has been paid towards how a fever may work in our favor in overcoming this disease. Three key aspects of patient care – fever, fluid, and food–can be harmonized to overcome COVID-19 infection. Both animal and human studies have demonstrated that fever suppression during viral infections, either through low ambient temperatures or antipyretic use, may increase morbidity and prolong the illness. As fever rises, so do antidiuretic hormone levels, leading to solute-free water retention – making conservative fluid management essential. Finally, fever inhibits gastrointestinal function as energy is reallocated to the immunological response, underscoring the need to work in concert with these physiological changes. An opportunity awaits to investigate this natural barrier to infection, let us not pass it by.","Cann, Stephen A Hoption",Am J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjms.2021.01.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781387/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002962921000045?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002962921000045,383
595901,Transforming the Orthopaedic Patient Experience Through Telemedicine,2020-05-27,"With the presence of novel coronavirus disease at the end of 2019, several approaches were proposed to help physicians detect the disease, such as using deep learning to recognize lung involvement based on the pattern of pneumonia. These approaches rely on analyzing the CT images and exploring the COVID-19 pathologies in the lung. Most of the successful methods are based on the deep learning technique, which is state-of-the-art. Nevertheless, the big drawback of the deep approaches is their need for many samples, which is not always possible. This work proposes a combined deep architecture that benefits both employed architectures of DenseNet and CapsNet. To more generalize the deep model, we propose a regularization term with much fewer parameters. The network convergence significantly improved, especially when the number of training data is small. We also propose a novel Cost-sensitive loss function for imbalanced data that makes our model feasible for the condition with a limited number of positive data. Our novelties make our approach more intelligent and potent in real-world situations with imbalanced data, popular in hospitals. We analyzed our approach on two publicly available datasets, HUST and COVID-CT, with different protocols. In the first protocol of HUST, we followed the original paper setup and outperformed it. With the second protocol of HUST, we show our approach superiority concerning imbalanced data. Finally, with three different validations of the COVID-CT, we provide evaluations in the presence of a low number of data along with a comparison with state-of-the-art.","Javidi, Malihe; Abbaasi, Saeid; Naybandi Atashi, Sara; Jampour, Mahdi",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97901-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34531477/,383

We evaluated for the first time in Romania the quality of life among patients with post-stroke spasticity, comparing two therapies over a 6-month period: botulinum toxin type A (BOT) with conventional therapy (CON). We also assessed the reduction of spasticity and functionality secondary to the increase in the mobility in upper limbs. This study was based on a prospective, randomized design, including subjects with post-stroke spasticity (N = 34; 34–80 years of age): in the CON arm, patients received therapy against muscle spasticity and physiotherapy, and, in the BOT arm, patients received incobotulinumtoxin-A and additionally conventional treatment, if required. Among 34 treated subjects in the two arms, the quality of life was significantly higher after BOT therapy (p < 0.001), represented by improvement in movement (p < 0.001), usual activities (p = 0.018), and distress (p < 0.001). Improvements in muscle tone (Ashworth Scale) over 6 months of treatment period were greater in the BOT arm (100%) than in the CON arm (11.8%). These preliminary results suggested that incobotulinumtoxin-A increased quality of life by improving movement, daily activities, mental health, and muscle tone more effectively than conventional therapy and could form a basis for future comparator studies.","Turcu-Stiolica, Adina; Subtirelu, Mihaela-Simona; Bumbea, Ana-Maria",Brain Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11070934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34356168/,383

596446,Laboratory parameters and outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 adults with COVID-19: a scoping review,2021-07-10,"Background: Hydroxychloroquine has recently received Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA and is currently prescribed in combination with azithromycin for COVID-19 pneumonia. We studied the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin. Methods: New user cohort studies were conducted including 16 severe adverse events (SAEs). Rheumatoid arthritis patients aged 18+ and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared to those initiating sulfasalazine and followed up over 30 days. Self-controlled case series (SCCS) were conducted to further establish safety in wider populations. Separately, SAEs associated with hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin (compared to hydroxychloroquine-amoxicillin) were studied. Data comprised 14 sources of claims data or electronic medical records from Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, UK, and USA. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate calibrated hazard ratios (CalHRs) according to drug use. Estimates were pooled where I2<40%. Results: Overall, 956,374 and 310,350 users of hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine, and 323,122 and 351,956 users of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine-amoxicillin were included. No excess risk of SAEs was identified when 30-day hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were compared. SCCS confirmed these findings. However, when azithromycin was added to hydroxychloroquine, we observed an increased risk of 30-day cardiovascular mortality (CalHR2.19 [1.22-3.94]), chest pain/angina (CalHR 1.15 [95% CI 1.05-1.26]), and heart failure (CalHR 1.22 [95% CI 1.02-1.45]) Conclusions: Short-term hydroxychloroquine treatment is safe, but addition of azithromycin may induce heart failure and cardiovascular mortality, potentially due to synergistic effects on QT length. We call for caution if such combination is to be used in the management of Covid-19.","Lane, J. C. E.; Weaver, J.; Kostka, K.; Duarte-Salles, T.; Abrahao, M. T.

596549,Translating economic evaluations into financing strategies for implementing evidence-based practices,2021-06-29,"BACKGROUND: The functional role of ELR-positive CXC chemokines during viral – induced demyelination was assessed. Inoculation of the neuroattenuated JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) into the CNS of susceptible mice results in an acute encephalomyelitis that evolves into a chronic demyelinating disease, modeling white matter pathology observed in the human demyelinating disease Multiple Sclerosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: JHMV infection induced the rapid and sustained expression of transcripts specific for the ELR (+) chemokine ligands CXCL1 and CXCL2, as well as their binding receptor CXCR2, which was enriched within the spinal cord during chronic infection. Inhibiting CXCR2 signaling with neutralizing antiserum significantly (p<0.03) delayed clinical recovery. Moreover, CXCR2 neutralization was associated with an increase in the severity of demyelination that was independent of viral recrudescence or modulation of neuroinflammation. Rather, blocking CXCR2 was associated with increased numbers of apoptotic cells primarily within white matter tracts, suggesting that oligodendrocytes were affected. JHMV infection of enriched oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) cultures revealed that apoptosis was associated with elevated expression of cleaved caspase 3 and muted Bcl-2 expression. Inclusion of CXCL1 within JHMV infected cultures restricted caspase 3 cleavage and increased Bcl-2 expression that was associated with a significant (p<0.001) decrease in apoptosis. CXCR2 deficient oligodendrocytes were refractory to CXCL1 mediated protection from JHMV – induced apoptosis, readily activating caspase 3 and down regulating Bcl-2. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings highlight a previously unappreciated role for CXCR2 signaling in protecting oligodendrocyte lineage cells from apoptosis during inflammatory demyelination initiated by viral infection of the CNS.","Hosking, Martin P.; Tirotta, Emanuele; Ransohoff, Richard M.; Lane, Thomas E.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20596532/,383

Laparoscopy in these Trying Times?,2020-05-24,"BACKGROUND: Task shifting and sharing (TS/S) involves the redistribution of health tasks within workforces and communities. Conceptual frameworks lay out the key factors, constructs, and variables involved in a given phenomenon, as well as the relationships between those factors. Though TS/S is a leading strategy to address health worker shortages and improve access to services worldwide, a conceptual framework for this approach is lacking. METHODS: We used an online Delphi process to engage an international panel of scholars with experience in knowledge synthesis concerning TS/S and develop a conceptual framework for TS/S. We invited 55 prospective panelists to participate in a series of questionnaires exploring the purpose of TS/S and the characteristics of contexts amenable to TS/S programmes. Panelist responses were analysed and integrated through an iterative process to achieve consensus on the elements included in the conceptual framework. RESULTS: The panel achieved consensus concerning the included concepts after three Delphi rounds among 15 panelists. The COATS Framework (Concepts and Opportunities to Advance Task Shifting and Task Sharing) offers a refined definition of TS/S and a general purpose statement to guide TS/S programmes. COATS describes that opportunities for health system improvement arising from TS/S programmes depending on the implementation context, and enumerates eight necessary conditions and important considerations for implementing TS/S programmes. CONCLUSION: The COATS Framework offers a conceptual model for TS/S programmes. The COATS Framework is comprehensive and adaptable, and can guide refinements in policy, programme development, evaluation, and research to improve TS/S globally.

597762,The Janus of COVID-19: from registry data to prospective studies,2021-06-24,"BACKGROUND: As many countries seek to slow the spread of COVID-19 without reimposing national restrictions, it has become important to track the disease at a local level to identify areas in need of targeted intervention. METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, we did modelling using longitudinal, self-reported data from users of the COVID Symptom Study app in England between March 24, and Sept 29, 2020. Beginning on April 28, in England, the Department of Health and Social Care allocated RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 to app users who logged themselves as healthy at least once in 9 days and then reported any symptom. We calculated incidence of COVID-19 using the invited swab (RT-PCR) tests reported in the app, and we estimated prevalence using a symptom-based method (using logistic regression) and a method based on both symptoms and swab test results. We used incidence rates to estimate the effective reproduction number, R(t), modelling the system as a Poisson process and using Markov Chain Monte-Carlo. We used three datasets to validate our models: the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey, the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT-1) study, and UK Government testing data. We used geographically granular estimates to highlight regions with rapidly increasing case numbers, or hotspots. FINDINGS: From March 24 to Sept 29, 2020, a total of 2 873 726 users living in England signed up to use the app, of whom 2 842 732 (98·9%) provided valid age information and daily assessments. These users provided a total of 120 192 306 daily reports of their symptoms, and recorded the results of 169 682 invited swab tests. On a national level, our estimates of incidence and prevalence showed a similar sensitivity to changes to those reported in the ONS and REACT-1 studies. On Sept 28, 2020, we estimated an incidence of 15 841 (95% CI 14 023–17 885) daily cases, a prevalence of 0·53% (0·45–0·60), and R(t) of 1·17 (1·15–1·19) in England. On a geographically granular level, on Sept 28, 2020, we detected 15 (75%) of the 20 regions with highest incidence according to government test data. INTERPRETATION: Our method could help to detect rapid case increases in regions where government testing provision is lower. Self-reported data from mobile applications can provide an agile resource to inform policy makers during a quickly moving pandemic, serving as a complementary resource to more traditional instruments for disease surveillance.

The E-SuPer instrument was tested and cross-validated using two cross-sectional survey studies (n = 153 and n = 160), focusing on factorial validity, internal consistency, and discriminant and concurrent validity. Psychometric findings across the two samples revealed that the E-SuPer instrument consists of one general factor of ten items with good internal consistency.

To date, risk prediction models for COVID-19-related incidence and outcomes in haemodialysis (HD) patients are missing. METHOD: We developed risk prediction models for COVID-19 incidence and mortality among HD patients. We studied 38 256 HD patients from a multi-national dialysis cohort between March 3rd and July 3rd 2020. Risk prediction models were developed and validated, based on predictors readily available in outpatient haemodialysis units. We compared mortality among patients with and without COVID-19, matched for age, sex, and diabetes. RESULTS: During the observational period, 1 259 patients (3.3%) acquired COVID-19. Of these, 62% were hospitalised or died. Mortality was 22% among COVID-19 patients with odds ratios 219.8 (95% CI 80.6-359) to 342.7 (95% CI 60.6-13595.1), compared to matched patients without COVID-19. Since the first wave of the pandemic affected mostly European countries during the study, the risk prediction model for incidence of COVID-19 was developed and validated in European patients only (N=22 826, AUCDev 0.64, AUCVal 0.69). The model for prediction of mortality was developed in all COVID-19 patients (AUCDev 0.71, AUCVal 0.78). Angiotensin receptor blockers were independently associated with a lower incidence of COVID-19 in European patients. CONCLUSION: We identified modifiable risk factors for COVID-19 incidence and outcome in HD patients. Our risk prediction tools can be readily applied in clinical practice.

The objective of this study is to gain insight into the behavioral intention of nurses, i.e. chinese nurses of the future, to use a mobile nursing application. This study adopted an extension of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology to examine Chinese nurses’ acceptance of a mobile nursing application. METHODS: A total of 1207 nurses participated in the cross-sectional survey. The majority of nurses were female (96.2%). The mean age of the participants was 34.18 (SD 7.39). The hypothesized relationships were tested using AMOS structural equation model. RESULTS: All constructs exhibited an acceptable level of reliability and validity with Cα and CR > 0.7 and AVE > 0.5. An extension of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology Model had good explanatory power for nurses’ behavioral intention of a mobile nursing application. Although effort expectancy and perceived risks had a surprisingly insignificant effect on nurses’ behavioral intention to use a mobile nursing application, performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, self-efficacy, and perceived incentives demonstrated significant influence with β = .259, p < .001, β = .296, p < .001, β = .063, p = .037, β = .344, p < .001, β = .091, p = .001, respectively. CONCLUSION: With 70.2% of the variance in behavioral intention to use a mobile nursing app explained by this model, it could be helpful for potential adopters, and further investigation should test the actual usage behavior for a mobile nursing app and investigate the related factors.

COVID-19 pneumonia has characteristic radiological features. Recent evidence indicates usefulness of chest X-ray and lung ultrasound (LUS) in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study, chest X-ray and LUS features of 50 adults with COVID-19 pneumonia at the time of presentation were described. RESULTS: Chest X-ray findings were present in 96% of patients, whereas all patients have ultrasound finding. Proportion (95% CI) of patients having bilateral opacities in chest X-ray was 96% (86.5–98.9%), ground glass opacity 74% (60.5–84.1%), and consolidation 50% (36.7–63.4%). In LUS, shred sign and thickened pleura was present in all patients recruited in this study. Air bronchogram was present in at least one area in 80% of all patients and B-lines score of more than 2 was present in at least one lung area in 84% patients. Number of lung areas with “shred sign” were higher in hypoxemic (p = 0.005) and tachypneic (p = 0.006) patients and pleura line abnormalities were present in more lung areas in hypoxemic patients (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: According to our study, LUS is a useful tool not only in diagnosing, but it also correlates with requirement of respiratory support in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: After NAFLD screening in an outpatient Infectious Diseases Clinic, NAFLD patients were randomly allocated to general dietary recommendations (SC group) or to a structured dietary intervention based on the Mediterranean diet (intervention group). During lockdown, follow-up consultations in the intervention group were done by video and/or phone. After 3 months of lockdown, all patients (intervention and SC group) consented to a telephone interview which aimed to characterize eating habits and lifestyle changes and evaluate stress and depression. Biochemical data when available, was compared between the peri-period of confinement. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve patients were screened. From the 55 NAFDL identified, 27 were allocated to dietary intervention and 28 to SC and were followed before lockdown for a mean period of 5.0 ± 1.5 months in which SC group gained a median of 0.65 kg vs. a median loss of 1.5 kg in the intervention group (p < 0.001). During lockdown, 93.3% of patients in the SC group referred that “diet got worse” vs. 6.7% in the intervention group p < 0.01), and 35.3% vs. 15.7% (p = 0.014) reported increase in appetite, respectively. Both groups gained weight, SC group vs. 0.7 ± 1.7 kg in the intervention group, p < 0.001). Higher weight gain was associated with changes in the dietary pattern (3.8 ± 2.1 kg vs. 2.0 ± 1.3 kg in “no change in dietary pattern”; p = 0.002).

There are currently no standardized techniques for training residents in this procedure. Cognitive task analysis (CTA) is a method of analyzing and standardizing key steps in a procedure that allows training to be conducted in a validated and reproducible manner. PURPOSE: (1) To design a digital CTA teaching tool for a standardized all-inside meniscal repair. (2) To evaluate whether CTA-trained residents would perform better in a meniscal repair task compared with a control group who underwent traditional apprenticeship methods of training. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Three expert knee surgeons were interviewed using a modified Delphi method to generate a consensus among the ideal technical steps, cognitive decision points, and common errors and solutions for an all-inside meniscal repair. This written information was then combined with visual and audio components and integrated onto a digital platform to create the Imperial College London/University College London Meniscus Repair Cognitive Task Analysis (IUMeRCTA) tool. Eighteen novice residents were randomized into an intervention group (digital CTA tool) and control group (equipment instruction manual). Both groups performed an all-inside meniscal repair on high-fidelity, phantom knee models and were assessed by expert surgeons, blinded to the interventions, using a validated global rating scale (GRS). After a power calculation, median GRS scores were compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney U test; significance was set at P < .05. RESULTS: For the IUMeRCTA tool design, the procedure was divided into 55 steps across 9 phases: (1) preoperative planning, (2) theater and patient setup, (3) portal placement, (4) meniscal examination, (5) tear reduction, (6) suture planning, (7) suture insertion, (8) repair completion, and (9) postoperative care and rehabilitation. For the trial, the intervention group (mean ± SD GRS, 32 ± 2.9) performed significantly better than did the control group (GRS, 24 ± 3.3; P < .001). CONCLUSION: This is the first CTA tool to demonstrate objective benefits in training novices to perform an arthroscopic all-inside meniscal repair. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The IUMeRCTA tool is an easily accessible and effective adjunct to traditional teaching that enhances learning the all-inside meniscal repair for novice surgeons.","Karamchandani, Urvi; Bhattacharyya, Rahul; Patel, Rahul; Oussedik, Sam; Bhattacharya, Rajarshi; Gupte, Chinmay",Am J Sports Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34166100/; https://doi.org/10.1177/03635465211021652,383

Accordingly, cities experienced a significant decrease of CO(2) emissions. In this study, continuous measurements of CO(2) fluxes, atmospheric CO(2) concentrations and δ(13)C-CO(2) values were performed in the historical center of Florence (Italy) before, during and after the almost two-month long national lockdown. The temporal trends of the analyzed parameters, combined with the variations in emitting source categories (from inventory data), evidenced a fast response of flux measurements to variations in the strength of the emitting sources. Similarly, the δ(13)C-CO(2) values recorded the change in the prevailing sources contributing to urban atmospheric CO(2), confirming the effectiveness of carbon isotopic data as geochemical tracers for identifying and quantifying the relative contributions of emitting sources. Although the direct impact of restriction measurements on CO(2) concentrations was less clear due to seasonal trends and background fluctuations, an in-depth analysis of the daily local CO(2) enhancement with respect to the background values revealed a progressive decrease throughout the lockdown phase at the end of the heating season (>10 ppm), followed by a net increase (ca. 5 ppm) with the resumption of traffic.

However, the effects of Pelargonium sidoides and a special extract prepared from its roots (EPs 7630) on human immune cells are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that EPs 7630 induced a rapid and dose-dependent production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 by human blood immune cells. This EPs 7630-induced cytokine profile was more pro-inflammatory in comparison with the profile induced by viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents. The search for EPs 7630 target cells revealed that T-cells did not respond to EPs 7630 stimulation by production of TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-10. Furthermore, pretreatment of T-cells with EPs 7630 did not modulate their TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 secretion during subsequent activation. In contrast to lymphocytes, monocytes showed clear intracellular TNF-α staining after EPs 7630 treatment. Accordingly, EPs 7630 predominantly provoked activation of MAP kinases and inhibition of p38 strongly reduced the monocyte TNF-α production. The pretreatment of blood immune cells with EPs 7630 lowered their secretion of TNF-α and IL-10 and caused an IL-6 dominant response during second stimulation with viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents. In summary, we demonstrate that EPs 7630 activates human monocytes, induces MAP kinase-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines in these cells, and specifically modulates their production capacity of mediators known to lead to an increase of acute phase protein production in the liver, neutrophil generation in the bone marrow, and the generation of adaptive Th17 and Th22 cells.","Witte, Katrin; Koch, Egon; Volk, Hans-Dieter; Wolk, Kerstin; Sabat, Robert",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26406906/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0138075,383

The ventilation bundle focuses on prevention of specific complications of mechanical ventilation; ventilator-associated pneumonia, sepsis, barotrauma, pulmonary oedema, pulmonary embolism, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement ventilation bundle consists of five structured evidence-based interventions: head of the bed elevation at 30–45°; daily sedation interruptions and assessment of readiness to extubate; peptic ulcer prophylaxis; deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis; and daily oral care with chlorhexidine. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to evaluate the use of the ventilation bundle in two intensive care units in Victoria, Australia. METHODS: This is a 3-month prospective observational study in two intensive care units. Patient medical records were reviewed on days 3, 4, and 5 of mechanical ventilation using a prevalidated ventilation bundle checklist. RESULTS: A total of 96 critically ill patients required mechanical ventilation for more than 2 d. Patients had a mean age of 64.50 y (standard deviation = 14.89), with an Acute Physiology, Age, Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III mean score of 79.27 (standard deviation = 27.11). The mean ventilation bundle compliance rate was 88.3% on the three consecutive mechanical ventilation days (day 3 = 79.4%, day 4 = 91.1%, and day 5 = 96.7%). There was a statistically significant difference in the mean APACHE III score between patients who had head of bed elevation and those without head of bed elevation, on days 3 (p = <0.001) and 4 (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: The ventilation bundle elements were used in Australian intensive care units. The likelihood of having all ventilation bundle elements on day 3 was low if the patient's APACHE III score was high.

However, RSV also causes a high disease burden in the elderly that is often under recognized. Adults >65 years of age account for an estimated 80,000 RSV-associated hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths in the United States annually. RSV infection in aged individuals can result in more severe disease symptoms including pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Given the large disease burden caused by RSV in the aged, this population remains an important target for vaccine development. Aging results in lowered immune responsiveness characterized by impairments in both innate and adaptive immunity. This immune senescence poses a challenge when developing a vaccine targeting elderly individuals. An RSV vaccine tailored towards an elderly population will need to maximize the immune response elicited in order to overcome age-related defects in the immune system. In this article, we review the hurdles that must be overcome to successfully develop an RSV vaccine for use in the elderly, and discuss the vaccine candidates currently being tested in this highly susceptible population.","Stephens, Laura M.; Varga, Steven M.",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34207770/,383

Objective: The aim of this study is to adapt the Global Psychotrauma Screen (GPS) for children and adolescents in the United States. Method: Using the modified Delphi method, this study included the GPS Expert Consensus (GPS-EC) and the GPS Stakeholder Consensus (GPS-SC) substudies. In the GPS-EC, ten reviewers who specialize in trauma services independently revised the GPS child and adolescent versions in four rounds. In the GPS-SC, a stratified minimum sample of children and adolescents (n = 24) and their parents (n = 24) were interviewed to collect feedback on the revised GPS versions. Results: In the GPS-EC Round 1, a low level of consensus was observed on the anxiety (restlessness) and depression (loss of interest) items. In Round 2, a high level of consensus was achieved on all but PTSD hypervigilance and detachment, and CPTSD self-concept items. Round 3 indicated a low level of consensus on the exposure and functioning items. Full consensus was achieved in Round 4 on all items.

CONCLUSIONS: Participants administered citalopram showed greater prosocial behaviours, increased positive recall and increased positive learning of social evaluations towards others. The increase in positive affective bias and prosocial behaviours towards others may, at least partially, be a mechanism of antidepressant effect. However, we found no evidence that citalopram influenced self-referential processing.","Hobbs, Catherine; Murphy, Susannah E.; Wright, Lucy; Carson, James; Assche, Indra Van; O'Brien, Jessica; Oyesanya, Mayowa; Sui, Jie; Munafò, Marcus R.; Kessler, David; Harmer, Catherine J.; Button, Katherine S.",BJPsych Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070796/; https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.107,383
604608,COVID 19-Depression and Neurosurgeons,2020-06-06,"Serology has provided valuable diagnostic and epidemiological data on antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in diverse patient cohorts. Deployment of high content, multiplex serology platforms across the world, including in low and medium income countries, can accelerate longitudinal epidemiological surveys. Here we report multiSero, an open platform to enable multiplex serology with up to 48 antigens in a 96-well format. The platform consists of three components: ELISA-array of printed proteins, a commercial or home-built plate reader, and modular python software for automated analysis (pysero). We validate the platform by comparing antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, receptor binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (N) in 114 sera from COVID-19 positive individuals and 87 pre-pandemic COVID-19 negative sera. We report data with both a commercial plate reader and an inexpensive, open plate reader (nautilus). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of classification with single antigens shows that Spike and RBD classify positive and negative sera with the highest sensitivity at a given specificity. The platform distinguished positive sera from negative sera when the reactivity of the sera was equivalent to the binding of 1 ng mL(−1) RBD-specific monoclonal antibody. We developed normalization and classification methods to pool antibody responses from multiple antigens and multiple experiments. Our results demonstrate a performant and accessible pipeline for multiplexed ELISA ready for multiple applications, including serosurveillance, identification of viral proteins that elicit antibody responses, differential diagnosis of circulating pathogens, and immune responses to vaccines.","Byrum, Janie R.; Waltari, Eric; Janson, Owen; Guo, Syuan-Ming; Folkesson, Jenny; Chhun, Bryant B.; Vinden, Joanna; Ivanov, Ivan E.; Forst, Marcus L.; Li, Hongquan; Larson, Adam G.; Wu, Wesley; Tato, Cristina M.; McCutcheon, Krista M.; Peluso, Michael J.; Henrich, Timothy J.; Deeks, Steven G.; Prakash, Manu; Greenhouse, Bryan; Pak, John E.; Mehta, Shalin B.",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013298/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.07.21249238v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.07.21249238,383
605031,A Review of Salivary Diagnostics and Its Potential Implication in Detection of Covid-19,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a severe inflammatory condition. Patients with pre-existing conditions including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk of complications. Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is an ultra-rare and debilitating genetic disorder that is characterized by a pro-inflammatory state, which leads to progressive heterotopic ossification and complications after trauma, including intramuscular vaccinations. To better understand the impact of COVID-19 on patients with FOP, we first examined the social impact of the pandemic using data from the FOP Registry managed by the International FOP Association. We also identified patients with FOP who were exposed to or contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or who received a COVID-19 vaccine, to investigate if patients with FOP were at increased risks of complications from SARS-CoV2 exposure. RESULTS: Data from 326 individuals in 69 countries were examined in the International FOP Association FOP Connection Registry using patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) global health scale scores. Twenty-six (28.9%) participants aged ≥ 15 years old rated their satisfaction with their social activities and relationships as poor in 2020, which was an increase from 18 (18.9%) in 2019, prior to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Similar trends were noted for physical and mental health in the pediatric population. Frequency of physician visits was not changed, but a larger portion of patients reported missing dental visits in 2020 compared with 2019 (31.5% vs. 41.7%). A second cohort with 32 subjects was tracked after SARS-CoV-2 exposure or vaccination. Ten subjects were positively diagnosed with COVID-19, 15 received a COVID-19 vaccine, and seven had high-risk SARS-CoV-2 exposure but either did not have a confirmed clinical diagnosis or tested negative. Subjects who tested positive for the virus showed no major complications or increased FOP disease activity, though our sample size is very limited. Among the 15 subjects who received a COVID-19 vaccine, using the International Clinical Council on FOP guidelines for prophylaxis with ibuprofen or acetaminophen, only one person experienced flare activity at the injection site. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with FOP showed a significant decrease in social activities that was reflective of the isolation and mobility changes in this debilitated population. In our limited cohort, the majority of the patients with FOP who tested positive for COVID-19 showed no major complications. Also, although limited in sample size, the majority of patients who received a COVID-19 vaccination and followed guidelines from the FOP International Clinical Council tolerated vaccination well. Only one person experiencing flare activity following their injection. Thus, the risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination needs to be discussed carefully so as to support informed decisions.","Kou, Samuel; Kile, Sammi; Kambampati, Sai Samhith; Brady, Evelyn C.; Wallace, Hayley; De Sousa, Carlos M.; Cheung, Kin; Dickey, Lauren; Wentworth, Kelly L.; Hsiao, Edward",Res Sq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34545360/; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-885603/v1,383

606041,"COVID-19 and Cognitive Impairment: Severity, Evolution, and Functional Impact during Inpatient Rehabilitation",2021-03-17,"Abstract The spike glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 mediates the early events leading to infection of cells, including fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The spike is a type I membrane glycoprotein that possesses a conserved transmembrane anchor and an unusual cysteine-rich (cys) domain that bridges the putative junction of the anchor and the cytoplasmic tail. In this study, we examined the role of these carboxyl-terminal domains in spike-mediated membrane fusion. We show that the cytoplasmic tail is not required for fusion but has the capacity to enhance membrane fusion activity. Chimeric spike protein mutants containing substitutions of the entire transmembrane anchor and cys domain with the herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein D (gD-1) anchor demonstrated that fusion activity requires the presence of the A59 membrane-spanning domain and the portion of the cys domain that lies upstream of the cytoplasmic tail. The cys domain is a required element since its deletion from the wild-type spike protein abrogates fusion activity. However, addition of the cys domain to fusion-defective chimeric proteins was unable to restore fusion activity. Thus, the cys domain is necessary but is not sufficient to complement the gD-1 anchor and allow for membrane fusion. Site-specific mutations of conserved cysteine residues in the cys domain markedly reduce membrane fusion, which further supports the conclusion that this region is crucial for spike function. The results indicate that the carboxyl-terminus of the spike transmembrane anchor contains at least two distinct domains, both of which are necessary for full membrane fusion.","Chang, Kevin W.; Sheng, YiWei; Gombold, James L.",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682200902198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10725213/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682200902198,383

In this study, we examined the immunogenicity of CHO-expressed recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc fusion protein in mice, rabbits, and monkeys as a potential candidate for a COVID-19 vaccine. We demonstrate that the S1-Fc fusion protein is extremely immunogenic, as evidenced by strong antibody titers observed by day 7. Strong virus neutralizing activity was observed on day 14 in rabbits immunized with the S1-Fc fusion protein using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Most importantly, in less than 20 days and three injections of the S1-Fc fusion protein, two monkeys developed higher virus neutralizing titers than a recovered COVID-19 patient in a live SARS-CoV-2 infection assay. Our data strongly suggests that the CHO-expressed SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc recombinant protein could be a strong candidate for vaccine development against COVID-19. Highlights CHO-expressed S1-Fc protein is very immunogenic in various animals and can rapidly induce strong antibody production S1-Fc protein solicits strong neutralizing activities against live virus Stable CHO cell line expressing 50 mg/L of S1-Fc and a 3,000 L Bioreactor can produce 3 million doses of human COVID-19 vaccine every 10 days, making it an accessible and affordable option for worldwide vaccination","Ren, Wenlin; Sun, Hunter; Gao, George F.; Chen, Jianxin; Sun, Sean; Zhao, Rongqing; Gao, Guang; Hu, Yalin; Zhao, Gan; Chen, Yuxin; Jin, Xia; Fang, Feng; Chen, Jinggong; Wang, Qi; Gong, Sitao; Gao, Wen; Sun, Yufei; Su, Junchi; He, Ailiang; Cheng, Xin; Li, Min; Xia, Chenxi; Li, Maohua; Sun, Le",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.052209,383
606568,"Fertility patients under COVID-19: Attitudes, Perceptions, and Psychological Reactions",2020-09-02,"BACKGROUND: University students often experience numerous financial, social and emotional stressors that can affect their mental health. The Peer Support Centre (PSC) is a pilot project that was established to provide peer support to students in these stressful conditions. We wanted to investigate whether peer support is a viable form of support that would benefit university students. The objective of this study is to determine whether the organization was indeed providing a beneficial service to students and if it was fulfilling the needs of the students that visited the service. METHODS: After a support session, students and peer support providers completed an anonymous questionnaire regarding their self-reported mental wellbeing using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) metrics, and Outcome Rating Scale (ORS). They were also asked about their experience with previous professional mental health services as well as their experience at the PSC. With the data collected from 1043 students and 797 volunteers from September 2016–March 2020, a program evaluation was conducted for quality improvement purposes. RESULTS: The PSC is used by students of different sexes, genders, and ethnicities. Students reported having a low ORS score, moderate anxiety as per the GAD-7 and moderate depression according to the PHQ-9. They find it easy to use and rely on it as an alternative form of support when they approach barriers that prevent them from accessing professional services. Lastly, the peer support providers feel very validated in their role and overall quite prepared and helpful when helping their fellow peers. CONCLUSIONS: The establishment of a student service that provides peer support would be beneficial to the members of a university/college campus.

The objective of this study was to determine the epidemiological behavior of HMPV in Mexico. This retrospective study was conducted over a nine-year period and used 7283 influenza-negative respiratory samples from hospitalized and deceased patients who presented Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). The samples were processed with the help of qualitative multiplex RT-PCR for simultaneous detection of 14 respiratory viruses (xTAG(®) RVP FAST v2). 40.8% of the samples were positive for respiratory viruses, mainly rhinovirus/enterovirus (47.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (15.9%), HMPV (11.1%) and parainfluenza virus (8.9%). Other respiratory viruses and co-infections accounted for 16.5%. HMPV infects all age groups, but the most affected group was infants between 29 days and 9 years of age (65.6%) and adults who are 40 years and older (25.7%). HMPV circulates every year from November to April, and the highest circulation was observed in late winter. The results of this study aim to raise awareness among clinicians about the high epidemiological impact of HMPV in young children and older individuals in order to reduce the economic burden in terms of health care costs.","Barrera-Badillo, Gisela; Olivares-Flores, Beatriz; Ruiz-López, Adriana; Fierro-Valdez, Miguel Ángel; Gutiérrez-Vargas, Rosaura Idania; López-Martínez, Irma",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9020085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32013048/,383

Data were collected through an on-line survey and themes from open-ended questions were coded by the researchers using directed content analysis. Results highlighted a strong human–animal appreciation, and that dog ownership during this pandemic diminished participants’ sense of isolation and loneliness, as well as supported their mental/physical health. ABSTRACT: The Covid-19 pandemic has been found to negatively impact the psychological well-being of significant numbers of people globally. Many individuals have been challenged by social distancing mandates and the resultant social isolation. Humans, in our modern world, have rarely been as isolated and socially restricted. Social connectedness and support are critical protective factors for human survival and well-being. Social isolation can lead to loneliness, boredom, and can become a risk factor for physical and mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. The attachments formed with dogs, however, can be as strong or even stronger than human connections, and has been shown to relate to fewer physical health and mental health problems, as well as decrease isolation and loneliness. The purpose of this qualitative research was to examine the thoughts, experiences and concerns of 4105 adults regarding their companion dog during the initial months of Covid-19. Data were collected between March 31st–April 19th, 2020 via online survey and themes were coded by the researchers using directed content analysis.

608120,Geostatistical COVID-19 infection risk maps for Portugal,2020-07-06,"We replicate a recent study by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team (Flaxman et al, 2020) that estimates both the effective reproductive number, Rt, of the current COVID-19 epidemic in 11 European countries, and the impact of different nonpharmaceutical interventions that have been implemented to try to contain the epidemic. We improve on their estimation by using data from the number of patients in intensive care, which provides two advantages over the number of deaths: first, it can be used to construct a signal with less bias: as the healthcare system of a country reaches saturation, the mortality rate would be expected to increase, which would bias the estimates of Rt and of the impact of measures implemented to contain the epidemic; and second, it is a signal with less lag, as the time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission is shorter than the time from onset to death. The intensive care signal we use is not just the number of people in ICU, as this would also be biased if the healthcare system has reached saturation. Instead, we estimate the daily demand of intensive care, as the sum of two components: the part that is satisfied (new ICU admissions) and the part that is not (which results in excess mortality). Thanks to the advantages of this ICU signal in terms of timeliness and bias, we find that most of the countries in the study have already reached Rt<1 with 95% confidence (Italy, Spain, Austria, Denmark, France, Norway and Switzerland, but not Belgium or Sweden), whereas the original methodology of Flaxman et al (2020), even with updated data, would only find Rt<1 with 95% confidence for Italy and Switzerland.","Hurtado, Samuel; Tinajero, David",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063388,383

This study aimed to determine the incidence and outcomes of COVID‐19 in a large cohort of IBD patients on biologic therapy. METHODS: This observational retrospective multicenter study collected data about COVID‐19 in IBD patients on biologic therapy in Italy, between February and May 2020. The main end‐points were (i) to assess both the cumulative incidence and clinical outcome of COVID‐19, according to different biologic agents and (ii) to compare them with the general population and a cohort IBD patients undergoing non‐biologic therapies. RESULTS: Among 1816 IBD patients, the cumulative incidence of COVID‐19 was 3.9 per 1000 (7/1816) with a 57% hospitalization rate and a 29% case‐fatality rate. The class of biologic agents was the only risk factor of developing COVID‐19 (P = 0.01). Non‐gut selective agents were associated with a lower incidence of COVID‐19 cases, related symptoms, and hospitalization (P < 0.05). Compared with the general population of Lombardy, an overall lower incidence of COVID‐19 was observed (3.9 vs 8.5 per 1000, P = 0.03). Compared with 565 IBD patients on non‐biologic therapies, a lower rate of COVID‐19 symptoms was observed in our cohort (7.5% vs 18%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the general population, IBD patients on biologic therapy are not exposed to a higher risk of COVID‐19. Non‐gut selective agents are associated with a lower incidence of symptomatic disease, supporting the decision of maintaining the ongoing treatment.","Ardizzone, Sandro; Ferretti, Francesca; Monico, Maria Camilla; Carvalhas Gabrielli, Anna Maria; Carmagnola, Stefania; Bezzio, Cristina; Saibeni, Simone; Bosani, Matteo; Caprioli, Flavio; Mazza, Stefano; Casini, Valentina; Cortelezzi, Claudio Camillo; Parravicini, Marco; Cassinotti, Andrea; Cosimo, Paola; Indriolo, Amedeo; Di Sabatino, Antonio; Lenti, Marco Vincenzo; Pastorelli, Luca; Conforti, Francesco; Ricci, Chiara; Sarzi‐Puttini, Piercarlo; Vecchi, Maurizio; Maconi, Giovanni",J Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34159648/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15591,383

However, whether early radiographic change is a predictor of fatality remains unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of all laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to a quarantine unit at Tongji Hospital, a large regional hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 31 and March 5, 2020. Confirmed cases were defined by positive RT-PCR detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in throat-swab specimens. Chest CT images were reviewed independently by two radiologists. The Tongji Hospital ethics committee approved this study. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. As of March 25, 85 confirmed patients were discharged, 15 died, and 2 remained hospitalized. When compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (median age, 69 [interquartile range, 58–77] vs. 55 [44–66], p = 0.003), and more likely to have decreased lymphocyte count (0.5 vs. 0.9 × 10(9)/L, p = 0.006), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (569.0 vs. 272.0 U/L, p < 0.001), elevated d-dimer (> 1 μg/mL, 86% vs. 37%, p = 0.002) on admission. Older age and elevated LDH were independent risk factors for fatality in a multivariate regression model included the above variables. In a subset of patients with CT images within the first week, higher total severity score, and more involved lung lobes (5 involved lobes) in CT images within the first week were significantly associated with fatality. Moreover, in this subset of patients, higher total severity score was the only independent risk factor in a multivariate analysis incorporating the above mentioned variables. CONCLUSIONS: Older age, elevated LDH on admission, and higher severity score of CT images within the first week are potential predictors of fatality in adults with COVID-19. These predictors may help clinicians identify patients with a poor prognosis at an early stage.","Li, Kaiyan; Chen, Dian; Chen, Shengchong; Feng, Yuchen; Chang, Chenli; Wang, Zi; Wang, Nan; Zhen, Guohua",Respir Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-020-01411-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32527255/,383

In this review, we formulate a definition of multi-scale in terms of levels of biological organisation and describe the types of model that are found at each level. Key issues that arise in trying to formulate and solve multi-scale and multi-physics models are considered and examples of how these issues have been addressed are given for two of the more mature fields in computational biology: the molecular dynamics of ion channels and cardiac modelling. As even more complex models are developed over the coming few years, it will be necessary to develop new methods to model them (in particular in coupling across the interface between stochastic and deterministic processes) and new techniques will be required to compute their solutions efficiently on massively parallel computers.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis estimated the magnitude of sleep problems during the COVID-19 pandemic and its relationship with psychological distress. METHODS: Five academic databases (Scopus, PubMed Central, ProQuest, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Embase) were searched. Observational studies including case-control studies and cross-sectional studies were included if relevant data relationships were reported (i.e., sleep assessed utilizing the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index or Insomnia Severity Index). All the studies were English, peer-reviewed papers published between December 2019 and February 2021. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020181644. FINDINGS: 168 cross-sectional, four case-control, and five longitudinal design papers comprising 345,270 participants from 39 countries were identified. The corrected pooled estimated prevalence of sleep problems were 31% among healthcare professionals, 18% among the general population, and 57% among COVID-19 patients (all p-values < 0.05). Sleep problems were associated with depression among healthcare professionals, the general population, and COVID-19 patients, with Fisher's Z scores of -0.28, -0.30, and -0.36, respectively. Sleep problems were positively (and moderately) associated with anxiety among healthcare professionals, the general population, and COVID-19 patients, with Fisher's z scores of 0.55, 0.48, and 0.49, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Sleep problems appear to have been common during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, sleep problems were found to be associated with higher levels of psychological distress. With the use of effective programs treating sleep problems, psychological distress may be reduced. Vice versa, the use of effective programs treating psychological distress, sleep problems may be reduced.

At present, little is known about factors that will affect vaccine uptake, especially among diverse racial/ethnic communities that have experienced the highest burden of COVID. We administered an online survey to a Qualtrics respondent panel of women ages 27–45 years (N = 396) to assess vaccine intentions and attitudes, and trusted vaccine information sources. 56.8% intended to be vaccinated and 25.5% were unsure. In bivariate analyses, a greater percentage of non-Latina White (NLW) and Chinese women reported that they would be vaccinated, compared with Latina and non-Latina Black (NLB) women (p < 0.001). Those who were uninsured, unemployed and those with lower incomes were less likely to say that they would be vaccinated. In analyses stratified by race/ethnicity, NLB women remained significantly less likely to report that they would be vaccinated compared with NLW women (adjusted odds ratio: 0.47; 95% confidence interval: 0.23, 0.94), controlling for age, marital status, income, education, employment, and insurance status. When analyses were additionally controlled for beliefs in vaccine safety and efficacy, racial/ethnic differences were no longer significant (adjusted odds ratio: 0.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.31, 1.34). Given that NLB women were less likely to report the intention to be vaccinated, targeted efforts will be needed to promote vaccine uptake.

612322,Assessment and treatment of older individuals with COVID-19 multi-system disease: clinical and ethical implications,2020-05-11,"BACKGROUND: In the absence of effective drugs, controlling SARS relies on the rapid identification of cases and appropriate management of the close contacts, or effective vaccines for SARS. Therefore, developing specific and sensitive laboratory tests for SARS as well as effective vaccines are necessary for national authorities. RESULTS: Genes encoding truncated nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins of SARSCoV were cloned into the expression vector pQE30 and fusionally expressed in Escherichia coli M15. The fusion protein was analyzed for reactivity with SARS patients' sera and with anti-sera against the two human coronaviruses HCoV 229E and HCoV OC43 by ELISA, IFA and immunoblot assays. Furthermore, to evaluate the antigen-specific humoral antibody and T-cell responses in mice, the fusion protein was injected into 6-week-old BALB/c mice and a neutralization test as well as a T-cell analysis was performed. To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of immunization, BALB/c mice were challenged intranasally with SARSCoV at day 33 post injection and viral loads were determined by fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR. Serological results showed that the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the truncated S-N fusion protein derived the SARS virus were > 99% (457/460) and 100.00% (650/650), respectively. Furthermore there was no cross-reactivity with other two human coronaviruses. High titers of antibodies to SRASCoV appeared in the immunized mice and the neutralization test showed that antibodies to the fusion protein could inhibit SARSCoV. The T cell proliferation showed that the fusion protein could induce an antigen-specific T-cell response. Fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR showed that BALB/c mice challenged intranasally with SARSCoV at day 33 post injection were completely protected from virus replication. CONCLUSION: The truncated S-N fusion protein is a suitable immunodiagnostic antigen and vaccine candidate.","Mu, Feng; Niu, Dongsheng; Mu, Jingsong; He, Bo; Han, Weiguo; Fan, Baoxing; Huang, Shengyong; Qiu, Yan; You, Bo; Chen, Weijun",BMC Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19038059/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-8-207,383

The authors sought to describe practice for emergency intubation, estimate success rates and complications, and determine variation in practice and outcomes between high-income and low- and middle-income countries. The authors hypothesized that successful emergency airway management in patients with COVID-19 is associated with geographical and procedural factors. METHODS: The authors performed a prospective observational cohort study between March 23, 2020, and October 24, 2020, which included 4,476 episodes of emergency tracheal intubation performed by 1,722 clinicians from 607 institutions across 32 countries in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. The authors investigated associations between intubation and operator characteristics, and the primary outcome of first-attempt success. RESULTS: Successful first-attempt tracheal intubation was achieved in 4,017/4,476 (89.7%) episodes, while 23 of 4,476 (0.5%) episodes required four or more attempts. Ten emergency surgical airways were reported—an approximate incidence of 1 in 450 (10 of 4,476). Failed intubation (defined as emergency surgical airway, four or more attempts, or a supraglottic airway as the final device) occurred in approximately 1 of 120 episodes (36 of 4,476). Successful first attempt was more likely during rapid sequence induction versus non–rapid sequence induction (adjusted odds ratio, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.49 to 2.39]; P < 0.001), when operators used powered air-purifying respirators versus nonpowered respirators (adjusted odds ratio, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.16 to 2.20]; P=0.006), and when performed by operators with more COVID-19 intubations recorded (adjusted odds ratio, 1.03 for each additional previous intubation [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.06]; P=0.015). Intubations performed in low- or middle-income countries were less likely to be successful at first attempt than in high-income countries (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.79]; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The authors report rates of failed tracheal intubation and emergency surgical airway in patients with COVID-19 requiring emergency airway management, and identified factors associated with increased success.

With increasing COVID-19 cases, the amount of biomedical waste has increased manifolds making more people vulnerable to the pandemic. The developing and underdeveloped countries are already facing the challenges of waste management, and the waste generated during the pandemic scenario has added to the already existing challenges. The improper waste management practices need to be corrected; otherwise, the world will be facing a new disaster that could be termed as ‘waste disaster’. The increase in COVID-19-associated waste (CAW) quantity and their availability in the environment will result in their easy approach to other organisms, which will possibly increase the potential risk of food chain contamination. Some of the countries have already started to make backup plans and are struggling to overcome the ‘waste disaster’. In light of the limited knowledge available on the mutational properties and possible hosts of this newly emerged COVID-19, there is a great demand to have an efficient strategy to prevent the environment from further contamination in India. The necessity of the prevailing time is to create a more efficient, automatic, mechanized, and well-modified waste management system for handling the present situation and delaying the projected waste disaster in the near future in the era of COVID-19. The article aims to address the issues that originated from waste discharges, their potential sources along with possible sustainable solutions.

Even though protective vaccines are starting to be administered, an effective antiviral agent for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is not available yet. Moreover, since new and deadly CoVs can emerge at any time with the potential of becoming pandemics, the development of therapeutic agents against potentially deadly CoVs is a research area of much current interest. In the search for anti-coronaviral drugs, researchers soon turned their heads towards glycosylated flavonoids. Glycosyl flavonoids, widespread in the plant kingdom, have received a lot of attention due to their widely recognized antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anticarcinogenic, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, and antiviral properties together with their capacity to modulate key cellular functions. The wide range of biological activities displayed by glycosyl flavonoids, along with their low toxicity, make them ideal candidates for drug development. In this review, we examine and discuss the up-to-date developments on glycosyl flavonoids as evidence-based natural sources of antivirals against coronaviruses and their potential role in the management of COVID-19.","Godinho, Patrícia I.

We sought to develop a risk score for progression to LRTI from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in HCT recipients. Risk factors for LRTI within 90 days were analyzed using Cox regression among HCT recipients with rhinovirus URTI between January 2009 and March 2016. The final multivariable model included factors with a meaningful effect on the bootstrapped optimism corrected concordance statistic. Weighted score contributions based on hazard ratios were determined. Cumulative incidence curves estimated the probability of LRTI at various score cut-offs. Of 588 rhinovirus URTI events, 100 (17%) progressed to LRTI. In a final multivariable model allogeneic grafts, prior rhinovirus URTI, low lymphocyte count, low albumin, positive cytomegalovirus serostatus, recipient statin use, and steroid use ≥2 mg/kg/day were associated with progression to LRTI. A weighted risk score cut-off with the highest sensitivity and specificity was determined. Risk scores above this cut-off were associated with progression to LRTI (cumulative incidence 28% versus 11% below cut-off; P < .001). The weighted risk score for progression to rhinovirus LRTI can help identify and stratify patients for clinical management and for future clinical trials of therapeutics in HCT recipients.","Waghmare, Alpana; Xie, Hu; Kuypers, Jane; Sorror, Mohamed L.; Jerome, Keith R.; Englund, Janet A.; Boeckh, Michael; Leisenring, Wendy M.",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2018.12.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537551/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1083879118308048; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1083879118308048,383

This study aimed to characterise the respiratory bacterial microbiota of healthy children and to assess the impact of the changes associated with the development of persistent bacterial bronchitis. Blind, protected brushings were obtained from 20 healthy controls and 24 children with persistent bacterial bronchitis, with an additional directed sample obtained from persistent bacterial bronchitis patients. DNA was extracted, quantified using a 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR assay prior to microbial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. No significant difference in bacterial diversity or community composition (R2 = 0.01, P = 0.36) was observed between paired blind and non-blind brushes, showing that blind brushings are a valid means of accessing the airway microbiota. This has important implications for collecting lower respiratory samples from healthy children. A significant decrease in bacterial diversity (P < 0.001) and change in community composition (R2 = 0.08, P = 0.004) was observed between controls and patients. Bacterial communities within patients with PBB were dominated by Proteobacteria, and indicator species analysis showed that Haemophilus and Neisseria were significantly associated with the patient group. In 15 (52.9%) cases the dominant organism by sequencing was not identified by standard routine clinical culture. The bacteria present in the lungs of patients with persistent bacterial bronchitis were less diverse in terms of richness and evenness. The results validate the clinical diagnosis, and suggest that more attention to bacterial communities in children with chronic cough may lead to more rapid recognition of this condition with earlier treatment and reduction in disease burden.","Cuthbertson, Leah; Craven, Vanessa; Bingle, Lynne; Cookson, William O.C.M.; Everard, Mark L.; Moffatt, Miriam F.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/181982,383

Specialized proresolving mediators are endogenous agonists for the resolution of lung inflammation and injury in health, yet their association with acute respiratory distress syndrome severity and outcomes remains to be defined. In the current study, we investigate associations between plasma levels of specialized proresolving mediators and acute respiratory distress syndrome severity and mortality. DESIGN: Translational pilot study nested within a large prospective cohort of patients with risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome. SETTING: ICU from a large medical center. PATIENTS: Twenty-six Caucasian patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and available plasma from early in critical illness. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Here, in samples from 26 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, we examined plasma levels of select specialized proresolving mediators that promote lung injury resolution in preclinical systems, namely lipoxin A(4) and maresin 1, and select prophlogistic lipid mediators linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome pathogenesis, namely cysteinyl leukotrienes and thromboxane B(2). These mediators were detected by sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: lipoxin A(4) (assay range) (8.2–5,000 pg/mL), maresin 1 (7.8–1,000 pg/mL), cysteinyl leukotrienes (7.8–1,000 pg/mL), and thromboxane B(2) (15.6–2,000 pg/mL). Lower plasma levels of specialized proresolving mediators were associated with increased duration of ventilatory support and ICU length of stay. Even in this small sample size, trends were evident for increased cysteinyl leukotrienes to specialized proresolving mediator ratios (cysteinyl leukotrienes/maresin 1 and cysteinyl leukotrienes/lipoxin A(4)) in acute respiratory distress syndrome nonsurvivors. CONCLUSIONS: Lower specialized proresolving mediator levels in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients may disrupt timely resolution of lung inflammation and/or injury and contribute to clinical severity and mortality.","Tejera, Paula; Abdulnour, Raja-Elie E.; Zhu, Zhaozhong; Su, Li; Levy, Bruce D.; Christiani, David C.",Crit Care Explor,https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134939/,383

Thus, it is important to identify risk factors at an early stage for predicting deterioration that require transferring the patients to ICU. A retrospective multicenter study was conducted on COVID-19 patients admitted to designated hospitals in China from Jan 17, 2020, to Feb 17, 2020. Clinical presentation, laboratory data, and quantitative CT parameters were also collected. The result showed that increasing risks of ICU admission were associated with age > 60 years (odds ratio [OR], 12.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.42–24.61; P = 0.032), coexisting conditions (OR, 5.55; 95% CI, 1.59–19.38; P = 0.007) and CT derived total opacity percentage (TOP) (OR, 8.0; 95% CI, 1.45–39.29; P = 0.016).

616142,Does COVID-19 pneumonia signify secondary organizing pneumonia?: A narrative review comparing the similarities between these two distinct entities,2021-05-29,"BACKGROUND: Several countries have introduced maternal immunisation with pertussis vaccine to provide protection against pertussis in early infancy. There is increasing interest in non-specific effects of vaccines including that non-live vaccines may enhance susceptibility to non-targeted infections in females. Some studies have shown increased risk of chorioamnionitis among women receiving pertussis vaccine during pregnancy. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of maternal pertussis immunisation on the risk of chorioamnionitis, as well as the secondary outcomes of non-pertussis infections in women, non-pertussis infections in infants, spontaneous abortion or stillbirth, maternal death and infant death. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for articles published until January 14, 2021. We screened articles for eligibility and extracted data using Covidence. Quality was assessed using Cochrane RoB tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were imported into RevMan for pooling and conduction of a meta-analysis stratified by study type. Outcomes are presented as risk ratios. RESULTS: We identified 13 observational studies and six randomized controlled trials eligible for inclusion. We pooled data on chorioamnionitis from six observational studies and found maternal pertussis vaccine (mostly compared with other maternal immunizations with non-live vaccines) to be associated with an increased risk among the pertussis vaccinated women, RR = 1.27 [CI 95%: 1.14-1.42]. We found no difference in the analysis of our secondary outcomes of non-pertussis infections, spontaneous abortion or stillbirth and death. CONCLUSION: We found an increased risk of chorioamnionitis among women who received pertussis vaccine in pregnancy. The large number of women receiving pertussis vaccine during pregnancy, as well as the growing evidence of non-live vaccines causing increased susceptibility to infections, indicates a need for further randomised trials to assess potential adverse effects of maternal immunisation with pertussis-containing vaccines.","Andersen, A R; Kolmos, S K; Flanagan, K L; Benn, C S",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.02.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33642162/,383

As of March 12, 2020, a total number of 7,869 cases and 66 deaths had been documented in South Korea. Although the first confirmed case in South Korea was identified on January 20, 2020, the number of confirmed cases showed a rapid growth on February 19, 2020 with a total number of 1,261 cases with 12 deaths based on the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Method Using the data of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea that are publicly available from the KCDC, this paper aims to create spatial visualizations of COVID-19 transmission between January 20, 2020 and February 19, 2020. Results Using spatial visualization, this paper identified two early transmission clusters in South Korea (Daegu cluster and capital area cluster). Using a degree-weighted centrality measure, this paper proposes potential super-spreaders of the virus in the visualized clusters. Conclusion Compared to various epidemiological measures such as the basic reproduction number, spatial visualizations of the cluster-specific transmission networks and the proposed centrality measure may be more useful to characterize super-spreaders and the spread of the virus especially in the early epidemic phase.","Park, James Yeongjun",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.18.20038638,383

COVID-19 has been associated with increased rates of both venous and arterial thromboembolic events, a source of significant morbidity and mortality in this disease. Further evidence suggests a link between the inflammatory response and coagulopathy associated with COVID-19. This presents a unique set of challenges for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of thrombotic complications. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current literature on laboratory coagulation disruptions associated with COVID-19 and the clinical effects of thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), peripheral arterial thrombosis, and acute ischemic stroke in COVID-19. Endothelial injury and augmented innate immune response are implicated in the development of diffuse macro- and microvascular thrombosis in COVID-19. The pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy is an important determinant of appropriate treatment and monitoring of these complications. We highlight the importance of diagnosis and management of dysregulated coagulation in COVID-19 in order to improve outcomes in COVID-19 patients with thromboembolic complications.","Goswami, Julie; MacArthur, Taleen A.; Sridharan, Meera; Pruthi, Rajiv K.; McBane, Robert D.; Witzig, Thomas E.; Park, Myung S.",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000001680; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33378321/,383

Most are managed in primary care by their family physicians (FP). This study aimed to understand the perspectives of specialist and trainee FPs about their role in palliative care. Methods: we conducted a double focus-group study consisting of two separate online focus-groups, one with FP specialists (n = 9) and one with FP trainees (n = 10). Results: FPs already gather two fundamental skills for the provision of palliative care: the capacity to identify patients’ needs beyond physical symptoms and the recognition that the patient belongs to a familiar, psychosocial, and even spiritual environment. They perceive their role in palliative care to be four-fold: early identification of patients with palliative care needs, initial treatment, symptom management, and patient advocacy. Participants recognized the need for palliative care training and provided suggestions for training programs. Conclusion: FPs share a holistic approach and identify multiple roles they can play in palliative care, from screening to care and advocacy. Organizational barriers must be addressed. Short training programs that combine theory, practice, and experiential learning may further the potential for FPs to contribute to palliative care.","Cardoso, Carlos Seiça; Prazeres, Filipe; Xavier, Beatriz; Gomes, Bárbara",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299732/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147282,383

Research into how the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus together with its individual constituent genes and proteins interact with target host cells can facilitate the development of improved strategies to manage the acute and long-term complications of COVID-19. In this study, to better understand the biological roles of critical SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we determined and compared the host transcriptomic responses of the HL-CZ human pro-monocytic cell line upon transfection with key viral genes encoding the spike S1 subunit, S2 subunit, nucleocapsid protein (NP), NSP15 (endoribonuclease), and NSP16 (2′-O-ribose-methyltransferase). RNA sequencing followed by gene set enrichment analysis and other bioinformatics tools revealed that host genes associated with topologically incorrect protein, virus receptor activity, heat shock protein binding, endoplasmic reticulum stress, antigen processing and presentation were up-regulated in the presence of viral spike S1 expression. With spike S2 expression, pro-monocytic genes associated with the interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway, regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, adipocytokine signaling pathway, and insulin signaling pathway were down-regulated, whereas those associated with cytokine-mediated signaling were up-regulated. The expression of NSP15 induced the up-regulation of genes associated with neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil-mediated immunity, oxidative phosphorylation, prion disease, and pathways of neurodegeneration. The expression of NSP16 resulted in the down-regulation of genes associated with S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase activity. The expression of NP down-regulated genes associated with positive regulation of neurogenesis, nervous system development, and heart development. Taken together, the complex transcriptomic alterations arising from these viral-host gene interactions offer useful insights into host genes and their pathways that potentially contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.","Sharma, Anshika; Ong, Joe W.; Loke, Mun Fai; Chua, Eng Guan; Lee, Joseph J.; Choi, Hyung Won; Tan, Yee Joo; Lal, Sunil K.; Chow, Vincent T.",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34073047/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9061193,383

619194,Lung Ultrasound for Evaluation of COVID-19 in Children,2020-11-07,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is characterized by macrophage and neutrophil leukocyte recruitment and activation in the liver. Damage‐ and pathogen‐associated molecular patterns contribute to a self‐perpetuating proinflammatory state in ALD. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM‐1) is a surface receptor that amplifies inflammation induced by toll‐like receptors (TLRs) and is expressed on neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. We hypothesized that TREM‐1 signaling contributes to proinflammatory pathway activation in ALD. Using an in vivo ALD model in mice, we tested the effects of ligand‐independent TREM‐1 inhibitory peptides that were formulated into human high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)‐mimicking complexes GF9‐HDL and GA/E31‐HDL. As revealed in vitro, macrophages endocytosed these rationally designed complexes through scavenger receptors. A 5‐week alcohol feeding with the Lieber‐DeCarli diet in mice resulted in increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver steatosis, and increased proinflammatory cytokines in the liver. TREM‐1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was significantly increased in alcohol‐fed mice, and TREM‐1 inhibitors significantly reduced this increase. TREM‐1 inhibition significantly attenuated alcohol‐induced spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) activation, an early event in both TLR4 and TREM‐1 signaling. The TREM‐1 inhibitors significantly inhibited macrophage (epidermal growth factor‐like module‐containing mucin‐like hormone receptor‐like 1 [F4/80], clusters of differentiation [CD]68) and neutrophil (lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus G [Ly6G] and myeloperoxidase [MPO]) markers and proinflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP‐1], tumor necrosis factor α [TNF‐α], interleukin‐1β [IL‐1β], macrophage inflammatory protein 1α [MIP‐1α]) at the mRNA level compared to the HDL vehicle. Administration of TREM‐1 inhibitors ameliorated liver steatosis and early fibrosis markers (α‐smooth muscle actin [αSMA] and procollagen1α [Pro‐Col1α]) at the mRNA level in alcohol‐fed mice. However, the HDL vehicle also reduced serum ALT and some cytokine protein levels in alcohol‐fed mice, indicating HDL‐related effects. Conclusion: HDL‐delivered novel TREM‐1 peptide inhibitors ameliorate early phases of inflammation and neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and activation in the liver and attenuate hepatocyte damage and liver steatosis. TREM‐1 inhibition represents a promising therapeutic approach for further investigations in ALD.","Tornai, David; Furi, Istvan; Shen, Zu T.; Sigalov, Alexander B.; Coban, Sahin; Szabo, Gyongyi",Hepatol Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619998/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hep4.1269,383

Influenza surveillance systems are widely used around the world and play an important role in influenza epidemic prevention and control. METHODS: As a theater centers for disease prevention and control, we established an influenza monitoring platform (IMP) in 2014 to strengthen the monitoring of influenza-like illness and influenza virus infection. In this study, we introduced the constitution, influenza virus detection, and quality control for an IMP. The monitoring effect was also evaluated by comparing the monitoring data with data from national influenza surveillance systems. The experiences and problems associated with the platform also were summarized. RESULTS: A theater IMP was established based on 3 levels of medical units, including monitoring sites, testing laboratories and a checking laboratory. A series of measures were taken to guarantee the quality of monitoring, such as technical training, a unified process, sufficient supervision and timely communication. The platform has run smoothly for 3 monitoring years to date. In the 2014–2015 and 2016–2017 monitoring years, sample amount coincided with that obtained from the National Influenza Surveillance program. In the 2015–2016 monitoring year, due to the strict prevention and control measures, an influenza epidemic peak was avoided in monitoring units, and the monitoring data did not coincide with that of the National Influenza Surveillance program. Several problems, including insufficient attention, unreasonable administrative intervention or subordination relationships, and the necessity of detection in monitoring sites were still observed. CONCLUSIONS: A theater IMP was established rationally and played a deserved role in the prevention and control of influenza.

The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is now undergoing extensive scrutiny to understand the routes of transmission and sensitivity in different species. Here, we utilized a unique dataset of ACE2 sequences from 410 vertebrate species, including 252 mammals, to study the conservation of ACE2 and its potential to be used as a receptor by SARS-CoV-2. We designed a five-category binding score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories and only catarrhine primates into the very high category, suggesting that they are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed a protein structural analysis to qualitatively assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and found the number of predicted unfavorable changes significantly correlated with the binding score. Extending this analysis to human population data, we found only rare (frequency <0.001) variants in 10/25 binding sites. In addition, we found significant signals of selection and accelerated evolution in the ACE2 coding sequence across all mammals, and specific to the bat lineage. Our results, if confirmed by additional experimental data, may lead to the identification of intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2, guide the selection of animal models of COVID-19, and assist the conservation of animals both in native habitats and in human care.","Damas, Joana; Hughes, Graham M.; Keough, Kathleen C.; Painter, Corrie A.; Persky, Nicole S.; Corbo, Marco; Hiller, Michael; Koepfli, Klaus-Peter; Pfenning, Andreas R.; Zhao, Huabin; Genereux, Diane P.; Swofford, Ross; Pollard, Katherine S.; Ryder, Oliver A.; Nweeia, Martin T.; Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin; Teeling, Emma C.; Karlsson, Elinor K.; Lewin, Harris A.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2010146117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32826334/,383

620284,Development of a Surgical Workforce Access Team (SWAT) in the Battle Against COVID-19,2020-04-30,"We examined 169 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and found that they can be classified into two major genotypes, Type I and Type II. Type I can be further divided into Type IA and IB. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that the Type IA resembles the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 most. Type II was likely evolved from Type I and predominant in the infections. Our results suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a super-spreader. The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred somewhere else, because the patients had no direct link to the market. Furthermore, by analyzing three genomic sites that distinguish Type I and Type II strains, we found that synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II strains are predominant, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I. These findings could be valuable for the current epidemic prevention and control.","Zhang, Liangsheng; Yang, Jian-Rong; Zhang, Zhenguo; Lin, Zhenguo",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953,383

The need for a multidisciplinary approach in rehabilitation for post-COVID-19 people.,2021-09-09,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which enter the host cells through the interaction between its receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the plasma membrane of host cell. Neutralizing antibodies and peptide binders of RBD can block viral infection, however, the concern of accessibility and affordability of viral infection inhibitors has been raised. Here, we report the identification of natural compounds as potential SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors using the molecular docking-based virtual screening coupled with bilayer interferometry (BLI). From a library of 1871 natural compounds, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), 20(R)-ginsenoside Rg3 (RRg3), 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 (SRg3), isobavachalcone (Ibvc), isochlorogenic A (IscA) and bakuchiol (Bkc) effectively inhibited pseudovirus entry at concentrations up to 100 μM. Among these compounds, four compounds, EGCG, Ibvc, salvianolic acid A (SalA), and isoliensinine (Isl), were effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effect and plaque formation in Vero E6 cells. The EGCG was further validated with no observable animal toxicity and certain antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus mutants (D614G, N501Y, N439K & Y453F). Interestingly, EGCG, Bkc and Ibvc bind to ACE2 receptor in BLI assay, suggesting a dual binding to RBD and ACE2. Current findings shed some insight into identifications and validations of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors from natural compounds.","Zhang, Dingqi; Hamdoun, Sami; Chen, Ruihong; Yang, Lijun; Ip, Chi Kio; Qu, Yuanqing; Li, Runfeng; Jiang, Haiming; Yang, Zifeng; Chung, Sookja Kim; Liu, Liang; Wong, Vincent Kam Wai",Pharmacol Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105820; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661821004047; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661821004047?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34403732/,383

Virus-like particles containing RSV fusion proteins (RSV F-VLPs) induce T-helper type 1 antibody responses and protection against RSV. Heterologous RSV F-VLP prime and formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) boost vaccination has been reported to be effective in providing protection without inflammatory disease. Here, we investigated whether the FcRγ-chain is important for immune protection by the heterologous F-VLP and FI-RSV vaccination using FcRγ-chain knockout (−/−) mice. RSV F-VLP-primed and FI-RSV-boosted FcRγ −/− mice displayed less protective efficacy, as shown by higher lung viral titers upon RSV challenge, compared to RSV F-VLP-primed and FI-RSV-boosted immunized wild-type mice. RSV F-VLP and FI-RSV immunization induced lower levels of neutralizing activity and interferon-γ-producing CD8 T-cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage cells of FcRγ −/− mice than in those of wild-type mice. In addition, FcRγ −/− mice displayed a trend of enhancing lung histopathology after RSV vaccination and infection.

623878,The peripheral lymphocyte count as a predictor of severe COVID-19 and the effect of treatment with ciclesonide,2020-07-03,"Zambia is a landlocked, lower-middle income country in southern Africa, with a population of 17 million (1). The first known cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Zambia occurred in a married couple who had traveled to France and were subject to port-of-entry surveillance and subsequent remote monitoring of travelers with a history of international travel for 14 days after arrival. They were identified as having suspected cases on March 18, 2020, and tested for COVID-19 after developing respiratory symptoms during the 14-day monitoring period. In March 2020, the Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI) defined a suspected case of COVID-19 as 1) an acute respiratory illness in a person with a history of international travel during the 14 days preceding symptom onset; or 2) acute respiratory illness in a person with a history of contact with a person with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the 14 days preceding symptom onset; or 3) severe acute respiratory illness requiring hospitalization; or 4) being a household or close contact of a patient with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This definition was adapted from World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance issued March 20, 2020, on global surveillance for COVID-19 (2) to also include asymptomatic contacts of persons with confirmed COVID-19. Persons with suspected COVID-19 were identified through various mechanisms, including port-of-entry surveillance, contact tracing, health care worker (HCW) testing, facility-based inpatient screening, community-based screening, and calls from the public into a national hotline administered by the Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit and ZNPHI. Port-of-entry surveillance included an arrival screen consisting of a temperature scan, report of symptoms during the preceding 14 days, and collection of a history of travel and contact with persons with confirmed COVID-19 in the 14 days before arrival in Zambia, followed by daily remote telephone monitoring for 14 days. Travelers were tested for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, if they were symptomatic upon arrival or developed symptoms during the 14-day monitoring period. Persons with suspected COVID-19 were tested as soon as possible after evaluation for respiratory symptoms or within 7 days of last known exposure (i.e., travel or contact with a confirmed case). All COVID-19 diagnoses were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid Detection Kit, Maccura) of nasopharyngeal specimens; all patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted into institutional isolation at the time of laboratory confirmation, which was generally within 36 hours. COVID-19 patients were deemed recovered and released from isolation after two consecutive PCR-negative test results ≥24 hours apart. A Ministry of Health memorandum was released on April 13, 2020, mandating testing in public facilities of 1) all persons admitted to medical and pediatric wards regardless of symptoms; 2) all patients being admitted to surgical and obstetric wards, regardless of symptoms; 3) any outpatient with fever, cough, or shortness of breath; and 4) any facility or community death in a person with respiratory symptoms, and 5) biweekly screening of all HCWs in isolation centers and health facilities where persons with COVID-19 had been evaluated.

The availability of information in pediatric intensive care (PICUs) remains limited. The purpose of this study is to characterize COVID-19 positive admissions (CPAs) in the United States and to determine factors that may impact those admissions. Materials and Methods This is a retrospective cohort study using data from the COVID-19 dashboard virtual pediatric system containing information regarding respiratory support and comorbidities for all CPAs between March and April 2020. The state level data contained 13 different factors from population density, comorbid conditions and social distancing score. The absolute CPAs count was converted to frequency using the state's population. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess the association between CPAs frequency and endpoints. Results A total of 205 CPAs were reported by 167 PICUs across 48 states. The estimated CPAs frequency was 2.8 per million children. A total of 3,235 tests were conducted with 6.3% positive tests. Children above 11 years of age comprised 69.7% of the total cohort and 35.1% had moderated or severe comorbidities. The median duration of a CPA was 4.9 days [1.25-12.00 days]. Out of the 1,132 total CPA days, 592 [52.2%] were for mechanical ventilation. The inpatient mortalities were 3 [1.4%]. Multivariate analyses demonstrated an association between CPA's with greater population density [beta-coefficient 0.01, p<0.01] and increased percent of children receiving the influenza vaccination [beta-coefficient 0.17, p=0.01]. Conclusions Inpatient mortality during PICU CPAs is relatively low at 1.4%. CPA frequency seems to be impacted by population density while characteristics of illness severity appear to be associated with ultraviolet index, temperature, and comorbidities such as Type 1 diabetes. These factors should be included in future studies using patient-level data.","Loomba, R. S.; Villarreal, E. G.; Farias, J. S.; Bronicki, R.

Using data from a cohort of cases and high-risk contacts, we reconstructed viral load at the time of contact and inferred the probability of infection. The effect of viral load was larger in household contacts than in non-household contacts, with a transmission probability as large as 48% when the viral load was greater than 10(10) copies per mL. The transmission probability peaked at symptom onset, with a mean probability of transmission of 29%, with large individual variations. The model also projects the effects of variants on disease transmission. Based on the current knowledge that viral load is increased by two- to eightfold with variants of concern and assuming no changes in the pattern of contacts across variants, the model predicts that larger viral load levels could lead to a relative increase in the probability of transmission of 24% to 58% in household contacts, and of 15% to 39% in non-household contacts.","Marc, Aurélien; Kerioui, Marion; Blanquart, François; Bertrand, Julie; Mitjà, Oriol; Corbacho-Monné, Marc; Marks, Michael; Guedj, Jeremie",eLife (Cambridge),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34569939/; https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.69302,383

To assess whether self-reported perceptions of COVID-19 and personal characteristics are associated with protective behaviors among general adults and to compare patterns in six different countries. METHODS: This cross-sectional study uses the secondary data collected through an online survey between 15 and 23 April 2020 across six countries (China, Italy, Japan, Korea, the UK, and the USA). A total of 5945 adults aged 18 years or older were eligible for our analysis. A logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of three recommended behaviors (wearing a mask, handwashing, and avoiding social gatherings). RESULTS: In most countries except for China, the participants who perceived wearing a mask as being extremely effective to curtail the pandemic were more likely to wear a mask (OR, 95%CI: Italy: 4.14, 2.08–8.02; Japan: 3.59, 1.75–7.30; Korea: 7.89, 1.91–31.63: UK: 9.23, 5.14–17.31; USA: 4.81, 2.61–8.92). Those who perceived that handwashing was extremely effective had higher ORs of this preventive behavior (OR, 95%CI: Italy: 16.39, 3.56–70.18; Japan: 12.24, 4.03–37.35; Korea: 12.41, 2.02–76.39; UK: 18.04, 2.60–152.78; USA: 10.56, 2.21–44.32). The participants who perceived avoiding social gathering as being extremely effective to curtail the pandemic were more likely to take this type of preventive behavior (OR, 95%CI: China: 3.79, 1.28–10.23; Korea: 6.18, 1.77–20.60; UK: 4.45, 1.63–11.63; USA: 4.34, 1.84–9.95). The associations between personal characteristics, living environment, psychological status, and preventive behaviors varied across different countries. Individuals who changed their behavior because of recommendations from doctors/public health officials were more likely to take preventive behaviors in many countries. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that higher perceived effectiveness may be a common factor to encourage preventive behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These results may provide a better understanding of the homogeneity and heterogeneity of factors related to preventive behaviors and improve public health policies in various countries and groups.

There is a plethora of evidence for neurological, cognitive, and emotional deficits in COVID-19 patients. Acute neurological symptoms like neuroinflammation, cognitive impairment, loss of smell, and brain stroke are common direct effects among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Work-associated stress, lockdowns, social distancing, and quarantine in response to contain SARS-CoV-2 have also affected the mental health of large populations, regardless of age. Public health emergencies have affected individuals and communities, resulting in emotional reactions and unhealthy behaviors. Although vaccines have been widely distributed and administered among large populations, vaccine hesitancy still exists and may be due to apprehension about vaccine efficacy, preliminary trials, and associated side effects. To support vulnerable people during times of a health emergency, the focus must be directed at the root cause of the problem. This review highlights the impact of COVID-19 on the CNS by outlining direct and indirect effects and factors contributing to the decline in people's mental health throughout the COVID-19 pandemic both during and after vaccine administration. Furthermore, we also discuss reasons for vaccine hesitancy and why some groups of people are deprived of vaccines. Finally, we touched upon the social determinants of mental health and their impact on disadvantaged populations during times of crisis which may help policymakers set up some action plans to mitigate the COVID-19 mental health turmoil during this ongoing pandemic.","Pandey, Kabita; Thurman, Michellie; Johnson, Samuel D.; Acharya, Arpan; Johnston, Morgan; Klug, Elizabeth A.; Olwenyi, Omalla A.; Rajaiah, Rajesh; Byrareddy, Siddappa N.",Brain Res Bull,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0361923021002604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34487856/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2021.08.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361923021002604?v=s5,383

The aim of this work is to provide a detailed description of the human respiratory mechanics in healthy and diseased conditions. The model used for this purpose employs some known constitutive functions of the main components of the respiratory system. We give a detailed mathematical description of these functions and subsequently derive additional key ones. We are interested not only in the main output such as airflow at the mouth or alveolar pressure and volume, but also in other quantities such as resistance and pressure drop across each element of the system and even recoil and compliance of the chest wall. Pathological conditions are simulated by altering the parameters of the constitutive functions. Results show that increased upper airway resistance induces airflow reduction with concomitant narrowing of volume and pressure ranges without affecting lung compliance. Instead, increased elastic recoil leads to low volumes and decreased lung compliance. The model could be used in the study of the interaction between respiratory and cardiovascular systems in pathophysiological conditions.","Marconi, Silvia; De Lazzari, Claudio",Math Comput Simul,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378475420301737?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matcom.2020.05.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32501364/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378475420301737,383

In this population-based study we aimed to identify factors associated with higher risk of COVID-19 and adverse outcome. METHODS: Data on all confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the period January 1 to May 31, 2020 were extracted from the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases. Data on cancer and treatment was available from the Cancer Registry of Norway, the Norwegian Patient Registry and the Norwegian Prescription Database. Deaths due to COVID-19 were extracted from the Cause of Death Registry. From the Norwegian Intensive Care and Pandemic Registry we retrieved data on admittance to hospital and intensive care. We determined rates of COVID-19 disease in cancer patients and the rest of the population. We also ran multivariate analyses adjusting for age and gender. RESULTS: A total of 8 410 patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Norway during the study period, of which 547 (6.5%) were cancer patients. Overall, we found similar age adjusted rates of COVID-19 in the population with cancer as in the population without cancer. Unadjusted analysis showed that patients having undergone major surgery within the past 3 months had an increased risk of COVID-19 while we did not find increased Odds Ratio (OR) related to other oncological treatment modalities. No patients treated with stem cell or bone marrow transplant were diagnosed with COVID-19. The fatality rate of COVID-19 among cancer patients was 0.10. This was similar to non-cancer patients, when adjusting for age and sex with OR (95% CI) for death= 0.99 (0.68–1.42). Patients with distant metastases had significantly increased OR of death due to COVID-19 disease of 9.31 (95% CI 2.60–33.34).

626895,COVID-19 and AF: What About the Long Game?,2021-09-20,"SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for Covid-19 pandemic. In the early phase of infection, the single-strand positive RNA genome is translated into non-structural proteins (NSP). One of the first proteins produced during viral infection, NSP1, binds to the host ribosome and blocks the mRNA entry channel. This triggers translation inhibition of cellular translation. In spite of the presence of NSP1 on the ribosome, viral translation proceeds however. The molecular mechanism of the so-called viral evasion to NSP1 inhibition remains elusive. Here, we confirm that viral translation is maintained in the presence of NSP1. The evasion to NSP1-inhibition is mediated by the cis-acting RNA hairpin SL1 in the 5’UTR of SARS-CoV-2. NSP1-evasion can be transferred on a reporter transcript by SL1 transplantation. The apical part of SL1 is only required for viral translation. We show that NSP1 remains bound on the ribosome during viral translation. We suggest that the interaction between NSP1 and SL1 frees the mRNA accommodation channel while maintaining NSP1 bound to the ribosome. Thus, NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper, shutting down host translation or fostering SARS-CoV-2 translation depending on the presence of the SL1 5’UTR hairpin. SL1 is also present and necessary for translation of sub-genomic RNAs in the late phase of the infectious program. Consequently, therapeutic strategies targeting SL1 should affect viral translation at early and late stages of infection. Therefore, SL1 might be seen as a genuine ‘Achille heel’ of the virus.","Tidu, Antonin; Janvier, Aurélie; Schaeffer, Laure; Sosnowski, Piotr; Kuhn, Lauriane; Hammann, Philippe; Westhof, Eric; Eriani, Gilbert; Martin, Franck",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.339515,383
627074,Fear of COVID-19 and its associations with perceived personal and family benefits and harms in Hong Kong,2021-03-23,"INTRODUCTION: The article presents a protocol of a cross-sectional study of mental health of pregnant women in relation to the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. The primary aim is to compare differences in anxiety and depression scores of pregnant women between countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary aim is to assess demographic, economic, and social aspects affecting maternal anxiety and depression scores among pregnant women worldwide in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we will be able to compare differences in perception of the different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic (social distancing, restrictions related to delivery) between countries and according to the epidemic status (number of infected patients, number of reported deaths). The comparisons will also be done according to the COVID-19 status of the participants. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: It is a web-based anonymous survey of pregnant women living in countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey is comprised of 3 sections: 1).. Questions related to general demography, pregnancy health history, mental health history, socioeconomic factors, as well as perception of fear, burden and restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic; 2).. General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire for anxiety assessment and; 3).. Patient Health Questionnaire–9 (PHQ-9) for depression assessment. Web-based recruitment for health research has proven to be cost-effective and efficient. At current times with the COVID-19 pandemic, limited resources and social distancing restrictions, performing a mental health study involving pregnant women on a large international scale cannot be safely conducted without involving social-media. The fears of pregnant women fall into 3 categories: the medical condition, the economic status and the organization of daily activity. The study has received approval of the medical ethics committee and has been registered on Clinicaltrials.gov. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and made public through all available media.","Kajdy, Anna; Feduniw, Stepan; Ajdacka, Urszula; Modzelewski, Jan; Baranowska, Barbara; Sys, Dorota; Pokropek, Artur; Pawlicka, Paulina; Kaźmierczak, Maria; Rabijewski, Michał; Jasiak, Hanna; Lewandowska, Roksana; Borowski, Dariusz; Kwiatkowski, Sebastian; Poon, Liona C.",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000021279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32791708/,383

Different mammals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2; however, few species examined so far develop robust clinical disease that mirrors severe human cases or allows testing of vaccines and drugs under conditions of severe disease. Here, we compare the susceptibilities of three dwarf hamster species (Phodopus spp.) to SARS-CoV-2 and introduce the Roborovski dwarf hamster (P. roborovskii) as a highly susceptible COVID-19 model with consistent and fulminant clinical signs. Particularly, only this species shows SARS-CoV-2-induced severe acute diffuse alveolar damage and hyaline microthrombi in the lungs, changes described in patients who succumbed to the infection, but not reproduced in any experimentally infected animal. Based on our findings, we propose the Roborovski dwarf hamster as a valuable model to examine the efficacy and safety of vaccine candidates and therapeutics, particularly for use in highly susceptible individuals.","Trimpert, Jakob; Vladimirova, Daria; Dietert, Kristina; Abdelgawad, Azza; Kunec, Dusan; Dökel, Simon; Voss, Anne; Gruber, Achim D.; Bertzbach, Luca D.; Osterrieder, Nikolaus",Cell Rep,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124720314777; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108488; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720314777?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33271063/,383

The purpose of this study was to test if the presence of tinnitus subgroups are discernible based on hearing-related comorbidities, and to identify predictors of tinnitus severity for each subgroup identified. METHODS: An exploratory cross-sectional study was used. The study was nested within an online survey distributed worldwide to investigate tinnitus experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main outcome measure was the tinnitus Handicap Inventory- Screening Version. RESULTS: From the 3400 respondents, 2980 were eligible adults with tinnitus with an average age of 58 years (SD = 14.7) and 49% (n = 1457) being female. A three-cluster solution identified distinct subgroups, namely, those with tinnitus-only (n = 1306; 44%), those presenting with tinnitus, hyperacusis, hearing loss and/or misophonia (n = 795; 27%), and those with tinnitus and hearing loss (n = 879; 29%). Those with tinnitus and hyperacusis reported the highest tinnitus severity (M = 20.3; SD = 10.5) and those with tinnitus and no hearing loss had the lowest tinnitus severity (M = 15.7; SD = 10.4). Younger age and the presence of mental health problems predicted greater tinnitus severity for all groups (ß &#8804; -0.1, P &#8804; .016). CONCLUSION: Further exploration of these potential subtypes are needed in both further research and clinical practice by initially triaging tinnitus patients prior to their clinical appointments based on the presence of hearing-related comorbidities. Unique management pathways and interventions could be tailored for each tinnitus subgroup.","Beukes, Eldré W; Baguley, David M; Manchaiah, Vinaya; Andersson, Gerhard; Allen, Peter M; Kaldo, Viktor; Jacquemin, Laure; Lourenco, Matheus P C G; Onozuka, Joy; Stockdale, David; Maidment, David W",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34331723/,383

We use daily new case counts of COVID-19 patients reported by local health administrations from different Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) within the US to parametrize a model that well describes the propagation of the disease in each area. We then introduce a time-varying control input that represents the level of social distancing imposed on the population of a given area and solve an optimal control problem with the goal of minimizing the impact of social distancing on the economy in the presence of relevant constraints, such as a desired level of suppression for the epidemics at a terminal time. We find that with the exception of the initial time and of the final time, the optimal control input is well approximated by a constant, specific to each area, which contrasts with the implemented system of reopening ‘in phases’. For all the areas considered, this optimal level corresponds to stricter social distancing than the level estimated from data. Proper selection of the time period for application of the control action optimally is important: depending on the particular MSA this period should be either short or long or intermediate. We also consider the case that the transmissibility increases in time (due e.g. to increasingly colder weather), for which we find that the optimal control solution yields progressively stricter measures of social distancing. We finally compute the optimal control solution for a model modified to incorporate the effects of vaccinations on the population and we see that depending on a number of factors, social distancing measures could be optimally reduced during the period over which vaccines are administered to the population.","Shirin, Afroza; Lin, Yen Ting; Sorrentino, Francesco",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33753777/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85496-9,383

The mode of transmission is believed principally to be airborne exposure to respiratory droplets from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients but there is also a risk of the droplets contaminating fomites such as touch surfaces including door handles, stair rails etc, leading to hand pick up and transfer to eyes, nose and mouth. We have previously shown that human coronavirus 229E survives for more than 5 days on inanimate surfaces and another laboratory reproduced this for SARS-CoV-2 this year. However, we showed rapid inactivation of Hu-CoV-229E within 10 minutes on different copper surfaces while the other laboratory indicated this took 4 hours for SARS-CoV-2. So why the difference? We have repeated our work with SARS-CoV-2 and can confirm that this coronavirus can be inactivated on copper surfaces in as little as 1 minute. We discuss why the 4 hour result may be technically flawed.","Bryant, Catherine; Wilks, Sandra A.; Keevil, C. William",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.02.424974,383

Travel behaviors are significantly influenced due to such measures. However, people have various travel needs ranging from grocery shopping to work. This study examines the changes that occurred in travel behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected through an online questionnaire survey that included questions on trip purpose, mode choice, distance traveled, and frequency of trips before and during COVID-19. 1,203 responses were collected from various countries around the world. Results explained that trip purpose, mode choice, distance traveled, and frequency of trips for the primary travel were significantly different before and during the pandemic. Further, the majority of trips were made for shopping during the pandemic. There was a significant shift from public transport to private transport and non-motorized modes. People placed a higher priority on the pandemic related concerns while choosing a mode during the pandemic as compared to the general concerns. Gender, car ownership, employment status, travel distance, the primary purpose of traveling, and pandemic-related underlying factors during COVID-19 were found to be significant predictors of mode choice during the pandemic. Outcomes of this study could be useful in transport planning and policymaking during pandemics based on the travel needs of people. In particular, government authorities could utilize such knowledge for planning smart and partial lockdowns.

630143,Management Strategies of Patients with Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic Era,2020-08-17,"There are many age-associated changes in the respiratory and pulmonary immune system. These changes include decreases in the volume of the thoracic cavity, reduced lung volumes, and alterations in the muscles that aid respiration. Muscle function on a cellular level in the aging population is less efficient. The elderly population has less pulmonary reserve, and cough strength is decreased in the elderly population due to anatomic changes and muscle atrophy. Clearance of particles from the lung through the mucociliary elevator is decreased and associated with ciliary dysfunction. Many complex changes in immunity with aging contribute to increased susceptibility to infections including a less robust immune response from both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Considering all of these age-related changes to the lungs, pulmonary disease has significant consequences for the aging population. Chronic lower respiratory tract disease is the third leading cause of death in people aged 65 years and older. With a large and growing aging population, it is critical to understand how the body changes with age and how this impacts the entire respiratory system. Understanding the aging process in the lung is necessary in order to provide optimal care to our aging population.

630869,COVID-19 pandemic: A review based on current evidence,2020-06-03,"Within the Dutch hegemonic discourse, the “migrant other” is portrayed as almost incompatible with “national culture” while it is simultaneously pressured to assimilate. This creates paradoxes for the queer refugee participants in this study. When these refugees assimilate, they risk reinforcing the dominant discourse considering their group as the “backward other”. When they do not assimilate, they are considered not “properly” Dutch. This paper explores how queer refugee artists can unsettle such dominant exclusionary discourses through exilic (art) narratives. Their experiences of exilic positioning (being neither there nor here) and queer liminality (e.g., nonbinary gender identifications) and their intersectional positionalities situate these artists in various “states of in-betweenness”. Although these states may be challenging, this paper shows how they can also stimulate agency. Inspired by a feminist approach, this study aimed to co-create knowledge with rather than about participants, focusing on creativity and resilience. Methods included biographical interviews and an arts-informed component in which participants were invited to create artistic works concerning their experiences during COVID-19 for an online platform. This study shows how the research participants challenge hegemonic discourses at various levels, using multiple modes of reflection and creation while engaging with their in-between situatedness. At the individual level, they challenge discourses by exploring (or performing) their non-conforming queer positioning through their art practices. At the communal level, plural reflexivity is triggered via art shared within and outside the community. At the societal level, queer refugees exercise activism creatively through images, songs or performances.","Holle, Fabian; Rast, Maria Charlotte; Ghorashi, Halleh",Front Sociol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.641630; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34041293/,383

AIMS: The aim was to compare three interactive examination designs, all based on active learning pedagogy, in terms of nursing students’ engagement and preparedness, their learning achievement, and instructional aspects. METHODS: A comparative research design was used including final-year undergraduate nursing students. All students were enrolled in a quality improvement course at a metropolitan university in Sweden. In this comparative study to evaluate three course layouts, participants (Cohort 1, n = 89; Cohort 2, n = 97; Cohort 3, n = 60) completed different examinations assessing the same course content and learning objectives, after which they evaluated the examinations on a questionnaire in numerical and free-text responses. Chi-squared tests were conducted to compare background variables between the cohorts and Kruskal–Wallis H tests to assess numerical differences in experiences between cohorts. Following the guidelines of the Good Reporting of a Mixed Methods Study (GRAMMS), a sequential mixed-methods analysis was performed on the quantitative findings, and the qualitative findings were used complementary to support the interpretation of the quantitative results. RESULTS: The 246 students who completed the questionnaire generally appreciated the interactive examination in active learning classrooms. Among significant differences in the results, Cohort 2 (e.g., conducted the examination on campus) scored highest for overall positive experience and engagement, whereas Cohort 3 (e.g., conducted the examination online) scored the lowest. Students in Cohort 3 generally commended the online examination’s chat function available for use during the examination.

Understanding and managing health-related concerns resulting from physical distancing measures are of utmost importance. Objectives: To describe and analyze the volume, content, and geospatial distribution of tweets associated with telehealth during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: We inquired Twitter public data to access tweets related to telehealth from March 30, 2020 to April 6, 2020. We analyzed tweets using natural language processing (NLP) and unsupervised learning methods. Clustering analysis was performed to classify tweets. Geographic tweet distribution was correlated with Covid-19 confirmed cases in the United States. All analyses were carried on the Google Cloud computing service “Google Colab” using Python libraries (Python Software Foundation). Results: A total of 41,329 tweets containing the term “telehealth” were retrieved. The most common terms appearing alongside ‘telehealth’ were “covid”, “health”, “care”, “services”, “patients”, and “pandemic”. Mental health was the most common health-related topic that appeared in our search reflecting a high need for mental healthcare during the pandemic. Similarly, Medicare was the most common appearing health plan mirroring the accelerated access to telehealth and change in coverage policies. The geographic distribution of tweets related to telehealth and having a specific location within the United States (n=19,367) was significantly associated with the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases reported in each state (p<0.001). Conclusion: Social media activity is an accurate reflection of disease burden during the Covid-19 pandemic.

They have been implemented globally during the pandemic, however, the specific NPIs implemented and the timing of interventions has varied widely. We validated two published datasets on the implementation of NPIs globally. The health and socioeconomic factors associated with delay in implementation of NPIs was analyzed using fractional logit and probit models, and beta regression models. The probability of timely NPI implementation by a country was analyzed using a probit model. The effects of these interventions on mobility changes using Google social mobility reports, were analyzed with propensity score matching methods. Three NPIs were analyzed: national school closure, national lockdown, and global travel ban. Countries with higher incomes, larger populations, and better health preparedness measures had greater delays in implementation. Countries with greater population density, more democratic political systems, lower case detection capacity, and later arrival of first cases were more likely to implement NPIs. Implementation of lockdowns significantly reduced physical mobility. Mobility was further reduced when lockdowns were enforced with curfews or fines, or were more strictly defined. National school closures did not significantly change mobility. The implementation of NPIs is a global public good during pandemics, and the international community needs to address constraints and design incentives so countries implement NPIs in a timely manner.

Informed by a scoping review, this discussion paper aims to identify the societal value elements of antibiotics and to provide guidance on how these value elements can be incorporated in economic evaluation. With a view to appropriately quantify the societal value of antibiotics, there is a need for good practice guidelines on the methodology of economic evaluation for such products. We argue that it is important to assess antibiotics at population level to account for their transmission, diversity, insurance, spectrum, novel action and enablement values. In addition to the value of antibiotics to infected patients, economic evaluations need to use modeling approaches to explore the impact of different modes of employing new and existing antibiotics (for example, as last resort treatment) on disease transmission and resistance development in current and future patients. Hence, assessing the value of antibiotics also involves an ethical dimension. Further work is required about how the multiple value elements of antibiotics are linked to each other and how they can be aggregated.","Simoens, Steven; Spriet, Isabel",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.618238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33597882/,383

As hospital systems run far over capacity, facing possible shortages of critical care medical resources and personal protective equipment as well as clinician deaths, the psychological stressors necessitate a strong well-being support model for staff. At the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York City, health care workers have been heroically providing frontline care to COVID-19 patients while facing their own appropriate fears for their personal safety in the setting of contagion. This moral obligation cannot be burdened by unacceptable risks; the health system’s full support is required to address the needs of its workforce. In this Invited Commentary, the authors describe how an MSHS Employee, Faculty, and Trainee Crisis Support Task Force—created in early March 2020 and composed of behavioral health, human resources, and well-being leaders from across the health system—used a rapid needs assessment model to capture the concerns of the workforce related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The task force identified 3 priority areas central to promoting and maintaining the well-being of the entire MSHS workforce during the pandemic: meeting basic daily needs; enhancing communications for delivery of current, reliable, and reassuring messages; and developing robust psychosocial and mental health support options. Using a work group strategy, the task force operationalized the rollout of support initiatives for each priority area. Attending to the emotional well-being of health care workers has emerged as a central element in the MSHS COVID-19 response, which continues to be committed to the physical and emotional needs of a workforce that courageously faces this crisis.","Ripp, Jonathan; Peccoralo, Lauren; Charney, Dennis",Acad Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32282344/; https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003414,383

Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational analysis using hospital electronic administrative data of all interfacility ED-to-ED transfers to a single, quaternary care adult ED from January 1, 2018 to September 30, 2020 in Middle, Tennessee. “Safer at Home” orders were issued March 23, 2020 in Davidson County, TN in response to the COVID-19 pandemic mandating citizens stay inside their homes unless engaged in “essential activities.” We defined the post-lockdown period as March 23, 2020 to September 30, 2020. We sought to identify transfers that may not require in-person evaluation and may be amenable to other modalities (eg, telehealth). Called “potentially avoidable transfers,” (PATs), they are defined as ED-to-ED interfacility transfers discharged from the ED or admitted to the hospital for <24 hours without a procedure. To operationalize this definition, we constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to examine whether this lockdown order was associated with higher odds of a transfer being a PAT. We adjusted for seasonality, time since start of the study, patient demographics including age (per 10 years), sex, race, arrival emergency severity index triage acuity, mode of arrival (helicopter vs. ground), timing of arrival (ie, business hours), clinical condition using AHRQ’s clinician condition software (CCS), and rurality. Results: During the study period there were 20,978 ED-to-ED transfers meeting eligibility criteria and, of those, 4,806 (23%) met PAT criteria. In the 7 months post-lockdown PATs were generally down trending when compared month-to-month across years. The first month post-lockdown saw a decrease in transfers and PATs (17% and 28%, respectively) but this was not sustained. In the multivariable model, there was a significant seasonal effect. After adjusting for seasonality, the lockdown was not associated with PATs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.2, 5.2). The following were associated with increased odds of being a PAT: lack of insurance and arrival during non-business hours. The following were less likely to be PATs: female sex, increasing age, specific diagnostic categories (digestive, infectious, and circulatory conditions), and arrival by nonambulance. Conclusions: In this single center study, there was no effect of the COVID-19 lockdown orders on PATs. However, after adjusting for covariates and seasonality, we did identify a considerable seasonal effect and an overall downward trend in PATs over time. These findings do not address the appropriateness of the transfer but whether in-person evaluation may be amenable to telehealth or other potential means. Generalizability of this single center study should be examined in other settings along with reasons for the potential downward trend.","Van Schaik, G.; Self, W.; Hennessy, C.; Ward, M.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064421006417; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064421006417; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.07.082,383
633451,P0181 Cancer care during COVID-19: Data from 157 patient organisations,2021-06-30,"BACKGROUND: Governments commonly fund research with specific applications in mind. Such mechanisms may facilitate ‘research translation’ but funders may employ strategies that can also undermine the integrity of both science and government. We estimated the prevalence and investigated correlates of funder efforts to suppress health behaviour intervention trial findings. METHODS: Our sampling frame was lead or corresponding authors of papers (published 2007–2017) included in a Cochrane review, reporting findings from trials of interventions to improve nutrition, physical activity, sexual health, smoking, and substance use. Suppression events were based on a previous survey of public health academics. Participants answered questions concerning seven suppression events in their efforts to report the trial, e.g., [I was…] “asked to suppress certain findings as they were viewed as being unfavourable.” We also examined the association between information on study funder, geographical location, targeted health behaviour, country democracy rating and age of publication with reported suppression. FINDINGS: We received responses from 104 authors (50%) of 208 eligible trials, from North America (34%), Europe (33%), Oceania (17%), and other countries (16%). Eighteen percent reported at least one of the seven suppression events relating to the trial in question. The most commonly reported suppression event was funder(s) expressing reluctance to publish because they considered the results ‘unfavourable’ (9% reported). We found no strong associations with the subject of research, funding source, democracy, region, or year of publication. CONCLUSIONS: One in five researchers in this global sample reported being pressured to delay, alter, or not publish the findings of health behaviour intervention trials. Regulation of funder and university practices, establishing study registries, and compulsory disclosure of funding conditions in scientific journals, are needed to protect the integrity of public-good research.","McCrabb, Sam; Mooney, Kaitlin; Wolfenden, Luke; Gonzalez, Sharleen; Ditton, Elizabeth; Yoong, Serene; Kypri, Kypros",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407104/,383

In this scenario, a support during pronation by the ICU Physiotherapy Team was introduced. Research methodology: Retrospective analysis. Consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients. Setting: A COVID-19 Center in southern Switzerland, between March 16th and April 30th, 2020. Main Outcome Measures: Rates and characteristics of pronation-related complications. Results: Forty-two patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) were treated; 296 standard prone/supine positioning were performed, with 3.52 cycles/patient. One (0.3%) major complication was observed, while fourteen (33.3%) patients developed minor complications, e.g. pressure injuries. The incidence of pressure sores was related to ICU length-of-stay (LOS) (p = 0.029) and MV days (p = 0.015), while their number (n = 27) further correlated with ICU LOS (p = 0.001) and MV days (p = 0.001). The propensity matching score analysis did not show any protective factor of pronation regarding pressure injuries (p = 0.448). No other significant correlation was found. Conclusion: The specific pronation team determined a low rate of major complications in critically ill COVID19 patients. The high rate of minor complications appeared to be related to disease severity, rather than from pronation.","Glotta, A.; Faldarini, N.; Biggiogero, M.; Saporito, A.; Olivieri, D.; Molteni, C.; Petazzi, S.; Mauri, R.; Capdevila, X.; Ceruti, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.20.21258949v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.20.21258949,383

The background information of previously immune fraction among refugees cannot be explicitly estimated, and thus we conducted an uncertainty analysis of the basic reproduction number, R(0). METHODS: A renewal process model was devised to estimate the R(0) and ascertainment rate of cases, and loss of susceptible individuals was modeled as one minus the sum of initially immune fraction and the fraction naturally infected during the epidemic. To account for the uncertainty of initially immune fraction, we employed a Latin Hypercube sampling (LHS) method. RESULTS: R(0) ranged from 4.7 to 14.8 with the median estimate at 7.2. R(0) was positively correlated with ascertainment rates. Sensitivity analysis indicated that R(0) would become smaller with greater variance of the generation time. DISCUSSION: Estimated R(0) was broadly consistent with published estimate from endemic data, indicating that the vaccination coverage of 86% has to be satisfied to prevent the epidemic by means of mass vaccination. LHS was particularly useful in the setting of a refugee camp in which the background health status is poorly quantified.","Matsuyama, Ryota; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.; Endo, Akira; Lee, Hyojung; Yamaguchi, Takayuki; Tsuzuki, Shinya; Nishiura, Hiroshi",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29629244/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4583,383

Viruses reviewed include influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and coronavirus. Diagnosis is by nucleic acid testing due to improved sensitivity, specificity, broad range of detection of viral pathogens, automatization, and turnaround time. Respiratory viral infections may be associated with acute rejection and chronic lung allograft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients. The cornerstone of influenza prevention is annual vaccination and in some cases antiviral prophylaxis. Treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors and other antivirals is reviewed. Prevention of RSV is limited to prophylaxis with palivizumab in select children. Therapy of RSV upper or lower tract disease is controversial but may include oral or aerosolized ribavirin in some populations. There are no approved vaccines or licensed antivirals for parainfluenza, rhinovirus, hMPV, and coronavirus. Potential management strategies for these viruses are given. Future studies should include prospective trials using contemporary molecular diagnostics to understand the true epidemiology, clinical spectrum, and long‐term consequences of respiratory viruses as well as to define preventative and therapeutic measures.","Manuel, Oriol; Estabrook, Michele",Clin Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30817023/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.13511,383
635583,Double COVID-19 Confirmed Case Fatality Rate in Countries with High Elderly Female Vitamin D Deficiency Prevalence,2020-06-16,"BACKGROUND: Prognostic biomarkers are needed to identify patients at high-risk for severe COVID-19. Galectin-3 is known to drive neutrophil infiltration and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines contributing to airway inflammation. METHODS: In this prospective cohort, we assessed galectin-3 levels in 156 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were diagnosed as either critical (>50% lung damage) or moderate (<50% of lung damage) based on computerized tomography. Patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and/or died during hospitalization were categorized as having a severe outcome, and non-severe outcome if they were discharged and none of the former occurred. RESULTS: Elevated serum galectin-3 was significantly higher in critical patients compared to moderate ones (35.91 {+/-} 19.37 ng/mL vs. 25 {+/-} 14.85 ng/mL, p<0.0001). Patients who progressed to a severe outcome including IMV and/or in-hospital death, presented higher galectin-3 levels (41.17 ng/mL [IQR 29.71 - 52.25] vs. 23.76 ng/mL [IQR 15.78 - 33.97] compared to those of a non-severe outcome, p<0.0001). Galectin-3 discriminated well between those with severe and non-severe outcome, with an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 - 0.84, p<0.0001)and was found to be an independent predictor of severe outcome regardless of the percentage of lung involvement. Additionally, the combination of galectin-3, CRP and albumin, significantly improved its individual predicting ability with an AUC 0.84 (95% CI 0.77 - 0.91, p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Circulating galectin-3 levels can be used to predict severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients, including the requirement of mechanical ventilation and/or death, regardless of the initial severity of the disease.","Cervantes-Alvarez, E.; Limon-de la Rosa, N.; Salgado-de la Mora, M.; Valdez-Sandoval, P.; Palacios-Jimenez, M.; Rodriguez-Alvarez, F.; Vera-Maldonado, B.

METHODS: An online survey was administered to all Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology members in October, 2020 to assess PPE availability and crisis standards utilized in fall, 2020. RESULTS: In total, 1,081 infection preventionists (IP) participated. A quarter lacked sufficient disinfection supplies, N95s, isolation gowns, and gloves; 10 – 20% lacked eye protection and hand hygiene supplies. Significantly more were reusing respirators than masks (65.6% vs 46.8%, respectively; p< .001); a third (32.0%, n=735) were re-using isolation gowns. About half (45.9%, n=496) were decontaminating respirators. Determinants of believing current PPE re-use protocols were safe and evidence-based included the IP being involved in developing COVID-19 protocols (both), having respirator reuse protocols that involve ≤ five reuses (both), using reusable respiratory protection (both), decontaminating respirators (perceived safe), and not reusing masks (perceived safe; p < .05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Although most healthcare facilities had adequate PPE in fall 2020, PPE supply chains were still disrupted, resulting in the need to reuse or decontaminate PPE.

637916,The Long-Term Impact of COVID-19 Pneumonia on the Pulmonary Function of Survivors,2021-07-09,"Rationale: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic, in which obesity, hypertension, and diabetes have been linked to poor outcomes. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with these conditions and may influence the prognosis of adults with COVID-19. Objectives: To determine the effect of OSA on clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Methods: The current prospective observational study was conducted in three hospitals in Istanbul, Turkey from March 10 to June 22, 2020. The participants were categorized as high-risk or low-risk OSA according to the Berlin questionnaire that was administered in the out-patient clinic, in hospital, or shortly after discharge from hospital blinded to the clinical outcomes. A modified high-risk (mHR)–OSA score based on the snoring patterns (intensity and/or frequency), breathing pauses, and morning/daytime sleepiness, without taking obesity and hypertension into account, were used in the regression models. Results: The primary outcome was the clinical improvement defined as a decline of two categories from admission on a 7-category ordinal scale that ranges from 1 (discharged with normal activity) to 7 (death) on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28, respectively. Secondary outcomes included clinical worsening (an increase of 1 category), need for hospitalization, supplemental oxygen, and intensive care. In total, 320 eligible patients (median [interquartile range] age, 53.2 [41.3–63.0] yr; 45.9% female) were enrolled. In all, 121 (37.8%) were categorized as known (n = 3) or high-risk OSA (n = 118). According to the modified scoring, 70 (21.9%) had mHR-OSA. Among 242 patients requiring hospitalization, clinical improvement within 2 weeks occurred in 75.4% of the mHR-OSA group compared with 88.4% of the modified low-risk–OSA group (P = 0.014). In multivariate regression analyses, mHR-OSA (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19–0.92) and male sex (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17–0.86) predicted the delayed clinical improvement. In the entire study population (n = 320), including the nonhospitalized patients, mHR-OSA was associated with clinical worsening (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.00–2.39) and with the need for supplemental oxygen (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.06–3.59). Snoring patterns, especially louder snoring, significantly predicted delayed clinical improvement, worsening, need for hospitalization, supplemental oxygen, and intensive care. Conclusions: Adults with mHR-OSA in our COVID-19 cohort had poorer clinical outcomes than those with modified low-risk OSA independent of age, sex, and comorbidities.

Nurses on the frontlines are particularly vulnerable to the adversity of working under these conditions, particularly with regard to mental health. Thus, understanding risk and protective factors for this vulnerable and essential group is critical for identifying potential targets of interventions. We had two aims for the current study: (a) to examine work functioning and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress (PTSD) among nurses who did and did not care for patients with COVID-19; and (b) to determine if resilience and social support moderate these relationships. METHODS: For three weeks in July 2020, nurses across the United States were invited to participate in an online survey collecting data on demographics, resilience, social support, and screening measures of depression, PTSD, anxiety, and distracted practice. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression for each outcome measure. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a growing body of research reporting that nurses are experiencing mental health sequelae during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially those providing direct care to patients with the virus. We found that compared to nurses who did not care for patients with COVID-19, those who did reported increased symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. A novel contribution is our finding that nurses providing direct COVID-19 care also experienced increased levels of distracted practice, a behavioral measure of distraction linking to a potential impact on patient care. We also found that resilience and social support acted as moderators of some of these relationships. Fostering resilience and social support may help buffer the effects of providing care to patients with COVID-19 and could potentially decrease nurse vulnerability to developing psychological symptoms and impairment on the job.","Schierberl Scherr, Anna E.; Ayotte, Brian J.; Kellogg, Marni B.",SAGE Open Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1177/23779608211024213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189262/,383

Soluble decoy receptors, in which the ACE2 ectodomain is engineered to block S with high affinity, potently neutralize infection and, due to close similarity with the natural receptor, hold out the promise of being broadly active against virus variants without opportunity for escape. Here, we directly test this hypothesis. We find an engineered decoy receptor, sACE2(2).v2.4, tightly binds S of SARS-associated viruses from humans and bats, despite the ACE2-binding surface being a region of high diversity. Saturation mutagenesis of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) followed by in vitro selection, with wild type ACE2 and the engineered decoy competing for binding sites, failed to find S mutants that discriminate in favor of the wild type receptor. Variant N501Y in the RBD, which has emerged in a rapidly spreading lineage (B.1.1.7) in England, enhances affinity for wild type ACE2 20-fold but remains tightly bound to engineered sACE22.v2.4. We conclude that resistance to engineered decoys will be rare and that decoys may be active against future outbreaks of SARS-associated betacoronaviruses.","Chan, Kui K.; Tan, Timothy J.C.; Narayanan, Krishna K.; Procko, Erik",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398275/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.18.344622,383

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study consisted of 325 patients whose COVID-19 was confirmed by RT-PCR test and who underwent chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) studies to assess parenchymal disease severity. Only 195 cases included in the final analysis after exclusion of cases with previous chest disease and cases having more than 24 hours interval between their X-ray and CT chest studies. Both chest X-ray and CT severity scores (CT-SS) were recorded by 2 experienced radiologists and were compared to the clinical severity. Interobserver agreement was assessed for CX-SS and CT-SS. RESULTS: In relation to the clinical severity, the sensitivity of the CX-SS for diagnosis of moderate to severe parenchymal disease was high (90.4% and 100%) and low for mild cases (66.2%), while the specificity was high for mild to moderate parenchymal disease (100%) compared to severe cases (86.7%). The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of the CT-SS were higher than CX-SS. Pearson correlation coefficient demonstrated a strong positive correlation between CX-SS and CT-SS (rs = 0.88, p < 0.001). The inter-observer agreement for CX-SS was good (k = 0.79, p = 0.001), and it was excellent for CT-SS (k = 0.85, p = 0.001).

Little is known about the public awareness toward the nature or prevention of the disease. The aim of this work was to assess the knowledge of the adult population in Riyadh toward the MERS-CoV. In this cross-sectional survey, a self-administrated questionnaire was distributed to randomly selected participants visiting malls in Riyadh. The questionnaire contained measurable epidemiological and clinical MERS-CoV knowledge level variables and relevant source of information. The study included 676 participants. Mean age was 32.5 (±SD 8.6) years and 353 (47.8%) were males. Almost all participants heard about the corona disease and causative agent. The study showed a fair overall knowledge (66.0%), less knowledge on epidemiological features of the disease (58.3%), and good knowledge (90.7%) on the clinical manifestation of the MERS-CoV. Internet was the major (89.0%) source of disease information, and other sources including health care providers, SMS, television, magazines and books were low rated (all <25%).

Recommendations on the management of acute appendicitis have been based on expert opinion, but very little evidence is available. This study addressed that dearth with a snapshot of worldwide approaches to appendicitis. METHODS: The Association of Italian Surgeons in Europe designed an online survey to assess the current attitude of surgeons globally regarding the management of patients with acute appendicitis during the pandemic. Questions were divided into baseline information, hospital organization and screening, personal protective equipment, management and surgical approach, and patient presentation before versus during the pandemic. RESULTS: Of 744 answers, 709 (from 66 countries) were complete and were included in the analysis. Most hospitals were treating both patients with and those without COVID. There was variation in screening indications and modality used, with chest X‐ray plus molecular testing (PCR) being the commonest (19·8 per cent). Conservative management of complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis was used by 6·6 and 2·4 per cent respectively before, but 23·7 and 5·3 per cent, during the pandemic (both P < 0·001). One‐third changed their approach from laparoscopic to open surgery owing to the popular (but evidence‐lacking) advice from expert groups during the initial phase of the pandemic. No agreement on how to filter surgical smoke plume during laparoscopy was identified. There was an overall reduction in the number of patients admitted with appendicitis and one‐third felt that patients who did present had more severe appendicitis than they usually observe.

Adequately trained public health personnel protect and promote health, avert health disparities, and allow rapid response to health emergencies. Evaluations of the healthcare workforce typically focus on physicians and nurses in curative medical venues. Few have evaluated public health workforce capacity building or sought to identify gaps between the academic training of public health employees and the needs of the healthcare organizations in which they are employed. This project report describes the conceptual framework of “Sharing European Educational Experience in Public Health for Israel (SEEEPHI): harmonization, employability, leadership, and outreach”—a multinational Erasmus+ Capacity Building in Higher Education funded project. By sharing European educational experience and knowledge, the project aims to enhance professionalism and strengthen leadership aspects of the public health workforce in Israel to meet the needs of employers and the country. The project’s work packages, each jointly led by an Israeli and European institution, include field qualification analysis, mapping public health academic training programs, workforce adaptation, and building leadership capacity. In the era of global health changes, it is crucial to assess the capacity building of a well-qualified and competent workforce that enables providing good health services, reaching out to minorities, preventing health inequalities, and confronting emerging health challenges. We anticipate that the methods developed and the lessons learned within the Israeli context will be adaptable and adoptable by other countries through local and cultural adjustments.","Bashkin, Osnat; Dopelt, Keren; Mor, Zohar; Leighton, Lore; Otok, Robert; Duplaga, Mariusz; MacLeod, Fiona; De Nooijer, Jascha; Neumark, Yehuda; Paillard-Borg, Stephanie; Tulchinsky, Theodore; Zelber-Sagi, Shira; Davidovitch, Nadav",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179265; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501853/,383
640715,Patients with cirrhosis during the COVID-19 pandemic: Current evidence and future perspectives,2021-05-06,"Human coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause respiratory infection epidemics that sometimes expand into globally relevant pandemics. All human CoVs have sister strains isolated from animal hosts and seem to have an animal origin, yet the process of host jumping is largely unknown. RNA interference (RNAi) is an ancient mechanism in many eukaryotes to defend against viral infections through the hybridization of host endogenous small RNAs (miRNAs) with target sites in invading RNAs. Here, we developed a method to identify potential RNAi-sensitive sites in the viral genome and discovered that human-adapted coronavirus strains had deleted some of their sites targeted by miRNAs in human lungs when compared to their close zoonic relatives. We further confirmed using a phylogenetic analysis that the loss of RNAi-sensitive target sites could be a major driver of the host-jumping process, and adaptive mutations that lead to the loss-of-target might be as simple as point mutation. Up-to-date genomic data of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and Middle-East respiratory syndromes-CoV strains demonstrate that the stress from host miRNA milieus sustained even after their epidemics in humans. Thus, this study illustrates a new mechanism about coronavirus to explain its host-jumping process and provides a novel avenue for pathogenesis research, epidemiological modeling, and development of drugs and vaccines against coronavirus, taking into consideration these findings.","Meng, Qingren; Chu, Yanan; Shao, Changjun; Chen, Jing; Wang, Jian; Gao, Zhancheng; Yu, Jun; Kang, Yu",Brief Bioinform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33587745/; https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab027,383

641456,Spontaneous Pneumomediastinum/Pneumothorax in Patients With COVID-19,2020-07-03,"BACKGROUND: Bats are amongst the natural reservoirs of many coronaviruses (CoVs) of which some can lead to severe infection in human. African bats are known to harbor a range of pathogens (e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses) that can infect humans and cause disease outbreaks. A recent study in South Africa isolated a genetic variant closely related to MERS-CoV from an insectivorous bat. Though Madagascar is home to 44 bat species (41 insectivorous and 3 frugivorous) of which 34 are endemic, no data exists concerning the circulation of CoVs in the island’s chiropteran fauna. Certain Malagasy bats can be frequently found in close contact with humans and frugivorous bats feed in the same trees where people collect and consume fruits and are hunted and consumed as bush meat. The purpose of our study is to detect and identify CoVs from frugivorous bats in Madagascar to evaluate the risk of human infection from infected bats. METHODS: Frugivorous bats belonging to three species were captured in four different regions of Madagascar. We analyzed fecal and throat swabs to detect the presence of virus through amplification of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, which is highly conserved in all known coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses were performed from positive specimens. RESULTS: From 351 frugivorous bats, we detected 14 coronaviruses from two endemic bats species, of which 13 viruses were identified from Pteropus rufus and one from Eidolon dupreanum, giving an overall prevalence of 4.5%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Malagasy strains belong to the genus Betacoronavirus but form three distinct clusters, which seem to represent previously undescribed genetic lineages. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CoVs circulate in frugivorous bats of Madagascar, demonstrating the needs to evaluate spillover risk to human populations especially for individuals that hunt and consume infected bats. Possible dispersal mechanisms as to how coronaviruses arrived on Madagascar are discussed.","Razanajatovo, Norosoa H; Nomenjanahary, Lalaina A; Wilkinson, David A; Razafimanahaka, Julie H; Goodman, Steven M; Jenkins, Richard K; Jones, Julia PG; Heraud, Jean-Michel",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0271-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25888853/,383

The industrial ethanol fermentation microbes cannot metabolize the alginate component of macro algae, which affects the ethanol yield. In this research, the ethanol production process from macro algae by an alginate fermentation yeast Meyerozyma guilliermondii, especially the pretreatment process of Colpomenia sinuosa, was studied. At the same time, the experimental design of Box-Behnken was carried out to achieve the optimum fermentation performance. The concentration of KH(2)PO(4) (A: 2–6 g.L(−1)), pH (B: 4–7), reaction time (C: 60–120 h) and temperature (D: 24–34 °C) were variable input parameters. During the ethanol production process, the algae powder was firstly mixed with water at 90 °C for 0.5 h. Later the fermentation culture medium was prepared and then it was fermented by the yeast Meyerozyma guilliermondii to produce ethanol. And the optimal fermentation parameters were as follows: fermentation temperature of 28 °C, KH(2)PO(4) dosage of 4.7 g.L(−1), initial pH of 6, and fermentation time of 99 h. The ethanol yield reached 0.268 g.g(−1) (ethanol to algae), close to the predicted value of model. The generation of alginate lyase during the fermentation of algae was also examined.

A comprehensive review for clinical trials assessing the safety of COVID-19 vaccines is urgently needed to make an accurate judgment for mass vaccination. MAIN TEXT: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the safety of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Data search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, Scopus, Web of Science, and MedRxiv. Included articles were limited to RCTs on COVID-19 vaccines. A total of 73,633 subjects from 14 articles were included to compare the risks of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) after vaccinating different COVID-19 vaccines. Pooled risk ratios (RR) of total AEFI for inactivated vaccine, viral-vectored vaccine, and mRNA vaccine were 1.34 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11–1.61, P < 0.001], 1.65 (95% CI 1.31–2.07, P < 0.001), and 2.01 (95% CI 1.78–2.26, P < 0.001), respectively. No significant differences on local and systemic AEFI were found between the first dose and second dose. In addition, people aged ≤ 55 years were at significantly higher risk of AEFI than people aged ≥ 56 years, with a pooled RR of 1.25 (95% CI 1.15–1.35, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The safety and tolerance of current COVID-19 vaccine candidates are acceptable for mass vaccination, with inactivated COVID-19 vaccines candidates having the lowest reported AEFI. Long-term surveillance of vaccine safety is required, especially among elderly people with underlying medical conditions.

643316,Anticoagulant treatment in COVID-19: a narrative review,2020-08-18,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in China in December 2019 which was later declared to be a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). This virus proved to be very contagious resulting in life-threatening respiratory intricacies posing overall public health and governance challenges. Amid the coronavirus pandemic and the unprecedented increase in healthcare demands, only inventive and adaptive practice among healthcare professionals is the need of the hour. Pharmacy services are an important mainstay in the public health and have considerable potential to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Pharmacists working in several localities and health facilities are linked to patients either directly or indirectly. They can act swiftly in public health response such as drafting professional service guidance to pharmacists working in various healthcare facilities, ensuring effective medicine supply system, monitoring and resolving drug shortage issues, establishing and promoting remote pharmacy services, counseling the public on infection prevention basics, educating about proper use of personal protective equipment, discouraging self-medication, participating in clinical trials, small-scale manufacturing of sanitizers and disinfectants, busting the prevailing myths, and conducting drug evaluation and active surveillance. These interventions will help ease unprecedented burden on healthcare facilities during the ongoing pandemic and eventually will add value to patients and the healthcare system. The current manuscript accentuates the potential roles and activities that pharmacists can initiate in various healthcare facilities to help in relieving pressure on the overwhelmed healthcare system. The information and suggestions offered in this review could help in the restructuring of existing pharmacy services by governments, public health bodies, and policy makers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, this manuscript will underscore any unrealized potential among pharmacists working in various sectors including community, hospital, industry, and drug regulatory authorities.","Mallhi, Tauqeer Hussain; Liaqat, Aroosa; Abid, Arooj; Khan, Yusra Habib; Alotaibi, Nasser Hadal; Alzarea, Abdulaziz Ibrahim; Tanveer, Nida; Khan, Tahir Mehmood",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.561924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33364224/,383

The true risk of a COVID-19 resurgence as states prepare to reopen businesses is unknown. Objective: To quantify the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission in business establishments by building a risk index for each business that measures transmission risk over time. Design: This retrospective case series study uses anonymized cell phone GPS data to analyze trends in traffic patterns to businesses that may be potentially high-risk from January 2020 to June 2020. Setting: Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, New York, and California. Participants: 1,272,260 businesses within 8 states from January 2020 - June 2020. Exposure(s): We monitored business traffic before the pandemic, during the pandemic and after early phases of reopening in 8 states. Main Outcome: Our primary outcome is our business risk index. The index was built using two metrics: visitors per square foot and the average duration of visits. Visitors per square foot account for how densely visitors are packed into businesses. The average duration of visits accounts for the length of time visitors are spending in a business. Results: Potentially risky traffic behaviors at businesses decreased by 30% by April. Since the end of April, the risk index has been increasing as states reopen. On average, it has increased between 10 to 20 percentage points since April and is moving towards pre-pandemic levels of traffic. There are some notable differences in trends across states and industries. Conclusion: Our risk index provides a way for policymakers and hospital decision makers to monitor the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission from businesses based on the frequency and density of visits to businesses. Traffic is slowly moving towards pre-pandemic levels. This can serve as an important metric as states monitor and evaluate their reopening strategies.","O039, Ashley L; Donoghue,; Dechen, Tenzin; Pavlova, Whitney; Boals, Michael; Moussa, Garba; Madan, Manvi; Thakkar, Aalok; DeFalco, Frank J; Stevens, Jennifer P",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.24.20112110v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.24.20112110,383

644915,An unexpected and suspended time,2020-04-22,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges for health care facilities worldwide. Global production and shipping routes were disrupted, and health care institutions, even in high resource areas, found themselves lacking the basic supplies for effective infection prevention and control. One major hurdle was the global access to supplies, particularly N95/FFP2 masks and alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) for performing hand hygiene. This chapter explores how the lack of masks and ABHR were addressed through local production and the disinfection and reuse of disposable N95 masks. Although the global situation is no longer dire, the pandemic is currently still underway, and access to sufficient and high-quality supplies still is an important challenge faced by health care institutions. Previously, local production was mainly promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a social business venture for helping developing countries. Disposable mask reuse was barely studied until this pandemic, because there was never really a need to. Thus the literature in these fields are mostly quite new. This chapter reviews the introduction and state of the art of the field, the evidence for hand hygiene and masking in the literature, the global situation since the pandemic and strategies that countries have taken to adapt. It then concentrates further on the specifics of local production, both for ABHR and for masks, and on the issues surrounding mask reuse. The chapter concludes with putting these technologies in the larger context of the pandemic, and how learning how the world tried to implement solutions can teach us lessons for future emergencies.","Peters, Alexandra; Guitart, Chloé; Pittet, Didier",Environmental and Health Management of Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19 ),https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-85780-2.00008-1,383

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated challenges in accessing obstetrical ultrasound for patients in underserved rural and remote communities where this service is not available. This prospective descriptive study describes our experience of providing obstetrical ultrasound services remotely using a telerobotic ultrasound system in a northern Canadian community isolated due to a COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A telerobotic ultrasound system was used to perform obstetrical ultrasound exams remotely in La Loche, Canada, a remote community without regular access to obstetrical ultrasound. Using a telerobotic ultrasound system, a sonographer 605 km away remotely controlled an ultrasound probe and ultrasound settings. Twenty-one exams were performed in a five-week period during a COVID-19 outbreak in the community, including limited first-, second- and third-trimester exams (n = 11) and complete second-trimester exams (n = 10). Participants were invited to complete a survey at the end of the telerobotic ultrasound exam describing their experiences with telerobotic ultrasound. Radiologists subsequently interpreted all exams and determined the adequacy of the images for diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 11 limited obstetrical exams, radiologists indicated images were adequate in nine (81%) cases, adequate with some reservations in one (9%) case and inadequate in one (9%) case. Of 10 second-trimester complete obstetrical exams, radiologists indicated images were adequate in two (20%) cases, adequate with some reservations in three (30%) cases and inadequate in five (50%) cases. Second-trimester complete obstetrical exams were limited due to a combination of body habitus, foetal lie and telerobotic technology. DISCUSSION: A telerobotic ultrasound system may be used to answer focused clinical questions such as foetal viability, dating and foetal presentation in a timely manner while minimising patient travel to larger centres and potential exposure to severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus 2 during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Adams, Scott J; Burbridge, Brent; Chatterson, Leslie; McKinney, Veronica; Babyn, Paul; Mendez, Ivar",J Telemed Telecare,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33076753/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x20965422,383

Emerging COVID-19 infection, caused by the novel SARS-CoV2, is now a pandemic, bringing a substantial burden to human health. Interferon (IFN), combined with other antivirals and various treatments, has been used to treat and prevent MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2 infections. We aimed to assess the clinical efficacy of IFN-based treatments and combinational therapy with antivirals, corticosteroids, traditional medicine, and other treatments. Major healthcare databases and grey literature were investigated. A three-stage screening was utilized, and included studies were checked against the protocol eligibility criteria. Risk of bias assessment and data extraction were performed, followed by narrative data synthesis. Fifty-five distinct studies of SARS-CoV2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV were spotted. Our narrative synthesis showed a possible benefit in the use of IFN. A good quality cohort showed lower CRP levels in Arbidol (ARB) + IFN group vs. IFN only group. Another study reported a significantly shorter chest X-ray (CXR) resolution in IFN-Alfacon-1 + corticosteroid group compared with the corticosteroid only group in SARS-CoV patients. In a COVID-19 trial, total adverse drug events (ADEs) were much lower in the Favipiravir (FPV) + IFN-α group compared with the LPV/RTV arm (P = 0.001). Also, nausea in patients receiving FPV + IFN-α regimen was significantly lower (P = 0.03). Quantitative analysis of mortality did not show a conclusive effect for IFN/RBV treatment in six moderately heterogeneous MERS-CoV studies (log OR=-0.05, 95% CI: (-0.71,0.62), I(2) =44.71%). A meta-analysis of three COVID-19 studies did not show a conclusive nor meaningful relation between receiving IFN and COVID-19 severity (log OR=-0.44, 95% CI: (-1.13,0.25), I(2) =31.42%). A lack of high-quality cohorts and controlled trials was observed. Evidence suggests the potential efficacy of several combination IFN therapies such as lower ADEs, quicker resolution of CXR, or a decrease in inflammatory cytokines; Still, these options must possibly be further explored before being recommended in public guidelines. For all major CoVs, our results may indicate a lack of a definitive effect of IFN treatment on mortality. We recommend such therapeutics be administered with extreme caution until further investigation uncovers high-quality evidence in favor of IFN or combination therapy with IFN.","Saleki, Kiarash; Yaribash, Shakila; Banazadeh, Mohammad; Hajihosseinlou, Ehsan; Gouravani, Mahdi; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Eur J Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34126092/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014299921004015; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.174248; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299921004015?v=s5,383

DESIGN: National retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Emergency childhood primary and secondary care providers across Scotland; two national paediatric intensive care units (PICUs); statutory death records. PARTICIPANTS: 273 455 unscheduled primary care attendances; 462 437 emergency department attendances; 54 076 emergency hospital admissions; 413 PICU unplanned emergency admissions requiring invasive mechanical ventilation; and 415 deaths during the lockdown study period and equivalent dates in previous years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of emergency care consultations, attendances and admissions; clinical severity scores on presentation to PICU; rates and causes of childhood death. For all data sets, rates during the lockdown period were compared with mean or aggregated rates for the equivalent dates in 2016–2019. RESULTS: The rates of emergency presentations to primary and secondary care fell during lockdown in comparison to previous years. Emergency PICU admissions for children requiring invasive mechanical ventilation also fell as a proportion of cases for the entire population, with an OR of 0.52 for likelihood of admission during lockdown (95% CI 0.37 to 0.73), compared with the equivalent period in previous years. Clinical severity scores did not suggest children were presenting with more advanced disease. The greatest reduction in PICU admissions was for diseases of the respiratory system; those for injury, poisoning or other external causes were equivalent to previous years. Mortality during lockdown did not change significantly compared with 2016–2019. CONCLUSIONS: National lockdown led to a reduction in paediatric emergency care utilisation, without associated evidence of severe harm.","Williams, Thomas C; MacRae, Clare; Swann, Olivia V; Haseeb, Haris; Cunningham, Steve; Davies, Philip; Gibson, Neil; Lamb, Christopher; Levin, Richard; McDougall, Catherine M; McFadzean, Jillian; Piper, Ian; Turner, Alastair; Turner, Stephen W; Van Dijke, Margrethe; Urquhart, Donald S; Guthrie, Bruce; Langley, Ross J",Arch Dis Child,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33451994/; https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2020-321008,383

Thus, mobility restrictions of varying degrees up to and including nationwide lockdowns have been implemented in over 200 countries. To appropriately target the timing, location, and severity of measures intended to encourage social distancing at a country level, it is essential to predict when and where outbreaks will occur, and how widespread they will be. Methods We analyze aggregated, anonymized health data and cell phone mobility data from Israel. We develop predictive models for daily new cases and the test positivity rate over the next 7 days for different geographic regions in Israel. We evaluate model goodness of fit using root mean squared error (RMSE). We use these predictions in a five-tier categorization scheme to predict the severity of COVID-19 in each region over the next week. We measure magnitude accuracy (MA), the extent to which the correct severity tier is predicted. Results Models using mobility data outperformed models that did not use mobility data, reducing RMSE by 17.3% when predicting new cases and by 10.2% when predicting the test positivity rate. The best set of predictors for new cases consisted of 1-day lag of past 7-day average new cases, along with a measure of internal movement within a region. The best set of predictors for the test positivity rate consisted of 3-days lag of past 7-day average test positivity rate, along with the same measure of internal movement. Using these predictors, RMSE was 4.812 cases per 100,000 people when predicting new cases and 0.79% when predicting the test positivity rate. MA in predicting new cases was 0.775, and accuracy of prediction to within one tier was 1.0. MA in predicting the test positivity rate was 0.820, and accuracy to within one tier was 0.998. Conclusions Using anonymized, macro-level data human mobility data along with health data aids predictions of when and where COVID-19 outbreaks are likely to occur. Our method provides a useful tool for government decision makers, particularly in the post-vaccination era, when focused interventions are needed to contain COVID-19 outbreaks while mitigating the collateral damage of more global restrictions.","Guan, G.; Dery, Y.; Yechezkel, M.; Ben-Gal, I.; Yamin, D.; Brandeau, M.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.20.21257557; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.20.21257557v1?rss=1,383
647093,Infection Control in Interventional Radiology During the COVID-19 Era,2021-01-09,"In this review, we consider the role played by eosinophilic leukocytes in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of respiratory virus infection. The vast majority of the available information on this topic focuses on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; Family Paramyxoviridae, genus Pneumovirus), an important pediatric pathogen that infects infants worldwide. There is no vaccine currently available for RSV. A formalininactivated RSV vaccine used in a trial in the 1960s elicited immunopathology in response to natural RSV infection; this has been modeled experimentally, primarily in inbred mice and cotton rats. Eosinophils are recruited to the lung tissue in response to formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine antigens in humans and in experimental models, but they may or may not be involved in promoting the severe clinical sequelae observed. Pulmonary eosinophilia elicited in response to primary RSV infection has also been explored; this response is particularly evident in the youngest human infants and in neonatal mouse models. Although pulmonary eosinophilia is nearly always perceived in a negative light, the specific role played by virus-elicited eosinophils - negative, positive or neutral bystander - remain unclear. Lastly, we consider the data that focus on the role of eosinophils in promoting virus clearance and antiviral host defense, and conclude with a recent study that explores the role of eosinophils themselves as targets of virus infection.

647384,Dermatological insights from Google Trends: what does the public think is important during COVID‐19 lockdown?,2020-06-03,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is the most recent zoonotic outbreak of coronaviruses. Mostly, it invades the cells of the respiratory system by binding to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is also present in other organs like the kidney, testis, ovaries, breast, heart, and intestine, rendering them prone to be infected. The reproductive potential is a must for the sustenance of any species and it is our prime duty to safeguard the reproductive system of the present generation from such a deadly virus. The previously reported coronaviruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) had a detrimental impact on reproductive organs. There is a dearth of sufficient research to provide substantial evidence for the harmful effects of this novel virus on the reproductive system. Hence, our review compiles the knowledge available until now to boost research in this regard and to take the necessary steps in time. MAIN BODY OF ABSTRACT: Here we tried to compile all the data available on the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the reproductive system as well as vertical transmission of the virus. All related articles published from February to August 2020 were reviewed and thoroughly analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 has been found to affect the sperm concentration and motility, thus degrading the fertility of males. In females, it is suspected that this virus affects the oocyte quality and ovarian function, resulting in infertility or miscarriage. Traces of SARS-CoV-2 virus have also been found in the breast milk of the infected mothers and the semen of infected males. Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported in some cases. CONCLUSION: Based on the literature review, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have the potential of affecting both male and female reproductive tracts. This review brings together the findings and observations made in the area of reproductive health during the current pandemic. The reproductive system of the young population is preordained for subsequent disorders, infertility, reduced sperm count, and motility. Therefore, the research and medical practices should focus on possible vulnerability being posed by SARS-CoV-2 to the gametes and future generations. We, hereby, recommend close monitoring of young and pregnant COVID-19 patients concerning reproductive health with utmost priority.","Sharma, Indu; Kumari, Priti; Sharma, Anuradha; Saha, Subhas Chandra",Middle East Fertil Soc J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437145/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s43043-020-00046-z,383

From the epidemiological data, the picture emerges that the more severe etiopathologies among COVID-19 patients are found in elderly people. The risk of death due to COVID-19 increases exponentially with age. Eight out of 10 COVID-19 related deaths occur in people older than 65 years of age. Older patients with comorbid conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer have a much higher case fatality rate. Governments and public health authorities all over the world have realized that protections of vulnerable older adults should be a priority during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease. The SARS-CoV-2 virus was originally transmitted likely from a bat or a pangolin to humans. Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2, similar to other coronaviruses, can infect several species of animals, including companion animals such as dogs, cats, and ferrets although their viral loads remain low. While the main source of infection transmission therefore is human to human, there are a few rare cases of pets contracting the infection from a SARS-CoV-2-infected human. Although there is no evidence that pets actively transmit SARS-CoV-2 via animal-to-human transmission, senior pet ownership potentially may pose a small risk to older adults by (1) potentially enabling animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the most vulnerable population and (2) by increasing the exposition risk for the elderly due to the necessity to care for the pet and, in the case of dogs, to take them outside the house several times per day. In this overview, the available evidence on SARS-CoV-2 infection in pets is considered and the potential for spread of COVID-19 from companion animals to older individuals and the importance of prevention are discussed.","Csiszar, Anna; Jakab, Ferenc; Valencak, Teresa G.; Lanszki, Zsófia; Tóth, Gábor Endre; Kemenesi, Gábor; Tarantini, Stefano; Fazekas-Pongor, Vince; Ungvari, Zoltan",GeroScience,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-020-00248-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32766998/,383

METHODS: A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed regarding the optimal confirmation of a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and of mimicking diseases and the assessment of inflammatory disease activity. PubMed and Embase databases were searched up to December 2019. Relevant papers were selected and appraised. RESULTS: Eighty-two papers were selected for detailed assessment. The identified evidence had several limitations: (1) no studies were found including D2T RA patients specifically, and only the minority of studies included RA patients in whom there was explicit doubt about the diagnosis of RA or presence of inflammatory activity; (2) mostly only correlations were reported, not directly useful to evaluate the accuracy of detecting inflammatory activity in clinical practice; (3) heterogeneous, and often suboptimal, reference standards were used and (4) (thus) only very few studies had a low risk of bias. To ascertain a diagnosis of RA or relevant mimicking disease, no diagnostic test with sufficient validity and accuracy was identified. To ascertain inflammatory activity in patients with RA in general and in those with obesity and fibromyalgia, ultrasonography (US) was studied most extensively and was found to be the most promising diagnostic test. CONCLUSIONS: This SLR highlights the scarcity of high-quality studies regarding diagnostic issues in D2T RA. No diagnostic tests with sufficient validity and accuracy were found to confirm nor exclude the diagnosis of RA nor its mimicking diseases in D2T RA patients. Despite the lack of high-quality direct evidence, US may have an additional value to assess the presence of inflammatory activity in D2T RA patients, including those with concomitant obesity or fibromyalgia.","Roodenrijs, Nadia M T; Kedves, Melinda; Hamar, Attila; Nagy, György; van Laar, Jacob M; van der Heijde, Désirée; Welsing, Paco M J",RMD Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/rmdopen-2020-001511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33514671/,383

Measures to reduce its spread critically depend on timely and accurate diagnosis of virus-infected individuals. Biobanks can have a pivotal role in elucidating disease etiology, translation, and advancing public health. In this article, we show how a biobank has been a critical resource in the rapid response to coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) in Uganda. Materials and Methods: The Integrated Biorepository of H3Africa Uganda established a COVID-19 biobank. Standard Operating Procedures for sample and data collection, sample processing, and storage were developed. An e-questionnaire data tool was used to collect sociodemographic factors. Samples were collected at 7-day intervals from patients, analyzed for key parameters, processed, annotated, characterized, and stored at appropriate temperatures. Results: Stored samples have been used in validation of 17 diagnostic kits, the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay, as well as a sample pooling technique for mass screening and polymerase chain reaction assay validation. Kits that passed validation were deployed for mass screening boosting early detection, isolation, and treatment of COVID-19 cases. Also, 10 applications from researchers and biotech companies have been received and approved and 4 grants have been awarded Conclusion: The CoV-Bank has proven to be an invaluable resource in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda, as samples have been resources in the validation and development of COVID-19 diagnostic tools, which are important in tracing and isolation of infected cases to confront, delay, and stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Kamulegeya, Rogers; Kateete, David Patrick; Bagaya, Bernard S; Nasinghe, Emmanuel; Muttamba, Winters; Nsubuga, Gideon; Kigozi, Edgar; Katabazi, Fred Ashaba; Nakwagala, Fred; Kalungi, Sam; Byamugisha, Josaphat; Worodria, William; Magala, Rose; Kirenga, Bruce; Joloba, Moses L",Biopreserv. biobank.

649944,Composition of the immunoglobulin G glycome associates with the severity of COVID-19,2020,"The unique clinical features of COVID-19 disease present a formidable challenge in the understanding of its pathogenesis. Within a very short time, our knowledge regarding basic physiological pathways that participate in SARS-CoV-2 invasion and subsequent organ damage have been dramatically expanded. In particular, we now better understand the complexity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the important role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 in viral binding. Furthermore, the critical role of its major product, angiotensin (Ang)-(1–7), in maintaining microcirculatory balance and in the control of activated proinflammatory and procoagulant pathways, generated in this disease, have been largely clarified. The kallikrein-bradykinin (BK) system and chymase are intensively interwoven with RAAS through many pathways with complex reciprocal interactions. Yet, so far, very little attention has been paid to a possible role of these physiological pathways in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease, even though BK and chymase exert many physiological changes characteristic to this disorder. Herein, we outline the current knowledge regarding the reciprocal interactions of RAAS, BK, and chymase that are probably turned-on in COVID-19 disease and participate in its clinical features. Interventions affecting these systems, such as the inhibition of chymase or blocking BKB1R/BKB2R, might be explored as potential novel therapeutic strategies in this devastating disorder.","Abassi, Zaid; Skorecki, Karl; Hamo-Giladi, Dalit B.; Kruzel-Davila, Etty; Heyman, Samuel N.",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00548.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33404363/,383

Indirect immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal antibodies revealed that glycoprotein E2 exhibits different antigenic properties depending on the presence and on the structure of the N-linked oligosaccharides and that efficient transport of glycoprotein E2 to the plasma membrane requires the removal of glucose residues. In the presence of tunicamycin in the nonglycosylated E2 apoprotein was synthesized in normal amounts and readily acylated throughout the infectious cycle. This E2-species could not be detected on the surface of mouse hepatitis virus A59-infected cells with indirect immunofluorescence staining or lactoperoxidase labeling. N-Methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin and castanospermine, both of which selectively inhibited the processing glucosidases, caused a drop in virion formation by two log steps and a drastic delay in the surface expression of glycoprotein E2. The E2 species synthesized under such conditions was acylated but accumulated intracellularly in a compartment distinct from the Golgi. Concomitantly, synthesis of the matrix glycoprotein E1 of mouse hepatitis virus A59 was drastically impaired. Mannodeoxynojirimycin and swainsonine, which block later stages of the processing pathway, had less or no effect on the transport of glycoprotein E2 and the formation of virus particles.","Repp, R; Tamura, T; Boschek, C B; Wege, H; Schwarz, R T; Niemann, H",Journal of Biological Chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2999142/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925817363391; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925817363391,383

Orthopoxvirus (OPV) DNA was detected in tissues (lung, kidney, spleen) in 24 (9%) of 263 free-ranging Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) from Sweden. Thymidine kinase gene amplicon sequences (339 bp) from 21 lynx were all identical to those from cowpox virus isolated from a person in Norway and phylogenetically closer to monkeypox virus than to vaccinia virus and isolates from 2 persons with cowpox virus in Sweden. Prevalence was higher among animals from regions with dense, rather than rural, human populations. Lynx are probably exposed to OPV through predation on small mammal reservoir species. We conclude that OPV is widely distributed in Sweden and may represent a threat to humans. Further studies are needed to verify whether this lynx OPV is cowpox virus.","Tryland, Morten; Okeke, Malachy Ifeanyi; af Segerstad, Carl Hård; Mörner, Torsten; Traavik, Terje; Ryser-Degiorgis, Marie-Pierre",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21470451/; https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1704.091899,383

It is expected that the world will need to battle the COVID-19 pandemic with precautious measures, until an effective vaccine is developed. This paper proposes a real-time COVID-19 detection and monitoring system. The proposed system would employ an Internet of Things (IoTs) framework to collect real-time symptom data from users to early identify suspected coronaviruses cases, to monitor the treatment response of those who have already recovered from the virus, and to understand the nature of the virus by collecting and analyzing relevant data. The framework consists of five main components: Symptom Data Collection and Uploading (using wearable sensors), Quarantine/Isolation Center, Data Analysis Center (that uses machine learning algorithms), Health Physicians, and Cloud Infrastructure. To quickly identify potential coronaviruses cases from this real-time symptom data, this work proposes eight machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Decision Table, Decision Stump, OneR, and ZeroR. An experiment was conducted to test these eight algorithms on a real COVID-19 symptom dataset, after selecting the relevant symptoms. The results show that five of these eight algorithms achieved an accuracy of more than 90%. Based on these results we believe that real-time symptom data would allow these five algorithms to provide effective and accurate identification of potential cases of COVID-19, and the framework would then document the treatment response for each patient who has contracted the virus.","Otoom, Mwaffaq; Otoum, Nesreen; Alzubaidi, Mohammad A.; Etoom, Yousef; Banihani, Rudaina",Biomed Signal Process Control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2020.102149; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1746809420302949; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809420302949?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834831/,383

This study aims to evaluate the risk factors for hospitalization in pediatric influenza A and B for the recent seasons. METHODS Children with a fever of ≥38 °C and laboratory-confirmed influenza at 20 hospitals in outpatient settings in Japan in the 2013/14 to 2019/20 seasons were retrospectively reviewed. Possible risk factors, including gender, age, comorbidities, nursery school or kindergarten attendance, earlier diagnosis, no immunization, lower regional temperature, earlier season, and period of onset, were evaluated using binary logistic regression methods. RESULTS A total of 13,040 (type A, 8861; B, 4179) children were evaluated. Significant risk factors (p < 0.05) in multivariate analyses were young age, lower regional temperature, earlier season, respiratory illness (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:2.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.84-4.13), abnormal behavior and/or unusual speech (aOR:2.78, 95% CI:1.61-4.80), and seizures at onset (aOR:16.8, 95% CI:12.1-23.3) for influenza A; and young age, lower regional temperature, respiratory illness (aOR:1.99, 95% CI:1.00-3.95), history of febrile seizures (aOR:1.73, 95% CI:1.01-2.99), and seizures at onset (aOR:9.74, 95% CI:5.44-17.4) for influenza B. CONCLUSIONS In addition to previously known factors, including young age, seizures, and respiratory illness, abnormal behavior and/or unusual speech and lower regional temperature are new factors. Negative immunization status was not a risk factor for hospitalization.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study examining antibiotic prescribing patterns of 300 patients sequentially diagnosed with COVID-19. Patients were grouped into 3 sub-cohorts: Group 1 received no antibiotics, Group 2 received antibiotics for microbiologically confirmed infections and Group 3 was empirically treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. The primary aim was to identify factors that influenced prescription and continuation of antibiotics in Group 3. Secondary aims were to examine differences in outcomes between groups. RESULTS: In total, 292 patients were included (63 Group 1, 35 Group 2, 194 Group 3), median age was 60 years (IQR 44–76) and the majority were ethnically Irish (62%). The median duration of antibiotics was 7 days (IQR 5–10). In Group 3, factors associated with prescription IV antibiotics on admission were raised C-reactive protein (CRP) (P = 0.024), increased age (P = 0.023), higher quick SOFA (P = 0.016) score and fever >37.5 °C (P = 0.011). Factors associated with duration of antibiotic course were duration of hypoxia (P < 0.001) and maximum respiratory support requirement (P = 0.013). Twenty-one patients in Group 3 had one or more antibiotic escalation events, most (n = 139) had no escalation or de-escalation of therapy.

Recent progress in genome editing opens new avenues in synthetic biology. These developments allow the efficient engineering of microbial genomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that can then be rescued to yield modified bacteria/viruses. Recent examples show that the ability to quickly synthesize, assemble and/or modify viral and bacterial genomes may be a critical factor to respond to emerging pathogens. However, this process has some limitations. DNA molecules much larger than two megabase pairs are complex to clone, bacterial genomes have proven difficult to rescue, and the dual-use potential of these technologies must be carefully considered. Regardless, the use of yeast as a factory has enormous appeal for biological applications.","Vashee, Sanjay; Arfi, Yonathan; Lartigue, Carole",Curr Opin Syst Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452310020300354?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coisb.2020.09.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452310020300354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015421/,383
653116,Treatment recommendations for patients with vitiligo during COVID‐19,2021-05-24,"Abstract Phage-displayed peptide libraries were used to map immunologically relevant epitopes on the surface (S) glycoprotein of a neurotropic murine coronavirus (MHV-A59). Three in vitro virus-neutralizing and in vivo protective mAbs against either continuous or discontinuous epitopes on the S glycoprotein were used to screen 12 different peptide libraries expressed on the pVIII major coat protein of the fd filamentous bacteriophage. Consensus sequences that matched short sequences within the S glycoprotein were identified. The sequence of a tight-binding, mAb-selected peptide suggested the location of a discontinuous epitope within the N-terminal S1 subunit. Several tightly binding phage were amplified and used directly as immunogens in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Partial protection of C57BL/6 mice against a lethal acute virus infection was achieved with a phage preparation that displayed a linear epitope. Protection correlated with the presence of sufficient levels of specific antiviral antibodies recognizing the same immunodominant domain and 13-mer peptide, located within the C-terminal S2 subunit, as the selecting mAb. Thus, the direct use of phage-displayed peptides to evaluate protective antiviral immune responses complements their use to characterize antibody-binding epitopes. This is the first evaluation of protective immunization induced by mAb-selected phage-displayed peptides.","Yu, Mathilde W.N.; Scott, Jamie K.; Fournier, Alain; Talbot, Pierre J.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10814583/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682200903106; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682200903106,383
654026,Extending the range of COVID-19 risk factors ina Bayesian network model for personalised riskassessment,2020-10-21,"Global pandemics are likely to increase in frequency and severity, and media communication of key messages represents an important mediator of the behavior of individuals in response to public health countermeasures. Where the media places responsibility during a pandemic is therefore important to study as blame is commonly used as a tool to influence public behavior but can also lead to the subjective persecution of groups. The aim of this paper is to investigate where the media places responsibility for COVID-19 in Australia. Specifically, we identify the key themes and frames that are present and observe how they changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to government actions and progression of the pandemic. Understanding media representations of the COVID-19 pandemic will provide insights into ways in which responsibility is framed in relation to health action. Newspaper articles from the Australian and the Sydney Morning Herald were sampled between January 20 and March 31 2020 on every second Monday. Factiva was used to identify and download newspaper articles using the following search criteria: “COVID-19” OR coronavirus OR “Wuhan virus” OR “corona virus” OR “Hebei virus” OR “wet market” OR (Wuhan AND virus) OR (market AND Wuhan and virus) or (China AND Virus) or (Novel AND Virus). Articles were imported into Nvivo and thematic and framing analyses were used. The results show that framing of the pandemic was largely based on societal issues with the theme of economic disruption prevalent throughout the study time period. Moral evaluations of the pandemic were infrequent initially but increased co-incident with the first signs of “flattening of the curve.” Explicit examples of blame were very rare but were commonly implied based on the causal origin of the virus. The Australian printed media were slow to report on the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition they were reluctant to apportion blame until the end of the study period, after confirmed case rates had begun to slow. This is interpreted as being due to an evaluation of the pandemic risks as low by the media and therefore the tools of othering and blame were not used until after the study period when the actual risks had begun to abate, more consistent with an inquiry than a mediating mechanism.","Thomas, Trevor; Wilson, Annabelle; Tonkin, Emma; Miller, Emma R.; Ward, Paul R.",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32974266/,383

METHOD: A case series of COVID-19 patients with RD on disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were studied by a retrospective chart review. A literature search identified 9 similar studies of single cases and case series, which were also included. RESULTS: There were 4 COVID-19 inpatients with RD from our hospital, and the mean age was 57 ± 21 years. Two patients had a mild infection, and 2 developed severe COVID-19 related respiratory complications, including 1 patient on secukinumab requiring mechanical ventilation and 1 patient on rituximab developing viral pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygenation. All 4 patients had elevated acute phase reactants, 2 patients had mild COVID-19 with lymphopenia, and 2 patients had severe COVID-19 with normal lymphocyte counts, and high levels of IL-6. None of the patients exhibited an exacerbation of their underlying RD. In the literature, there were 9 studies of COVID-19 involving 197 cases of various inflammatory RD. Most patients were on DMARDs or biologics, of which TNFα inhibitors were most frequently used. Two tocilizumab users had a mild infection. Two patients were on rituximab with 1 severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. Six patients were on secukinumab with 1 hospitalization. Of the total 201 cases, 12 died, with an estimated mortality of 5.9% CONCLUSION: Patients with RD are susceptible to COVID-19. Various DMARDs or biologics may affect the viral disease course differently. Patients on hydroxychloroquine, TNFα antagonists or tocilizumab may have a mild viral illness. Rituximab or secukinumab could worsen the viral disease.

654571,Pulmonary Covid Fibrosis a New Pharmaceutic Approach,2021-03-29,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently the most significant public health challenge. Its presentation ranges from mild to severe respiratory failure and septic shock. Rapid transmission of the virus is dangerous with a high possibility of life-threatening complications. Lack of treatment standards for SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current dilemma in clinical medicine. METHODS: An electronic literature search was done using PubMed to gather information on the pathogenesis, transmission of infection, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and therapeutic options for COVID-19. Search items included “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19” and “coronavirus infection”. RESULTS: In light of the current global crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2, the exchange of information within the scientific community should be quick and extremely transparent. Thus, this review presents the available information necessary for a general practitioner. Such presentation of data should allow the reader quick access to basic and crucial information related to epidemiology, viral transmission, clinical symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and complications that may occur in the course of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Rapidly increasing amounts of information about the diagnosis and treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 allow a better understanding of the etiology and course of the infection. In the current epidemiological situation, readily accessible information helps minimize the time to acquire knowledge and focus on prevention methods, diagnostic and treatment options. Thus, this review highlights key issues related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and contains the most useful data for daily medical practice.","Grygiel-Górniak, Bogna; Oduah, Mary-Tiffany",Clin Interv Aging,https://doi.org/10.2147/cia.s268607; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33442244/,383

Based on the historical data collected for COVID-19 spreading in 367 cities in China and the set of parameters of the augmented Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model obtained for each city, a set of profile codes representing a variety of transmission mechanisms and contact topologies is formed. By comparing the data of an early outbreak of a given population with the complete set of historical profiles, the best fit profiles are selected and the corresponding sets of profile codes are used for prediction of the future progression of the epidemic in that population. Application of the method to the data collected for South Korea, Italy and Iran shows that peaks of infection cases are expected to occur before mid April, the end of March and the end of May 2020, and that the percentage of population infected in each city or region will be less than 0.01%, 0.5% and 0.5%, for South Korea, Italy and Iran, respectively.","Zhan, Choujun; Tse, Chi K.; Lai, Zhikang; Hao, Tianyong; Su, Jingjing",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32628673/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234763,383

It is debatable whether cancer patients are at a significantly higher risk of severe COVID-19. The current study aims to assess the risk of severe and critical COVID-19 cases among patients receiving systemic anticancer treatment (SACT). Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study utilizing census sampling. The data was obtained through medical records. Inclusion criteria: COVID-19 diagnosis through RT-PCR/chest CT among those who received SACT in the Chemotherapy Departments of Hematology Center after prof. Yeolyan and Institute of Surgery after Mikaelyan Yerevan, Armenia between March 1, 2020, and February 1, 2021. Descriptive analysis was done to characterize the cohort. We run logistic regression to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 severity (mild, severe/critical) among those receiving SACT (high, intermediate, and low-risk protocols of febrile neutropenia (FN), age, gender, smoking status, comorbidities). Results: In total 75 cancer patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 in both centers. Data of only 72 patients were analyzed, as the outcome variable of the excluded patients was unknown. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1.5, age range was 31-80 years (median age: 61). The patients received SACT with high (13.9 %), intermediate (63.9 %), and low (8.3 %) risk for FN. The others did not receive SACT at the moment of COVID-19 diagnosis. Infection-associated pneumonia was developed in 63% of cases. Mild COVID-19 was diagnosed in 76.4% and severe/critical in 23.6% of cases. Infected patients’ hospitalization rate was 28%. The case fatality rate was 8%. Only patients who underwent SACT at the time of COVID-19 infection were included in logistic regression analysis (n=62). Significant association between COVID-19 severity and the risk of SACT-induced FN, gender, smoking status, comorbidities was not found. Contrary, COVID-19 severity was significantly associated with age when adjusted to other predictors (p=0.017, 95% CI = 1.021-1.230). Conclusions: Thus, we demonstrate the lack of rationale to reschedule SACT during the pandemic as it does not affect the COVID-19 severity and may bring unnecessary treatment delays.

These coinfections can add to significant mortality and morbidity. We are currently dealing with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which has affected over 15 million people globally with over half a million deaths. Previous respiratory viral pandemics have taught us that bacterial coinfections can lead to higher mortality and morbidity. However, there is limited literature on the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and associated coinfections, which reported infection rates varying between 1% and 8% based on various cross-sectional studies. In one meta-analysis of coinfections in COVID-19, rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae coinfections have been negligible when compared to previous influenza pandemics. Current literature does not favor the use of empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotics in confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. We present three cases of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections complicated by Streptococcus pneumoniae coinfection. These cases demonstrate the importance of concomitant testing for common pathogens despite the need for antimicrobial stewardship.","Pal, Chaitanya; Przydzial, Paulina; Chika-Nwosuh, Ogechukwu; Shah, Shrey; Patel, Pratik; Madan, Nikhil",Case Rep Pulmonol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33343959/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8849068,383
655962,Elective surgery after the pandemic: waves beyond the horizon,2020-05-08,"After World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, we all again realized the importance of developing rapid diagnostic kits. In this article, we introduced a lightweight and field-portable biosensor employing a plasmonic chip based on nanohole arrays integrated to a lensfree-imaging framework for label-free detection of viruses in field-settings. The platform utilizes a CMOS (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) camera with high quantum efficiency in the spectral window of interest to monitor diffraction field patterns of nanohole arrays under the uniform illumination of an LED (light-emitting diode) source which is spectrally tuned to the plasmonic mode supported by the nanohole arrays. As an example for the applicability of our biosensor for virus detection, we could successfully demonstrate the label-free detection of H1N1 viruses, e.g., swine flu, with medically relevant concentrations. We also developed a low-cost and easy-to-use sample preparation kit to prepare the surface of the plasmonic chip for analyte binding, e.g., virus-antibody binding. In order to reveal a complete biosensor technology, we also developed a user friendly Python™ – based graphical user interface (GUI) that allows direct access to biosensor hardware, taking and processing diffraction field images, and provides virus information to the end-user. Employing highly sensitive nanohole arrays and lensfree-imaging framework, our platform could yield an LOD as low as 10(3) TCID(50)/mL. Providing accurate and rapid sensing information in a handheld platform, weighing only 70 g and 12 cm tall, without the need for bulky and expensive instrumentation, our biosensor could be a very strong candidate for diagnostic applications in resource-poor settings. As our detection scheme is based on the use of antibodies, it could quickly adapt to the detection of different viral diseases, e.g., COVID-19 or influenza, by simply coating the plasmonic chip surface with an antibody possessing affinity to the virus type of interest. Possessing this ability, our biosensor could be swiftly deployed to the field in need for rapid diagnosis, which may be an important asset to prevent the spread of diseases before turning into a pandemic by isolating patients from the population.","Cetin, Arif E.; Kocer, Zeynep A.; Topkaya, Seda Nur; Yazici, Ziya Ata",Sens Actuators B Chem,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400521008698?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925400521008698; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2021.130301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149185/,383

In this study, the molecular cloning, expression, and antiporcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) activity of porcine IFN-λ3 (poIFN-λ3) were reported. The full-length poIFN-λ3 cDNA sequence encoded 196 amino acids with a 23 amino acid signal peptide. Sequence alignments showed that poIFN-λ3 had an amino acid sequence similarity to Ovis aries (78.1 %), Bos taurus (76.0 %), Tupaia belangeri (71.3 %), Equus caballus (69.9 %), and Homo sapiens (69.9 %). The phylogenetic analysis based on the genomic sequences indicated that poIFN-λ3 is located in the same branch as B. taurus and O. aries IFN-λ3. The poIFN-λ3 without a signal anchor sequence was efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant poIFN-λ3 exhibited significant antiviral effects against PEDV in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect of poIFN-λ3 on PEDV was observed under three different treatment conditions. The highest inhibition of PEDV was observed in Vero E6 cell cultures pretreated with poIFN-λ3 (prior to PEDV infection). In addition, poIFN-λ3 was able to induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes, including ISG15, OAS1, and Mx1 in Vero E6 cells. These data demonstrate that poIFN-λ3 has antiviral activity against PEDV and may serve as a useful biotherapeutic candidate to inhibit PEDV or other viruses in swine.","Shen, Haiyan; Zhang, Chunhong; Guo, Pengju; Liu, Zhicheng; Sun, Minhua; Sun, Junying; Li, Linlin; Dong, Jiawen; Zhang, Jianfeng",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27470155/,383

Methods Data were extracted from the BC Provincial Overdose Cohort (ODC) which includes a 20% random sample of BC residents and persons who have had a non-fatal overdose in BC from January 2015-December 2017. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to compare risk factors by overdose history. Results Persons who had an overdose were significantly more likely to have three (chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, coronary heart disease) of the four known chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19 compared to persons who did not have a previous non-fatal overdose event. Conclusion Persons who had an overdose were more likely to have several chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19. The increased likelihood of having these risk factors is reflective of the social and health inequities experienced by persons who have a history of overdose.","Slaunwhite, Amanda Kathleen; Gan, Wen Qi; Xavier, Chloe; Zhao, Bin; A Buxton, Jane; Desai, Roshni",Drug Alcohol Depend,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037687162030212X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32447172/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037687162030212X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108047,383

METHODS: This was a pre-planned secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey study of caregivers accompanying their children aged 0–19 years to 16 pediatric EDs in 5 countries from May to June 2020. An anonymous online survey, completed by caregivers via RedCAP, included caregiver and child demographics, presenting complaints, if they delayed presentation and whether symptoms worsened during this interval, as well as caregiver concern about the child or caregiver having COVID-19 at the time of ED visit. RESULTS: Of 1543 caregivers completing the survey, 287 (18.6%) reported a delay in seeking ED care due to concerns of contracting COVID-19 in the hospital. Of those, 124 (43.2%) stated their child’s symptoms worsened during the waiting interval. Caregiver relationship to child [mother] (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.27–2.76), presence of chronic illness in child (OR 1.78. 95% CI 1.14–2.79), younger age of caregiver (OR 0.965, 95% CI 0.943–0.986), and caregiver concerns about lost work during the pandemic (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04–1.12) were independently associated with a COVID-19-related delayed presentation in multivariable regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Almost one in five caregivers reported delaying ED presentation for their ill or injured child specifically due to fear of contracting COVID-19 while in hospital, with mothers, younger caregivers, caregivers of children with chronic illness, and those concerned about lost work more likely to report delaying ED presentation.

Within the sector, there is a global call for new models and practices, requiring HEIs to develop the management capabilities once reserved for businesses. In this sense, they will pave entrepreneurial pathways and contribute to economic, technological and societal developments in their regions, thus adding a third mission (engaging socio-economic needs and market demands) to the traditional two (education and research) and transforming themselves into more entrepreneurial institutions. Dynamic capabilities enable transformation processes by allowing the dynamic sensing and seizing of opportunities and risks and the promotion of iterative change and reconfiguration. Scholars have called on HEIs to develop such dynamic capabilities in order to transform themselves and better respond to their sector’s challenges. Nevertheless, the understanding of how dynamic capabilities might advance HEIs’ third mission is still an underexplored concept, and in this paper, we propose mechanisms that promise to transform dynamic capabilities into third mission advancement. We have developed numerous theoretically grounded hypotheses and tested them with a partial least squares structural equation model into which we funnelled data collected from key decision-makers at German HEIs. The results suggest that dynamic capabilities do indeed influence third mission advancement; however, this relationship is mediated by the role of leadership and organisational agreement on vision and goals.","Stolze, Audrey; Sailer, Klaus",J Technol Transf,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10961-021-09850-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33840891/,383

The significance of IP, however, is not well understood among clinicians and researchers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current status of IP awareness and IP-related behaviors among EAES members. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted via questionnaires sent to EAES members. Data collected included participant demographics, level of understanding the need, new ideas and solutions, basic IP knowledge, e.g., employees' inventions and public disclosure, behaviors before and after idea disclosures. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-nine completed forms were obtained through an email campaign conducted twice in 2019 (response rate = 4.8%). There was a dominancy in male, formally-trained gastrointestinal surgeons, working at teaching hospitals in European countries. Of the respondents, 71% demonstrated a high level of understanding the needs (frustration with current medical devices), with 66% developing specific solutions by themselves. Active discussion with others was done by 53%. Twenty-one percent of respondents presented their ideas at medical congresses, and 12% published in scientific journals. Only 20% took specific precautions or appropriate actions to protect their IPs before these disclosures. CONCLUSIONS: The current level of awareness of IP and IP-related issues is relatively low among EAES members. A structured IP training program to gain basic IP knowledge and skill should be considered a necessity for clinicians. These skills would serve to prevent the loss of legitimate IP rights and avoid failure in the clinical implementation of innovative devices for the benefit of patients.","Nakajima, Kiyokazu; Mintz, Yoav; Nickel, Felix; Arezzo, Alberto",Surg Endosc,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-021-08650-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34363113/,383

Globally, millions of patients with coronary heart disease undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) each year. These patients undergo high-intensity antithrombotic therapy during hospitalization and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for at least 6 months post PCI. COVID-19 is characterized by changes in platelet counts. Treatment of ischemic events that occur during stent implantation is associated with bleeding complications in patients following PCI complicated by COVID-19.

SARS‐CoV is transmissible mainly by the respiratory route and to date there is no vaccine and no prophylactic or therapeutic treatments against this agent. A SARS‐CoV whole‐genome approach has been developed aimed at determining the crystal structure of all of its proteins or domains. These studies are expected to greatly facilitate drug design. The genomes of coronaviruses are between 27 and 31.5 kbp in length, the largest of the known RNA viruses, and encode 20–30 mature proteins. The functions of many of these polypeptides, including the Nsp9–Nsp10 replicase‐cleavage products, are still unknown. Here, the cloning, Escherichia coli expression, purification and crystallization of the SARS‐CoV Nsp9 protein, the first SARS‐CoV protein to be crystallized, are reported.

Surgical mask (SM) wearing has been shown to be effective in reducing ARI among healthcare workers. However, the effectiveness of SM in reducing ARI in the non-healthcare settings remains unclear. This review aims to summarize and assess the association between SM wearing and ARI incidence, from existing interventional and observational studies conducted in non-healthcare settings. Methods: Systematic literature searches conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases identified 503 unique studies. After screening, 15 studies (5 randomized controlled trials and 10 observational studies) were assessed for reporting and methodological qualities. Proportions of ARI episodes in each group and adjusted summary statistics with their relevant 95% CIs were extracted. Data from 10 observational studies were pooled using the generic inverse variance method. Results: A total of 23,892 participants between 7 and 89 years old involved across 15 studies from 11 countries were involved. Key settings identified were Hajj, schools, and in-flight settings. A modest but non-significant protective effect of SM on ARI incidence was observed (pooled OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.8–1.15). Subgroup analysis according to age group, outcome ascertainment and different non-healthcare settings also revealed no significant associations between SM use and ARI incidence. Conclusion: Surgical mask wearing among individuals in non-healthcare settings is not significantly associated with reduction in ARI incidence in this meta-review.","Wang, Min Xian; Gwee, Sylvia Xiao Wei; Chua, Pearleen Ee Yong; Pang, Junxiong",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.564280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33102503/,383

An early diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial for disease treatment and control of the disease spread. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated a low sensibility; therefore chest computed tomography (CT) plays a pivotal role not only in the early detection and diagnosis, especially for false negative RT-PCR tests, but also in monitoring the clinical course and in evaluating the disease severity. This paper reports the CT findings with some hints on the temporal changes over the course of the disease: the CT hallmarks of COVID-19 are bilateral distribution of ground glass opacities with or without consolidation in the posterior and peripheral lung, but the predominant findings in later phases include consolidations, linear opacities, “crazy-paving” pattern, “reversed halo” sign and vascular enlargement. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of other diseases, in particular the viral pneumonia including influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, etc. There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. The aim of this article is to review the typical and atypical CT findings in COVID-19 patients in order to help radiologists and clinicians to become more familiar with the disease.","Carotti, Marina; Salaffi, Fausto; Sarzi-Puttini, Piercarlo; Agostini, Andrea; Borgheresi, Alessandra; Minorati, Davide; Galli, Massimo; Marotto, Daniela; Giovagnoni, Andrea",Radiol Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-020-01237-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32500509/,383

The latest stool sample that was positive by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was collected on day 75 while the patient was receiving intensive care. Tracheal aspirate and stool samples had a higher diagnostic yield (RT-PCR average positive rate for first 2 weeks: 66.7% and 56.5%, respectively). Pooled throat and nasal swabs, rectal swab, nasal swab, throat swab, and nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens provided a moderate yield (29.7%–40.0%), whereas throat washing and urine specimens showed a lower yield (17.3% and 4.5%). The collection procedures for stool and pooled nasal and throat swab specimens were the least likely to transmit infection, and the combination gave the highest yield for coronavirus detection by RT-PCR. Positive virologic test results in patient groups were associated with mechanical ventilation or death (p < 0.001), suggesting a correlation between viral load and disease severity.","Chan, Paul K.

Here we report a novel clinical presentation of H. cinaedi infection: a case of fever in a returning traveler. A 31 year old previously fit and well male presented with onset of fever 24 h after returning from travel in Singapore and Indonesia. Associated symptoms consisted of sore throat, mild shortness of breath, generalized myalgia and arthralgia, headache, and four episodes of loose stools. The patient recovered spontaneously without treatment and was discharged. After 4 days of incubation, blood cultures grew H. cinaedi. H. cinaedi is a slow-growing fastidious organism poorly detected by some commonly used automated blood culture systems, and difficult to identify using commercial or traditional biochemical identification systems. This case illustrates the importance of H. cinaedi as an emerging pathogen in immunocompetent patients, with a wide variety of possible clinical presentations. The challenges in the microbiological diagnosis of H. cinaedi infections lead us to speculate that H. cinaedi is an underdiagnosed cause of febrile illness, both in returning travelers and in other clinical settings.","Fox-Lewis, Andrew; Basu, Indira; Vesty, Anna; Henderson, Gillian; Chhibber, Aakash V.; Thomas, Mark",IDCases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idcr.2020.e00910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32695610/,383

Based on recent data suggesting its role as entheropathogen, a case-control study was conducted between 2013 and 2016 to investigate the association of CanineCV with gastroenteritis in dogs, alone or in combination with other viral pathogens, including canine parvovirus (CPV), canine coronavirus (CCoV) and canine distemper virus (CDV). A total of 219 dogs suffering from acute gastroenteritis disorders and 67 controls randomly recruited among healthy dogs or patients presenting without enteric signs were screened by a panel of real-time (RT-)PCR assays for CanineCV, CPV, CCoV and CDV. A high prevalence of viral infections was detected in dogs with gastroenteritis (77.16%), with CPV representing the most frequently detected enteropathogen, followed by CanineCV and CCoV. While CPV and CCoV infections displayed a strong association with occurrence of acute gastroenteritis (p < 0.00001), detection of CanineCV in control dogs (28.35%) occurred with prevalence comparable to that of clinical cases (32.42%), so that its correlation with gastrointestinal disease was not statistically supported (p = 0.530988). Different from the clinical cases, where co-infections were frequently observed, all positive samples from the control group contained single infections. Noteworthy, a significant association was calculated between co-infections with CanineCV and occurrence of acute gastroenteritis (p < 0.00001). This study supports the role of CanineCV as a co-pathogen in the development of gastrointestinal disease, mainly acting in synergism with other enteric viruses.","Dowgier, Giulia; Lorusso, Eleonora; Decaro, Nicola; Desario, Costantina; Mari, Viviana; Lucente, Maria Stella; Lanave, Gianvito; Buonavoglia, Canio; Elia, Gabriella",Vet Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.04.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28532806/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113517302389; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113517302389,383

METHODS: A lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network of DLBCL was constructed through database analysis combining GTEx and TCGA. qPCR was used to detect the expression of LINC00963 and miR-320a in DLBCL cell lines. After LINC00963 or miR-320a overexpression in vitro, western blot was performed to assess the protein levels of UPR sensors (GRP78, p-IRE1, IRE1, active ATF6, ATF4 and XBP1), along with apoptosis markers (Bcl-2, Bax, caspase 3) and autophagy indicators (Beclin1, LC3II, LC3I and p62). Additionally, the expression of LC3 was analyzed through immunofluorescence (IF) assay. RESULTS: Following LINC00963 overexpression in vitro, SUDHL4 cell line showed a marked increase in the level of UPR-related GRP78, p-IRE1 and spliced XBP-1/XBP-1(s), apoptosis-related Bax and cleaved caspase 3, as well as autophagy-related Beclin1 and LC3II, whereas miR-320a mimic greatly diminished the effects of LINC00963 overexpression. Moreover, LINC00963 targeted miR-320a while miR-320a bound to the 3’UTR of XBP1. It was also found that LINC00963 overexpression resulted in significantly delayed tumor growth in a xenograft model of DLBCL. CONCLUSION: Mechanistically, LINC00963/miR-320a regulated XBP1-apoptosis pathway and autophagy, implying the therapeutic potential of this pathway for selective targeting. The data presented here illustrated the mechanism of LINC00963/miR-320a/XBP1 in DLBCL for the first time.

This article aims to describe the methodology used and to document the main outcomes achieved. METHODS: New COVID-19 cases are supplied by the “Trajectoire de santé publique” information system, geolocated to civic addresses and then aggregated by day and dissemination area. To target community-level clusters, cases identified as residents of congregate living settings are excluded from the cluster detection analysis. Detection is performed using the space-time scan statistic and Poisson statistical model, and implemented in the SaTScan software. Information on detected clusters is disseminated daily via an online interactive mapping interface. RESULTS: The number of clusters detected tracked with the number of new cases. Slightly more than 4900 statistically significant (p ≤ 0.01) space-time clusters were detected over 14 health regions from May to October 2020. The Montréal region was the most affected. CONCLUSION: Considering the objective of timely cluster detection, the use of near-real-time health surveillance data of varying quality over time and by region constitutes an acceptable compromise between timeliness and data quality. This tool serves to supplement the epidemiologic investigations carried out by regional public health authorities for purposes of COVID-19 management and prevention.","Lebel, Germain; Fortin, Élise; Lo, Ernest; Boivin, Marie-Claude; Tandonnet, Matthieu; Gravel, Nathalie",Can J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34374036/; https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-021-00560-1,383

The COVID-19 pandemic has no contrast from previous outbreaks like SARS and MERS regarding their ensuing worries and boosted anxiety levels. This article seeks to examine the unique psychological changes that occur in students who have been quarantined inside a university campus and assess sociodemographic factors associated with certain psychological factors. Methodology: The data was collected from students in an Agricultural Campus. In the first phase, the factor structure of the modified National Index Psychological Wellness (NIPW) was acceptable, and to establish statistical parameters for validation an exploratory factor analysis was done. In the second phase, Independent T-tests, ANOVA, and Hierarchical Multiple regression were performed. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0. Result/Discussion: A total of 46 male and 76 female students enrolled in this study. The Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant (p < 0.001) and the Kaiser–Mayer–Olkin measure of sampling adequacy for the AUDIT-M was 0.901. The Cronbach's alpha of the entire modified NIPW was 0.657 which suggests reasonable internal consistency and subscales between 0.913 and 0.924. Raw scores of 12 positive items were higher for the quarantined group except for “I can do daily routines,” “I understand what happens,” and “I understand the action that is performed is fair.” Raw mean scores of eight negative scoring items were higher in the quarantined group, except for “I feel angry” (2.88 vs. 2.89 for non-quarantined group). There were statistically significant differences between year groups for the questions “I understand what happens,” “I understand the action that is performed is fair,” and “I think everyone is good.” Conclusion: Movement control orders or compulsory quarantine orders can be distressing and may cause understandable psychological sequelae. Holistic management of a quarantine center that addresses the needs and health of an individual student will give a positive impact on psychological wellness. Quarantining facilities can be a place of positivity, allowing people to live a shared experience together, provide peer support for each other, and give each other hope.","Muhamad, Assikin Bin; Pang, Nicholas Tze Ping; Salvaraji, Loganathan; Rahim, Syed Sharizman Syed Abdul; Jeffree, Mohammad Saffree; Omar, Azizan",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33967840/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.558591,383

While these studies have revealed cellular machineries that are uniquely required by individual viruses, accumulating data also indicate the presence of broadly required mechanisms. Among these overlapping cellular functions are components of intracellular membrane trafficking pathways. Here, we review recent discoveries focused on how viruses exploit intracellular membrane trafficking pathways to promote various stages of their life cycle, with an emphasis on cellular factors that are usurped by a broad range of viruses. We describe broadly required components of the endocytic and secretory pathways, the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport pathway, and the autophagy pathway.

This large genomic resource has allowed tracing of the emergence and spread of mutations and phylogenetic reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in near real time. Though, whether SARS-CoV-2 undergoes genetic recombination has been largely overlooked to date. Recombination-mediated rearrangement of variants that arose independently can be of major evolutionary importance. Moreover, the absence of recombination is a key assumption behind the application of phylogenetic inference methods. Here, we analyse the extant genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 and show that, to date, there is no detectable hallmark of recombination.

Continued safety precautions should be taken as more data become available. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a novel, global pandemic that has infected millions and, up to this point, caused more than two million fatalities worldwide. The ocular surface has become of interest as a possible vector for transmission by acting as a direct inoculation site, being a conduit for the virus into the respiratory system or as a method of transmission from potentially infected conjunctiva or tears. The components necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to theoretically infect ocular tissues are present: binding receptors (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and cluster of differentiation 147) and mechanisms for cell entry (transmembrane protease serine 2 and cathepsin L). This meta-analysis of COVID-19 prevalence data indicates that SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been infrequently found in conjunctival samples when tested with reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction.

Antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have shown good sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection in adults and are used in children despite the lack data from children. Objective. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of the PanbioTM-COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (P-RDT) in symptomatic and asymptomatic children against reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS). Design. Prospective diagnostic study from 11.2020 to 03.2021 Setting. Single-center Participants. Consecutive symptomatic and asymptomatic participants 0-16yo Intervention. Two NPS for both RT-PCR and P-RDT Main outcome. P-RDT sensitivity and specificity Results. Eight-hundred and twenty-two participants completed the study, of which 533 (64.9%) were symptomatic. Among the 119 (14.5%) RT-PCR positive patients, the overall P-RDT sensitivity was 0.66 (95%CI 0.57-0.74). Mean viral load (VL) was higher among P-RDT positive than negative ones (p<0.001). Sensitivity was 0.87 in specimens with VL>1.0E6 copies/mL (95%CI 0.87-1.00), which is the accepted cut-off for the presence of infectious virus, and decreased to 0.67 (95%CI 0.59-0.76) for specimens >1.0E3 copies/mL. Among symptomatic participants, the P-RDT displayed a sensitivity of 0.73 (95%CI 0.64-0.82), which peaked at 1.00 at 2 days post onset of symptoms (DPOS; 95%CI 1.00-1.00), then decreased to 0.56 (95%CI 0.23-0.88) at 5 DPOS. There was a trend towards lower P-RDT sensitivity in symptomatic children <12 years (0.62 [95%CI 0.45-0.78]) versus > 12 years (0.80 [95%CI 0.69-0.91]; p=0.09). VL which was significantly lower in asymptomatic participants than in symptomatic ones (p<0.001). The P-RDT displayed a sensitivity of 0.43 (95%CI 0.26-0.61). Specificity was 1.00 in symptomatic and asymptomatic children (95%CI 0.99-1.00). Conclusion and relevance. The overall respective 73% and 43% sensitivities of P-RDT in symptomatic and asymptomatic children was below the 80% cut-off recommended by the World Health Organization. These findings are likely explained by lower VLs in children at the time of diagnosis. As expected, we observed a direct correlation between VL and P-RDT sensitivity as well as variation of sensitivity according to DPOS, a major determinant of VL. These data highlight the limitations of RDTs both in symptomatic and asymptomatic children, with the potential exception in early symptomatic children >12yrs where sensitivity reached 80%.","L'Huillier, A.; Lacour, M.; Sadiku, D.; Gadiri, M.

669153,5th Generation Cellular Networks and Neurosurgery: A Narrative Review,2021,"Neuro-inflammation signaling has been identified as an important hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in addition to amyloid β plaques (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). However, our knowledge of neuro-inflammation is very limited; and the core signaling pathways associated with neuro-inflammation are missing. From a novel perspective, i.e., investigating weakly activated molecular signals (rather than the strongly activated molecular signals), in this study, we uncovered the core neuro-inflammation signaling pathways in AD. Our novel hypothesis is that weakly activated neuro-inflammation signaling pathways can cause neuro-degeneration in a chronic process; whereas, strongly activated neuro-inflammation often cause acute disease progression like in COVID-19. Using the two large-scale genomics datasets, i.e., Mayo Clinic (77 control and 81 AD samples) and RosMap (97 control and 260 AD samples), our analysis identified 7 categories of signaling pathways implicated on AD and related to virus infection: immune response, x-core signaling, apoptosis, lipid dysfunctional, biosynthesis and metabolism, and mineral absorption signaling pathways. More interestingly, most of genes in the virus infection, immune response and x-core signaling pathways, are associated with inflammation molecular functions. Specifically, the x-core signaling pathways were defined as a group of 9 signaling proteins: MAPK, Rap1, NF-kappa B, HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, Wnt, TGF-beta, Hippo and TNF, which indicated the core neuro-inflammation signaling pathways responding to the low-level and weakly activated inflammation and hypoxia, and leading to the chronic neuro-degeneration. The core neuro-inflammation signaling pathways can be used as novel therapeutic targets for effective AD treatment and prevention.","Li, Fuhai; Eteleeb, Abdallah; Buchser, William; Wang, Guoqiao; Xiong, Chengjie; Payne, Philip R.; McDade, Eric; Karch, Celeste M.; Harari, Oscar; Cruchaga, Carlos",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.30.458295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34494019/,383
669773,Acute Illness in the Athlete,2019-07-27,"We simulated epidemic projections of a potential COVID-19 outbreak in a university population of 38,000 persons, under varying combinations of mass test rate (0% to 10%), contact trace and test rate (0% to 50%), transmission rate (probability of transmission per contact per day), and contact rate (number of contacts per person per day). We simulated four levels of transmission rate, 14% (average baseline), 8% (average for face mask use), 5.4% (average for 3ft distancing), and 2.5% (average for 6ft distancing and face mask use), interpolating results to the full range to understand the impact of uncertainty in effectiveness, feasibility, and adherence of face mask use and physical distancing. We evaluated contact rates between 1 and 25, to identify the threshold that, if exceeded, could lead to several deaths. When transmission rate was 8%, for trace and test at 50%, the contact rate threshold was 8. However, any time delays in trace, test, and isolation quickly raised the number of deaths. Keeping contact rate to 3 or below was more robust to testing delays, keeping deaths below 1 up to a delay of 5 days from the time of infection to diagnosis and isolation. For a contact rate of 3, the number of trace and tests peaked to about 70 per day and relaxed to 25 with the addition of 10% mass test. When transmission rate was 5.4%, for trace and test at 50%, the contact rate threshold was 10. However, keeping contact rate to 4 or below was more robust to delays in testing, keeping deaths below 1 up to a delay of 6 days from the time of infection to diagnosis and isolation. For contact rate of 4, the number of trace and tests peaked at 50 per day and relaxed to 10 per day with the addition of 10% mass test. Threshold estimates can help develop on-campus scheduling and indoor-spacing plans in conjunction with plans for asymptomatic testing for COVID-19. Combination thresholds should be selected specific to the setting based on an assessment of the feasibility and resource 48 availability for testing and quarantine.","Zhao, X.; Tatapudi, H.

The United States of America ranked the first in terms of the number of relevant studies published. China attaches great importance to the prevention and control of infectious diseases, but still needs to improve in the following areas: for example, insufficient Science Citation Index reports on particular pathogens, institutions SCI reports on pathogens lower than world top pathogen research institutions, and lack of influential international pathogen-related journals.

This virus, which targets the lungs in particular, can also damage other tissues. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) plays a key role in viral entry into host cells. The presence of ACE-2 in various tissues may permit viral infection. Studies of COVID-19 often make use of postmortem tissues. Although this information provides various useful results, it is also necessary to conduct in vitro studies to understand optimal treatment approaches. Because the virus may show species-specific differences, in vitro technologies using human cells are particularly important. Organoid technologies, three-dimensional structures that can be obtained from human cells, are playing increasingly important roles in studies of SARS-CoV-2. This technology offers a significant advantage in terms of mimicking in vivo tissue structures and testing antiviral compounds. In this mini-review, we summarize studies of SARS-CoV-2 using both histopathological and organoid technology approaches.","İnanç, İrem; Erdemli, Esra",J Int Med Res,https://doi.org/10.1177/03000605211044382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34521239/,383

In this viewpoint we provide insights concerning how health care professionals can unintentionally shift the novel coronavirus type to more drug-resistant forms. It is worth noting that viruses usually have different sensitivities to physical and chemical damaging agents such antiviral drugs, UV and heat ranging from extremely sensitive (ES) to extremely resistant (ER) based on a bell-shaped curve. Given this consideration, the widespread infection of people with such ER viruses would be a real disaster. Here, we introduce a modified treatment method for COVID-19-associated pneumonia. In this proposed method, COVID-19 patients will receive a single dose of 100, 180 or 250 mSv X-ray radiation that is less than the maximum annual radiation dose of the residents of high background radiation areas of Ramsar that is up to 260 mSv. In contrast with antiviral drugs, a single dose of either 100, 180 or 250 mSv of low LET X-rays cannot exert a significant selective pressure on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and hence does not lead to directed accelerated evolution of these viruses. Moreover, Low Dose Radiation (LDR) has the capacity of modulating excessive inflammatory responses, regulating lymphocyte counts, and controling bacterial co-infections in patients with COVID-19.","A., Ghadimi-Moghadam; M., Haghani; J.

However, mechanisms underlying OT regulation of maternal behavior and its association with immunity around parturition, particularly under mental and physical stress, remain unclear. Here, we observed effects of OT on maternal behavior in association with immunological activity in rats after cesarean delivery (CD), a model of reproductive stress. CD significantly reduced maternal interests to the pups throughout postpartum day 1-8. On postpartum day 5, CD decreased plasma OT levels and thymic index but increased vasopressin, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 levels. CD had no significant effect on plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone levels. In the hypothalamus, CD decreased corticotropin-releasing hormone contents in the PVN but increased OT contents in the PVN and SON and OT release from hypothalamic implants. CD also increased c-Fos expression, particularly in the cytoplasm of OT neurons. Lastly, CD depolarized resting membrane potential and increased spike width while increasing the variability of the firing rate of OT neurons in brain slices. Thus, CD can increase hypothalamic OT contents and release but reduce pituitary release of OT into the blood, which is associated with depressive-like maternal behavior, increased inflammatory cytokine release and decreased relative weight of the thymus.","Li, Tong; Jia, Shu-Wei; Hou, Dan; Wang, Xiaoran; Li, Dongyang; Liu, Yang; Cui, Dan; Liu, Xiaoyu; Hou, Chun-Mei; Wang, Ping; Brown, Colin H.; Wang, Yu-Feng",ASN Neuro,https://doi.org/10.1177/17590914211014731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34210188/,383

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study to assess the virus-specific antibody and memory T and B cell responses in COVID-19 patients up to 343 days after infection. Neutralizing antibodies and antibodies against the receptor-binding domain, spike, and nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 were measured. Virus-specific memory T and B cell responses were analyzed. RESULTS: We enrolled 59 COVID-19 patients, including 38 moderate, 16 mild, and five asymptomatic patients; 31 (52.5%) were men, and 28 (47.5%) were women. The median age was 41 (interquartile range [IQR]: 30–55). The median day from symptom onset to enrollment was 317 days (range 257 to 343 days). We found that approximately 90% of patients still have detectable IgG antibodies against spike and nucleocapsid proteins and neutralizing antibodies against pseudovirus, whereas ~60% of patients had detectable IgG antibodies against receptor binding domain and surrogate virus-neutralizing antibodies. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG (+) memory B cell and IFN-γ secreting T cell responses were detectable in over 70% of patients.

673600,Update on COVID-19 Myocarditis,2020-12-09,"AIM: People diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disorder often contend with a threat to independence and control, leading some to complete an advance care plan. Advance care plans are commonly associated with treatment limitations; however, key patient agents (such as doctors, allied health, nurses and family) may instead make temporal, best interests or good medical practice decisions on behalf of the patient. Accordingly, there is a need to better understand ancillary decision-maker’s perspectives, particularly of doctors. PURPOSE: To explain how the potentially conflicting interests of bedside patient agents operates as a factor which influences doctors’ application of advance care plans of people with a neurodegenerative disorder. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Using a constructivist grounded theory informed thematic analysis, 38 semi-structured interviews were conducted with hospital-based doctors, allied health, nurses and family of people with a neurodegenerative disorder who had an advance care plan. Data were inductively analysed using open and focused coding. RESULTS: Analysis revealed two main themes: dynamics of discerning best interests; and avoiding conflict. Rather than applying advance care plans, doctors largely involved families to attempt best interests decision-making partnerships on patients’ behalf. Bedside agents demonstrated significant intra and interpersonal challenges associated with their roles as patient agents. Doctors appeared protective of families and patients with neurodegenerative disorder. CONCLUSION: Although bedside agents value advance care plans, doctors often favour temporal healthcare decisions in consultation with family. We suggest there are limitations to the effectiveness of advance care plans in practice, with application typically only occurring close to death. Despite the intentions of advance care planning, bedside agents may still experience considerable dissonance.","Craig, Denise P; Ray, Robin; Harvey, Desley; Shircore, Mandy",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34393488/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s314664,383

Moreover, the use of ultrasonic scalers, air-water syringes, and slow and high-speed handpieces, which are common in the dental office, generate spatter and aerosol.

Although some mouthrinses demonstrates an antiviral effect, there is limited evidence about the clinical efficacy of any mouthrinse in the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the dental aerosol. We hypothesized that mouthrinses may reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the oropharynx and its fluids reducing viral load in dental aerosol. The potential use of mouthrinses is discussed, along with proposal of in vitro and clinical studies, in order to evaluate this hypothesis. If this hypothesis holds true, dental professionals and patients may benefit from the routine use of preprocedural mouthrinses.","Reis Reis INR, Isabella N R; do Amaral Amaral GCLS, Guilherme Castro Lima Silva; André Huamán Mendoza Mendoza AAH, Aldrin; Teixeira das Graças Graças YT, Yasmin; Cássia Mendes-Correa Mendes-Correa MC, Maria; Alexandre Romito Romito GA, Giuseppe; Mendes Pannuti Pannuti CM, Claudio",Med Hypotheses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33288313/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720333272; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720333272?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110436,383

In press Is It Always Correct to Continue Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibitors in the COVID-19 Era?",2020-04-24,"BACKGROUND: Tools for shared decision-making (e.g. decision aids) are intended to support health care professionals and patients engaged in clinical encounters involving shared decision-making. However, decision aids are hard to produce, and onerous to update. Consequently, they often do not reflect best current evidence, and show limited uptake in practice. In response, we initiated the Sharing Evidence to Inform Treatment decisions (SHARE-IT) project. Our goal was to develop and refine a new generation of decision aids that are generically produced along digitally structured guidelines and evidence summaries. METHODS: Applying principles of human-centred design and following the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) and GRADE methods for trustworthy evidence summaries we developed a decision aid prototype in collaboration with the Developing and Evaluating Communication strategies to support Informed Decisions and practice based on Evidence project (DECIDE). We iteratively user-tested the prototype in clinical consultations between clinicians and patients. Semi-structured interviews of participating clinicians and patients were conducted. Qualitative content analysis of both user-testing sessions and interviews was performed and results categorized according to a revised Morville’s framework of user-experience. We made it possible to produce, publish and use these decision aids in an electronic guideline authoring and publication platform (MAGICapp). RESULTS: Direct observations and analysis of user-testing of 28 clinical consultations between physicians and patients informed four major iterations that addressed readability, understandability, usability and ways to cope with information overload. Participants reported that the tool supported natural flow of the conversation and induced a positive shift in consultation habits towards shared decision-making. We integrated the functionality of SHARE-IT decision aids in MAGICapp, which has since generated numerous decision aids. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a proof of concept that encounter decision aids can be generically produced from GRADE evidence summaries and clinical guidelines. Online authoring and publication platforms can help scale up production including continuous updating of electronic encounter decision aids, fully integrated with evidence summaries and clinical practice guidelines.

677068,Malaria Endemicity Influence on COVID -19 Mortality: New Evidence Added to BCG and TB Prevalence,2020-09-11,"OBJECTIVES: To propose the optimal timing to consider tracheostomy insertion for weaning of mechanically ventilated patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. We investigated the relationship between duration of mechanical ventilation prior to tracheostomy insertion and in-hospital mortality. In addition, we present a machine learning approach to facilitate decision-making. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Guy’s & St Thomas’ Hospital, London, United Kingdom. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 requiring mechanical ventilation between March 3, 2020, and May 5, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Baseline characteristics and temporal trends in markers of disease severity were prospectively recorded. Tracheostomy was performed for anticipated prolonged ventilatory wean when levels of respiratory support were favorable. Decision tree was constructed using C4.5 algorithm, and its classification performance has been evaluated by a leave-one-out cross-validation technique. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One-hundred seventy-six patients required mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure, of which 87 patients (49.4%) underwent tracheostomy. We identified that optimal timing for tracheostomy insertion is between day 13 and day 17. Presence of fibrosis on CT scan (odds ratio, 13.26; 95% CI [3.61–48.91]; p ≤ 0.0001) and Pao(2):Fio(2) ratio (odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI [0.95–0.99]; p = 0.008) were independently associated with tracheostomy insertion. Cox multiple regression analysis showed that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (hazard ratio, 6.56; 95% CI [1.04–41.59]; p = 0.046), ischemic heart disease (hazard ratio, 4.62; 95% CI [1.19–17.87]; p = 0.027), positive end-expiratory pressure (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% CI [1.02–1.57]; p = 0.034), Pao(2):Fio(2) ratio (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI [0.97–0.99]; p = 0.003), and C-reactive protein (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI [1–1.01]; p = 0.005) were independent late predictors of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the optimal window for consideration of tracheostomy for ventilatory weaning is between day 13 and 17. Late predictors of mortality may serve as adverse factors when considering tracheostomy, and our decision tree provides a degree of decision support for clinicians.","Takhar, Arunjit; Surda, Pavol; Ahmad, Imran; Amin, Nikul; Arora, Asit; Camporota, Luigi; Denniston, Poppy; El-Boghdadly, Kariem; Kvassay, Miroslav; Macekova, Denisa; Munk, Michal; Ranford, David; Rabcan, Jan; Tornari, Chysostomos; Wyncoll, Duncan; Zaitseva, Elena; Hart, Nicholas; Tricklebank, Stephen",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33225305/; https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000279,383

To further clarify the factors influencing their behaviours, this study used a questionnaire to survey a sample of 556 individuals in China and used multiple linear regression and analysis of variance to explore influencing factors during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We found that, first, in the COVID-19 pandemic, middle-aged and elderly adults’ willingness to re-spread rumours is positively related to their degree of believing rumours and to personal anxiety and is negatively related to their rumour-discrimination ability and to their perception of serious consequences to rumour spreading. Second, the degree of believing rumours plays an intermediary role in the willingness to re-spread rumours. It plays a partial mediating role in the path of anxiety’s influence on behaviour, suggesting that an anxious person will spread a rumour even if he or she does not have a strong belief in the rumour. Third, interpersonal communication has a greater credibility and a greater willingness to re-spread than does mass communication. This suggests the importance of increasing public knowledge expertise and of reducing public panic. This also has important implications for the future design of public health policies.","Sun, Zhonggen; Cheng, Xin; Zhang, Ruilian; Yang, Bingqing",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911826/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186542,383

Here we report a comprehensive comparison of human MSCs derived from umbilical cord Wharton’s jelly (UC-MSCs), dental pulp (PU-MSCs), and adipose tissue (AD-MSCs) on the treatment of glucose and lipid metabolic disorders in type II diabetic mice. METHODS: Fourteen-to-fifteen-week-old male C57BL/6 db/db mice were intravenously administered with human UC-MSCs, PU-MSCs, and AD-MSCs at various doses or vehicle control once every 2 weeks for 6 weeks. Metformin (MET) was given orally to animals in a separate group once a day at weeks 4 to 6 as a positive control. Body weight, blood glucose, and insulin levels were measured every week. Glucose tolerance tests (GTT) and insulin tolerance tests (ITT) were performed every 2 weeks. All the animals were sacrificed at week 6 and the blood and liver tissues were collected for biochemical and histological examinations. RESULTS: UC-MSCs showed the strongest efficacy in reducing fasting glucose levels, increasing fasting insulin levels, and improving GTT and ITT in a dose-dependent manner, whereas PU-MSCs showed an intermediate efficacy and AD-MSCs showed the least efficacy on these parameters. Moreover, UC-MSCs also reduced the serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels with the most prominent potency and AD-MSCs had only very weak effect on LDL-C. In contrast, AD-MSCs substantially reduced the lipid content and histological lesion of liver and accompanying biomarkers of liver injury such as serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, whereas UC-MSCs and PU-MSCs displayed no or modest effects on these parameters, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results demonstrated that MSCs of different tissue origins can confer substantially different therapeutic efficacy in ameliorating glucose and lipid metabolic disorders in type II diabetes. MSCs with different therapeutic characteristics could be selected according to the purpose of the treatment in the future clinical practice.","Ma, Yinzhong; Wang, Lisha; Yang, Shilun; Liu, Dongyu; Zeng, Yi; Lin, Lilong; Qiu, Linhui; Lu, Jiahao; Chang, Junlei; Li, Zhihuan",Stem Cell Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34233739/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-021-02463-x,383

Both have been studied extensively, yet there currently is no rapid or succinct tool that can be used in the emergency department to screen for either, or a consensus of evidence-based ways to correct these issues. This is of concern because both loneliness and social isolation have been linked to poor health. Poor health, in turn, can lead to worse isolation and loneliness. These health problems may lead to the older adult seeking care in the emergency department where screening and initial treatment could be initiated. Suggestions for questions that emergency nurses can ask to identify an older adult who is lonely or suffers from social isolation, as well as steps to consider when encountering the older adult with complaints of loneliness and/or social isolation, are provided, with the realization that these are only the first steps of many that would need to be taken.

Methods We performed a retrospective, single-center analysis of 84 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan Union Hospital, China, from January 19 through February 7, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Blood samples were analyzed for white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and in some cases, immunoglobulins, complement, lymphocyte subsets, and cytokines. Virus RNA was detected in stool samples by real-time PCR. Results Of the 84 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 26 (31%) had diarrhea. The duration of fever and dyspnea in patients with diarrhea was significantly longer than those without diarrhea (all P<.05). Stool samples from a higher proportion of patients with diarrhea tested positive for virus RNA (69%) than from patients without diarrhea (17%) (P<.001). As of February 19, a lower proportion of patients with diarrhea had a negative result from the latest throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 (77%) than patients without diarrhea (97%) (P=.010), during these patients’ hospitalization. Of 76 patients with a negative result from their latest throat swab test during hospitalization, a significantly higher proportion of patients with diarrhea had a positive result from the retest for SARS-CoV-2 in stool (45%) than patients without diarrhea (20%) (P=.039).

Medical therapy was classified into two phases in our guideline. In the initial phase, workload or patients' visit was to be reduced without impairing disease control and survival. In the successive phase under restriction of medical resources, only therapies with higher priority and alternate therapies were to be practiced. Whereas no significant effect on medical practice was observed during first wave pandemic, actual impact was evaluated in this study. Methods: Among patients in our division from April to May 2020, cases of treatment change, postponement of treatment introduction, treatment interruption, long-term prescription, telephone consultation, postponement of visit, reference to other hospital, and COVID-19 diagnosis were retrospectively searched from medical records. Results: There were estimated 984 patients, 389 perioperative and 595 metastatic, of whom 119(12%) were affected by COVID-19. The breakdown is 7 cases of treatment changes, 7 cases of postponements of introduction, 20 cases of interruptions, 12 cases of long-term prescriptions of oral chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapy, 36 cases of prescriptions by telephone consultation, 94 cases of postponements of visit, 3 cases of reference to other hospital, and 4 cases of fever for which COVID-19 infection could not be denied. Conclusion: 12% of patients in the division of medical oncology at the breast center changed their treatment or schedule of visit. Treatment change that could affect breast cancer survival were 2 cases of cancellation of adjuvant chemotherapy.

We designed subunit vaccine candidates using self-assembling ferritin nanoparticles displaying one of two multimerized SARS-CoV-2 spikes: full-length ectodomain (S-Fer) or a C-terminal 70 amino-acid deletion (SΔC-Fer). Ferritin is an attractive nanoparticle platform for production of vaccines, and ferritin-based vaccines have been investigated in humans in two separate clinical trials. We confirmed proper folding and antigenicity of spike on the surface of ferritin by cryo-EM and binding to conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies. After a single immunization of mice with either of the two spike ferritin particles, a lentiviral SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay revealed mean neutralizing antibody titers at least 2-fold greater than those in convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients. Additionally, a single dose of SΔC-Fer elicited significantly higher neutralizing responses as compared to immunization with the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) monomer or spike ectodomain trimer alone. After a second dose, mice immunized with SΔC-Fer exhibited higher neutralizing titers than all other groups. Taken together, these results demonstrate that multivalent presentation of SARS-CoV-2 spike on ferritin can notably enhance elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, thus constituting a viable strategy for single-dose vaccination against COVID-19.","Powell, Abigail E.; Zhang, Kaiming; Sanyal, Mrinmoy; Tang, Shaogeng; Weidenbacher, Payton A.; Li, Shanshan; Pham, Tho D.; Pak, John E.; Chiu, Wah; Kim, Peter S.",ACS Cent Sci,https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.0c01405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527087/,383

Due to its wide range of applications (e.g. autonomous driving, Internet-of-Things), it has gained much focus from the industry and academia. Channel State Information (CSI) has overtaken Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to achieve localization given its temporal stability and rich information. In this paper, we extend our previous work by combining classical and deep learning methods in an attempt to improve the localization accuracy using CSI. We then test the generalization aspect of both approaches in different environments by splitting the training and test sets such that their intersection is reduced when compared with uniform random splitting. The deep learning approach is a Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP NN) and the classical machine learning method is based on K-nearest neighbors (KNN). The estimation results of both approaches outperform state-of-the-art performance on the same dataset. We illustrate that while the accuracy of both approaches deteriorates when tested for generalization, deep learning exhibits a higher potential to perform better beyond the training set.

The subgroup analysis suggested that the carrier of G in rs4804803 was a risk factor for severe dengue under dominant (GG/GA versus AA: OR = 1.86,95%CI, 1.01–3.45), superdominant (GA versus GG/AA: OR = 1.81,95%CI, 1.02–3.21) and a codominant (GA versus AA: OR=1.82,95%CI, 1.02–3.26) models in Asians, while it was a protective factor for severe dengue in South-central Americans under recessive (GG versus GA/AA: OR = 0.27,95%CI, 0.10–0.70) and codominant (GG versus AA: OR=0.24,95%CI, 0.09–0.64) models. The results from subgroup analysis were robust. Conclusions: Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) promoter-336G/A (rs4804803) polymorphism is association with severe dengue, and it acts in different directions for Asians and South-central Americans.","Ren, Jiangping; Wang, Zhengting; Chen, Enfu",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027310/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16081475,383
683700,Management of Tracheostomy during COVID-19 Outbreak: Heat and Moisture Exchanger Filter and Closed Suctioning System,2020-05-07,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare disease of the pulmonary vasculature, characterised pathologically by proliferation, remodelling and thrombosis in situ. Unfortunately, existing therapeutic interventions do not reverse these findings and the disease continues to result in significant morbidity and premature mortality. A number of haematological derangements have been described in pulmonary arterial hypertension which may provide insights into the pathobiology of the disease and opportunities to explore new therapeutic pathways. These include quantitative and qualitative platelet abnormalities, such as thrombocytopaenia, increased mean platelet volume and altered platelet bioenergetics. Furthermore, a hypercoagulable state and aberrant negative regulatory pathways can be observed, which could contribute to thrombosis in situ in distal pulmonary arteries and arterioles. Finally, there is increasing interest in the role of extracellular vesicle autocrine and paracrine signalling in pulmonary arterial hypertension, and their potential utility as biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets. This review focuses on the potential role of platelets, extracellular vesicles and coagulation pathways in the pathobiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension. We highlight important unanswered clinical questions and the implications of these observations for future research and pulmonary arterial hypertension-directed therapies.","Cullivan, Sarah; Murphy, Claire A.; Weiss, Luisa; Comer, Shane P.; Kevane, Barry; McCullagh, Brian; Maguire, Patricia B.; Ní Ainle, Fionnuala; Gaine, Sean P.",Pulm Circ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34158919/; https://doi.org/10.1177/20458940211021036,383

684059,Validation of a manual of care plans for people hospitalized with COVID‐19,2021-05-06,"Background: In a viral epidemic, the emergence of a novel strain with increased transmissibility (larger value of basic reproduction number R0) sparks the fear that the increase in transmissibility is likely to lead to an increase in disease severity. It is required to investigate if a new, more contagious strain will be necessarily dominant in the population and resulting in more disease severity. Methods: The impact of the asymptomatic transmission and the emergence time of a more transmissible variant of a multi-strain viral disease on the disease prevalence, disease severity, and the dominant variant in an epidemic was investigated by a proposed 2-strain epidemic model, called 2-SEICARD model, that is an extension of the SEIRD model. Results: The simulation results showed that considering only R0, is insufficient to predict the outcome of a new, more contagious strain in the population. A more transmissible strain with a high fraction of asymptomatic cases can substantially reduce the mortality rate. If the emergence time of the new strain is closer to the start of the epidemic, the new, more contagious variant has more chance to win the viral competition and be the dominant strain; otherwise, despite being more contagious, it cannot dominate previous strains. Conclusions: Three factors of R0, the fraction of asymptomatic transmission, and the emergence time of the new strain are required to correctly determine the prevalence, disease severity, and the winner of the viral competition.","Alizad-Rahvar, A.

684416,Letter to the Editor regarding article “Electrocardiographic markers of increased risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia”,2021-07-21,"This paper presents an exploratory study of the posting behavior of digital influencers in social participation platforms. As there are different platforms of social participation, we present a taxonomy to unify the different classifications and delimit the scope of our work. Influencers could produce a positive externality of increasing participation by suggesting social causes and government actions they believe in. However, influencers tend to restrict their posts to the domain subject they became popular for. Our goal is to identify the cost structure of posting behavior of influencers, from the desire to post to the actual act of posting. The findings indicate the two key factors influencers consider when posting are (a) the risk of losing followers and (b) the effort required to verify the information. On the other hand, followers indicate they like it when influencers voice their opinion on social causes. These findings are anchored on social influence theory. We also found different factors that motivate/demotivate people to post on social media. We noticed that the factors that will motivate a user to post can either be aroused in him (i.e., already internalized in the person) or can be “planted” in the person (i.e., from outside).","Oliveira, Carlos; Garcia, Ana Cristina B; Vivacqua, Adriana S",Pers Ubiquitous Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33495698/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00779-020-01502-3,383

DESIGN: A prospective, single-centre feasibility study. STUDY SAMPLE: First-time hearing aid users (n = 59), recruited at their initial hearing assessment. Evaluations were made at 1-week and at 10–12 weeks post-hearing aid fitting. RESULTS: m2Hear was most commonly accessed via tablets (42.3%). Usability was high for the System Usability Scale (88.5%), and the uMARS, particularly for the Information (M = 4.7), Functionality (M = 4.5) and Aesthetics (M = 4.2) subscales (maximum score = 5). Participant feedback was positive, with a high percent agreeing that m2Hear aided understanding of hearing aids (98%), held their interest (86%), improved confidence to use hearing aids and communicate (84%), and provided additional information to audiologist’s advice (82%). Learnings about practical hearing aid handling/maintenance skills and how to communicate with others were reportedly used equally in participant’s everyday lives. m2Hear was convenient to use, clear, concise and comprehensive.

If the medical scientific publication system has promptly reacted to this new situation, other domains, particularly in new technologies, struggle to map what is happening in their contexts. The pandemic has created the need for a rapid detection of technological convergence phenomena, but at the same time it has made clear that this task is impossible on the basis of traditional patent and publication indicators. This paper presents a novel methodology to perform a rapid detection of the fast technological convergence phenomenon that is occurring under the pressure of the Covid-19 pandemic. The fast detection has been performed thanks to the use of a novel source: the online blogging platform Medium. We demonstrate that the hybrid structure of this social journalism platform allows a rapid detection of innovation phenomena, unlike other traditional sources. The technological convergence phenomenon has been modelled through a network-based approach, analysing the differences of networks computed during two time periods (pre and post COVID-19). The results led us to discuss the repurposing of technologies regarding “Remote Control”, “Remote Working”, “Health” and “Remote Learning”.","Melluso, Nicola; Bonaccorsi, Andrea; Chiarello, Filippo; Fantoni, Gualtiero",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244175; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00197v1.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33382727/,383
684750,Could Statins Do More Than Lower Cholesterol in Patients With COVID-19?,2021,"Background and Objectives: The Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 mRNA vaccine has demonstrated excellent efficacy and safety in phase 3 trials. However, no dialyzed patients were included, and therefore safety data for this patient group is lacking. The aim of the study was to assess the safety and tolerances of vaccinations with BNT162b2 performed in chronically dialyzed patients. Materials and Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study including a group of 190 dialyzed patients (65% male) at median age 68.0 (55–74) years. 169 (89.0%) patients were treated with hemodialysis and 21 (11.0%) with peritoneal dialysis. The control group consisted of 160 people (61% male) without chronic kidney disease at median age 63 (range 53–77) years. Both groups were vaccinated with BNT162b2 with a 21-day interval between the first and the second dose. Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity, unsolicited adverse events and antipyretic and pain medication use were assessed with a standardized questionnaire. The toxicity grading scales were derived from the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research guidelines. Results: 59.8% (dose 1), 61.4% (dose 2) and 15.9% (dose 1), 29.4% (dose 2) dialyzed patients reported at least one local and one systemic reaction respectively within seven days after the vaccination. Many local and systemic solicited reactions were observed less frequently in dialyzed patients than in the age and sex matched control group and much less frequently than reported in the pivotal study. They were mostly mild to moderate, short-lived, and more frequently reported in younger individuals and women. No related unsolicited adverse events were observed. Conclusions: We have shown here that BNT162b2, an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against SARS-COV-2 is safe and well-tolerated by dialyzed patients. The results can be useful for the nephrological community to resolve patients’ doubts and reduce their vaccine hesitancy.","Polewska, Karolina; Tylicki, Piotr; Biedunkiewicz, Bogdan; Rucińska, Angelika; Szydłowska, Aleksandra; Kubanek, Alicja; Rosenberg, Iwona; Rodak, Sylwia; Ślizień, Waldemar; Renke, Marcin; Dębska-Ślizień, Alicja; Tylicki, Leszek",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34357013/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57070732,383

685611,Impact of COVID-19 on the performance of a radiation oncology department at a major comprehensive cancer centre in Poland during the first ten weeks of the epidemic,2020-08-16,"Proinflammatory cytokine production following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Like SARS CoV-1, SARS CoV-2 enters host cells via its spike protein, which attaches to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). As SARS CoV-1 spike protein is reported to induce cytokine production, we hypothesized that this pathway could be a shared mechanism underlying pathogenic immune responses. We herein compared the capabilities of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), SARS CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 spike proteins to induce cytokine expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We observed that only specific commercial lots of SARS CoV-2 induce cytokine production. Surprisingly, recombinant SARS CoV-2 spike proteins from different vendors and batches exhibited different patterns of cytokine induction, and these activities were not inhibited by blockade of spike protein-ACE2 binding using either soluble ACE2 or neutralizing anti-S1 antibody. Moreover, commercial spike protein reagents contained varying levels of endotoxin, which correlated directly with their abilities to induce cytokine production. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhibitor, polymyxin B, blocked this cytokine induction activity. In addition, SARS CoV-2 spike protein avidly bound soluble LPS in vitro, rendering it a cytokine inducer. These results not only suggest caution in monitoring the purity of SARS CoV-2 spike protein reagents, but they indicate the possibility that interactions of SARS CoV-2 spike protein with LPS from commensal bacteria in virally infected mucosal tissues could promote pathogenic inflammatory cytokine production.","Ouyang, Weiming; Xie, Tao; Fang, Hui; Gao, Chunling; Stantchev, Tzanko; Clouse, Kathleen A.; Yuan, Kun; Ju, Tongzhong; Frucht, David M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.26.445843,383
685941,From asymptomatic to critical illness different clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in Children,2021,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to estimate the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the general population of Iran. METHODS: The target population was all Iranian people aged 6 years and older in the country. A stratified random sampling design was used to select 28 314 people from among the individuals registered in the electronic health record systems used in primary health care in Iran. Venous blood was taken from each participant and tested for the IgG antibody against COVID-19. The prevalence of COVID-19 was estimated at provincial and national levels after adjusting for the measurement error of the laboratory test, non-response bias and sampling design. RESULTS: Of the 28 314 Iranians selected, 11 256 (39.75%) participated in the study. Of these, 5406 (48.0%) were male and 6851 (60.9%) lived in urban areas. The mean (standard deviation) participant age was 35.89 (18.61) years. The adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 until 20 August 2020 was estimated as 14.2% (95% uncertainty interval 13.3%–15.2%), which was equal to 11 958 346 (95% CI 11 211 011–12 746 776) individuals. The adjusted prevalences of infection were 14.6%, 13.8%, 16.6%, 11.7% and 19.4% among men, women, urban population, rural population and individuals aged 60 years or more, respectively. Ardabil, Golestan and Khuzestan provinces had the highest prevalence and Alborz, Hormozgan and Kerman provinces had the lowest. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the study results, a large proportion of the Iranian population had not yet been infected by COVID-19.

Cell cultures were inoculated with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), feline enteric coronavirus (FECV)_or sham inoculum. The tissue samples of liver, kidney and spleen were taken from specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats that were inoculated intranasally with 103 TCID50 of FIPV 79-1146 (n = 10), FIPV UCD1 (n = 3) or sham inoculum (n = 3), from clinical cats (n = 43), and from formalin-fixed archived feline tissues (n = 49), respectively. Additional tissue samples were taken from the FIPV-inoculated cats (n = 6) and were kept at 4°C, room temperatures (20–24°C) and 37°C respectively for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours before frozen (−70°C) for PCR to evaluate the effects of the ambient temperatures and post-mortem intervals on the test. The samples were also fixed in 10% neutrally buffered formalin, 95% ethanol, and Bouin's solution respectively to evaluate the effects of the fixatives on the test. Positive PCR results were obtained from the cell cultures that were inoculated with FIPV and FECV and from the FIPV-inoculated cats (13/13).

686660,Perspective: cardiovascular disease and the Covid-19 pandemic,2020-04-10,"Objective: The largest pandemic in history, the COVID-19 pandemic, has been declared a doomsday globally. The second wave spreading worldwide has devastating consequences in every sector of life. Several measures to contain and curb its infection have forged significant challenges for the education community. With an estimated 1.6 billion learners, the closure of schools and other educational institutions has impacted more than 90% of students worldwide from the elementary to tertiary level. Methods: In a view to studying impacts on student’s fraternity, this article aims at addressing alternative ways of educating—more specifically, online education—through the analysis of Google trends for the past year. The study analyzed the platforms of online teaching and learning systems that have been enabling remote learning, thereby limiting the impact on the education system. Thorough text analysis is performed on an existing dataset from Kaggle to retrieve insight on the clustering of words that are more often looked at during this pandemic to find the general patterns of their occurrence. Findings: The results show that the coronavirus patients are the most trending patterns in word search clustering, with the education system being at the control and preventive measures to bring equilibrium in the system of education. There has been significant growth in online platforms in the last year. Existing assets of educational establishments have effectively converted conventional education into new-age online education with the help of virtual classes and other key online tools in this continually fluctuating scholastic setting. The effective usage of teaching tools such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, and WebEx are the most used online platforms for the conduction of classes, and whiteboard software tools and learning apps such as Vedantu, Udemy, Byju’s, and Whitehat Junior have been big market players in the education system over the pandemic year, especially in India. Conclusions: The article helps to draw a holistic approach of ongoing online teaching-learning methods during the lockdown and also highlights changes that took place in the conventional education system amid the COVID pandemic to overcome the persisting disruption in academic activities and to ensure correct perception towards the online procedure as a normal course of action in the new educational system. To fill in the void of classroom learning and to minimize the virus spread over the last year, digital learning in various schools and colleges has been emphasized, leading to a significant increase in the usage of whiteboard software platforms.","Kansal, Ashwani Kumar; Gautam, Jyoti; Chintalapudi, Nalini; Jain, Shivani; Battineni, Gopi",Infect Dis Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34065817/; https://doi.org/10.3390/idr13020040,383

687042,COVID-19 Disease and its Electrocardiographic Manifestations: Our Experience,2021-04-16,"As of December 14, 2020, children and adolescents aged <18 years have accounted for 10.2% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reported in the United States.* Mitigation strategies to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, among persons of all ages, are important for pandemic control. Characterization of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among children and adolescents can inform efforts by parents, school and program administrators, and public health officials to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To assess school, community, and close contact exposures associated with pediatric COVID-19, a case-control study was conducted to compare exposures reported by parents or guardians of children and adolescents aged <18 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (case-patients) with exposures reported among those who received negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results (control participants). Among 397 children and adolescents investigated, in-person school or child care attendance ≤14 days before the SARS-CoV-2 test was reported for 62% of case-patients and 68% of control participants and was not associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.5-1.3). Among 236 children aged ≥2 years who attended child care or school during the 2 weeks before SARS-CoV-2 testing, parents of 64% of case-patients and 76% of control participants reported that their child and all staff members wore masks inside the facility (aOR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.8). In the 2 weeks preceding SARS-CoV-2 testing, case-patients were more likely to have had close contact with a person with known COVID-19 (aOR = 3.2, 95% CI = 2.0-5.0), have attended gatherings† with persons outside their household, including social functions (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.1-5.5) or activities with other children (aOR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.3-8.4), or have had visitors in the home (aOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2-2.9) than were control participants. Close contacts with persons with COVID-19 and gatherings contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infections in children and adolescents.

687326,Neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 and possible pathogenic mechanisms: Insights from other coronaviruses,2020-08-12,"Despite its overwhelming clinical importance, the SARS-CoV-2 gene set remains unresolved, hindering dissection of COVID-19 biology. Here, we use comparative genomics to provide a high-confidence protein-coding gene set, characterize protein-level and nucleotide-level evolutionary constraint, and prioritize functional mutations from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We select 44 complete Sarbecovirus genomes at evolutionary distances ideally-suited for protein-coding and non-coding element identification, create whole-genome alignments, and quantify protein-coding evolutionary signatures and overlapping constraint. We find strong protein-coding signatures for all named genes and for 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, and also ORF3c, a novel alternate-frame gene. By contrast, ORF10, and overlapping-ORFs 9c, 3b, and 3d lack protein-coding signatures or convincing experimental evidence and are not protein-coding. Furthermore, we show no other protein-coding genes remain to be discovered. Cross-strain and within-strain evolutionary pressures largely agree at the gene, amino-acid, and nucleotide levels, with some notable exceptions, including fewer-than-expected mutations in nsp3 and Spike subunit S1, and more-than-expected mutations in Nucleocapsid. The latter also shows a cluster of amino-acid-changing variants in otherwise-conserved residues in a predicted B-cell epitope, which may indicate positive selection for immune avoidance. Several Spike-protein mutations, including D614G, which has been associated with increased transmission, disrupt otherwise-perfectly-conserved amino acids, and could be novel adaptations to human hosts. The resulting high-confidence gene set and evolutionary-history annotations provide valuable resources and insights on COVID-19 biology, mutations, and evolution.","Jungreis, Irwin; Sealfon, Rachel; Kellis, Manolis",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-80345/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024961/,383

In restarting economic activities, successive outbreaks by new variants are concerning. Here, we evaluated the applicability of public database annotations to estimate the virulence, transmission trends and origins of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Among the detectable multiple mutations, we retraced the mutation in the spike protein. With the aid of the protein database, structural modelling yielded a testable scientific hypothesis on viral entry to host cells. Simultaneously, annotations for locations and collection dates suggested that the variant virus emerged somewhere in the world in approximately February 2020, entered the USA and propagated nationwide with periodic sampling fluctuation likely due to an approximately 5-day incubation delay. Thus, public database annotations are useful for automated elucidation of the early spreading patterns in relation to human behaviours, which should provide objective reference for local governments for social decision making to contain emerging substrains. We propose that additional annotations for past paths and symptoms of the patients should further assist in characterizing the exact virulence and origins of emerging pathogens.","Nakashima, Akiko; Takeya, Mitsue; Kuba, Keiji; Takano, Makoto; Nakashima, Noriyuki",Inform Med Unlocked,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052312/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235291482030592X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S235291482030592X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2020.100442,383

We report on the extent of testing and test results during the month of March in NYS, along with risk factors, outcomes, and household prevalence among initial cases subject to in-depth investigations. METHODS: Specimen collection for COVID-19 testing was conducted in healthcare settings, community-based collection sites, and by home testing teams. Information on demographics, risk factors, and hospital outcomes of cases was obtained through epidemiological investigations and an electronic medical records match, and summarized descriptively. Active testing of initial case’s households enabled estimation of household prevalence. RESULTS: During March In NYS, outside of New York City, a total of 47,326 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, out of 141,495 tests (33% test-positive), with the highest number of cases located in the metropolitan region counties. Among 229 initial cases diagnosed through March 12, by March 30 13% were hospitalized and 2% died. Testing conducted among 498 members of these case’s households found prevalent infection among 57%; excluding first-reported cases 38%. In these homes, we found a significant age gradient in prevalence, from 23% among those <5 years to 68% among those ≥65 years (p<.0001). CONCLUSIONS: New York State faced a substantial and increasing COVID-19 outbreak during March 2020. The earliest cases had high levels of infection in their households and by the end of the month, the risks of hospitalization and death were high.","Rosenberg, Eli S; Dufort, Elizabeth M; Blog, Debra S; Hall, Eric W; Hoefer, Dina; Backenson, Bryon P; Muse, Alison T; Kirkwood, James N; George, Kirsten St; Holtgrave, David R; Hutton, Brad J; Zucker, Howard A",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32382743/,383

We present a large field experiment (N = 47,306) testing 19 nudges delivered to patients via text message and designed to boost adoption of the influenza vaccine. Our findings suggest that text messages sent prior to a primary care visit can boost vaccination rates by an average of 5%. Overall, interventions performed better when they were 1) framed as reminders to get flu shots that were already reserved for the patient and 2) congruent with the sort of communications patients expected to receive from their healthcare provider (i.e., not surprising, casual, or interactive). The best-performing intervention in our study reminded patients twice to get their flu shot at their upcoming doctor’s appointment and indicated it was reserved for them.

METHODS: We launched our community-based cohort to assess public perceptions of infectious disease outbreaks in mid-2019. After the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Singapore on 23 January, we launched a series of seven COVID-19 surveys to both existing and regularly enrolled new participants every 2 weeks. As well as sociodemographic properties of the participants, we recorded changing responses to judge awareness of the situation, trust in various information sources and perceived risk. We used multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate associations with perceptions of risk and self-reported adopted frequencies of protective behaviour. FINDINGS: Our cohort of 633 participants provided 2857 unique responses during the seven COVID-19 surveys. Most agreed or strongly agreed that information from official government sources (99.1%; 528/533) and Singapore-based news agencies (97.9%; 522/533) was trustworthy. Trust in government communication was significantly associated with higher perceived threat (odds ratio, OR: 2.2; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.6–3.0), but inversely associated with perceived risk of infection (OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4–0.8) or risk of death if infected (OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4–0.9). Trust in government communication was also associated with a greater likelihood of adopting protective behaviour. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that trust is a vital commodity when managing an evolving outbreak.

METHODS: We used telephonic screening to assess the need for patient admission. A telephonic triage was performed to identify the presence of COVID-19 infection risk factors or symptoms. New treatments were stratified according to priority codes. A reserved entrance to radiotherapy department was assured for patients and staff. Surgical disposable mask was required for patients and caregivers. The activities were distributed during the whole workday, avoiding overlap to reduce aggregation.

689158,Decline in stroke alerts and hospitalisations during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-08-20,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory failure from COVID-19 pneumonia is a major cause of death after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We investigated whether PaO(2)/FiO(2), oxygenation index (OI), SpO(2)/FiO(2), and oxygen saturation index (OSI), commonly used to assess the severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), can predict mortality in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this single-centered retrospective pilot study, we enrolled 68 critically ill mechanically ventilated adult patients with confirmed COVID-19. Physiological variables were recorded on the day of intubation (day 0) and postintubation days 3 and 7. The association between physiological parameters, PaO(2)/FiO(2), OI, SpO(2)/FiO(2), and OSI with mortality was assessed using multiple variable logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance of the predictive models. RESULTS: The ARDS severity indices were not statistically different on the day of intubation, suggesting similar baseline conditions in nonsurviving and surviving patients. However, these indices were significantly worse in the nonsurviving as compared to surviving patients on postintubation days 3 and 7. On intubation day 3, PaO(2)/FiO(2) was 101.0 (61.4) in nonsurviving patients vs. 140.2 (109.6) in surviving patients, p=0.004, and on day 7 106.3 (94.2) vs. 178.0 (69.3), p < 0.001. OI was 135.0 (129.7) in nonsurviving vs. 84.8 (86.1) in surviving patients (p=0.003) on day 3 and 150.0 (118.4) vs. 61.5 (46.7) (p < 0.001) on day 7. OSI was 12.0 (11.7) vs. 8.0 (10.0) (p=0.006) on day 3 and 14.7 (13.2) vs. 6.5 (5.4) (p < 0.001) on day 7. Similarly, SpO(2)/FiO(2) was 130 (90) vs. 210 (90) (p=0.003) on day 3 and 130 (90) vs. 230 (50) (p < 0.001) on day 7, while OSI was 12.0 (11.7) vs. 8.0 (10.0) (p=0.006) on day 3 and 14.7 (13.2) vs. 6.5 (5.4) (p < 0.001) on day 7 in the nonsurviving and surviving patients, respectively. All measures were independently associated with hospital mortality, with significantly greater odds ratios observed on day 7. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for mortality prediction was greatest on intubation day 7 (AUC = 0.775, 0.808, and 0.828 for PaO(2)/FiO(2), OI, SpO(2)/FiO(2), and OSI, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Decline in oxygenation indices after intubation is predictive of mortality in COVID-19 patients. This time window is critical to the outcome of these patients and a possible target for future interventions. Future large-scale studies to confirm the prognostic value of the indices in COVID-19 patients are warranted.","Nozari, Ala; Mukerji, Shivali; Vora, Molly; Garcia, Alfonso; Park, Alyssa; Flores, Nicholas; Canelli, Robert; Rodriguez, Gerardo; Pinciroli, Riccardo; Nagrebetsky, Alexander; Ortega, Rafael; Quraishi, Sadeq A.",Crit Care Res Pract,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6682944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34136282/,383

Group-testing strategies have been proposed to increase capacity, but these have been designed to facilitate mass population testing and do not prioritize turnaround time, an important consideration for HCW screening. We propose a non-adaptive combinatorial (NAC) group-testing strategy to increase throughput whilst facilitating rapid turnaround. NAC matrices were constructed for sample sizes of 700, 350 and 250. Matrix performance was tested by simulation under different SARS-CoV-2 prevalence scenarios of 0.1-10%. NAC matrices were compared to Dorfman Sequential (DS) group-testing approaches. NAC matrices performed well at low prevalence levels with an average of 97% of samples resolved after a single round of testing via the n=700 matrix at a prevalence of 1%. In simulations of low to medium (0.1%-3%) prevalence all NAC matrices were superior to the DS strategy, measured by fewer repeated tests required. At very high prevalence levels (10%) the DS matrix was marginally superior, however both group-testing approaches performed poorly at high prevalence levels. This strategy maximises the proportion of samples resolved after a single round of testing, allowing prompt return of results to HCWs. Using this methodology, laboratories can adapt their testing scheme based on required throughput and the current population prevalence, facilitating a data-driven testing strategy.","McDermott, John H.; Stoddard, Duncan; Woolf, Peter J.; Ellingford, Jamie M.; Gokhale, David; Taylor, Algy; Demain, Leigh; Newman, William G.; Black, Graeme",J Mol Diagn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33549858/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525157821000313; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525157821000313?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoldx.2021.01.010,383

Chloroquine, an amine acidotropic drug known to affect intracellular exocytic pathways by increasing endosomal pH, was used in the in vitro treatment of U937 cells infected with dengue virus type 2 (DENV‐2). Viral replication was assessed by quantification of virus produced through detection of copy numbers of DENV‐2 RNA, plaque assay and indirect immunofluorescence. qRT‐PCR and plaque assays were used to quantify the DENV‐2 load in infected U937 cells after CLQ treatment. It was found that a dose of 50 μg/mL of CLQ was not toxic to the cells and resulted in significantly less virus production in infected U937 cells than occurred in untreated cells. In the present work, CLQ was effective against DENV‐2 replication in U937 cells, and also caused a statistically significant reduction in expression of proinflammatory cytokines. The present study indicates that CLQ may be used to reduce viral yield in U937 cells.","Farias, Kleber Juvenal Silva; Machado, Paula Renata Lima; de Almeida Junior, Renato Ferreira; de Aquino, Ana Alice; da Fonseca, Benedito Antônio Lopes",Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24773578/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1348-0421.12154,383

A substantial proportion of lapses are due to urges to smoke triggered by situational cues. Currently, no available interventions proactively respond to such cues in real time. Quit Sense is a theory-guided just-in-time adaptive intervention smartphone app that uses a learning tool and smartphone sensing to provide in-the-moment tailored support to help smokers manage cue-induced urges to smoke. The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to assess the feasibility of delivering a definitive online efficacy trial of Quit Sense. METHODS AND ANALYSES: A two-arm parallel-group RCT allocating smokers willing to make a quit attempt, recruited via online adverts, to usual care (referral to the NHS SmokeFree website) or usual care plus Quit Sense. Randomisation will be stratified by smoking rate (<16 vs ≥16 cigarettes/day) and socioeconomic status (low vs high). Recruitment, enrolment, baseline data collection, allocation and intervention delivery will be automated through the study website. Outcomes will be collected at 6 weeks and 6 months follow-up via the study website or telephone, and during app usage. The study aims to recruit 200 smokers to estimate key feasibility outcomes, the preliminary impact of Quit Sense and potential cost-effectiveness, in addition to gaining insights on user views of the app through qualitative interviews.

MATERIALS AND METHOD: We reviewed the number and the findings of CMR scans performed during the COVID-19 pandemic between March and May 2020 at University of Naples Federico II. The number and the findings of CMR studies acquired in the corresponding months of 2017, 2018 and 2019 were also assessed for direct comparison. RESULTS: A total of 117 CMR studies was considered, including the procedures performed during the pandemic (n = 18) and those performed in the corresponding months of the prior 3 years (n = 99). The number of CMR studies performed during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly (P < .01) lower compared to the mean number (n = 33) of the procedures performed in the corresponding months of 2017−2019. The percentage of abnormal CMR studies was similar (P = 0.73) during the pandemic (67 %) compared to that found in the corresponding months of 2017−2019 (70 %) suggesting that many abnormal tests were missed due to the lockdown. CONCLUSION: The number of CMR studies was significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the corresponding period of the previous three years. The lack of difference in the prevalence of abnormal CMR studies between the two study time intervals strongly suggests that many patients with potentially abnormal imaging test have been missed during the pandemic.","Ponsiglione, Andrea; Nappi, Carmela; Imbriaco, Massimo; Ascione, Raffaele; Megna, Rosario; Petretta, Mario; Cuocolo, Alberto",Eur J Radiol Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33392363/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352047720301088; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352047720301088?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejro.2020.100319,383

Accordingly, the interim international resuscitation guidelines have restricted basic life support by lay rescuers to compression only and the use of an automated external defibrillator during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although these measures may diminish the risk of infection for laypersons, the missing respiratory support can be detrimental for patients with hypoxia-related cardiac arrest. To overcome this shortcoming we want to introduce a special tool that allows ventilation during barrier resuscitation by laypersons. We hypothesize that the application of a device made of a polyvinyl chloride shield with a centrally installed S-shaped ventilation pipe with integrated filter can provide adequate ventilation while concurrently protecting patient and rescuer from airborne agents. Aerosols from air leakage are removed by adhesion and drainage below the barrier. No specific training other than basic life support is needed.
