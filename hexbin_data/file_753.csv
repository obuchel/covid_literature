OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined whether quercitrin would be absorbed intactly in modeled Caco-2 cells, as well as determined the involvement of sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) in its transmembrane transport. DESIGN: The first experiment was conducted to examine the uptake of quercitrin into Caco-2 cells 24 h after they were seeded and the second experiment was conducted to determine the transport across the apical and basolateral membrane of Caco-2 cells after they were cultured for 21 days in a Millicell system. Quercitrin was administered at 3, 9, or 18 μg/mL; and the time points of sampling were 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min. RESULTS: In the uptake experiment, the highest intracellular quercitrin concentration was observed in the cells treated with 18 μg/mL quercitrin at 60 min, with a bell-shaped kinetic curve. Quercetin, isorhamnetin, and tamarixetin were detected inside the cells, particularly when treated with a high dose. In the transport experiment, quercitrin was transported from the apical to basolateral side and vice versa; its concentrations depended on dose, time, and transport direction (P < 0.0001). Only trace amounts of isorhamnetin and tamarixetin were detected in the apical chamber when quercitrin was added to the basolateral chamber. Phloridzin and phloretin, potent inhibitors of SGLT1 and GLUT2, respectively, significantly diminished quercitrin transport from the apical to basolateral side; and phloretin had a greater inhibitory effect compared to phloridzin. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that quercitrin is absorbed intactly and then effluxed out of Caco-2 cells through both apical and basolateral membranes probably via SGLT1 and GLUT2.","Li, Suyun; Liu, Jin; Li, Zheng; Wang, Liqin; Gao, Weina; Zhang, Zhenqing; Guo, Changjiang",Food Nutr Res,753,5

This occurs only rarely in children. It is found in two-thirds of patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Diagnosis is not so easy. It is based on a body of clinical evidence. We here report the peculiar case of a 7-year-old girl with a family history of atopic disease initially treated as asthma based on the presence of wheezing and dyspnea and cough without improvement. The patient had worsening of symptoms such as dyspnea at rest complicated by cyanosis in respiratory distress. All of this took place in a context of alteration of general state. Clinical examination showed growth retardation, perioral cyanosis with digital hippocratism. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral crackling sounds. Chest X-ray objectified bilateral interstitial syndrome. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed diffuse ground-glass opacities. Laboratory tests revealed hypereosinophilia with hyper-IgE and excluded tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, immune deficiency. In a second stage interview contact with birds was reported. Serological tests for bird fancier's disease were positive. The patient received inhaled corticosteroids associated with avoidance of exposure to birds. After a follow-up of 2 months, outcome was favorable. Given that the signs of bird fancier's disease are non-specific, this should be suspected in patients with respiratory symptoms associated with exposure to avian antigens.","Jallouli, Abderrahmane; Fakiri, Karima El; Rada, Noureddine; Draiss, Ghizlane; Bouskraoui, Mohammed",Pan Afr Med J,753,5

This prospective randomized controlled trial aimed to assess safety, efficacy and potential benefits of single-port total extraperitoneal inguinal herniorraphy beyond the learning curve. METHODS All referred patients with inguinal/femoral hernias were enrolled from December 2011 to February 2013. Exclusion criteria included workers compensation cases. Identical balloon dissector, light-weight mesh and non-absorbable tacks were used in all cases. For single-port cases Triport™ was used while structural balloon trocar/inflation bulb for multiport cases. Results were analyzed with IBM(®) SPSS(®) version 22 for Windows. RESULTS Participation rate was 100 % with 157 inguinal/femoral hernias in 100 patients: 51 randomized to single-port and 49 to multiport group. There was no conversion to open surgery/need for additional ports. There were no statistical differences between single-port and multiport groups with respect to age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, preoperative pain, hernia defect sizes and length of hospital stay. Operation times were equivalent for single-port and multiport 60.0 vs 61.0 min, P = 0.23, respectively. Significantly, single-port patients ingested fewer pain killers: 6 tablets vs 14 Dextropropoxyphene tablets, P < 0.001, experienced less pain (visual analog scores) on day 1 and 7 post-op op: 2.5 and 0, P < 0.001 compared to 4.5 and 2.5, P < 0.001, respectively, returned to work/normal physical activities 7 days quicker: 7.0 vs 14.0, P < 0.001 and had higher cosmetic scar scores at 6-week follow-up: 24 vs 21, P < 0.001, compared to multiport patients. There were no mortalities, morbidities or recurrences after follow-up of 6-21 months. CONCLUSIONS Compared to multiport, single-port laparoscopic total extraperitoneal inguinal herniorraphy, when performed by a high-volume and highly dedicated hernia surgeon, resulted in significantly reduced postoperative pain, analgesic requirements, quicker return to work/normal activities, improved cosmesis, and equivalent safety and efficacy.","Tran, H; Turingan, I; Tran, K; Zajkowska, M; Lam, V; Hawthorne, W",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,753,1

A thirty-nine-year-old male with no comorbid diseases applied to our outpatient clinic with the complaints of sore throat, fatigue and subfebrile fever. He had a contact history of his wife who has a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. The nasopharyngeal swab was performed and his SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test was confirmed positive. He recovered from all symptoms in one week. On the second week of the first diagnosis, he developed neck pain, fatigue, muscle pains, palpitation and tremors. Because his thyroid palpation was painful and he was more symptomatic thyroid function tests were performed. Thyrotropin was suppressed (0.01 mIU/L), free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine levels were high as 11 ng/L and 3.72 ng/dL, respectively. His cervical ultrasound also revealed SAT.

This system was created for early detection of infectious-disease outbreaks, either natural or intentional. However, limited documentation exists regarding epidemiologic field investigations conducted in response to syndromic surveillance signals. OBJECTIVE DOHMH conducted field investigations to characterize syndromic surveillance signals by person, place, and time and to determine whether signals represented true infectious-disease outbreaks. METHODS A DOHMH physician reviews ED-based syndromic surveillance results daily to look for signals. When necessary, field investigations are conducted and consist of a review of the patient line list, telephone interviews with hospital staff, chart reviews, interviews with patients, and collection and testing of specimens. RESULTS In November 2002, a series of citywide signals for diarrhea and vomiting syndromes, which coincided with institutional outbreaks consistent with viral gastroenteritis, prompted DOHMH to send mass e-mail notification to NYC ED directors and institute collection of stool specimens. Three of four specimens collected were positive for norovirus. In December 2002, DOHMH investigated why an ED syndromic signal was not generated after 15 ill patients were transferred to a participating ED during a gastrointestinal outbreak at a nursing home. Field investigation revealed varying chief complaints, multiple dates of ED visits, and a coding error in a complementary DOHMH syndromic system, and confirmed a seasonal norovirus outbreak. During March 2003, the system generated a 4-day citywide respiratory signal and a simultaneous 1-day hospital-level fever signal in a predominantly Asian community. In those instances, epidemiologic investigation provided reassurance that severe acute respiratory syndrome was not present. CONCLUSION Detailed field investigations of syndromic signals can identify the etiology of signals and determine why a given syndromic surveillance system failed to detect an outbreak captured through traditional surveillance. Validation of the utility of syndromic surveillance to detect infectious-disease outbreaks is necessary to justify allocating resources for this new public health tool.","Steiner-Sichel, Linda; Greenko, J; Heffernan, R; Layton, M; Weiss, D",MMWR supplements,753,20

METHODS: In a longitudinal survey, we asked cigarette smokers in Pakistan about their smoking behaviours before and since COVID-19. Smokers were recruited before COVID-19 using two-stage random probability sampling. Since COVID-19, three subsequent waves were conducted over the telephone, asking additional questions on social determinants, mental health and wellbeing. Based on the first two waves, we estimated the proportion of smokers who stopped, decreased, maintained, or increased smoking. We also explored any factors associated with the change in smoking patterns. In those who stopped smoking soon after COVID-19, we estimated the proportion relapsed in subsequent waves. We estimated all proportions based on complete-case analysis. RESULTS: We recruited 6,014 smokers between September 2019 and February 2020; of these, 2,087 (2,062 reported smoking outcomes) were followed up in May 2020 after COVID-19. Since COVID-19, 14% (290/2,062) smokers reported quitting. Among those who continued smoking: 68% (1210/1772) reduced, 14% (239/1772) maintained, and 18% (323/1772) increased cigarette consumption; 37% (351/938) reported at least one quit attempt; 41% (669/1619) were more motivated while 21% (333/1619) were less motivated to quit. Changes in smoking patterns varied with nicotine dependence, motivation to quit, and financial stability since COVID-19. Among those reporting quitting soon after COVID-19, 39% (81/206) relapsed in the subsequent months (June-July 2020). CONCLUSIONS: There have been significant bidirectional changes in smoking patterns since COVID-19 in Pakistan. While many people stopped, reduced, or tried quitting smoking, some increased smoking, and some relapsed after quitting. IMPLICATIONS: We observed significant and complex changes in people's smoking patterns, which are likely to be attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and replicated in similar events in the future. Assessing these changes are essential for most low- and middle-income countries like Pakistan, where the vast majority of tobacco users live, but cessation support is still rudimentary. If provided routinely, smoking cessation interventions can potentially support millions of highly motivated individuals in quitting successfully both in general as well as in global events like COVID-19, in particular.","Siddiqi, Kamran; Siddiqui, Faraz; Khan, Amina; Ansaari, Saeed; Kanaan, Mona; Khokhar, Mariam; Islam, Ziauddin; Mishu, Masuma Pervin; Bauld, Linda",Nicotine tob. res,753,15

In Spain, the first pandemic wave started in mid-March 2020 and lasted for 3 months, requiring home confinement and strict lockdown. Following relaxation of the measures during the summer, a second wave commenced in mid-September 2020 and extended until Christmas 2020. METHODS: The two pandemic waves were compared using information collected from rapid diagnostic tests and polymerase chain reaction assays at one university clinic in Madrid, the epicentre of the pandemic in Spain. RESULTS: In total, 1569 individuals (968 during the first wave and 601 during the second wave) were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using fingerprick capillary blood. In addition, during the second wave, 346 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antigen using either oral swabs or saliva. The overall seroprevalence of first-time-tested individuals was 12.6% during the first wave and 7.7% during the second wave (P < 0.01). Seroconversions and seroreversions within 6 months occurred at low rates, both below 5%. During the second wave, 3.5% of tested individuals were SARS-CoV-2 antigen positive, with two cases considered as re-infections. Severe clinical symptoms occurred in a greater proportion of cases during the first wave compared with the second wave (27.8% vs 10.6%, respectively; P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The cumulative seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Madrid at the end of 2020 was approximately 20%. Seroreversions within 6 months occurred in 4% of cases. Seroconversions and re-infections were clinically less severe during the second wave than during the first wave. Hypothetically, a lower viral inoculum as a result of social distancing, increased use of face masks, promotion of outdoor activities and restrictions on gatherings may have contributed to this lower pathogenicity.","Soriano, Vicente; Ganado-Pinilla, Pilar; Sanchez-Santos, Miguel; Gómez-Gallego, Felix; Barreiro, Pablo; de Mendoza, Carmen; Corral, Octavio",Int J Infect Dis,753,21

The threats that COVID-19 pose to the global coffee sector is daunting with profound implications for coffee production. The financial impacts will be long-lived and uneven, and smallholders will be among the hardest hit. We argue that the impacts are rooted in the systemic vulnerability of the coffee production system and the unequal ways the sector is organized: Large revenues from the sale of coffee in the Global North are made possible by mostly impoverished smallholders in the Global South. COVID-19 will accentuate the existing vulnerabilities and create new ones, forcing many smallholders into alternative livelihoods. This outcome, however, is not inevitable.

Our aim was to quantify the association between influenza vaccination status and risk of hospitalisation or all-cause mortality in people diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using routinely collected health records from patients registered to a General Practitioner (GP) practice in South West England within the Electronic Care and Health Information Analytics database. The cohort included 6921 people with COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic (1 January-31 July 2020). Data on influenza vaccination, hospitalisation and all-cause mortality were ascertained through linked clinical and demographic records. We applied propensity score methods (stabilised inverse probability of treatment weight) to quantify the association between influenza vaccination status and COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalisation or all-cause mortality). RESULTS: 2613 (38%) participants received an influenza vaccination between 1 January 2019 and COVID-19 diagnosis. Receipt of influenza vaccination was associated with a significantly lower odds of hospitalisation or all-cause mortality (adjusted OR: 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97, p=0.02), and 24% reduced odds of all-cause mortality (adjusted OR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.90).

To prevent the spread of infection, local governments across the United States issued mandatory lockdowns and stay-at-home orders. In the surgical world, elective cases ceased to help ""flatten the curve"" and prevent the infection from spreading to hospital staff and patients. We explored the effect of the cancellation of these procedures on trainee operative experience at our high-volume, multihospital neurosurgical practice. Methods: Our department cancelled all elective cases starting March 16, 2020, and resumed elective surgical and endovascular procedures on May 11, 2020. We retrospectively reviewed case volumes for 54 days prelockdown and 54 days postlockdown to evaluate the extent of the decrease in surgical volume at our institution. Procedure data were collected and then divided into cranial, spine, functional, peripheral nerve, pediatrics, and endovascular categories. Results: Mean total cases per day in the prelockdown group were 12.26 ± 7.7, whereas in the postlockdown group, this dropped to 7.78 ± 5.5 (P = 0.01). In the spine category, mean cases per day in the prelockdown group were 3.13 ± 2.63;in the postlockdown group, this dropped to 0.96 ± 1.36 (P &lt; 0.001). In the functional category, mean cases per day in the prelockdown group were 1.31 ± 1.51, whereas in the postlockdown group, this dropped to 0.11 ± 0.42 (P &lt; 0.001). For cranial (P = 0.245), peripheral nerve (P = 0.16), pediatrics (P = 0.34), and endovascular (P = 0.48) cases, the volumes dropped but were not statistically significant decreases. Conclusion: The impact of this outbreak on operative training does appear to be significant based solely on statistics. Although the drop in case volumes during this time can be accounted for by the pandemic, it is important to understand that this is a multifactorial effect. Further studies are needed for these results to be generalizable and to fully understand the effect this pandemic has had on trainee operative experience.

New scales and tools have been developed to measure these mental health effects. This narrative review assesses the psychometric properties of these scales and tools and methodological aspects of their development. METHODS: PubMed, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar were searched for articles published from 15 May 2020 to 15 August 2020. This search used three groups of terms (""tool"" OR ""scale"" AND ""mental"" OR ""psychological""; AND ""COVID-19"" OR ""coronavirus""). The identified scales were further evaluated for their psychometric properties and methodological aspects of their development. RESULTS: Though the studies developing these scales (n = 12) have demonstrated their robust psychometric properties, some methodological concerns are noteworthy. Most of the scales were validated using internet-based surveys, and detailed descriptions of the mode of administration, sampling process, response rates, and augmentation strategies were missing. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneous and inadequate reporting of methods adopted to evaluate the psychometric properties of the identified scales can limit their utility in clinical and research settings. We suggest developing guidelines and checklists to improve the design and testing, and result in reporting of online-administered scales to assess the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ransing, Ramdas; Dashi, Elona; Rehman, Sajjadur; Mehta, Varun; Chepure, Ashish; Kilic, Ozge; Hayatudeen, Nafisatu; Orsolini, Laura; Vahdani, Bita; Adiukwu, Frances; Gonzalez-Diaz, Jairo M; Larnaout, Amine; Pinto da Costa, Mariana; Grandinetti, Paolo; Soler-Vidal, Joan; Bytyçi, Drita Gashi; Shalbafan, Mohammadreza; Nofal, Marwa; Pereira-Sanchez, Victor; Ramalho, Rodrigo",Australas Psychiatry,753,5

We included all adults (aged &#8805;18 years) alive and in follow-up on Feb 1, 2020, and with at least 1 year of continuous registration with a general practitioner before this date. People with a primary care record for HIV infection were compared with people without HIV. The outcome was COVID-19 death, defined as the presence of International Classification of Diseases 10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 anywhere on the death certificate. Cox regression models were used to estimate the association between HIV infection and COVID-19 death; they were initially adjusted for age and sex, then we added adjustment for index of multiple deprivation and ethnicity, and then for a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess effect modification by age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and calendar time. RESULTS: 17â282â905 adults were included, of whom 27â480 (0·16%) had HIV recorded.

People living with HIV had higher risk of COVID-19 death than those without HIV after adjusting for age and sex: hazard ratio (HR) 2·90 (95% CI 1·96-4·30; p<0·0001). The association was attenuated, but risk remained high, after adjustment for deprivation, ethnicity, smoking and obesity: adjusted HR 2·59 (95% CI 1·74-3·84; p<0·0001).

Data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into 3 disease severity groups (nonsevere, severe, and critical), based on initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify risk factors associated with clinical outcomes, and log-rank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. RESULTS: Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement in patient outcomes. By univariate logistic regression analysis, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Multivariate regression indicated age >65 years (P < .001), smoking (P = .001), critical disease status (P = .002), diabetes (P = .025), high hypersensitive troponin I (>0.04 pg/mL, P = .02), leukocytosis (>10 × 109/L, P < .001), and neutrophilia (>75 × 109/L, P < .001) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. In contrast, the administration of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes (P < .001), which was confirmed by survival analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Hypnotics may be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes.

The NS is protected by rather complicated multi-layer barriers that allow access to nutrients and facilitate contact with the peripheral tissues, but block entry of pathogens and toxins. Virus infections usually begin in peripheral tissues and if these barriers are weakened, they can spread into the PNS and more rarely into the CNS. Most viral infections of the NS are opportunistic or accidental pathogens that gain access via the bloodstream (e.g., HIV and various arboviruses). But a few have evolved to enter the NS efficiently by invading neurons directly and by exploiting neuronal cell biology (e.g., rhabdoviruses and alphaherpesviruses). Most NS infections are devastating and difficult to manage. Remarkably, the alphaherpesviruses establish life-long quiescent infections in the PNS, with rare but often serious CNS pathology. In this review, we will focus on how alphaherpesviruses gain access to and spread in the NS, with particular emphasis on bidirectional transport and spread within and between neurons and neural circuits, which is regulated by complex viral-host protein interactions. Finally, we will describe the wide use of alphaherpesviruses as tools to study nerve connectivity and function in animal models.","Koyuncu, Orkide O; Enquist, Lynn W; Engel, Esteban A",Curr Issues Mol Biol,753,1

METHODS: The number of diagnosed cases in Fujian Province was collected, and the time distribution of these cases was analyzed. RESULTS: The results showed that the COVID-19 prevalence in areas with epidemics due to imported cases could be divided into two stages. The first stage was an outbreak dominated by imported cases, with the data showing an obviously skewed distribution. The second stage was dominated by nonimported cases with sporadic and low-level fluctuations. Moreover, the data demonstrated that the ratio of unexplained infections to nonimported cases was increasing. CONCLUSIONS: A two-stage outbreak in areas with epidemics due to imported cases, effective control of the ""source of infection"" and blocking of the transmission route can significantly minimize the peak height in the first stage and the spread of the epidemic in the second stage. Control of the epidemic in the second stage requires prevention and control of the aggregation of cases caused by unexplained infections.","Zhang, Wenchang; Liu, Jin; Zhang, Chenyun; Sun, Yi; Huang, Huiling",Int J Public Health,753,16

The hypothesis that immunity to bee venom could have a preventive effect was expressed and the authors of the Chinese survey suggested that the next step should be animal experiments on monkeys. We believed that before starting such studies, a second independent survey should verify the findings and define the hypothesis more clearly. Thus we asked all German beekeepers to complete an assessment form which would summarize their experiences with COVID-19. In contrast to the Chinese study we found that two beekeepers had died from a SARS-CoV-2 infection and forty-five were affected. The reaction to bee stings (none; mild swelling; severe swelling) correlated with the perceived severity of the SARS-CoV-2-infection-associated symptoms - exhaustion and sore throat. Beekeepers comorbidity correlated with problems with breathing at rest, fever, and diarrhea. Our results did not confirm the findings of the Chinese study.

While several new virtual learning programs have been recently implemented, the perspective of urology trainees regarding their usefulness still needs to be investigated. METHODS: A cross-sectional, 30-item, web-based Survey was conducted through Twitter from April 4th, 2020 to April 18th, 2020, aiming to evaluate the urology residents' perspective on smart learning (SL) modalities (pre-recorded videos, webinars, podcasts, and social media [SoMe]), and contents (frontal lessons, clinical case discussions, updates on Guidelines and on clinical trials, surgical videos, Journal Clubs, and seminars on leadership and non-technical skills). RESULTS: Overall, 501 urology residents from 58 countries completed the survey. Of these, 78.4, 78.2, 56.9 and 51.9% of them considered pre-recorded videos, interactive webinars, podcasts and SoMe highly useful modalities of smart learning, respectively. The contents considered as highly useful by the greatest proportion of residents were updates on guidelines (84.8%) and surgical videos (81.0%). In addition, 58.9 and 56.5% of responders deemed seminars on leadership and on non-technical skills highly useful smart learning contents. The three preferred combinations of smart learning modality and content were: pre-recorded surgical videos, interactive webinars on clinical cases, and pre-recorded videos on guidelines.

Version of 10 May 2020],15.454569,-1.1878594,2020,"BACKGROUND: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes corona virus disease (COVID-19). The most standard diagnostic method is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal and/or an oropharyngeal swab. The high occurrence of false-negative results due to the non-presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the oropharyngeal environment renders this sampling method not ideal. Therefore, a new sampling device is desirable. This proof-of-principle study investigated the possibility to train machine-learning classifiers with an electronic nose (Aeonose) to differentiate between COVID-19-positive and negative persons based on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analysis. METHODS: Between April and June 2020, participants were invited for breath analysis when a swab for RT-PCR was collected. If the RT-PCR resulted negative, the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was checked to confirm the negative result. All participants breathed through the Aeonose for five minutes. This device contains metal-oxide sensors that change in conductivity upon reaction with VOCs in exhaled breath. These conductivity changes are input data for machine learning and used for pattern recognition. The result is a value between - 1 and + 1, indicating the infection probability. RESULTS: 219 participants were included, 57 of which COVID-19 positive. A sensitivity of 0.86 and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.92 were found. Adding clinical variables to machine-learning classifier via multivariate logistic regression analysis, the NPV improved to 0.96. CONCLUSIONS: The Aeonose can distinguish COVID-19 positive from negative participants based on VOC patterns in exhaled breath with a high NPV. The Aeonose might be a promising, non-invasive, and low-cost triage tool for excluding SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients elected for surgery.","Wintjens, Anne G W E; Hintzen, Kim F H; Engelen, Sanne M E; Lubbers, Tim; Savelkoul, Paul H M; Wesseling, Geertjan; van der Palen, Job A M; Bouvy, Nicole D",Surg. endosc,753,4

There are limited data on how such social determinants of health, including neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, affect the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine how social determinants of health are associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 illness in hospitalized pregnant patients in New York during the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study evaluated all pregnant patients who delivered and had polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between March 15, 2020, and June 15, 2020, at 7 hospitals within Northwell Health, the largest academic health system in New York. During the study period, universal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing protocols were implemented at all sites. Polymerase chain reaction testing was performed using nasopharyngeal swabs. Patients were excluded if the following variables were not available: polymerase chain reaction results, race, ethnicity, or zone improvement plan (ZIP) code of residence. Clinical data were obtained from the enterprise electronic health record system. For each patient, ZIP code was used as a proxy for neighborhood. Socioeconomic characteristics were determined by linking to ZIP code data from the United States Census Bureau's American Community Survey and the Internal Revenue Service's Statistics of Income Division. Specific variables of interest included mean persons per household, median household income, percent unemployment, and percent with less than high school education. Medical records were manually reviewed for all subjects with positive polymerase chain reaction test results to correctly identify symptomatic patients and then classify those subjects using the National Institutes of Health severity of illness categories. Classification was based on the highest severity of illness throughout gestation and not necessarily at the time of presentation for delivery. RESULTS: A total of 4873 patients were included in the study. The polymerase chain reaction test positivity rate was 11% (n=544). Among this group, 359 patients (66%) were asymptomatic or presymptomatic, 115 (21%) had mild or moderate coronavirus disease 2019, and 70 (13%) had severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019. On multiple logistic regression modeling, pregnant patients who had a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were more likely to be younger or of higher parity, belong to minoritized racial and ethnic groups, have public health insurance, have limited English proficiency, and reside in low-income neighborhoods with less educational attainment. On ordinal logit regression modeling, obesity, income and education were associated with coronavirus disease 2019 severity. CONCLUSION: Social and physical determinants of health play a role in determining the risk of infection. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 illness was not associated with race or ethnicity but was associated with maternal obesity and neighborhood level characteristics such as educational attainment and household income.","Prasannan, Lakha; Rochelson, Burton; Shan, Weiwei; Nicholson, Kaitlin; Solmonovich, Rachel; Kulkarni, Aparna; Lewis, Dawnette; Greenberg, Meir; Nimaroff, Michael; Blitz, Matthew J",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,753,26

To make it proper to perform them, understanding of the immunological aspects is critically important. The present study aimed to assess humoral responses in COVID-19 using various quantitative antibody tests. METHODS: Four quantitative antibody tests that are different in targeted antigens, detectable immunoglobulin classes and avidity were used. Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Antibody titres of 117 samples collected from 24 COVID-19 patients and 23 non-COVID-19 patients were measured to evaluate correlations between different tests. For 24 COVID-19 patients, antibody titres measured at various time points after the onset or the RT-PCR diagnosis were subjected to assessment of humoral responses. RESULTS: Correlations between tests were observed to some degree, although there were discrepancies putatively due to differences in measurement principle. Seronegative COVID-19 was diagnosed for some patients, in whom antibody titres were less than the cut-off value in each test throughout the time courses. IgG seroconversion without prior IgM seroconversion most frequently occurred, while predominance of IgM responses over IgG responses was observed in some severe cases. Viral burdens estimated according to threshold cycle values at the RT-PCR seemed to impact antibody responses.

We point out specific epithelial-immune interactions which could help SARS-CoV-2 evade the immune response. By integrating our data with existing experimental data, we provide a set of epithelial ligands likely to drive the inflammatory response upon infection.

For those who survived COVID-19, post-COVID cardiac damage poses a major threat for the progression of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Currently, the number of COVID-related cases and deaths are increasing in Latin America, where a major COVID comorbidity is Chagas heart disease (caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi). Here, we investigated the effect of T. cruzi infection on the pathogenesis and severity of CoV2 infection and, conversely, the effect of CoV2 infection on heart pathology during coinfection. Methodology/findingsWe used transgenic human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (huACE2) mice infected with CoV2, T. cruzi, or coinfected with both in this study. Our study shows for the first time that white adipose tissue (WAT) serves as a reservoir for CoV2 and the persistence of CoV2 in WAT alters adipose tissue morphology and adipocyte physiology. Our data demonstrate a correlation between the loss of fat cells and the pulmonary adipogenic signaling (via adiponectin isomers) and pathology in CoV2 infection. The viral load in the lungs is inversely proportional to the viral load in WAT, which differs between male and female mice. Our findings also suggest that adiponectin-PPAR signaling may differently regulate Chagas cardiomyopathy in coinfected males and females. ConclusionWe conclude that adipogenic signaling may play important roles in cardio-pulmonary pathogenesis during CoV2 infection and T. cruzi coinfection.

In primary cultures of dorsal root ganglia neurons, we showed that frataxin depletion resulted in decreased levels of the mitochondrial calcium exchanger NCLX, neurite degeneration and apoptotic cell death. Here we describe that frataxin-deficient dorsal root ganglia neurons display low levels of ferredoxin 1, a mitochondrial Fe/S cluster-containing protein that interacts with frataxin and, interestingly, is essential for the synthesis of calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D. We provide data that calcitriol supplementation, used at nanomolar concentrations, is able to reverse the molecular and cellular markers altered in DRG neurons. Calcitriol is able to recover both ferredoxin 1 and NCLX levels and restores mitochondrial membrane potential indicating an overall mitochondrial function improvement. Accordingly, reduction of apoptotic markers and neurite degeneration was observed and, as a result, cell survival was also recovered. All these beneficial effects would be explained by the finding that calcitriol is able to increase the mature frataxin levels in both, frataxin-deficient DRG neurons and cardiomyocytes; remarkably, this increase also occurs in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from FA patients. In conclusion, these results provide molecular bases to consider calcitriol for an easy and affordable therapeutic approach for FA patients.","Britti, Elena; Delaspre, Fabien; Sanz, Arabela; Medina-Carbonero, Marta; Llovera, Marta; Purroy, Rosa; Mincheva-Tasheva, Stefka; Tamarit, Jordi; Ros, Joaquim",Biochem. j,753,20

The presence of additive biomacromolecules has been known to influence various stages of the precipitation process from nucleation to crystal growth. In the current work, well-defined sequences of short, negatively charged peptides, oligo(l-glutamic acids), were utilized as a model, inspired by contiguous sequences of acidic amino acids in natural biomineralization proteins. The precipitate morphology and phases, the element time profile in solution and in the precipitates, as well as the kinetics during the precipitation process were analyzed to explain the effect of these short peptides on calcium phosphate precipitation. The results show that peptides can delay the phase transformation of an amorphous precursor phase to hydroxyapatite and that there is an optimal chain length for this effect at a given concentration of peptide. This study is the first part of a two-part series and is followed by a subsequent work to reveal the mechanism by which these short peptides influence the calcium phosphate precipitation.","Ustriyana, Putu; Harmon, Emma; Chen, Kexun; Michel, F Marc; Sahai, Nita",J Phys Chem B,753,29

Here, we analyzed processing of the coronavirus nsp7-10 region using native mass spectrometry showing consumption of substrate, rise and fall of intermediate products and complexation. Importantly, there is a clear order of cleavage efficiencies, which is influenced by the polyprotein tertiary structure. Furthermore, the predominant product is an nsp7+8(2 : 2) hetero-tetramer with nsp8 scaffold.

To understand HCWs' fears and concerns surrounding PPE, their experiences following its guidance and how these affected their perceived ability to deliver care during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A rapid qualitative appraisal study combining three sources of data: semistructured in-depth telephone interviews with frontline HCWs (n=46), media reports (n=39 newspaper articles and 145 000 social media posts) and government PPE policies (n=25). PARTICIPANTS: Interview participants were HCWs purposively sampled from critical care, emergency and respiratory departments as well as redeployed HCWs from primary, secondary and tertiary care centres across the UK. RESULTS: A major concern was running out of PPE, putting HCWs and patients at risk of infection. Following national level guidance was often not feasible when there were shortages, leading to reuse and improvisation of PPE. Frequently changing guidelines generated confusion and distrust. PPE was reserved for high-risk secondary care settings and this translated into HCWs outside these settings feeling inadequately protected. Participants were concerned about differential access to adequate PPE, particularly for women and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic HCWs. Participants continued delivering care despite the physical discomfort, practical problems and communication barriers associated with PPE use. CONCLUSION: This study found that frontline HCWs persisted in caring for their patients despite multiple challenges including inappropriate provision of PPE, inadequate training and inconsistent guidance. In order to effectively care for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline HCWs need appropriate provision of PPE, training in its use as well as comprehensive and consistent guidance. These needs must be addressed in order to protect the health and well-being of the most valuable healthcare resource in the COVID-19 pandemic: our HCWs.","Hoernke, Katarina; Djellouli, Nehla; Andrews, Lily; Lewis-Jackson, Sasha; Manby, Louisa; Martin, Sam; Vanderslott, Samantha; Vindrola-Padros, Cecilia",BMJ Open,753,16

The professors' self-efficacy for online education, institutional engagement, and academic planning had the highest scores. The expectations of professors did not directly change the academic performance of students;however, a moderating effect of professor's expectations was identified in the previous student academic performance relationship on their current academic performance.","Lobos Peña, K.; Bustos-Navarrete, C.; Cobo-Rendón, R.; Fernández Branada, C.; Bruna Jofré, C.; Maldonado Trapp, A.",Front Psychol,753,23

This paper provides lessons from a series of qualitative research projects that were adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure their continuation and completion. By reflecting on our experiences and discussing the opportunities and challenges presented by crises to the use of a number of qualitative research methods, we provide a series of insights and lessons for proactively building resilience into the qualitative research process. We show that reflexivity, responsiveness, adaptability, and flexibility ensured continuity in the research projects and highlighted distinct advantages to using digital methods, providing lessons beyond the COVID-19 context. The paper concludes with reflections on research resilience and adaptation during crises.

This study aimed to understand the contextual, media, and economic factors associated with anticipated mental health consequences from the COVID-19 pandemic among Americans. A nationally representative survey of 1001 respondents was conducted in April 2020. Chi-square tests and logistic regressions examined anticipated emotional or psychological effects on respondents or members of their households should social distancing measures continue. Specific analyses focused on: 1) COVID-19 experience - knowing someone or being infected; living in a state with a high death rate; or state social distancing policies; 2) media exposure - source of coronavirus information and time spent on coronavirus news; and 3) economics - current economic effects; and anticipated long-term financial effects. 41% of respondents anticipated mental health consequences. Living in a state with a greater COVID-19 death rate (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.10, 2.72) and anticipating long-term financial difficulties (OR 2.98; 95% CI 1.93, 4.60) were both associated with greater likelihood of anticipated mental health consequences. Those whose primary news source was television, as opposed to print or online, were almost 50% less likely to anticipate mental health challenges (OR 0.52 CI 0.33, 0.81), while those who reported spending two or more hours daily on COVID-19 news were 90% more likely (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.27, 2.85). Aspects of community health, media consumption, and economic impacts influence anticipated poor mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting each domain is relevant to interventions to address the consequences.","Piltch-Loeb, Rachael; Merdjanoff, Alexis; Meltzer, Gabriella",Prev Med,753,5

Participants (n = 704) completed measures of individualism-collectivism, belief in conspiracy theories about COVID-19, feelings of powerlessness, and intentions to engage in behaviours that reduce the spread of COVID-19. Results revealed that vertical individualism negatively predicted intentions to engage in social distancing, directly and indirectly through both belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and feelings of powerlessness. Vertical collectivism positively predicted social distancing intentions directly. Horizontal collectivism positively predicted social distancing intentions indirectly through feelings of powerlessness. Finally, horizontal collectivism positively predicted hygiene-related intentions both directly and indirectly through lower feelings of powerlessness. These findings suggest that promoting collectivism may be a way to increase engagement with efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19. They also highlight the importance of examining the interplay between culture and both personal feelings (powerlessness) and information consumption (conspiracy theories) during times of crisis.","Biddlestone, Mikey; Green, Ricky; Douglas, Karen M",Br J Soc Psychol,753,16

OBJECTIVES: Describe the implications of post-COVID syndrome due to neurological sequelae including treatment and the differences that may exist between this group of patients and those who present these events not associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A non-systematic review of the literature was carried out in PubMed and Science Direct databases, using the keywords ""Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome""; ""Neurological complications""; ""Neurologic Manifestations"" ""COVID-19â³ and ""Rehabilitation"", as well as synonyms, which were combined with the operators ""AND"" and ""OR"". RESULTS: The COVID-19 viral caustive agent, SARS-CoV-2, has a high affinity for human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor on type II pneumocytes. This receptor is also expressed in neurons and glial cells. Based on the foregoing and other not so clear mechanisms, it is stated that SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for the nervous system, being evident through the neurological manifestations observed in patients with mild, moderate and severe phenotype of the disease such as anosmia, ageusia, headache, cerebrovascular accidents, Guillain-Barré syndrome, seizures, and encephalopathy. This can generate severe sequelae and even fatal outcomes in those affected. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological complications caused by COVID-19 are frequent and represent a risk that compromises the functional capacity and the life of patients. The suspicion of these conditions, the strict control of metabolic alterations and cardiovascular risk factors, the effective and safe treatment of these entities, are a current challenge throughout the pandemic. The rehabilitation process in these patients is a challenge.

During a global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, a timely surveillance method is urgently needed to track the impact on public mental health. OBJECTIVE: This brief systematic review focused on the efficiency and quality of data collection of studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We searched the PubMed database using the following search strings: ((COVID-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2)) AND ((Mental health) OR (psychological) OR (psychiatry)). We screened the titles, abstracts, and texts of the published papers to exclude irrelevant studies. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to evaluate the quality of each research paper. RESULTS: Our search yielded 37 relevant mental health surveys of the general public that were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, as of July 10, 2020. All these public mental health surveys were cross-sectional in design, and the journals efficiently made these articles available online in an average of 18.7 (range 1-64) days from the date they were received. The average duration of recruitment periods was 9.2 (range 2-35) days, and the average sample size was 5137 (range 100-56,679). However, 73% (27/37) of the selected studies had Newcastle-Ottawa Scale scores of <3 points, which suggests that these studies are of very low quality for inclusion in a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The studies examined in this systematic review used an efficient data collection method, but there was a high risk of bias, in general, among the existing public mental health surveys. Therefore, following recommendations to avoid selection bias, or employing novel methodologies considering both a longitudinal design and high temporal resolution, would help provide a strong basis for the formation of national mental health policies.","Lin, Yu-Hsuan; Chen, Chung-Yen; Wu, Shiow-Ing",J Med Internet Res,753,16

Civil Code provides for a trifling set of provisions regarding the same. Albeit, there exists the FIDIC provisions- A n internationally recognized and accepted set of principles and rules governing construction contracts. This paper aims to comment on the applicability of FIDIC provisions in the U.A.E., the issues that ordinarily arise from the FIDIC conditions against the backdrop of construction law in the U.A.E., along with a remark on the COVID-19 impact regarding the same. The study finds that FIDIC contracts are indeed applicable in the U.A.E. although not to a great extent i.e. not many construction projects are governed by the FIDIC provisions in U.A.E., as there are clauses within the U.A.E. Civil Code (Muqaawala) which briefly fend for the law on construction contracts. With that being said, the FIDIC Red, Pink, Yellow Silver books amongst the rainbow suite of books are most applicable in the U.A.E. In regards to the existing law on construction contracts in the U.A.E., the study notes areas of contrast such as provisions regarding interest and delay damages as well as areas which blend in against the backdrop of FIDIC provisions such as suspension termination clauses. This study further examines and interprets the engineer's role in construction contracts as no specific mention has been made regarding the same in the provisions of the civil code. Moreover, COVID-19 may perhaps be considered a Force Majeure event provided it renders performance of contract impossible and matters affected by COVID can be claimed only upon the discretionary power of the U.A.E. courts to declare the same.

RT-PCR tests are highly specific and the probability of false positives is low, but false negatives are possible depending on swab type and time since symptom onset.AimTo determine how the probability of obtaining a false-negative test in infected patients is affected by time since symptom onset and swab type.MethodsWe used generalised additive mixed models to analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple RT-PCR tests and were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive at least once.ResultsThe probability of a positive test decreased with time since symptom onset, with oropharyngeal (OP) samples less likely to yield a positive result than nasopharyngeal (NP) samples. The probability of incorrectly identifying an uninfected individual due to a false-negative test was considerably reduced if negative tests were repeated 24 hours later. For a small false-positive test probability (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals was larger than the number of positive tests. For a higher false-positive test probability, the true number of infected individuals was smaller than the number of positive tests.ConclusionNP samples are more sensitive than OP samples. The later an infected individual is tested after symptom onset, the less likely they are to test positive. This has implications for identifying infected patients, contact tracing and discharging convalescing patients who are potentially still infectious.","Wikramaratna, Paul S; Paton, Robert S; Ghafari, Mahan; Lourenço, José",Euro surveill,753,11

We analyzed big data to investigate whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers have any significant effect on the risk of COVID-19. Population-based cohort study was conducted based on the prescription data from nationwide health insurance records. METHODS: We investigated the 1,374,381 residents aged &#8805; 40 years living in Daegu, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, between February and March 2020. Prescriptions of antihypertensive medication during the year before the outbreak were extracted from the National Health Insurance Service registry. Medications were categorized by types and stratified by the medication possession ratios (MPRs) of antihypertensive medications after controlling for the potential confounders. The risk of COVID-19 was estimated using a difference in difference analysis. RESULTS: Females, older individuals, low-income earners, and recently hospitalized patients had a higher risk of infection. Patients with higher MPRs of antihypertensive medications had a consistently lower risk of COVID-19 than those with lower MPRs of antihypertensive medications and non-users. Among patients who showed complete compliance, there was a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 for those prescribed angiotensin II receptor blockers (relative risk [RR], 0.751; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.587-0.960) or calcium channel blockers (RR, 0.768; 95% CI, 0.601-0.980). CONCLUSION: Renin-angiotensin system blockers or other antihypertensive medications do not increase the risk of COVID-19. Patients should not stop antihypertensive medications, including renin-angiotensin system blockers, because of concerns of COVID-19.","Kim, Jaiyong; Kim, Dong Wook; Kim, Kwang Il; Kim, Hong Bin; Kim, Jong Hun; Lee, Yong Gab; Byeon, Kyeong Hyang; Cheong, Hae Kwan",J Korean Med Sci,753,16

Here, four HI patterns after CP resection based on endoscopic observation were introduced. A total of 131 CP cases treated with endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) were reviewed retrospectively and divided into four HI patterns: no-HI, mild-HI, unilateral-HI and bilateral-HI, according to intraoperative findings. The outcomes were evaluated and compared between groups in terms of weight gain, endocrine status, electrolyte disturbance and neuropsychological function before and after surgery. A systematic correlation was found between CP origin and subsequent HI patterns. The majority of intrasellar and suprasellar stalk origins lead to a no-HI pattern, the central-type CP mainly develops a mild or bilateral HI pattern, and the majority of tumors with hypothalamic stalk origins result in unilateral HI and sometimes bilateral HI patterns. The proportion of tumors with a maximum diameter >3 cm in the no-HI group was higher than that in the mild-HI group, BMI and quality of life in the no-HI group showed better results than those in the other groups. The incidence of new-onset diabetes insipidus in the bilateral-HI group was significantly higher than that in the other groups. Memory difficulty was observed mainly in the unilateral-HI and bilateral-HI groups. However, the outcomes of electrolyte disturbance, sleep, and cognitive disorder in the unilateral-HI group were significantly better than those in the bilateral-HI group. This study suggests the possibility of using pre- and intraoperative observation of CP origin to predict four HI patterns and even subsequent outcomes after tumor removal.","Yang, Le; Xie, ShenHao; Tang, Bin; Wu, Xiao; Tong, ZhiGao; Fang, Chao; Ding, Han; Bao, YouYuan; Zheng, SuYue; Hong, Tao",Cancer med,753,20

Undoubtedly, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought the world to a temporary halt, with its attendant bruises mostly notable on the economies of almost all African countries. This paper empirically analyse the incapacitation of African states in providing some strategic responses to the economic wreckages caused by the pandemic. Using technological-determinism as a theoretical framework, this study suggests the technological-innovation pathway as a bridge between the pandemic-induced economic circumstances and prosperity for Africa. Sequentially, the five junctions on the pathway splits as pulling, recovery, innovations, growth, and sustainability (PRIGS), but, however, the kernel of the discussion revolves around the commodification of innovation (technology) for Africa's economic growth and development. This study concludes, the five junctions on the PRIGS' highway absorbs the current developmental challenges of African states and hence, recommends an alternative roadmap for Africa, in its long-term quest and vision for development.","Aduloju, A.

The allometric increase with tree diameter assumed in ecological models would substantially overestimate seed contributions from large trees if fecundity eventually declines with size. Current estimates are dominated by overrepresentation of small trees in regression models. We combined global fecundity data, including a substantial representation of large trees. We compared size-fecundity relationships against traditional allometric scaling with diameter and two models based on crown architecture. All allometric models fail to describe the declining rate of increase in fecundity with diameter found for 80% of 597 species in our analysis. The strong evidence of declining fecundity, beyond what can be explained by crown architectural change, is consistent with physiological decline.

The rapid growth of the internet has ushered in an era of big data and the rational use of the internet. Meanwhile, due to the COVID-19 epidemic, onsite education has been forced to adapt to online programs, including the health education of GDM. Methods: We developed an innovative mobile application (app) that combines a teaching model of the flipped classroom and GDM management, which allows pregnant women to learn knowledge about GDM and prevent GDM to a certain degree. It turns passive learners into active learners, leads them to preview before class, and takes the lead in the classroom, mobilizing learners' enthusiasm to achieve good teaching results. Results: The implementation of the online gestational diabetes flipped classroom is an innovative attempt in this field. The described approach is especially relevant in the context of the ongoing global pandemic, accelerates knowledge transfer, improves patients' learning motivation, has a health promotion effect, and boosts patients' self-management efficiency. This app can overcome the treatment barriers for those patients that cannot go to the hospital, enhance health promotion efforts, and improve GDM management. Mobile healthcare promotes doctor-patient interaction, facilitates the monitoring of and feedback on conditions, and facilitates the adjustment of patient treatment plans. Conclusions: This model of combining gestational diabetes health education with a mobile app is an exemplary approach now, and it can be promoted to other disciplines.","Feng, G.; Huang, F.; Chen, Q.; Zhong, Q.; Liu, T.; Hao, D.; Yan, N.; Jian, T.; Ming, W.

Temporary changes to the diagnostic testing for GDM have been recommended for the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to identify what proportion of women with GDM would be missed by the COVID-19 GDM screening criteria. Secondly an analysis of the relationship between HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and pregnancy outcomes will be completed. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of all GDM patients at an Australian secondary hospital between January 2019 and February 2020. The proportion of women with GDM who would have been missed using the COVID-19 guidelines was assessed. Patients were divided into groups according to how their GDM was managed during the pregnancy: Diet, Metformin (MF), Insulin and MF + Insulin groups. Differences between the groups were compared using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc analysis was completed using the Bonferroni test. Logistic regression was employed to further compare the differences between the groups. RESULTS: The study group comprised 237 patients. Sixty patients (25.3%) would not have had GDM detected in their pregnancy using the COVID-19 guidelines. FBG was the most significant predictor for intervention with medication for GDM (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: HbA1c and FBG are poor screening tests for GDM. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the OGTT should be given clinical priority in high risk patients. Elevated FBG is a significant predictor for needing medical management and could be used in the future to better enable individualised treatment.","Zhu, Stephanie; Meehan, Tom; Veerasingham, Mayooran; Sivanesan, Kanapathippillai",Diabetes Metab Syndr,753,16

Therefore, there is a need to curb the spread of coronavirus. Accordingly, countries are enforcing partial or full-fledged lockdown to restrict all sorts of socialization. However, studies reported that people have despised the ordinances. The study assessed the economic, societal, and psychological impacts of the pandemic and the practice of abiding by curfews by staying and working from home. One hundred thirty-three government, private, and self-employed workers have anonymously and voluntarily completed an online survey. The change in lifestyle associated with the pandemic influenced the working group economically, socially, emotionally, and spiritually. In addition to inflation in the prices of food and commodity, workers have spent unintended costs for the prevention of the COVID-19 such as hand sanitizer and facemask. Furthermore, staying home was unbearable for the majority of the respondents and led to stress, boredom, and confined feelings which forced them to leave their homes to liberate themselves. Nevertheless, flexibility in time management, reduced commuting, and being safe from COVID-19 made the lockdown advantageous for some of the respondents. Telecommuting is influenced by factors such as home suitability to work, availability of supplies, and the behavior of the workers. Home suitability to work and access to vital working facilities varied between government, private, and self-employed individuals. Government employees exceptionally lack appropriate homes and resources to work. Therefore, to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on people's life it is important to make timely adjustments to the enforced orders to make them more productive.","Mulugeta, Tewodros Tadesse Elazar Shegute Tewodros Desta Takele Taye",Heliyon,753,32

Here we investigated the associations between pandemic-related income loss with financial strain and mental health trajectories over a 1-month course, in two independent cohorts. METHODS: Two independent studies were conducted in the U.S and in Israel at the beginning of the outbreak (March-April 2020, T1; study I: N = 2904, study II: N = 1267) and at a 1-month follow-up (T2; study I: N = 1318, study II: N = 241). Mixed-effects models were applied to assess associations among COVID-19-related income loss, financial strain, and pandemic-related worries about health, with anxiety and depression, controlling for multiple covariates including pre-COVID-19 income. RESULTS: In both studies, income loss and financial strain were associated with greater depressive symptoms at T1, above and beyond T1 anxiety, worries about health, and pre-COVID-19 income. Worsening of income loss was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in both studies. Worsening of subjective financial strain was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in one study (US). CONCLUSIONS: Income loss and financial strain were uniquely associated with depressive symptoms and their exacerbation over time, above and beyond pandemic-related anxiety. In times when a myriad of stressors are affecting mental health worldwide, our findings reveal specific links between the economic impact of COVID-19 and psychiatric outcomes.","Hertz-Palmor, Nimrod; Moore, Tyler M; Gothelf, Doron; DiDomenico, Grace E; Dekel, Idit; Greenberg, David M; Brown, Lily A; Matalon, Noam; Visoki, Elina; White, Lauren K; Himes, Megan M; Schwartz-Lifshitz, Maya; Gross, Raz; Gur, Ruben C; Gur, Raquel E; Pessach, Itai M; Barzilay, Ran",J Affect Disord,753,26

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Crucial treatments were delayed for many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, over concerns for hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections. To protect cancer patients whose survival depended on timely surgery, a ""COVID-minimal pathway"" was created. METHODS: Patients who underwent a surgical procedure on the pathway between April and May 2020 were evaluated. The ""COVID-minimal surgical pathway"" consisted of: (A) evolving best-practices in COVID-19 transmission-reduction, (B) screening patients and staff, (C) preoperative COVID-19 patient testing, (D) isolating pathway patients from COVID-19 patients. Patient status through 2 weeks from discharge was determined as a reflection of hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: After implementation, pathway screening processes excluded 7 COVID-19-positive people from interacting with pathway (4 staff and 3 patients). Overall, 122 patients underwent 125 procedures on pathway, yielding 83 admissions (42 outpatient procedures). The median age was 64 (56-79) and 57% of patients were female. The most common surgical indications were cancer affecting the uterus, genitourinary tract, colon, lung or head and neck. The median length of admission was 3 days (1-6). Repeat COVID-19 testing performed on 27 patients (all negative), including 9 patients evaluated in an emergency room and 8 readmitted patients. In the postoperative period, no patient developed a COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: A COVID-minimal pathway comprised of physical space modifications and operational changes may allow urgent cancer treatment to safely continue during the COVID-19 pandemic, even during the surge-phase.","Boffa, Daniel J; Judson, Benjamin L; Billingsley, Kevin G; Del Rossi, Erin; Hindinger, Kasey; Walters, Samantha; Ermer, Theresa; Ratner, Elena; Mitchell, Marci R; Laurans, Maxwell S; Johnson, Dirk C; Yoo, Peter S; Morton, John M; Zurich, Holly B; Davis, Kimberly; Ahuja, Nita",Ann Surg,753,21

Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is used to support ARDS patients failing conventional management. Scoring systems to predict mortality in VV-ECMO remain unvalidated in COVID-19 ARDS. We describe the largest COVID-19 VV-ECMO single-center experience to date and assess the utility of standard risk calculators. METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospective database of all COVID-19 VV-ECMO patients, cannulated between March 15th and June 27th, 2020, at a single academic center was performed. Demographic, clinical, and ECMO characteristics were collected. The primary outcome was in hospital mortality; survivor and non-survivor cohorts were compared utilizing univariate and bivariate analyses. RESULTS: Forty COVID-19 ECMO patients were identified. Of the 33 patients (82.5%) off ECMO at time of analysis, 18 patients (54.5%) survived to hospital discharge and 15 (45.5%) died on ECMO. Non-survivors presented with a statistically significant higher Prediction of Survival on ECMO Therapy (PRESET)-Score (mean ± standard deviation 8.33 ± 0.8 vs. 6.17 ± 1.8, P = 0.001). The PRESET-Score demonstrated accurate mortality prediction. All patients with a PRESET-Score of &#8804; 6 survived, and a score &#8805; 7 was associated with a dramatic increase in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest favorable outcomes are possible in COVID-19 ECMO patients at high volume centers. This study is the first to demonstrate an association between the PRESET-Score and survival in COVID-19 VV-ECMO patients. Standard risk calculators may aid in appropriate COVID-19 ARDS patient selection for ECMO.","Tabatabai, Ali; Ghneim, Mira H; Kaczorowski, David J; Shah, Aakash; Dave, Sagar; Haase, Daniel J; Vesselinov, Roumen; Deatrick, Kristopher B; Rabin, Joseph; Rabinowitz, Ronald P; Galvagno, Samuel; O039,; Connor, James V; Menaker, Jay; Herr, Daniel L; Gammie, James S; Scalea, Thomas M; Madathil, Ronson J",Ann. thorac. surg,753,16

SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed by viral Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and she received remdesivir and COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Initial echocardiogram (ECHO) demonstrated low normal left ventricular function and mild left anterior descending coronary artery dilation. She remained hypotensive, despite high-dose epinephrine and norepinephrine infusions as well as stress-dose hydrocortisone. Admission SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay was positive, meeting the criteria for MIS-C. An ECHO 9 hours after admission demonstrated a severe decline in left ventricular function. Due to severe cardiogenic shock, she was cannulated for venoarterial extracorporeal support (ECMO). During her ECMO course, she was treated with remdesivir, intravenous methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin, and anakinra. She was decannulated on ECMO day 7, extubated the following day, and discharged home 2 weeks later without respiratory or cardiac support.

We consider a scenario with two localities where disease originates in one locality and is exported to the neighboring locality via travel of exposed (latently infected) individuals. We establish a lower bound on the outbreak size at the origin as a function of the speed of spread. Using the lower bound on the outbreak size at the origin, we establish an upper bound on the outbreak size at the importing locality as a function of the speed of spread and the level of preparedness for the low mobility regime. We evaluate the critical levels of preparedness that stop the disease from spreading at the importing locality. Finally, we show how the benefit of preparedness diminishes under high mobility rates. Our results highlight the importance of preparedness at localities where cases are beginning to rise such that localities can help stop local outbreaks when they respond to the severity of outbreaks in neighboring localities.","Eksin, Ceyhun; Ndeffo-Mbah, Martial; Weitz, Joshua S",J Theor Biol,753,20

ARDS is defined as the onset of hypoxemia, tachypnea, and loss of lung compliance due to some stimulus. In the United States, the incidence of ARDS has been growing because it is being increasingly recognized. The incidence of ARDS has also gone up recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: To date, there is no known one treatment for ARDS. Multiple studies have looked into various causes of ARDS, pathophysiology, and ventilation and management strategies. However, there is still considerable variability in the treatment and management of these patients from institution to institution. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted through PubMed and Google Scholar. Publications describing the epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology, and treatment were included in this review. RESULTS: The definition of ARDS has evolved over the years. The most recent and agreed upon diagnostic criteria are based on the Berlin criteria for ARDS. Management of patients with ARDS includes low tidal volume ventilation, prone ventilation, paralysis in certain patient populations, and perhaps extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This also applies to patients with ARDS due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ARDS have a high mortality due to the incredibly complex disease process. Because of the complexity of ARDS, the management and treatment is equally as difficult. This article reviews some of the strategies used to date, including the role of ECMO, and includes some society recommendations. Further research must be done into which methods best guide lung ventilation in severe ARDS and patients on ECMO.","Hasan, Zubair",Am J Ther,753,1

The lockdown caused by COVID-19 also significantly impacted three main elements in UGM education processes, including teaching, research, and community service, where most of their activities involving a large group of people, field, and outdoor programs. Innovation in learning, research, and community service without mobility from home is needed to overcome the impact of Covid-19. Methods of internet-based learning, research, and community service must be established during the pandemic to generate a reliable yet efficient blended program that can accommodate their outcomes. This paper will generally look at the initiative and strategy taken by UGM in planning and developing a sustainable research-based learning and community services. It is based on integrated research-based learning and community service, which integrates former individual education, research, and community service programs. The policy of considering COVID-19 as an emergency at UGM has eliminated teaching and learning activities on campus and replaced them with online learning activities from home. The application of the Three-Centra Education concept, which consists of families, schools, and communities, is truly relevant for developing research-based learning and service programs. Besides, academic and non-academic atmospheres to support integrated education, research, and community service processes in universities in the current era must be developed under millennial students’ style. The millennial approach's adjustment is possible by developing tutoring systems through student-centered learning with the edutainment process that triggers the learning system to be more enjoyable, but the quality is still maintained. This quality of online learning during an emergency in UGM has been improved based on conducted surveys indicating that the advantages of online lectures, according to students, are its flexibility and relaxation;no preparation needed to visit campus;more courageous to ask questions during lecture;most materials are well documented for rereading;time and cost-efficient. Meanwhile, online learning disadvantages covered the fact that the lectures confused with online assignments that caused an excessive workload;the lecturers need to be more interactive and communicative;the schedule should not be frequently changed until later evening, and decrease concentration ability among students. University leaders, the academic community, including alumni, have been building solidarity, compassion, and empathy through food assistance, credit, academic fee reduction, non-bureaucratic procedures for students affected by COVID-19. Co-learning system and work from home in the cyber campus 4.0 for the millennial student in the era of lockdown and destructive innovation with the support of sophisticated information technology and significant data access seems to be the most appropriate learning media. The empowerment online learning system must implement the principles of win–win solution, co-creation, co-finance, flexibility, and sustainability of the proposed programs to strengthen education's real meaning during this pandemic. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Ana, I.

No study has yet looked at the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the surgical research community. In this study, we sought to understand the impact of the pandemic and its associated restrictions on academic surgeons. METHODS: We surveyed members of the Association for Academic Surgery and the Society of University Surgeons. Survey questions included demographics, current challenges to basic and clinical research activities, attitudes toward remote work and productivity maintenance, and the solutions implemented to maintain productivity. RESULTS: Of 301 respondents, 70% cited a negative impact on research productivity due to mandatory building shutdowns, minimized personnel as a result of social distancing, and suspensions of animal work and clinical trials, with senior faculty and division chiefs and chairs more likely to report a negative impact (P = .001). Only 11% of respondents are documenting their financial losses, and only 19% indicated they received appropriate guidance regarding why and how to monitor the financial impact of the pandemic. Researchers have attempted to maintain research productivity through a focus on remote work, including manuscript writing, grant writing, and data analysis. Some participants have found silver linings, including more time to dedicate to research and family as a result of fewer clinical duties. CONCLUSION: Productivity strategies developed during the pandemic, including writing, remote work and meetings, and structured scheduling, are lessons that will allow the surgical research community to be resilient in the face of future disruptions.","Keswani, Sundeep G; Parikh, Umang M; Gosain, Ankush; Ghaferi, Amir A; Thomas, Jayshree S; Dudeja, Vikas; Kim, Eugene S; Zuckerbraun, Brian S; Goldstein, Allan M",Surgery (St. Louis),753,16

Introduction: the inferior alveolar dental nerve block is the method most commonly used by endodontists to achieve local anesthesia during treatments. This study compared the efficacy of two anesthetic solutions: 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine and 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in patients with different pulp diagnoses requiring endodontic treatment. Method: an interventional, randomized clinical trial. The sample included 36 patients who were treated at the postgraduate endodontics service at the Universidad de Cartagena in the year 2016. Descriptive statistics and the X 2 test were used for data analysis, using a limit of 0.05. Results: articaine showed a greater anesthetic effect in vestibular mucosa (88.9%) and tip of tongue (55.6%), compared with lidocaine. The rates of anesthetic success in the lidocaine and articaine groups were 5.6% and 22.2% respectively, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.633). In teeth with normal pulp, the efficacy was 27.3%, and this value considerably decreased in teeth with asymptomatic and symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, with percentages of 5.8% and 12.5% respectively, although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.276). Conclusions: no statistically significant differences were found in the anesthetic efficacy of 2% lidocaine and 4% articaine in lower molars with vital pulp. However, articaine showed a better anesthetic success rate. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the anesthetic efficacy in molars with normal pulp and molars with inflamed pulp-although the percentage of success in normal pulp was greater than in teeth with irreversible pulpitis.","Martínez-Martínez, Adel; Freyle-Granados, Evelyn; Senior-Carmona, Natalia",Rev.

This resulted in unprecedented reductions in anthropogenic activity, and reduced emissions of certain air pollutants, namely oxides of nitrogen. The UK 'lockdown' was enforced on 23/03/2020, which led to restrictions on movement, social interaction, and 'non-essential' businesses and services. This study employed an ensemble of measurement and modelling techniques to investigate changes in air quality, atmospheric composition and boundary layer reactivity in the South East of the UK post-lockdown. The techniques employed included in-situ gas- and particle-phase monitoring within central and local authority air quality monitoring networks, remote sensing by long path Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy and Sentinel-5P's TROPOMI, and detailed 0-D chemical box modelling. Findings showed that de-trended NO2 concentrations decreased by an average of 14-38% when compared to the mean of the same period over the preceding 5-years. We found that de-trended particulate matter concentrations had been influenced by interregional pollution episodes, and de-trended ozone concentrations had increased across most sites, by up to 15%, such that total Ox levels were roughly preserved. 0-D chemical box model simulations showed the observed increases in ozone concentrations during lockdown under the hydrocarbon-limited ozone production regime, where total NOx decreased proportionally greater than total non-methane hydrocarbons, which led to an increase in total hydroxyl, peroxy and organic peroxy radicals. These findings suggest a more complex scenario in terms of changes in air quality owing to the COVID-19 lockdown than originally reported and provide a window into the future to illustrate potential outcomes of policy interventions seeking large-scale NOx emissions reductions without due consideration of other reactive trace species.","Wyche, K P; Nichols, M; Parfitt, H; Beckett, P; Gregg, D J; Smallbone, K L; Monks, P S",Sci Total Environ,753,26

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the changes in urinalysis of COVID-19 patients with normal kidney function. METHODS: The data of COVID-19 patients with normal renal functions were retrospectively analyzed. Urinalysis parameters of these patients were recorded. The patients were divided into three groups as mild, moderate and severe with respect to the clinical course of the disease. It was examined whether the urine analysis values in the groups were different from normal reference values and whether these values were different between the groups. In addition, possible relationship between the urinalysis parameters and the clinical severity of the disease was investigated. RESULTS: There are three groups; mild (n:40), moderate (n:38) and severe (n:42). Mean age were significantly higher in the severe group, while gender distribution of the groups was similar. (p=0.033) (p=0.091) Creatinine values of all patients were normal.

Although previous data revealed characteristics of GI symptoms in COVID-19, for patients with only GI symptoms onset, their diagnostic process and potential transmission risk are still unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 205 COVID-19 cases from January 16 to March 30, 2020, in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. All patients were confirmed by virus nuclei acid tests. The clinical features and laboratory and chest tomographic (CT) data were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 171 patients with classic symptoms (group A) and 34 patients with only GI symptoms (group B) were included. In patients with classical COVID-19 symptoms, GI symptoms occurred more frequently in severe cases compared to non-severe cases (20/43 vs. 91/128, respectively, p < 0.05). In group B, 91.2% (31/34) patients were non-severe, while 73.5% (25/34) patients had obvious infiltrates in their first CT scans.

The role of simulation-based training (SBT) during such a pandemic becomes more relevant for teaching a team approach and building capacity especially when there is a threat to health care workers due to aerosol generation and there is a huge demand for manpower during the pandemic. Objective To assess the effectiveness of a simulation-based training program in improving knowledge and concept of teamwork of health care workers involved in airway management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Methods After institutional review committee approval, a prospective analytical study was conducted in the department of medical education on participants from various specialties undergoing COVID-19 airway training. The purpose of the study was to assess team dynamics during simulation scenarios and compare test scores at baseline, immediately post-training, and seven days post-training (using online forms). Scores were compared using the Friedman test followed by post-hoc testing. Sub-group comparison was done using an unpaired t-test. Results Median scores were significantly higher in the immediate post-training test and seven days post-training test (online) compared to baseline pretest scores in the overall participant group and in individual sub-groups. There was no significant difference in immediate versus seven-day post-training test scores overall and in all subgroups. In the sub-group comparisons, median improvement in score was significantly better in the non-anesthesia group and in the resident group. It was observed that team performance in terms of role clarity, closed-loop communication, and idea acceptance improved substantially during the subsequent scenarios. Conclusion Simulation-based training was effective in improving knowledge and team dynamics amongst health care workers regarding airway management in COVID-19 patients, with retention of up to one week.

RESULTS: Of the 50 respondents, 44% (n = 22) were able to identify the DTRPs. DTRP identification by pharmacists was associated with labeling [chi-square = 7.879, p value = 0.019], reconciliation [chi-square = 10.359, p value = 0.001], counseling standard [chi-square = 19.09, p = 0.000] and physician visit suggestion [chi-square = 31.15, p = 0.000]. The labeling standards for prescriptions with DTRPs were “low” in five (50%), “average“ in three (30%) and “good” in two (20%) of the cases with wrong dose. Average counseling time of the CPs was 80.38 ± 71.61 seconds. The counseling standard had no significant association with counseling time [chi-square = 34.79, p = 0.250] and use of drug information sources [chi-square = 2.86, p = 0.243]. Average time spent in dispensing is 74.4 ± 73.05 seconds. None (n = 0) of the CPs communicated with the physician, and only five out of 50 (10%) of CPs checked any DI sources. However, in 19 (38%) cases, the CPs recommended the SPs to consult their physician prior to taking the medications. CONCLUSION: CPs were generally able to identify DTRPs and mitigate DTRPs by recommending physician consultation. Nevertheless, there were no professional collaborations between the SPs and physicians. The dispensing and counseling standards were not appreciable.","Palaian, Subish; Buabeid, Manal; Ashames, Akram",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,753,21

User awareness, along with legislative reforms and enforcement measures, would reduce the incidence of crashes and injuries. This study aims to test the effectiveness of an awareness-raising model regarding helmet use for motorcycle taxi drivers. METHODS: This is a quasi-experimental study that will take place in the cities of Parakou (intervention group) and Porto Novo (control group). Over a three-month period, a package of awareness-raising activities will be implemented in the intervention area, targeting a group of motorcycle taxi drivers. The messages to be developed for awareness-raising will focus on the most frequently influencing factors, as identified by the baseline collection. These key messages will be disseminated through various tools and communication channels (banners, motorcycle stickers and motorcycle taxi uniforms, interactive sessions). Data will be collected prospectively via a self-reported questionnaire and observation, carried out before the intervention, at the end, and 6 months later. The data will relate to knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding helmet use. The analysis will compare the indicators between the groups, as well as between the pre- and post-intervention phase. The KoboCollect software will be used for data entry and processing, and Stata 15 will be used for data analysis. Chi-square or Fisher, Student’s or Kruskal-Wallis tests will be used for the comparisons. The difference-in-difference method will be used to determine the specific effect of the awareness activities. DISCUSSION: This study will assess the contribution of awareness messages to changing the behaviour of motorcycle taxi drivers by determining the specific effect of the intervention.","Dos Santos, Bella Hounkpe; Kpozehouen, Alphonse; Ahanhanzo, Yolaine Glele; Daddah, Donatien; Ouendo, Edgard-Marius; Leveque, Alain; Coppieters, Yves",BMC Public Health,753,16

While natural opium has been regarded safe to a great extent among traditional communities, concerns are emerging owing to the available evidence of QT prolongation that have been exposed during recent outcome surveillance of patients under opioid use. Potential QT prolonging interactions would raise a higher level of such concern in opium users during COVID pandemic and warrant attention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed to detect the prevalence of QTc prolongation among opium users and nonusers. Two groups were compared with regard to gender, age, and median QTc interval. Normal and prolonged QTc intervals of user group were compared with respect to age, sex, dose of opium consumption, and duration of opium consumption. RESULTS: 123 opium users and 39 controls were investigated. Median QTc interval in opium user and non-user group was 460 vs 386 milliseconds, respectively (p value < 0.001). In all, 59.3%, (95% CI: 50.51–67.62%) of cases and none of non-user had prolonged QTc interval (p value < 0.001). There was no significance between normal and prolonged QTc intervals with respect to dose and duration of opium use. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that opium consumption is associated with QTc prolongation. This prolongation does not relate to dose and duration of opium use. Further study is propounded to assess the clinical significance of these results and to determine risk rating of opium compared to other opioids in this regard.

These may manifest as altered levels of consciousness, encephalopathy-like symptoms, delirium, and loss of various memory domains. Dysexecutive syndrome is a peculiar manifestation of ‘Cognitive COVID’ as well. In the previous major outbreaks of viruses like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and Influenza. There have been attempts to understand the underlying mechanisms describing the causality of similar symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review, therefore, is attempting to highlight the current understanding of the various direct and indirect mechanisms, focusing on the role of neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2, the general pro-inflammatory state, and the pandemic-associated psychosocial stressors in the causality of ‘Cognitive COVID.’ Neurotropism is associated with various mechanisms including retrograde neuronal transmission via olfactory pathway, a general hematogenous spread, and the virus using immune cells as vectors. The high amounts of inflammation caused by COVID-19, compounded with potential intubation, are associated with a deleterious effect on the cognition as well. Finally, the pandemic’s unique psychosocial impact has raised alarm due to its possible effect on cognition. Furthermore, with surfacing reports of post-COVID-vaccination cognitive impairments after vaccines containing mRNA encoding for spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesize their causality and ways to mitigate the risk. The potential impact on the quality of life of an individual and the fact that even a minor proportion of COVID-19 cases developing cognitive impairment could be a significant burden on already overwhelmed healthcare systems across the world make it vital to gather further evidence regarding the prevalence, presentation, correlations, and causality of these events and reevaluate our approach to accommodate early identification, management, and rehabilitation of patients exhibiting cognitive symptoms.","Ali Awan, Hashir; Najmuddin Diwan, Mufaddal; Aamir, Alifiya; Ali, Muneeza; Di Giannantonio, Massimo; Ullah, Irfan; Shoib, Sheikh; De Berardis, Domenico",J Clin Med,753,1

A web-based questionnaire survey was conducted in a cross-sectional design in RD patients and healthy controls. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to evaluate parental psychiatric status; while the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Child was used for children. Four hundred and fifty-nine patients with RD and their parents completed the present study, as well as 336 healthy peers. The age and gender of the children were similar across groups. Under 12 years of age, the trait anxiety of the children and the psychological symptoms of parents were similar across groups; while over 13 years of age, anxiety and depression scores of the parents, as well as trait anxiety of the children were higher than the control groups’ (7.3 ± 3.4 vs 6.3 ± 3.8, p = 0.006 for parental anxiety; 6.6 ± 3.8 vs. 5.3 ± 3.9, p < 0.001 for parental depression; 36.1 ± 8.7 vs. 33.3 ± 7.9, p = 0.002 for child trait anxiety). In patient group, there were no differences in scale scores according to variables such as rheumatological disease diagnosis, the consulting of doctor for treatment, thinking that RD increases the risk of COVID-19, the history of rheumatic disease attack during the pandemic process, and the use of biological agents. The children’s trait anxiety was positively correlated with their parents’ anxiety (r = 0.414, p < 0.001) and depression (r = 0.300, p < 0.001) scores. These findings suggest that clinicians should pay attention to the psychiatric symptoms of both children with RD and their parents during the pandemic.","Durcan, Gizem; Barut, Kenan; Haslak, Fatih; Doktur, Hilal; Yildiz, Mehmet; Adrovic, Amra; Sahin, Sezgin; Kasapcopur, Ozgur",Rheumatol Int,753,12

The full spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic disease to mild respiratory tract illness to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multisystem organ failure, and death. The efficacy of corticosteroids in viral ARDS remains unknown. We postulated that adjunctive treatment of established ARDS caused by COVID-19 with intravenous dexamethasone might change the pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response and thereby reduce morbidity, leading to a decrease in duration of mechanical ventilation and in mortality. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, parallel, open-label, superiority trial testing dexamethasone in 200 mechanically ventilated adult patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS caused by confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Established ARDS is defined as maintaining a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ≤ 200 mmHg on PEEP ≥ 10 cmH(2)O and FiO(2) ≥ 0.5 after 12 ± 3 h of routine intensive care. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone plus standard intensive care or standard intensive care alone. Patients in the dexamethasone group will receive an intravenous dose of 20 mg once daily from day 1 to day 5, followed by 10 mg once daily from day 6 to day 10. The primary outcome is 60-day mortality. The secondary outcome is the number of ventilator-free days, defined as days alive and free from mechanical ventilation at day 28 after randomization.

We investigate the impact of the pandemic and subsequent mobility changes on road traffic safety. Using traffic accident data from the city of Los Angeles and New York City, we find that the impact is not merely a blunt reduction in traffic and accidents; rather, (1) the proportion of accidents unexpectedly increases for “Hispanic” and “Male” groups; (2) the “hot spots” of accidents have shifted in both time and space and are likely moved from higher-income areas (e.g., Hollywood and Lower Manhattan) to lower-income areas (e.g., southern LA and southern Brooklyn); (3) the severity level of accidents decreases with the number of accidents regardless of transportation modes. Understanding those variations of traffic accidents not only sheds a light on the heterogeneous impact of COVID-19 across demographic and geographic factors, but also helps policymakers and planners design more effective safety policies and interventions during critical conditions such as the pandemic.","Lin, Lei; Shi, Feng; Li, Weizi",Sci Rep,753,16

The pathophysiological changes that result from elevated body weight lead to metabolic dysfunction, chronic inflammation, impaired immunological responses and multi-system disorders which increase vulnerability to severe illness from COVID-19. While vaccination strategies are underway across the world, the second and third waves of the pandemic, along with the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 strains, continue to threaten the stability of medical systems worldwide. Furthermore, evidence from previous pandemics suggests that vaccines are less effective in obese individuals than in their healthy-weight counterparts over the long-term. Therefore, a consideration of lifestyle changes that can boost metabolic health and immunity is critical to reduce the risk of complications and severe illness from viral infection. In this review we discuss the potential mechanisms linking excess body weight with COVID-19 morbidity. We also present evidence that intermittent fasting, a dietary program that has gained popularity in recent years, may be an effective strategy to improve metabolic health and immunity and thus reduce the impact of obesity on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.","Ealey, Kafi N.; Phillips, Joy; Sung, Hoon-Ki",Trends Endocrinol Metab,753,1

Automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from medical imaging enables precise medication, helps to control community outbreak, and reinforces coronavirus testing methods in place. While there exist several challenges in manually inferring traces of this viral infection from X-ray, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can mine data patterns that capture subtle distinctions between infected and normal X-rays. To enable automated learning of such latent features, a custom CNN architecture has been proposed in this research. It learns unique convolutional filter patterns for each kind of pneumonia. This is achieved by restricting certain filters in a convolutional layer to maximally respond only to a particular class of pneumonia/COVID-19. The CNN architecture integrates different convolution types to aid better context for learning robust features and strengthen gradient flow between layers. The proposed work also visualizes regions of saliency on the X-ray that have had the most influence on CNN’s prediction outcome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in deep learning to learn custom filters within a single convolutional layer for identifying specific pneumonia classes.

The present study aimed to describe the psychological impact of the crisis on our sample of young Swiss men and to examine differences due to their linguistic region, experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and living arrangements. METHODS Based on an ongoing cohort study, we assessed a general-population sample of young Swiss men (n = 2345; average 29 years old) shortly before (from April 2019) and early on during the COVID-19 crisis (between 13 May and 8 June 2020). This was a unique opportunity to estimate the crisis' psychological impact in the form of depression, perceived stress and sleep quality (assessed before and during COVID-19), and any crisis-induced fears, isolation or psychological trauma. Associations of psychological impact with living arrangements, experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and linguistic region (German-speaking vs French-speaking) were investigated using linear regression models. FINDINGS By the time participants responded to our questionnaire, less than 1% had been tested positive for COVID-19, 2.6% had been tested negative and 14.7% had had some COVID-19 symptoms but had not been tested. About 8.2% of the sample reported at least some symptoms of psychological trauma (≥24 points on the Impact of Event Scale). On average, participants reported higher levels of fear for others (43.6% at least moderate) and economic fear (12.7% at least moderate) than fear for themselves (5.8% at least moderate). Those living alone and those who reported having COVID-19 symptoms themselves, or knowing someone with symptoms, reported higher overall psychological impact in the form of depression, perceived stress, sleep quality, psychological trauma, fear and isolation. Associations with linguistic region varied by outcome, with higher levels of depression and fear in French-speaking regions and higher levels of perceived stress and isolation in German-speaking regions. INTERPRETATION The crisis had a considerable impact on the psychological well-being of our sample of young Swiss men, and some groups were more affected than others: those living alone and those who had shown COVID-19 symptoms themselves or had known someone with symptoms may have felt a greater psychological impact from the crisis. Supporting those at a higher risk of psychological consequences in such crises, whether through structural measures or via individual support, should be an important aspect of crisis management and could help reduce the overall impact of the current pandemic on Switzerland's population.","Marmet, Simon; Wicki, Matthias; Gmel, Gerhard; Gachoud, Céline; Daeppen, Jean-Bernard; Bertholet, Nicolas; Studer, Joseph",Swiss medical weekly,753,1

As there have been no prior studies on the acceptance of telemedicine by pregnant women, we conducted this survey to investigate the same. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous questionnaire survey of pregnant women who underwent telemedicine check‐ups from March 4 to June 30, 2020, using a mobile fetal heart rate monitor and video call system through the Hokkaido University Hospital. RESULTS: Out of the 77 individuals who received prenatal telemedicine check‐ups, 54 individuals (70%) had complications, and 64 individuals (83%) consented for the questionnaire survey. In the video call system, 18 individuals (28%) were found to be unwell and 17 individuals (27%) experienced difficulty using the mobile fetal heart rate monitoring device. Assuming scores for face‐to‐face consultations were five out of 10, the mean score for satisfaction was 4.2, but 19 (30%) women felt equal or greater satisfaction with face‐to‐face consultations. If not for the threat of COVID‐19, only four individuals (6%) proactively expressed a desire for telemedicine, with a significantly less demand observed among primiparous women than multiparous women. The permissible additional financial burden enabling telemedicine was $10 or less for 80% of subjects. CONCLUSION: In this small preliminary study, 30% of the pregnant women felt equal or greater satisfaction with telemedicine than face‐to‐face consultations. A stronger demand for telemedicine was exhibited by multiparous women than primiparous women. Thus, a system that would be advantages by limiting subjects and enabling low‐cost examinations is required for making perinatal telemedicine more popular.","Nakagawa, Kinuko; Umazume, Takeshi; Mayama, Michinori; Chiba, Kentaro; Saito, Yoshihiro; Noshiro, Kiwamu; Morikawa, Mamoru; Yoshino, Masanori; Watari, Hidemichi",J Obstet Gynaecol Res,753,19

AI based designs, which utilizes chest X-rays, have been recently proposed for the detection of COVID-19. However, these approaches are either using non-public database or having a complex design. In this study we have proposed a novel framework for real time detection of coronavirus patients without manual intervention. In our framework, we have introduced a 3-step process in which initially K-means clustering, and feature extraction is performed as a data pre-processing step. In the second step, the selected features are optimized by a novel feature optimization approach based on hybrid differential evolution algorithm and particle swarm optimization. The optimized features are then feed forwarded to SVM classifier. Empirical results show that our proposed model is able to achieve 99.34% accuracy. This shows that our model is robust and sustainable in diagnosis of COVID-19 infected individual.","Dixit, Abhishek; Mani, Ashish; Bansal, Rohit",Inf Sci (N Y),753,26

One of the most promising, if they can be successfully developed, is vaccines. While the technological development of such countermeasures is currently underway, a key social gap remains. Past experience in routine and crisis contexts demonstrates that uptake of vaccines is more complicated than simply making the technology available. Vaccine uptake, and especially the widespread acceptance of vaccines, is a social endeavor that requires consideration of human factors. To provide a starting place for this critical component of a future COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the United States, the 23-person Working Group on Readying Populations for COVID-19 Vaccines was formed. One outcome of this group is a synthesis of the major challenges and opportunities associated with a future COVID-19 vaccination campaign and empirically-informed recommendations to advance public understanding of, access to, and acceptance of vaccines that protect against SARS-CoV-2. While not inclusive of all possible steps than could or should be done to facilitate COVID-19 vaccination, the working group believes that the recommendations provided are essential for a successful vaccination program.","Schoch-Spana, Monica; Brunson, Emily K.; Long, Rex; Ruth, Alexandra; Ravi, Sanjana J.; Trotochaud, Marc; Borio, Luciana; Brewer, Janesse; Buccina, Joseph; Connell, Nancy; Hall, Laura Lee; Kass, Nancy; Kirkland, Anna; Koonin, Lisa; Larson, Heidi; Lu, Brooke Fisher; Omer, Saad B.; Orenstein, Walter A.; Poland, Gregory A.; Privor-Dumm, Lois; Quinn, Sandra Crouse; Salmon, Daniel; White, Alexandre",Vaccine,753,28

Increased risk of pulmonary embolism and thrombosis has been identified in COVID-19 patients, alongside accompanying elevations in potential prognostic biomarkers, including D-dimer, IL-6 and cardiac specific troponins. Our aim was to provide a scoping review of the available literature regarding thrombosis risk, other cardiovascular implications, and their biomarkers in COVID-19 to highlight potential disease mechanisms. Methods Authors conducted a literature search in PubMed using MeSH headings “disseminated intravascular coagulation”, “pulmonary embolism”, “thromb*”, “stroke”, “myocardial infarction” and “acute lung injury”, as well as terms ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""2019 novel coronavirus"" and ""2019-nCoV"". Results and Conclusions COVID-19 disease is characterised by the interactions between hyperactive coagulation and complement systems – induced by hyper-inflammatory conditions, resulting in a pro-thrombotic state and diffuse tissue injury. There are several promising prognostic markers of disease severity, with D-dimer the most significant. The presence of thrombocytopenia appears to be a key indicator of patient deterioration. Further research is required to understand the underlying pathophysiology in COVID-19 and its implications in disease progression and patient management. Randomised trials are urgently needed to determine the safety of proposed therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin and the role for anti-platelet agents, such as Ticagrelor, in patient management.","Page, Eden M.; Ariëns, Robert A.S.",Thromb Res,753,24

For many decades, AMDs have been widely used in the treatment of malaria and various other anti-inflammatory diseases, particularly to treat autoimmune disorders of the connective tissue. The review comprises in vitro and in vivo studies, original studies, clinical trials, and consensus reports for the analysis, which were available in medical databases (e.g., PubMed). This manuscript summarizes the current knowledge about chloroquine (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and shows the difference between their use, activity, recommendation, doses, and adverse effects on two groups of patients: those with rheumatic and viral diseases (including COVID-19). In the case of connective tissue disorders, AMDs are prescribed for a prolonged duration in small doses, and their effect is observed after few weeks, whereas in the case of viral infections, they are prescribed in larger doses for a short duration to achieve a quick saturation effect. In rheumatic diseases, AMDs are well tolerated, and their side effects are rare. However, in some viral diseases, the effect of AMDs is questionable or not so noticeable as suggested during the initial prognosis. They are mainly used as an additive therapy to antiviral drugs, but recent studies have shown that AMDs can diminish the efficacy of some antiviral drugs and may cause respiratory, kidney, liver, and cardiac complications.","Grygiel-Górniak, Bogna",Clin Rheumatol,753,16

Patients presenting with acute respiratory failure, particularly when tidal volume is restricted during mechanical ventilation, may experience the most distressing form of dyspnea known as air hunger. Air hunger activates brain pathways known to be involved in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. These conditions are considered part of the post-intensive care syndrome. These sequelae may be even more prevalent among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Low tidal volume, a mainstay of modern therapy for ARDS is difficult to avoid and is likely to cause air hunger despite sedation. Adjunctive neuromuscular blockade does not prevent or relieve air hunger, but it does prevent the patient from communicating discomfort to caregivers. Consequently, paralysis may also contribute to the development of PTSD. Although research has identified post-ARDS PTSD as a cause for concern and investigators have taken steps to quantify the burden of disease, there is little information to guide mechanical ventilation strategies designed to reduce its occurrence. We suggest such efforts will be more successful if they are directed at the known mechanisms of air hunger. Investigation of the anti-dyspnea effects of sedative and analgesic drugs commonly used in the ICU and their impact on post-ARDS PTSD symptoms is a logical next step. While in practice we often accept negative consequences of life-saving therapies as unavoidable, we must understand the negative sequalae of our therapies and work to minimize them under our primary directive to “first, do no harm” to our patients.","Worsham, Christopher M.; Banzett, Robert B.; Schwartzstein, Richard",Chest,753,20

In India, the number of cases is constantly increasing since the first case reported on January 30, 2020, resulting in a total of 81,997 cases including 2649 deaths as of May 14, 2020. To assist the government and healthcare sector in preventing the transmission of disease, it is necessary to predict the future confirmed cases. To predict the dynamics of COVID-19 cases, in this paper, we project the forecast of COVID-19 for five most affected states of India such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh using the real-time data. Using Holt–Winters method, a forecast of the number of confirmed cases in these states has been generated. Further, the performance of the method has been determined using RMSE, MSE, MAPE, MAE and compared with other standard algorithms. The analysis shows that the proposed Holt–Winters model generates RMSE value of 76.0, 338.4, 141.5, 425.9, 1991.5 for Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Tamil Nadu, which results in more accurate predictions over Holt’s Linear, Auto-regression (AR), Moving Average (MA) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. These estimations may further assist the government in employing strong policies and strategies for enhancing healthcare support all over India.","Swapnarekha, H.; Behera, Himansu Sekhar; Nayak, Janmenjoy; Naik, Bighnaraj; Kumar, P.

Traditional in vitro cell culture systems form one of the corner stones of cancer research. However, the growth of cancer cells in a two-dimensional pattern on a plastic dish in artificial conditions is not ideal, as the growth pattern significantly differs from that of a complex tumor in a patient. Hence, in recent years, efforts have been undertaken to generate more complex three-dimensional in vitro models, so-called organoid or tumoroid models, that more closely resemble the growth pattern and tumor heterogeneity observed in a patient. In this review, we summarize the efforts thus far undertaken in the area of NSCLC organoid development. ABSTRACT: Despite many developments in recent years, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Therefore, additional research, aiming to further elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of malignant transformation and development of therapy resistance, as well as the identification of additional novel therapeutic avenues, is crucial. For this purpose, reliable in vitro models are indispensable, as they allow for quick identification of suspected oncogenic drivers or evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies in a timely and cost-effective fashion. However, standard two-dimensional cell culture systems, the most frequently used in vitro model, are usually not truly representative of the situation in a patient as these models lack the tumor heterogeneity, the surrounding tumor microenvironment and the three-dimensional complexity of a tumor in vitro. For this reason, 3D cell culture systems, in particular organoids generated from normal non-malignant cells or tumor cell-based organoids (tumoroids), have in recent years gained much attention as alternative in vitro model systems that more closely resemble the actual primary tumor. In this review, we provide an overview of the available literature in the field of NSCLC organoids, which might still be in its infancy, but is gaining momentum.","Werner, Raphael S.; Kirschner, Michaela B.; Opitz, Isabelle",Cancers (Basel),753,20

The system allows conducting qualitative and semiquantitative analysis for 12 prokaryotic taxa that are prevalent in the human gut and associated with diseases, diet, age and other factors. The platform was validated by comparing microbiome profile data obtained with two different methods - the platform and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing - across 42 stool samples. The test can form the basis for precise and cost-efficient microbiome assay for large-scale surveys including clinical trials with interventions related to diet and disease risks.","Kurina, Irina; Popenko, Anna; Klimenko, Natalia; Koshechkin, Stanislav; Chuprikova, Liubov; Filipenko, Maxim; Tyakht, Alexander; Alexeev, Dmitry",Mol Cell Probes,753,1

DESIGN: A cross‐sectional survey was conducted online between February 7 and 10, 2020, with a convenience sample of 22,034 nurses working in 14 prefecture and city hospitals in Gansu Province, located in northwest China. METHODS: A self‐reported questionnaire with four parts (demographic characteristics, general questions related to novel coronavirus‐infected pneumonia, self‐rating anxiety scale, and self‐rating depression scale) was administered. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, means, and SDs were computed. The associations between anxiety and depression with sociodemographic characteristics, work‐related concerns, and impacts were analyzed, followed by multivariable logistic regression to identify factors that best predicted the nurses’ anxiety and depression levels. FINDINGS: A total of 21,199 questionnaires were checked to be valid, with an effective recovery rate of 96.21%. The mean ± SD age of the respondents was 31.89 ± 7.084 years, and the mean ± SD length of service was 9.40 ± 7.638 years. The majority of the respondents were female (98.6%) and married (73.1%). Some demographic characteristics, related concerns, and impacts of COVID‐19 were found to be significantly associated with both anxiety (p < .001) and depression (p < .001). Nurses who needed to take care of children or elderly relatives, took leave from work because they were worried about COVID‐19, avoided contact with family and friends, and wanted to obtain more COVID‐19‐related knowledge had higher levels of both anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that nurses faced with the COVID‐19 outbreak are at risk for experiencing anxiety and depression. Demographic background, psychosocial factors, and work‐related factors predicted the psychological responses. The family responsibilities and burdens of women may explain the higher levels of anxiety and depression among nurses with these obligations as compared to those without. On the other hand, nurses who chose not to take leave from work or who did not avoid going to work during this period were less anxious and depressed. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Professional commitment might be a protective factor for adverse psychological responses. It is pertinent to provide emotional support for nurses and recognize their professional commitment in providing service to people in need.","Han, Lin; Wong, Frances Kam Yuet; She, Dong Li M; Li, Si Yan; Yang, Yun Fang; Jiang, Meng Yao; Ruan, Yue; Su, Qian; Ma, Yuxia; Chung, Loretta Yuet Foon",J Nurs Scholarsh,753,10
