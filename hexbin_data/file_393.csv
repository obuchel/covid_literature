The objective of the present study was to evaluate the ability of oral immunization with a non-recombinant Lactococcus lactis displaying HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein, LL-HA1/L/AcmA, to induce mucosal immune responses and to accord protection against influenza virus infection in mice. The LL-HA1/L/AcmA was orally administered into mice and the immune response was evaluated. Mice immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA developed detectable specific sIgA in faecal extract, small intestine wash, BAL fluid and nasal fluid. The results obtained demonstrated that oral immunization of mice with LL-HA1/L/AcmA elicited mucosal immunity in both the gastrointestinal tract and the respiratory tract. The protective efficacy of LL-HA1/L/AcmA in immunized mice against a lethal dose challenge with influenza virus was also assessed. Upon challenge, the non-immunized group of mice showed high susceptibility to influenza virus infection. In contrast, 7/8 of mice orally immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA survived. In conclusion, oral administration of LL-HA1/L/AcmA in mice induced mucosal immunity and most importantly, provided protection against lethal influenza virus challenge. These results highlight the potential application of L. lactis as a platform for delivery of influenza virus vaccine.","Jee, Pui-Fong; Tiong, Vunjia; Shu, Meng-Hooi; Khoo, Jing-Jing; Wong, Won Fen; Abdul Rahim, Raha; AbuBakar, Sazaly; Chang, Li-Yen",PLoS One,393,1

Such interactions could be either synergistic or antagonistic, which subsequently determines the severity of the disease complex. The intensive rearing methods of poultry are responsible for the marked increase in avian respiratory diseases worldwide. The interaction between avian influenza with other pathogens can guarantee the continuous existence of other avian pathogens, which represents a global concern. A better understanding of the impact of the interaction between avian influenza virus and other avian respiratory pathogens provides a better insight into the respiratory disease complex in poultry and can lead to improved intervention strategies aimed at controlling virus spread.","Samy, Ahmed; Naguib, Mahmoud M.",Vet Sci,393,1

There is now considerable data on the cells and factors involved in fetal resorption but little is known about the events which activate this process. While the activation of the maternal response to the fetal implant could have endogenous or genetic origins, a role for exogenous factors including microbial pathogens could also be involved. In order to investigate these possibilities, the reproductive success of CBA/j♀ × DBA/2j♂ matings in a conventional animal care facility were compared with matings in a specific pathogen free (SPF) animal facility. All animals housed under these conditions were routinely screened by immunoassay and culture, for the presence of a number of viral and bacterial pathogens of mice. The incidence of spontaneous embryo loss in specific pathogen free CBA female mice mated by DBA and other male strains was found to be virtually identical to that of CBA female mice infected with multiple viral pathogens and housed under otherwise identical conditions (non-SPF). However, the numbers of implantation per pregnancy was significantly greater in an SPF facility. Therefore, exposure of mating mice to exogenous viral and bacterial pathogens did not appear to alter the overall incidence of spontaneous embryo resorption. It was concluded that the immunomodulatory effects of infection by common murine pathogens neither augmented nor reduced post-implantation embryo losses.","Baines, M.G.; Billingsley, K.A.; De Fougerolles, A.R.; Duclos, A.J.; Olney, H.J.; Pomerantz, D.K.; Gendron, R.L.",J Reprod Immunol,393,1

An accumulation of fat, followed by inflammation, is the major cause of NAFLD progression. During inflammation, macrophages are the most abundant immune cells recruited to the site of injury. Macrophages are classified into “proinflammatory” M1 macrophages, and “anti-inflammatory” M2 macrophages. In NAFLD, M1 macrophages are the most prominent macrophages that lead to an excessive inflammatory response. Previously, we found that baicalin could polarize macrophages into anti-inflammatory M2c subtype macrophages with an increased level of MERTK expression. Several studies have also shown a strong correlation between MERTK expression and cholesterol efflux, efferocytosis, as well as phagocytosis capability. Therefore, in this study, we aim to elucidate the potential and efficacy of mononuclear-cell (MNC)-derived MERTK(+/hi) M2c macrophages induced by baicalin as a cell-based therapy for NAFLD treatment. In our results, we have demonstrated that a MERTK(+/hi) M2c macrophage injection to NAFLD mice contributes to an increased level of serum HDL secretion in the liver, a decline in the circulating CD4(+)CD25(−) and CD8(+)CD25(−) T cells and lowers the total NAFLD pathological score by lessening the inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis. In the liver, profibrotic COL1A1 and FN, proinflammation TNFα, as well as the regulator of lipid metabolism PPARɣ expression, were also downregulated after injection. In parallel, the transcriptomic profiles of the injected MERTK(+/hi) M2c macrophages showed that the various genes directly or indirectly involved in NAFLD progression (e.g., SERPINE1, FADS2) were also suppressed. Downregulation of cytokines and inflammation-associated genes, such as CCR5, may promote a pro-resolving milieu in the NAFLD liver. Altogether, cell-based therapy using MERTK(+/hi) M2c macrophages is promising, as it ameliorates NAFLD in mice.","Junior,; Lai, Yin-Siew; Nguyen, Huyen Thi; Salmanida, Farrah P.; Chang, Ko-Tung",Int J Mol Sci,393,1

The fact that these evaluations are undertaken and accorded weight suggests that a critical value for designating pediatric vaccines as cost-effective (or not) must exist. For recommended pediatric vaccines, however, reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) have varied greatly, and there does not appear to be an explicit threshold used by the ACIP to define how much is too much to pay for the prevention of communicable diseases in children. Further complicating this issue is the fact that conventional ICER thresholds—expressed in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained—accord value only to length and quality of life and may not reflect our preferences as individuals or a society. For example, risk, an important attribute of many healthcare decisions, is ignored by the QALY model, as is the distribution of health benefits across different members of society. Are we indeed indifferent about risk and do we really believe that the value of disease prevention in children should be measured by the same “yardstick” as that for older adults? Accordingly, do we really believe that “a QALY is a QALY”? These issues, which are reviewed and discussed in this article, are more than just of theoretical interest; the answers impact how public health policy is determined, which impacts the lives and well-being of entire populations as well as the budgets of payers.","Amdahl, Jordan; Weycker, Derek; Farkouh, Ray; Huang, Liping; Eichten, Caitlin; Oster, Gerry",Infect Dis Ther,393,1

It is seen 1 out of 100,000 live births and makes up less than 1% of all chest wall deformities, seen more often among females. The deformity can be partial or complete. Partial deformities can be superior or inferior. It is generally diagnosed at birth when paradoxical respiratory movements are seen. Patients are often asymptomatic when they are born and generally other abnormalities accompany. As sternal clefts can be repaired primarily at early ages, they are repaired using autologous or synthetic grafts in the following years. We present a 2-month-old girl with superior partial sternal cleft repaired primary and accompanying hemangiomas in this case report. CASE PRESENTATION: A girl who was born in another center and had a sternal cleft, who did not have any problems in the early period, was admitted to our hospital with respiratory distress at the age of 43 days. The patient was monitored with mechanical ventilator support, and there were hemangiomas around his left ear and lips. There were paradoxical respiratory movements in front of the heart, in the upper midline of the chest. Three-dimensional computed tomography showed that the upper part of the sternum did not develop, and there were hypoplasic sternal bars on both sides. It was evaluated as superior partial sternal cleft, and surgery was planned. In the operation, the sternal bars were released from the pericardium and pleura. The periosteum in the medial of both sternal bars was then released and connected in the midline, in front of the pericardium. CONCLUSION: Although neonates with a sternal cleft are asymptomatic at birth, respiratory symptoms may develop in later periods. In addition, because the structures are more flexible in the neonatal period, the primary repair of the cleft is easier and the risk of cardiac compression is lower. In our case, sternal bars could be approached primary, and no chondral grafts, patches, or steel wires were required.","Tanriverdi, Halil Ibrahim; Doğaneroğlu, Fulya; Genç, Abdülkadir; Yılmaz, Ömer",Ann Pediatr Surg,393,26

This has led to a worsening of disorders, such as anxiety and depression. This study aims to understand the health benefits of an immersive garden experience to elderly nursing home residents with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairments. Virtual reality devices were used to provide immersive garden experiences for the residents who were unable to go outside. The heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) data of the participants of the participants were collected using biofeedback instruments, and changes in the low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) and the standard deviation of the NN interval (SDNN) values caused by immersive garden experiences were discussed. The results show that the immersive garden experiences were beneficial to these elderly residents. Within 6 min of completing the experiment, we found that the heart rates of participants had dropped slightly, while SDNN and HF values continued to rise. SDNN values before and after the experiment demonstrated a statistically significant improvement. Furthermore, participants expressed their satisfaction with the video intervention program. The results indicated that nursing homes can provide immersive landscape experiences to help increase HRV and SDNN of their elderly residents. This will not only help these residents recall beautiful memories of their past, but will also improve their quality of life.

Our aim was to evaluate the incidence, presentation and outcome of management of perforated GJA ulcer disease after laparoscopic RYGB. METHODS The database of all patients at the senior author's bariatric institutions was retrospectively reviewed. The results are presented as mean (range). RESULTS From April 2002 to April 2010, 1213 patients underwent laparoscopic RYGB, which included 1184 primary and 29 revision procedures. The operative mortality was .15%. Ten patients developed perforated GJA ulcers (.82%) at a mean of 13.5 (6-19) months. The patients who presented to bariatric surgeons (n = 5) were treated with laparoscopic closure and an omental patch, and those who presented to nonbariatric surgeons (n = 5) were treated with laparotomy. The morbidity and mortality rate was 30% and 10%, respectively, and the mean postoperative hospital stay for the survivors was 14 (5-44) days. CONCLUSION Perforated GJA ulcers can develop in 1 of 120 patients after laparoscopic RYGB and can be effectively managed by laparoscopic repair with an omental patch, if expertise is available.","Kalaiselvan, Ramya; Exarchos, Georgios; Hamza, Numan; Ammori, Basil J",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,393,23

This research agenda included mechanisms that are available within and outside the current regulations. The task force identified 6 areas where research is needed: (1) access to methadone in general medical and other outpatient settings; (2) the impact of methadone treatment setting on patient outcomes; (3) impact of treatment structure on outcomes in patients receiving methadone; (4) comparative effectiveness of different medications to treat OUD; (5) optimal educational and support structure for provision of methadone by medical providers; and (6) benefits and harms of expanded methadone access. In addition to outlining these research priorities, the task force identified important cross-cutting issues, including the impact of patient characteristics, treatment, and treatment system characteristics such as methadone formulation and dose, concurrent behavioral treatment, frequency of dispensing, urine or oral fluid testing, and methods of measuring clinical outcomes.

The aim of this study is to retrospectively investigate our single-center experience of laparoscopic repair (LR) for RIH. METHODS The case records of 69 patients with RIH who underwent LR in our institution between January 2002 and November 2011 were reviewed. The operative technique has been standardized and provides onlay placement of an ePTFE mesh fixed with titanium tacks. Patients' demographic data and comorbidities, intraoperative course, PO complications and recurrences at follow-up were systematically collected and analyzed. The influence of defect's size and obesity variables on clinical outcomes was also investigated. RESULTS The mean operative time was 147.6 ± 71.2 min and mean hospital stay was 5.8 ± 1.8 days. No conversion occurred while five intraoperative complications (7.2 %) were recorded: three bowel injuries treated by laparoscopic sutures, one omentum bleeding and one epigastric vessel lesion. PO mortality was null, while overall morbidity was 13 % (9 patients) with a prevalence of seroma lasting over 8 weeks in six patients (8.7 %). Along a mean follow-up of 41 months (range 6-119), recurrence rate was 5.7 % (4 patients). Univariate analysis for width of defects and BMI showed no significant influence on patients' outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Surgical treatment for RIH remains controversial because of lack in literature of specific studies on this topic. Morbid obesity and large defects have been often associated with technical difficulties and worse results. Our 10 years' experience with LR provided satisfactory results in terms of PO morbidity and recurrence rate, despite any kind of patient selection.","Ferrari, G; Bertoglio, C; Magistro, C; Girardi, V; Mazzola, M; Di Lernia, S; Pugliese, R",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,393,1

METHODS Influenza VE in children was estimated in the first influenza season (2019/20) overlapping with the COVID-19 epidemic by conducting a single-center, test-negative case-control (TNCC) study. Effects of prior influenza infection and vaccination in children were assessed for the 2019-2020 season. RESULTS Among 386 children, the adjusted VE was significant for influenza A/H1N1 (45.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-69.7) and influenza B (66.7%; 95% CI: 35.9-82.7). Among patients aged 0-6 years, the adjusted VE was significant for influenza A (total: A/H1N1+A/H3N2) (65.0%; 95% CI: 22.2-84.3), influenza A/H1N1 (64.8%; 95% CI: 16.9-85.1), and influenza B (87.4%; 95% CI: 50.5-96.8). No VE was observed in patients aged 7-15 years. Two vaccine doses tended to decrease the incidences of influenza A (total) and influenza A/H1N1 in patients aged 0-6 years. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of influenza B infection in patients, who had influenza during the previous season, were significantly low among all participants (0.29; 95% CI: 0.11-0.78) and patients aged 7-15 years (0.34; 95% CI: 0.12-0.94).

Sleep is a vital behavioral state of living beings and a modulator of immune function and responsiveness. Shiftworkers show increased risk for developing viral infections due to possible compromise of both innate and acquired immunity responses. Short sleep and sleep loss, common consequences of shiftwork, are associated with altered integrity of the immune system.

Recently, synovial-fluid-derived MSCs were reported to have multi-lineage differentiation potential and immunomodulatory features, which indicates that these cells can be used for tissue engineering and systemic treatments. This study presents a protocol for simple and non-invasive isolation of MSCs derived from the bone marrow and synovial fluid of minipigs to analyze cell surface markers for cell phenotyping and in vitro culturing. Using sexually mature six-month-old minipigs, bone marrow was extracted from the iliac crest bone using a bone marrow extractor, and the synovial fluid was aspirated from the femorotibial joint. Procedures for the collection of samples from both sources were non-invasive. The protocols for effective isolation of MSCs from harvested cell sources and for creating in vitro culture conditions to expand stable MSCs from minipigs and the application of systemic autologous treatments are provided. For cell phenotyping, the cell surface markers of both cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. In the results, the MSCs were isolated from the synovial fluid of the minipigs and showed that synovial-fluid-derived MSCs have a similar morphology and cell phenotype to bone-marrow-derived MSCs. Therefore, non-invasively obtained synovial fluid is a valuable source of MSCs.","Lee, Won-Jae; Park, Ji-Sung; Jang, Si-Jung; Lee, Seung-Chan; Lee, HyeonJeong; Lee, Jae-Hoon; Rho, Gyu-Jin; Lee, Sung-Lim",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,393,6

Aerosol drug delivery to the lungs is expected to be an interesting route of administration. However, due to the alterations of lung compliance caused by fibrosis, local delivery remains challenging. This work aimed to develop a practical, relevant and ethically less restricted ex vivo respiratory model of fibrotic lung for regional aerosol deposition studies. This model is composed of an Ear-Nose-Throat replica connected to a sealed enclosure containing an ex vivo porcine respiratory tract, which was modified to mimic the mechanical properties of fibrotic lung parenchyma - i.e. reduced compliance. Passive respiratory mechanics were measured. 81mKr scintigraphies were used to assess the homogeneity of gas-ventilation, while regional aerosol deposition was assessed with 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphies. We validated the procedure to induce modifications of lung parenchyma to obtain aimed variation of compliance. Compared to the healthy model, lung respiratory mechanics were modified to the same extent as IPF-suffering patients. 81mKr gas-ventilation and 99mTc-DTPA regional aerosol deposition showed results comparable to clinical studies, qualitatively. This ex vivo respiratory model could simulate lung fibrosis for aerosol regional deposition studies giving an interesting alternative to animal experiments, accelerating and facilitating preclinical studies before clinical trials.","Montigaud, Yoann; Périnel-Ragey, Sophie; Plantier, Laurent; Leclerc, Lara; Goy, Clémence; Clotagatide, Anthony; Prévôt, Nathalie; Pourchez, Jérémie",Scientific reports,393,24

Long RSH-type enzymes encompass an N-terminal domain (NTD) harboring the second messenger nucleotide (p)ppGpp hydrolase and synthetase activity and a stress-perceiving and regulatory C-terminal domain (CTD). CTD-mediated binding of Rel to stalled ribosomes boosts (p)ppGpp synthesis. However, how the opposing activities of the NTD are controlled in the absence of stress was poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate on the RSH-type protein Rel that the critical regulative elements reside within the TGS (ThrRS, GTPase, and SpoT) subdomain of the CTD, which associates to and represses the synthetase to concomitantly allow for activation of the hydrolase. Furthermore, we show that Rel forms homodimers, which appear to control the interaction with deacylated-tRNA, but not the enzymatic activity of Rel. Collectively, our study provides a detailed molecular view into the mechanism of stringent response repression in the absence of stress.","Pausch, Patrick; Abdelshahid, Maha; Steinchen, Wieland; Schäfer, Heinrich; Gratani, Fabio Lino; Freibert, Sven-Andreas; Wolz, Christiane; Turgay, Kürşad; Wilson, Daniel N; Bange, Gert",Cell reports,393,1

By reviewing and analyzing the literature, we analyzed the influence of temperature on sperm, the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the testes, and the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the male reproductive system. RESULTS SARS-CoV-2 enters the body through the ACE2 receptor. The high expression of ACE2 on the surface of spermatogonia and supporting cells in the testes, as well as the immune response caused by COVID-19, can lead to testicular spermatogenesis dysfunction and reduced sperm count.

Methods: Review of clinical examination, CT, PET, MRI imaging, and autoantibodies testing. Results: The patient presented subacute cerebellar syndrome and myoclonus several days after general infectious symptoms. The oropharyngeal swab test was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Brain MRI was normal. CSF testing showed normal cell counts, negative RT-qPCR and no oligoclonal banding. Brain 18F-FDG-PET showed diffuse cortical hypometabolism, associated with putaminal and cerebellum hypermetabolism, compatible with encephalitis, and especially cerebellitis. The immunological study revealed high titers of IgG autoantibodies in serum and CSF directed against the nuclei of Purkinje cells, striatal and hippocampal neurons. Search for neoplasia including whole-body 18F-FDG-PET and CT scans was negative. Treatment with steroids allowed a rapid improvement of symptoms.

Methods A total of 32 children confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 24 and February 12, 2020 from four provinces in western China were enrolled in this study and followed up until discharge and quarantine 14 days later. Results Eleven children (34%) were asymptomatic, among whom six children had normal computed tomographic (CT) scan images. Age and gender were not associated with clinical symptoms or the results of CT scan in children infected with SARS-CoV-2. The concentrations of white blood cells and neutrophils were higher in children with asymptomatic infection than in children with clinical symptoms or CT abnormalities. Patients who presented with CT abnormalities had lower D-dimer or lower total bilirubin than those who had normal CT scan but clinical symptoms. All children recovered and no one died or was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The mean duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 15.4 (SD =7.2) days and similar for both asymptomatic children and children with symptoms or CT abnormalities. We found a significant negative correlation between the lymphocyte count and the duration of positive nucleic acid test.

The aim of this study was to determine the capability of an inanimate laparoscopic appendectomy model to discriminate between different levels of surgical experience (construct validity). METHODS The performance of 3 groups with different levels of expertise in laparoscopic surgery--experts (Group A), intermediates (Group B), and novices (Group C)--was evaluated. The groups were instructed of the task to perform in the model using a video tutorial. Procedures were recorded in a digital format for later analysis using the Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS) score; procedure time was registered. The data were analyzed using the analysis of variance test. RESULTS Twelve subjects were evaluated, 4 in each group, using the GOALS score and time required to finish the task. Higher scores were observed in the expert group, followed by the intermediate and novice groups, with statistically significant difference. Regarding procedure time, a significant difference was also found between the groups, with the experts having the shorter time. The proposed model is able to discriminate among individuals with different levels of expertise, indicating that the abilities that the model evaluates are relevant in the surgeon's performance. CONCLUSIONS Construct validity for the inanimate full-task laparoscopic appendectomy training model was demonstrated.

RESULTS Viral pathogens were identified in 34 patients (37.7%), with a seasonal peak from April to May. The most frequently detected virus was influenza virus [type A (16 cases; 47%), type B (4 cases; 12%)] followed by parainfluenza virus [PIV1 (9 cases; 26%), PIV3 (3 cases; 15%)], and none had RSV.

Other than health-related issues, the global healthcare structure was deeply affected due to an alarming imbalance in the demand-supply chain of critical medical equipment such as ventilators, quarantine closets, oxygen valves, protective equipment, etc., that support patients’ life during their battle against COVD-19. The field of 3D printing, or now commonly known as additive manufacturing (AM) has benefitted extremely by capitalizing on the increasing demand for manufacturing medical equipment. As a result, a vast number of start-ups have mushroomed up that are experimenting with various novel materials, techniques, and applications to build 3D printed products in quick turnaround time. Through this paper, we would highlight the propitious application of 3D printing in the biomedical engineering area. The chapter begins by addressing the fundamentals of 3D printing technologies and materials that shall be used to illustrate their whole system environmental impacts in later sections. This is followed by discussion over prominent countless initiatives that are being taken by multiple R&D centers, academic institutes, and various other corporations for the implementation of new technologies and materials to combat this pandemic. Further, the need for novel materials and the use of agricultural waste as compostable biomaterials for a circular economy has been discussed in detail. Aside to this, among the multiple 3D printing processes, a major focus has been on material extrusion, powder bed fusion, and material jetting techniques that are used for the medical sector based on current medical requirement, i.e., automatic door handle openers, face shields/masks, quarantine closets, ventilators, valves, etc. In the end, the conclusion will prove to be a stepping-stone for future research in this direction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Sood, H.; Kaur, S.; Sharma, I.",Lecture Notes in Bioengineering,393,24

Creation of nanoscale membrane pores is central to exocytosis, trafficking and other processes fundamental to life that require breaching of secure plasma or organelle membranes, and is the basis for biotechnologies using drug delivery, delivery of genetic material for gene editing and antimicrobial peptides. A prevailing view from seminal electroporation and membrane rupture studies is that pore growth and bilayer rupture are controlled by macroscopically long-lived metastable defect states that precede fully developed pores. It was argued that defect nucleation becomes rate-limiting at high tensions, explaining the exponential tension-dependence of rupture times [E. Evans et al., Biophys. J. 85, 2342-2350 (2003)]. Here we measured membrane pore free energies and bilayer rupture using highly coarse-grained simulations that probe very long time scales. We find no evidence of metastable pore states. At lower tensions, small hydrophobic pores mature into large hydrophilic pores on the pathway to rupture, with classical tension dependence of rupture times. Above a critical tension membranes rupture directly from a small hydrophobic pore, and rupture times depend exponentially on tension. Thus, we recover the experimentally reported regimes, but the origin of the high tension exponential regime is unrelated to macroscopically long-lived pre-pore defects. It arises because hydrophilic pores cannot exist above a critical tension, leading to radically altered pore dynamics and rupture kinetics.","An, Dong; Thiyagarajan, Sathish; Antipov, Egor; Alcott, Brett; O’Shaughnessy, Ben",bioRxiv,393,1

In this context, it is necessary to identify and describe Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that provide opportunities for health education, promotion, and prevention aimed at the general population. The study is a systematic review of MOOCs on health education, health promotion, and prevention for the general population in a pandemic context. Methods: We developed a search for MOOC courses aimed at the general population on health education, health promotion, and prevention in different MOOC available platforms. We executed a descriptive analysis of the main characteristics of the selected MOOCs. Results: There were 117 MOOCs chosen on Health education, promotion, and prevention for the general population. Coursera (40.3%) was the platform that offered the highest quantity of MOOCs; more than half of MOOCs language was in English (52.9%). The median duration time in hours of the selected MOOCs was 11 (IR 6-15). The predominant themes were ""Health promotion"" (43%) and ""Food and nutrition"" (31%), and the origin was mainly from Europe (37.8%). Conclusions: MOOCs offerings in Health Education (HE) is diverse, predominantly in English, of European origin, and in health promotion issues. This study opens an opportunity to multiply initiatives in different territories, considering other languages and topics more akin to each territorial reality, allowing it to be a more equitable learning opportunity in times of pandemic and compulsory social isolation.","Dolores-Maldonado, G.; Canari-Casano, J.

Herein a green and high-yield route has been developed to recycle waste masks (WMs) into CNTs/Ni hybrids via catalytic carbonization. Our results exhibited that the yield of carbon was as high as 64.4 g/100 g WMs. Furthermore, the as-fabricated CNTs/Ni hybrids were applied for microwave absorption, which displayed superior performances, including a strong reflection loss of -56.3 dB and an absorption bandwidth of 4.3 GHz with absorber thickness of only 2.0 mm. The mechanism was mainly ascribed to the favorable synergistic effects of CNTs and Ni on conduction and magnetic losses, dipolar polarization, interfacial polarization and impedance matching. Thus, this work provides an environmentally friendly, scalable and cost-effective strategy for recycling waste masks into high-valuable carbon nanomaterials, and exploits their potential application for microwave absorption. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Yu, R.; Wen, X.; Liu, J.; Wang, Y.; Chen, X.; Wenelska, K.; Mijowska, E.; Tang, T.",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,393,1

Countries within these groups (biclusters) are all in the same phase but with a slightly different trajectory. An approach based on the Greedy Two-Way KMeans biclustering algorithm is proposed to analyze COVID-19 epidemiological data, which identifies subgroups of countries that show a similar epidemic trajectory patterns over a specific period of time. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that the biclustering approach has been applied to analyze COVID-19 data. In fact, these COVID-19 epidemiological data is not a real count because not all data can be tracked properly and other practical difficulties in collecting the data. Even in developed countries, it has huge practical problems. Therefore, if we can use the IoT-based COVID-19 monitoring system to detect the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak, we can identify the real situation in each country.

Through fieldwork and interviews to local key actors, the research aims to answer the following intertwined questions: how does migrant agency develop? How is the borderwork reinvented? How do different local groups and authorities act, react, and interact with migrant agency and borderwork? These questions are addressed, scrutinizing three steps of a migrants’ corridor towards Europe: firstly, the landings and their social fabrication around the piers;secondly, the hole and the confinement fences on the hotspot-island;thirdly, the forced return to sea on the quarantine ships. In this way, the article shows how the pandemic becomes a constituent moment in border policies, devices and procedures, opening up a reinforced space–time of migrants’ containment.

A severe cytokine storm and pulmonary pathology can cause respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is one of the major causes of mortality associated with ALI. In this study, we aimed to determine a novel neural component through cardiopulmonary spinal afferents that mediates lung pathology during ALI/ARDS. We ablated cardiopulmonary spinal afferents through either epidural T1-T4 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) application or intra-stellate ganglia delivery of a selective afferent neurotoxin, resiniferatoxin (RTX) in rats 3 days post bleomycin-induced lung injury. Our data showed that both epidural and intra-stellate ganglia injection of RTX significantly reduced plasma extravasation and reduced the level of lung pro-inflammatory cytokines providing proof of principle that cardiopulmonary spinal afferents are involved in lung pathology post ALI. Considering the translational potential of stellate ganglia delivery of RTX, we further examined the effects of stellate RTX on blood gas exchange and lung edema in the ALI rat model. Our data suggest that intra-stellate ganglia injection of RTX improved pO2 and blood acidosis 7 days post ALI. It also reduced wet lung weight in bleomycin treated rats, indicating a reduction in lung edema. Taken together, this study suggests that cardiopulmonary spinal afferents play a critical role in lung inflammation and edema post ALI. This study shows the translational potential for ganglionic administration of RTX in ARDS.","Hahka, Taija M.; Xia, Zhiqiu; Hong, Juan; Kitzerow, Oliver; Nahama, Alexis; Zucker, Irving H.; Wang, Hanjun",bioRxiv,393,16

In rotor-stator cavities, the centrifugal and Coriolis forces have a strong influence on the turbulence by producing a secondary flow in the meridian plane composed of two thin boundary layers along the disks separated by a non-viscous geostrophic core. Most numerical simulations have been performed using RANS and URANS modelling, and very few investigations have been performed using LES. This paper reports on quantitative comparisons of two high-order LES methods to predict a turbulent rotor-stator flow at the rotational Reynolds number Re=400000. The classical dynamic Smagorinsky model for the subgrid-scale stress (Germano et al., Phys Fluids A 3(7):1760-1765, 1991) is compared to a spectral vanishing viscosity technique (S\'everac&Serre, J Comp Phys 226(2):1234-1255, 2007). Numerical results include both instantaneous data and postprocessed statistics. The results show that both LES methods are able to accurately describe the unsteady flow structures and to satisfactorily predict mean velocities as well as Reynolds stress tensor components. A slight advantage is given to the spectral SVV approach in terms of accuracy and CPU cost. The strong improvements obtained in the present results with respect to RANS results confirm that LES is the appropriate level of modelling for flows in which fully turbulent and transition regimes are involved.","Viazzo, St'ephane; Poncet, S'ebastien; Serre, Eric; Randriamampianina, Anthony; Bontoux, Patrick",,393,33

In absence of specific treatment or vaccine, with no natural immunity, we are forced to rely on old public health measures like Quarantine, Social distancing and Isolation for prevention of spread among community. Although isolated incidents of epidemics have required isolation and quarantine in the past, no pandemic has required social distancing to a national and international scale before. Despite the obvious physical health and economic concerns of this situation, all the above measures bring forth challenges of emotional and psychological nature which can be especially severe in special populations like elderly, young children and adolescents, health care workers, persons with mental illness. Also, certain aspects like death, role of mass media, and ethics also arise during isolation and quarantine. With mass media playing a significant role in drumming up the perceived threat, people may resort to panic behaviours like hoarding essential day to day use items and masks and other medical supplies leading to shortage. Problem of fake news related to COVID 19 lead to Govt. of India launching of AAROGYA SETU app as well as websites to centralise all COVID 19 related information to people of India. Death in isolation deprives family members and friends of opportunity to grieve for near and dear ones lost due infection or due to natural causes. The requirement of isolation and quarantine during this distressing pandemic has paved way for recognising the importance and advantages of telemedicine as a whole which has led to various government bodies including the Government of India to draw primary guidelines for medical practitioners to follow and ensure ethical concerns are addressed.","Nagdive, A.; Behere, P.

Little is known about how these policies impact various groups in society. This paper explores the relationship between social distancing policies, traffic volumes and air quality and how they impact various socioeconomic groups. This study aims to understand how disparate communities respond to Stay-at-Home Orders and other social distancing policies to understand how human behavior in response to policy may play a part in the prevalence of COVID-19 positive cases. We collected data on traffic density, air quality, socio-economic status, and positive cases rates of COVID-19 for each zip code of Salt Lake County, Utah (USA) between February 17 and June 12, 2020. We studied the impact of social distancing policies across three periods of policy implementation. We found that wealthier and whiter zip codes experienced a greater reduction in traffic and air pollution during the Stay-at-Home period. However, air quality did not necessarily follow traffic volumes in every case due to the complexity of interactions between emissions and meteorology. We also found a strong relationship between lower socioeconomic status and positive COVID-19 rates. This study provides initial evidence for social distancing's effectiveness in limiting the spread of COVID-19, while providing insight into how socioeconomic status has compounded vulnerability during this crisis. Behavior restrictions disproportionately benefit whiter and wealthier communities both through protection from spread of COVID-19 and reduction in air pollution. Such findings may be further compounded by the impacts of air pollution, which likely exacerbate COVID-19 transmission and mortality rates. Policy makers need to consider adapting social distancing policies to maximize equity in health protection.","Mendoza, Daniel L.; Benney, Tabitha M.; Ganguli, Rajive; Pothina, Rambabu; Krick, Benjamin; Pirozzi, Cheryl S.; Crosman, Erik T.; Sciences, Yue Zhang Department of Atmospheric; Utah, University of; City, Salt Lake; USA, Utah; Planning, Department of CityMetropolitan; Science, Department of Political; Engineering, Department of Mining; Pulmonary, Division of; Medicine, Critical Care; Medicine, Department of Internal; Medicine, School of; Life, Department of; Earth,; Sciences, Environmental; University, West Texas AM; Canyon,; USA, Texas; Epidemiology, Division of",,393,1

Further, the demand for electrical power is increasing drastically, and therefore, the exploitation of renewable energy resources, particularly solar photovoltaic-based technology for power generation is invigorated. However, the large-scale penetration of solar photovoltaic is becoming a major challenge in terms of stability, reliability of power when integrated with the grid. Thus, it becomes important to develop a novel approach or strategy which is useful to improve power quality, reliability, and grid stability. Solar photovoltaic power forecasting is a key tool for this new era and becoming the main component for a smart grid environment.

This study is among the first to examine the perception, awareness, and ease of compliance of T21 among tobacco retailers through a two-wave survey conducted pre-T21 and post-T21. Design: Surveys were conducted among the states more than 6,000 registered retailers prior to the states T21 law going into effect and eight months later after T21 had been enacted. The pre-T21 and post-T21 survey instruments measured retailer awareness, support, and perceived ability to comply with T21, current tobacco practices, revenue from tobacco products, and challenges faced in compliance. 414 retailers completed the pre-T21 survey and 360 completed the post-T21 survey. The final survey data was weighted to reflect the geographic distributions of licensed tobacco retailers in Maryland. Results: There was no significant difference in retailer awareness, support and challenges comparing pre and post T21. One notable caveat is lack of consumer knowledge about T21, resulting in retailers being responsible for educating customers. Conclusions: The evaluation of T21 and impact to retailers is a valuable tool in determining the laws success and barriers to implementation. Results support the idea that T21 laws have had a minor impact on how retailers conduct their business. As a result of the communication and materials provided by the state, retailers largely understand the law and how to adhere to guidelines.","Walsh, C.; Charles, J. M.",,393,22

To address this translational gap, we developed a high-fidelity swine model of ARDS utilizing clinically-relevant lung injury exposures. Fourteen male swine were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and surgically instrumented for hemodynamic monitoring, blood, and tissue sampling. Animals were allocated to one of three groups: 1) Indirect lung injury only: animals were inoculated by direct injection of E. coli into the kidney parenchyma, provoking systemic inflammation and distributive shock physiology; 2) Direct lung injury only: animals received volutrauma, hyperoxia, and bronchoscope-delivered gastric particles; 3) Combined indirect and direct lung injury: animals were administered both above-described indirect and direct lung injury exposures. Animals were monitored for up to 12 hours, with serial collection of physiologic data, blood samples, and radiographic imaging. Lung tissue was acquired post-mortem for pathological examination. In contrast to indirect lung injury only and direct lung injury only groups, animals in the combined indirect and direct lung injury group exhibited all of the physiological, radiographic, and histopathologic hallmarks of human ARDS: impaired gas exchange (mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio 124.8 ± 63.8), diffuse bilateral opacities on chest radiographs, and extensive pathologic evidence of diffuse alveolar damage.

Lessons can be experienced in virtual realty (VR) or on a personal computer monitor (PC). We predicted participants would learn from lessons presented on both VR and PC devices (comparing pre-test/post-test scores), but that VR would be more effective for achieving both content-based learning outcomes (i.e test performance) and experience-based learning outcomes (i.e., reported enjoyment and ease of use).

In particular, this study focuses on the effects of risk perception and social influence. A panel web-survey was conducted targeting residents of the Kanto Region, including the Tokyo Metropolis. In addition to describing the observed patterns in behavioral change, the authors modeled behavioral changes of four key, non-work-related activities: (i) grocery shopping, (ii) other types of shopping, (iii) eating out, and (iv) leisure. For eating-out and leisure the distinction was made between going alone or in groups. Based on the observed distributions of these activities, regression models of going-out frequency were estimated for shopping, while for eating-out and leisure, which showed considerably smaller frequencies, a discrete choice approach was used. Findings showed that as a measure of social influence, the perception of degree of self-restriction of others was associated with small reductions in shopping frequencies, and moderate yet non-negligible increases in going-out self-restriction probability for eating-out and leisure activities. Risk perception, measured as COVID-19 dread, was also associated with higher probabilities of going-out self-restriction for eating-out and leisure. These findings suggest that in the context of non-binding requests, soft measures such as campaigns to promote a reduction of non-essential travel might be more effective if they (i) properly convey the severity of the threat posed by COVID-19 as well as its coping mechanisms, and (ii) appeal to the group, rather than the individual, emphasizing the behavior (or at least the perception of behavior) of others.","Parady, Giancarlos Taniguchi Ayako Takami kiyoshi",Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,393,1

Geodesign, a data augmented collaborative approach, offers potential benefits in the resilience planning process. To assess the role of technology tools in geodesign, this chapter reviews the application of various design and planning support system (PSS) tools in resilience planning-related studies. Results indicate that there are at least 40 supportive PSS tools. However, application of such PSS tools has reportedly been impacted by several usability issues. Using a geodesign case study, this chapter examines the usability of several lightweight and opensource tools for collaboration. User evaluation revealed that stakeholders could interact with those tools easily, thus overcoming a significant barrier to adoption of PSS into planning. Leveraging the potential of integrating PSS with geodesign, further research should consider the roles PSS can play in supporting both face-to-face and virtual collaboration, especially in a post COVID-19 world. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Debnath, R.; Pettit, C.; Leao, S.

The majority of p go on to develop antibodies (Ab) against viral proteins. However, it is not known how long these antibodies last nor whether cancer treatments could affect the duration of immune response. The prognosis and greater or lesser vulnerability of the oncological population are also unknown. Methods: This prospective, longitudinal, multicenter serological study in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 was carried out in 50 Spanish hospitals. Eligibility criteria was a diagnosis of any thoracic cancer. The first determinations were performed between April 21, 2020 and June 3, 2020, either for p in follow up or in active treatment. Between September 10, 2020, and November 20, 2020, the second antibody (Ab) determination was performed in all previously seropositive p. Clinical and treatment data were collected, as was their clinical situation at study end. Study objectives were to prospectively determine seroprevalence in unselected lung cancer p during the first wave of the pandemic;the natural history of these p;the persistence of immunity more than 4 months after first determination;protection or lack thereof against reinfection after this period, and the nature of such protection;and the influence of treatments on maintenance or loss of immunity. Results: Of 1,500 p studied, 128 were seropositive, representing an overall prevalence of 8.5% seropositivity [95% confidence interval [CI], 7.2%, 10.1%]. Seventy-five percent were in active cancer treatment. COVID-19 infection was suspected in 47.7% [95% CI, 38.8%, 56.6%]. A second determination was performed on average 4.5 months later [IQR: 4;5] and obtained for 104 of the initially seropositive p (81%). A second determination could not be obtained in 24 p, the majority due to death caused by disease progression (73%). In the second determination, IgG was not detected in 30.8% (32/104) of p. The severity of the infection, the need for hospitalization (p: 0.032) and the presence of symptoms at diagnosis (p: 0.02), including fever (p: 0.005) and nasal congestion (p: 0.005), were associated with persistence of immunity in the second determination. No variables or treatments received were associated with Ab loss. At time of last follow-up among those p for whom a second determination was performed, 89% (93 p) had completely recovered from the virus, with no lasting after effects. Only 1 of the 128 (0.78%) seropositive p had died from COVID-19. Conclusions: The prevalence of infection in lung cancer p is similar to that of the general population. Immunity against SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to be compromised by treatment, persisting beyond 4 months. Neither do mortality rates appear to be particularly high in this unselected population.","Provencio, M.; Rodriguez-Abreu, D.; Lorduy, A. C.; Serrano, G. M.; Granados, A. L.

This article aims to contribute to this fast-growing research programme by focusing on the degree to which Italian citizens perceive democratic institutions as effective in coping with crises like the COVID-19 emergency. We put forward a set of hypotheses whereby negative evaluations of the effectiveness of democracy can be associated with social proximity to the disease and with perceived health and economic threats. We also argued that political factors can interact with such threats. Moreover, we hypothesised that certain factors dealing with the concepts of social capital and civic culture can help inhibit negative opinions about the effectiveness of democracy. To test these hypotheses, we analysed public opinion data collected in Italy between April and July 2020 using a Rolling Cross-Section survey design. The data showed that evaluations of democracy became more negative with social proximity to the disease and with individual perceived vulnerability, understood in health and economic terms. Our findings also highlighted that certain social factors which ""underpin"" democracy moderated negative evaluations. Finally, political factors like ideology and government appraisal shaped the relationship between individual threats and evaluations of democracy.","Pedrazzani, A.; Maraffi, M.; Guglielmi, S.; Biolcati, F.; Chiesi, A.

However, a bottleneck remains the poor understanding of the parameters that correlate with endosomal escape vs. cytotoxicity. To address this problem, we compared the endosomal distribution of six LNP-mRNA formulations of diverse chemical composition and efficacy, similar to those employed in mRNA-based vaccines, in primary human adipocytes, fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Surprisingly, we found that total uptake is not a sufficient predictor of delivery and different LNP vary considerably in endosomal distributions. Prolonged uptake impaired endosomal acidification, a sign of cytotoxicity, and caused mRNA to accumulate in compartments defective in cargo transport and unproductive for delivery. In contrast, early endocytic/recycling compartments have the highest probability for mRNA escape. By super-resolution microscopy we could resolve single LNP-mRNA within sub-endosomal compartments and capture events of mRNA escape from endosomal recycling tubules. Our results change the view of the mechanisms of endosomal escape and define quantitative parameters to guide the development of mRNA formulations towards higher efficacy and lower cytotoxicity.","Paramasivam, Prasath; Franke, Christian; Stöter, Martin; Höijer, Andreas; Bartesaghi, Stefano; Sabirsh, Alan; Lindfors, Lennart; Arteta, Marianna Yanez; Dahlén, Anders; Bak, Annette; Andersson, Shalini; Kalaidzidis, Yannis; Bickle, Marc; Zerial, Marino",bioRxiv,393,1

Although independent preparedness is considered to play an important role in disturbance and emergency-related survival, little attention has been paid to the ways in which individuals conduct their preparations or the social aspects of these preparatory activities This article investigates the ways in which survivalists engage with uncertain futures by preparing. Survivalism is a cultural movement that anticipates and prepares for different kinds and scales of disasters and disturbances. The analysis seeks to clarify for what, how, and why Finnish survivalists prepare for. This study employs an experimental setup that combines two different types of media material;media representations about survivalists made by journalists, and online discussions written by survivalists themselves on a Finnish survivalist web forum page. The data was subjected to qualitative thematic text analysis. The factors that motivate preparedness vary from ordinary and personal inconveniences to general and global disaster scenarios, which co-exist despite their different scales. In practice, the survivalist approach continuously moves between speculative futures and the material present. The survivalist worldview balances between different, seemingly opposite poles: norm-criticality, self-sufficiency, privacy, and collectivism.","Parkkinen, Marjukka",Futures,393,1

Due to its rapid progression of neurological dysfunction, it is considered an oncologic emergency that demands prompt diagnosis and management. Most cases of MSCC occur from breast, lung, and prostate primaries. MSCC secondary to carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland is rare. Case presentation: We report a 32-year-old Filipino ex-smoker male complaining of two-week history of progressive paresis associated with urinary and bowel retention. He had a history of total unilateral neck dissection for CEPA of the parotid gland last year followed by systemic chemotherapy with CAP regimen (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, cisplatin 50 mg/m2) for four cycles. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, he lost to follow-up. On examination, physical examination revealed an 8 x 8 cm recurrent fungating mass at the right post-auricular area with extension to the buccal cavity. Motor strength was 0/5 for both lower extremities with associated hyporeflexia. Sensation to pain, temperature, and proprioception was noted to be absent at the level of the umbilicus and below. Contrast-enhanced chest and abdominopelvic CT scan revealed mixed lytic-sclerotic osseous foci at the thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies, multiple intramuscular soft tissue foci, as well as bilateral lung and pleural-based nodules. Whole body bone scan showed multiple bone metastases. Radiation therapy to the spine was given at a total of 30 cGy in 10 fractions. Intravenous dexamethasone and bone resorption therapy were given. Palliative chemotherapy (paclitaxel 200 mg/m2, carboplatin AUC 6 mg·min/mL) was subsequently started. Conclusion: Although relatively rare, MSCC should be taken into consideration when a patient with history of CEPA presents with paraplegia. Prompt diagnosis and management are particularly important in preventing permanent neurological damage.","Ando, M. M.",Annals of Oncology,393,1

The resulting fragments were blunt-end ligated to the modified phage display vector pComb3XSS. The reactions were electrotransformed into XL1-Blue and infected with VCSM13 helper phage. The SARS-CoV S protein-specific phage displayed antigen library was biopanned and screened against two anti-S mAbs, S-M1 and S-M2. The results showed that we successfully constructed the phage displayed antigen library with a size of 5.7 x 10(6). After three-rounds of biopanning, 14 positive phage clones for S-M1 and 15 for S-M2 were respectively identified. Sequence analyses revealed the possible epitopes of two mAbs. Therefore, the S protein-specific phage displayed antigen library provides a crucial platform for the epitope characterization of anti-S antibodies and it is highly valuable for development of SARS vaccines and diagnostics.","Wu, Rui-Ping; Meng, Jia-Zi; He, Yu-Xian",Bing du xue bao = Chinese journal of virology,393,1

The SARS Surveillance Project (SARS-SP) was established to rapidly implement multiregional SARS surveillance in emergency departments (EDs) by using existing Internet-based tools. OBJECTIVES The objectives of SARS-SP were to 1) disseminate and update SARS screening forms for ED triage, 2) establish surveillance for SARS syndrome elements by using Regional Emergency Medicine Internet (REMI), 3) expand surveillance to multiple regions, and 4) evaluate the usefulness of Internet tools for agile surveillance during a rapidly emerging global epidemic. METHODS SARS-SP developed, distributed, and updated an Internet-based triage form to identify patients for infection control and public health reporting. EDs then were invited to report visit frequencies with various SARS syndrome elements to local public health authorities by using the REMI Internet application (first in one metropolitan area, and later in four). After pilot-testing in one metropolitan area, the surveillance system was implemented in three others. RESULTS Active syndromic surveillance was established by health departments in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Denver, Colorado; Akron, Ohio; and Fort Worth, Texas.

Favipiravir is an antiviral previously indicated for influenza and Ebola, which has shown some promise in early trials for treatment of COVID-19. We aim to review existing favipiravir safety evidence, which is vital to informing the potential future use of favipiravir in COVID-19. Methods A search was conducted across EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by relevant grey-literature and ClinicalTrials.gov. All studies assessing the use of favipiravir in humans by 27 March 2020 were considered for inclusion. Further analysis of available safety data from phase 2 and 3 studies was undertaken. Data extracted were adverse events (AEs) grade 1-4, serious AEs and discontinuation for AEs. Specific AEs of interest highlighted in early-phase studies, including gastrointestinal AEs and hyperuricaemia, were also examined. Results Twenty-nine studies were identified as potential sources of evidence of the clinical safety of favipiravir. Six were phase 2 and 3 studies reporting relevant safety data for statistical comparison, representing a total of 4299 participants, an estimated 175 person-years-of-follow-up (PYFU). Comparator drugs were oseltamivir, umifenovir, lopinavir/ritonavir or placebo. Study follow-up was between 5 and 21 days. The proportions of grade 1-4 AEs on favipiravir was 28.2% vs 28.4% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. The proportion of discontinuations due to AEs on favipiravir was 1.1% vs 1.2% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. For serious AEs the proportion was 0.4% in both arms (P = n.s.). There were significantly fewer gastrointestinal AEs occurring on favipiravir vs comparators [8.7% vs 11.5%; P = 0.003]. Favipiravir showed significantly more uric acid elevations than comparators [5.8% vs 1.3%; P<0.0001]. Conclusions Favipiravir demonstrates a favourable safety profile regarding total and serious AEs. However, safety concerns remain: hyperuricaemia, teratogenicity and QTc prolongation have not yet been adequately studied. Favipiravir may be safe and tolerable in short-term use, but more evidence is needed to assess the longer-term effects of treatment. Given the limitations of the evidence and unresolved safety concerns, caution is warranted in the widespread use of favipiravir against pandemic COVID-19.","Pilkington, Victoria; Pepperrell, Toby; Hill, Andrew",Journal of virus eradication,393,5

METHODS During the period from 16 March to 23 April 2020, telephone consultations substituting face-to-face consultations in children and adolescents from 0 to 19 years of age were prospectively recorded. In subsequent telephone interviews, families were asked about their views on the telephone consultation. RESULTS During the observation period, the clinic had 499 scheduled face-to-face appointments and 112 (22.4%) substitute telephone consultations. A total of 103 families participated in a telephone interview representing 87 (84.5%) children with atopic diseases and 16 (15.5%) with other conditions. A total of 100 (97.0%) of the families agreed or strongly agreed that they felt good about being offered a substitute telephone consultation; 14 (13.6%) said that a telephone consultation was not the best option, whereas 89 (80.4%) would not have preferred a face-to-face consultation; 98 (95.1%) felt that the telephone consultation was useful to them.

Emphasis is placed on the legal and political science perspective and on the comparison of measures against traffic at the state border, against the free movement of persons and specifically against commuter workers (also known as cross-border commuters, or as pendlers in the Czech context), during both previously declared states of emergency in the Czech Republic. From a theoretical perspective, the paper summarizes information and data on cross-border commuters in Europe and the world. The research was performed by means of two qualitative case studies. In general, the legal measures at the Czech-German state border and the conditions of commuter workers during these states of emergency are compared. The research stage also included media searches (during both states of emergency) and analysis of relevant policy outputs. The results suggest that border closures and related measures and the inability to travel abroad were unconstitutional, which also damaged commuters. And this also resulted in the fact that during the second state of emergency, the commuters were, in effect, not subject to any measures from the Czech side. © The Author(s) 2021.","Novotný, L.","Scientific Papers of the University of Pardubice, Series D: Faculty of Economics and Administration",393,20

Recent evidence shows that most of these comorbidities associated with COVID-19 infection are associated with dysregulation of the host immune response. Vitamins C and D have been shown to regulate immune response by decreasing the proinflammatory cytokine release from immune cells and inducing proliferation of other immune cells to robustly fight infection.

Fomite transference is one of the routes of transmission that has been considered for this virus. However, the risks associated with contaminated surfaces of food packaging kept in refrigerators have not yet been adequately assessed. In this study, a surrogate virus, Alphacoronavirus 1, was used to investigate the persistence of coronavirus dried on a plastic carrier at 4 °C. Techniques of wet wiping, with or without disinfectant saturation, were employed to evaluate their effectiveness in the elimination of the virus. If not wiped, the loss of infectivity of the virus on plastic surfaces was, on average, 0.93 log10 (i.e. 83%) per day of storage at 4 °C. Wiping with water-saturated material reduced the initial virus titre on the plastic carrier by 2.4 log10 (99.6%); the same results were achieved through wiping with bactericidal wipes containing ethanol. Wipes saturated with a combination of disinfectant agents (didecyl-dimethyl-ammonium chloride, hydrogen peroxide) decreased the virus titre still more efficiently, by 3.8 log10 (99.98%) and also significantly prevented further transfer of the virus to a secondary surface through wiping. Thus SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential via contaminated plastic packaging and food may be efficiently eliminated by wet-wiping, especially when wipes saturated with specific disinfectants are used.","Malenovská, Hana",Food Environ Virol,393,20

In this review, we summarize the progressive development of various treatments and vaccines as they have emerged, a year after the outbreak of the pandemic. Initially for COVID-19, patients were recommended drugs with presumed antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects that were previously used to treat other diseases. Thereafter, therapeutic interventions were supplemented with promising approaches based on antibodies, peptides, and stem cells. However, licensed COVID-19 vaccines remain the most effective weapon in combating the pandemic. While there is an enormous effort to enhance the vaccination rate to increase the entire population immunity, the production and delivery of vaccines is becoming limited in several countries. In this regard, there are new challenges needing to be addressed by combining non-pharmacological intervention with effective therapies until vaccination is accessible to all.","Hudakova, Nikola Hricikova Simona Kulkarni Amod Bhide Mangesh Kontsekova Eva Cizkova Dasa",Pathogens,393,1

Methods: This was a mixed-methods study. Emergency physicians completed a weekly online survey. The primary outcome was physician burnout as measured by the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization items, from the Maslach Burnout Inventory. We captured data on work patterns, aerosolizing procedures, testing and diagnosis of COVID-19. Each week participants entered free text explaining their experiences and well-being. Results: There were 468 participants who worked in 143 Canadian hospitals. Burnout levels did not significantly change over time (emotional exhaustion P = 0.632, depersonalization P = 0.155). Three participants were diagnosed with COVID-19. Being tested for COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 11.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.1-42.5) and the number of shifts worked (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5 per additional shift) were associated with high emotional exhaustion. Having been tested for COVID-19 (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.1-17.8) was also associated with high depersonalization. Personal safety, academic and educational work, personal protective equipment, the workforce, patient volumes, work patterns, and work environment had an impact on physician well-being. A new financial reality and contrasting negative and positive experiences affected participants' psychological health.

However, there are limited data on efficacy and associated adverse events. Objective: To describe the association between use of hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, and clinical outcomes among hospital inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective multicenter cohort study of patients from a random sample of all admitted patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in 25 hospitals, representing 88.2% of patients with COVID-19 in the New York metropolitan region. Eligible patients were admitted for at least 24 hours between March 15 and 28, 2020. Medications, preexisting conditions, clinical measures on admission, outcomes, and adverse events were abstracted from medical records. The date of final follow-up was April 24, 2020. Exposures: Receipt of both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, or neither. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were cardiac arrest and abnormal electrocardiogram findings (arrhythmia or QT prolongation). Results: Among 1438 hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (858 [59.7%] male, median age, 63 years), those receiving hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both were more likely than those not receiving either drug to have diabetes, respiratory rate >22/min, abnormal chest imaging findings, O2 saturation lower than 90%, and aspartate aminotransferase greater than 40 U/L.

Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York with COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both, compared with neither treatment, was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality. However, the interpretation of these findings may be limited by the observational design.","Rosenberg, Eli S; Dufort, Elizabeth M; Udo, Tomoko; Wilberschied, Larissa A; Kumar, Jessica; Tesoriero, James; Weinberg, Patti; Kirkwood, James; Muse, Alison; DeHovitz, Jack; Blog, Debra S; Hutton, Brad; Holtgrave, David R; Zucker, Howard A",JAMA,393,20

METHODS: PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who underwent both LUS and chest CT at the Emergency Department were retrospectively analysed. In both modalities, twelve peripheral lung zones were identified and given a Severity Score basing on main lesion pattern. On CT scans the well-aerated lung volume (%WALV) was visually estimated. Per-patient and per-zone assessments of LUS classification performance taking CT findings as reference were performed, further revisioning the images in case of discordant results. Correlations between number of disease-positive lung zones, Severity Score and %WALV on both LUS and CT were assessed. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to determine LUS performance in detecting %WALVâ¯&#8804;â¯70 %. RESULTS: The study included 219 COVID-19 patients with abnormal chest CT. LUS correctly identified as positive 217 (99 %) patients, but per-zone analysis showed sensitivityâ¯=â¯75 % and specificityâ¯=â¯66 %. The revision of the 121 (55 %) cases with positive LUS and negative CT revealed COVID-compatible lesions in 42 (38 %) CT scans. Number of disease-positive zones, Severity Score and %WALV between LUS and CT showed moderate correlations. The AUCs for LUS Severity Score and number of LUS-positive zones did not differ in detecting %WALVâ¯&#8804;â¯70 %. CONCLUSION: LUS in COVID-19 is valuable for case identification but shows only moderate correlation with CT findings as for lesion patterns and severity quantification. The number of disease-positive lung zones in LUS alone was sufficient to discriminate relevant disease burden.","Rizzetto, Francesco; Perillo, Noemi; Artioli, Diana; Travaglini, Francesca; Cuccia, Alessandra; Zannoni, Stefania; Tombini, Valeria; Di Domenico, Sandro Luigi; Albertini, Valentina; Bergamaschi, Marta; Cazzaniga, Michela; De Mattia, Cristina; Torresin, Alberto; Vanzulli, Angelo",Eur J Radiol,393,32

Methods: We created and administered a 17-item questionnaire for health care professionals (HCPs) to assess their level of knowledge towards this ongoing and evolving pandemic. It was disseminated through Web- and mobile-based social networks. The questions were sourced and created from various standard national and international guidelines available at the time of writing. Results: A total of 827 medical personnel participated in the study. Among them, 65.5% scored between 60% and 79%, indicating a moderate level of knowledge. There was no statistically significant difference in the scores of doctors, nursing officers and dental surgeons (p = 0.200). Participants had good knowledge regarding clinical symptoms, mode of transmission and preventive measures. But the study identified some gaps in knowledge in the implementation of management protocols, handling of dead bodies and biomedical waste management of COVID-19 cases.

METHODOLOGY: The device consists of a rigid translucent acrylic structure (methyl polymethacrylate), adjusted to the dental chair, involving the patient's head, neck and chest. There is also a piping system to generate negative pressure, for aspiration and filtering of the air inside the device chamber. The operator works through small holes in the acrylic structure, to reduce contact with the microparticles arising from aerosols during dental procedures. Simulated dental procedures using a fluorescent dye in the water of the dental equipment were carried out, with and without the use of the device. The presence of the dye was analysed at various locations, such as on personal protective equipment (PPE), the dental chair and on the clinic floor. RESULTS: In the simulated dental procedure without the device, the dye was obvious on surgical gloves, aprons (waist, chest, legs, fists) and face shields, as well as on the dental chair (backrest, light reflector) and clinic floor. In the simulated dental procedure using the device, the dye was observed only on surgical gloves, apron (fists), inside the pipe system and internal walls of the acrylic chamber. There was a certain limitation of movement and visualization by the dentist whilst using the device. CONCLUSIONS: The present device is a low-cost complementary resource for use in conjunction with standard PPE, to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the dental setting. Further clinical trials should be carried out to test the efficacy of this device to reduce aerosol dispersion and the consequent vector of contamination, as well as the ergonomic impacts related to its use.","Teichert-Filho, R; Baldasso, C N; Campos, M M; Gomes, M S",Int. endod. j,393,6

Recommendations for ""social distancing"" and the fear of patients becoming infected during a visit to a medical facility have led to a drastic decrease in personal doctor-patient contacts. This affects both acute care and treatment of the chronically ill. The immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection is so far only insufficiently understood and could be altered in a favorable or unfavorable way by therapy with monoclonal antibodies. There is currently no evidence for an increased risk of a severe COVID-19 course in allergic patients. Many patients are under ongoing therapy with biologicals that inhibit type 2 immune responses via various mechanisms. There is uncertainty about possible immunological interactions and potential risks of these biologicals in the case of an infection with SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A selective literature search was carried out in PubMed, Livivo, and the internet to cover the past 10 years (May 2010 - April 2020). Additionally, the current German-language publications were analyzed. Based on these data, the present position paper provides recommendations for the biological treatment of patients with allergic and atopy-associated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In order to maintain in-office consultation services, a safe treatment environment must be created that is adapted to the pandemic situation. To date, there is a lack of reliable study data on the care for patients with complex respiratory, atopic, and allergic diseases in times of an imminent infection risk from SARS-CoV-2. Type-2-dominant immune reactions, as they are frequently seen in allergic patients, could influence various phases of COVID-19, e.g., by slowing down the immune reactions. Theoretically, this could have an unfavorable effect in the early phase of a SARS-Cov-2 infection, but also a positive effect during a cytokine storm in the later phase of severe courses. However, since there is currently no evidence for this, all data from patients treated with a biological directed against type 2 immune reactions who develop COVID-19 should be collected in registries, and their disease courses documented in order to be able to provide experience-based instructions in the future. CONCLUSION: The use of biologicals for the treatment of bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and spontaneous urticaria should be continued as usual in patients without suspected infection or proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. If available, it is recommended to prefer a formulation for self-application and to offer telemedical monitoring. Treatment should aim at the best possible control of difficult-to-control allergic and atopic diseases using adequate rescue and add-on therapy and should avoid the need for systemic glucocorticosteroids. If SARS-CoV-2 infection is proven or reasonably suspected, the therapy should be determined by weighing the benefits and risks individually for the patient in question, and the patient should be involved in the decision-making. It should be kept in mind that the potential effects of biologicals on the immune response in COVID-19 are currently not known. Telemedical offers are particularly desirable for the acute consultation needs of suitable patients.","Klimek, Ludger; Pfaar, Oliver; Worm, Margitta; Eiwegger, Thomas; Hagemann, Jan; Ollert, Markus; Untersmayr, Eva; Hoffmann-Sommergruber, Karin; Vultaggio, Alessandra; Agache, Ioana; Bavbek, Sevim; Bossios, Apostolos; Casper, Ingrid; Chan, Susan; Chatzipetrou, Alexia; Vogelberg, Christian; Firinu, Davide; Kauppi, Paula; Kolios, Antonios; Kothari, Akash; Matucci, Andrea; Palomares, Oscar; Szépfalusi, Zsolt; Pohl, Wolfgang; Hötzenecker, Wolfram; Rosenkranz, Alexander R; Bergmann, Karl-Christian; Bieber, Thomas; Buhl, Roland; Buters, Jeroen; Darsow, Ulf; Keil, Thomas; Kleine-Tebbe, Jörg; Lau, Susanne; Maurer, Marcus; Merk, Hans; Mösges, Ralph; Saloga, Joachim; Staubach, Petra; Jappe, Uta; Rabe, Klaus F; Rabe, Uta; Vogelmeier, Claus; Biedermann, Tilo; Jung, Kirsten; Schlenter, Wolfgang; Ring, Johannes; Chaker, Adam; Wehrmann, Wolfgang; Becker, Sven",Allergol Select,393,21

Due to the nature of the pandemic and the heightened focus on contamination, cleaning, and social distancing, it is likely that a deterioration of OCD symptoms and severity will be seen. AIMS: Our aims were to evaluate (1) self-reported changes in OCD symptom severity of adults with OCD during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, (2) whether the COVID-19 pandemic would trigger self-reported contamination symptoms in persons with no history of such symptoms, (3) self-reported variables associated with OCD symptom severity change, and 4) self-reported changes in quality of life. METHOD: A 47-item self-report questionnaire was sent to all members of the Danish OCD Association and the final sample comprised 201 adult participants. The association of OCD severity change with demographic and clinical variables was analyzed using linear regression. RESULTS: 61.2% of participants reported an increase in OCD severity, based on the retrospective self-report. Female gender, self-reported contamination symptoms, and self-reported psychiatric comorbidity were found to have a significant association with increasing OCD severity. Five participants reported the emergence of contamination symptoms and two of harm related symptoms. Thirty participants reported a severe reduction in quality of life (&gt;=80). CONCLUSIONS: A large group of people suffering from OCD may require special attention and care during a pandemic like COVID-19 in order to lessen the deterioration of OCD symptoms and also to minimize the reduction in quality of life evident in this group.","Hojgaard, Drma Duholm C.; Nissen, J.

The treatment for the severe respiratory illness caused by this virus is primarily symptomatic at this point, although the usage of a broad antiviral drug Remdesivir has been allowed on emergency basis by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The ever-increasing death toll highlights an urgent need for development of specific antivirals. In this work, we have utilized docking and simulation methods to identify small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Membrane (M) and Envelope (E) proteins, which are essential for virus assembly and budding. A total of 70 compounds from an Indian medicinal plant source (Azadirachta indica or Neem) were virtually screened against these two proteins and further analyzed with molecular dynamics simulations, which resulted in the identification of a few common compounds with strong binding to both structural proteins. The compounds bind to biologically critical regions of M and E, indicating their potential to inhibit the functionality of these components. We hope that our computational approach may result in the identification of effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 assembly.","Borkotoky, Subhomoi; Banerjee, Manidipa",J Biomol Struct Dyn,393,20

New York City administration enacted a strict isolation decision at the end of March 2020 to tackle the COVID-19, creating a unique opportunity to assess air quality. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the lockdown on air quality in New York City. We evaluated the air pollutants concentration, i.e., PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2, and O3, during the lockdown and compared them with pre-COVID-19. We explored the first phase of lockdown through a spatial approach, then formulated the air quality index (AQI) of each pollutant before and during the lockdown. Our findings revealed that (1) there was a significant decline in the concentration level of PM2.5 from 10.3 to 4.0 µg/m3 during phase one of lockdown. (2) NO2 concentrations have been decreased by up to 52% in 1st phase of lockdown. (3) O3 concentration has been increased by 44.4%. (4) Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island County encountered 18.75%, 55.62%, 47.14%, and 47% diminution in AQI due to lockdown as compared to 2018, respectively.

Nanoparticles encapsulating an antibiotic drug, ofloxacin, were fabricated using emulsion solvent evaporation technique adopting 23 full factorial design to evaluate the effect of formulation parameters: that is to say, the molecular weight of the polymer (polycaprolactone), amount of Kolliphor P188, and presence of the charge inducer (chitosan hydrochloride) on the measured responses: drug entrapment efficiency (EE%), particle size (PS), polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential (ZP). The results show that the optimized LPCL-NP2 formulation (composed of low molecular weight polycaprolactone, 500 mg of Kolliphor P188, 0.25% chitosan hydrochloride, and 50 mg ofloxacin) displayed a sphere shape with EE%, PS, PDI, and ZP values of 89.73 ± 0.04%, 195.4 ± 13.17 nm, 0.323 ± 0.01, and 55.4 ± 0.66 mV, respectively. DSC study confirmed the amorphous nature of the drug. The optimized nanoparticle formulation was then further incorporated into the following two ocular formulations: gel (LPCL-NP2-G4) and in situ forming gel (LPCL-NP2-ISG4). The penetration of optimized ocular formulations was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The antimicrobial study was conducted for the following three ocular formulations: LPCL-NP2 presented as eye drops, LPCL-NP2-G4, and LPCL-NP2-ISG4 as well as the market product using rabbits which were infected in their eyes with Escherichia coli. Results revealed that rabbits treated with LPCL-NP2-ISG4 demonstrated a remarkable antibacterial efficacy and evident low bacterial growth which was additionally assured by the histopathological examination of eye biopsies compared with the other investigated groups.

Smell impairment affects physical and mental health, and dietary behavior. Thus, it is critical to understand the rate and time course of smell recovery. Objective: To characterize smell function and recovery up to 11 months post COVID-19 infection. Settings, Participants: This longitudinal survey of individuals suffering COVID-19-related smell loss assessed disease symptoms and gustatory and olfactory function. Participants (n=12,313) who completed an initial respiratory symptoms, chemosensory function, and COVID-19 diagnosis survey (S1) between April and September 2020 and completed a follow-up survey (S2) between September 2020 and February 2021; 27.5% participants responded (n=3,386), with 1,468 being diagnosed with COVID-19 and suffering co-occurring smell and taste loss at the beginning of their illness. Main Outcomes & Measures: Primary outcomes are ratings of smell and taste function on a visual analog scale, and self-report of parosmia (smell distortions) and phantosmia (unexplained smells). Secondary outcomes include a checklist of other COVID-19 symptoms. Results: On follow-up (median time since COVID-19 onset ~200 days), ~60% of women and ~48% of men reported less than 80% of their pre-illness smell ability. Taste typically recovered faster than smell, and taste loss rarely persisted if smell recovered. Prevalence of parosmia and phantosmia was ~10% of participants in S1 and increased substantially in S2: ~47% for parosmia and ~25% for phantosmia. Persistent smell impairment was associated with more symptoms overall, suggesting it may be a key marker of long-COVID. During COVID-19 illness, the ability to smell was slightly lower among those who did not recover their pre-illness ability to smell at S2. Conclusions and Relevance: While smell loss improves for many individuals who lost it due to COVID-19, the prevalence of parosmia and phantosmia increases substantially over time. Olfactory dysfunction is also associated with wider COVID-19 symptoms and may persist for many months after COVID-19 onset. Taste loss in the absence of smell loss is rare. Persistent qualitative smell symptoms are emerging as common long-term sequelae; more research into treatment options is strongly warranted given that conservative estimates suggest millions of individuals may experience parosmia following COVID-19.

The computer-aided diagnosis with deep learning methods can perform automatic detection of COVID-19 using CT scans. However, large scale annotation of CT scans is impossible because of limited time and heavy burden on the healthcare system. To meet the challenge, we propose a weakly-supervised deep active learning framework called COVID-AL to diagnose COVID-19 with CT scans and patient-level labels. The COVID-AL consists of the lung region segmentation with a 2D U-Net and the diagnosis of COVID-19 with a novel hybrid active learning strategy, which simultaneously considers sample diversity and predicted loss. With a tailor-designed 3D residual network, the proposed COVID-AL can diagnose COVID-19 efficiently and it is validated on a large CT scan dataset collected from the CC-CCII. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed COVID-AL outperforms the state-of-the-art active learning approaches in the diagnosis of COVID-19. With only 30% of the labeled data, the COVID-AL achieves over 95% accuracy of the deep learning method using the whole dataset.

In the present study, it was attempted to investigate the conservative pollution transport at channel confluence by operating a series of experiments in the laboratory flume. In the designed laboratory model, two branches, with different widths of 45, 25 cm, were intersected and a channel confluence was created. Five entrance discharges and three initial contaminant concentrations, introduced using a linear feeder, were chosen as experimental variables. Conservative tracer of sodium chloride solution was used, and the electrical conductivities were measured at eight locations of the main channel and upstream branches with 2 seconds interval. Junction zone was assumed as a control volume, and by applying mass equilibrium to it, a new mathematical model was extracted. It was observed that there is concentration fluctuation in the falling limbs of the experimental breakthrough curves of the junction zone; however, it was diminished by downstream motion. Moreover, the observed pollution graphs had double peak points which changed to a single point with an increase of distance from the confluence position. Operation of the presented model was investigated by variation of its parameters. It was found that the contaminant residence time parameters of the confluence zone have the most significant influence in the simulation of the analytical model. Additionally, it was observed that the values of Gaussian distribution of the upstream branches could displace the position of pulses of resultant breakthrough curves or can overlap them. Moreover, the model performance was examined using statistical goodness of fit parameters like Nash-Sutcliffe, R2, and mean absolute error (MAE). Their values were calculated as 0.88, 0.91, 66.88 (ppm), respectively.","Chabokpour, Jafar; Azamathulla, Hazi Md; Azhdan, Yaghoub; Ziaei, Milad",Water Sci Technol,393,1

Pulmonary CT revealed bilateral multiple consolidation with bilateral pleural effusion. Aggressive weight reduction was needed to improve the patient's respiratory condition. Hemodialysis therapy was performed in isolation with hydroxychloroquine administration, but the formation of a dialysis membrane clot forced the withdrawal of dialysis therapy. Changing the dialysis membrane material and anticoagulant enabled the resumption of dialysis therapy, allowing the body weight to correct downward. On the 5th hospitalization day, the patient's fever dropped and he showed improved oxygenation and chest X-ray. He was eventually discharged. The hydroxychloroquine and appropriate fluid management may have contributed to the patient's recovery.

This study evaluated several mental health and well-being indicators in a large sample from the United Kingdom (UK) during the COVID-19 lockdown where the death rate is currently the highest in Europe. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey with a study sample that mirrors general population norms according to sex, age, education, and region was launched four weeks after lockdown measures were implemented in the UK. Measures included mental health-related quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF psychological domain), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), perceived stress (PSS-10), and insomnia (ISI). ANOVAs, Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests, and t-tests were applied to examine mental health indicators across different sociodemographic groups (age, sex, employment, income, physical activity, relationship status). RESULTS: The sample comprised N=1,006 respondents (54% women) from all regions of the UK. Approximately 52% of respondents screened positive for a common mental disorder, and 28% screened positive for clinical insomnia. Mean scores and standard deviations were as follows: PHQ-9: M=9.0±7.7; GAD-7: M=8.0±6.5; ISI: M=10.4±7.0; PSS-10: M=17.7±7.9; WHO-QOL BREF: M=58.6±21.4; WHO-5 score M=13.0±6.0. Statistical analyses consistently indicated more severe mental health problems in adults under 35 years, women, people with no work, and low income (all p-values <.05). Mental health indices also varied across UK regions. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depressive-, anxiety-, and insomnia symptoms is significantly higher in the UK, relative to pre-pandemic epidemiological data. Further studies are needed to clarify the causes for these high rates of mental health symptoms.","Pieh, Christoph; Budimir, Sanja; Delgadillo, Jaime; Barkham, Michael; Fontaine, Johnny R J; Probst, Thomas",Psychosom. med,393,20

Case report: A 51-year-old Asian woman visited the emergency care department during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Northern Italy. About 6 months before, she had noted the onset of right breast swelling accompanied by skin redness and itching. She never consulted a physician, and, over time, the local skin condition progressed to a large scaly plaque covering the entire breast surface including the nipple. At presentation, abduction of the right upper limb was impaired due to severe shoulder pain. CT scan showed the presence of bilateral breast masses with necrotic and colliquative features, and multiple skeletal, nodal, pulmonary, and brain images suggestive of metastases. An ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the contralateral breast showed grade 2 non-special type infiltrating carcinoma.

Evidence from the Emergency Phase in Italy,10.802171,11.008888,2020,"Current societies are based on huge flows of information and knowledge circulating on the Internet, created not only by traditional means but by all kinds of users becoming producers, which leads to fake news and misinformation. This situation has been exacerbated by the pandemic to an unprecedented extent through social media, with special concern among young people. This study aims to provide significant data about the youngest generation in Spain (Generation Z) regarding their media and information consumption, their social network use, and their relationship with fake news, all in relation to the feeling of reliability/trust. Focusing on a convenience sample of 408 young Spanish students from Generation Z aged 18 to 22, a descriptive exploratory study is presented. Data collection was performed with an adapted questionnaire. Results show that young Spanish people use networks for information, showing a surprising lack of trust in social networks as the media they consume the most. The content they consume the most since the occurrence of COVID-19 is related to politics, entertainment, humor, and music. On the other hand, distrust of politicians, media, and journalists is evident. The conclusion is that media literacy is still more necessary than ever, but with the added challenge of mistrust: maybe it is time to rethink media literacy. © 2021 by the authors.

The nucleocapsid (N) proteins of CoVs are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, where the viruses replicate, but in some cases the proteins are partially located in the nucleolus. Many studies have investigated the subcellular localization and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signals of the CoV N proteins, but little is known about ToV N proteins. Here, we studied the subcellular localization of the bovine ToV (BToV) N protein (BToN) and characterized its nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signals. Unlike other CoVs, BToN in infected cells was transported mainly to the nucleolus during early infection but was distributed predominantly in the nucleoplasm rather than in the nucleolus during late infection. Interestingly, a small quantity of BToN was detected in the cytoplasm during infection. Examination of a comprehensive set of substitution or deletion mutants of BToN fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) revealed that clusters of arginine (R) residues comprise nuclear/nucleolar localization signals (NLS/NoLS), and the C-terminal region served as a chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1)-independent nuclear export signal (NES). Moreover, recombinant viruses with mutations in the NLS/NoLS, but retaining nuclear accumulation, were successfully rescued and showed slightly reduced growth ability, while the virus that lost the NLS/NoLS-mediated nuclear accumulation of BToN was not rescued. These results indicate that BToN uniquely accumulates mainly in nuclear compartments during infection, regulated by an R-rich NLS/NoLS and a CRM1-independent NES, and that the BToN accumulation in the nuclear compartment driven by NLS/NoLS is important for virus growth.IMPORTANCE ToVs are diarrhea-causing pathogens detected in many species, including humans. BToV has spread worldwide, leading to economic loss, and there is currently no treatment or vaccine available. Positive-stranded RNA viruses, including ToVs, replicate in the cytoplasm, and their structural proteins generally accumulate in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, BToN accumulated predominantly in the nucleus/nucleolus during all infectious processes, with only a small fraction accumulating in the cytoplasm despite being a major structural protein. Furthermore, we identified unique nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signals and demonstrated the importance of NLS/NoLS for virus growth. This study is the first to undertake an in-depth investigation of the subcellular localization and intracellular trafficking signals of BToN. Our findings additionally suggest that the NLS/NoLS-mediated nuclear accumulation of BToN is important for virus replication. An understanding of the unique features of BToV may provide novel insights into the assembly mechanisms of not only ToVs but also other positive-stranded RNA viruses.","Ujike, Makoto; Kawachi, Yukako; Matsunaga, Yui; Etho, Yuka; Asanuma, Hideki; Kamitani, Wataru; Taguchi, Fumihiro",J. virol,393,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven subjects with ACL tears (32 females; age 32.6 ± 8.3 years; BMI 24.5 ± 3.5 kg/m2) from a prospective study were screened for the presence of MRLs. Morphological (high-resolution 3D fast spin-echo) and compositional (T1&#961; and T2 mapping) MRI was performed prior to and 2 years after ACL reconstruction. Follow-up MR images were assessed for changes in the signal intensity of the MRLs and the presence of meniscal tears. Differences of compositional parameters were compared between subjects with MRLs and without meniscal lesions using independent samples t tests. RESULTS: MRLs were found in 16% (9/56) of the subjects with ACL tears at baseline. Only one subject with MRLs developed a posterior horn meniscal tear over 2 years. In 12 knees, no meniscal tears were found, which were defined as controls. Most interestingly, cartilage &#8710;T1&#961; of the medial femur and medial tibia increased significantly more in subjects with MRLs compared with controls (mean difference, MF = 6.0 ± 0.8 vs. 2.3 ± 0.6, p = 0.004, and MT = 4.4 ± 1.4 vs. 0.4 ± 0.6, p = 0.027) and medial femur &#8710;T2 over 2 years increased significantly more in MRL than in control knees (5.1 ± 2.5 ms vs. 2.2 ± 1.9 ms, p = 0.012).

Despite its importance in pig industries and zoonotic potential, little is known about the effects of this pathogen. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the molecular characteristics and antimicrobial resistance of SDSE strains isolated from diseased pigs. METHODS: A total 11 SDSE isolates were obtained from diseased pigs. Bacterial identification, PCR for virulence genes, emm typing, and antimicrobial resistance genes, multilocus sequence typing, and antimicrobial susceptibility test were performed. RESULTS: Nine isolates were from piglets, and 8 showed lameness, sudden death, or neurological signs. The isolates were PCR-positive for sla (100%), sagA (100%), and scpA (45.5%), and only 1 isolate amplified the emm gene (stL2764). Eight different sequence types were detected, categorized into 2 clonal complexes and 4 singletons. All the isolates in this study were included in a small cluster, which also contained other strains derived from humans and horses. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for the tested beta-lactams were low, while those for macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones were relatively high. PCR analysis of the macrolide and tetracycline resistance genes demonstrated that the isolates carried erm(B) (18.2%, n = 2), mef(A/E) (9.1%, n = 1), tet(M) (18.2%, n = 2), and tet(O) (90.2%, n = 10). Two isolates presented a mutation in parC, which is associated with fluoroquinolone resistance. CONCLUSION: This study provided insight into swine-derived SDSE, as it is related to veterinary medicine, and elucidated its zoonotic potential, in the context of molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance in public health.","Oh, Sang Ik; Kim, Jong Wan; Kim, Jongho; So, Byungjae; Kim, Bumseok; Kim, Ha Young",J Vet Sci,393,1

Studies using the rubber- or virtual-hand illusion have assessed ownership and agency by means of explicit ownership and agency ratings and implicit measures, like proprioceptive drift in the case of ownership. These measures often show similar effects but also some discrepancies, suggesting that they rely on data sources that overlap, but not completely. To systematically assess commonalities and discrepancies, we adopted an immersed virtual hand illusion (VHI) design, in which three independent factors were manipulated: the synchrony between the movement of real and virtual effector, the type of effector, which was a virtual hand or triangle, and the spatial congruency between the real and virtual effector. Commonalities and discrepancies in the effects of these factors were assessed by crossing explicit and implicit measures for ownership and agency. While standard ratings were used as explicit measures, implicit ownership was assessed by means of proprioceptive drift and implicit agency by means of intentional binding. Results showed similar effect patterns for the two agency measures, which, however, were not correlated, different effect patterns for the two ownership measures, and a strong correlation between the two explicit measures. Taken altogether, our findings suggest that explicit and implicit measures of ownership and agency partly rely on shared informational sources, but seem to differ with respect to other sources that are integrated or with respect to the processed dimension (shape vs. time). The findings also suggest that some findings obtained with RHI designs might reflect more the unnatural situation that that design puts individuals into rather than generalizable mechanisms of computing perceived ownership and agency.","Ma, Ke; Qu, Jue; Yang, Liping; Zhao, Wenwen; Hommel, Bernhard",Exp. brain res,393,24

Next to the established classes of favorable and against, we add mixed and neutral stances and also annotate if a candidate is mentioned without an opinion expression. Further, we annotate if the tweet is written in an offensive style. This enables us to analyze if supporters of Joe Biden and the Democratic Party communicate differently than supporters of Donald Trump and the Republican Party.

Observational longitudinal study. Participants living in France or Switzerland responded to online questionnaires measuring physical activity, physical and mental health, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Paired sample t-tests were used to assess differences in physical activity and sedentary behaviour before and during lockdown. Multiple linear regressions were used to investigate associations between changes in physical activity and changes in mental and physical health during lockdown. 267 (wave1) and 110 participants (wave2; 2 weeks later) were recruited. Lockdown resulted in higher time spent in walking and moderate physical activity (~10min/day) and in sedentary behaviour (~75min/day), compared to pre COVID-19. Increased physical activity during leisure time from week 2 to week 4 of lockdown was associated with improved physical health (ß=.24, p=.002). Additionally, an increase in sedentary behaviour during leisure time was associated with poorer physical health (ß=-.35, p=.002), mental health (ß=-.25, p=.003), and subjective vitality (ß=-.30, p=.004). Ensuring sufficient levels of physical activity and reducing sedentary time can play a vital role in helping people to cope with a major stressful event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cheval, Boris; Sivaramakrishnan, Hamsini; Maltagliati, Silvio; Fessler, Layan; Forestier, Cyril; Sarrazin, Philippe; Orsholits, Dan; Chalabaev, Aïna; Sander, David; Ntoumanis, Nikos; Boisgontier, Matthieu P",J Sports Sci,393,26

Some cardiac defects may be associated with a poor COVID-19 outcome. Risk estimation in ACHD is currently based on expert opinion. The aim of this study was to collect clinical outcome data and to identify risk factors for a complicated course of COVID-19 in patients with ACHD. METHODS: Twenty-five ACHD centres in nine European countries participated in the study. Consecutive patients with ACHD diagnosed with COVID-19 presenting to one of the participating centres between 27 March and 6 June 2020 were included. A complicated disease course was defined as hospitalisation for COVID-19 requiring non-invasive or invasive ventilation and/or inotropic support, or a fatal outcome. RESULTS: Of 105 patients with a mean age of 38±13 years (58% women), 13 had a complicated disease course, of whom 5 died. In univariable analysis, age (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7, per 5 years), &#8805;2 comorbidities (OR 7.1, 95% CI 2.1 to 24.5), body mass index of >25 kg/m2 (OR 7.2, 95% CI 1.9 to 28.3) and cyanotic heart disease (OR 13.2, 95% CI 2.5 to 68.4) were associated with a complicated disease course. In a multivariable logistic regression model, cyanotic heart disease was the most important predictor (OR 60.0, 95% CI 7.6 to 474.0). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with ACHD, general risk factors (age, obesity and multiple comorbidities) are associated with an increased risk of complicated COVID-19 course. Congenital cardiac defects at particularly high risk were cyanotic lesions, including unrepaired cyanotic defects or Eisenmenger syndrome.","Schwerzmann, Markus; Ruperti-Repilado, Francisco Javier; Baumgartner, Helmut; Bouma, Berto; Bouchardy, Judith; Budts, Werner; Campens, Laurence; Chessa, Massimo; Del Cerro Marin, Maria Jesús; Gabriel, Harald; Gallego, Pastora; Garcia-Orta, Rocio; Gonzalez, Ana Elvira; Jensen, Annette Schophuus; Ladouceur, Magalie; Miranda-Barrio, Berta; Morissens, Marielle; Pasquet, Agnes; Rueda, Joaquín; van den Bosch, Annemien E; van der Zwaan, Heleen Berdina; Tobler, Daniel; Greutmann, Matthias",Heart,393,23

Because iPS cells maintain the genetic information of the donor, they can be used to model individual differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. We found that human iPS cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (ACE2-iPS cells) can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In infected ACE2-iPS cells, the expression of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, budding of viral particles, production of progeny virus, double membrane spherules, and double-membrane vesicles were confirmed. We performed SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments on ACE2-iPS/ES cells from 8 individuals. Male iPS/ES cells were more capable of producing the virus compared with female iPS/ES cells. These findings suggest that ACE2-iPS cells can not only reproduce individual differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, but they are also a useful resource to clarify the causes of individual differences in COVID-19 due to genetic differences.","Sano, Emi; Deguchi, Sayaka; Sakamoto, Ayaka; Mimura, Natsumi; Hirabayashi, Ai; Muramoto, Yukiko; Noda, Takeshi; Yamamoto, Takuya; Takayama, Kazuo",iScience,393,20

Our understanding of the clinical characteristics of liver damage and the relationship with disease severity in COVID-19 is still limited. To investigate the serum hepatic enzyme activities in different phenotypes of COVID-19 patients, evaluate their relationship with the illness severity and analyze the correlation of glycyrrhizin treatment and abnormal liver enzyme activities, one hundred and forty-seven patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in a retrospective study that investigated hepatic dysfunction. Liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), Y-glutamyl transferase (GGT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were analyzed in these patients. Patients with diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG) treatment were further investigated. Of the 147 patients, 56 (38.1%) had abnormal ALT activity and 80 (54.4%) had abnormal AST activity. The peak of abnormal hepatic enzyme activities occurred at 3 to 6 days after on admission. Serum AST and LDH levels were elevated, while the SOD level was decreased in severe and critical patients, compared with mild cases. DG treatment may alleviate the abnormal liver enzyme activities in non-critical COVID-19 patients. Abnormal liver functions may be observed in patients with COVID-19, and were associated with SARS-CoV-2-induced acute liver damage. Glycyrrhizin treatment may be an effective therapeutic approach for the outcome of abnormal hepatic enzyme activities in severe COVID-19 cases. Serum hepatic enzyme tests may reflect the illness severity and should be monitored.","Liao, Fan-Lu; Peng, Ding-Hui; Chen, Wei; Hu, Han-Ning; Tang, Peng; Liu, Yan-Yuan; Luo, Yi; Yao, Tao",J Med Virol,393,24

Acute kidney injury requiring dialysis is common in critically ill patients and circuit clotting compromises efficacy of treatment. This study aims to analyze the circuit life and circuit clotting during continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) and intermittent hemodialysis in patients with and without COVID-19. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study in critically ill patients undergoing CKRT or intermittent hemodialysis between 1 February 2020 to 22 May 2020. Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 infection and contemporary controls who tested negative were included. Co-primary outcomes were functional circuit life for patients on CKRT and all circuit clotting events for patients on CKRT and/or intermittent hemodialysis. RESULTS: Seventy CKRT circuits and 32 intermittent hemodialysis sessions for 12 COVID-19 cases and 22 CKRT circuits and 18 intermittent hemodialysis sessions for 15 controls were analyzed. CKRT circuit clotting was more common in the COVID-19 group compared to the control group (64% vs 36%, p = 0.02), despite higher anticoagulation use in the COVID-19 group (41% vs 14%, p = 0.02). Functional CKRT circuit life was similar in COVID-19 patients and controls (median 11 vs 12 h, p = 0.69). On Cox regression analysis, circuit clotting was similar with hazard ratio (HR) 1.90 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89-4.04]; however, clotting was increased in COVID-19 patients after adjustment for anticoagulation use (HR: 3.31 [95% CI 1.49-7.33]). In patients with COVID-19, CKRT circuits with anticoagulation had a longer circuit life compared to CKRT circuits without anticoagulation (median 22 versus 7 h respectively, p < 0.001). Circuit clotting was similar in both groups undergoing intermittent hemodialysis. CONCLUSION: Dialysis clotting amongst COVID-19 patients is increased despite more anticoagulation use and the hazard for clotting is greater especially after adjusting for anticoagulation use. Circuit life was suboptimal in COVID-19 patients on circuits without anticoagulation and therefore routine use of anticoagulation amongst COVID-19 patients should be considered whenever possible.","Khoo, Benjamin Zhi En; Lim, Regina Shaoying; See, Yong Pey; Yeo, See Cheng",BMC Nephrol,393,13

Based on data from the first epidemic wave of n = 20 countries (i.e., the United States, Canada, Australia, the EU-15 countries, Norway, and Switzerland), we estimate the relative reduction in the number of new infections attributed to each NPI. Among the NPIs considered, bans of large gatherings were most effective, followed by venue and school closures, whereas stay-at-home orders and work-from-home orders were least effective.

Objective: To study the association of NSAID use with adverse outcomes in patients hospitalized with influenza or influenza pneumonia. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used propensity score matching among 7747 individuals aged 40 years or older who were hospitalized with influenza, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction or antigen testing, between 2010 and 2018. Data were collected using Danish nationwide registers. All analyses reported were performed on May 29, 2020. Exposures: Prescription fill of an NSAID within 60 days before admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95% CIs for intensive care unit admission and death within 30 days of admission. Results: A total of 7747 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 71 [59-80] years, 3980 [51.4%] men) with confirmed influenza were identified. Of these, 520 (6.7%) were exposed to NSAIDs. In the unmatched cohorts, 104 of 520 patients (20.0%) who used NSAIDs and 958 of 7227 patients (13.3%) who did not use NSAIDs were admitted to the intensive care unit. For death within 30 days of admission, we observed 37 events (7.1%) among those who used NSAIDs compared with 563 events (7.8%) among those who did not. Current NSAID use was associated with intensive care unit admission (RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.81; RD, 6.7%; 95% CI, 3.2% to 10.3%), while NSAID use was not associated with death (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.26; RD, -0.7%; 95% CI, -3.0% to 1.6%). In the matched cohorts, risks were unchanged for patients who used NSAIDs, while 83 ICU admissions (16.0%) and 36 deaths (6.9%) were observed among matched individuals who did not use NSAIDs. Matched (ie, adjusted) analyses yielded attenuated risk estimates for intensive care unit admission (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.63; RD, 4.0%; 95% CI, -0.6% to 8.7%) and death (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.60; RD, 0.2%; 95% CI, -2.9% to 3.3%). Associations were more pronounced among patients who used NSAIDs for a longer period (eg, for intensive care unit admission: RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.19 to 3.06; RD, 13.4%; 95% CI, 4.0% to 22.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of adult patients hospitalized with influenza, the use of NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day intensive care unit admission or death in adjusted analyses. There was an association between long-term use of NSAIDs and intensive care unit admission.","Lund, Lars Christian; Reilev, Mette; Hallas, Jesper; Kristensen, Kasper Bruun; Thomsen, Reimar Wernich; Christiansen, Christian Fynbo; Sørensen, Henrik Toft; Johansen, Nanna Borup; Brun, Nikolai Constantin; Voldstedlund, Marianne; Støvring, Henrik; Thomsen, Marianne Kragh; Christensen, Steffen; Pottegård, Anton",JAMA Netw Open,393,13

This study shows that social media analysis can be used as a crisis detector (e.g., understanding the sentiment of social media users regarding various pandemic outbreaks). The novel Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19), commonly known as coronavirus, has affected everyone worldwide in 2020. Streaming Twitter data have revealed the status of the COVID-19 outbreak in the most affected regions. This study focuses on identifying COVID-19 patients using tweets without requiring medical records to find the COVID-19 pandemic in Twitter messages (tweets). For this purpose, we propose herein an intelligent model using traditional machine learning-based approaches, such as support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), naïve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), and decision tree (DT) with the help of the term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to detect the COVID-19 pandemic in Twitter messages. The proposed intelligent traditional machine learning-based model classifies Twitter messages into four categories, namely, confirmed deaths, recovered, and suspected. For the experimental analysis, the tweet data on the COVID-19 pandemic are analyzed to evaluate the results of traditional machine learning approaches. A benchmark dataset for COVID-19 on Twitter messages is developed and can be used for future research studies. The experiments show that the results of the proposed approach are promising in detecting the COVID-19 pandemic in Twitter messages with overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score between 70% and 80% and the confusion matrix for machine learning approaches (i.e., SVM, NB, LR, RF, and DT) with the TF-IDF feature extraction technique. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","Amin, S.; Uddin, M.

An ecological study was performed to determine the spatial distribution of COVID-19 testing by ZIP code Tabulation Area and investigate if testing was associated with race or SES. METHODS: Data were obtained from the New York City coronavirus data repository and 2018 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. A combined index of SES was created using principal component analysis and incorporated household income, gross rent, poverty, education, working class status, unemployment, and occupants per room. Multivariable Poisson regressions were performed to predict the number of total tests and the ratio of positive tests to total tests performed, using the SES index, racial composition, and Hispanic composition as predictors. RESULTS: The number of total tests significantly increased with the increasing proportion of white residents (ß=0.004, SE=0.001, p=0.0032) but not with increasing Hispanic composition or SES index score. The ratio of positive tests to total tests significantly decreased with the increasing proportion of white residents in the ZIP code Tabulation Area (ß= -0.003, SE=0.000 6, p<0.001) and with increasing SES index score (ß= -0.001 6, SE=0.0007, p=0.0159).

Ultimately, we express our skeptical opinion on the comprehensive administration of such antiviral nanotheranostics, even when integrated into facemasks, because of their reported toxicities and the different NP parameters (e.g., size, shape, surface charge, and purity and chemical composition of NPs) that govern their end toxicity. We believe that more toxicity studies should be performed and be presented, clarifying the odds of the safe administration of nanotoxocological solutions and the relief of a worried public.","Mosselhy, Dina A; Virtanen, Jenni; Kant, Ravi; He, Wei; Elbahri, Mady; Sironen, Tarja",,393,3

The current vector control methods are unable to effectively reduce Aedes populations and thus fail to decrease dengue transmission. Hence, there is an urgent need for new tools and strategies to reduce dengue transmission in a wide range of settings. In this study, the Mosquito Home System (MHS) and Mosquito Home Aqua (MHAQ) formulations were assessed as commercial autodissemination traps in laboratory and small-scale field trials. METHOD: Multiple series of laboratory and small-scale field trials were performed to assess the efficacy of MHS and MHAQ exposed to Ae. aegypti. In the laboratory trials, various parameters such as fecundity, fertility, wing size, oviposition preferences, residual effects, and MHAQ transference to other containers through controlled experiments were tested. For small-scale field trials, the efficacy of the MHS and MHAQ approaches was determined to ascertain whether wild mosquitoes could transfer the MHAQ formulation from MHS stations to ovitraps. RESULTS: The data revealed that Ae. aegypti was highly susceptible to low concentrations of MHAQ formulations and had a residual effect of up to 3 months, with MHAQ exposure affecting fecundity, fertility, and mosquito wing size. In the oviposition studies, gravid females strongly preferred the hay infusion compared to tap water and MHAQ during egg-laying in the laboratory. Nevertheless, the use of commercial MHAQ by MHS was highly attractive in field settings compared to conventional ovitraps among local Aedes spp. mosquitoes. In addition, MHAQ horizontal transfer activities in the laboratory and small-scale field trials were demonstrated through larval bioassays. These findings demonstrated the potential of MHAQ to be transferred to new containers in each study site. CONCLUSION: This study provided proof of principle for the autodissemination of MHAQ. Through further refinement, this technique and device could become an effective oviposition trap and offer an alternative preventive tool for vector control management.","Mohd Ngesom, Ahmad Mohiddin; Ahmad Razi, Anis; Azizan, Nur Syahirah; Wasi Ahmad, Nazni; Md Lasim, Asmalia; Liang, Yanfeng; Greenhalgh, David; Min, Jasmine Chia Siew; Sahani, Mazrura; Hod, Rozita; Othman, Hidayatulfathi",Parasit Vectors,393,16

This study aimed firstly to compare CDUS detection of significant sac abnormalities with CTA. Secondly, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare financial estimates of the, predominantly CDUS based, local and Society of Vascular Surgery (SVS) protocols, the risk stratified European Society of Vascular Surgery (ESVS) protocol, and the CTA based National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) protocol. METHODS: Agreement between CDUS and CTA was assessed for detection of significant sac abnormalities. Surveillance protocols were extrapolated from published guidelines and applied to infrarenal EVAR patients active on local surveillance at a large, single centre. Surveillance intensity was dependent on presence of endoleak and subsequent risk of treatment failure in accordance with surveillance recommendations. Estimates for each surveillance protocol were inclusive of a range of published incidences of endoleak, contrast associated acute kidney injury (AKI), and excess hospital bed days, and estimated for a hypothetical five year surveillance period. RESULTS: The kappa coefficient between CDUS and CTA for detecting sac abnormalities was 0.68. Maximum five year surveillance cost estimates for the 289 active EVAR patients were £272 359 for SVS, £230 708 for ESVS, £643 802 for NICE, and £266 777 for local protocols, or £1 270, £1 076, £3 003, and £1 244 per patient. Differences in endoleak incidence accounted for a 1.1 to 1.4 fold increase in costs. AKI incidence accounted for a 3.3 to 6.2 fold increase in costs. CONCLUSION: A combined CTA and CDUS EVAR surveillance protocol, with CTA reserved for early seal assessment and confirmatory purposes, provides an economical approach without compromising detection of sac abnormalities. AKI, as opposed to direct imaging costs, accounted for the largest differences in surveillance cost estimates.","Smith, Luke; Thomas, Nicholas; Arnold, Andrew; Bell, Rachel; Zayed, Hany; Tyrrell, Mark; Padayachee, Soundrie",Eur. j. vasc. endovasc. surg,393,16

We adapt the standard model of willingness to pay (WTP) for mortality/morbidity risk reductions by incorporating a number of aspects that are highly relevant during an epidemic; namely, health-care capacity constraints, dynamic aspects of prevention (i.e., interventions aimed at flattening the epidemic curve), and distributional issues due to high heterogeneity in the underlying risks. The calibration of the model generates a WTP of the order of 24% of GDP. We conclude that the benefits in terms of lives saved and morbidity avoided can well justify the enormous economic costs generated by social distancing interventions. There is, however, significant that heterogeneity in WTP estimates depending on the degree of vulnerability to infection risk (e.g., by age), implying a large redistribution of income and well-being.","Echazu, Luciana; Nocetti, Diego C",Geneva Risk Insur Rev,393,16

To identify predictive markers of COVID-19 progress and outcome, we analyzed peripheral blood of 10 COVID-19-associated ARDS patients and 35 mild/moderate COVID-19 patients, not requiring intensive care. Using multi-parametric flow cytometry, we compared quantitative, phenotypic, and functional characteristics of circulating bulk immune cells, as well as SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-reactive T cells between the two groups. ARDS patients demonstrated significantly higher S-protein-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to non-ARDS patients. Of interest, comparison of circulating bulk T cells in ARDS patients to non-ARDS patients demonstrated decreased frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, with activated memory/effector T cells expressing tissue migration molecule CD11a++. Importantly, survival from ARDS (4/10) was accompanied by a recovery of the CD11a++ T cell subsets in peripheral blood. Conclusively, data on S-protein-reactive polyfunctional T cells indicate the ability of ARDS patients to generate antiviral protection. Furthermore, decreased frequencies of activated memory/effector T cells expressing tissue migratory molecule CD11a++ observed in circulation of ARDS patients might suggest their involvement in ARDS development and propose the CD11a-based immune signature as a possible prognostic marker.","Anft, Moritz; Paniskaki, Krystallenia; Blazquez-Navarro, Arturo; Doevelaar, Adrian; Seibert, Felix S; Hölzer, Bodo; Skrzypczyk, Sarah; Kohut, Eva; Kurek, Julia; Zapka, Jan; Wehler, Patrizia; Kaliszczyk, Sviatlana; Bajda, Sharon; Thieme, Constantin J; Roch, Toralf; Konik, Margarethe Justine; Berger, Marc Moritz; Brenner, Thorsten; Kölsch, Uwe; Meister, Toni L; Pfaender, Stephanie; Steinmann, Eike; Tempfer, Clemens; Watzl, Carsten; Dolff, Sebastian; Dittmer, Ulf; Abou-El-Enein, Mohamed; Westhoff, Timm H; Witzke, Oliver; Stervbo, Ulrik; Babel, Nina",Mol Ther,393,20

METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in selected databases (PubMed, WHO COVID-19), preprint servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv) and websites of European Public Health institutes. Documents that compared influenza estimates in the 2019/2020 season with previous seasons were included. Information synthesis was qualitative due to a high heterogeneity in the number and periods of comparative seasons, outcome measures and statistical methods. RESULTS: We included 23 records reporting from 15 countries/regions as well as 8 reports from European Public Health agencies. Estimates in the 2019/2020 season based on influenza virus tests (4 out of 7 countries/regions), defined influenza cases (8 out of 9), influenza positivity rate (7 out of 8), and severe complications (1 out of 2) were lower than in former seasons. Results from syndromic indicators, such as influenza-like-illness (ILI), were less clear or even raised (4 out of 7) after the influenza season indicating a misclassification with COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence synthesis suggests that NPIs targeted at SARS-CoV-2-transmission reduce influenza burden as well. Low threshold NPIs need to be more strongly emphasized in influenza prevention strategies.","Fricke, Lara Marleen; Glöckner, Stephan; Dreier, Maren; Lange, Berit",J. infect,393,16

The prevalence of PE in patients with respiratory deterioration at the Emergency Department (ED), the regular ward, and the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are not well-established. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate how often PE was present in individuals with COVID-19 and respiratory deterioration in different settings, and whether or not disease severity as measured by CT-severity score (CTSS) was related to the occurrence of PE. PATIENTS/METHODS: Between April 6th and May 3rd, we enrolled 60 consecutive adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 from the ED, regular ward and ICU who met the pre-specified criteria for respiratory deterioration. RESULTS: A total of 24 (24/60: 40% (95% CI: 28-54%)) patients were diagnosed with PE, of whom 6 were in the ED (6/23: 26% (95% CI: 10-46%)), 8 in the regular ward (8/24: 33% (95% CI: 16-55%)), and 10 in the ICU (10/13: 77% (95% CI: 46-95%)). CTSS (per unit) was not associated with the occurrence of PE (age and sex-adjusted OR 1.06 (95%CI 0.98-1.15)). CONCLUSION: The number of PE diagnosis among patients with COVID-19 and respiratory deterioration was high; 26% in the ED, 33% in the regular ward and 77% in the ICU respectively. In our cohort CTSS was not associated with the occurrence of PE. Based on the high number of patients diagnosed with PE among those scanned we recommend a low threshold for performing computed tomography angiography in patients with COVID-19 and respiratory deterioration.","Brüggemann, Renée A G; Spaetgens, Bart; Gietema, Hester A; Brouns, Steffie H A; Stassen, Patricia M; Magdelijns, Fabienne J; Rennenberg, Roger J; Henry, Ronald M A; Mulder, Mark M G; van Bussel, Bas C T; Schnabel, Ronny M; van der Horst, Iwan C C; Wildberger, Joachim E; Stehouwer, Coen D A; Ten Cate, Hugo",Thromb Res,393,1

The secondary aims were to identify any other prognostic factors for cholesteatoma recidivism. METHODS: A retrospective single-centre study of 312 patients who underwent cholesteatoma surgery under the care of a single-surgeon, between 2004 and 2018, was performed. Waiting times for surgery were categorised into &#8804; 90 days, 91-180 days, 181-270 days and > 271 days. The outcome measures were cholesteatoma recidivism and major complications (facial nerve palsy or intracranial complications). RESULTS: The mean age was 36.1 years ± 21.5 with 242 adults (77.6%) and 70 children (22.4%). The mean waiting time for surgery was 126.2 days (4.1 months) ± 96.0 days and the overall rate of recidivism was 11.2% (35/312 patients). No instances of facial nerve palsy or intracranial complications were identified. Rates of recidivism by waiting time for surgery were: 15.3% for 118 patients who waited &#8804; 90 days, 9.7% for 134 patients who waited 91-180 days, 6.7% for 30 patients who waited 181-270 days and 4.3% for 23 patients who waited > 271 days. There was no significant difference amongst the different waiting time groups for rates of recidivism (p = 0.266). CONCLUSION: Increased waiting times for cholesteatoma surgery do not appear to be associated with increased rates of recidivism or major complications. Clinical judgement will always be required for complicated disease or patients with additional risk factors. The other prognostic factors for recidivism identified in this study were age (< 15 years) and congenital cholesteatoma.","Hussain, Mohammed Hassan; Mair, Manish; Mahmood, Sara; Sakagiannis, Georgios; Rojoa, Djamila M; Raheman, Firas J; Irvine, Esmee; Rea, Peter",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,393,1

Before and after monitoring, cognitive and affective empathy in subjects was evaluated with the questionnaire. Both cognitive and affective empathy scores were unchanged during monitoring in subjects. However, affective empathy's change rate in the inactive group was higher than that in the active group. Furthermore, affective empathy's change rate was negatively correlated with sitting time in inactive group subjects, implying that staying at home with a few amounts of physical activity would contribute to treating empathy in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shima, Takeru; Jesmin, Subrina; Nakao, Hayato; Tai, Kentaro; Shimofure, Tomonori; Arai, Yoshihiro; Kiyama, Keiko; Onizawa, Yoko",Asia Pac J Public Health,393,20

It seems that asymptomatic population may contribute importantly to the spread of the disease. Transmission from asymptomatic pregnant patients' needs to be characterized in larger population cohorts and symptom assessment needs to be standardized. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of SARS CoV-2 infection in an unselected obstetrical population and to describe their presentation and clinical evolution. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed. Medical records of pregnant women admitted at the Obstetrics & Gynecology department of Clínica Dávila for labor & delivery, between April 27th and June 7th, 2020 were reviewed. All patients were screened with RT-PCR for SARS CoV-2 at admission. After delivery, positive cases were inquired by the researchers for clinical symptoms presented before admission and clinical evolution. All neonates born from mothers with confirmed SARS CoV-2 were isolated and tested for SARS CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: A total of 586 patients were tested for SARS CoV-2 during the study period. Outcomes were obtained from 583 patients which were included in the study. Thirty-seven pregnant women had a positive test for SARS CoV-2 at admission. Cumulative prevalence of confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection was 6.35% (37/583) [CI 95%: 4.63-8.65]. From confirmed cases, 43.2% (16/37) were asymptomatic. From symptomatic patients 85.7% (18/21) had mild symptoms and evolved without complications and 14.3% (3/21) presented severe symptoms requiring admission to intensive care unit. Only 5.4% (2/37) of the neonates born to mothers with a positive test at admission had a positive RT-PCR for SARS CoV-2. CONCLUSION: In our study nearly half of pregnant patients with SARS CoV-2 were asymptomatic at the time of delivery.

On a routine basis, our laboratory carries out a research activity on functionalities of molecules derived from algae using in silico tools. We have implemented our skills in algae biology and in modeling, as tests in order to identify molecules expressed by the genus Arthrospira showing an antiviral potential and more particularly anti-SARS-CoV-2. Using consensus docking and redocking with Autodock Vina and SwissDock, we were able to identify several promising molecules from Arthrospira: phycocyanobilin, phycoerythrobilin, phycourobilin, and folic acid. These four compounds showed reliable binding energies comprised between - 6.95 and - 7.45 kcal.mol-1 in Autodock Vina and between - 9.285 and - 10.35 kcal.mol-1 with SwissDock.

The data on patient's perceptions and other control variables are taken from Client Exit Interviews part of the HFA survey. Two-stage residual inclusion, Ordered Logistic Regression and Least square dummy variable techniques are used to investigate the relationship between technical efficiency and patients' satisfaction level. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) AND RESULTS: The average efficiency score for Pakistan's DHQHs is 0.52, and not a single hospital is fully efficient. Moreover, the relationship between technical efficiency and patients' satisfaction is found to be negative and statistically significant indicating that an increase in hospital efficiency tends to decrease patients' satisfaction. The disaggregated analysis reveals that patients' satisfaction associated with the healthcare provider attitude and communication is more affected by technical efficiency. CONCLUSION: Patients' satisfaction level is more sensitive to physician's attitude and communication. This makes sense because the longer the consultation time, the more accurate the diagnosis would be.

pathogenesis Results and discussion: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs through contact with airway secretions from a symptomatic patient However, scientific evidence encourages transmission by asymptomatic and/or oligosymptomatic patients Immunopathological studies suggest that the hypercytokinaemia promotes lung tissue damage and, subsequently, organ and system involvement, leading to decompensation, organ dysfunction and death Regarding the humoral response, the high titers of B lymphocytes and antibodies, traditionally, correlated with the protection of the host, may be associated with the severity of the disease by SARS-CoV-2 Conclusion: The host&#039;s immune response is determinant in the pathogenesis of Covid-19 However, further in vivo and/or in vitro studies are needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and, thus, assist in the development of a vaccine and/or therapeutic target RESUMEN Introducción: La enfermedad por coronavirus 2019

Considering the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, it is essential to devise methods to minimize aerosolization and hence ensure safety of the healthcare workers during the operative procedure. METHODS: Two disposable surgical drapes are used to create a closed pocket prior to commencement of mastoid bone-drilling. This limits aerosolization of bone-dust in the external operating theatre environment. CONCLUSION: Two-drape closed pocket technique is an easy, cost-effective and safe method to limit aerosolization of tissue particles during mastoidectomy.","Das, Arindam; Mitra, Sandipta; Kumar, Soutrik; Sengupta, Arunabha",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,393,16

We aimed to identify effective interventions to reduce social isolation and loneliness that are compatible with COVID-19 shielding and social distancing measures. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this rapid systematic review, we searched six electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and SCOPUS) from inception to April 2020 for systematic reviews appraising interventions for loneliness and/or social isolation. Primary studies from those reviews were eligible if they included: 1) participants in a non-hospital setting; 2) interventions to reduce social isolation and/or loneliness that would be feasible during COVID-19 shielding measures; 3) a relevant control group; and 4) quantitative measures of social isolation, social support or loneliness. At least two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Downs and Black checklist. Study registration: PROSPERO CRD42020178654. We identified 45 RCTs and 13 non-randomised controlled trials; none were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The nature, type, and potential effectiveness of interventions varied greatly. Effective interventions for loneliness include psychological therapies such as mindfulness, lessons on friendship, robotic pets, and social facilitation software. Few interventions improved social isolation. Overall, 37 of 58 studies were of ""Fair"" quality, as measured by the Downs & Black checklist. The main study limitations identified were the inclusion of studies of variable quality; the applicability of our findings to the entire population; and the current poor understanding of the types of loneliness and isolation experienced by different groups affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Many effective interventions involved cognitive or educational components, or facilitated communication between peers. These interventions may require minor modifications to align with COVID-19 shielding/social distancing measures. Future high-quality randomised controlled trials conducted under shielding/social distancing constraints are urgently needed.","Williams, Christopher Y K; Townson, Adam T; Kapur, Milan; Ferreira, Alice F; Nunn, Rebecca; Galante, Julieta; Phillips, Veronica; Gentry, Sarah; Usher-Smith, Juliet A",PLoS One,393,24

The technology is growing with three major advantages of high speed, lower latency and to connect more devices at the same time. In the recent pandemic event of Covid-19, many believe that for the achievement of high speed in 5G, it will be required to have high power and this high power will decrease the immune system in short term. But actually, the reality doesn’t support the above condition. This paper defines how the speed will increase with the help of low bit error rate and also through different useful techniques thereby not just by increasing the power. In addition of high-frequency 5G radiation to an already complex mix of lower frequencies, the implementation will contribute to a negative public health outcome both from physical and mental health perspectives to a certain extent.

Economic instability is presented as the most important trend in the modern economy and significant factor forming new requirements for supply chains. This, in turn, involves the improvement of applied technologies and development of new technologies, as well as the search for progressive technical and managerial solutions to meet the interests of a wide range of business entities and consumers of goods and services. A distinctive feature of this study is the fact that economic instability is viewed by the authors through the prism of both economic and non-economic processes having, inter alia, an impact on the economic system, including political, military, environmental, epidemiological and other processes. The article focuses on the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, as well as its impact on logistics solutions, and the specific demands on supply chains. It is substantiated that the introduction of technical and managerial innovations in this area will allow us to take into account the features and consequences of the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and to effectively influence the processes associated with improving supply chains.

Healthcare systems everywhere in the world are under pressure. Being a component of essential health services, family planning and abortion services should continue to cater the population in order to prevent the complications arising from unintended pregnancies and sudden rise in STIs. Due to airborne nature of transmission of the virus, it is advisable for all consultations relating to family planning services to be done remotely unless and until visit is absolutely necessary. Contraception initiation and continuation can be done by telemedicine in most individuals. Post partum contraception can be advised before discharge from hospital. In an individual planning for pregnancy, currently it is not advisable to discontinue contraceptive and plan for pregnancy as not much is known about the effect of the virus on foetal development. Also, pregnancy requires routine antenatal and peripartum care and complications arising from pregnancy may necessitate frequent hospital visits, exposing the individual to the risk of infection. Abortion services are time sensitive therefore should not be denied or delayed beyond legal limit. We need to change from real to virtual consultation to prevent the rise in unplanned pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections and unsafe abortions.","Sharma, K Aparna; Zangmo, Rinchen; Kumari, Archana; Roy, Kallol Kumar; Bharti, Juhi",Taiwan J Obstet Gynecol,393,20

Although efficacy has been demonstrated by randomized controlled trials, the evidence for effectiveness of the monovalent Enterovirus 71 (EV71) vaccine against HFMD remains unknown. This study aimed to assess the vaccine effectiveness for HFMD in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: Routinely collected vaccination and HFMD surveillance data were captured from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. We estimated the EV71 vaccine effectiveness using spatial ecologic and time-series analysis approaches. RESULTS: A total of 174,002 HFMD cases under 5 years of age were reported to the Guangzhou, China surveillance system from January 2016 to December 2018. A total of 408,664 children completed a two-dose EV71 vaccination series. In an ecologic analysis, a two-dose EV71 vaccination rate above the median conferred lower HFMD risk relative to a vaccination rate below the median (ratio ratio = 0.955, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.949, 0.962; P < .001). In the time-series approach, 0.9% fewer HFMD cases were associated with a 1% increase in the two-dose EV71 vaccination rate, but without statistical significance (P = .094). However, we detected statistically significant protective associations for HFMD among children 3 years of age (0.9% fewer HFMD cases with a 1% increased vaccination rate; P = .046), and for EV71 (1.4%; P = .012) and ""other viruses"" (1.3%; P = .002), although not for Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). CONCLUSION: Our findings, based on real-world data, provide evidence of EV71 vaccine effectiveness for preventing EV71 and ""other"" viruses associated with HFMD. An expanded program of EV71 vaccination is urgently needed.","Du, Zhicheng; Huang, Yong; Bloom, Michael S; Zhang, Zhoubin; Yang, Zhicong; Lu, Jianyun; Xu, Jianxiong; Hao, Yuantao",Hum Vaccin Immunother,393,20

We sought to compare physician visit rates for postpartum mental illness in Ontario, Canada, during the pandemic with rates expected based on prepandemic patterns. METHODS: In this population-based, repeated cross-sectional study using linked health administrative databases in Ontario, Canada, we used negative binomial regression to model expected visit rates per 1000 postpartum people for March-November 2020 based on prepandemic data (January 2016-February 2020). We compared observed visit rates to expected visit rates for each month of the pandemic period, generating absolute rate differences, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome was a visit to a primary care physician or a psychiatrist for any mental disorder. We stratified analyses by maternal sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: In March 2020, the visit rate was 43.5/1000, with a rate difference of 3.11/1000 (95% CI 1.25-4.89) and an IRR of 1.08 (95% CI 1.03-1.13) compared with the expected rate. In April, the rate difference (10.9/1000, 95% CI 9.14-12.6) and IRR (1.30, 95% CI 1.24-1.36) were higher; this level was generally sustained through November 2020. From April-November, we observed elevated visit rates across provider types and for diagnoses of anxiety, depressive and alcohol or substance use disorders. Observed increases from expected visit rates were greater for people 0-90 days postpartum compared with 91-365 days postpartum; increases were small among people living in low-income neighbourhoods. Public health units in the northern areas of the province did not see sustained elevations in visit rates after July; southern health units had elevated rates through to November. INTERPRETATION: Increased visits for mental health conditions among postpartum people during the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic suggest an increased need for effective and accessible mental health care for this population as the pandemic progresses.","Vigod, Simone N; Brown, Hilary K; Huang, Anjie; Fung, Kinwah; Barker, Lucy C; Hussain-Shamsy, Neesha; Wright, Elisabeth; Dennis, Cindy-Lee; Grigoriadis, Sophie; Gozdyra, Peter; Corsi, Daniel; Walker, Mark; Moineddin, Rahim",CMAJ,393,21

METHOD: We conducted a literature review of articles in the CAIRN, SCOPUS and PsycINFO databases using the keywords zazou, adolescent and COVID-19. RESULTS: The zazou movement was a manifestation of young people's denial of the war through derision. Initially discredited, it was subsequently violently repressed by collaborationists and supporters of Marshal Petain, as it was interpreted as an enemy of politics. In particular, it ran contrary to the Vichy regime's desire that young French men should spearhead the national revolution. The reaction among young people was to feel that they were being used by ageing politicians, who they considered were out of touch with reality. With respect to adolescents during the COVID-19 crisis, our review found that the French government has pressurised them to make sacrifices for the rest of the population, and has ignored their greater need for social links with peers. Many adolescents feel that they have been forgotten, in the midst of measures that have been imposed upon them with no explanation. This may have led, as in the 1940s, to a feeling of being instrumentalised and demonised by politicians. CONCLUSION: We argue that, in both cases, the dominant oppressive atmosphere has fostered similar behaviours and mental mechanisms. We therefore recommend that, rather than demonising young people, efforts should be made to include them in decision-making processes, in order to improve their understanding of the situation and encourage them to feel included.","De Weer, C.; Zdanowicz, N.; Dubois, T.",Psychiatria Danubina,393,24

The applications of DL techniques to medical images are further described in terms of image localization, segmentation, registration, and classification leading to COVID-19 detection. The reviews of recent papers indicate that the highest classification accuracy of 99.80% is obtained when InstaCovNet-19 DL method is applied to an X-ray dataset of 361 COVID-19 patients, 362 pneumonia patients and 365 normal people. Furthermore, it can be seen that the best classification accuracy of 99.054% can be achieved when EDL_COVID DL method is applied to a CT image dataset of 7500 samples where COVID-19 patients, lung tumor patients and normal people are equal in number. Moreover, we illustrate the potential DL techniques in drug or vaccine discovery in combating the coronavirus.

The observation function plays a critical role in the EnKF framework, connecting the unknown system variables with the observed data. Key differences in observed data and modeling assumptions have led to the use of different observation functions in the epidemic modeling literature. In this work, we present a novel computational analysis demonstrating the effects of observation function selection when using the EnKF for state and parameter estimation in this setting. In examining the use of four epidemiologically-inspired observation functions of different forms in connection with the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, we show how incorrect observation modeling assumptions (i.e., fitting incidence data with a prevalence model, or neglecting under-reporting) can lead to inaccurate filtering estimates and forecast predictions. Results demonstrate the importance of choosing an observation function that well interprets the available data on the corresponding EnKF estimates in several filtering scenarios, including state estimation with known parameters, and combined state and parameter estimation with both constant and time-varying parameters. Numerical experiments further illustrate how modifying the observation noise covariance matrix in the filter can help to account for uncertainty in the observation function in certain cases.","Mitchell, Leah; Arnold, Andrea",Math Biosci,393,6

A high-throughput assay based on differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) was therefore optimized and used to identify possible Mac1 ligands in small libraries of drugs and drug-like compounds. Numerous promising compounds included nucleotides, steroids, ß-lactams, and benzimidazoles. The main drawback to this approach was that a high percentage of compounds in some libraries were found to influence the observed Mac1 melting temperature. To prioritize DSF screening hits, the shapes of the observed melting curves and initial assay fluorescence were examined, and the results were compared with virtual screens performed using AutoDock Vina. The molecular basis for alternate ligand binding was also examined by determining a structure of one of the hits, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, with atomic resolution.","Virdi, Rajdeep S; Bavisotto, Robert V; Hopper, Nicholas C; Vuksanovic, Nemanja; Melkonian, Trevor R; Silvaggi, Nicholas R; Frick, David N",SLAS Discov,393,16

The underlying aim of the NIH Roadmap is to accelerate the movement of scientific findings into practical health care provisions through translational research. MAIN TEXT: Despite the advances in health sciences, emerging infectious diseases have become more frequent in recent decades. Furthermore, emerging and reemerging pathogens have led to several global public health challenges. A question, and to an extent a concern, arises from this: Why our health care system is experiencing several challenges in encountering the coronavirus outbreak, despite the ever-growing advances in sciences, and the exponential rise in the number of published articles in the first quartile journals and even the ones among the top 1%? CONCLUSION: Two responses could be potentially provided to the above question: First, there seems to be a significant gap between our theoretical knowledge and practice. And second that many scholars and scientists publish papers only to have a longer list of publications, and therefore publishing is viewed as a personal objective, rather than for improving communities' public health.","Jalali, Rostam; Hosseinian-Far, Amin; Mohammadi, Masoud",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,393,10

This has been shown to be a major factor in countries that have been successful in containing COVID-19 transmission. Early detection of cases is important, and the use of geospatial technology can support to detect and easily identify potential hotspots that will require timely response. The use of spatial analysis with geographic information systems (GIS) had proved to be effective in providing timely and effective solutions in supporting epidemic response and pandemics over the years. It has developed and evolved rapidly with a complete technological tool for representing data, model construction, visualization and platform construction among others. Methods: we conducted a geospatial analysis to develop a web mapping application using ArcMap and ArcGIS online to guide and support active case search of potential COVID-19 cases, within 500m radius of COVID-19 confirmed cases to improve detection and testing of suspected cases. Results: the web mapping application tool guides the active case search teams in the field, with clear boundaries on the houses to be visited within 500-meter radius of confirmed positive cases, to conduct active case search of all cases of severe acute respiratory illnesses (SARI), acute respiratory illnesses (ARI), pneumonia etc, to detect and test for COVID-19 towards containing the pandemic. Conclusion: the use of GIS and spatial statistical tools have become an important and valuable tool in decision-making and, more importantly, guiding health care professional and other stakeholders in the response being carried out in a more coherent and easy manner. It has proven to be effective in supporting the active case search process to rapidly detect, test and isolate cases during the process, towards containing the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bello, Isah Mohammed; Moyo, Thandekile Ntombikayise; Munyanyi, Manes; Akpan, Godwin Ubong; Isibor, Irene; Sunganai, Lincoln Charimari; Umar, Abubakar Sadiq; Krishnan, Ravi Shankar Santhana Gopala; Touray, Kebba; Rupfutse, Maxwell; Manangazira, Portia; Ntale, Alex Gasasira; Fussum, Daniel; Mkanda, Pascal",Pan Afr Med J,393,13

The study explored various drivers of telemedicine technology awareness, adoption and usage. These drives were studied from both the doctors and the patients' perspectives using the Push-Pull-Mooring (PPM) theoretical model. Design/methodology/approach An exploratory qualitative research was carried out with 24 doctors and 32 patients. This research was conducted in major urban cities of India. It was carried out during the economic lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The data was collected based upon a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire using telephonic interviews. Once thematic saturation was achieved, thematic content analysis was conducted. Finally, the themes were classified and analyzed using the PPM theoretical model Findings The data analysis indicated that there was the presence of all three factors, namely, push, pull and mooring. For the doctors, pull and push factors were more substantive than mooring factors. Although for the patients push and mooring factors were more important and pressing than pull factors. Research limitations/implications This study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic lockdown in India. The interview respondents were located only in urban India. Future studies could be conducted to explore similarities and differences in telemedicine adoption patterns during non-crisis times vis-a-vis crisis times in urban and rural settings. Practical implications The insights from this study could be used by medical service providers to leverage telemedicine technology to improve the business model, service delivery, pricing strategy, value proposition and behavioral characteristics. Patients on the other hand could gather perspectives regarding how best to use telemedicine technological services. Originality/value The authors provided an integrated perspective regarding telemedicine technology awareness, adoption and usage in an emerging economy of India during the critical times of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and the associated prolonged economic lockdown.

METHODS: A total of 80 HCWs in Suez Canal University Hospital in Ismailia, Egypt, and 80 controls were analyzed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS 21) questionnaire was used, and serum IL-6 level was determined in both groups. RESULTS: IL-6 levels were high in 81.2% (65) of HCWs compared to 36% (45) of controls (P < .05). The DASS score was higher in participants with high IL-6 levels (>3 ng/mL) than in those with mild to moderate levels (P < .05). The regression model revealed that the type of work as a healthcare staff, irregular or night shift, and stress were predictors of increased IL-6 levels among the studied sample (P < .05) (odds ratio = 20.30, 2.44, and 2.04, respectively).

Non-resonant PTIR images apparently provide rich details of the cell surface. However we show that non-resonant image contrast does not arise from the infrared absorption of surface molecules and is instead dominated by the mechanics of tip-sample contact. In contrast, spectra and images of the cellular surface can be selectively obtained by tuning the pulsing structure of the laser to restrict thermal wave penetration to the surface layer. Resonant PTIR images reveal surface structures and domains that range in size from about 20 nm to 1 um and are associated to the cytoplasmic membrane and its proximity. Resonant PTIR spectra of the cell surface are comparable to far-field IR spectra and provide the first selective measurement of the IR absorption spectrum of the cellular membrane of an intact cell. In resonant PTIR images, signal intensity, and therefore contrast, can be ascribed to a variety of factors, including mechanical, thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of the cellular surface. While PTIR images are difficult to interpret in terms of spectroscopic absorption, they are easy to collect and provide unique contrast mechanisms without any exogenous labeling. As such they provide a new paradigm in cellular imaging and membrane biology and can be used to address a range of critical questions, from the nature of membrane lipid domains to viral membrane fusion.","Quaroni, Luca",,393,1

Those caring for critically ill patients are especially susceptible due to high patient mortality, long hours, and regular encounters with trauma and ethical issues. Interventions to prevent burnout in this population are needed. Preliminary studies suggest debriefing sessions may reduce burnout. This study aims to assess whether participation in regular debriefing can prevent burnout in intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in two large academic medical centers. Two hundred ICU clinicians will be recruited with target enrollment of 100 physicians and 100 non-physicians (nurses, pharmacists, therapists). Participants must have worked in the ICU for the equivalent of at least 1 full time work week in the preceding 4 weeks. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to virtually attend biweekly debriefing sessions facilitated by a psychotherapist for 3 months or to a control arm without sessions. Our debriefs are modeled after Death Cafés, which are informal discussions focusing on death, dying, loss, grief, and illness. These sessions allow for reflection on distressing events and offer community and collaboration among hospital employees outside of work. The primary outcome is clinician burnout as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Score. Secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), respectively. Questionnaires will be administered prior to the intervention, at 1 month, at 3 months, and at 6 months after enrollment. These values will be compared between groups temporally. Qualitative feedback will also be collected and analyzed. DISCUSSION: With ICU clinician burnout rates exceeding 50%, Death Café debriefing sessions may prove to be an effective tool to avert this debilitating syndrome. With COVID-19 limiting social interactions and overloading ICUs worldwide, the virtual administration of the Death Café for ICU clinicians provides an innovative strategy to potentially mitigate burnout in this vulnerable population.

RESULTS: Almost 70 per cent of veterinarians indicated they were comfortable carrying out neutering on cats of four months of age, and approximately half of veterinarians indicated they would recommend neutering client-owned cats at four months of age if practice policy permitted. There was no association found between these practices and geographic risk factors. Instead, neutering at four months was associated with the gender of the veterinarian, their practice policy and whether they routinely neuter unowned cats. Veterinarians have contrasting beliefs on similar themes, depending on whether they neuter kittens at four months or not, including differing opinions on general anaesthetic, surgery risks, owner compliance and their perceptions of neutering practices within the wider profession. CONCLUSION: Familiarity and experience with the procedure, alongside perceived norms, are central to beliefs. We also highlight informational and learning barriers.","McDonald, Jenni; Clements, Jane",Vet. rec,393,24

Taking the central air conditioning system as an example, we analyze the mechanism and potential health risk of respiratory virus transmission in air-conditioned rooms and propose a method to study the risk of virus transmission in central air conditioning systems by investigating the data from medical experiments. The virus carrying capacity and the decay characteristics of indoor pathogen droplets are studied in this research. Additionally, the effects of air temperature and relative humidity on the virus survival in the air or on surfaces are investigated. The removal efficiency of infectious droplet nuclei by using an air conditioning filter was then determined. Thus, the transmission risk during the operation of the centralized air conditioning system is evaluated. The results show that the indoor temperature and humidity are controlled in the range of 20-25 °C and 40-70% by central air conditioning during the epidemic period, which not only benefits the health and comfort of residents, but also weakens the vitality of the virus. The larger the droplet size, the longer the viruses survive. Since the filter efficiency of the air conditioning filter increases with the increase in particle size, increasing the number of air changes of the circulating air volume can accelerate the removal of potential pathogen particles. Therefore, scientific operation of centralized air conditioning systems during the epidemic period has more advantages than disadvantages.","Jia, Yonghong; Xiang, Yue; Guo, Shurui; Guo, Lei; Guo, Luyao; Cheng, Zhu; Zhang, Yin; Zhang, Li; Long, Enshen",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection-induced acute infectious disease, which is featured by universal susceptibility and strong infectivity, and SHS (a status of low quality health) refers to a status of low-quality health. COVID-19 has gradually developed into a global pandemic, making the public in a high stress situation in physiological, psychological and social states in the short term. METHODS: From March 6 to 11, 2020, a large-scale cross-sectional survey was conducted by convenient sampling, and SHS assessment scale was used in the questionnaire. The ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors affecting SHS. RESULTS: In this study, 17,078 questionnaires were delivered with 16,820 effective questionnaires collected, and 10,715 subjects (63.7%) were found with SHS, with moderate SHS primarily. Physiological sub-scale scored the highest, followed by psychological and social sub-scales. Ordinal logistic regression analysis indicated that man, only-child, workers and farmers were risk factors of SHS. Protective factors of SHS included living in rural areas and townships, laid-off retirees and education degree. CONCLUSION: It shows many people in China place in a poor health status during COVID-19 pandemic. It is necessary that relevant departments pay more attention to people with poor health such as men, only-child, urban people, workers and farmers, and groups with high education degree during and after pandemic stabilization.","Pan, Yanbin; Yan, Jianlong; Lu, Wanxian; Shan, Miaohang",J Korean Acad Nurs,393,16

METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science until 9 June 2020. A combination of keywords and MeSH terms, such as COVID-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, neonates, newborn, infant, pregnancy, obstetrics, vertical transmission, maternal-foetal transmission and intrauterine transmission, were used in the search strategy. We included studies reporting neonatal outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 proven pregnancies or neonatal cases diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Eighty-six publications (45 case series and 41 case reports) were included in this review. Forty-five case series reported 1992 pregnant women, of which 1125 (56.5%) gave birth to 1141 neonates. A total of 281 (25%) neonates were preterm, and caesarean section (66%) was the preferred mode of delivery. Forty-one case reports describe 43 mother-baby dyads of which 16 were preterm, 9 were low birth weight and 27 were born by caesarean section. Overall, 58 neonates were reported with SARS-CoV-2 infection (4 had a congenital infection), of which 29 (50%) were symptomatic (23 required ICU) with respiratory symptoms being the predominant manifestation (70%). No mortality was reported in SARS-CoV-2-positive neonates. CONCLUSION: The limited low-quality evidence suggests that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections in neonates is extremely low. Unlike children, most COVID-positive neonates were symptomatic and required intensive care. Postpartum acquisition was the commonest mode of infection in neonates, although a few cases of congenital infection have also been reported.","Dhir, Shashi Kant; Kumar, Jogender; Meena, Jitendra; Kumar, Praveen",J. trop. pedriatr,393,13

Yet, little is known about the pathogenesis of systemic complications of COVID-19. Here, we create a murine model of SARS-CoV-2 induced severe systemic toxicity and multi-organ involvement by expressing the human ACE2 transgene in multiple tissues via viral delivery followed by systemic administration of SARS-CoV-2. The animals develop a profound phenotype within 7 days with severe weight loss, morbidity and failure to thrive. We demonstrate there is metabolic suppression of oxidative phosphorylation and the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in multiple organs with neutrophilia, lymphopenia and splenic atrophy mirroring human COVID-19 phenotypes. Animals had a significantly lower heart rate and electron microscopy demonstrated myofibrillar disarray and myocardial edema, a common pathogenic cardiac phenotype in human COVID-19. We perform metabolomic profiling of peripheral blood and identify a panel of TCA cycle metabolites that serve as biomarkers of depressed oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 induces epigenetic changes of DNA methylation, that affects expression of immune response genes and could in part contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Our model suggests that SARS-CoV-2 induced metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic changes in internal organs could contribute to systemic toxicity and lethality in COVID-19.","Li, Shen; Ma, Feiyang; Yokota, Tomohiro; Garcia, Gustavo; Palermo, Amelia; Wang, Yijie; Farrell, Colin; Wang, Yu-Chen; Wu, Rimao; Zhou, Zhiqiang; Pan, Calvin; Morselli, Marco; Teitell, Michael A; Ryazantsev, Sergey; Fishbein, Gregory A; Ten Hoeve, Johanna; Arboleda, Valerie A; Bloom, Joshua; Dillon, Barbara J; Pellegrini, Matteo; Lusis, Aldons J; Graeber, Thomas G; Arumugaswami, Vaithilingaraja; Deb, Arjun",JCI insight,393,17

Aim of this analysis was to describe patients with RMD according to their COVID-19 severity and to identify risk factors for hospitalisation. METHODS: Patients with RMD with PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reported to the German COVID-19 registry from 30 March to 1 November 2020 were evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate ORs for hospitalisation due to COVID-19. RESULTS: Data from 468 patients with RMD with SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported. Most frequent diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis, RA (48%). 29% of the patients were hospitalised, 5.5% needed ventilation. 19 patients died. Multivariable analysis showed that age >65 years (OR 2.24; 95% CI 1.12 to 4.47), but even more>75 years (OR 3.94; 95% CI 1.86 to 8.32), cardiovascular disease (CVD; OR 3.36; 95% CI 1.5 to 7.55), interstitial lung disease/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ILD/COPD) (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.2 to 6.49), chronic kidney disease (OR 2.96; 95% CI 1.16 to 7.5), moderate/high RMD disease activity (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.02 to 3.76) and treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) in dosages >5 mg/day (OR 3.67; 95% CI 1.49 to 9.05) were associated with higher odds of hospitalisation. Spondyloarthritis patients showed a smaller risk of hospitalisation compared with RA (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.91). CONCLUSION: Age was a major risk factor for hospitalisation as well as comorbidities such as CVD, ILD/COPD, chronic kidney disease and current or prior treatment with GCs. Moderate to high RMD disease activity was also an independent risk factor for hospitalisation, underlining the importance of continuing adequate RMD treatment during the pandemic.","Hasseli, Rebecca; Mueller-Ladner, Ulf; Hoyer, Bimba F; Krause, Andreas; Lorenz, Hanns-Martin; Pfeil, Alexander; Richter, Jutta; Schäfer, Martin; Schmeiser, Tim; Strangfeld, Anja; Schulze-Koops, Hendrik; Voll, Reinhard E; Specker, Christof; Regierer, Anne Constanze",,393,20

Current evidence confirms the role of dromedaries in primary human infections but does not explain the sporadic community cases. However, asymptomatic or subclinical cases could represent a possible source of infection in the community. METHODS: Archived human sera (7461) collected between 2011 and 2016 from healthy adult blood donors from 50 different nationalities in the western part of Saudi Arabia were obtained for MERS-CoV seroprevalence investigation. Samples were tested for MERS-CoV S1-specific antibodies (Abs) by ELISA and confirmed by testing for neutralizing Abs (nAbs) using both pseudotyped and live virus neutralization assays. RESULTS: Out of 7461 samples, 174 sera from individuals with 18 different nationalities were ELISA positive (2.3%, 95% CI 2.0-2.7). Presence of nAbs was confirmed in 17 samples (0.23%, 95% CI 0.1-0.4) of which one sample exhibited positivity in both neutralization assays. Confirmed seropositivity was identified in young (15-44 years) men and women from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yemen, Pakistan, Palestine, Sudan, and India without significant preference. CONCLUSIONS: An increasing trend of MERS-CoV seroprevalence was observed in the general population in western Saudi Arabia, suggesting that asymptomatic or mild infections might exist and act as an unrecognized source of infection. Seropositivity of individuals from different nationalities underscores the potential MERS exportation outside of the Arabian Peninsula. Thus, enhanced and continuous surveillance is highly warranted.","Degnah, Afnan A; Al-Amri, Sawsan S; Hassan, Ahmed M; Almasoud, Abdulrahman S; Mousa, Manar; Almahboub, Sarah A; Alhabbab, Rowa Y; Mirza, Ahmed A; Hindawi, Salwa I; Alharbi, Naif Khalaf; Azhar, Esam I; Hashem, Anwar M",J Infect Public Health,393,20

To avoid a larger outbreak in the worldwide, Chinese government carried out a series of strong strategies to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Home quarantine is the most important one to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In order to estimate the effect of population quarantine, we divide the population into seven categories for simulation. Based on a Least-Squares procedure and officially published data, the estimation of parameters for the proposed model is given. Numerical simulations show that the proposed model can describe the transmission of COVID-19 accurately, the corresponding prediction of the trend of the disease is given. The home quarantine strategy plays an important role in controlling the disease spread and speeding up the decline of COVID-19. The control reproduction number of most provinces in China are analyzed and discussed adequately. We should pay attention to that, though the epidemic is in decline in China, the disease still has high risk of human-to-human transmission continuously. Once the control strategy is removed, COVID-19 may become a normal epidemic disease just like flu. Further control for the disease is still necessary, we focus on the relationship between the spread rate of the virus and the meteorological conditions. A comprehensive meteorological index is introduced to represent the impact of meteorological factors on both high and low migration groups. As the progress on the new vaccine, we design detail vaccination strategies for COVID-19 in different control phases and show the effectiveness of efficient vaccination.

However, these strategies rely on community understanding and motivation to engage to ensure appropriate compliance and impact. To support current activities for COVID-19, the objectives of this narrative review was to identify the key determinants impacting on engagement. METHODS: An integrative narrative literature review focused on NPIs. We aimed to identify published peer-reviewed articles that focused on the general community (excluding healthcare workers), NPIs (including school closure, quarantine, isolation, physical distancing and hygiene behaviours), and factors/characteristics (including social, physical, psychological, capacity, motivation, economic and demographic) that impact on engagement. RESULTS: The results revealed that there are a range of demographic, social and psychological factors underpinning engagement with quarantine, school closures, and personal protective behaviours. Aside from the factors impacting on acceptance and compliance, there are several key community concerns about their use that need to be addressed including the potential for economic consequences. CONCLUSION: It is important that we acknowledge that these strategies will have an impact on an individual and the community. By understanding the barriers, we can identify what strategies need to be adopted to motivate individuals and improve community compliance. Using a behavioural framework to plan interventions based on these key barriers, will also ensure countries implement appropriate and targeted responses.","Seale, Holly; Dyer, Clare E F; Abdi, Ikram; Rahman, Kazi M; Sun, Yanni; Qureshi, Mohammed O; Dowell-Day, Alexander; Sward, Jonathon; Islam, M Saiful",BMC Infect Dis,393,20

Several Mpro inhibitors have been reported with potent enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity, including GC376, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II, and XII, with each containing a reactive warhead that covalently modifies the catalytic Cys145. Coupling structure-based drug design with the one-pot Ugi four-component reaction, we discovered one of the most potent noncovalent inhibitors, 23R (Jun8-76-3A) that is structurally distinct from the canonical Mpro inhibitor GC376. Significantly, 23R is highly selective compared with covalent inhibitors such as GC376, especially toward host proteases. The cocrystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with 23R revealed a previously unexplored binding site located in between the S2 and S4 pockets.

The database must be updated every time a new face arrives. In addition, the solution must be efficient, accurate and scalable. For this purpose, we present an online gaussian mixture-based clustering method (OGMC). The key idea of this method is the proposal that an identity can be represented by more than just one distribution or cluster. Using feature vectors (f-vectors) extracted from the incoming faces, OGMC generates clusters that may be connected to others depending on their proximity and their robustness. Every time a cluster is updated with a new sample, its connections are also updated. With this approach, we reduce the dependency of the clustering process on the order and the size of the incoming data and we are able to deal with complex data distributions. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods on large-scale face clustering benchmarks not only in accuracy, but also in efficiency and scalability.","Montero, David; Aginako, Naiara; Sierra, Basilio; Nieto, Marcos",,393,20

In Ghana, an estimated 8 out of every 10 children are anaemic. This study employed a novel approach to investigate the determinants of normal haemoglobin (Hb) concentration among children aged 6 to 59 months, using data from the Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys. The results showed that maternal schooling was positively associated with normal Hb concentration among children. Children of non-anaemic mothers were 1.67 (CI = 1.32, 2.10; P < 0.001) times more likely to have normal Hb concentration relative to children of anaemic mothers. Compared to mothers who had less than 4 antenatal care (ANC) visits, mothers who had at least 4 ANC visits increased the odds of their children having a normal Hb concentration by 1.62 (CI = 1.09, 2.40; P < 0.018). Children living in middle and rich households had respectively 1.48 (CI = 1.06, 2.07; p < 0.021) and 1.59 (CI = 1.08, 2.33; p < 0.018) increased odds of having a normal Hb concentration relative to those living in poor households. Maternal education, anaemia, ANC attendance, and household wealth index are strong determinants of normal Hb concentration among children in Ghana. Strategies aimed at addressing childhood anaemia should take into account maternal anaemia, education, poverty and ANC attendance.","Amugsi, Dickson A",Sci Rep,393,20

Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate whether anti-cancer therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy will increase the severity and mortality of cancer patients with COVID-19.Methods: Relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The search time was from December 1, 2019 to January 23, 2021. Meta-analysis was conducted using Revman 5.3 statistical software.Results: A total of 26 studies were included in this meta-analysis, involving 5571 cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Meta-analysis showed that surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy were not associated with disease severity or mortality (107/688, OR =1.30, 95% CI[0.79, 2.13], P =0.30; 1956/2674, OR =1.27, 95% CI [0.95, 1.69], P =0.10; 342/1455, OR =1.20, 95% CI [0.90, 1.61], P =0.21; 503/1378, OR =0.92, 95% CI [0.72, 1.19], P =0.54, respectively).Conclusion: In cancer patients with COVID-19, anti-cancer therapy had no adverse effect on disease severity or mortality.

Consequently, we sought to provide a blended and asynchronous teaching programme that would be delivered to anaesthetic trainees preparing for their postgraduate examinations. Six sessions of 90-minute duration were delivered during the months July, August and September 2020. Each of the six sessions was delivered live using a variety of online educational tools in addition to traditional didactic-style teaching by the presenters. Participants submitted requests for topics to be covered by the presenters in the final of the six sessions. The sessions were recorded and later uploaded onto an online educational learning platform for viewing at the participants' discretion. The live nature of the sessions ensured participant interaction and a sense of community that trainees had come to expect from previous face-to-face teaching sessions prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.Evaluation was via qualitative and quantitative means using preset questions using the Likert scale and a free-text comments box. The results demonstrated positive feedback across all sessions with particular relevance to the interactive element of the course, the content and delivery.This article describes the requirement for a method of continuing postgraduate medical education in an era where traditional face-to-face teaching is not possible and how the introduction of various innovative educational applications and resources can be used to further postgraduate medical education in the future.","Cooke, Peter Charles; Hajamohideen, Nisha; Gooneratne, Hasanthi",Postgrad. med. j,393,12

However, these SNPs explain only 25% of the overall genetic variance and suggest a role of rare variants in BD vulnerability. Here, we combined high-throughput genotyping data and whole-exome sequencing in cohorts of individuals with BD as well as in multiplex families with a high density of affected individuals in order to determine the contribution of both common and rare variants to BD genetic vulnerability. Using polygenic risk scores (PRS), we showed a strong contribution of common polymorphisms previously associated with BD and schizophrenia (SZ) and noticed that those specifically associated with SZ contributed more in familial forms of BD than in non-familial ones. The analysis of rare damaging variants shared by affected individuals in multiplex families with BD revealed a single interaction network enriched in neuronal and developmental biological pathways, as well as in the regulation of gene expression. We identified four genes with a higher mutation rate in individuals with BD than in the general population and showed that mutations in two of them were associated with specific clinical manifestations. In addition, we showed a significant negative correlation between PRS and the number of rare damaging variants specifically in unaffected individuals of multiplex families. Altogether, our results suggest that common and rare genetic variants both contribute to the familial aggregation of BD and this genetic architecture may explain the heterogeneity of clinical manifestations in multiplex families.","Courtois, Elisa; Schmid, Mark; Wajsbrot, Orly; Barau, Caroline; Le Corvoisier, Philippe; Aouizerate, Bruno; Bellivier, Frank; Belzeaux, Raoul; Dubertret, Caroline; Kahn, Jean-Pierre; Leboyer, Marion; Olie, Emilie; Passerieux, Christine; Polosan, Mircea; Etain, Bruno; Jamain, Stéphane",Transl Psychiatry,393,20

China, being the first to detect COVID-19 infection swiftly swung into anti-epidemic actions by the use of innovative risk communication and epidemic containment strategies. Italy and U.S., the next rapidly hit countries after China, however, experienced sustained infections and deaths due to delayed and ineffective response. Many African countries responded poorly to the COVID-19 pandemic as evidenced by the limited capacity for public health surveillance, poor leadership, low education and socioeconomic status, among others. Experience from China, Italy and U.S. suggests that a better response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa needs a strong public health leadership, proactive strategies, innovative risk communication about the pandemic, massive tests and isolation, and scaling-up community engagement. Lastly, African countries must collaborate with other countries to facilitate real-time information and experience exchange with other countries to avoid being left behind.","Olufadewa, Isaac Iyinoluwa; Adesina, Miracle Ayomikun; Ekpo, Marlene Davis; Akinloye, Seyi John; Iyanda, Temiloluwa Ololade; Nwachukwu, Pamela; Kodzo, Lalit Dzifa",,393,33

A comprehensive screening tool is therefore necessary to identify these needs. To date, no data exist on satisfaction with medical and therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 in terms of quality and quantity. The aim of this study is to develop a survey for use with COVID-19 patients during and after the end of the acute phase of the disease. METHODS: Following the definition of dimensions by a group of experts, and a literature search, proven survey instruments were searched for suitable items. In addition, specific questions were developed based on symptoms, and answer options were created with regard to to the complexity of the questions. RESULTS: The COVID-19 Rehabilitation Needs Survey (C19-RehabNeS) consists of the established 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36) together with the newly developed COVID-19-Rehabilitation Needs Questionnaire (C19-RehabNeQ) (11 further dimensions, respectively 57 items). CONCLUSION: C19-RehabNeS is a comprehensive survey to assess functional limitations and rehabilitation needs during and after infection with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). The strength of this survey is that it combines the assessment of important rehabilitation needs with assessment of satisfaction with the health services, treatment and therapy during the pandemic (C19-RehabNeQ) and assessment of patients' quality of life (SF-36). The C19-RehabNeS survey also enables collection of systematic information on patients with Post-COVID-19 syndrome (Long-COVID-19).","Lemhöfer, Christina; Gutenbrunner, Christoph; Schiller, Jörg; Loudovici-Krug, Dana; Best, Norman; Bökel, Andrea; Sturm, Christian",J Rehabil Med,393,16

Without question, reporting of its impact has been bolstered in large part through near real-time daily mapping of cases and fatalities. Though these maps serve as an effective political and social tool in communicating disease impact, most visualizations largely over-emphasize their usefulness for tracking disease progression and appropriate responses. Messy and inconsistent health data are a big part of this problem, as is a paucity of high-resolution spatial data to monitor health outcomes. Another issue is that the ease of producing out-of-the box products largely out paces the response to the core challenges inherent in the poor quality of most geo-referenced data. Adopting a GIScience approach, and in particular, making use of location-based intelligence tools, can improve the shortcomings in data reporting and more accurately reveal how COVID-19 will have a long-term impact on global health.","Rosenkrantz, Leah; Schuurman, Nadine; Bell, Nathaniel; Amram, Ofer",Health Place,393,1

Despite its benefits on survival and quality of life, it is associated with a considerable financial burden on society including sick leave. Our study aimed to explore the barriers that obstruct return to work after coronary artery bypass grafting. Methods We performed a qualitative study with in-depth interviewing of patients 6 months after their surgery. We included ten working patients and interviewed them and their spouses at home. The interviews were transcribed and two investigators independently searched the transcriptions for barriers that had obstructed return to work. Results Based on the interviews we were able to distinguish four main groups of barriers: 'personal', 'healthcare', 'work' and 'law & regulation.' The personal barriers were subgrouped in affective, physical, cognitive, social and individually determined factors. Conclusion In a qualitative study we showed that personal barriers as well as barriers regarding healthcare, work and law & regulation, were perceived by patients as important factors obstructing return to work after coronary artery bypass grafting. To overcome the identified barriers, the process of return to work could preferably be initiated during the hospital phase, started during cardiac rehabilitation, and coordinated by a case-managing professional.","Blokzijl, Fredrike; Onrust, Marisa; Dieperink, Willem; Keus, Frederik; van der Horst, Iwan C C; Paans, Wolter; Mariani, Massimo A; Reneman, Michiel F",J. occup. rehabil,393,16

The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of physical therapists regarding the professional and ethical issues they encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The current study used reflexive thematic analysis, a qualitative research design developed by Braun and Clarke, to analyze individual interviews. RESULTS: Analysis of the coded interviews produced 6 primary themes (uncertainty, physical therapist's role, ethical dilemmas and moral distress, emotions, providing care and working conditions, and management and leadership influence) and associated subthemes. CONCLUSIONS: Physical therapists reported numerous professional and ethical issues across the individual, organizational, and societal realms during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study highlights the need for education and resources to prepare physical therapists for professional and ethical issues encountered during pandemics. Specifically, there is a need to define the physical therapist's role in pandemics and prepare the physical therapy personnel for dealing with ethical issues, stress, uncertainty, and organizational changes associated with pandemics. Ethical guidelines would support organizations in delineating fair processes for triage and allocation of scarce resources for acute care physical therapy during healthcare emergencies. IMPACT: The COVID-19 pandemic has produced significant changes in healthcare and physical therapist practice. This study reports results of the first research study focusing on professional and ethical issues experienced by physical therapists in acute care during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the US faces an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases and deaths, results of this study may contribute to physical therapists' preparation for and response to professional and ethical issues encountered in acute care during the pandemic.","Ditwiler, Rebecca E; Swisher, Laura L; Hardwick, Dustin D",Phys. ther,393,4

The objective of this study was to characterize ethnic differences in clinical presentation and outcomes from COVID-19 among older U.S. adults. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study within two geriatric emergency departments (GEDs) at a large academic health system. One hundred patients 65 years or older who visited a GED between March 10, 2020 and August 9, 2020 and tested positive for COVID-19 were examined. Electronic medical records were used to determine presenting COVID-19-related symptoms, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes. Descriptive statistics are reported with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: In the overall sample, mean age was 75.9 years; 18% were 85 years or older; 50% were male; and 46.0% were Hispanic. Relative to non-Hispanic patients with COVID-19, Hispanic patients with COVID-19 had a higher percentage of shortness of breath (78.3% vs. 51.9%; difference: 26.4%; 95% CI 7.6-42.5%), pneumonia (82.6% vs. 50.0%; difference: 32.6%; 95% CI 14.1-47.9%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (13.0% vs. 1.9%; difference: 11.1%; 95% CI 0.7-23.9%), and acute kidney failure (41.3% vs. 22.2%; difference: 19.1%; 95% CI 0.9-36.0%). Rates of other poor outcomes, including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, return visits to the GED within 30 days of discharge, or death, did not significantly differ between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data show that older Hispanic patients relative to non-Hispanic patients with COVID-19 presenting to a GED did not experience worse outcomes, including hospitalization, ICU admission, 30-day return visits to the GED, or death.","Shadyab, Aladdin H; Tolia, Vaishal M; Brennan, Jesse J; Chan, Theodore C; Castillo, Edward M",J. emerg. med,393,9

BACKGROUND: In the United Kingdom, cardiac surgery for coronary artery disease (CAD) was dramatically reduced during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many patients with ""surgical disease"" instead underwent PCI. METHODS: Between 1 March 2020 and 31 July 2020, 215 patients with recognized ""surgical"" CAD who underwent PCI were enrolled in the prospective UK-ReVasc Registry (ReVR). 30-day major cardiovascular event outcomes were collected. Findings in ReVR patients were directly compared to reference PCI and isolated CABG pre-COVID-19 data from British Cardiovascular Intervention Society (BCIS) and National Cardiac Audit Programme (NCAP) databases. RESULTS: ReVR patients had higher incidence of diabetes (34.4% vs 26.4%, P = .008), multi-vessel disease with left main stem disease (51.4% vs 3.0%, P < .001) and left anterior descending artery involvement (94.8% vs 67.2%, P < .001) compared to BCIS data. SYNTAX Score in ReVR was high (mean 28.0). Increased use of transradial access (93.3% vs 88.6%, P = .03), intracoronary imaging (43.6% vs 14.4%, P < .001) and calcium modification (23.6% vs 3.5%, P < .001) was observed. No difference in in-hospital mortality was demonstrated compared to PCI and CABG data (ReVR 1.4% vs BCIS 0.7%, P = .19; vs NCAP 1.0%, P = .48). Inpatient stay was half compared to CABG (3.0 vs 6.0 days). Low-event rates in ReVR were maintained to 30-day follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: PCI undertaken using contemporary techniques produces excellent short-term results in patients who would be otherwise CABG candidates. Longer-term follow-up is essential to determine whether these outcomes are maintained over time.","Kite, Thomas A; Ladwiniec, Andrew; Owens, Colum G; Chase, Alexander; Shaukat, Aadil; Mozid, Abdul M; O039,; Kane, Peter; Routledge, Helen; Perera, Divaka; Jain, Ajay K; Palmer, Nick; Hoole, Stephen P; Egred, Mohaned; Sinha, Manas K; Cahill, Thomas J; Candilio, Luciano; Anantharam, Brijesh; Byrne, Jonathan; Walsh, Simon J; McEntegart, Margaret; Kean, Sharon; Siddique, Laraib; Budgeon, Charley; Curzen, Nick; Berry, Colin; Ludman, Peter; Gershlick, Anthony H",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,393,12

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe clinical characteristics and clinical course of ICU COVID-19 patients, and to determine risk factors for ICU mortality of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Prospective, multicentre, cohort study that enrolled critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted into 30 ICUs from Spain and Andorra. Consecutive patients from March 12th to May 26th, 2020 were enrolled if they had died or were discharged from ICU during the study period. Demographics, symptoms, vital signs, laboratory markers, supportive therapies, pharmacological treatments, medical and infectious complications were reported and compared between deceased and discharged patients. RESULTS: A total of 663 patients were included. Overall ICU mortality was 31% (203 patients). At ICU admission non-survivors were more hypoxemic [SpO2 with non-rebreather mask, 90 (IQR 83 to 93) vs. 91 (IQR 87 to 94); P<.001] and with higher sequential organ failure assessment score [SOFA, 7 (IQR 5 to 9) vs. 4 (IQR 3 to 7); P<.001]. Complications were more frequent in non-survivors: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95% vs. 89%; P=.009), acute kidney injury (AKI) (58% vs. 24%; P<10-16), shock (42% vs. 14%; P<10-13), and arrhythmias (24% vs. 11%; P<10-4). Respiratory super-infection, bloodstream infection and septic shock were higher in non-survivors (33% vs. 25%; P=.03, 33% vs. 23%; P=.01 and 15% vs. 3%, P=10-7), respectively. The multivariable regression model showed that age was associated with mortality, with every year increasing risk-of-death by 1% (95%CI: 1 to 10, P=.014). Each 5-point increase in APACHE II independently predicted mortality [OR: 1.508 (1.081, 2.104), P=.015].

As a result, it has been difficult to treat cancer patients on time, which adversely affects their prognosis. To address this problem, cancer centers must develop a strategic plan to manage both inpatients and outpatients during the pandemic, provide them with the necessary treatment, and at the same time prevent the spread of the virus among patients, visitors and medical staff. METHODS: Based upon the epidemic situation in Zhejiang Province, China, the number of running non-emergency medical wards in the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital was gradually increased in a controlled manner. All staff of the hospital received COVID-19 preventive training and was provided with three different levels of protection according to the risks of their services. Only patients without a known history of SARS-CoV-2 contact were eligible to schedule an appointment. Body temperature was measured on all patients upon their arrival at the hospital. Chest CT image, blood cell counting and travel/contact history were investigated in patients with fever. Respiratory tract samples, such as sputum and throat swabs, from all patients, including those clinically suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, were collected for nucleic acid detection of SARS-CoV-2 before treatment. RESULTS: A total of 3697 inpatients and 416 outpatients seeking cancer treatment were enrolled from February 1 to April 3, 2020, in compliance with the hospital's infection-control interventions. The clinicopathological parameters of the patients were summarized herein. 4237 samples from 4101 patients produced negative RNA testing results. Four clinically suspected patients all presented negative RNA test results and were excluded from the SARS-CoV-2 infection through follow-up retesting and monitoring. Seven patients with only N-gene positive results were retested, followed by CT scan and SARS-CoV-2 contact history investigation. All of them were finally diagnosed as non-infected patients. There was one outpatient who was confirmed positive by virus RNA test and then followed up. She might be an asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed case. During the study period, there was no SARS-CoV-2 infection among staff, patients and escorts of patients in the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital. CONCLUSION: This study suggested our infection-control interventions, including viral nucleic acid test, could be used as a reliable method to screen cancer patients in the area with moderate COVID-19 prevalence. Cancer may not be a high-risk factor of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Xu, Songxiao; Cheng, Xiangdong; Pan, Zhiwen; Song, Qian; Wang, Yihong; Xiong, Juan; Chen, Yongyi; Fan, Fan; Zhu, Jing; Wu, Wanying; Deng, Xueying; Yu, Yanpin; Xu, Xiaohong; Chen, Wenhu; Zhu, Tao; Yu, Yang; Liu, Kaizhong; Shao, Guoliang; Chen, Ming; Yu, Enyan",BMC Cancer,393,16

Unlike previous pandemics, the pace of the spread of the virus has been matched by the pace of publications, not just in traditional journals, but also in preprint servers. Not all publication findings are true, and sifting through the firehose of data has been challenging to peer reviewers, editors, as well as to consumers of the literature, that is, scientists, healthcare workers, and the general public. There has been an equally exponential rise in the public discussion on social media.

However, asthma and atopy do not appear to be overrepresented comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, and hypotheses attempt to explain this observation. As COVID-19 continues to spread globally, it is imperative to understand how disease outcomes may be influenced in this population to guide patient care. RECENT FINDINGS: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the principal host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 (TMRSS2) is the main priming protease. Models have linked atopic endotypes to reductions in ACE2 and increases in TMRSS2 on respiratory epithelia. Epidemiologic and experimental findings imply alterations in ACE2 expression correlate with clinical COVID-19 disease, but limitations restrict the ability to draw direct conclusions. SUMMARY: There is reasonable evidence to assert atopic endotypes modulate COVID-19 susceptibility, but it remains premature to classify this association as protective or deleterious. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease and epidemiologic studies should focus on investigating COVID-19 outcomes by underlying endotype. Direct experimental and clinical evidence is needed to draw definitive conclusions on how the complex interplay of ACE2 and TMRSS2 affect viral entry.

Although the route for viral transmission remains a mystery, SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal reservoir, likely that of bat. The clinical features of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue, are similar to those of many acute respiratory infections. There is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19, but antiviral therapy combined with supportive care is the main strategy.

The review aimed to evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence, process, and outcomes of OHCA. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE, and pre-print websites was performed. Studies reporting comparative data on OHCA within the same jurisdiction, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Study quality was assessed based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Ten studies reporting data from 35,379 OHCA events were included. There was a 120% increase in OHCA events since the pandemic. Time from OHCA to ambulance arrival was longer during the pandemic (pâ¯=â¯0.036).

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the utilization of physician consultations, specialist referrals, hospital admissions, and the recognition of incident diseases in Germany for this age group during the COVID-19 lockdown. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: 1,095 general practitioners' (GPs) and 960 specialist practices in Germany. SUBJECTS: 2.45 million older patients aged 65 or older. METHODS: The number of documented physician consultations, specialist referrals, hospital admissions, and incident diagnoses during the imposed lockdown in 2020 was descriptively analyzed and compared to 2019. RESULTS: Physician consultations decrease slightly in February (-2%), increase before the imposed lockdown in March (+9%), and decline in April (-18%) and May (-14%) 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Volumes of hospital admissions decrease earlier and more intensely than physician consultations (-39% vs. -6% respectively). Overall, 15%, 16%, and 18% fewer incident diagnoses were documented by GPs, neurologists, and diabetologists respectively in 2020. Diabetes, dementia, depression, cancer, and stroke were diagnosed less frequently during the lockdown (-17% to -26%), meaning that the decrease in the recognition of diseases was greater than the decrease in physician consultations. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that organizational changes were adopted quickly by practice management, but also raise concerns about the maintenance of routine care.

Two stable configurations of D13-9001 are discovered inside the distal pocket which could be one of the primary reason of the greater efficacy of D13-9001. Free energy barrier upon changing one state to another is calculated by employing umbrella sampling method. Finally, F178 is mutated to have the complete picture as it contributes a significant amount to the binding energy irrespective of the three inhibitors.

METHODS: We designed a retrospective cohort study with the collaboration of two Italian Serie A teams. Soccer players from both rosters (58 athletes) were systematically analysed. For every SARS-CoV-2 positive athlete, the Italian Soccer Federation protocol requested full blood tests including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), along with a complete cardiovascular examination. We extended the analysis to SARS-CoV-2 negative athletes. RESULTS: A total of 13/58 players (22.4%) suffered from SARS-CoV-2infection: all had a negative cardiovascular examination and 2/13 (15%) showed increased hs-cTnI values (120.8 pg/ml and 72,6 pg/ml, respectively; upper reference level 39.2 pg/ml), which did not track with inflammatory biomarkers. Regarding the 45/58 (77.6%) non infected athletes, a slight increase in hs-cTnI was observed in 2 (4.5%) subjects (values: 61 pg/ml and 75 pg/ml respectively).

Declaring public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC) is a cornerstone of the IHR. Here we review how PHEIC are formally declared, the diseases for which such declarations have been made from 2007 until 2020 and justifications for such declarations. KEY FINDINGS: Six events were declared PHEIC between 2007 and 2020: the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, Ebola (West African outbreak 2013-2015, outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo 2018-2020), poliomyelitis (2014 to present), Zika (2016) and COVID-19 (2020 to present). Poliomyelitis is the longest PHEIC. Zika was the first PHEIC for an arboviral disease. For several other emerging diseases a PHEIC was not declared despite the fact that the public health impact of the event was considered serious and associated with potential for international spread. RECOMMENDATIONS: The binary nature of a PHEIC declaration is often not helpful for events where a tiered or graded approach is needed. The strength of PHEIC declarations is the ability to rapidly mobilize international coordination, streamline funding and accelerate the advancement of the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics under emergency use authorization. The ultimate purpose of such declaration is to catalyse timely evidence-based action, to limit the public health and societal impacts of emerging and re-emerging disease risks while preventing unwarranted travel and trade restrictions.","Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Osman, Sarah",J. travel med,393,16

However, little is known about the COVID-19-ralated mental health status among workers. METHODS: The cross-sectional online survey with 123,768 workers was conducted from February 2, 2020 to February 7, 2020 on a mega-size labor-intensive factory in Shenzhen, China. Oral consent was obtained prior to the questionnaire survey. The information collected in the survey included demographic characteristics, psychological symptoms, COVID-19-related information, and demands for psychological education and interventions. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured by the Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale. Logistic regression models were performed to determine the association between related factors and mental health status. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms was 3.4% and 22.8%, respectively. The dominant epidemic-related factors were having confirmed cases in the community (odds ratio [OR], 2.75, 95% CI, 2.37-3.19) and having confirmed friends (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.69-3.52) for the increased risk of anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively. Nevertheless, major traditional risk factors such as general or poor health status and always drinking alcohol were still the dominant factors associated with the increased risk of anxiety and depression symptoms. Overall, 67.3% and 26.8% workers reported desire for psychological education and interventions, respectively. LIMITATIONS: All assessments were self-reported, resulting in a risk of method bias. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a relatively low prevalence of anxiety symptoms, a relatively high prevalence of depression symptoms, and urgent demand for psychological education and interventions among workers during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Zhang, Xi-Ru; Huang, Qing-Mei; Wang, Xiao-Meng; Cheng, Xin; Li, Zhi-Hao; Wang, Zheng-He; Zhong, Wen-Fang; Liu, Dan; Shen, Dong; Chen, Pei-Liang; Song, Wei-Qi; Wu, Xian-Bo; Yang, Xingfen; Mao, Chen",J Affect Disord,393,20

To protect the healthcare workers at the front line from the outbreak of COVID − 19, it is necessary to understand the transmission dynamics of the virus, which has been shown to depend on indoor airflow patterns. In hospital operating rooms (ORs), design requirements pose a unique challenge as the positive pressure in the OR can facilitate virus spread into adjacent spaces, shall a COVID-positive patient require a surgical procedure. Moreover, the turbulent vortexes from door motions could independently increase the probability of virus escape from the OR to the adjacent corridors. Therefore, to obtain critical knowledge about the alteration of flow fields due to door movement in a positively pressurized room and quantify the air mixing across the door, a series of experiments were conducted in a controlled chamber. The results demonstrate significant impacts of the door opening on the airflow patterns. Increased alterations near the door and vortexes penetrating far into the chamber with multiple doors openings warrant further study of the indoor airflow dynamic under door motion. This experimental study proposes an algorithm to quantify the air exchange due to a standard door opening and quantifies this exfiltration of contaminated air up to 2 air changes per hour, that is 10% of the OR supply airflow rate. The algorithm to quantify the dissipated air quantity and the analyses of interaction between initial conditions and door openings contribute to the originality of this paper.","Bhattacharya, Arup Ghahramani Ali Mousavi Ehsan",Journal of Building Engineering,393,16

This might cause problems such as overwhelming tertiary facilities with mild condition patients, thus limiting their capacity of treating acute and critical patients. To address such maldistributed patient volume, it is essential to oversee patients choices before further evaluation of a policy or resource allocation. This study used nationwide insurance data, accumulated possible features discussed in existing literature, and used a deep neural network to predict the patients choices of hospital levels. This study also used explainable artificial intelligence methods to interpret the contribution of features for the general public and individuals. In addition, we explored the effectiveness of changing data representations. The results showed that the model was able to predict with high area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) (0.90), accuracy (0.90), sensitivity (0.94), and specificity (0.97) with highly imbalanced label. Generally, social approval of the provider by the general public (positive or negative) and the number of practicing physicians serving per ten thousand people of the located area are listed as the top effecting features. The changing data representation had a positive effect on the prediction improvement. Deep learning methods can process highly imbalanced data and achieve high accuracy. The effecting features affect the general public and individuals differently. Addressing the sparsity and discrete nature of insurance data leads to better prediction. Applications using deep learning technology are promising in health policy making. More work is required to interpret models and practice implementation.","Chen, Lichin; Tsao, Yu; Sheu, Ji-Tian",,393,32

Surveying our center's heart failure (HF) clinic population, we aimed to understand our patients' perception of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and care delivery preferences. Methods: Patients with chronic HF presenting either in-person or virtually were approached to complete a ten question, anonymous, voluntary survey. Acutely decompensated patients and heart transplant recipients were excluded. Results: 109 patients completed the survey. Average age was 62 ± 14 years, 67% were male, and 59% had HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Overall, patients were worried about contracting COVID-19 and believed they were prone to more severe infection given their underlying HF. However, they were not hesitant to initiate healthcare contact for symptoms and preferred in-person appointments over virtual visits. Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, female patients and those with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) were more concerned. Conclusions: Patients with HF are concerned about their increased risk of contracting COVID-19. However, they are actively seeking healthcare contact and prefer in-person over virtual visits.","Fraser, Meg; Mutschler, Melinda; Newman, Christie; Sackman, Kerry; Mehdi, Batul; Wick, Linda; Duval, Sue; Francis, Gary S; Alexy, Tamas",,393,30

Increased glycolysis in RA FLSs contributes to persistent joint damage. SUMOylation, a posttranslational modification of proteins, plays an important role in initiation and development of many diseases. However, the role of small ubiquitin-like modifier-activating (SUMO-activating) enzyme 1 (SAE1)/ubiquitin like modifier activating enzyme 2 (UBA2) in regulating the pathogenic FLS behaviors is unknown. Here, we found an increased expression of SAE1 and UBA2 in FLSs and synovial tissues from patients with RA. SAE1 or UBA2 knockdown by siRNA and treatment with GA, an inhibitor of SAE1/UBA2-mediated SUMOylation, resulted in reduced glycolysis, aggressive phenotype, and inflammation. SAE1/UBA2-mediated SUMOylation of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) promoted its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation and decreased PK activity. Moreover, inhibition of PKM2 phosphorylation increased PK activity and suppressed glycolysis, aggressive phenotype, and inflammation. We further demonstrated that STAT5A mediated SUMOylated PKM2-induced glycolysis and biological behaviors. Interestingly, GA treatment attenuated the severity of arthritis in mice with collagen-induced arthritis and human TNF-&#945; transgenic mice. These findings suggest that an increase in synovial SAE1/UBA2 may contribute to synovial glycolysis and joint inflammation in RA and that targeting SAE1/UBA2 may have therapeutic potential in patients with RA.","Wang, Cuicui; Xiao, Youjun; Lao, Minxi; Wang, Jingnan; Xu, Siqi; Li, Ruiru; Xu, Xuanxian; Kuang, Yu; Shi, Maohua; Zou, Yaoyao; Wang, Qingwen; Liang, Liuqin; Zheng, Song Guo; Xu, Hanshi",JCI insight,393,1

Still the information about COVID-19 infection and children affected by cancer are few. AIM: This survey aims to highlight preventive and control measures to manage COVID-19 infection in Italian Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Association (AIEOP) centers. METHODS: A multicenter, descriptive survey design was used. All the AIEOP centers were invited to complete an on-line survey. Data collection was performed between March 15, 2020 and April 15, 2020. RESULTS: Thirty six out of 48 centers responded to the survey. All the centers implemented similar preventive measures in order to control the COVID-19 spread and 77.8% of centers have created structured pathways, specific protocols or procedures; 30% of centers reduced the number of inpatient beds and 90% outpatient activity. The prevalence data collected report 14 children positive and 35 healthcare professionals positive. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 is not spreading homogeneously in Italy and children are less infected. It will be necessary to define new processes and new strategies to ensure safety and continuity of care to children affected by cancer, even in the future, when the lockdown will end, and new measures will be implemented.","Amicucci, Matteo; Canesi, Marta; Rostagno, Elena; Bergadano, Anna; Badino, Clara; Botta, Debora; Fenicia, Diana; Longo, Antonella; Macchi, Simone; Ricciardi, Celeste; Crotti Partel, Moreno",Prof Inferm,393,1

MethodsWe tested three SARS-CoV-2 antibody-detection assays (cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, and STANDARD Q COVID-19 IgM/IgG Combo Rapid Test) among 559 pre-COVID-19 sera. ResultsThe specificity of assays was 95-98% overall. However, lower specificity was observed among sera from patients with protozoan infections of the reticuloendothelial system, such as human African trypanosomiasis (Abbott Architect; 88% [95%CI 75-95]), visceral leishmaniasis (SD RDT IgG; 80% [95%CI 30-99]), and from patients with recent malaria from a holoendemic area of Senegal (ranging from 91% for Abbott Architect and SD RDT IgM to 98-99% for cPass and SD RDT IgG). For specimens from patients with evidence of past or present helminth infection overall, test specificity estimates were all [≥] 96%. Sera collected from patients clinically suspected of parasitic infections that tested negative for these infections yielded a specificity of 98-100%. The majority (>85%) of false-positive results were positive by only one assay. ConclusionsThe specificity of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays among sera from patients with tissue-borne parasitic infections was below the threshold required for decisions about individual patient care. Specificity is markedly increased by the use of confirmatory testing with a second assay. Finally, the SD RDT IgG proved similarly specific to laboratory-based assays and provides an option in low-resource settings when detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG is indicated.","Yansouni, Cedric P; Papenburg, Jesse; Cheng, Matthew P; Corsini, Rachel; Caya, Chelsea; Camargo, Fabio Vasquez; Harrison, Luke B; Zaharatos, Gerasimos; Buscher, Philippe; Faye, Babacar; Ndiaye, Magatte; Matlashewski, Greg; Ndao, Momar",,393,24

O objetivo do estudo foi analisar o excesso na mortalidade geral, segundo Semanas Epidemiológicas (SE), visando a identificar mudanças potencialmente associadas à epidemia em Manaus. Dados de mortalidade geral e grupos de causas foram obtidos na Central de Informações do Registro Civil Nacional e no Sistema de Informações sobre Mortalidade, para 2018, 2019 e 2020. Analisou-se faixa etária, sexo, local de ocorrência do óbito, SE, ano-calendário e causas de morte. Calcularam-se razões entre as mortes ocorridas em 2019/2018 e 2020/2019 para avaliar o excesso de mortes, com intervalos de confiança no nível de 5%. Não observou-se excesso de mortalidade geral significativo nas razões 2019/2018, independentemente da SE. Já as razões de 2020/2019 passaram de 1,0 (IC95%: 0,9-1,3) na SE 12 para 4,6 (IC95%: 3,9-5,3) na SE 17. Observou-se excesso de mortalidade geral com a progressão da idade, especialmente em indivíduos com 60 anos e mais, os quais concentraram 69,1% (IC95%: 66,8-71,4) das mortes. A razão 2020/2019 para óbitos em domicílio/via pública foi de 1,1 (IC95%: 0,7-1,8) na SE 12 e de 7,8 (IC95%: 5,4-11,2) na SE 17. A explosão da mortalidade geral em Manaus e a elevada proporção de óbitos em domicílio/via pública expõe a gravidade da epidemia em contextos de grande desigualdade social e fraca efetividade de ações governamentais, em especial aquelas voltadas ao enfrentamento das desigualdades sociais e para a garantia e fortalecimento do Sistema Único de Saúde.","Orellana, Jesem Douglas Yamall; Cunha, Geraldo Marcelo da; Marrero, Lihsieh; Horta, Bernardo Lessa; Leite, Iuri da Costa",Cad.

(2) Methods: Data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) collected from 2009 to 2015 were used. Osteoporosis (n = 19,351) and control (n = 38,702) participants were matched in a 1:2 ratio according to age, sex, income, and region of residence. PA was classified as moderate- to high-intensity PA (MHPA) or low-intensity PA (LPA) based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). SD was classified as short (&#8804;6 h) or long (>6 h). Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of MHPA and long SD for the occurrence of osteoporosis. Subgroup analyses were performed according to SD (or PA), obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. (3) The adjusted OR of MHPA for osteoporosis was 0.90 (95% CI = 0.87-0.94). The results were consistent in the age/sex, SD, obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption subgroups, but not the <60-year-old male and underweight subgroups. The adjusted OR of long SD for osteoporosis was 0.96 (95% CI = 0.93-1.00). The findings were consistent in the <60-year-old female, obese, nonsmoker, and <1 time a week alcohol consumption subgroups. (4) Conclusions: We suggest that both higher intensity of PA and long SD could decrease the risk of osteoporosis. Specifically, PA could decrease the risk of osteoporosis in individuals with most characteristics except male sex or underweight. Long SD could decrease the risk of osteoporosis in young females, obese individuals, nonsmokers, and individuals with lower alcohol consumption.","Min, Chan-Yang; Yoo, Dae-Myoung; Choi, Hyo-Geun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),393,16

The impetus of this article is to show that immunosenescence is a risk factor to COVID-19 and not aging per se. Based on the idea that some older people are also healthier than younger ones, the emphasis of this article is on immunosenescence and not aging as a risk factor of COVID-19 complications. The paper utilizes a biopsychosocial approach to expound on the link between immunosenescence and COVID-19 risk factors. The article explores biological factors such as malnutrition, comorbidities, substance abuse, and sex. It also expands on psychosocial factors such as mental health disorders, homelessness, unemployment, lack of physical exercises, stigma, and discrimination. The article calls for gerontological social work to assume a developmental-clinical social work perspective to prevent the early onset and progression of immunosenescence. It calls for gerontological social work to prevent factors that promote unhealthy aging. The article promotes a preventative stance to practice and not just curative approaches. Treatment involves primary prevention which emphasizes on avoiding the onset of unhealthy aging.

Existing female-specific literature highlights breast asymmetry and cosmetic reconstruction. We sought to evaluate gender differences in cardiopulmonary function. METHODS: Cardiac MRIs, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) were reviewed in 345 patients undergoing preoperative evaluation for PE. Regression modeling was used to evaluate associations between gender and clinical endpoints of cardiopulmonary function. RESULTS: Mean age was 15.2 years, 19% were female, 98% were white. Pectus indices included median Haller Index (HI) of 4.8, mean depression index (DI) of 0.63, correction index (CI) of 33.6%, and Cardiac Compression Index (CCI) of 2.79. Cardiac assessment revealed decreased right and left ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF, LVEF) in 16% and 22% of patients, respectively. PFTs and CPETs were abnormal in ~ 30% of patients. While females had deeper PE deformities-represented by higher pectus indices-they had superior function with higher RVEF, LVEF Z-scores, FEV1, VO2 max, O2 pulse, work, and breathing reserve (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Despite worse PE deformity and symptomatology, females had a better cardiopulmonary function and exercise tolerance than males.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether an association exists between the recently reported ZigZag pattern (FHR baseline amplitude changes of > 25 bpm with a duration of 2-30 min) and asphyxia-related neonatal outcomes in GDM pregnancies. METHODS: Intrapartal CTGs were recorded in a one-year cohort of 5150 singleton childbirths. The following CTG changes were evaluated: ZigZag pattern, saltatory pattern, late decelerations, episodes of tachycardia and bradycardia, reduced variability, and uterine tachysystole. The cohort was divided into three groups: women with GDM, women with normal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and women with no OGTT performed. Umbilical artery (UA) blood gases, Apgar scores, neonatal respiratory distress, and neonatal encephalopathy were used as outcome variables. RESULTS: GDM was diagnosed in 624 (12.1%), OGTT was normal in 4115 (79.9%), and OGTT was not performed in 411 (8.0%) women. Hypoxia-related ZigZag patterns (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.64-2.34) and late decelerations (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.27-2.13) of FHR, as well as a greater risk of fetal asphyxia (UA pH < 7.10 and/or UA BE < -12.0 meq/L and/or Apgar scores < 7 at 5-min) (OR 6.64, 95% CI 1.84-12.03) were observed in those with GDM compared with those without GDM. CONCLUSIONS: GDM is associated with intrapartal ZigZag pattern and late decelerations, cord blood acidemia and low 5-min Apgar scores at birth indicating increased occurrence of fetal hypoxia in GDM pregnancies.","Tarvonen, Mikko; Hovi, Petteri; Sainio, Susanna; Vuorela, Piia; Andersson, Sture; Teramo, Kari",Acta diabetol,393,1

In this report, we describe 3 clusters of COVID-19 infections among healthcare workers (HCWs), not associated with patient exposure, and the interventions undertaken to halt ongoing exposure and transmission at our cancer center. METHODS: A cluster of cases was defined as 2 or more cases of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive COVID-19 among HCWs who work in the same unit area at the same time. Cases were identified by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. Contact tracing, facility observations, and infection prevention assessments were performed to investigate the 3 clusters between March 1 and April 30, 2020, with subsequent implementation of containment strategies. RESULTS: The initial cluster involved HCWs from an ancillary services unit, with contacts traced back to a gathering in a break room in which 1 employee was symptomatic, although not yet diagnosed with COVID-19, with subsequent transmission to 7 employees. The second cluster involved 4 employees and was community related. The third cluster involved only 2 employees with possible transmission while working in the same office at the same time. A step-up approach was implemented to control the spread of infection among employees, including universal masking, enhanced cleaning, increase awareness, and surveillance testing. No nosocomial transmission to patients transpired. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a hospital-based cluster of COVID-19 infections among HCWs in a cancer hospital describing our steps to mitigate further transmission.","Ariza-Heredia, Ella J; Frenzel, Elizabeth; Cantu, Sherry; Carlson, Mary; Thomas, Georgia; Khawaja, Fareed; Raad, Issam I; Chemaly, Roy F",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,393,20

RESULTS: Corrections were made in 71 (38%) cases from first batch [26 (37%) oversegmentations and 45 (63%) undersegmentations] and in 77 (48%) cases from second batch [12 (16%) oversegmentations and 65 (84%) undersegmentations]. DSC, JC, false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) [mean (SD)] in first versus second batches were 0.63 (0.15) versus 0.63 (0.16), 0.48 (0.15) versus 0.48 (0.15), 0.29 (0.21) versus 0.21 (0.10), and 0.36 (0.20) versus 0.43 (0.19), respectively. Differences were not significant (p > 0.05). However, range of mean pancreatic volume difference reduced in the second batch [- 2.74 cc (min - 92.96 cc, max 87.47 cc) versus - 23.57 cc (min - 77.32, max 30.19)]. CONCLUSION: Trained technologists could perform volumetric pancreas segmentation with reasonable accuracy despite its complexity. Supplementary training further reduced range of volume difference in segmentations. Investment into training technologists could augment and accelerate development of body imaging datasets for AI applications.","Suman, Garima; Panda, Ananya; Korfiatis, Panagiotis; Edwards, Marie E; Garg, Sushil; Blezek, Daniel J; Chari, Suresh T; Goenka, Ajit H",Abdom. radiology (Internet),393,24

There are few such studies, particularly from low or middle-income countries. Brazil is currently a hotspot for COVID-19 globally. We aimed to investigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody prevalence by city and according to sex, age, ethnicity group, and socioeconomic status, and compare seroprevalence estimates with official statistics on deaths and cases. METHODS: In this repeated cross-sectional study, we did two seroprevalence surveys in 133 sentinel cities in all Brazilian states. We randomly selected households and randomly selected one individual from all household members. We excluded children younger than 1 year. Presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using a lateral flow point-of-care test, the WONDFO SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test (Wondfo Biotech, Guangzhou, China), using two drops of blood from finger prick samples. This lateral-flow assay detects IgG and IgM isotypes that are specific to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Participants also answered short questionnaires on sociodemographic information (sex, age, education, ethnicity, household size, and household assets) and compliance with physical distancing measures. FINDINGS: We included 25â025 participants in the first survey (May 14-21) and 31â165 in the second (June 4-7). For the 83 (62%) cities with sample sizes of more than 200 participants in both surveys, the pooled seroprevalence increased from 1·9% (95% CI 1·7-2·1) to 3·1% (2·8-3·4). City-level prevalence ranged from 0% to 25·4% in both surveys. 11 (69%) of 16 cities with prevalence above 2·0% in the first survey were located in a stretch along a 2000 km of the Amazon river in the northern region. In the second survey, we found 34 cities with prevalence above 2·0%, which included the same 11 Amazon cities plus 14 from the northeast region, where prevalence was increasing rapidly. Prevalence levels were lower in the south and centre-west, and intermediate in the southeast, where the highest level was found in Rio de Janeiro (7·5% [4·2-12·2]). In the second survey, prevalence was similar in men and women, but an increased prevalence was observed in participants aged 20-59 years and those living in crowded conditions (4·4% [3·5-5·6] for those living with households with six or more people). Prevalence among Indigenous people was 6·4% (4·1-9·4) compared with 1·4% (1·2-1·7) among White people. Prevalence in the poorest socioeconomic quintile was 3·7% (3·2-4·3) compared with 1·7% (1·4-2·2) in the wealthiest quintile. INTERPRETATION: Antibody prevalence was highly heterogeneous by country region, with rapid initial escalation in Brazil's north and northeast. Prevalence is strongly associated with Indigenous ancestry and low socioeconomic status. These population subgroups are unlikely to be protected if the policy response to the pandemic by the national government continues to downplay scientific evidence.

Methods A structured questionnaire was used to conduct a questionnaire survey of the research subjects through an online platform. The public mental health status was assessed using the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90). Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze related influencing factors. Results The survey included 1 078 eligible questionnaires, of which 252 (23.38%) were positive on the SCL-90 scale. For each SCL-90 factor, the highest positive rate was anxiety (41.28%), followed by horror (35.16%), and depression (33.21%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that from Hubei (OR=1.64, P=0.014), male (OR=1.37, P=0.036), medical related occupations or professions (OR=1.57, P=0.008), and high concern over the epidemic (OR=2.19, P=0.013) and known people with suspected or confirmed cases (OR=2.75, P<0.001) were risk factors influencing public mental health. Conclusion The mental health problems of the population during the epidemic of COVID-19 were serious, especially in Hubei. Male groups, medical workers, and people with relatives and friends who have a case need to pay attention to their own mental health. The government should increase the publicity of mental health knowledge to effectively prevent the occurrence and development of mental illness in these people.","SONG, Feifei; WANG, Xin; Zhiying, JU; LIU, Aixiang; LIU, Junjie; WANG, Tao",Journal of Public Health and Preventive Medicine,393,21

Methods National surveillance data on adults (aged ≥ 15 years) with diagnosed HIV resident in England were linked to national COVID-19 mortality surveillance data (2 March 2020?16 June 2020);HIV clinicians verified linked cases and provided information on the circumstances of death. We present COVID-19 mortality rates by HIV status, using negative binomial regression to assess the association between HIV and mortality, adjusting for gender, age and ethnicity. Results Overall, 99 people with HIV, including 61 of black ethnicity, died of/with COVID-19 (107/100 000) compared with 49 483 people without HIV (109/100 000). Compared to people without HIV, higher COVID-19 mortality rates were observed in people with HIV of black (188 vs. 122/100 000) and Asian (131 vs. 77.0/100 000) ethnicity, and in both younger (15?59 years: 58.3 vs. 10.2/100 000) and older (≥ 60 years: 434 vs. 355/100 000) people. After adjustment for demographic factors, people with HIV had a higher COVID-19 mortality risk than those without (2.18;95% CI: 1.76?2.70). Most people with HIV who died of/with COVID-19 had suppressed HIV viraemia (91%) and at least one comorbidity reported to be associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes (87%). Conclusions In the first wave of the pandemic in England, COVID-19 mortality among people with HIV was low, but was higher than in those without HIV, after controlling for demographic factors. This supports the strategy of prioritizing COVID-19 vaccination for people with HIV and strongly encouraging its uptake, especially in those of black and Asian ethnicity.","Brown, Alison E.; Croxford, Sara E.; Nash, Sophie Khawam Jameel Kirwan Peter Kall Meaghan Bradshaw Daniel Sabin Caroline Miller Robert F.; Post, Frank A.; Harding, Richard Collins Simon Waters Laura Asboe David Chadwick David R.; Delpech, Valerie Sullivan Ann K.",HIV Medicine,393,16

Comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases have been the most common risk factors for severity and mortality. The hyperinflammatory response of the body, coupled with the plausible direct effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome on body-wide organs via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, has been associated with complications of the disease. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, renal failure, liver damage, shock, and multiorgan failure have precipitated death. Acknowledging the comorbidities and potential organ injuries throughout the course of COVID-19 is therefore crucial in the clinical management of patients.

Results indicated that anger and anxiety significantly predicted perceived influence of misinformation on others; presumed influence on others positively affected public support in corrective and restrictive actions in both U.S. and China. Further, anger toward misinformation led to public willingness to self-correct in the U.S. and China.

We sought to understand if: a) demographic variables of Cameroonian residents could influence KAP and symptomatology, and b) KAP could influence the risk of having COVID19.A cross-sectional KAP/symptomatology online survey was conducted between April 20 to May 20. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 23. Of all respondents (1006), 53.1% were female, 26.6% were students, 26.9% interacted face to face and 62.8% were residents in Yaoundé with a median age of 33. The overall high score was 84.19% for knowledge, 69% for attitude, and 60.8% for practice towards COVID 19. Age > 20 years was associated with a high knowledge of COVID 19.

I discuss the loss of the live experience alongside the absence of my colleagues due to the transition to remote working. I touch on Freud’s paper ‘Mourning and melancholia’ and consider how losing the physical presence of patients and colleagues in time led to what the American psychologist Freudenberger termed‘ burn-out.’ I discuss Freudenberger’s concept and propose that although we did show signs and symptoms of burn-out it never became a chronic condition but was episodic in nature. I suggest that we have been living through a time when we have been confronted by personal and collective anxieties about death and dying. I touch on the idea of ‘resilience’ and my observation that it is founded on interdependence. I also suggest that we can be helped by our training, analysis and supervision and need to use these in conscious ways in order to look out for ourselves at a time when there are very real external fears and anxieties. © 2021 Association of Child Psychotherapists.","Webster, C.",Journal of Child Psychotherapy,393,29

ObjectiveIn this study, we aimed to monitor mental health concerns on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom (UK), and assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health concerns of Twitter users. MethodsWe collected COVID-19 and mental health-related tweets from the UK between March 5, 2020 and January 31, 2021 through the Twitter Streaming API. We conducted topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to examine discussions about mental health concerns. Deep learning algorithms including Face++ were used to infer the demographic characteristics (age and gender) of Twitter users who expressed mental health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. ResultsWe showed a positive correlation between COVID-19-related mental health concerns on Twitter and the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Geographic analysis showed that populated urban areas have a higher proportion of Twitter users with mental health concerns compared to England as a whole. Topic modeling showed that general concerns, COVID-19 skeptics, and Death toll were the top topics discussed in mental health-related tweets. Demographic analysis showed that middle-aged and older adults might be more likely to suffer from mental health issues or express their mental health concerns on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic. ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has noticeable effects on mental health concerns on Twitter in the UK, which varied among demographic and geographic groups.","Zhang, Daiwei; Liu, Yue; Zhang, Senqi; Sun, Li; Li, Pin; Anand, Ajay; Xie, Zidian; Li, Dongmei",,393,26

Here, we report a comprehensive computational approach to identify the multi-targeted drug molecules against the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whichare crucially involved in the viral-host interaction, replication of the virus inside the host, disease progression and transmission of coronavirus infection. Virtual screening of 75 FDA-approved potential antiviral drugs against the target proteins, spike (S) glycoprotein, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), cathepsin L (CTSL), nucleocapsid protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and non-structural protein 6 (NSP6), resulted in the selection of seven drugs which preferentially bind to the target proteins. Further, the molecular interactions determined by molecular dynamics simulation revealed that among the 75 drug molecules, catechin can effectively bind to 3CLpro, CTSL, RBD of S protein, NSP6 and nucleocapsid protein. It is more conveniently involved in key molecular interactions, showing binding free energy (&#916;Gbind) in the range of -5.09 kcal/mol (CTSL) to -26.09 kcal/mol (NSP6). At the binding pocket, catechin is majorly stabilized by the hydrophobic interactions, displays &#916;EvdW values: -7.59 to -37.39 kcal/mol. Thus, the structural insights of better binding affinity and favorable molecular interaction of catechin toward multiple target proteins signify that catechin can be potentially explored as a multi-targeted agent against COVID-19.","Mishra, Chandra Bhushan; Pandey, Preeti; Sharma, Ravi Datta; Malik, Md Zubbair; Mongre, Raj Kumar; Lynn, Andrew M; Prasad, Rajendra; Jeon, Raok; Prakash, Amresh",Brief. bioinform,393,20

The pandemic not only has catastrophic impacts on physical health and economy around the world, but also the psychological well-being of individuals, communities and society. The psychological and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic internationally have not been well described. There is a lack of international study assessing health-related impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially on the degree to which individuals are fearful of the pandemic. Therefore, this study aims to (1) assess the health-related impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in community-dwelling individuals around the world; (2) determine the extent various communities are fearful of COVID-19 and (3) identify perceived needs of the population to prepare for potential future pandemics. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This global study involves 30 countries. For each country, we target at least 500 subjects aged 18 years or above. The questionnaires will be available online and in local languages. The questionnaires include assessment of the health impacts of COVID-19, perceived importance of future preparation for the pandemic, fear, lifestyles, sociodemographics, COVID-19-related knowledge, e-health literacy, out-of-control scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe participants' characteristics, perceptions on the health-related impacts of COVID-19, fear, anxiety and depression, lifestyles, COVID-19 knowledge, e-health literacy and other measures. Univariable and multivariable regression models will be used to assess the associations of covariates on the outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been reviewed and approved by the local ethics committees in participating countries, where local ethics approval is needed. The results will be actively disseminated.

In doing so, the X77-mimetic candidates were predicted based on the crystal X77-MPro structure by a public web-oriented virtual screening platform Pharmit. Models of these candidates bound to SARS-COV-2 MPro were generated by molecular docking, quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. At the final point, analysis of the interaction modes of the identified compounds with MPro and prediction of their binding affinity were carried out. Calculation revealed 5 top-ranking compounds that exhibited a high affinity to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 MPro. Insights into the ligand - MPro models indicate that all identified compounds may effectively block the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 MPro, in line with the low values ââof binding free energy and dissociation constant. Mechanism of binding of these compounds to MPro is mainly provided by van der Waals interactions with the functionally important residues of the enzyme, such as His-41, Met-49, Cys-145, Met-165, and Gln-189 that play a role of the binding hot spots assisting the predicted molecules to effectively interact with the MPro active site. The data obtained show that the identified X77-mimetic candidates may serve as good scaffolds for the design of novel antiviral agents able to target the active site of SARS-CoV-2 MPro.

Transmission-based precautions to protect residents, employees, and families alike must account for potential risks posed by LTC workers' second jobs and unpaid care work. This observational study describes the prevalence of their (1) second jobs, and (2) unpaid care work for dependent children and/or adult relatives (double- and triple-duty caregiving) overall and by occupational group (registered nurses [RNs], licensed practical nurses [LPNs], or certified nursing assistants [CNAs]). DESIGN: A descriptive secondary analysis of data collected as part of the final wave of the Work, Family and Health Study. SETTING: Thirty nursing home facilities located throughout the northeastern United States. PARTICIPANTS: A subset of 958 essential facility-based LTC workers involved in direct patient care. MEASUREMENTS: We present information on LTC workers' demographic characteristics, health, features of their LTC occupation, additional paid work, wages, and double- or triple-duty caregiving roles. RESULTS: Most LTC workers were CNAs, followed by LPNs and RNs. Overall, more than 70% of these workers agreed or strongly agreed with this statement: ""When you are sick, you still feel obligated to come into work."" One-sixth had a second job, where they worked an average of 20 hours per week, and more than 60% held double- or triple-duty caregiving roles. Additional paid work and unpaid care work characteristics did not significantly differ by occupational group, although the prevalence of second jobs was highest and accompanying work hours were longest among CNAs. CONCLUSION: LTC workers commonly hold second jobs along with double- and triple-duty caregiving roles. To slow the spread of COVID-19, both the paid and unpaid activities of these employees warrant consideration in the identification of appropriate clinical, policy, and informal supports.

COVID-19 is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of the study is to contribute to the surveillance of the pandemic by bringing new knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers. It seeks to evaluate whether certain job functions are associated with a higher risk of being infected and to clarify if such association is mediated by the number of individuals that employees meet during a workday. In addition, we investigate regional and national differences in seroprevalence. METHODS: This research involved a bi-national prospective observational cohort study including 3272 adults employed at Falck in Sweden and Denmark. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies every second week for a period of 8 weeks from 22 June 2020 until 10 August 2020. Descriptive statistics as well as multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: Of the 3272 Falck employees participating in this study, 159 (4.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was lower among Danish Falck employees than among those from Sweden (2.8% in Denmark and 8.3% in Sweden). We also found that the number of customer or patient contacts during a workday was the most prominent predictor for seropositivity and that ambulance staff was the most vulnerable staff group. CONCLUSION: Our study presents geographical variations in seroprevalence within the Falck organization and shows evidence that social interaction is one of the biggest risk factors for becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Laursen, Jannie; Petersen, Janne; Didriksen, Maria; Iversen, Kasper; Ullum, Henrik",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),393,20

We have earlier introduced highly effective antiviral siRNA swarms against herpes simplex virus (HSV), targeting 653 bp of the essential UL29 viral gene. Here, we report a method for enzymatic production and antiviral use of 2'-fluoro-modified siRNA swarms. Utilizing the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from bacteriophage phi6, we produced 2'-F-siRNA swarms containing either all or a fraction of modified adenosine, cytidine or uridine residues in the antisense strand of the UL29 target. The siRNA containing modified pyrimidines demonstrated high resistance to RNase A and the antiviral potency of all the UL29-specific 2'-F-siRNA swarms was 100-fold in comparison with the unmodified counterpart, without additional cytotoxicity. Modest stimulation of innate immunity signaling, including induced expression of both type I and type III interferons, as well as interferon-stimulated gene 54, by 2'-F-cytidine and 2'-F-uridine modified siRNA swarms occurred at early time points after transfection while the 2'-F-adenosine-containing siRNA was similar to the unmodified antiviral siRNA swarm in this respect. The antiviral efficacy of the 2'-F-siRNA swarms and the elicited cellular innate responses did not correlate suggesting that innate immunity pathways do not significantly contribute to the observed enhanced antiviral activity of the modified siRNAs. The results support further applications of enzymatically produced siRNA molecules with incorporated adenosine nucleotides, carrying fluoro-modification on ribose C2' position, for further antiviral studies in vitro and in vivo.","Levanova, Alesia A; Kalke, Kiira M; Lund, Liisa M; Sipari, Nina; Sadeghi, Mohammadreza; Nyman, Marie C; Paavilainen, Henrik; Hukkanen, Veijo; Poranen, Minna M",Antiviral Res,393,20

In these systems, we use multivariate marked Hawkes point processes to describe the event arrivals. Under mild assumptions we prove the weak convergence of their rescaled density processes to a multi-type continuous-state branching process with immigration (CBI-process). In addition, we also provide two scaling limits for their shot noise processes with limits being functionals of the multi-type CBI-process. Finally, we provide a Hawkes representation for Crump-Mode-Jagers branching processes and apply our limit results to study their asymptotic behavior. Specially, we observe an interesting phenomenon, known as state space collapse in queueing theory, in the population structure described by two measure-valued processes: age-distribution process and residual-life distribution process. Indeed, under a convergence condition on the life-length distributions, both the two rescaled measure-valued processes converge weakly to a common measure-valued diffusion process, which can be characterized as a lifting map of a multi-type CBI-process associated with the limit excess life-length distribution.","Xu, Wei",,393,24

We aimed to understand migrant worker concerns and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic to address these during the crisis and inform on comprehensive support needed after the crisis. METHODS: In-depth semi-structured interviews were carried out with migrant workers diagnosed with COVID-19. The participants were recruited from a COVID-19 mass quarantine facility in Singapore through a purposive sampling approach. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis performed to derive themes in their collective experience during the crisis. RESULTS: Three theme categories were derived from 27 interviews: migrant worker concerns during COVID-19, coping during COVID-19 and priorities after COVID-19. Major stressors in the crisis included the inability to continue providing for their families when work is disrupted, their susceptibility to infection in crowded dormitories, the shock of receiving the COVID-19 diagnosis while asymptomatic, as well as the isolating conditions of the quarantine environment. The workers coped by keeping in contact with their families, accessing healthcare, keeping updated with the news and continuing to practise their faith and religion. They looked forward to a return to normalcy after the crisis with keeping healthy and having access to healthcare as new priorities. CONCLUSION: We identified coping strategies employed by the workers in quarantine, many of which were made possible through the considered design of care and service delivery in mass quarantine facilities in Singapore. These can be adopted in the set-up of other mass quarantine facilities around the world to support the health and mental well-being of those quarantined. Our findings highlight the importance of targeted policy intervention for migrant workers, in areas such as housing and working environments, equitable access to healthcare, and social protection during and after this crisis.","Yee, Kaisin; Peh, Hui Peng; Tan, Yee Pin; Teo, Irene; Tan, Emily U Tong; Paul, Justin; Rangabashyam, Mahalakshmi; Ramalingam, Mothi Babu; Chow, Weien; Tan, Hiang Khoon",BMJ Open,393,1

Several aspects of its pathogenesis and the related clinical consequences still need elucidation. In Italy, Sardinia has had very low numbers of infections. Taking advantage of the low genetic polymorphism in the Sardinian population, we analyzed clinical, genetic and immunogenetic factors, with particular attention to HLA class I and II molecules, to evaluate their influence on susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical outcome. Method and Materials: We recruited 619 healthy Sardinian controls and 182 SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thirty-nine patients required hospital care and 143 were without symptoms, pauci-symptomatic or with mild disease. For all participants, we collected demographic and clinical data and analyzed the HLA allele and haplotype frequencies. Results: Male sex and older age were more frequent in hospitalized patients, none of whom had been vaccinated during the previous seasonal flu vaccination campaignes. Compared to the group of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic patients, hospitalized patients also had a higher frequency of autoimmune diseases and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PDH) deficiency. None of these patients carried the beta-thalassemia trait, a relatively common finding in the Sardinian population. The extended haplotype HLA-A*02:05, B*58:01, C*07:01, DRB1*03:01 [OR 0.1 (95% CI 0-0.6), Pc = 0.015] was absent in all 182 patients, while the HLA-C*04:01 allele and the three-loci haplotype HLA-A*30:02, B*14:02, C*08:02 [OR 3.8 (95% CI 1.8-8.1), Pc = 0.025] were more frequently represented in patients than controls. In a comparison between in-patients and home care patients, the HLA-DRB1*08:01 allele was exclusively present in the hospitalized patients [OR > 2.5 (95% CI 2.7-220.6), Pc = 0.024]. Conclusion: The data emerging from our study suggest that the extended haplotype HLA-A*02:05, B*58:01, C*07:01, DRB1*03:01 has a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Sardinian population. Genetic factors that resulted to have a negative influence on the disease course were presence of the HLA-DRB1*08:01 allele and G6PDH deficiency, but not the beta-thalassemic trait. Absence of influenza vaccination could be a predisposing factor for more severe disease.","Littera, Roberto; Campagna, Marcello; Deidda, Silvia; Angioni, Goffredo; Cipri, Selene; Melis, Maurizio; Firinu, Davide; Santus, Simonetta; Lai, Alberto; Porcella, Rita; Lai, Sara; Rassu, Stefania; Scioscia, Rosetta; Meloni, Federico; Schirru, Daniele; Cordeddu, William; Kowalik, Marta Anna; Serra, Maria; Ragatzu, Paola; Carta, Mauro Giovanni; Del Giacco, Stefano; Restivo, Angelo; Deidda, Simona; Orrù, Sandro; Palimodde, Antonella; Perra, Roberto; Orrù, Germano; Conti, Maria; Balestrieri, Cinzia; Serra, Giancarlo; Onali, Simona; Marongiu, Francesco; Perra, Andrea; Chessa, Luchino",Front Immunol,393,20

METHODS: A prospective cohort study through a telephone survey was performed in 156 patients (143 for primary and 13 for revision) included in the TKR and RKR surgical waiting list before March 2020. Contact of each patient with COVID-19, stress and anxiety, perceived pain, and function were obtained in the interviews, and also the preference of each patient to have re-scheduled surgery (early or late). Finally, we registered their response (acceptance or refusal) when surgery was effectively re-scheduled. RESULTS: 88 out of 156 patients waiting for knee replacement (76/143 of those waiting for TKR, 12/13 of those waiting for RKR) declared themselves ready for surgery in less than 1 month. When re-scheduled, 115 patients underwent surgery and 41 refused. Significantly different preferences were found for age (more prone to surgery if under 65), revision surgery (more readily available), pain (7.9 ± 1.7/10 in NRS in those undergoing surgery, 5.6 ± 2.3/10 in those refusing, p = 0.000), or COVID-19 diagnosis, but not other close contact with COVID-19, comorbidities, stress, or anxiety. A logistic regression model confirmed that revision surgery (OR 9.33), perceived severe pain (OR 5.21), and age under 65 years (OR 5.82) were significantly associated with patient preference. The probability of patients over 65 to prefer early surgery reached 60% only with pain at or above 9/10. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical timing preferences for knee replacement vary between patients older than 65 years (immediate surgery only when pain is intense) and younger patients (immediate surgery no matter the amount of pain). Even if COVID-19 severely stroke our population, the need for knee replacement stood in the young population and even in the aged population at risk for COVID when pain was important.","Gómez-Barrena, Enrique; Rubio-Saez, Israel; Padilla-Eguiluz, Norma G; Hernandez-Esteban, Pablo",Knee surg. sports traumatol. arthrosc,393,16

This new law replaced the previous line item budgeting, with a new program-based budgeting (PBB) process. This study examined the experience of health sector PBB implementation at the county level in Kenya. METHODS: We carried out a systematic review of the literature documenting the health sector application and utility of PBB in low- and middle-income countries. We then collected empirical data to examine the experience of health sector application of PBB at County Level in Kenya. RESULTS: In the financial year 2017/18, counties utilised the PBB approach for health sector planning. The PBB approach was perceived by keys stakeholders; to have improved the alignment of technical priorities with budgetary allocation, and to have increased transparency, accountability and openness of the process. Its challenges included lack of clear tools and guidelines to support implementation, low capacity at county level, political interference and the organisation of the public sector electronic financial management system around line item budgeting system. CONCLUSION: PBB is potentially a useful tool for aligning health sector planning and budgeting and ensuring the Annual Work Plan is more result oriented. However, realisation of this goal would be enhanced by the developing clear tools and guidelines to support its implementation, building capacity for county health sector managers to better understand the PBB application, and reforming the public-sector budgetary management system to align it with the PBB approach.","Tsofa, Benjamin; Musotsi, Protus; Kagwanja, Nancy; Waithaka, Dennis; Molyneux, Sassy; Barasa, Edwine; Maina, Thomas; Chuma, Jane",Int. j. health plann. manage,393,20

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the survey answers of 701 Vietnamese respondents, this study explores the psychological impact associated with COVID-19 lockdown in Vietnam. Using a newly developed “mvord” package in R that controls the heterogeneity in error structure of the sample units (Hirk et al., 2020), the study runs multivariate ordinal logistic regression models to examine the determinants of the emotional outcomes. Findings: The study discloses negative psychological states among the Vietnamese community during and after the lockdown, including boredom, anxiety, sadness, stress, anger, precautionary measures and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Demographic characteristics (male gender, young age, poor-health condition, high educational level, small family size, officers or professionals, using public transport, quarantine experience before the lockdown, non-extended lockdown period and living in rural areas) and various difficulties during lockdown (insufficient information about COVID-19, income loss, having daily-life difficulties and unhappy experiences during lockdown) are related to higher degrees of different psychological symptoms during and after lockdown in Vietnam. Originality/value: This study identifies the importance of mitigating the detrimental effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on Vietnamese well-being and prepares the Vietnamese government better to handle the public mental issues during future lockdowns. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Gan, C.; Anh, D.

Diagnostic tests not only confirm past exposure but offer key information to guide patients' healthcare options Current diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 virus presence or antibodies lack evidence of longer-lasting cellular immunity, partly due to more complex cell culture-based techniques compared to serological tests. We aimed to (1) develop an in vitro flow cytometric diagnostic immunoassay and (2) determine if lasting memory helper CD4 and cytotoxic CD8 T cell activations are distinct between unexposed and convalescent individuals Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from whole blood of unexposed (n = 10) or convalescent (n = 30) individuals were cultured for 5 days with individual SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins or self-designed peptides including the spike, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. Specific activation of memory T cells and B cells against SARSCoV- 2 antigens were determined by the upregulation of activation markers (CD4 T cells: CD134+ CD137+;CD8 T cells: CD69+ CD137+;CD19 B cells: CD38+). We show both activated T cells and B cells are detectable against all tested antigens, and distinguishable between unexposed and convalescent individuals up to 11 months post-infection. Therefore, with this diagnostic tool, we propose that it would benefit immunocompromised individuals who are unable to mount sustained antibody responses and to study immune correlates of protection, thus enhancing knowledge of the Covid19 disease in a wider range of patient groups.","Thoo, L.; Gumowski, P.; Kammermann, K.; Hausmann, O.; Pichler, W.; Yerly, D.",Swiss Medical Weekly,393,13

Simultaneously, a series of wildlife sightings-mainly in urban areas-have been brought to public attention and often attributed to lockdown measures. Here we report on a series of wild carnivore records, including threatened species, obtained through camera traps set in urban forests, campuses, suburbs, and peri-urban areas of two cities in Chile, during partial lockdown measures. Our records are novel for Chile, a country where urban carnivore ecology is mostly unknown, and include the detection of four native carnivores, including the vulnerable güiña (Leopardus guigna) and the endangered southern river otter (Lontra provocax). These records also constitute a valuable baseline collected during partial lockdown measures in two cities of the Global South. We emphasize, however, that these findings cannot be used to argue for or against an effect of lockdown measures on wildlife. More generally, we call for caution in the interpretation of seemingly novel carnivore records during periods of lockdown and stress the value of international collaboration in evaluating the effects of the Anthropause on wildlife.","Silva-Rodríguez, Eduardo A; Gálvez, Nicolás; Swan, George J F; Cusack, Jeremy J; Moreira-Arce, Darío",Sci Total Environ,393,1

In his influential book published in 1971, Minimal Brain Dysfunction in Children, Wender3 reviewed historical accounts of the 1918 pandemic and suggested that viral infection had selective brain effects on catecholamine nuclei, and behavioral sequelae in some children emerged and overlapped with symptoms that now define attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and behavioral sequelae emerged in some adults that overlapped with symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Based on this and several excitotoxic models of behavioral disorders (ie, Volpe, Altman, Amsel, Benveniste, and Lou) related to arterial architecture and patterns of blood flow to the brain, previously our group4 proposed etiologic subtypes of ADHD based on a dopamine-deficit hypothesis and assumption that dopamine neurons might be particularly sensitive to a variety of environmental insults. We speculate that residual effects of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may selectively affect brain regions underlying attention and motivation deficits associated with ADHD, as documented by positron emission tomography imaging studies of adults (see Volkow et al.5), which could increase risk for an infection-triggered etiologic subtype of ADHD.","Swanson, James M; Volkow, Nora D",J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry,393,1

Methods: Consecutive subjects aged &#8805;12 years old who were screened for COVID-19 were included in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from January 23 to February 3, 2020, and the subjects were further divided into the inception cohort and the validation cohort. The gender, age, onset time of disease of the subjects were recorded. The information of epidemiological history, fever, and the declined blood lymphocytes were collected as clinical indicators, CT scan was used to evaluate the possibility of COVID-19 and range of lung involvement. According to the current Chinese national standards, throat swabs of suspected cases were collected and the nucleic acid of COVID-19 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The Xiangya pathway was constructed with multi-indexes, compared with clinical indicators, CT results and Chinese national standards, their effectiveness of detecting confirmed cases were verified in the inception and validation cohort. Results: A total of 382 consecutive adults who was screened for COVID-19 were included, and 261 cases were in the inception cohort and 121 cases were in the validation cohort. Among the 382 cases, 192 were males (50.3%) and 190 were females (49.7%), with a median age of 35 years (range: 15-92 years). There were 183 cases (47.9%) with epidemiological history, 275 cases (72.0%) with fever, 212 cases (55.5%) with decreased peripheral blood lymphocytes, 114 cases (29.8%) with positive CT findings, 43 cases (11.3%) with positive CT-COVID-19, and 30 cases (7.9%) with positive virus nucleic acid by throat swab. Compared with clinical indicators, the sensitivity and specificity of CT were 0.950 and 0.704, respectively. The accuracy of CT to make a definite diagnosis was higher than that of epidemiological history, fever, and declined blood lymphocyte count (0.809 vs 0.660, 0.532, 0.596, P=0.001, 0.002, 0.003, respectively). The sensitivity of this pathway and the pathway recommended by the Health Commission of China were both high (all were 1.000), while the specificity and accuracy of the Xiangya pathway were higher than the one recommended by the Health Commission (0.872 vs 0.765, 0.778 vs 0.592, both P<0.001). The CT-COVID-19 reduced the missed diagnosis rate caused by false negative of nucleic acid test (31 vs 64), with difference rate of 51.6%, and the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 64.5% (20/31). In validation cohort, the specificity and accuracy of the Xiangya pathway was 0.967, the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 76.9%(10/13). Conclusions: The Xiangya pathway can predict the nucleic acid test results of COVID-19, and can be applied as a reliable strategy to screen patients with suspected COVID-19 among people aged &#8805;12 years in areas other than Hubei during the epidemic period of COVID-19.

The current study aimed to investigate the role of fatalism and comparative optimism for adherence to COVID-19 protocols. We also tested whether these factors are directly associated with adherence or associated through attitudinal mediation. The results were based on a web survey conducted among university students (n = 370) in Tehran, Iran. The respondents completed a multidimensional measure of fatalism (general fatalism, internality, and luck) and measures of comparative optimism, attitudes toward COVID-19 health measures, and adherence. The estimated structural equation model explained approximately 40% of the total variance in attitudes toward COVID-19 protocols and adherence. As expected, high internality was associated with stronger adherence, whereas luck was associated with weaker adherence. Comparative optimism was more strongly associated with adherence than fatalism, and somewhat unexpectedly comparative optimism was associated with stronger adherence. Analyses of direct and indirect effects suggested that fatalism was mainly mediated through attitudes, whereas comparative optimism had both direct and mediated effects.

Here, we review the contributions of 4.8 million community-directed distributors (CDDs) of medicines over 2 decades in 146,000 communities in 27 sub-Saharan African countries to control or eliminate onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis (LF). We examine their role in the control of other NTDs, malaria, HIV/AIDS interventions, immunisation campaigns, and support to overstretched health service personnel. We are of the opinion that CDDs as community selected, trained, and experienced ""foot soldiers,"" some of whom were involved in the Ebola outbreak responses at the community level in Liberia, if retrained, can assist community leaders and support health workers (HWs) in the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis. The review highlights the improved treatment coverage where there are women CDDs, the benefits and lessons from the work of CDDs, their long-term engagement, and the challenges they face in healthcare delivery. It underscores the value of utilising the CDD model for strong community engagement and recommends the model, with some review, to hasten the achievement of the NTD 2030 goal and assist the health system cope with evolving epidemics and other challenges. We propose that, based on the unprecedented progress made in the control of NTDs directly linked to community engagement and contributions of CDDs ""foot soldiers,"" they deserve regional and global recognition. We also suggest that the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international stakeholders promote policy and guidance for countries to adapt this model for the elimination of NTDs and to strengthen national health services. This will enhance the accomplishment of some Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 in sub-Saharan Africa.","Amazigo, Uche V; Leak, Stephen G A; Zoure, Honorat G M; Okoronkwo, Chukwu; Diop Ly, Maimouna; Isiyaku, Sunday; Crump, Andy; Okeibunor, Joseph C; Boatin, Boakye",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,393,1

Identifying the epidemiological characteristics of this disease will help to make appropriate decisions and thus control the epidemic. The aim of this study was characterization of the epidemiological features of COVID-19 in Iran. METHODS: In this retrospective study, data related to the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients admitted to Baqiyatallah Hospital in Tehran, Iran, from 19 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 have been analyzed and reported. Patient characteristics including age, gender and underlying diseases were investigated. Data were collected through patient records. Sex ratio, Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and daily trend of cases were also determined. A multiple logistic regression analysis was also performed to assess affecting factors on mortality. RESULTS: From February 19, 2020 to April 15, 2020, 12870 patients referred to the hospital emergency department, of which 2968 were hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosis. The majority of cases were in the age group of 50 to 60 years of old. The male-to-female ratio was 1.93:1. A total of 239 deaths occurred among all cases for an overall CFR of 1.85% based on the total number of patients (both outpatient and inpatient) and 8.06% among hospitalized patients. Out of all patients 10.89% had comorbidity. Diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, chronic Kidney diseases and cancer were the most common comorbidities with 3.81, 2.02 , 1.99 , 1.25, 0.60 and 0.57 %, respectively.

Travel medicine practitioners were increasingly called upon to provide pre-cruise travel advice and medical clearance. Demand for these services will return at some time in the future. METHODS: The clinical conditions seen in those presenting for care on six small-vessel scientific cruises to Antarctica were analysed. RESULTS: Personnel presented on 196 occasions resulting in 257 consultations (when initial plus all follow-up consultations were included). Personnel presented with a clinical condition at a rate of 17.9 per 1000 person-days at sea. The total consultation rate was 23.5 per 1000 person-days at sea. Injury accounted for 24% of all presentations at a rate of 4.3 per 1000 person-days at sea. Dermatological, soft tissue and musculoskeletal, general malaise and motion sickness were the four most common presentations. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-cruise advice for travellers planning small-vessel cruises to polar regions needs to include skin care, prevention and management of sea sickness and how to reduce the risk of injury.

The cardio-protective effect of vitamin E in dexamethasone induced oxidative stress was studied. Forty Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups of 10 rats each. Control group received normal rat chow. Oxidative stress was induced using 30µg/kg body weight of dexamethasone (DEX) intraperitonealy in DEX+Vit E and DEX only groups while Vitamin E was administered orally at a dose of 300 IU/kg to Vitamin E only group and DEX+Vit E group daily for 14 days. All animals were fed ad libitum and had free access to water. Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture for biochemical analyses while heart and kidney were processed for histological staining. The result shows a significant (p<0.05) decrease in serum nitric oxide, bilirubin and superoxide dismutase concentration in DEX-only group which was elevated following vitamin E treatment. The angiotensin converting enzyme and lactate dehydrogenase enzyme activities were significantly (p<0.01) elevated in DEX-only group compared with control and DEX+Vit E groups. These enzyme levels were significantly (p<0.01) reduced in DEX + vitamin E group. The histology of the heart and the kidney in DEX-only group showed cardiac hypertrophy and kidney injury but were ameliorated by vitamin E treatment. The results suggest that vitamin E has cardiac and renal protective effect and ameliorates oxidative injury to the heart and kidney due to oxidative stress.","Owu, Daniel U; Okon, Idara A; Ufot, Usenobong F; Beshel, Justin A",Niger J Physiol Sci,393,20

We investigated organ dysfunction associated with changing serum SDC-1 levels for early detection of organ dysfunction in critically ill patients. To evaluate the effect of SDC-1 on laboratory parameters measured the day after SDC-1 measurement with consideration for repeated measures, linear mixed effects models were constructed with each parameter as an outcome variable. A total of 94 patients were enrolled, and 831 samples were obtained. Analysis using mixed effects models for repeated measures with adjustment for age and sex showed that serum SDC-1 levels measured the day before significantly affected several outcomes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), creatinine (CRE), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), antithrombin III, fibrin degradation products, and D-dimer. Moreover, serum SDC-1 levels of the prior day significantly modified the effect between time and several outcomes, including AST, ALT, CRE, and BUN. Additionally, increasing serum SDC-1 level was a significant risk factor for mortality. Serum SDC-1 may be a useful biomarker for daily monitoring to detect early signs of kidney, liver and coagulation system dysfunction, and may be an important risk factor for mortality in critically ill patients.","Suzuki, Keiko; Okada, Hideshi; Sumi, Kazuyuki; Tomita, Hiroyuki; Kobayashi, Ryo; Ishihara, Takuma; Kakino, Yoshinori; Suzuki, Kodai; Yoshiyama, Naomasa; Yasuda, Ryu; Kitagawa, Yuichiro; Fukuta, Tetsuya; Miyake, Takahito; Okamoto, Haruka; Doi, Tomoaki; Yoshida, Takahiro; Yoshida, Shozo; Ogura, Shinji; Suzuki, Akio",Sci Rep,393,25

METHODS: We contacted caregivers of 38 patients with AD who were confined to their homes for nearly two months and asked them to report whether patients experienced any change in neuropsychiatric symptoms during, compared to before, the confinement and rate its severity and impact on themselves using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the 38 patients, only 10 demonstrated neuropsychiatric changes during the confinement. Cognitive function of these 10 patients, assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination, was worse than that of patients who did not demonstrate neuropsychiatric changes. Interestingly, among the 10 patients with neuropsychiatric changes, the duration of confinement significantly correlated with the severity of symptoms as well as with their caregivers' distress.

However, evidence of pharmacists' impact on improving patient outcomes through disease outbreak through telepharmacy is sparse. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to examine pharmacists' attitudes towards clinical benefits and identify challenges regarding the use of telepharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey design was used to recruit eligible participants from both hospital and community pharmacies. RESULTS: A total of 364 pharmacists agreed to participate in the study. The majority of the participants (70.6%) expressed favourable attitudes towards telepharmacy to accurately capture and report signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Almost 91% agreed that patients can receive immediate medical feedback while using telepharmacy services. Pharmacists (87%) emphasised their role in the monitoring of physiological parameters when entered by patients using telepharmacy technology. However, more than half of the participants reported that lack of reimbursement and evidence-based studies might hinder the use of telemedicine technology to deliver remote clinical services.

Clinical characteristics and COVID-19-related outcomes (i.e. intubation for mechanical ventilation [IMV], death and discharge by day 7 [D7]) were analysed according to BMI status. RESULTS: Among 1965 patients with T2D, 434 (22.1%) normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2 , reference group), 726 (36.9%) overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2 ) and 805 (41.0%) obese subjects were analysed, including 491 (25.0%) with class I obesity (30-34.9 kg/m2 ) and 314 (16.0%) with class II/III obesity (&#8805;35 kg/m2 ). In a multivariable-adjusted model, the primary outcome (i.e. IMV and/or death by D7) was significantly associated with overweight (OR 1.65 [1.05-2.59]), class I (OR 1.93 [1.19-3.14]) and class II/III obesity (OR 1.98 [1.11-3.52]). After multivariable adjustment, primary outcome by D7 was significantly associated with obesity in patients aged younger than 75 years, while such an association was no longer found in those aged older than 75 years.

AIM: Establish possible prognostic factors of severe psoriasis. METHODS: Three groups of patients were included: 118 were on topical therapy, 83 used conventional systemic drugs and 112 were treated with biological agents. Based of the fact that patients on topical therapy have a lower grade of disease severity than patients treated systemically, we compared a variety of comorbidities and epidemiological parameters between the three groups. RESULTS: Patients treated more aggressively have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (p = 0.044), suffer more from depression (p = 0.020), hyperuricemia (p = 0.031) and nonspecific non-infectious liver disease (p = 0.005). Male gender (p < 0.001), increased height (p < 0.001), early age of disease onset (p < 0.001), viral upper respiratory infections (p = 0.049) and periods of hormonal changes (p = 0.045) are associated with these therapies. CONCLUSION: Psoriasis severity is directly related to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, depression, hyperuricemia and nonspecific non-infectious liver disease. Male gender, increased height, early age of disease onset, viral upper respiratory infections and periods of hormonal changes seem to be prognostic of higher degrees of psoriasis severity. We are pioneering the use of increased height and puberty, menopause/andropause as independent prognostic factors of psoriasis severity.","Marques, Emanuel; Paluch, Zoltán; Bohác, Petr; Slanar, Ondrej; Belácek, Jaromír; Hercogová, Jana",J Dermatolog Treat,393,20

This study examined the effects of perceived online learning difficulties and cyberbullying on academic engagement and mental health, and if parenting styles and student-teacher relationship moderated these relations among 733 middle school students (54.3% boys) and their parents (M-age = 44.76 years, SD = 4.13 years, 28.1% fathers and 71.9% mothers) from Beijing, China. Results suggested that perceived online learning difficulties and cyberbullying predicted more mental health difficulties;perceived difficulties with online learning negatively predicted academic engagement. Authoritative parenting and positive student-teacher relationship predicted more academic engagement and less mental health difficulties, while authoritarian parenting predicted more mental health difficulties. Student-teacher relationship also moderated the relation between cyberbullying and mental health as well as difficulties with online learning and academic engagement. Parents and adolescents wanted more interactions with teachers and group activities to foster peer relationships, and more support from teachers and school psychologists to address students' social and emotional needs during COVID-19. Implications for school psychologists and school staff are discussed. Impact Statement A majority of Chinese middle school students in our sample experienced difficulties with distance learning during COVID-19, which was negatively related to their academic engagement (e.g., active participation in class) and mental health. This is one of the first studies to highlight the importance of two protective factors (authoritative parenting and positive student-teacher relationships) on student academic engagement and mental health during COVID-19. The findings highlight important implications for school staff (teachers and school psychologists) and provide suggestions on how to better support adolescents in the online learning environment during the COVID-19.","Ye, Y.

METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in three Grade â ¢A hospitals of Jiangsu from Jan 22 to Feb 14, 2020. Real time RT-PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients infected with COVID-19, 41 patients were female, with a median age of 46.1 years. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 9 patients were unconfirmed until a third-time nucleic acid test. 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. The main clinical manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 cases (78.75%) and 51 cases (-63.75%) respectively. Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 55 patients (-68.75%) showed abnormal, 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs. Up to now, 21 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patient died. The average length of stay for discharged patients was 8 days. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate symptoms and no obvious gender susceptivity. The proportion of patients having liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that of Wuhan. Notably, infected patients may be falsely excluded based on two consecutively negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results.","Wu, Jian; Liu, Jun; Zhao, Xinguo; Liu, Chengyuan; Wang, Wei; Wang, Dawei; Xu, Wei; Zhang, Chunyu; Yu, Jiong; Jiang, Bin; Cao, Hongcui; Li, Lanjuan",Clin. infect. dis,393,22

We assessed the level of fear of COVID-19 in Hong Kong adults and its associations with sociodemographic factors and perceived benefits and harms of COVID-19. In a 6-day population-based cross-sectional online survey in May 2020, 4,890 adults provided data on fear and perceived benefits and harms, personal happiness and family well-being, and sociodemographic characteristics. Linear regression was used to analyze associations. The level of fear was moderate (mean score 6.3/10). Fewer respondents reported perceived benefits (10.6%-21.7%) than harms (13.4%-43.5%). Females, younger age groups, and respondents with lower education or more cohabitants had greater fear. Fear was associated with perceived personal (increased knowledge of personal epidemic prevention) and family benefits (improved family hygiene), both with a very small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.03). Fear was also associated with lower personal happiness and perceived personal (increased negative emotions, feeling depressed and anxious, decreased income, and decreased work efficiency) and family harms (increased conflicts and negative emotions among family members), with small effect sizes (0.08-0.37). We have first shown sociodemographic differences in the fear of COVID-19 and such fear was associated with both perceived personal and family benefits and harms of COVID-19. Our findings may guide the management of fear to reduce sociodemographic differences, and maximize benefits and minimize harms.","Sit, Shirley Man-Man; Lam, Tai-Hing; Lai, Agnes Yuen-Kwan; Wong, Bonny Yee-Man; Wang, Man-Ping; Ho, Sai-Yin",Transl Behav Med,393,16

Because of limited resources, health-managers must choose well-balanced solutions able to protect patients and citizens on the one hand and to provide maximal benefit for the society on the other hand. We are going through a moment of rupture that we must acknowledge. Here, we discussed how the doctor-patient relationship could be compromised. Doctors are focused on cares whereas patients are focused on scare. Profound changes occur presently, from the way we present ourselves to each other (including the masks), the poor conditions for physical examination, the mental suffering of both patient and caregiver until sometimes terrible end-of-life conditions. The historical point-of-view helps us to keep in mind previous experiences, and the philosophical perspective helps to contextualize this unedited situation.

Selective breeding for the naturally occurring social immune trait ""hygienic behavior"" has emerged as one sustainable approach to reducing the mites' impact on honey bees. To expand our understanding of hygienic triggers and improve hygienic selection tools, we tested the hypothesis that the cuticular compounds (Z)-10-tritriacontene and (Z)-6-pentadecene, previously associated with unhealthy honey bee brood and/or brood targeted for hygiene, are triggers of honey bee hygienic behavior independent of brood health. In support of our hypothesis, application of synthetic (Z)-10-tritriacontene and (Z)-6-pentadecene onto brood and brood cell caps significantly increased hygienic behavior compared to application of similarly structured hydrocarbon controls (Z)-16-dotriacontene and (Z)-7-pentadecene. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant positive correlation between colony-level hygienic responses to (Z)-10-tritriacontene and the traditional freeze-killed brood assay for selection of hygienic honey bee stocks. These results confirm biological activity of (Z)-6-pentadecene and reveal (Z)-10-tritriacontene as a novel hygiene trigger. They also support development of improved tools for honey bee colony monitoring and hygienic selection, and thus may accelerate development of honey bee stocks with greater resistance to Varroa and associated pathogens.","Wagoner, Kaira M; Millar, Jocelyn G; Schal, Coby; Rueppell, Olav",Sci Rep,393,1

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been reported to increase ACE2 expression in animal models, and worse outcomes are reported in patients with co-morbidities commonly treated with these agents, leading to controversy during the COVID-19 pandemic over whether these drugs might be helpful or harmful. METHODS: Animal, in vitro and clinical data relevant to the biology of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), its interaction with the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) and SARS-CoV-2, and clinical studies were reviewed. FINDINGS AND INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 hijacks ACE2to invade and damage cells, downregulating ACE2, reducing its protective effects and exacerbating injurious Ang II effects.

We study how labor demand in Mexico has been affected during the pandemic by web scraping job ads from a leading job search website. As in the U.S., the number of vacancies in Mexico declined sharply during the lockdown (38 percent). In April there was a change in the composition of labor demand, and wages dropped across the board. By May, however, the wage distribution and the distribution of job ads by occupation returned to their pre-pandemic levels. Overall, there was a slight decline in specific requirements (gender and age), no change in required experience, and a temporary in-crease in demand for low-skilled workers. Contrary to expectations, opportunities for telecommuting diminished during the pandemic. Using a simple Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, we find that the variation in the average advertised wage in April is explained more by a higher proportion of low-wage occupations than by a reduction in the wages paid for particular occupations. In sum, we find no evidence of a significant or permanent change in labor demand during the pandemic in Mexico. © 2021, Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C..

It has extensive biological properties such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus developing severe pneumonitis. Inflammasome is one of the most important components of innate immunity, which exacerbates inflammation by increasing IL-1ß and IL-18 production. Studies on viral infections have shown overactivity of inflammasome and thus the occurrence of destructive and systemic inflammation in patients. NLRP3 inflammasome has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of viral diseases. The proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in a wide range of cells can be combined with numerous observations of direct and indirect activation of inflammasome by other coronaviruses. Activation of the inflammasome is likely to be involved in the formation of cytokine storm. Curcumin regulates several molecules in the intracellular signal transduction pathways involved in inflammation, including IBB, NF-kBERK1,2, AP-1, TGF-ß, TXNIP, STAT3, PPARÎ³, JAK2-STAT3, NLRP3, p38MAPK, Nrf2, Notch-1, AMPK, TLR-4 and MyD-88. Due to anti-inflammatory and anti-inflammasome properties without any special side effects, curcumin can potentially play a role in the treatment of COVID-19 infection along with other drug regimens.","Saeedi-Boroujeni, Ali; Mahmoudian-Sani, Mohammad-Reza; Bahadoram, Mohammad; Alghasi, Arash",Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,393,17

The search followed World Health Organisation (WHO) Europe's health workforce guidance on Covid-19. Content analysis was performed, informed by the themes of WHO. RESULTS: The pandemic preparedness plans consisted of no or limited information on how to expand and prepare the health workforce during pandemics. The 16 states varied considerably regarding implementing strategies to expand health workforce capacities. Only one state adopted a policy on task-shifting despite a federal law on task-shifting during pandemics. CONCLUSIONS: Planning on the health workforce, its capacity and skill-mix during pandemics was limited in the pandemic response plans. Actions during the peak of the pandemic varied considerably across states, were implemented ad hoc and with limited planning. Future action should focus on integrated planning and evaluation of workforce policies.","Köppen, Julia; Hartl, Kimberly; Maier, Claudia B",Int. j. health plann. manage,393,5

Its collaborative and reflexive process invites stakeholders (e.g. pharmacists and pharmacy support staff) to participate in analysing their everyday work practices as captured on video footage. Through close collaboration with practitioners and attention to their work contexts, VRE may be a useful methodology to engage a time-poor pharmacy workforce in research about themselves, encouraging more practitioner involvement in practice-based research. Aside from research, VRE has also been used effectively as an intervention to facilitate learning and change in healthcare settings, and could be effective in provoking change in otherwise resistant pharmacy environments. Much like traditional ethnographic approaches, VRE researchers have relied on being present 'in the field' to observe, record and make sense of practices with participants. The COVID-19 pandemic however, has introduced restrictions around travel and physical distancing, which has required researchers to contemplate the conduct of VRE 'at a distance', and to imagine new ways in which the methodological 'closeness' to stakeholders and their workplace contexts can be maintained when researchers cannot be on site. In this commentary, we outline the rationale for participatory methods, in the form of VRE, in pharmacy research. We describe the underlying principles of this innovative methodology, and offer examples of how VRE can be used in pharmacy research. Finally, we offer a reflexive account of how we have adapted the method for use in community pharmacy research, to adapt to physical distancing, without sacrificing its methodological principles. This paper offers not only a new methodology to examine the complexity of pharmacy work, but demonstrates also the responsiveness of VRE itself to complexity, and the potential breadth of future research applications in pharmacy both during and beyond the current pandemic.","Yong, Faith R; Hor, Su-Yin; Bajorek, Beata V",Res. soc. adm. pharm,393,16

METHODS: A survey study was conducted on 254 Egyptian house officers using an anonymous web-based questionnaire that was filled using Google Forms after obtaining online informed consent. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 25 years. Only 28.74% of the house officers were categorized as having a good preparedness, while 85.83% of them have a good PPE attitude. The preparedness and willingness were significantly associated with the overall worry related to the pandemic (P value = 0.012).

Real-life data on immune responses elicited in the most vulnerable group of vaccinees over 80 years old is still underrepresented despite the prioritization of the elderly in vaccination campaigns. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study with two age groups, young vaccinees below the age of 60 and elderly vaccinees over the age of 80, to compare their antibody responses to the first and second dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: While the majority of participants in both groups produced specific IgG antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, titers were significantly lower in elderly participants. Although the increment of antibody levels after the second immunization was higher in elderly participants, the absolute mean titer of this group remained lower than the <60 group. After the second vaccination, 31.3 % of the elderly had no detectable neutralizing antibodies in contrast to the younger group, in which only 2.2% had no detectable neutralizing antibodies. CONCLUSION: Our data showed differences between the antibody responses raised after the first and second BNT162b2 vaccination, in particular lower frequencies of neutralizing antibodies in the elderly group. This suggests that this population needs to be closely monitored and may require earlier revaccination or/and an increased vaccine dose to ensure stronger long lasting immunity and protection against infection.","Müller, Lisa; Andrée, Marcel; Moskorz, Wiebke; Drexler, Ingo; Walotka, Lara; Grothmann, Ramona; Ptok, Johannes; Hillebrandt, Jonas; Ritchie, Anastasia; Rabl, Denise; Ostermann, Philipp Niklas; Robitzsch, Rebekka; Hauka, Sandra; Walker, Andreas; Menne, Christopher; Grutza, Ralf; Timm, Jörg; Adams, Ortwin; Schaal, Heiner",Clin. infect. dis,393,13

This outbreak spread rapidly to the community through high-risk groups. This study describes the characteristics of COVID-19 cases based on S religious group membership and summarizes the Daegu municipal government's processes and responses to control the outbreak. METHODS: The epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases were obtained through basic and in-depth epidemiological surveys. General characteristics, the proportion of asymptomatic cases, the case-fatality rate, and the time-to-event within each group were presented after stratifying confirmed cases according to S religious group membership. RESULTS: Overall, 7,008 COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Daegu from February 18, 2020 to June 30, 2020, and 61.5% (n= 4,309) were S religious group members. Compared with non-members, members had a higher proportion of female (p< 0.001) and younger age (p< 0.001), as well as lower disease prevalence. At the time of the investigation, 38.4% of cases in members were asymptomatic versus 23.7% of cases in non-members (p< 0.001). The case-fatality rate of non-members aged &#8805; 60 years was significantly higher than that of members (p< 0.001). Compared with non-members, members had longer intervals from symptom onset to diagnosis (p< 0.001) and from diagnosis to admission (p< 0.001), and a shorter interval from admission to discharge (p< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological features of S religious group members, including the proportion of asymptomatic cases, case-fatality rate, and time-to-event, differed from non-members. The Daegu authorities prevented further COVID-19 spread through immediate isolation and active screening tests of all S religious group members.","Kim, Jong-Yeon; Lee, Yu-Mi; Lee, Hwajin; Kim, Jung-Whan; Kim, Shin-Woo",Epidemiol Health,393,19

Subsequently, all elective and aesthetic procedures have been cancelled or deferred in accordance with government-mandated quarantine measures. The Cosmetic Surgery Governance Forum (CSGF) is a network of aesthetic plastic surgery consultants which has enabled a sharing of expertise during challenging times. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aesthetic plastic surgeons and their practice in the UK. METHODS: On 15 June 2020, 131 respondents from the CSGF and wider aesthetic plastic surgeons in the UK were invited to respond to an online survey. An anonymised questionnaire was created using SmartSurveyTM and distributed at the end of the quarantine period. Questions regarding their current scope of practice, willingness to recommence face-to-face consultations, financial loss and psychological impact were asked. RESULTS: A total of 101 Consultant Plastic surgeons (76%) completed the questionnaire. If strict protocols and adequate personal protective equipment were available, 50-55% of respondents would consider offering non-surgical treatments as soon as the private clinic was open. Furthermore, 51% would consider procedures under general anaesthetic, whilst 89% of respondents would offer local anaesthetic only in the initial phase. Moreover, 66% reported experiencing a psychological impact and 100% of respondents reported a significant financial impact. CONCLUSIONS: This survey aims to give an account of the current state (May-July 2020) of aesthetic plastic surgery in the UK.

It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using chest CT. Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods In this retrospective and multicenter study, a deep learning model, the COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT scans for the detection of COVID-19. CT scans of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia abnormalities were included to test the robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from six hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Results The collected dataset consisted of 4352 chest CT scans from 3322 patients. The average patient age (±standard deviation) was 49 years ± 15, and there were slightly more men than women (1838 vs 1484, respectively; P = .29). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83%, 94%; 114 of 127 scans) and 96% (95% CI: 93%, 98%; 294 of 307 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96 (P < .001). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175 scans) and 92% (239 of 259 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97). Conclusion A deep learning model can accurately detect coronavirus 2019 and differentiate it from community-acquired pneumonia and other lung conditions. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.","Li, Lin; Qin, Lixin; Xu, Zeguo; Yin, Youbing; Wang, Xin; Kong, Bin; Bai, Junjie; Lu, Yi; Fang, Zhenghan; Song, Qi; Cao, Kunlin; Liu, Daliang; Wang, Guisheng; Xu, Qizhong; Fang, Xisheng; Zhang, Shiqin; Xia, Juan; Xia, Jun",Radiology,393,20

Drought and heat stresses are factors severely limiting the high-quality development of the yellowhorn industry. Transcription factors (TFs) play critical roles in regulating the response of woody plant species to water deficit or high temperature. However, the MYB TFs that respond to combined drought and heat stress in yellowhorn remain unclear. Here, we first investigated the physiological changes in 5 yellowhorn varieties in response to combined stress treatments. We observed significant changes in antioxidant enzyme activities and photosynthesis. The Maigaiti variety yielded the best results and was selected for subsequent experiments. An R2R3-type MYB TF, designated XsMYB44, was isolated from the leaves of yellowhorn. XsMYB44 expression was strongly induced by combined stress. Suppression of XsMYB44 expression via virus-induced gene silencing weakened yellowhorn tolerance to both individual and combined drought and heat stress, and the increased susceptibility was coupled with decreased plant height, fresh weight and relative water content and inhibited stomatal closure. Moreover, compared with the individual stresses, the combined stress caused increased reactive oxygen species levels and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities and proline content in XsMYB44-silenced plants. Furthermore, the expression levels of several defense-related genes were reduced in the XsMYB44-silenced plants. Overall, we studied the physiological characteristics of 5 yellowhorn varieties, and the results demonstrated that XsMYB44 acts as a positive regulator in the yellowhorn response to combined stress by triggering stomatal closure to maintain water levels and by modulating ROS homeostasis.","Li, Jingbin; Zhao, Shang; Yu, Xue; Du, Wei; Li, He; Sun, Ying; Sun, Hao; Ruan, Chengjiang",Plant Physiol Biochem,393,10

As vaccines become available, their distribution, safety, and efficacy against emerging variants remain uncertain, and specific treatments are lacking. Recent Advances: Initially affecting the lungs, COVID-19 is a complex multisystems disease that disturbs the whole-body redox balance and can be long-lasting (Long-COVID). Numerous risk factors have been identified, but the reasons for variations in susceptibility to infection, disease severity, and outcome are poorly understood. The reactive species interactome (RSI) was recently introduced as a framework to conceptualize how cells and whole organisms sense, integrate, and accommodate stress. Critical Issues: We here consider COVID-19 as a redox disease, offering a holistic perspective of its effects on the human body, considering the vulnerability of complex interconnected systems with multiorgan/multilevel interdependencies. Host/viral glycan interactions underpin SARS-CoV-2's extraordinary efficiency in gaining cellular access, crossing the epithelial/endothelial barrier to spread along the vascular/lymphatic endothelium, and evading antiviral/antioxidant defences. An inflammation-driven ""oxidative storm"" alters the redox landscape, eliciting epithelial, endothelial, mitochondrial, metabolic, and immune dysfunction, and coagulopathy. Concomitantly reduced nitric oxide availability renders the sulfur-based redox circuitry vulnerable to oxidation, with eventual catastrophic failure in redox communication/regulation. Host nutrient limitations are crucial determinants of resilience at the individual and population level. Future Directions: While inflicting considerable damage to health and well-being, COVID-19 may provide the ultimate testing ground to improve the diagnosis and treatment of redox-related stress diseases. ""Redox phenotyping"" of patients to characterize whole-body RSI status as the disease progresses may inform new therapeutic approaches to regain redox balance, reduce mortality in COVID-19 and other redox diseases, and provide opportunities to tackle Long-COVID.","Cumpstey, Andrew F; Clark, Anna D; Santolini, Jérôme; Jackson, Alan A; Feelisch, Martin",Antioxid. redox signal,393,30

The aim of this paper is to present a case report of an COVID-19 patient with severe hypocalcaemia. This is a report of an 81-year-old female, suffered from myalgia and fatigue for more than 3-4 weeks. Fever and cough appear 2 days before she presented to the emergency room. On physical examination, she was febrile with a temperature of 38.8°C, accompanied by cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, and muscle ache. Her past medical history was remarkable with no chronic disease. She had lymphopenia. Laboratory test revealed moderate liver dysfunction, hypoalbuminemia, and severe hypocalcaemia (serum corrected calcium level: 5.7 mg/dL). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) was 107.9 pg/mL (range: 15-65) and 25(OH)2D levels was 4.5 ng/mL (range: 25-80). Chest CT scan detected peripheral ground-glass opacity. Throat swab for coronavirus by RT-PCR assay tested positive for the virus. She was treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, third generation cephalosporin, anticoagulant, daily high-dose calcium acetate, vitamin D3, fresh frozen plasma and oxygen therapy. She was discharged after two negative throat swab tests for coronavirus by conventional RT-PCR. Learning points: Comorbidities are a risk factor for patients with COVID-19. Laboratory findings are unspecific in COVID-19 patients; laboratory abnormalities include lymphopenia, elevated of LDH, CPK and the inflammatory markers, such as C reactive protein, ferritinemia and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In addition to inflammatory markers, in COVID-19 patients it is crucial to check the level of vitamin D and calcium. There may be a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and the severity of COVID-19 disease.","Puca, Edmond; Puca, Entela; Pipero, Pellumb; Kraja, Holta; Como, Najada",,393,16

The goal of this study was to better understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the non-institutionalized disabled population in the United States using data from the most affected states as of April 9th, 2020. METHODS: This was an ecological study of county-level factors associated with the infection and mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the non-institutionalized disabled population. We analyzed data from 369 counties from the most affected states (Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Louisiana, Massachusetts) in the United States using data available by April 9th, 2020. The variables include changes in mobility reported by Google, race/ethnicity, median income, education level, health insurance, and disability information from the United States Census Bureau. Bivariate regression analysis adjusted for state and median income was used to analyze the association between death rate and infection rate. RESULTS: The independent sample t-test of two groups (group 1: Death rate≥ 3.4% [median] and group 2: Death rate < 3.4%) indicates that counties with a higher total population, a lower percentage of Black males and females, higher median income, higher education, and lower percentage of disabled population have a lower rate (< 3.4%) of SARS-CoV-2 related mortality (all p-values<4.3E-02). The results of the bivariate regression when controlled for median income and state show counties with a higher White disabled population (est: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.01–0.37; p-value:3.7E-02), and higher population with independent living difficulty (est: 0.15, 95% CI: −0.01–0.30; p-value: 6.0E-02) have a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 related mortality. Also, the regression analysis indicates that counties with higher White disabled population (est: −0.22, 95% CI: −0.43−(−0.02); p-value: 3.3E-02), higher population with hearing disability (est: −0.26, 95% CI: −0.42–(−0.11); p-value:1.2E-03), and higher population with disability in the 18–34 years age group (est: −0.25, 95% CI: −0.41–(−0.09); p-value:2.4E-03) show a lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that while counties with a higher percentage of non-institutionalized disabled population, especially White disabled population, show a lower infection rate, they have a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 related mortality.","Olulana, Oluwaseyi; Abedi, Vida; Avula, Venkatesh; Chaudhary, Durgesh; Khan, Ayesha; Shahjouei, Shima; Li, Jiang; Zand, Ramin",medRxiv,393,1

However, the closures of childcare, early education programs, and centers for family activities in the Spring of 2020 due to COVID-19 brought many sudden changes to the everyday lives of families with young children. In order to explore the impact of COVID-19 on shared reading, we surveyed parents of children between the ages of 2 and 5 (n = 85) about their children’s frequency of shared reading engagement in February and October, 2020 as well as the frequency of screen-mediated reading, the number of readers their children read with, and book preferences at both time points. Parents were also asked about changes in their children’s regular care and whether and how they had tried new kinds of (virtual) literacy activities during their increased time at home. Findings showed that there were no significant changes in frequency of shared reading from February to October, but there was a significant increase in frequency of screen-mediated reading, especially among families who lost outside-the-home childcare. There was also a significant decrease in the number of adults regularly reading with the children. Caregivers described adapting to virtual options for storytime. Ultimately, while families were still able to provide consistent amounts of shared reading with their children throughout COVID-19, the nature of that shared reading was changed. Future research will investigate whether these changes may have an impact on children’s typical learning from shared reading.","Read, Kirsten; Gaffney, Grace; Chen, Ashley; Imran, Amina",Early Child Educ J,393,30

The home range of feral cats was also analyzed during daytime and nighttime, and all five individuals showed a wider home range during the nighttime than daytime. The analysis of gender shows that the average home range of female feral cats is larger than the average of males. Meanwhile, the results of information data with wide-open areas such as farm land and terrace land on the river showed that the analyzed value was increased generally, and showed variable values depending on the gender and size of each individual feral cat.","Moon, Oun-Kyong; Lee, Han-soo; Kim, In-kyu; Kang, Tae-han; Cho, Hae-jin; Kim, Dal-ho",Journal of Asia-Pacific Biodiversity,393,9

It also serves as an important binding site for SARS-CoV-2, thereby, facilitating viral entry into target host cells. ACE 2 is abundantly present in the intestine, kidney, heart, lungs, and fetal tissues. Fetal ACE 2 is involved in myocardium growth, lungs and brain development. ACE 2 is highly expressed in pregnant women to compensate preeclampsia by modulating angiotensin (1–7) which binds to the Mas receptor, having vasodilator action and maintain fluid homeostasis. There are reports available on Zika, H1N1 and SARS-CoV where these viruses have shown to produce fetal defects but very little is known about SARS-CoV-2 involvement in pregnancy, but it might have the potential to interact with fetal ACE 2 and enhance COVID-19 transmission to the fetus, leading to fetal morbidity and mortality. This review sheds light on a path of SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk in pregnancy and its possible link with fetal ACE 2.","Dhaundiyal, Ankit; Kumari, Puja; Jawalekar, Snehal Sainath; Chauhan, Gaurav; Kalra, Sourav; Navik, Umashanker",Life Sci,393,20

To address the gaps in the literature, this study advances an integrated approach of neighborhood social support from criminology and comorbidity model from health science to examine the correlates of stalking victimization. Relying on data from Canadian General Social Survey, results confirm that the correlation model is better justifiable than the causal model in exploring the relationships between risk factors and being stalked and that variables broadly derived from social support theory, such as community order and trust, are statistically significant correlates of stalking victimization. In addition, most variables in the comorbidity model are significant correlates of stalking victimization. We conclude that social contexts and individual life habits are both important for the risk of stalking victimization.","Cao, Liqun; Kevin Wang, Shun-Yung",Int J Law Crime Justice,393,17

In a context of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance needed proper and fast assessment of epidemiological clusters from large amount of samples, the present manuscript proposes a workflow for identifying accurately the PANGOLIN lineages of SARS-CoV-2 samples and building of discriminant minimum spanning trees (MST) bypassing the usual time consuming phylogenomic inferences based on multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and substitution model. RESULTS: GENPAT constituted two collections of SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples of the first collection were isolated by IZSAM in the Abruzzo region (Italy), then shotgun sequenced and analyzed in GENPAT (n = 1 592), while those of the second collection were isolated from several Italian provinces and retrieved from the reference Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (n = 17 201). The main outcomes of the present study showed that (i) GENPAT and GISAID identified identical PANGOLIN lineages, (ii) the PANGOLIN lineages B.1.177 (i.e. historical in Italy) and B.1.1.7 (i.e. 'UK variant') are major concerns today in several Italian provinces, and the new MST-based method (iii) clusters most of the PANGOLIN lineages together, (iv) with a higher dicriminatory power than PANGOLIN, (v) and faster that the usual phylogenomic methods based on MSA and substitution model. CONCLUSIONS: The shotgun sequencing efforts of Italian provinces, combined to a structured national system of metagenomics data management, provided support for surveillance SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. We recommend to infer phylogenomic relationships of SARS-CoV-2 variants through an accurate, discriminant and fast MST-based method bypassing the usual time consuming steps related to MSA and substitution model-based phylogenomic inference.","Di Pasquale, A.; Radomski, N.; Mangone, I.; Calistri, P.; Lorusso, A.; Camma, C.",,393,0

Given the global increase in number of cases and mortalities due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to identify predictive features that assist identification of individuals most at-risk of COVID-19 mortality and thus, enable planning for effective usage of medical resources. The impact of individual variables in an XGBoost artificial intelligence model, applied to a dataset containing 57,390 individual COVID-19 cases and 2,822 patient deaths in Ontario, is explored with the use of SHapley Additive exPlanations values. The most important variables were found to be: age, date of the positive test, sex, income, dementia plus many more that were considered. The utility of SHapley Additive exPlanations dependency graphs is used to provide greater interpretation of the black-box XGBoost mortality prediction model, allowing focus on the non-linear relationships to improve insights. A “Test-date Dependency” plot indicates mortality risk dropped substantially over time, as likely a result of the improved treatment being developed within the medical system. As well, the findings indicate that people of lower income and people from more ethnically diverse communities, face an increased mortality risk due to COVID-19 within Ontario. These findings will help guide clinical decision-making for patients with COVID-19.","Snider, Brett; Patel, Bhumi; McBean, Edward",Front Artif Intell,393,12

Yet, we still have a limited understanding of how data reshapes international economic relations. This paper explores various aspects of data politics through the lens of China’s digital rise and the country’s global engagement. I start with the theoretical premise that data differs from traditional strategic assets (e.g., land, oil, and labor), in that it is nonrival and partially excludable. These characteristics have generated externality, commitment, and valuation problems, triggering three fundamental changes in China’s external economic relations. First, data’s externality problem makes it necessary for states to regulate data or even to pursue data sovereignty. However, clashes over data sovereignty can ignite conflicts between China and other countries. Second, the commitment problem in data use raises global concerns about foreign government surveillance. As data is easier to transfer across borders than physical commodities, Chinese tech companies’ investments abroad are vulnerable to national security investigations by foreign regulators. Chinese tech companies, therefore, confront a “deep versus broad” dilemma: deep ties with the Chinese government help promote their domestic business but jeopardize their international expansion. Lastly, data’s valuation problem makes traditional measures (e.g., GDP) ill-suited to measure the relative strengths of the world’s economies, which may distort perceptions of China and other states.","Liu, Lizhi",Stud Comp Int Dev,393,10

METHODS: We analyzed positive COVID-19 testing results counts within New York City ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) with Bayesian hierarchical Poisson spatial models using integrated nested Laplace approximations. RESULTS: Spatial clustering accounted for approximately 32% of the variation in the data. There was a nearly five-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test. (IDR = 4.8, 95% Cr I 2.4, 9.7) associated with the proportion of Black / African American residents. Increases in the proportion of residents older than 65 years, housing density and the proportion of residents with heart disease were each associated with an approximate doubling of risk. In a multivariable model including estimates for age, COPD, heart disease, housing density and Black/African American race, the only variables that remained associated with positive COVID-19 testing with a probability greater than chance were the proportion of Black/African American residents and proportion of older persons.

This study aims to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs. 37 [32, 41] years, U = 4.932, P = 0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%, χ(2) = 9.291, P = 0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]°C, U = 2.057, P = 0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5% vs. 20.9%, χ(2) = 5.611, P = 0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, U = 4.030, P = 0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U = 1.315, P = 0.024). Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62 ± 6.60 vs. 41.27 ± 4.55 g/L, U = 2.843, P = 0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (χ(2) = 16.01, P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628–44.864; P = 0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95% CI: 1.577–25.000; P = 0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999; 95% CI: 1.036–78.147, P = 0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95% CI: 1.942–40.000; P = 0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95% CI: 1.098–50.000; P = 0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95% CI: 1.224−34.701, P = 0.028) were risk factors for disease progression.

This partial return to regionalization will involve a form of de-globalization that transforms modern just-in-time management into its just-in-case counterpart, because resilience will be priced and discounted for by enterprises and governments alike.

In this study we performed genome‐wide microarray analyses of the expression patterns of mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV)‐infected cells. At the time of MHV‐induced host translational shutoff, downregulation of numerous mRNAs, many of which encode protein translation‐related factors, was observed. This downregulation, which is reminiscent of a cellular stress response, was dependent on viral replication and caused by mRNA decay. Concomitantly, phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α was increased in MHV‐infected cells. In addition, stress granules and processing bodies appeared, which are sites for mRNA stalling and degradation respectively. We propose that MHV replication induces host translational shutoff by triggering an integrated stress response. However, MHV replication per se does not appear to benefit from the inhibition of host protein synthesis, at least in vitro, since viral replication was not negatively affected but rather enhanced in cells with impaired translational shutoff.","Raaben, Matthijs; Groot Koerkamp, Marian J.

Pathological pulmonary changes were successively detected on days 5–60 after virus inoculation. All eight animals showed a transient fever 2–3 days after inoculation. Immunological, molecular biological, and pathological studies support the establishment of this SARS animal model. Firstly, SARS‐CoV‐specific IgGs were detected in the sera of macaques from 11 to 60 days after inoculation. Secondly, SARS‐CoV RNA could be detected in pharyngeal swab samples using nested RT‐PCR in all infected animals from 5 days after virus inoculation. Finally, histopathological changes of interstitial pneumonia were found in the lungs during the 60 days after viral inoculation: these changes were less marked at later time points, indicating that an active healing process together with resolution of an acute inflammatory response was taking place in these animals. This animal model should provide insight into the mechanisms of SARS‐CoV‐related pulmonary disease and greatly facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS.

A secondary objective was to explore if GPs’ individual characteristics and type of practice determined their adaptation. DESIGN: Observational study using an online questionnaire. Organisational changes were measured by a main question and detailed in two specific outcomes. To identify which GPs’ characteristics impacted organisational changes, successive multivariate logistic modelling was performed. First, we identified the GPs’ characteristics related to organisational changes with a univariate analysis. Then, we tested the adjusted associations between this variable and the following GPs’ characteristics: age, gender and type of practice. SETTING: The questionnaire was administered online between 14 March and 21 March 2020. Practitioners were recruited by email using the contact lists of different French scientific GP societies. PARTICIPANTS: The target population was GPs currently practising in France (n=46 056). We obtained a total of 7481 responses. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome: Proportion of GPs who adapted their practice. Secondary outcome: GPs’ characteristics related to organisational changes. RESULTS: Among the 7481 responses, 5425 were complete and were analysed. 3849 GPs (70.9%) changed their activity, 3605 GPs (66.5%) increased remote consultations and 2315 GPs (42.7%) created a specific pathway for probable patients with COVID-19. Among the 3849 GPs (70.9%) who changed their practice, 3306 (91.7%) gave more answers by phone, 996 (27.6%) by email and 1105 (30.7%) increased the use of video consultations. GPs working in multi-professional group practices were more likely to have changed their activity since the beginning of the epidemic wave than GPs working in mono-professional group or single medical practices (adjusted OR: 1.32, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.56, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: French GPs adapted their practices regarding access to care for patients in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic.

The etiology of KD has been studied comprehensively but remains largely unknown. The disease seems to result from the interplay of genetic and environmental susceptibility factors with infectious triggers, followed by a subsequent abnormal immune response characterized by increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during the acute phase. Evidence has mounted to suggest that an imbalance between T helper 17 cells (Th17s) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) is associated with aberrant immune responses in KD. Recent advances in culture-independent techniques for detection and identification of intestinal commensal bacteria enabled the discovery that Th17 and Treg differentiation are regulated by short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in particular butyrate, produced by the gut microbiota. This finding provided a mechanistic link between dysbiosis, defined as changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, and various inflammatory diseases. On this basis, we propose that dysbiosis, with reduced production of SCFAs leading to imbalances of Th17s/Tregs, could be involved in the etiology of KD. A pilot study supported this hypothesis, as only fecal concentrations of butyrate were significantly reduced in KD patients among SCFAs.

It has been the largest MERS outbreak outside the Middle East, with 186 confirmed cases and, among them, 36 fatal cases as of July 26, 2015. All confirmed cases are suspected to be hospital-acquired infections except one case of household transmission and two cases still undergoing examination. The Korean health care system has been the major factor shaping the unique characteristics of the outbreak. Taking this as an opportunity, the Korean government should carefully assess the fundamental problems of the vulnerability to hospital infection and make short- as well as long-term plans for countermeasures. In addition, it is hoped that this journal, Epidemiology and Health, becomes a place where various topics regarding MERS can be discussed and shared.","Ki, Moran",Epidemiol Health,393,24

Interpersonal distance is critical for the spread dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19’s spread trend shows various characteristics in different countries. We believe that 1 of the factors influencing this variation could be national interpersonal distance preference. METHODS: We used regression analysis based on data of national interpersonal distance preferences (social, personal, and intimate) presented by Sorokowska et al. and COVID-19 rate of spread data for 40 different countries that were calculated using Our World in Data’s data. RESULTS: National interpersonal distance preferences, with its 3 dimensions, significantly influence the rate of spread of COVID-19 in countries. CONCLUSION: Understanding the relation between national interpersonal distance preference and spread of COVID-19 might be very useful information in decision-making processes of individuals, societies, and governments to develop culturally well-suited counter-pandemic policies, strategies, and procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic or any epidemic or pandemic threats in the future, instead of standard fit-to-all strategies.","Gokmen, Yunus; Turen, Ufuk; Erdem, Haluk; Tokmak, İsmail",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,393,11

Therefore, the safety of NSAIDs is still questioned. Methods: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases from December 2019 to January 2021 to examine use prevalence for NSAIDs in general, as well as associated COVID-19 risk and outcomes. This study has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019132063) Results: We included 25 studies with a total of 101,215 COVID-19 patients. The use of NSAIDs in COVID-19 patients reached 19%. Exposure to NSAIDs was not associated with significantly increased risk of developing COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR]=0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.78-1.24; I2=82%), hospitalization (OR=1.06, 95%CI: 0.76-1.48; I2=81%), mechanical ventilation (OR=0.71, 95%CI: 0.47-1.06; I2=38%), and length of hospital stay. Moreover, use of NSAIDs was significantly associated with better outcomes, including severity of COVID-19 (OR=0.79, 95%CI: 71-0.89; I2=0%) and death (OR=0.68, 95%CI: 0.52-0.89; I2=85%) in patients with COVID-19. Regarding safety outcomes, exposure to NSAIDs was associated with increased risk of stroke (OR=2.32, 95%CI: 1.04-5.2; I2=0%), but not with myocardial infraction (OR=1.49; p=0.66; I2=0%), overt thrombosis (OR=0.76, p=0.50; I2=28%) and major bleeding (p=0.61). Conclusion: Based on current evidence, exposure to NSAIDs is not linked to increased odds or exacerbation of COVID-19 in the general COVID-19 population. Furthermore, administration of NSAIDs might have better outcomes and survival benefits in the general COVID-19 population, although potentially increasing the risk of stroke. Use of NSAIDs might be safe and beneficial in COVID-19. Future observational and randomized control trials are needed for further confirmation.","zhao, h.; huang, s.; mei, k.; shao, w.; jiang, y.; zhu, w.; ma, j.; zhang, j.; yu, p.; liu, x.",,393,21

It is not only associated with systemic inflammatory symptoms, but also hematological complications such as coagulopathy. CRS can affect various components of the coagulation pathway, including the endothelial cells, platelets, coagulation cascade, and fibrinolytic system. Different causes of CRS, such as primary hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (HLH), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, and COVID-19, have different cytokine profiles and coagulopathy presentations, with microvascular thrombosis surfacing as a common pathology. HLH shares many features with severe CRS, and is characterized by severe consumptive coagulopathy, frequent disseminated intravascular coagulation and an increased bleeding risk. CAR T-cell therapy is characterized by frequent and mild consumptive coagulopathy, as well as an increased risk of thrombosis. While consumptive coagulopathy is rare in COVID-19, it is associated with an increased thrombotic risk. The differences can be explained by the severity of CRS and underlying conditions associated with coagulopathy. Various treatments, including cytokine inhibitors, plasma exchange, Janus kinases inhibitors, complement blockade, and corticosteroids are being studied to mitigate CRS-related coagulopathy.","Wang, Jiasheng; Doran, John",Clin Hematol Int,393,18

We compared 166 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed between February 27 and June 14, 2020, and 255 patients with seasonal influenza diagnosed during the 2017–18 season at the same hospital to describe common features and differences in clinical characteristics and course of disease. Patients with COVID-19 were younger (median age [IQR], 59 [45–71] vs 66 [52–77]; P < 0001) and had fewer comorbidities at baseline with a lower mean overall age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (mean [SD], 3.0 [2.6] vs 4.0 [2.7]; P < 0.001) than patients with seasonal influenza. COVID-19 patients had a longer duration of hospitalization (mean [SD], 25.9 days [26.6 days] vs 17.2 days [21.0 days]; P = 0.002), a more frequent need for oxygen therapy (101 [60.8%] vs 103 [40.4%]; P < 0.001) and invasive ventilation (52 [31.3%] vs 32 [12.5%]; P < 0.001) and were more frequently admitted to the intensive care unit (70 [42.2%] vs 51 [20.0%]; P < 0.001) than seasonal influenza patients. Among immunocompromised patients, those in the COVID-19 group had a higher hospital mortality compared to those in the seasonal influenza group (13 [33.3%] vs 8 [11.6%], P = 0.01). In conclusion, we show that COVID-19 patients were younger and had fewer baseline comorbidities than seasonal influenza patients but were at increased risk for severe illness. The high mortality observed in immunocompromised COVID-19 patients emphasizes the importance of protecting these patient groups from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Brehm, Thomas Theo; van der Meirschen, Marc; Hennigs, Annette; Roedl, Kevin; Jarczak, Dominik; Wichmann, Dominic; Frings, Daniel; Nierhaus, Axel; Oqueka, Tim; Fiedler, Walter; Christopeit, Maximilian; Kraef, Christian; Schultze, Alexander; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Addo, Marylyn M; Schmiedel, Stefan; Kluge, Stefan; Schulze zur Wiesch, Julian",Sci Rep,393,16

An online survey comprised of 49 closed and open-ended questions was distributed by the Academy of Neurologic Music Therapy to 2,778 NMT affiliates worldwide. The survey sought information on demographics, telehealth perceptions, technology, assessment, clinical practice, safety, and caregiver involvement. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were applied. Eighty-one participants answered the survey and the 69 who completed the survey in its entirety were included in the analysis. Results indicated that the frequency of NMT technique usage had no impact on the overall number of clinical hours retained over telehealth. Correlation analysis revealed an association between more frequent NMT usage and perceived likelihood of using telehealth in the future (i.e., once COVID-19 is no longer a major threat), as well as with fewer group sessions lost over telehealth. All NMT domains transferred to telehealth, although within the sensorimotor domain, fewer therapists implemented rhythmic auditory stimulation for telehealth sessions compared to in-person. Overall, NMTs had fewer hours for telehealth compared to in-person regardless of employment setting. Technological challenges were notable drawbacks, while major benefits included the ability to continue providing NMT when in-person sessions were not possible, increased accessibility for remote clients, and positive outcomes related to increased caregiver involvement. Based on the results, our recommendations for implementing telehealth in Neurologic Music Therapy include integrating telehealth into routine care, mitigating safety concerns, identifying those who could benefit most from remote delivery, involving caregivers, and developing/sharing resources for telehealth NMT.","Cole, Lauren Patricia; Henechowicz, Tara Lynn; Kang, Kyurim; Pranjić, Marija; Richard, Nicole Marie; Tian, Gloria L.

Methods: We surveyed 1326 students during 2018 and 2019, and compared their responses with 531 students enrolled in May 2020. Perceived stress, quality of life (QoL), happiness, anxiety, and optimism were assessed as proxies of psychological well-being, using general linear modelling. Results: We found no substantial differences in dietary pattern between pre-lockdown and lockdown periods, including the overall Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence. However, the MD pattern changed, showing increased adherence to the MD pyramid for fruit, legumes, fish, and sweets, while cereals, nuts, and dairy intake decreased during COVID-19 lockdown. A third of students reported weight loss during lockdown, 19% reported weight gain, while physical activity remained rather stable. The most prominent change was feeling refreshed after a night’s sleep, reported by 31.5% of students during lockdown vs. 8.5% before; median length of sleep duration increased by 1.5 h. Lockdown significantly affected QoL, happiness, optimism (all p < 0.001), and perceived stress in students (p = 0.005). MD adherence was positively correlated with QoL and study time, and negatively with TV and mobile phone use in pre-lockdown period (all p < 0.001). Interestingly, higher MD adherence was correlated with less perceived hardship and greater happiness and QoL during lockdown. Conclusion: These insights provide valuable information for tailored interventions aimed at maintaining healthy lifestyle in young population. Given the numerous beneficial effects associated with MD adherence, modification of lifestyle through application of lifestyle medicine deserves a priority approach.","Dragun, Ružica; Veček, Nikolina Nika; Marendić, Mario; Pribisalić, Ajka; Đivić, Gabrijela; Cena, Hellas; Polašek, Ozren; Kolčić, Ivana",Nutrients,393,24

Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected by RT-qPCR, the molecular-level quantification of the viral load is still challenging, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. Here, we report an ultrasensitive hyperspectral sensor (HyperSENSE) based on hafnium nanoparticles (HfNPs) for specific detection of COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Density functional theoretical calculations reveal that HfNPs exhibit higher changes in their absorption wavelength and light scattering when bound to their target SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence relative to the gold nanoparticles. The assay has a turnaround time of a few seconds and has a limit of detection in the yoctomolar range, which is 1 000 000-fold times higher than the currently available COVID-19 tests. We demonstrated in ∼100 COVID-19 clinical samples that the assay is highly sensitive and has a specificity of 100%. We also show that HyperSENSE can rapidly detect other viruses such as influenza A H1N1. The outstanding sensitivity indicates the potential of the current biosensor in detecting the prevailing presymptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. Thus, integrating hyperspectral imaging with nanomaterials establishes a diagnostic platform for ultrasensitive detection of COVID-19 that can potentially be applied to any emerging infectious pathogen.","Alafeef, Maha; Moitra, Parikshit; Dighe, Ketan; Pan, Dipanjan",ACS Nano,393,33

The study team sought to compare real-time assay results with panspecies conventional molecular diagnostics to compare sensitivities and learn if novel viruses had been missed. METHODS: Specimens were studied for evidence of adenovirus (AdV), enterovirus (EV) and coronavirus (CoV) with panspecies gel-based nested PCR/RT-PCR assays. Gene sequences of specimens positive by panspecies assays were sequenced and studied with the NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool software. RESULTS: There was considerable discordance between real-time and conventional molecular methods. The real-time AdV assay found a positivity of 10.4%; however, the AdV panspecies assay detected a positivity of 12.4% and the conventional AdV-Hexon assay detected a positivity of 19.6%. The CoV and EV panspecies assays similarly detected more positive specimens than the real-time assays, with a positivity of 7.8% by the CoV panspecies assay versus 4.2% by rRT-PCR, and 8.0% by the EV panspecies assay versus 1.0% by rRT-PCR. We were not able to ascertain virus viability in this setting. While most discordance was likely due to assay sensitivity for previously described human viruses, two novel, possible zoonotic AdV were detected.

Hence, this review was undertaken to analyse the available evidence on bioaerosols in OSPs, and their significance in COVID-19 transmission. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv and Lancet preprint databases for studies on bioaerosols in OSPs. Random-effects metanalysis was conducted to determine pooled estimates of key bioaerosol characteristics. Risk of bias was assessed by the RoB-SPEO tool; overall strength of evidence was assessed by the GRADE approach. RESULTS: 17 studies were included in the systematic review, and 6 in different sets of meta-analyses. The pooled estimate of particle density was 390.74 μg/m(3), Total Particle Count, 6.08 × 10(6)/m(3), and Microbial Air Contamination, 8.08 CFU/m(3). Small sized particles (</ = 0.5 μm) were found to be 37 and 1604 times more frequent in the aerosol cloud in comparison to medium and large sized particles respectively. 4 studies reported that haemoglobin could be detected in aerosols, and one study showed that HIV could be transmitted by blood aerosolized by electric saw and burr. The risk of bias for all studies in the review was determined to be high, and the quality of evidence, low. CONCLUSION: Whereas there is evidence to suggest that OSPs generate large amounts of bioaerosols, their potential to transmit infectious diseases like COVID-19 is questionable. High-quality research, as well as consensus minimum reporting guidelines for bioaerosol research in OSPs is the need of the hour.","Sharma, Siddhartha; John, Rakesh; Patel, Sandeep; Neradi, Deepak; Kishore, Kamal; Dhillon, Mandeep S.",J Clin Orthop Trauma,393,28

In this study, we aimed to characterize the respiratory specimens associated with inconclusive SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay results. METHODS: We re-evaluated inconclusive specimens by 3 additional RT-PCR assays and attempted to detect subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) in these specimens. RESULTS: Among follow-up tests from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, 36.3% of the inconclusive results were classified as presumptive positive results (45/124). However, none of the specimens from 36 screening cases was classified as a presumptive positive result. Among 160 inconclusive specimens, sgRNAs were detected in 78 samples (48.8%): 58 were confirmed cases (58/124, 46.8%) and 20 were screening cases (20/36, 55.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest the recommendation of considering inconclusive results as positive results for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. In screening cases, viral remnants could be partially amplified in PCR assays, and these inconclusive results could be related to previous infections. In addition, sgRNAs were detected in about half of the inconclusive specimens; however, the clinical significance of sgRNA is not yet clear.

Replication of the viral genome is a fundamental step in the virus life cycle and SARS‐CoV‐2 non‐structural protein 9 (Nsp9) is shown to be essential for virus replication through its ability to bind RNA in the closely related SARS‐CoV‐1 strain. Two recent studies revealing the three‐dimensional structure of Nsp9 from SARS‐CoV‐2 have demonstrated a high degree of similarity between Nsp9 proteins within the coronavirus family. However, the binding affinity to RNA is very low which, until now, has prevented the determination of the structural details of this interaction. In this study, we have utilized nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) in combination with surface biolayer interferometry (BLI) to reveal a distinct binding interface for both ssDNA and RNA that is different to the one proposed in the recently solved SARS‐CoV‐2 replication and transcription complex (RTC) structure.

Moreover, since existing drug repositioning methods provide limited usable information for de novo drug design, we extracted and prioritized the chemical substructures of the identified drugs, providing a chemical vocabulary that may help to design new effective drugs.","Serra, Angela; Fratello, Michele; Federico, Antonio; Ojha, Ravi; Provenzani, Riccardo; Tasnadi, Ervin; Cattelani, Luca; del Giudice, Giusy; Kinaret, Pia Anneli Sofia; Saarimäki, Laura Aliisa; Pavel, Alisa; Cerullo, Vincenzo; Vapalahti, Olli; Horvarth, Peter; Di Lieto, Antonio; Yli-Kauhaluoma, Jari; Balistreri, Giuseppe; Greco, Dario",bioRxiv,393,33

However, systemic inequities and disparities exacerbated the pandemic’s effect on racial and ethnic groups (Tai 72:703–706, 2021). The exact impact of the pandemic within the Middle Eastern North African (MENA) community is not well documented or understood due to the lack of federal recognition of MENAs as an ethnic group. Given the lack of COVID-19 research among this community, this study was created to address COVID-19 needs, perceptions, and health-seeking behaviors regarding COVID-19 precautions, mask wearing, and routine healthcare appointments. Between June and July 2020, an anonymous survey was distributed in English and Arabic using a Community Participatory Based Research design in Dearborn, Michigan. Overall, 298 individuals were surveyed and their misconceptions regarding COVID-19 infections, spread, and precautions were identified. It is important to note that about 75% of survey respondents identified as female, while only 24% of survey participants identified as male. Survey participants slightly underestimated the distance in which COVID-19 can be transmitted as 5.5 ± 3.5. Participants severely underestimated COVID-19 deaths in the US, with 23% estimating that under 250,000 individuals would die from COVID-19. Overall, 60% of participants reported that they did not have any difficulty adhering to COVID-19 precautions and self-quarantine rules during Ramadan, while this number dropped to only 36% (87/238) after Ramadan. The goal of this study was to serve as a tool to better understand the misconceptions, difficulties, and needs regarding COVID-19 among this understudied population. The MENA community may be particularly vulnerable to the economic, medical, and social changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ismail, Malak A.; Khalil, Marwa; Najdi, Roukaya; Blackwood, R.

It is a global public health concern that has resulted in the rapid growth in the number of infected patients with significant mortality rates. Hence, we conducted a retrospective study in Gadarif Hospital to evaluate the presenting manifestations, mortality rate, and the risk factors associated with mortality in hospitalized patients. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at Gadarif Hospital in Eastern Sudan. Medical files of the patients admitted during the period between April and July 2020 were reviewed. All the files of the adult patients (aged 18 or above), of both sexes, who had a confirmed COVID-19-positive status via laboratory testing using PCR and who were admitted during this period were reviewed. The data extracted included patients’ demographics and initial clinical presentation, symptoms, signs, and the laboratory and radiographic findings. The data were analyzed using SPSS v22. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were admitted with COVID-19. The median (interquartile) age was 62 (55.00–70.00) years old, and 72 (81.8%) of them were males. Most patients (75%) experienced a one-week duration of symptoms. A fever (87.5%), cough (80.68%), and shortness of breath (77.27%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Following a clinical assessment, both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure were found to be normal in most patients, at 92.05% and 89.77%, respectively. An oxygen saturation of less than 90% was seen in 71.59% of patients. The general mortality rate was 37.5% and most deaths occurred during the first 24 h of admission (21/33 [63.64%]). There was no significant difference in the death rate between females and males (5/16 [31.3%] vs 28/72 [38.9%], P = 0.776). There was no significant difference in the body mass index, tobacco use, or education level between the patients who died and those who survived. A logistic regression showed that being older (AOR = 1.05, 95% CI = [1.01, 1.10]) and having a lower PO(2) level (AOR = 1.11, 95% CI = [1.04, 1.16]) were associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: The general mortality rate was 37.5%, and the risk factors that could predict increased mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 positive cases included old age and a lower PO(2) level.","Omar, Saeed M; Musa, Imad R; Salah, Sami E; Elnur, Mohammed M; Al-Wutayd, Osama; Adam, Ishag",J Multidiscip Healthc,393,9

METHODS: A reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay targeting the P gene was developed in this study and used to detect hMPV in nasal and throat swabs collected from 2936 immunocompetent adult patients with ARTIs in Beijing, China between July 2008 and June 2010. RESULTS: Among the 2936 patients studied, 49 (1.7%) were positive for hMPV, of whom 14 (28.6%) were positive for hMPV_A2b, 19 (38.8%) for hMPV_B1, and 16 (32.6%) for hMPV_B2. hMPV_A1 was not detected. An average detection rate of 6.6% was observed in the peak months of the two epidemic seasons studied. The hMPV prevalence was higher in the sampled elderly (>65 years, 3.2%) than in middle aged adults (25–65 years; 2.0%) and teenagers (14–25 years; 0.9%). During the study period, hMPV infections showed a biennial rhythm of seasonality, peaking from November to March in 2008/09 and from March to June in 2010. CONCLUSION: hMPV infection plays an important role in immunocompetent adults in its epidemic season. The demographic and clinical data presented in this study improves our understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical burden of hMPV infection in adults.","Li, Jianguo; Wang, Zhong; Gonzalez, Richard; Xiao, Yan; Zhou, Hongli; Zhang, Jing; Paranhos-Baccala, Glaucia; Vernet, Guy; Jin, Qi; Wang, Jianwei; Hung, Tao",J Infect,393,16

Alterations in ACE2 gene and protein expression, and activity mediated by A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), a member of the “A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease” (ADAM) family are implicated in several cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. We previously reported that activation of kinin B1 receptor (B1R) in the brain increases neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and sympathoexcitation, leading to the development of neurogenic hypertension. We also showed evidence for ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding in neurons. However, whether kinin B1 receptor (B1R) activation has any role in altering ADAM17 activity and its effect on ACE2 shedding in neurons is not known. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that activation of B1R upregulates ADAM17 and results in ACE2 shedding in neurons. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated wild-type and B1R gene-deleted mouse neonatal primary hypothalamic neuronal cultures with a B1R-specific agonist and measured the activities of ADAM17 and ACE2 in neurons. B1R stimulation significantly increased ADAM17 activity and decreased ACE2 activity in wild-type neurons, while pretreatment with a B1R-specific antagonist, R715, reversed these changes. Stimulation with specific B1R agonist Lys-Des-Arg(9)-Bradykinin (LDABK) did not show any effect on ADAM17 or ACE2 activities in neurons with B1R gene deletion. These data suggest that B1R activation results in ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding in primary hypothalamic neurons. In addition, stimulation with high concentration of glutamate significantly increased B1R gene and protein expression, along with increased ADAM17 and decreased ACE2 activities in wild-type neurons. Pretreatment with B1R-specific antagonist R715 reversed these glutamate-induced effects suggesting that indeed B1R is involved in glutamate-mediated upregulation of ADAM17 activity and ACE2 shedding.","Parekh, Rohan Umesh; Sriramula, Srinivas",Int J Mol Sci,393,1

We sought to further this research and to understand the impact of the stay-at-home order on crashes in the post order period in Connecticut. METHODS: We used a multiple-comparison group, interrupted time-series analysis design to compare crashes per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per week in 2020 to the average of 2017–2019 from January 1-August 31. We stratified crash rate by severity and the number of vehicles involved. We modeled two interruption points reflecting the weeks Connecticut implemented (March 23rd, week 12) and rescinded (May 20th, week 20) its stay-at-home order. RESULTS: During the initial week of the stay-at-home order in Connecticut, there was an additional 28 single vehicle crashes compared to previous years (95% confidence interval (CI): [15.8, 36.8]). However, the increase at the order onset was not seen throughout the duration. Rescinding the stay-at-home order by and large did not result in an immediate increase in crash rates. Crash rates steadily returned to previous year averages during the post-stay-at-home period. Fatal crash rates were unaffected by the stay-at-home order and remained similar to previous year rates throughout the study duration. DISCUSSION: The initial onset of the stay-at-home order in Connecticut was associated with a sharp increase in the single vehicle crash rate but that increase was not sustained for the remainder of the stay-at-home order. Likely changes in driver characteristics during and after the order kept fatal crash rates similar to previous years.","Doucette, Mitchell L.; Tucker, Andrew; Auguste, Marisa E.; Gates, Jonathan D.; Shapiro, David; Ehsani, Johnathon P.; Borrup, Kevin T.",Accid Anal Prev,393,24

The G cistron is 2045 nucleotides (nt) long and the G protein mRNA open reading frame (ORF), as determined from the cDNA sequence, contains 1896 nt and encodes a protein of 632 amino acids. Immunoblots with antibodies elicited against the purified glycoprotein from virus particles reacted with a fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli, indicating that the cloned ORF encodes the G protein. The 5′ end of the G protein mRNA corresponds to nt 5111, relative to the 3′ end of the viral (minus sense) genome, as determined by primer extension from mRNA isolated from infected plants, and extends to nt position 7155 on the genomic RNA. A 34-nt untranslated 5′ leader sequence and a 115-nt untranslated 3′ end flank the ORF on the mRNA. The gene junctions on either side of the G gene on the genomic RNA are identical to those previously described for other SYNV genes and are similar to sequences separating genes of animal rhabdoviruses. The predicted molecular weight of the G protein is 70,215 Da, a value less than the 77,000 Da estimated for the glycosylated G protein from virus particles. The deduced amino acid sequence of the SYNV G protein shares little direct relatedness with the G proteins of other rhabdoviruses, but appears to contain a similar signal sequence, a transmembrane anchor domain, and glycosylation signals. In addition, the SYNV G protein contains a putative nuclear targeting site near the carboxy terminus, which may be involved in transit to the nuclear membrane prior to morphogenesis.","Goldberg, Karen-Beth; Modrell, Brett; Hillman, Bradley I.; Heaton, Louis A.; Choi, Tae-Jin; Jackson, A.

Participants: 29,293,845 adults (47% male) aged 30-100 years (mean age = 56) present at the 2011 Census who were alive on 24 January 2020. The main exposure was self-reported disability from the 2011 Census. Main outcome measures: Death involving COVID-19, occurring between 24 January 2020 and 28 February 2021. We estimated the age-standardised mortality rate per 100,000 person-years at-risk, stratified by sex, disability status, and wave of the pandemic. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for disabled people compared with non-disabled people, adjusted for geographical factors, socio-demographic characteristics, and pre-pandemic health conditions. Results: Disabled people made up 17% of the study population, including 7% who were 'more-disabled' and 10% 'less-disabled'. From 24 January 2020 to 28 February 2021, 105,213 people died from causes involving COVID-19 in England, 58% of whom were disabled. Age-adjusted analyses showed that, compared to non-disabled people, mortality involving COVID-19 was higher among both more-disabled people (HR=3.05, 95% CI: 2.98 to 3.11 in males; 3.48, 3.41 to 3.56 in females) and less-disabled people (HR=1.88, 95% CI: 1.84 to 1.92 in males; 2.03, 1.98 to 2.08 in females). Among people aged 30-69, HRs reached 8.47 (8.01 to 8.95) among more-disabled females and 5.42 (5.18 to 5.68) for more-disabled males. Sequential adjustment for residence type, geography, socio-demographics, and health conditions partly explained the associations, indicating that a combination of these factors contributed towards the increased risk. Conclusion: Disabled people in England had markedly increased risk of mortality involving COVID-19 compared to non-disabled people and should be prioritised within the pandemic response.","Bosworth, M.

We aimed to study the transmission dynamics of SARS‐CoV‐2 within families with children in Greece. METHODS: We studied 23 family clusters of COVID‐19. Infection was diagnosed by RT‐PCR in respiratory specimens. The level of viral load was categorized as high, moderate, or low based on the cycle threshold values. RESULTS: There were 109 household members (66 adults and 43 children). The median attack rate per cluster was 60% (range: 33.4%‐100%). An adult member with COVID‐19 was the first case in 21 (91.3%) clusters. Transmission of infection occurred from an adult to a child in 19 clusters and/or from an adult to another adult in 12 clusters. There was no evidence of child‐to‐adult or child‐to‐child transmission. In total 68 household members (62.4%) tested positive. Children were more likely to have an asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection compared to adults (40% versus 10.5%, p‐value=0.021). In contrast, adults were more likely to develop a severe clinical course compared to children (8.8% versus 0%, p‐value=0.021). In addition, infected children were significantly more likely to have a low viral load while adults were more likely to have a moderate viral load (40.7% and 18.5% versus 13.8% and 51.7%, respectively; p‐value=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: While children become infected by SARS‐CoV‐2, they do not appear to transmit infection to others. Furthermore, children more frequently have an asymptomatic or mild course compared to adults. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of viral load on these findings.

When compared to controls, tPA-Bolus patients’ PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 48hours[16.9%(-8.3–36.8) vs 29.8%(4.5–88.7),p=0.11], COMPOSITE outcome (11.8% vs 47.4%,p=0.03), VFD[0.0(0.0–9.0) vs 12.0(0.0–19.0),p=0.11] and in-hospital mortality(41.2% vs 21.1%,p=0.19) did not reach statistically significant differences. tPA-Drip patients did not experience benefit. Interpretation The combination tPA-Bolus+heparin is safe in severe COVID-19 respiratory failure. A Phase 3 study is warranted given improvements in oxygenation and promising observations in VFD and mortality.","Barrett, Christopher D.; Moore, Hunter B.; Moore, Ernest E.; Wang, D.

In this manuscript, we prove that the method of using the cumulative CFR is static and does not reflect the trend according to the daily change per unit of time. METHODS: A proportion meta-analysis was carried out on CFR in every country reporting COVID-19 cases. Based on the results, we performed a meta-analysis for global COVID-19 CFR. Each analysis was performed on two different calculations of CFR: according to calendar date and according to days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case. We thus explored an innovative and original calculation of CFR concurrently based on the date of the first confirmed case as well as on a daily basis. RESULTS: For the first time, we showed that using meta-analyses, according to calendar date and days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case were different. CONCLUSION: We propose that CFR according to days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case might be a better predictor of the current CFR of COVID-19 and its kinetics.","Abou Ghayda, Ramy; Lee, Keum Hwa; Han, Young Joo; Ryu, Seohyun; Hong, Sung Hwi; Yoon, Sojung; Jeong, Gwang Hun; Lee, Jinhee; Lee, Jun Young; Yang, Jae Won; Effenberger, Maria; Eisenhut, Michael; Kronbichler, Andreas; Solmi, Marco; Li, Han; Jacob, Louis; Koyanagi, Ai; Radua, Joaquim; Shinc, Jae Il; Smith, Lee",Int J Infect Dis,393,19

Recent contaminations suggest these tests may not be sufficient. Assay sensitivity was not the issue for these contaminations that were caused by viruses/virus families not represented in the 9CFR screen. A detailed literature search was undertaken to determine which viruses that infect cattle or swine or bovine or porcine cells in culture also have human host range [ability to infect humans or human cells in culture] and to predict their detection by the currently used 9CFR procedures. There are more viruses of potential risk to biological products manufactured using bovine or porcine raw materials than are likely to be detected by 9CFR testing procedures; even within families, not all members would necessarily be detected.

The typical symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath, evolving to a clinical picture of pneumonia and, ultimately, death. Nausea and diarrhea are equally frequent, suggesting viral infection or transmission via the gastrointestinal-enteric system. SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells by using angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, which is cleaved by transmembrane proteases during host cells infection, thus reducing its activities. ACE2 is a relevant player in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), counterbalancing the deleterious effects of angiotensin II. Furthermore, intestinal ACE2 functions as a chaperone for the aminoacid transporter B(0)AT1. It has been suggested that B(0)AT1/ACE2 complex in the intestinal epithelium regulates gut microbiota (GM) composition and function, with important repercussions on local and systemic immune responses against pathogenic agents, namely virus. Notably, productive infection of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE2(+) mature human enterocytes and patients’ GM dysbiosis was recently demonstrated. This review outlines the evidence linking abnormal ACE2 functions with the poor outcomes (higher disease severity and mortality rate) in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing age-related comorbidities and addresses a possible role for GM dysbiosis. The article culminates with the therapeutics opportunities based on these pathways.","Viana, Sofia D.; Nunes, Sara; Reis, Flávio",Ageing Res Rev,393,22

ACE2 is homologous with, but acts antagonistically to, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and has the critical function of protecting the lungs. ACE inhibitors are major antihypertensive agents. Thus, we aimed to analyze the impact of the prevalence of preexisting hypertension on the local spread of coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: Data on SARS-CoV-2 infection and the estimated number of patients who received medical treatment based on disease classification using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, in each prefecture were obtained from the official Japanese notifications database. We analyzed the association between the proportion of patients with each disease and SARS-CoV-2-infection prevalence. RESULTS: The ratio of patients treated for diseases of the circulatory system, especially hypertensive disorders, per population demonstrated the most significant negative correlation with SARS-CoV-2-infection prevalence (Spearman’s rank correlation, p < 0.01). Age group analysis revealed a significant negative correlation in age groups 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 75–84, and ≥85.

The extent to which organizational changes impacted the mental wellbeing of healthcare workers (HCWs) remains unexplored. Here we analyzed the association between three work-related stressors (reported access to protective equipment, change in job functions, and patient prioritization decision-making) and mental health outcomes (depression symptoms, psychological distress, suicidal thoughts, and fear of infection) in a large sample of Spanish HCWs during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: : We conducted a cross-sectional study including HCWs from three regions of Spain between April 24(th) and June 22(nd), 2020. An online survey measured sociodemographic characteristics, work-related stressors, fear of infection, and mental health outcomes (depression [PHQ-9], psychological distress [GHQ-12], death wishes [C-SSRS]). We conducted mixed-effects regression models to adjust all associations for relevant individual- and region-level sources of confounding. RESULTS: : We recruited 2,370 HCWs. Twenty-seven percent screened positive for depression and 74% for psychological distress. Seven percent reported death wishes. Respondents were more afraid of infecting their loved ones than of getting infected themselves. All work-related stressors were associated with depression symptoms and psychological distress in adjusted models. LIMITATIONS: : Non-probabilistic sampling, potential reverse causation. CONCLUSIONS: : Modifiable work-related stressors are associated with worse mental health among HCWs. Our results suggest that workplace prevention strategies for HCWs should provide sufficient protective equipment, minimize changes in job functions, favor the implementation of criteria for patient triage and on-call bioethics committees, and facilitate access to stepped-care, evidence-based mental health treatment.","Mediavilla, Roberto; Fernández-Jiménez, Eduardo; Martínez-Alés, Gonzalo; Moreno-Küstner, Berta; Martinez-Morata, Irene; Jaramillo, Fabiola; Morán-Sánchez, Inés; Minué, Sergio; Torres-Cantero, Alberto; Alvarado, Rubén; Ayuso-Mateos, José Luis; Mascayano, Franco; Susser, Ezra; Bravo-Ortiz, María-Fe",J Affect Disord,393,28

However, these significantly affect the quality of mothers’ lives. Little is known about the level of quality-of-life and associated factors among postpartum women in Ethiopia, particularly in the study area. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 409 randomly selected post-partum women who were living in Arba Minch town. Systematic random sampling was employed to select the study participants. The standard quality-of-life assessment tool which is known as the short-form SF 36 tool was used to assess health-related quality-of-life. The logistic regression model was used to identify associated factors. Statistically significant variables at a p-value<0.25 in the bi-variable analysis were candidate variables for multi-variable analysis and statistical significance which was declared at a p-value<0.05. RESULTS: Among the study participants, 255 (62.3%) had lower level health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). About 46.2% of the study participants had lower physical HRQoL and about 79% of the study participants had lower mental HRQoL. The overall mean score of HRQoL was 45.15 (±8.13). Factors associated with lower overall HRQoL were age group 17–24 years (AOR=2.73, 95% CI=1.22–6.10), no formal education [AOR 2.02, 95% CI (1.05–3.89)], and cesarean delivery (AOR=0.49, 95% CI=0.24–0.97). A factor associated with lower physical HRQoL was cesarean delivery (AOR=0.34, 95% CI=0.13–0.88). Factors associated with lower mental HRQoL were age group 17–24 (AOR=3.37, 95% CI=1.60–7.04), not receiving antenatal care (AOR=3.65, 95% CI=1.45–9.16), and having postpartum depression (AOR=2.27, 95% CI=1.30–3.93). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the majority of post-partum women had a lower HRQoL, particularly women’s mental health was compromised. In this study, a suggestion is made that the respective bodies need to give particular attention to mothers during the post-partum period to prevent poor quality-of-life.","Tola, Yirgalem; Ayele, Gistane; Boti, Negussie; Yihune, Manaye; Gethahun, Firdawek; Gebru, Zeleke",Int J Womens Health,393,16

This report quantifies test bias by modeling observed CFR as log-log-linear function of test density (tests per population) in 163 countries. CFR declined almost 20% (e.g. from 5% to 4%) for each doubling of test density (p < 0.0001); this association did not vary by continent (interaction p > 0.10) although at any given test density CFR was higher in Europe or North America than in Asia or Africa. This effect of test density on observed CFR is adequate to hide all but the largest true differences in case survivorship. Published estimates of CFR should specify test density, and comparisons should correct for it such as by applying the provided model.","Smith, Maia P.",J Epidemiol Glob Health,393,30

This longitudinal study investigated how parental employment status (i.e., job loss and WFH) influenced adolescents' daily affect indirectly through family functioning (i.e., parent-adolescent conflict and parental warmth) and whether these links varied by family's socioeconomic status. METHODS: Daily-diary approaches were used to collect dyadic parent-adolescent data from a nationwide American sample (6,524 daily assessments from 447 parent-adolescent dyads; 45% black, 36% white, 10% Latinx, 7% Asian American, 2% Native American) over the course of 15 consecutive days at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Parents who experienced job loss demonstrated increases in parent-child conflict, which in turn predicted decreases in child positive affect and increases in child negative affect. Furthermore, parents' WFH status predicted increases in parental warmth, which in turn predicted increases in child positive affect and decreases in child negative affect. Parents of low-income families were more likely to experience job loss (24% vs. 13%) and less likely to WFH (44% vs. 73%) than middle-high income parents. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents from families facing economic hardship and employment shifts during COVID-19 experienced changes in parent-child relational dynamics that influenced their emotional well-being. Recognizing these shifts in family ecology is critical to health providers' ability to screen for mental health, assess existing family supports, and provide timely, targeted information about stress management and contending with family conflict.","Wang, Ming-Te; Henry, Daphne A.; Del Toro, Juan; Scanlon, Christina L.; Schall, Jacqueline D.",J Adolesc Health,393,27

Although extensive studies have been reported on the biology and pathogenesis of PDCoV, the mechanisms by which PDCoV enters cells are not well characterized. In this study, we investigated how PDCoV enters IPI-2I cells, a line of porcine intestinal epithelial cells derived from pig ileum. Immunofluorescence assays, siRNA interference, specific pharmacological inhibitors and dominant-negative mutation results revealed that PDCoV entry into IPI-2I cells depended on clathrin, dynamin and a low-pH environment, but was independent of caveolae. Specific inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) revealed that PDCoV entry involves macropinocytosis and depends on NHE rather than on PI3K. Additionally, Rab5 and Rab7, but not Rab11, regulated PDCoV endocytosis. This is the first study to demonstrate that PDCoV uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis as alternative endocytic pathways to enter porcine intestinal epithelial cells. We also discussed the entry pathways of PDCoV into other porcine cell lines. Our findings reveal the entry mechanisms of PDCoV and provide new insight into the PDCoV life cycle. IMPORTANCE An emerging enteropathogenic coronavirus, PDCoV has the potential for cross-species transmission, attracting extensive attenuation. Characterizing the detailed process of PDCoV entry into cells will deepen our understanding of the viral infection and pathogenesis, and provide the clues for therapeutic intervention against PDCoV. With the objective, we used complementary approaches to dissect the process in PDCoV-infected IPI-2I cells, a line of more physiologically relevant intestinal epithelial cells to PDCoV infection in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that PDCoV enters IPI-2I cells via macropinocytosis that does not require a specific receptor and clathrin-mediated endocytosis that requires a low-pH environment and dynamin, while a caveola-mediated endocytic pathway is used by PDCoV to enter swine testicular (ST) cells and porcine kidney (LLC-PK1) cells. These findings provide a molecular detail of the cellular entry pathways of PDCoV and may direct us toward novel antiviral drug development.","Fang, Puxian; Zhang, Jiansong; Zhang, Huichang; Xia, Sijin; Ren, Jie; Tian, Liyuan; Bai, Dongcheng; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo",J Virol,393,29

The pathophysiology of renal failure in this context is not fully understood, but likely to be multifactorial. The intensive care unit outcomes of patients following COVID-19 acute critical illness with associated AKI have not been fully explored. We conducted a cohort study to investigate the risk factors for acute kidney injury in patients admitted to and intensive care unit with COVID-19, its incidence and associated outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all patients admitted to our adult intensive care unit suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection from 14th March 2020 until 12th May 2020. Acute kidney injury was defined using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria. The outcome analysis was assessed up to date as 3rd of September 2020. RESULTS: A total of 81 patients admitted during this period. All patients had acute hypoxic respiratory failure and needed either noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilatory support. Thirty-six patients (44%) had evidence of AKI (Stage I-33%, Stage II-22%, Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)-44%). All patients with AKI stage III had RRT. Age, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, lymphopenia, high D-Dimer levels, increased APACHE II and SOFA scores, invasive mechanical ventilation and use of inotropic or vasopressor support were significantly associated with AKI. The peak AKI was at day 4 and mean duration of RRT was 12.5 days. The mortality was 25% for the AKI group compared to 6.7% in those without AKI. Among those received RRT and survived their illness, the renal function recovery is complete and back to baseline in all patients. CONCLUSION: Acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy is common in critically ill patients presenting with COVID-19. It is associated with increased severity of illness on admission to ICU, increased mortality and prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay. Recovery of renal function was complete in all survived patients.

In a public health response due to coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, the Italian government imposed a lockdown from March 9 to May 3. This extraordinary situation may have been challenging for maternal psychological health. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms in women giving birth during the Covid-19 pandemic and its associations with quarantine measures, obstetrical factors, and relational attachment style. METHODS: Women who gave birth in a high-volume obstetric/gynaecological medical centre located in an epidemic area during the Covid-19 pandemic (March 8 to June 15) were asked to complete an online survey about their childbirth experience and the perceived effect of the pandemic. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) were administered to assess levels of postpartum depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and relational style of attachment, respectively. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify associations between quarantine measures, childbirth experience, attachment style, and EPDS and IES-R scores. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 163 women (response rate 60.8%). The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 44.2% (EPDS cut-off score ≥ 11) and the PTSS rate was 42.9% (IES-R cut-off score ≥ 24). Dismissive and fearful avoidant attachment styles were significantly associated with the risk of depression and PTSS, respectively. Perceived pain during birth was a risk factor for postpartum depression. Perceived support provided by healthcare staff was a protective factor against depression and PTSS. Another protective factor against PTSS was quiet on the ward due to the absence of hospital visitors. CONCLUSION: This study reports a high prevalence of postpartum depressive and PTSS in women who gave birth during the Covid-19 pandemic. Postnatal psychological distress seemed to be associated more with the prenatal experience and other individual factors than with the pandemic hospital restrictions. Early detection during pregnancy of an insecure attachment style is fundamental to provide targeted preventive and therapeutic psychological interventions.

Policies to contain the pandemic have led to widespread economic problems, which likely increase stress and resulting health risk behaviors, particularly among women, who have been hardest hit both by job loss and caregiving responsibilities. Further, women with pre-existing disadvantage (e.g., those without health insurance) may be most at risk for stress and consequent health risk behavior. Our objective was to estimate the associations between financial stressors from COVID-19 and health risk behavior changes since COVID-19, with potential effect modification by insurance status. We used multilevel logistic regression to assess the relationships between COVID-19-related financial stressors (job loss, decreases in pay, trouble paying bills) and changes in health risk behavior (less exercise, sleep, and healthy eating; more smoking/vaping and drinking alcohol), controlling for both individual-level and zip code-level confounders, among 90,971 US women who completed an online survey in March–April 2020. Almost 40% of women reported one or more COVID-19-related financial stressors. Each financial stressor was significantly associated with higher odds of each type of health risk behavior change. Overall, reporting one or more financial stressors was associated with 56% higher odds (OR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.51, 1.60) of reporting two or more health risk behavior changes. This association was even stronger among women with no health insurance (OR = 2.46; 95% CI: 1.97, 3.07). COVID-19-related economic stress is thus linked to shifts in health risk behaviors among women, which may have physical health consequences for years to come. Further, the relationship between financial hardship and health risk behavior among women may be modified by health insurance status, as a marker for broader socioeconomic context and resources. The most socioeconomically vulnerable women are likely at highest risk for long-term health effects of COVID-19 financial consequences.","Sampson, Laura; Ettman, Catherine K.; Abdalla, Salma M.; Colyer, Elizabeth; Dukes, Kimberly; Lane, Kevin J.; Galea, Sandro",SSM Popul Health,393,20

Among nearly 1000 reported virus lineages, dominant lineages such as B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 attract media attention with questions regarding vaccine efficiency and transmission potential. In response to the pandemic, the Jena University Hospital began sequencing SARS-CoV-2 samples in Thuringia in early 2020. Methods: Viral RNA was sequenced in tiled amplicons using Nanopore sequencing. Subsequently, bioinformatic workflows were used to process the generated data. As a genomic background, 9,642 representative SARS-CoV-2 genomes (1,917 of German origin) were extracted from more than 300.000 genomes. Results: In a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, we have set Thuringian isolates in the German, European and global context. In Thuringia, a largely rural German region without an international airport and a population density below the German average, we discovered many of the common ""EU lineages"". German samples are scattered across eight major clades, and Thuringian samples occupy four of them. Conclusion: The rapid emergence and spread of novel variants are of great concern as these lineages could transmit more efficiently, evade current vaccine efforts or undermine diagnostic test accuracy. To anticipate and mitigate these threats, a continuous molecular surveillance is essential.","Brandt, C.; Spott, R.; Hoelzer, M.; Kuehnert, D.; Fuchs, S.; Lohde, M.; Marquet, M.; Viehweger, A.; Rimek, D.; Pletz, M.",,393,1

We studied whether use of NSAIDs was associated with adverse outcomes and mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using Danish administrative and health registries. We included individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the period 27 February 2020 to 29 April 2020. NSAID users (defined as individuals having filled a prescription for NSAIDs up to 30 days before the SARS-CoV-2 test) were matched to up to 4 non-users on calendar week of the test date and propensity scores based on age, sex, relevant comorbidities, and use of selected prescription drugs. The main outcome was 30-day mortality, and NSAID users were compared to non-users using risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs). Secondary outcomes included hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and acute renal replacement therapy. A total of 9,236 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive individuals were eligible for inclusion. The median age in the study cohort was 50 years, and 58% were female. Of these, 248 (2.7%) had filled a prescription for NSAIDs, and 535 (5.8%) died within 30 days. In the matched analyses, treatment with NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.82, p = 0.95; RD 0.1%, 95% CI −3.5% to 3.7%, p = 0.95), risk of hospitalization (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.53, p = 0.31; RD 3.3%, 95% CI −3.4% to 10%, p = 0.33), ICU admission (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.02, p = 0.90; RD 0.2%, 95% CI −3.0% to 3.4%, p = 0.90), mechanical ventilation (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.30, p = 0.72; RD 0.5%, 95% CI −2.5% to 3.6%, p = 0.73), or renal replacement therapy (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.09, p = 0.81; RD −0.2%, 95% CI −2.0% to 1.6%, p = 0.81). The main limitations of the study are possible exposure misclassification, as not all individuals who fill an NSAID prescription use the drug continuously, and possible residual confounding by indication, as NSAIDs may generally be prescribed to healthier individuals due to their side effects, but on the other hand may also be prescribed for early symptoms of severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Use of NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day mortality, hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or renal replacement therapy in Danish individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Passive immunotherapy via either convalescent plasma or mAbs has proven to be effective for other infectious agents. Following infection with MERS-CoV, common marmosets were treated with high titer hyperimmune plasma or the mAb m336, at 6 and 48 h post inoculation. Both treatments reduced signs of clinical disease, but reduction in viral loads in the respiratory tract were only found in the hyperimmune plasma group. A decrease in gross pathology was found only in the mAb-treated group, but no histological differences were observed between treated and control animals. While both hyperimmune plasma and the m336 treatments reduced the severity of disease in the common marmoset, neither treatment resulted in full protection against disease.","van Doremalen, Neeltje; Falzarano, Darryl; Ying, Tianlei; de Wit, Emmie; Bushmaker, Trenton; Feldmann, Friederike; Okumura, Atsushi; Wang, Yanping; Scott, Dana P.; Hanley, Patrick W.; Feldmann, Heinz; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.; Munster, Vincent J.",Antiviral Research,393,24

We have learned more about the intricacies that fine tune the activity of common players and ultimately shape the different types of cell death. These studies have highlighted the complex mechanisms tipping the balance between different cell fates. Here, we summarize the latest discoveries in the three most well understood modalities of cell death, namely, apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, highlighting common and unique pathways and their effect on the surrounding cells and the organism as a whole.","Bertheloot, Damien; Latz, Eicke; Franklin, Bernardo S.",Cell Mol Immunol,393,1

The best way to prevent the pandemic from spreading further is to use a vaccine against COVID-19. Here, we report the design of a recombinant multi-epitope vaccine against the four proteins spike or crown (S), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and envelope (E) of SARS-CoV-2 using immunoinformatics tools. We evaluated the most antigenic epitopes that bind to HLA class 1 subtypes, along with HLA class 2, as well as B cell epitopes. Beta-defensin 3 and PADRE sequence were used as adjuvants in the structure of the vaccine. KK, GPGPG, and AAY linkers were used to fuse the selected epitopes. The nucleotide sequence was cloned into pET26b(+) vector using restriction enzymes XhoI and NdeI, and HisTag sequence was considered in the C-terminal of the construct. The results showed that the proposed candidate vaccine is a 70.87 kDa protein with high antigenicity and immunogenicity as well as non-allergenic and non-toxic. A total of 95% of the selected epitopes have conservancy with similar sequences. Molecular docking showed a strong binding between the vaccine structure and tool-like receptor (TLR) 7/8. The docking, molecular dynamics, and MM/PBSA analysis showed that the vaccine established a stable interaction with both structures of TLR7 and TLR8. Simulation of immune stimulation by this vaccine showed that it evokes immune responses related to humoral and cellular immunity.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, mediates the virus infection by binding to spike protein. Although ACE2 is expressed in the lung, kidney, and intestine, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. Considering the great infectivity of COVID-19, we speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may depend on other routes to facilitate its infection. Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification. Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment. Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice. Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient. Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab. Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis. Together, our study reveals a novel virus entry route, CD147-spike protein, which provides an important target for developing specific and effective drug against COVID-19.","Wang, Ke; Chen, Wei; Zhang, Zheng; Deng, Yongqiang; Lian, Jian-Qi; Du, Peng; Wei, Ding; Zhang, Yang; Sun, Xiu-Xuan; Gong, Li; Yang, Xu; He, Lei; Zhang, Lei; Yang, Zhiwei; Geng, Jie-Jie; Chen, Ruo; Zhang, Hai; Wang, Bin; Zhu, Yu-Meng; Nan, Gang; Jiang, Jian-Li; Li, Ling; Wu, Jiao; Lin, Peng; Huang, Wan; Xie, Liangzhi; Zheng, Zhao-Hui; Zhang, Kui; Miao, Jin-Lin; Cui, Hong-Yong; Huang, Min; Zhang, Jun; Fu, Ling; Yang, Xiang-Min; Zhao, Zhongpeng; Sun, Shihui; Gu, Hongjing; Wang, Zhe; Wang, Chun-Fu; Lu, Yacheng; Liu, Ying-Ying; Wang, Qing-Yi; Bian, Huijie; Zhu, Ping; Chen, Zhi-Nan",Signal Transduct Target Ther,393,2

The Yangon city indeed suffers much from PM-related air pollution. Recent research has interestingly been focused on the novel subject of changes in the air quality associated with the restrictive measures in place during the current coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The first case of COVID-19 in Myanmar was diagnosed on March 23, 2020. In this article, we report on our attempt to evaluate any effects of the COVID-19-restrictive measures on the ambient PM pollution in Yangon. METHODS: We measured the PM concentrations every second for 1 week on four occasions at three study sites with different characteristics; the first occasion was before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and the remaining three occasions were while the COVID-19-restrictive measures were in place, including Stay-At-Home and Work-From-Home orders. The Pocket PM(2.5) Sensor [PRO] designed by the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), Japan, in cooperation with Yaguchi Electric Co., Ltd., (Miyagi, Japan) was used for the measurement of the ambient PM(2.5) and PM(10) concentrations. RESULTS: The results showed that there was a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in both the PM(2.5) and PM(10) concentrations while the COVID-19-restrictive measures were in place as compared to the measured values prior to the pandemic. The city experienced a profound improvement in the PM-related air quality from the “unhealthy” category prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to the “good” category during the pandemic, when the restrictive measures were in place. The percent changes in the PM concentrations varied among the three study sites, with the highest percent reduction noted in a semi-commercial crowded area (84.8% for PM(2.5); 88.6% for PM(10)) and the lowest percent reduction noted in a residential quiet area (15.6% for PM(2.5); 12.0% for PM(10)); the percent reductions also varied among the different occasions during the COVID-19 pandemic that the measurements were made. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the restrictive measures which were in effect to combat the COVID-19 pandemic had a positive impact on the ambient PM concentrations. The changes in the PM concentrations are considered to be largely attributable to reduction in anthropogenic emissions as a result of the restrictive measures, although seasonal influences could also have contributed in part. Thus, frequent, once- or twice-weekly Stay-At-Home or Telework campaigns, may be feasible measures to reduce PM-related air pollution. When devising such an action plan, it would be essential to raise the awareness of public about the health risks associated with air pollution and create a social environment in which Telework can be carried out, in order to ensure active compliance by the citizens.","Aung, Win-Yu; Paw-Min-Thein-Oo; Thein, Zaw-Lin; Matsuzawa, Sadao; Suzuki, Takehiro; Ishigaki, Yo; Fushimi, Akihiro; Mar, Ohn; Nakajima, Daisuke; Win-Shwe, Tin-Tin",Environ Health Prev Med,393,1

Methods We use data gathered by the Georgian National Center for Disease Control on all polymerase chain reaction tests conducted (among symptomatic patients, through routine testing and contact tracing); hospitalization data for confirmed cases, and contact tracing data. We calculated the number of contacts per index case, the secondary attack rate (% contacts infected), and effective R number (new cases per index case), and used logistic regression to estimate how age, gender, and contact type affected transmission. Results Most contacts and transmission events were between family members. Contacts <40 years were less likely to be infected, while infected individuals >50 were more likely to die than younger patients.

We conducted this study intending to whether the automated quantitative CLEIA antigen test using a saliva sample is effective and valid for the diagnosis of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed and compared the diagnostic accuracy of both the automated quantitative CLEIA antigen test and real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) using a saliva sample from individuals suspected as having COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 305 samples were collected and tested in Aichi Medical University Hospital and affiliated facilities from December 2020 until January 2021 at our institute. Using reverse-transcription PCR as a reference, the AUROC of the automated quantitative CLEIA antigen test was 0.903 (95% confidential interval 0.845–0.962, p < 0.001).

We analysed the registry data from a region in northeastern Italy to assess the trends in IPF-related mortality during 2008–2019, to compare results of underlying vs. multiple cause of death analyses, and to describe the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020. We identified IPF (ICD-10 code J84.1) among the causes of death registered in 557,932 certificates in the Veneto region. We assessed time trends in annual age-standardized mortality rates by gender and age (40–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years). IPF was the underlying cause of 1310 deaths in the 2251 certificates mentioning IPF. For all age groups combined, the age-standardized mortality rate from IPF identified as the underlying cause of death was close to the European median (males and females: 3.1 and 1.3 per 100,000/year, respectively). During 2008–2019, mortality rates increased in men aged ≥85 years (annual percent change of 6.5%, 95% CI: 2.0, 11.2%), but not among women or for the younger age groups. A 72% excess of IPF-related deaths was registered in March–April 2020 (mortality ratio 1.72, 95% CI: 1.29, 2.24). IPF mortality was increasing among older men in northeastern Italy. The burden of IPF was heavier than assessed by routine statistics, since less than two out of three IPF-related deaths were directly attributed to this condition. COVID-19 was accompanied by a remarkable increase in IPF-related mortality.","Marcon, Alessandro; Schievano, Elena; Fedeli, Ugo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,393,16

METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed to identify cancer patients who received COVID-19 diagnosis within the single healthcare system and presented to the ED within 30 days of COVID-19 positive date between May 1 and December 31, 2020. RESULTS: In our 61 patients, the mean age was 72.5 years old, with 34% of patients (n = 21) on active cancer therapy and 66% (n = 40) on surveillance only. Most patients (n = 53) received their COVID-19 diagnosis within the ED, with 8 patients diagnosed prior to initial ED visit. The most common CT studies ordered within the ED were CT chest (n = 25), CT abdomen/pelvis (A/P) (n = 20), CT head (n = 8), and CT chest/abdomen/pelvis (C/A/P) (n = 7). COVID-19 findings were present on 33 scans, findings of worsening malignancy on 12 scans, and non-COVID non-cancer findings on 9 scans. Significant differences in CT severity score (p = 0.0001), indication for hospitalization (p = 0.026), length of hospitalization (p = 0.004), interventions (remdesivir, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor support) while hospitalized (p < 0.05), and mortality (p = 0.042) were found between the prior diagnosis and ED diagnosis groups. No such differences were found between the active treatment and surveillance groups. CONCLUSION: ED CT imaging findings in patients with cancer and COVID-19 are predominantly related to COVID-19 infection, rather than cancer history or anti-cancer therapy status.","Vos, Derek; Smith, Daniel A.; Martin, Sooyoung; Tirumani, Sree H.; Ramaiya, Nikhil H.",Emerg Radiol,393,1

Depression is common among people who self-harm and may be an underlying driver of self-harm behaviour. Self-harm is often repeated, and risk of repetition is highest immediately after an act of self-harm. Readily accessible brief talking therapies show promise in helping people who self-harm, but further evaluation of these approaches is needed. A brief talking therapy intervention for depression and self-harm has been designed for use in a community setting. This mixed methods feasibility study with repeated measures will examine the feasibility and acceptability of the Community Outpatient Psychological Engagement Service for Self-Harm (COPESS) for people with self-harm and depression in the community, compared to routine care. METHODS: Sixty participants with a history of self-harm within the last six months, who are also currently depressed, will be recruited to take part in a feasibility single-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be randomised 1:1 to receive COPESS plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Recruitment will be via General Practitioners (GP) and self-referral. Assessment of feasibility and acceptability will be assessed via quantitative and qualitative methods including measures of recruitment and retention to the feasibility trial, participants’ experience of therapy, completion/completeness of outcome measures at relevant time-points and completion of a service use questionnaire. DISCUSSION: The results will indicate whether it is feasible to conduct a definitive full trial to determine whether COPESS is a clinically and cost effective intervention for people who self-harm in the community. Qualitative and quantitative data will in addition help identify potential strengths and/or challenges of implementing brief community-based interventions for people who self-harm.

METHODS: The study included proteinuric (n = 30) and non-proteinuric (n = 30) patients diagnosed with mild/moderate COVID-19 infection between March and September 2020 and healthy individuals as a control group (n = 20). The uKIM-1, serum creatinine, cystatin C, spot urine protein, creatinine, and albumin levels of the patients were evaluated again after an average of 21 days. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) uKIM-1 level at the time of presentation was 246 (141–347) pg/mL in the proteinuric group, 83 (29–217) pg/mL in the non-proteinuric group, and 55 (21–123) pg/mL in the control group and significantly high in the proteinuric group than the others (p < 0.001). Creatinine and cystatin C were significantly higher in the proteinuric group than in the group without proteinuria, but none of the patients met the KDIGO-AKI criteria. uKIM-1 had a positive correlation with PCR, non-albumin proteinuria, creatinine, cystatin C, CRP, fibrinogen, LDH, and ferritin, and a negative correlation with eGFR and albumin (p < 0.05). In the multivariate regression analysis, non-albumin proteinuria (p = 0.048) and BUN (p = 0.034) were identified as independent factors predicting a high uKIM-1 level. After 21 ± 4 days, proteinuria regressed to normal levels in 20 (67%) patients in the proteinuric group. In addition, the uKIM-1 level, albuminuria, non-albumin proteinuria, and CRP significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support that the kidney is one of the target organs of the COVID-19 and it may cause proximal tubule injury even in patients that do not present with AKI or critical/severe COVID-19 infection.

Early detection of COVID-19 may significantly increase the rate of survival; thus, it is critical that the disease is detected early. Emerging technologies have been used to prevent, diagnose, and manage COVID-19 among the populace in the USA and globally. Numerous studies have revealed the growing implementation of novel engineered systems during the intervention at various points of the disease’s pathogenesis, especially as it relates to comorbidities and complications related to cardiovascular and respiratory organ systems. In this review, we provide a succinct, but extensive, review of the pathogenesis of COVID-19, particularly as it relates to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a viral entry point. This is followed by a comprehensive analysis of cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities of COVID-19 and novel technologies that are used to diagnose and manage hospitalized patients. Continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring systems, novel machine learning algorithms for rapidly triaging patients, various imaging modalities, wearable immunosensors, hotspot tracking systems, and other emerging technologies are reviewed. COVID-19 effects on the immune system, associated inflammatory biomarkers, and innovative therapies are also assessed. Finally, with emphasis on the impact of wearable and non-wearable systems, this review highlights future technologies that could help diagnose, monitor, and mitigate disease progression. Technologies that account for an individual’s health conditions, comorbidities, and even socioeconomic factors can drastically reduce the high mortality seen among many COVID-19 patients, primarily via disease prevention, early detection, and pertinent management.","Amin, Md Shahnoor; Wozniak, Marcin; Barbaric, Lidija; Pickard, Shanel; Yerrabelli, Rahul S.; Christensen, Anton; Coiado, Olivia C.",J Healthc Inform Res,393,32

In a field that has traditionally relied on an established system of mandatory and voluntary reporting of known infectious diseases by doctors and laboratories to governmental agencies, innovations in social media and so-called user-generated information could lead to faster recognition of cases of infectious disease. More direct access to such data could enable surveillance epidemiologists to detect potential public health threats such as rare, new diseases or early-level warnings for epidemics. But how useful are data from social media and the Internet, and what is the potential to enhance surveillance? The challenges of using these emerging surveillance systems for infectious disease epidemiology, including the specific resources needed, technical requirements, and acceptability to public health practitioners and policymakers, have wide-reaching implications for public health surveillance in the 21st century. Methods: This article divides public health surveillance into indicator-based surveillance and event-based surveillance and provides an overview of each. We did an exhaustive review of published articles indexed in the databases PubMed, Scopus, and Scirus between 1990 and 2011 covering contemporary event-based systems for infectious disease surveillance. Findings: Our literature review uncovered no event-based surveillance systems currently used in national surveillance programs. While much has been done to develop event-based surveillance, the existing systems have limitations. Accordingly, there is a need for further development of automated technologies that monitor health-related information on the Internet, especially to handle large amounts of data and to prevent information overload. The dissemination to health authorities of new information about health events is not always efficient and could be improved. No comprehensive evaluations show whether event-based surveillance systems have been integrated into actual epidemiological work during real-time health events. Conclusions: The acceptability of data from the Internet and social media as a regular part of public health surveillance programs varies and is related to a circular challenge: the willingness to integrate is rooted in a lack of effectiveness studies, yet such effectiveness can be proved only through a structured evaluation of integrated systems. Issues related to changing technical and social paradigms in both individual perceptions of and interactions with personal health data, as well as social media and other data from the Internet, must be further addressed before such information can be integrated into official surveillance systems.","VELASCO, EDWARD; AGHENEZA, TUMACHA; DENECKE, KERSTIN; KIRCHNER, GÖRAN; ECKMANNS, TIM",Milbank Quarterly,393,1

The findings suggest how both work-related and family-related identity change may occur when individuals are confronted with a multi-domain work-life shock event such as the pandemic. Further, the findings point to three identity responses to this event: work-life identity threat, work-life identity reflection, and work-life identity reconstruction. For most participants, the seven-week period resulted in significant and positive shifts in their work and family identities to better align with their internal beliefs rather than relying on societally imposed expectations about what it means to be a good parent and worker.","Hennekam, Sophie; Ladge, Jamie J.; Powell, Gary N.",J Vocat Behav,393,20

Traditional dental examinations, more than 300 million per year in the US, rely on person-to-person tactile examinations, pose challenges to infection control, and consume large quantities of advanced level personal protective equipment (PPE). Therefore, our long-term goal is to develop an innovative mDentistry (mDent) mode that takes these issues into account. This model supplements the traditional dental practice with virtual visits, supported by mobile devices such as mobile telephones, tablets, and wireless infrastructure. The mDent model leverages the advantages of digital mHealth tools, such as intraoral cameras, to deliver virtual oral examinations, treatment planning, and interactive oral health management, on a broad population basis. The conversion of the traditional dental examinations to mDent virtual examinations builds upon i) reliability of teledentistry that uses intraoral photos and live videos to make diagnostic decisions, and ii) a rapid advancement of mHealth tools utilization. OBJECTIVE In this pilot project, we design a two-stage implementation study to assess two critical components of the mDent model: virtual hygiene examination (eHygiene); and patient self-taken intraoral photos (SELFIE). Our specific aims are: i) Assess the acceptance and barriers of mDent eHygiene among patients and DHCP (AIM 1); ii) Assess the economic impact of mDent eHygiene (AIM 2); and iii) Assess patient's capability of generating intraoral photos using mHealth tools (exploratory AIM 3 SELFIE). METHODS This study will access the rich resources of the National Dental Practice-Based Research Network, recruit 12 dentists, 12 hygienists and 144 patients from 12 practices. For AIM 1 and 2, we will use role-specific questionnaires to collect quantitative data on eHygiene acceptance and economic impact. The questionnaire components include participant characteristics, system usability scale, dentist-patient communication scale, practice operation cost and patient opportunity cost. We will further conduct a series of iterative qualitative research activities using individual interviews to further elicit feedback and suggestion for changes in the mDent eHygiene model. For AIM 3, we will use mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative) to assess patient's capability of taking intra-oral photos, via analyzing obtained photos and recorded videos. RESULTS The study is supported by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, USA. This study received 'single' IRB approval launched in August, 2021. Data collection and analysis are expected to conclude by December 2021 and March 2022, respectively.

We performed an international prospective cohort study including patients undergoing elective surgery in October 2020. Isolation was defined as the period before surgery during which patients did not leave their house or receive visitors from outside their household. The primary outcome was postoperative pulmonary complications, adjusted in multivariable models for measured confounders. Pre-defined sub-group analyses were performed for the primary outcome. A total of 96,454 patients from 114 countries were included and overall, 26,948 (27.9%) patients isolated before surgery. Postoperative pulmonary complications were recorded in 1947 (2.0%) patients of which 227 (11.7%) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients who isolated pre-operatively were older, had more respiratory comorbidities and were more commonly from areas of high SARS-CoV-2 incidence and high-income countries. Although the overall rates of postoperative pulmonary complications were similar in those that isolated and those that did not (2.1% vs 2.0%, respectively), isolation was associated with higher rates of postoperative pulmonary complications after adjustment (adjusted OR 1.20, 95%CI 1.05-1.36, p = 0.005). Sensitivity analyses revealed no further differences when patients were categorised by: pre-operative testing; use of COVID-19-free pathways; or community SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. The rate of postoperative pulmonary complications increased with periods of isolation longer than 3 days, with an OR (95%CI) at 4-7 days or ≥ 8 days of 1.25 (1.04-1.48), p = 0.015 and 1.31 (1.11-1.55), p = 0.001, respectively. Isolation before elective surgery might be associated with a small but clinically important increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Longer periods of isolation showed no reduction in the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. These findings have significant implications for global provision of elective surgical care.","Collaborative, C. OVIDSurg GlobalSurg Collaborative",Anaesthesia (Lond.),393,16

METHODS: Residents in the Stanford dermatology residency program participated in an arts-based education session, repeated in the fall of 2018 and 2019, that included a rotation of observational exercises adapted from the Artful Thinking program through Harvard Project Zero. The 2018 session featured exercises on identification and understanding of visual observation, while the 2019 session featured exercises on perspectives and objectivity of visual observation. Participants completed preintervention, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up surveys in fall 2018 and a postintervention survey in fall 2019. RESULTS: Twenty-one residents participated in the 2018 education session and produced an adequate response rate (62%-90%) across surveys. At 3 months, five of 13 residents (39%) reported new use of art for mindfulness and stress reduction, 12 of 13 (92%) could recall an example of use of observation to improve patient communication, and four of 13 (31%) confirmed and described adjustments to their handoff technique. In 2019, 13 out of 18 participants (72%) completed the postintervention survey. Responses reinforced themes from the prior iteration but focused on perspective, objectivity, context, and uncertainty in observations. Respondents also identified additional arenas of communication to benefit from these observational techniques. DISCUSSION: Dermatology residents increased use of art for personal wellness and adjusted clinical communication strategies after a single arts-based education session. Annual repetition with novel exercises maintained engagement and yielded additional participant insights.","Kumar, Anusha M.; Lee, Gun Ho; Stevens, Laurel A.; Kwong, Bernice Y.; Nord, Kristin M.; Bailey, Elizabeth E.",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,393,5

This sudden change from traditional learning to 100% online learning may affect students' learning effectiveness, especially in experimental courses. However, there has been little discussion of experimental courses conducted entirely through online learning. To address this gap, the present study investigated factors affecting high school students' online learning ineffectiveness (OLI) in online experimental courses, particularly online science experimental courses. The role of gender was also explored to understand whether it affects participants' OLI. An ANOVA was conducted to analyze the data from a survey of 347 online learners in high schools. The results indicated that the number of online experimental courses and the duration of online hands-on learning were negatively related to the high school students' OLI. Meanwhile, the study found that the high school participants' OLI differed by gender, with female students more likely than males to have OLI in the context of online learning. The results of this study can provide a reference for teachers who conduct online experimental courses and wish to improve their online teaching, not only during the COVID-19 lockdown, but also in other pandemic periods.","Hong, Jon-Chao; Liu, Yue; Liu, Yinsheng; Zhao, Li",Front Psychol,393,8

The major and minor salivary glands and their secretions also represent and integral part of the protective mechanism of the oral cavity, and derangement of saliva production may lead to loss of integrity of the oral mucosa. Drug-induced abnormalities of taste sensation are also well-described phenomena occurring in man although human studies are necessary for the detection of these effects. Inflammation of the oral cavity may involve the buccal mucosa, the gingiva (gingivitis), the tongue (glossitis), and the peridontal tissues (peridontitis). Therapeutic agents can induce inflammatory lesions in the tongue. Moreover, a protective layer of mucus, a visco-elastic material containing high molecular weight glycoproteins produced by the major and minor salivary glands, covers the stratified squamous mucosa of the oral cavity. Salivary secretions also possess digestive enzyme activity although in herbivores and carnivores, it is usually low in contrast to high digestive enzyme activity in omnivorous species.","Greaves, Peter",Histopathology of Preclinical Toxicity Studies,393,20

Alaska includes many remote and isolated villages with small populations (ranging from 15 to >1,000 persons) that are accessible only by air from larger communities. Until rapid point-of-care testing became widely available, a primary challenge in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in rural Alaska was slow turnaround times for SARS-CoV-2 test results, attributable to the need to transport specimens to testing facilities. To provide more timely test results and isolation of cases, the Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation (YKHC) introduced Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag rapid antigen test (BinaxNOW) on November 9, 2020, in the rural Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region in southwestern Alaska. To evaluate the impact of implementing antigen testing, YKHC reviewed the results of 54,981 antigen and molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 performed in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta during September 15, 2020-March 1, 2021. Introduction of rapid, point-of-care testing was followed by a more than threefold reduction in daily SARS-CoV-2 case rates during approximately 1 month before the introduction of COVID-19 vaccination. The median turnaround time for SARS-CoV-2 test results decreased by >30%, from 6.4 days during September 15-November 8, 2020, to 4.4 days during November 9, 2020-March 1, 2021 (p<0.001).

AIM To describe changes in loneliness, mental health problems, and attendance to scheduled medical care before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING Telephone survey on a pre-existing cohort of older adults with multimorbidity in primary care. METHOD Mental health and health service utilisation outcomes were compared with the outcomes before the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong using paired t-tests, Wilcoxon's signed-rank test, and McNemar's test. Loneliness was measured by the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. The secondary outcomes (anxiety, depression, and insomnia) were measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder tool, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Appointments attendance data were extracted from a computerised medical record system. Sociodemographic factors associated with outcome changes were examined by linear regression and generalised estimating equations. RESULTS Data were collected from 583 older (≥60 years) adults. There were significant increases in loneliness, anxiety, and insomnia, after the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. Missed medical appointments over a 3-month period increased from 16.5% 1 year ago to 22.0% after the onset of the outbreak. In adjusted analysis, being female, living alone, and having >4 chronic conditions were independently associated with increased loneliness. Females were more likely to have increased anxiety and insomnia. CONCLUSION Psychosocial health of older patients with multimorbidity markedly deteriorated and missed medical appointments substantially increased after the COVID-19 outbreak.","Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan; Zhang, Dexing; Sit, Regina Wing Shan; Yip, Benjamin Hon Kei; Chung, Roger Yat-Nork; Wong, Carmen Ka Man; Chan, Dicken Cheong Chun; Sun, Wen; Kwok, Kin On; Mercer, Stewart W",The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,393,24

To address this issue, a new COVID-19 machine readable dataset known as COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) has been released. Based on this, our objective was to build a computable co-occurrence network embeddings to assist association detection amongst COVID-19 related biomedical entities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leveraging a Linked Data version of CORD-19 (i.e., CORD-19-on-FHIR), we first utilized SPARQL to extract co-occurrences among chemicals, diseases, genes, and mutations and build a co-occurrence network. We then trained the representation of the derived co-occurrence network using node2vec with four edge embeddings operations (L1, L2, Average, and Hadamard). Six algorithms (Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Multi-layer Perceptron) were applied to evaluate performance on link prediction. An unsupervised learning strategy was also developed incorporating the t-SNE and DBSCAN algorithms for case studies. RESULTS: Random Forest classifier showed the best performance on link prediction across different network embeddings. For edge embeddings generated using the Average operation, Random Forest achieved the optimal average precision of 0.97 and F1 score of 0.90. For unsupervised learning, 63 clusters were formed with silhouette score of 0.128. Significant associations were detected for five coronavirus infectious diseases in their corresponding subgroups. CONCLUSION: In this study, we constructed COVID-19-centered co-occurrence network embeddings. Results indicated that the generated embeddings were able to extract significant associations for COVID-19 and coronavirus infectious diseases.","Oniani, David; Jiang, Guoqian; Liu, Hongfang; Shen, Feichen",J Am Med Inform Assoc,393,5

Although the prevalence of the disease is moderately low, averaging about 40 cases per 100,000 people in high risk areas, it is a particularly devastating disease. It primarily affects young adults, is chronic, and has an unpredictable course. Most discouraging, the cause of the disease is not known and an effective treatment has not been identified. Recently, however, research has yielded some important findings concerning the etiology of MS. Much evidence now points to an immunological process as one of the major elements in the disease. It is also likely that an environmental influence, possibly an infectious process, may contribute to the disease. Finally, it is now certain that genetic makeup influences susceptibility to the disease. At present, the strongest evidence is for a polygenic effect, not the effect of a single gene or gene locus. This review will examine some of the possible immunologically mediated disease processes that could be involved in MS, especially those that could account for a role for infectious and genetic factors in the disease.","McFarland, Henry F.; Dhib-Jalbut, Suhayl",Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology,393,3

We detected robust IgM, IgG, and IgA antibody responses to a broad array of SARS-CoV-2 antigens at the time of acute infection and 2 and 4 months after acute infection in all participants. Notably, these antibody responses were associated with virus neutralizing activity that was still detectable 4 months after acute infection in 94% of children. Moreover, antibody responses and neutralizing activity in sera from children and adolescents were comparable or superior to those observed in sera from 24 adults with mild symptomatic infection.

We performed longitudinal antigen-specific T cell analyses in healthy individuals following mRNA vaccination. Vaccination induced rapid near-maximal antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses in all subjects after the first vaccine dose. CD8+ T cell responses developed gradually after the first and second dose and were variable. Vaccine-induced T cells had central memory characteristics and included both Tfh and Th1 subsets, similar to natural infection. Th1 and Tfh responses following the first dose predicted post-boost CD8+ T cell and neutralizing antibody levels, respectively. Integrated analysis of 26 antigen-specific T cell and humoral responses revealed coordinated features of the immune response to vaccination. Lastly, whereas booster vaccination improved CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects, the second vaccine dose had little effect on T cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals. Thus, longitudinal analysis revealed robust T cell responses to mRNA vaccination and highlighted early induction of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells.

MethodsA case of re-infection was observed in a Belgian nosocomial outbreak involving 3 patients and 2 health care workers. To distinguish re-infection from persistent infection and detect potential transmission clusters, whole genome sequencing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs of all individuals including the re-infection cases first episode. IgA, IgM, and IgG and neutralizing antibody responses were quantified in serum of all individuals, and viral infectiousness was measured in the swabs of the reinfection case. ResultsRe-infection was confirmed in a young, immunocompetent health care worker as viral genomes derived from the first and second episode belonged to different SARS-CoV-2 clades. The symptomatic re-infection occurred after an interval of 185 days, despite the development of an effective humoral immune response following symptomatic primary infection. The second episode, however, was milder and characterized by a fast rise in serum IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Although contact tracing and virus culture remained inconclusive, the health care worker formed a transmission cluster with 3 patients and showed evidence of virus replication but not of neutralizing antibodies in her nasopharyngeal swabs. ConclusionIf this case is representative of most Covid-19 patients, long-lived protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 might not be likely.","Selhorst, Philippe; Ierssel, Sabrina van; Michiels, Jo; MariÃ«n, Joachim; Bartholomeeusen, Koen; Dirinck, Eveline; Vandamme, Sarah; Jansens, Hilde; AriÃ«n, Kevin K.",,393,1

COVID-19 clinical presentation primarily affects the respiratory system causing bilateral pneumonia, but it is increasingly being recognized as a systemic disease, with neurologic manifestations reported in patients with mild symptoms but, most frequently, in those in a severe condition. Elderly individuals are at high risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 due to factors associated with aging and a higher prevalence of medical comorbidities and, therefore, they are more vulnerable to possible lasting neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairments. Several reports have described insomnia, depressed mood, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and cognitive impairment in a proportion of patients after discharge from the hospital. The potential mechanisms underlying these symptoms are not fully understood but are probably multifactorial, involving direct neurotrophic effect of SARS-CoV-2, consequences of long intensive care unit stays, the use of mechanical ventilation and sedative drugs, brain hypoxia, systemic inflammation, secondary effects of medications used to treat COVID-19 and dysfunction of peripheral organs. Chronic diseases such as dementia are a particular concern not only because they are associated with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality but also because COVID-19 further exacerbates the vulnerability of those with cognitive impairment. In patients with dementia, COVID-19 frequently has an atypical presentation with mental status changes complicating the early identification of cases. COVID-19 has had a dramatical impact in long-term care facilities, where rates of infection and mortality have been very high. Community measures implemented to slow the spread of the virus have forced to social distancing and cancelation of cognitive stimulation programs, which may have contributed to generate loneliness, behavioral symptoms and worsening of cognition in patients with dementia. COVID-19 has impacted the functioning of Memory Clinics, research programs and clinical trials in the Alzheimer’s field, triggering the implementation of telemedicine. COVID-19 survivors should be periodically evaluated with comprehensive cognitive and neuropsychiatric assessments, and specific mental health and cognitive rehabilitation programs should be provided for those suffering long-term cognitive and psychiatric sequelae.","Alonso-Lana, Silvia; Marquié, Marta; Ruiz, Agustín; Boada, Mercè",Front Aging Neurosci,393,1

Reston ebolavirus (REBOV) has caused several epizootics in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) but is not associated with any human disease. In late 2008, REBOV infections were identified in swine for the first time in the Philippines. METHODS: A total of 215 swine sera collected at two REBOV-affected farms in 2008, in Pangasinan and Bulacan, were tested for the presence of REBOV-specific antibodies using multiple serodiagnosis systems. A total of 98 swine sera collected in a non-epizootic region, Tarlac, were also tested to clarify the prevalence of REBOV infection in the general swine population in the Philippines. RESULTS: Some 70 % of swine sera at the affected farms were positive for REBOV antibodies in the multiple serodiagnosis systems. On the other hand, none of the swine sera collected in Tarlac showed positive reactions in any of the diagnosis systems. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of REBOV infection in swine in the affected farms in 2008 suggests that swine is susceptible for REBOV infection. The multiple serological assays used in the study are thought to be useful for future surveillance of REOBV infection in swine in the Philippines.","Sayama, Yusuke; Demetria, Catalino; Saito, Mariko; Azul, Rachel R; Taniguchi, Satoshi; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Yoshikawa, Tomoki; Iizuka, Itoe; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Kurane, Ichiro; Malbas, Fidelino F; Lupisan, Socorro; Catbagan, Davinio P; Animas, Samuel B; Morales, Rieldrin G; Lopez, Emelinda L; Dazo, Karen Rose C; Cruz, Magdalena S; Olveda, Remigio; Saijo, Masayuki; Oshitani, Hitoshi; Morikawa, Shigeru",BMC Vet Res,393,1

As an efficient way to facilitate this, we developed a collaborative regional site visit program: the Enhancing Local Industry Transitions through Exploration (ELITE) Consortium. Consortium members arrange half-day visits to local industry sites, thus providing companies and trainees the opportunity to meet and identify potential professional and career opportunities. Three different training institutions worked cooperatively in the development and maintenance of the program. The ELITE Consortium was developed with eight phased steps; guidelines and operating procedures were created for each of these steps and are provided along with sample materials for institutions interested in building similar programs. Methods: Prior to fully developing the program, trainee interests were evaluated via questionnaire. During program implementation and thereafter, program directors tracked attendance and collected career outcome data from publicly available sources to identify first job positions after training. Regression analyses and chi-squared analyses were used to examine site visit matches and career outcome data. Results: Analyses suggest a positive impact of site visits on postdoctoral and graduate trainees’ career outcomes at companies or institutions that match a similar sector (e.g., for-profit) and type (e.g., biotech, pharmaceutical, contract research organization). Despite a small sample size, evidence suggests an especially positive impact on trainees who organize site visits to companies compared with those who simply participate. Conclusions: The ELITE Consortium was successful in helping trainees explore and identify a multitude of career paths. Trainees attained employment either directly or in related companies and institutions visited by ELITE participants. The joint, three-institution, flexible nature of the ELITE Consortium positively impacts the program’s sustainability and reach.

We sought to meet this urgent need by developing and benchmarking a standardized protocol for the fecal detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We test three preservative conditions for their ability to yield detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA: OMNIgene-GUT, Zymo DNA/RNA shield kit, and the most common condition, storage without any preservative. We test these in combination with three extraction kits: the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, Zymo Quick-RNA Viral Kit, and MagMAX Viral/Pathogen Kit.

We identify that the Zymo DNA/RNA shield collection kit and the QiaAMP viral RNA mini kit yield more detectable RNA than the others, using both ddPCR and RT-qPCR assays. We also demonstrate key features of experimental design including the incorporation of appropriate controls and data analysis, and apply these techniques to effectively extract viral RNA from fecal samples acquired from COVID-19 outpatients enrolled in a clinical trial.

The present study shows that serum MBL levels influence the ability of chickens to clear the respiratory tract of virus genomes after an infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection. The primary IBV infection induced changes in circulating T-cell populations and in the specific antibody responses. Serum MBL levels also influenced IBV vaccine-induced changes in circulating T-cell populations. Moreover, addition of mannose to an IBV vaccine altered both vaccine-induced changes in circulating T-cell populations and IBV specific vaccine and infection-induced antibody responses in chickens with high serum MBL levels. These data demonstrate that MBL is involved in the regulation of the adaptive immune response to IBV.","Juul-Madsen, Helle R.; Norup, Liselotte R.; Jørgensen, Poul H.; Handberg, Kurt J.; Wattrang, Eva; Dalgaard, Tina S.",Vaccine,393,30

Globally, on 18 March 2021, a total of 364.184.603 vaccine doses have been administered. In Italy, 3.306.711 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 103.855 deaths have been reported to WHO. In Italy, on 9 March 2021, a total of 6.634.450 vaccine doses have been administered. On 15 March 2021, Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) decided to temporarily suspend the use of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine throughout the country as a precaution, pending the rulings of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). This decision was taken in line with similar measures adopted by other European countries due to the death of vaccinated people. On 18 March 2021, EMA’s safety committee concluded its preliminary review about thromboembolic events in people vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca at its extraordinary meeting, confirming the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risk of side effects, however, the vaccine may be associated with very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, i.e., low levels of blood platelets with or without bleeding, including rare cases of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). We report the case of a 54-year-old woman who developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with multi-district thrombosis 12 days after the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine administration. A brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple subacute intra-axial hemorrhages in atypical locations, including the right frontal and the temporal lobes. A plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) of the right coronary artery was performed, without stent implantation, with restoration of distal flow, but with persistence of extensive thrombosis of the vessel. A successive thorax angio-CT added the findings of multiple contrast filling defects with multi-vessel involvement: at the level of the left upper lobe segmental branches, of left interlobar artery, of the right middle lobe segmental branches and of the right interlobar artery. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the same day showed the presence of an acute basilar thrombosis associated with the superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. An abdomen angio-CT showed filling defects at the level of left portal branch and at the level of right suprahepatic vein. Bilaterally, it was adrenal hemorrhage and blood in the pelvis. An evaluation of coagulation factors did not show genetic alterations so as the nasopharyngeal swab ruled out a COVID-19 infection. The patient died after 5 days of hospitalization in intensive care.","D’Agostino, Vincenzo; Caranci, Ferdinando; Negro, Alberto; Piscitelli, Valeria; Tuccillo, Bernardino; Fasano, Fabrizio; Sirabella, Giovanni; Marano, Ines; Granata, Vincenza; Grassi, Roberta; Pupo, Davide; Grassi, Roberto",J Pers Med,393,16

However, extended postdischarge VTE prophylaxis and VTE prophylaxis for nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 are not routinely recommended due to uncertain benefit in these populations. SUMMARY: Here we report development of a pulmonary embolism (PE) in a young patient without other VTE risk factors who was treated for COVID-19 in an emergency department (ED) and discharged home without VTE prophylaxis, which was consistent with current recommendations. The patient presented to the ED 12 days later with complaints of chest pain for 1 day and was found to have a PE within the segmental and subsegmental branches of the left lower lobe. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 may be at higher risk for VTE than patients with other medical illnesses and warrants further research into the risk of VTE in outpatients with COVID-19.","Uppuluri, Ellen M; Shapiro, Nancy L",Am J Health Syst Pharm,393,22

Data on immune responses following a single-dose adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) in individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection are however limited, and current guidelines recommend a two-dose regimen regardless of preexisting immunity. METHODS: We compared RBD-specific IgG and RBD-ACE2 blocking antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and variants of concern following two doses of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 in SARS-CoV-2 naïve healthcare workers (n=65) and a single dose of the adenovector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in 82 healthcare workers more than (n=45) and less than (n=37) 11 months post mild SARS-CoV-2 infection at time of vaccination. FINDINGS: The post-vaccine levels of RBD-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 wild type and variants of concern including Delta lineage 1.617.2 were similar or higher in participants receiving a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine post SARS-CoV-2 infection (both more than and less than 11 months post infection) compared to SARS-CoV-2 naïve participants who received two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. INTERPRETATION: Our data support that a single dose ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine that is administered up to at least 11 months post SARS-CoV-2 infection serves as an effective immune booster. This provides a possible rationale for a single-dose vaccine regimen.

Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is the key in containing the pandemic and breaking the chain of transmission. In low- and middle-income countries availability of testing kits has become the major bottleneck in testing. Novel methods like pooling of samples are the need of the hour. OBJECTIVE: We undertook this study to evaluate a novel protocol of pooling of RNA samples/elutes in performance of PCR for SARS CoV-2 virus. STUDY DESIGN: Extracted RNA samples were randomly placed in pools of 8 on a 96 well plate. Both individual RNA (ID) and pooled RNA RT-qPCR for the screening E gene were done in the same plate and the positivity for the E gene was seen. RESULTS: The present study demonstrated that pool testing with RNA samples can easily detect even up to a single positive sample with Ct value as high as 38. The present study also showed that the results of pool testing is not affected by number of positive samples in a pool. CONCLUSION: Pooling of RNA samples can reduce the time and expense, and can help expand diagnostic capabilities, especially during constrained supply of reagents and PCR kits for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gupta, Ekta; Padhi, Abhishek; Khodare, Arvind; Agarwal, Reshu; Ramachandran, Krithiga; Mehta, Vibha; Kilikdar, Mousumi; Dubey, Shantanu; Kumar, Guresh; Sarin, Shiv Kumar",PLoS One,393,16

To understand AM’s role in airway disease development, we examined the influence of Secretoglobin family 1a member 1 (SCGB1A1), a pulmonary surfactant protein, on AM development and function. In a murine model, high-throughput RNA-sequencing and gene expression analyses were performed on purified AMs isolated from mice lacking in Scgb1a1 gene and were compared with that from mice expressing the wild type Scgb1a1 at weaning (4 week), puberty (8 week), early adult (12 week), and middle age (40 week). AMs from early adult mice under Scgb1a1 sufficiency demonstrated a total of 37 up-regulated biological pathways compared to that at weaning, from which 30 were directly involved with antigen presentation, anti-viral immunity and inflammation. Importantly, these pathways under Scgb1a1 deficiency were significantly down-regulated compared to that in the age-matched Scgb1a1-sufficient counterparts. Furthermore, AMs from Scgb1a1-deficient mice showed an early activation of inflammatory pathways compared with that from Scgb1a1-sufficient mice. Our in vitro experiments with AM culture established that exogenous supplementation of SCGB1a1 protein significantly reduced AM responses to microbial stimuli where SCGB1a1 was effective in blunting the release of cytokines and chemokines (including IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1a, TNF-a, and MCP-1). Taken together, these findings suggest an important role for Scgb1a1 in shaping the AM-mediated inflammation and immune responses, and in mitigating cytokine surges in the lungs.","Xu, Min; Yang, Wei; Wang, Xuanchuan; Nayak, Deepak Kumar",Front Immunol,393,29

It was found, at first, that the main manifestations of this new virus occur through respiratory and constitutional symptoms. Therefore, chest tomography was elected as the best imaging test to assess the extent of pulmonary involvement and as a good prognostic predictor for the disease. However, as new studies were produced, the gastrointestinal involvement of COVID-19 becomes more evident, with reports from patients who manifested mainly or only gastrointestinal symptoms in the course of the disease. Thus, in some cases, the initial investigation is carried out at the emergency department with an abdominal computed tomography. We report a case series of ten patients who came to the emergency department of our institution with a chief gastrointestinal complaint, and were initially submitted to an abdominal computed tomography as the first investigation. Although most of the patients did not have significant changes in the abdominal images, most reported patients had pulmonary findings visualized at the lung bases, which were later designated as typical COVID-19 pulmonary findings on chest computed tomography. Only one patient had atypical COVID-19 lung changes on chest computed tomography. All patients had a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19. It is imperative to alert radiologists, especially abdominal radiologists, with the possibility of COVID-19 isolated gastrointestinal symptoms.

The purpose of this study was to explore its active compounds and demonstrate its mechanisms against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through network pharmacology and molecular docking. METHODS: All the components of HSBDF were retrieved from the pharmacology database of TCM system. The genes corresponding to the targets were retrieved using UniProt and GeneCards database. The herb–compound–target network was constructed by Cytoscape. The target protein–protein interaction network was built using STRING database. The core targets of HSBDF were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The main active compounds of HSBDF were docked with SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). RESULTS: Compound–target network mainly contained 178 compounds and 272 corresponding targets. Key targets contained MAPK3, MAPK8, TP53, CASP3, IL6, TNF, MAPK1, CCL2, PTGS2, etc. There were 522 GO items in GO enrichment analysis (p < .05) and 168 signaling pathways (p < .05) in KEGG, mainly including TNF signaling pathway, PI3K–Akt signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and HIF-1 signaling pathway. The results of molecular docking showed that baicalein and quercetin were the top two compounds of HSBDF, which had high affinity with ACE2. CONCLUSION: Baicalein and quercetin in HSBDF may regulate multiple signaling pathways through ACE2, which might play a therapeutic role on COVID-19.","Tao, Quyuan; Du, Jiaxin; Li, Xiantao; Zeng, Jingyan; Tan, Bo; Xu, Jianhua; Lin, Wenjia; Chen, Xin-lin",Drug development and industrial pharmacy,393,1

In total, 71% of the selected calves were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts. The statistical analysis revealed influence of colostrum quality on faecal score. Linear regression showed that the colostrum quantity during the first day of life was negatively associated with the number of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts in faeces. During multivariable analysis, the variables representing the quality of colostrum and the season of the calf’s birth were identified as confounders. Cryptosporidium spp. is a common pathogen participating in neonatal calf diarrhoea. Colostrum management and season influence the number of Cryprosporidium spp. oocysts and faecal consistency.

This study categorizes various forms of eHealth usage in conflict and aims to identify gaps in evidence to make recommendations for further research and practice. The analysis was carried out via a narrative hermeneutic review methodology. Articles that fulfilled the following screening criteria were reviewed: (1) describing an eHealth intervention in active conflict or ongoing insurgency, (2) an eHealth intervention targeting a conflict-affected population, (3) an e-learning platform for delivery in conflict settings and (4) non-interventional descriptive reviews relating to eHealth in conflict. Of the 489 papers eligible for screening, 46 merited final inclusion. Conflict settings described include Somalia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Pakistan, Chechnya, Gaza and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Our aim was to describe disability among adults living with HIV and self-care living strategies used during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Adults living with HIV in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, including some with pre-pandemic HIV Disability Questionnaire (HDQ) data, completed a cross-sectional web-based survey between June-August 2020. The survey included the HDQ and questions about self-care living strategy use during the pandemic. We compared disability (HDQ) scores prior to versus during the pandemic using paired t-tests. We reported the proportion of participants who engaged in various living strategies at least ‘a few times a week’ or ‘everyday’ during the pandemic. RESULTS: Of the 63 respondents, 84% were men, median age 57 years, and 62% lived alone. During the pandemic the greatest disability severity was in the uncertainty (median 30; Interquartile range (IQR): 16, 43) and mental-emotional (25; IQR: 14, 41) domains. Among the 51 participants with pre-pandemic data, HDQ severity scores were significantly greater (worse) during the pandemic (vs prior) in all domains. Greatest change from prior to during the pandemic was in the mental-emotional domain for presence (17.7; p<0.001), severity (11.4; p<0.001), and episodic nature (9.3; p<0.05) of disability. Most participants (>60%) reported engaging a ‘few times a week’ or ‘everyday’ in self-care strategies associated with maintaining sense of control and adopting positive attitudes and beliefs.

Using the concept of the migration-development nexus, we address important questions about the nature and scope of development these different policies aim to promote, and achieve. We examine the intersection of policies and initiatives implemented to encourage and support refugee settlement and regional migration in Australia with the perspectives of regionally settled migrants and refugees on their regional migration outcomes. We argue that recent government policies, and multi-stakeholder initiatives aimed at regional migration and/or settlement, cast migrants as differential contributors to regional development, useful either in terms of their skills (skilled migrants) or their labor (backpackers, seasonal workers, refugees). The co-presence of different groups of migrants in regional locations is also shaped by the fluctuating employer demands for mobile labor in combination with visa regulations. We draw on data from three projects on regional settlement, multiculturalism and mobilities to analyze three important elements of regional migration that are central to a critical analysis of the nexus between rural migration and development in regional Australia: the complex roles of employers; the embedding of regional migration in migrants’ life courses; and the tension between long-term migration outcomes and quick fixes. By focusing on development as it is experienced by migrants themselves and interpreted by different stakeholders in regional migration, we draw attention to the limitations of a purely instrumental view of migrants as agents of regional development. We argue that the sustainability of regional migration policies will depend on recognizing the important role of migrants’ hopes, needs and aspirations as well as their rights, and the unintended human costs and consequences of exclusively economically driven migration policy design.","Boese, Martina; Moran, Anthony",Front Sociol,393,21

We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of discharged patients with confirmed COVID-19 not receiving anticoagulation. The cohort included 163 patients with median time from discharge to last recorded follow-up of 30 days (interquartile range [IQR], 17-46 days). The median duration of index hospitalization was 6 days (IQR, 3-12 days) and 26% required intensive care. The cumulative incidence of thrombosis (including arterial and venous events) at day 30 following discharge was 2.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-7.6); the cumulative incidence of venous thromboembolism alone at day 30 postdischarge was 0.6% (95% CI, 0.1-4.6). The 30-day cumulative incidence of major hemorrhage was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.1-5.1) and of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeds was 2.9% (95% CI, 1.0-9.1). We conclude that the rates of thrombosis and hemorrhage appear to be similar following hospital discharge for COVID-19, emphasizing the need for randomized data to inform recommendations for universal postdischarge thromboprophylaxis.","Patell, Rushad; Bogue, Thomas; Koshy, Anita; Bindal, Poorva; Merrill, Mwanasha; Aird, William C.; Bauer, Kenneth A.; Zwicker, Jeffrey I.",Blood,393,13

Based on drug repurposing strategy, we for the first time reported a novel series of troxipide analogs and then evaluated their antiproliferative activity against MCF-7, PC3, MGC-803, and PC9 cancer cell lines and WPMY-1, most of which showed obvious selectivity toward PC-3 over the other three cancer cell lines and WPMY-1. Compound 5q, especially, could effectively inhibit PC3 with an IC(50) value of 0.91 μM, which exhibited around 53-fold selectivity toward WPMY-1. Data indicated that 5q effectively inhibited the colony formation, suppressed the cell migration, and induced G1/S phase arrest in PC3 cells. Also, compound 5q induced cell apoptosis by activating the two apoptotic signaling pathways in PC3 cells: death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway and mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway. Compound 5q up-regulated the expression of both pro-apoptotic Bax and P53, while down-regulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression. Besides, compound 5q significantly increased the expression of cleaved caspase 3/9 and cleaved PARP. Therefore, the successful discovery of compound 5q may further validate the feasibility of this theory, which will encourage researchers to reveal undescribed bioactivities in traditional drugs.","Lu, Nan; Huo, Jin-ling; Wang, Shuai; Yuan, Xiao-Han; Liu, Hong-Min",Eur J Med Chem,393,30

Hip fracture patients represent a high-risk population for severe COVID-19 symptoms, as they are generally older with multiple medical comorbidities. There has been limited information available on the presenting characteristics and outcomes of COVID-positive patients with hip fractures who undergo surgical treatment. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 10 patients ≥60 years of age with a hip fracture and COVID-19 who underwent surgical treatment in New York City during the COVID-19 outbreak from March 1, 2020 to May 22, 2020. Clinical characteristics and early postoperative outcomes were reported. RESULTS: Eight out of the 10 COVID-positive hip fracture patients in our series were asymptomatic on admission with no clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Only 2 patients presented with hypoxia. All 10 patients underwent surgery within 2 days of admission. Five out of the 10 patients – including the patients who presented with hypoxia – subsequently required supplemental oxygen postoperatively. Two patients had persistently elevated oxygen demands requiring prolonged administration of supplemental oxygen therapy beyond postoperative day 3. None of the patients were put on mechanical ventilation. One patient had a presumed venous thromboembolism postoperatively and subsequently died on postoperative day 19, likely due to respiratory failure. There were no other deaths in the early postoperative period. The average length of inpatient stay was 7.8 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that hip fracture patients who present with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection may have temporarily increased oxygen demands postoperatively, but they can safely undergo early surgical intervention after appropriate medical optimization.","Cheung, Zoe B.; Forsh, David A.",J Orthop,393,16

Although plans for using 30-day readmission measures are under consideration for younger patients, little is known about readmission in younger patients or the relationship between readmissions in younger and elderly patients at the same hospital. METHODS: By using the 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database, we examined readmission patterns in younger patients (18-64 years) using hierarchical models to evaluate associations between hospital 30-day, risk-standardized readmission rates in elderly Medicare patients and readmission risk in younger patients with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, or pneumonia. RESULTS: There were 87,818, 98,315, and 103,251 admissions in younger patients for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia, respectively, with overall 30-day unplanned readmission rates of 8.5%, 21.4%, and 13.7%, respectively. Readmission risk in younger patients was significantly associated with hospital 30-day risk-standardized readmission rates for elderly Medicare patients for all 3 conditions. A decrease in an average hospital's 30-day, risk-standardized readmission rates from the 75th percentile to the 25th percentile was associated with reduction in younger patients' risk of readmission from 8.8% to 8.0% (difference: 0.7%; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-0.9) for acute myocardial infarction; 21.8% to 20.0% (difference: 1.8%; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.2) for heart failure; and 13.9% to 13.1% (difference: 0.8%; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.0) for pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Among younger patients, readmission risk was moderately associated with hospital 30-day, risk-standardized readmission rates in elderly Medicare beneficiaries. Efforts to reduce readmissions among older patients may have important areas of overlap with younger patients, although further research may be necessary to identify specific mechanisms to tailor initiatives to younger patients.","Sukul, Devraj; Sinha, Shashank S.; Ryan, Andrew M.; Sjoding, Michael W.; Hummel, Scott L.; Nallamothu, Brahmajee K.",Am J Med,393,16

We explored pharmacy students' perspective on its impact on their learning. METHODS: A Twitter chat was organized on three consecutive days, after final examinations, inviting all pharmacy students in KSA to participate. Day 1 chat included 11 questions regarding learning and assessment, Day 2 chat included six questions about online examinations and six questions about technology use, Day 3 chat included six questions related to lessons learnt from the learning experiences during the lockdown. The questions were validated and piloted before the chat. The responses were copied, reviewed to remove any confidential information, and thematically analyzed by two teams of research students independently. RESULTS: During the three-day chat, 790 responses were received in total. Thematic analysis generated 944 codes which were categorized into 43 subthemes. These subthemes were further categorized into six main themes: ‘facilitators for online education’, ‘barriers for online education’, ‘online versus onsite education’, ‘role of technology in online education’, ‘suggestions for improving online education’ and ‘long-term impact of online education during lockdown’. Participants highlighted several facilitators and barriers which affected their education during the lockdown, compared online education with onsite education, and provided suggestions for improving online education based on their learning experiences during the lockdown.

It has been recently recognized that the interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITM) 1, 2 and 3 can block entry of a broad spectrum of RNA viruses. However, no study to date has focused on the role of IFITM proteins in DNA virus restriction. Here, we demonstrate that IFN-α or -β treatment of keratinocytes substantially decreases human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) infection while robustly inducing IFITM1, 2 and 3 expression. However, IFITM1, 2 and 3 overexpression did not inhibit HPV16 infection; rather, IFITM1 and IFITM3 modestly enhanced HPV16 infection in various cell types including primary keratinocytes. Moreover, IFITM1, 2 and 3 did not inhibit infection by two other DNA viruses, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and adenovirus type 5 (Ad5). Taken together, we reveal that the entry of several DNA viruses, including HPV, HCMV, and Ad5 is not affected by IFITM1, 2 and 3 expression. These results imply that HPV, and other DNA viruses, may bypass IFITM restriction during intracellular trafficking.","Warren, Cody J.; Griffin, Laura M.; Little, Alexander S.; Huang, I-Chueh; Farzan, Michael; Pyeon, Dohun",PLoS One,393,16

Methods Between January 2018 and March 2020, 1027 NCPP and 1140 IP were recruited from Tongji hospital. Blood routine examination, biochemical indicators, and coagulation function analysis were performed in all participants simultaneously. Results There was no sex predominance in NCPP. The NCPP were frequently encountered in the sixth and seventh decades of life. The mean age of NCPP (56±16 years) was higher than IP (47±17 years), but without statistical difference. Although most results of routine laboratory tests between NCPP and IP had no significant difference, some laboratory tests showed an obvious change in NCPP. We observed that NCPP had significantly decreased white blood cells, alkaline phosphatase, and d-dimer, compared with IP. However, the results of lactate dehydrogenase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fibrinogen were significantly increased in NCPP compared with those in IP. The diagnostic model based on combination of eighteen routine laboratory indicators showed an area under the curve of 0.796 (95% CI, 0.777 to 0.814), with a sensitivity of 46.93% and a specificity of 90.09% when using a cutoff value of 0.598.

DesignWe used an abbreviated preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocol (PRISMA-P) and a search strategy aimed to identify studies that investigated the effectiveness of travel-related measures (advice, entry and exit screening, medical examination or vaccination requirements, isolation or quarantine, the refusal of entry, and entry restrictions), pre-printed or published by June 1, 2020. ResultsWe identified 29 studies, of which 26 were modelled (vs. observational). Thirteen studies investigated international measures while 17 investigated domestic measures (one investigated both), including suspended transportation (24 studies), border restrictions (21), and screening (5). There was a high level of agreement that the adoption of travel measures led to important changes in the dynamics of the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of the identified studies investigated the initial export of cases out of Wuhan, which was found to be highly effective, but few studies investigated the effectiveness of measures implemented in other contexts. Early implementation was identified as a determinant of effectiveness. Most studies of international travel measures failed to account for domestic travel measures, and thus likely led to biased estimates. Poor data and other factors contributed to the low quality of the studies identified. ConclusionTravel measures, especially those implemented in Wuhan, played a key role in shaping the early transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the effectiveness of these measures was short-lived.

This virus has shown high infectivity and severe symptoms in some cases, leading to over 1.5 million deaths globally. Despite the collaborative and concerted research efforts that have been made, no effective medication for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) is currently available. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an initial mediator for viral attachment and host cell invasion. ACE2 is widely distributed in the human tissues including the cell surface of lung cells which represent the primary site of the infection. Inhibiting or reducing cell surface availability of ACE2 represents a promising therapy for tackling COVID-19. In this context, most ACE2–based therapeutic strategies have aimed to tackle the virus through the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or neutralizing the virus by exogenous administration of ACE2, which does not directly aim to reduce its membrane availability. However, through this review, we present a different perspective focusing on the subcellular localization and trafficking of ACE2. Membrane targeting of ACE2, and shedding and cellular trafficking pathways including the internalization are not well elucidated in literature. Therefore, we hereby present an overview of the fate of newly synthesized ACE2, its post translational modifications, and what is known of its trafficking pathways. In addition, we highlight the possibility that some of the identified ACE2 missense variants might affect its trafficking efficiency and localization and hence may explain some of the observed variable severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Moreover, an extensive understanding of these processes is necessarily required to evaluate the potential use of ACE2 as a credible therapeutic target.","Badawi, Sally; Ali, Bassam R.",Hum Genomics,393,16

Videoconference-based telehealth has been shown to be an effective and acceptable mode of service delivery for exercise-based interventions for chronic knee pain; however, specific training in telehealth is required for physiotherapists to effectively and consistently deliver care using telehealth. The development and evaluation of training programs to upskill health care professionals in the management of osteoarthritis (OA) has also been identified as an important priority to improve OA care delivery. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore physiotherapists’ experiences with and perceptions of an e-learning program about best practice knee OA management (focused on a structured program of education, exercise, and physical activity) that includes telehealth delivery via videoconferencing. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using individual semistructured telephone interviews, nested within the Physiotherapy Exercise and Physical Activity for Knee Osteoarthritis randomized controlled trial, referred to as the PEAK trial. A total of 15 Australian physiotherapists from metropolitan and regional private practices were interviewed following the completion of an e-learning program. The PEAK trial e-learning program involved self-directed learning modules, a mock video consultation with a researcher (simulated patient), and 4 audited practice video consultations with pilot patients with chronic knee pain. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: A total of five themes (with associated subthemes) were identified: the experience of self-directed e-learning (physiotherapists were more familiar with in-person learning; however, they valued the comprehensive, self-paced web-based modules. Unwieldy technological features could be frustrating); practice makes perfect (physiotherapists benefited from the mock consultation with the researcher and practice sessions with pilot patients alongside individualized performance feedback, resulting in confidence and preparedness to implement new skills); the telehealth journey (although inexperienced with telehealth before training, physiotherapists were confident and able to deliver remote care following training; however, they still experienced some technological challenges); the whole package (the combination of self-directed learning modules, mock consultation, and practice consultations with pilot patients was felt to be an effective learning approach, and patient information booklets supported the training package); and impact on broader clinical practice (training consolidated and refined existing OA management skills and enabled a switch to telehealth when the COVID-19 pandemic affected in-person clinical care). CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide evidence for the perceived effectiveness and acceptability of an e-learning program to train physiotherapists (in the context of a clinical trial) on best practice knee OA management, including telehealth delivery via videoconferencing. The implementation of e-learning programs to upskill physiotherapists in telehealth appears to be warranted, given the increasing adoption of telehealth service models for the delivery of clinical care.","Jones, Sarah E; Campbell, Penny K; Kimp, Alexander J; Bennell, Kim; Foster, Nadine E; Russell, Trevor; Hinman, Rana S",J Med Internet Res,393,20

Unlike other multishelled reoviruses, cypovirus has a single-layered capsid, thereby representing a simplified model for studying vRNA replication of reoviruses. VP5 is one of the three major cypovirus capsid proteins and functions as a clamp protein to stabilize cypovirus capsid. Here, we expressed VP5 from type 5 Helicoverpa armigera cypovirus (HaCPV-5) in a eukaryotic system and determined that this VP5 possesses RNA chaperone-like activity, which destabilizes RNA helices and accelerates strand annealing independent of ATP. Our further characterization of VP5 revealed that its helix-destabilizing activity is RNA specific, lacks directionality and could be inhibited by divalent ions, such as Mg(2+), Mn(2+), Ca(2+) or Zn(2+), to varying degrees. Furthermore, we found that HaCPV-5 VP5 facilitates the replication initiation of an alternative polymerase (i.e. reverse transcriptase) through a panhandle-structured RNA template, which mimics the 5′-3′ cyclization of cypoviral positive-stranded RNA. Given that the replication of negative-stranded vRNA on the positive-stranded vRNA template necessitates the dissociation of the 5′-3′ panhandle, the RNA chaperone activity of VP5 may play a direct role in the initiation of reoviral dsRNA synthesis.","Yang, Jie; Cheng, Zhenyun; Zhang, Songliu; Xiong, Wei; Xia, Hongjie; Qiu, Yang; Wang, Zhaowei; Wu, Feige; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Yin, Lei; Hu, Yuanyang; Zhou, Xi",Nucleic Acids Res,393,1

Furthermore, culture is poorly suited to the diagnosis of polymicrobial infections. Finally, a syndromic approach should target both bacteria and viruses causing the same syndrome. The detection of specific DNA sequences in clinical specimen, using DNA microarrays, is an alternative. Microarrays were first used as a diagnostic tool in 1993, to identify a hantavirus associated with an outbreak of acute respiratory diseases. The main advantage of microarrays is multiplexing, enabling exploration of the microbiota and pathogen detection in bacteremia, respiratory infections, and digestive infections: circumstance in which DNA arrays may lack sensitivity and provide false negatives. Enrichment of sampling can increase sensitivity. Furthermore, chips allow typing Streptococcus pneumoniae and detecting resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (rifampicin, isoniazid, fluoroquinolones).

However, less is known about how race and ethnicity and neighborhood-level disadvantage may intersect to contribute to both COVID-19 mortality and excess mortality during the pandemic. To assess this potential interaction of race and ethnicity with neighborhood disadvantage, we link death certificate data from Minnesota from the period 2017-20 to the Area Deprivation Index to examine hyperlocal disparities in mortality. Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) standardized COVID-19 mortality was 459 deaths per 100,000 population in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods compared with 126 per 100,000 in the most advantaged. Total mortality increased in 2020 by 14 percent for non-Hispanic White people and 41 percent for BIPOC. Statistical decompositions show that most of this growth in racial and ethnic disparity is associated with mortality gaps between White people and communities of color within the same levels of area disadvantage, rather than with the fact that White people live in more advantaged areas.

The Jess(TM) Simple Western system, an automated capillary-based assay, was used, incorporating an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 lineage 20a strain as the source of antigen, and total immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) detection. In total, 602 sera were tested including 223 from RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, 76 from patients diagnosed with seasonal HCoVs and 303 from coronavirus-negative control sera. We also compared this assay with the EUROIMMUN® SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA kit. Among 223 sera obtained from RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, 180/223 (81%) exhibited reactivity against the nucleocapsid and 70/223 (31%) against the spike protein. Nucleocapsid reactivity was further detected in 9/76 (14%) samples collected from patients diagnosed with seasonal HCoVs and in 15/303 (5%) coronavirus-negative control samples. In the subset of sera collected more than 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms, the sensitivity was 94% and the specificity 93%, the latter value probably reflecting cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses.

Bats are linked to a growing number of EID but few studies have explored the factors of viral richness in bats. These may have implications for role of bats as potential reservoirs. We investigated the determinants of viral richness in 15 species of African bats (8 Pteropodidae and 7 microchiroptera) in Central and West Africa for which we provide new information on virus infection and bat phylogeny. We performed the first comparative analysis testing the correlation of the fragmented geographical distribution (defined as the perimeter to area ratio) with viral richness in bats. Because of their potential effect, sampling effort, host body weight, ecological and behavioural traits such as roosting behaviour, migration and geographical range, were included into the analysis as variables. The results showed that the geographical distribution size, shape and host body weight have significant effects on viral richness in bats. Viral richness was higher in large-bodied bats which had larger and more fragmented distribution areas. Accumulation of viruses may be related to the historical expansion and contraction of bat species distribution range, with potentially strong effects of distribution edges on virus transmission. Two potential explanations may explain these results. A positive distribution edge effect on the abundance or distribution of some bat species could have facilitated host switches. Alternatively, parasitism could play a direct role in shaping the distribution range of hosts through host local extinction by virulent parasites. This study highlights the importance of considering the fragmentation of bat species geographical distribution in order to understand their role in the circulation of viruses in Africa.","Maganga, Gaël D.; Bourgarel, Mathieu; Vallo, Peter; Dallo, Thierno D.; Ngoagouni, Carine; Drexler, Jan Felix; Drosten, Christian; Nakouné, Emmanuel R.; Leroy, Eric M.; Morand, Serge",PLoS One,393,22

However, toxicological effects associated with inhibition of thiol-containing enzymes, such as the δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (δ-AlaD), have been described. The molecular mechanism(s) by which they inhibit thiol-containing enzymes at the atomic level, is still not well known. The use of computational methods to understand the physical-chemical properties and biological activity of chemicals is essential to the rational design of new drugs. In this work, we propose an in silico study to understand the δ-AlaD inhibition mechanism by diphenyl diselenide (DPDS) and its putative metabolite, phenylseleninic acid (PSA), using δ-AlaD enzymes from Homo sapiens (Hsδ-AlaD), Drosophila melanogaster (Dmδ-AlaD) and Cucumis sativus (Csδ-AlaD). Protein modeling homology, molecular docking, and DFT calculations are combined in this study. According to the molecular docking, DPDS and PSA might bind in the Hsδ-AlaD and Dmδ-AlaD active sites interacting with the cysteine residues by Se(…)S interactions. On the other hand, the DPDS does not access the active site of the Csδ-AlaD (a non-thiol protein), while the PSA interacts with the amino acids residues from the active site, such as the Lys291. These interactions might lead to the formation of a covalent bond, and consequently, to the enzyme inhibition. In fact, DFT calculations (mPW1PW91/def2TZVP) demonstrated that the selenylamide bond formation is energetically favored. The in silico data showed here are in accordance with previous experimental studies, and help us to understand the reactivity and biological activity of organoselenium compounds.","Nogara, Pablo Andrei; Orian, Laura; Rocha, João Batista Teixeira",Comput Toxicol,393,20

Coronavirus (COVID-19) has become one of the most severe and acute diseases in very recent times that has been spread globally. Automatic disease detection framework assists the doctors in the diagnosis of disease and provides exact, consistent, and fast reply as well as reduces the death rate. Therefore, an automated detection system should be implemented as the fastest way of diagnostic option to impede COVID-19 from spreading. This paper aims to introduce a deep learning technique based on the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short -term memory (LSTM) to diagnose COVID-19 automatically from X-ray images. In this system, CNN is used for deep feature extraction and LSTM is used for detection using the extracted feature. A collection of 421 X -ray images including 141 images of COVID-19 is used as a dataset in this system. The experimental results show that our proposed system has achieved 97% accuracy, 91% specificity, and 100% sensitivity. The system achieved desired results on a small dataset which can be further improved when more COVID-19 images become available.

In the present study, the complete genome sequence of Newbury1 was determined and classified Newbury1 in a new genus of the Caliciviridae. The Newbury1 genome, of 7454 nucleotides, had two predicted open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encoded the non-structural and contiguous capsid proteins. ORF2 encoded a basic protein characteristic of the family Caliciviridae. Compared to the 4 recognized Caliciviridae genera, Norovirus, Sapovirus, Lagovirus and Vesivirus, Newbury1 had less than 39% amino acid (47% nucleotide) identity in the complete 2C-helicase, 3C-protease, 3D-polymerase and capsid regions but had 89% to 98% amino acid (78% to 92% nucleotide) identity to the recently characterized NB virus in these regions. By phylogenetic analyses, Newbury1 and NB viruses formed a distinct clade independent of the 4 recognized genera. However, amino acid identities showed that Newbury1 and the NB virus were distinct polymerase types (90% amino acid identity), but their complete capsid proteins were almost identical (98% amino acid identity). Analyses of contemporary viruses showed that the two polymerase genotypes, Newbury1 and NB, were circulating in UK cattle and antibody to Newbury1-like viruses was common in cattle sera.

MethodsAt twenty-four randomly selected primary and secondary schools, one class each was examined. Oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and capillary blood samples were collected to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR) and specific IgG (ELISA), respectively. Medical history, household and schooling characteristics, leisure time activities, fear of infection, risk perception, hand hygiene, physical distancing, and facemask wearing were assessed. ResultsAmong 535 participants (385 students, 150 staff), one teenager was SARS-CoV-2 infected (0.2%), and seven individuals exhibited specific IgG (1.3%); 16% reported symptoms upon examination, and 48% in the preceding 14 days. Compared to before the pandemic, the proportion of leisure time spent as screen-time increased, and the majority of primary school students reported reduced physical activity. Fear of infection and risk perception were relatively low, but acceptance of adapted health behaviours was high. Governmental preventive measures were adequately implemented, with primary schools performing better than secondary schools. ConclusionIn this phase of rare infection and low seroreactivity, individual and school-level infection prevention and control measures were largely adhered to.

Whereas 70% of the COVID-19 patients expressed ACE2 in the vasculature, only 30% displayed ACE2-expression in beta-cells. Even in the absence of manifest new-onset diabetes, necroptotic cell death, immune cell infiltration and SARS-CoV-2 viral infection of pancreatic beta-cells may contribute to varying degrees of metabolic dysregulation in patients with COVID-19.","Steenblock, Charlotte; Richter, Stefanie; Berger, Ilona; Barovic, Marko; Schmid, Janine; Schubert, Undine; Jarzebska, Natalia; von Mässenhausen, Anne; Linkermann, Andreas; Schürmann, Annette; Pablik, Jessica; Dienemann, Thomas; Evert, Katja; Rodionov, Roman N.; Semenova, Natalia Y.; Zinserling, Vsevolod A.; Gainetdinov, Raul R.; Baretton, Gustavo; Lindemann, Dirk; Solimena, Michele; Ludwig, Barbara; Bornstein, Stefan R.",Nat Commun,393,26

Procedures involving the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) are routinely non-aerosolizing but have the potential for rapid patient deterioration, creating the need for aerosolizing generating procedures. Multiple societal and governmental guidelines on the use of PPE during medical procedures are available on Internet websites; however, there is limited literature available in peer-reviewed formats in this context. This study aims to provide an overview of current PPE donning and doffing protocols specific to the catheterization laboratory. Methods: A series of internet searches regarding donning and doffing of PPE in the CCL including published articles and internet protocols were compiled and compared using Pubmed.gov, Google.com, www.twitter.com, and www.youtube.com. Results: Most institutions used N95 masks, shoe covers, at least one head covering, face shield or goggles, two pairs of gloves, and inner and outer gowns. Doffing variation was greater than donning. Doffing has the potential to contaminate the healthcare worker (HCW), and therefore, this step of PPE management requires further study. Common steps in temporal priority included cleaning of gloved hands, removal of outer (or only) gown, removal of outer gloves, repeat gloved hand cleaning, removal of facial PPE last, and a final non-gloved hand cleaning. Conclusions: This analysis provides a summary of commonly used practices that may be considered when designing CCL-specific PPE protocols. Analysis of consistent steps from the literature led the authors to formulate a suggested protocol for CCL HCWs when performing procedures on patients with confirmed or suspected/unknown COVID-19.","Haloot, Justin; Sheikh, Omar; Dollar, Fatima; Javeri, Heta; Fichardt, Hendre Jeannetta; Fernandes, Gail; Garcia, Marlene; Prasad, Anand",Front Cardiovasc Med,393,6

Given that LTACHs provide more intensive care and thus receive over triple the reimbursement of SNFs for comparable diagnoses, we sought to compare outcomes and spending between LTACH versus SNF transfer. METHODS: Using Medicare claims linked to electronic health record (EHR) data from six Texas Hospitals between 2009 and 2010, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized on a medicine service in a high-LTACH use region and discharged to either an LTACH or SNF and followed for one year. The primary outcomes included mortality, 60-day recovery without inpatient care, days at home, and healthcare spending RESULTS: Of 3503 patients, 18% were transferred to an LTACH. Patients transferred to LTACHs were younger (median 71 vs. 82 years), less likely to be female (50.5 vs 66.6%) and white (69.0 vs. 84.1%), but were sicker (24.3 vs. 14.2% for prolonged intensive care unit stay; median diagnosis resource intensity weight of 2.03 vs. 1.38). In unadjusted analyses, patients transferred to an LTACH vs. SNF were less likely to survive (59.1 vs. 65.0%) or recover (62.5 vs 66.0%), and spent fewer days at home (186 vs. 200). Adjusting for demographic and clinical confounders available in Medicare claims and EHR data, LTACH transfer was not significantly associated with differences in mortality (HR, 1.12, 95% CI, 0.94–1.33), recovery (SHR, 1.07, 0.93–1.23), and days spent at home (IRR, 0.96, 0.83–1.10), but was associated with greater Medicare spending ($16,689 for one year, 95% CI, $12,216–$21,162). CONCLUSION: LTACH transfer for Medicare beneficiaries is associated with similar clinical outcomes but with higher healthcare spending compared to SNF transfer. LTACH use should be reserved for patients who require complex inpatient care and cannot be cared for in SNFs.

The broad range of COVID-19 clinical manifestations may indicate diversity of virus-host cells. Amongst key manifestations, especially in severe COVID-19 patients, reduction and/or exhaustion of lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and dendritic cells are seen.; therefore, it is required to recognize that how the virus infects the cells. Interestingly, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the well-known receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is low or non-expressed in these cells. Using computational approach, several receptor candidates including leukocyte surface molecules and chemokine receptors that expressed in most lineages of immune cells were evaluated as the feasible receptor of spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. The results revealed the higher binding affinity of CD26, CD2, CD56, CD7, CCR9, CD150, CD4, CD50, XCR1 and CD106 compared to ACE2. However, the modes of binding and amino acids involved in the interactions with the RBD domain of spike were various. Overall, the affinity of immune receptor candidates in binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD may offer insight into the recognition of novel therapeutic targets in association with COVID-19.","Mobini, Saeed; Chizari, Milad; Mafakher, Ladan; Rismani, Elmira; Rismani, Elham",J Mol Graph Model,393,15

Relaxing this assumption can be challenging though, due to the difficulty of acquiring detailed knowledge about the non-random nature of encounters. Here, we fitted a mathematical model of dengue virus transmission to spatial time-series data from Pakistan and compared maximum-likelihood estimates of ‘mixing parameters’ when disaggregating data across an urban–rural gradient. We show that dynamics across this gradient are subject not only to differing transmission intensities but also to differing strengths of nonlinearity due to differences in mixing. Accounting for differences in mobility by incorporating two fine-scale, density-dependent covariate layers eliminates differences in mixing but results in a doubling of the estimated transmission potential of the large urban district of Lahore. We furthermore show that neglecting spatial variation in mixing can lead to substantial underestimates of the level of effort needed to control a pathogen with vaccines or other interventions. We complement this analysis with estimates of the relationships between dengue transmission intensity and other putative environmental drivers thereof.","Kraemer, M. U. G.; Perkins, T.

Existing schemes in ICUs today require laborious manual input of many complex parameters. In this work, we present a scheme that uses variations in vital signs over a 24-h period to make mortality risk assessments for 3-day, 7-day, and 14-day windows. We develop a hybrid neural network model that combines convolutional (CNN) layers with bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to predict mortality from statistics describing the variation of heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, blood oxygen levels, and temperature. Our scheme performs strongly compared to state-of-the-art schemes in the literature for mortality prediction, with our highest-performing model achieving an area under the receiver-operator curve of 0.884. We conclude that the use of a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM network is highly effective in determining mortality risk for the 3, 7, and 14 day windows from vital signs. As vital signs are routinely recorded, in many cases automatically, our scheme could be implemented such that highly accurate mortality risk could be predicted continuously and automatically, reducing the burden on healthcare providers and improving patient outcomes.","Baker, Stephanie; Xiang, Wei; Atkinson, Ian",Sci Rep,393,1

Teleophthalmological services, such as video consultation or medical telephone advice could, at least partially, compensate for the lack of necessary controls in the case of chronic diseases; however, teleophthalmological options are currently still significantly underrepresented in Germany. OBJECTIVE: In order to determine the willingness of patients to use telemedicine and the virtual clinic, we conducted a survey using a questionnaire on the subject of teleophthalmology in university medicine patients with known glaucoma as a chronic disease during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of100 patients were interviewed. The questionnaire contained 22 questions with multiple choice possible answers. The inclusion criterion was the presence of glaucoma as a chronic disease, age over 18 years, and sufficient linguistic understanding to answer the questions. The data were collected, analyzed and anonymously evaluated. RESULTS: In the patient survey it could be shown that the respondents with glaucoma are very willing to do teleophthalmology and that this would be utilized. Of the patients surveyed 74.0% would accept telemedicine and virtual clinics. Of the ophthalmological patients surveyed 54.0% stated that their visit to the doctor/clinic could not take place due to SARS-CoV‑2 and 17.0% of the patients stated that the SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic had changed their opinion of telemedicine. DISCUSSION: The acceptance of telemedicine in patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma seems surprisingly high. This has been increased even further by the SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic. These results reflect a general willingness of patients with chronic eye disease but do not reflect the applicability and acceptance and applicability from a medical point of view; however, this form of virtual consultation is accepted by the majority of patients with glaucoma and could be considered for certain clinical pictures.","Zwingelberg, Sarah B.; Mercieca, Karl; Elksne, Eva; Scheffler, Stephanie; Prokosch, Verena",Ophthalmologe,393,1

The large amount of data generated produces an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively profile the relevant metagenomic communities. Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens.

Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional study using data from the EMR at a public hospital in the Bronx, New York. Included patients were aged 13 and over that had STI testing from Aug. 1, 2019 to Feb. 1, 2020 (Period 1) and Aug. 1, 2020 to Feb. 1, 2021 (Period 2) in the adult or pediatric ED. Periods 1 and 2 are 6 month periods before and after the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic in NYC, respectively. Counts and percents were used to quantify STI tests (HIV point of care, HIV 4th generation serum, Gonorrhea Amplification, Chlamydia Amplification, and Treponema Pallidum Ab screen) and positive results during Period 1 vs. Period 2. A chi-squared test of independence determined significance of positivity rates in Period 1 vs Period 2 with a p-value of.05. Results: In Period 1, there were 2386 distinct patients accounting for 5445 STI tests with 54% female, 30% male and 18% unknown or other self-identified sex. The average age of all patients was 37 years (S.D. ± 15). In Period 2, 2218 distinct ED patients accounting for 5816 STI tests with 52% female, 24% male, 24% unknown or other self-identified sex. The average age for Period 2 was 37 years (S.D. ± 15). Our data (Table 1) show that more STI diagnostic tests were performed in Period 2 than Period 1 for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis in our ED. There were fewer HIV tests performed in Period 2. There were no significant differences in positivity rates between Periods 1 and 2 for HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis, although there was a trend towards significance for gonorrhea and syphilis. Conclusion: A higher absolute number of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis tests were performed in our ED in the post-SARS-CoV-19 time period. This overall increase in testing may be due to an increased utilization of emergency services given oversubscribed outpatient resources. The decrease in HIV testing could be due to patients opting out of testing, or providers having a lower suspicion of HIV infection in the context of the pandemic. A stable positivity rate could imply that despite newly imposed SARS-CoV-19 guidelines on social behavior, patients in our population continued to engage in condomless sexual encounters. STI testing panels incorporated into the electronic medical record may facilitate complete STI testing that includes HIV as an opt-out reminder for providers.

Each ON case was matched with 10 randomly selected population control subjects from general population. For all participants, we obtained a complete hospital history of comorbidities included in the CharlsonComorbidity Index 5 years preceding the inclusion date. RESULTS: 4107 ON cases and 41 063 controls were included. The incidence of ON increased from 3.9 in 1995 to 5.5 in 2012 per 100 000 inhabitants. Solid cancer was the most common comorbidity, associated with an adjusted OR (aOR) for ON of 2.0 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.2). For advanced metastatic cancer, leukaemia and lymphoma, aORs of ON were 3.4 (95% CI 2.5 to 4.5), 4.3 (95% CI 2.7 to 7.0) and 5.8 (95% CI 4.3 to 7.8), respectively.

As such, we investigated whether the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/albumin ratio (BAR) predicts mortality in the COVID-19 patients in the emergency department. METHODS: A total of 602 COVID-19 patients who were brought to the emergency department within the period from March to September 2020 were included in the study. The BUN level, albumin level, BAR, age, gender, and in-hospital mortality status of the patients were recorded. The patients were grouped by in-hospital mortality. Statistical comparison was conducted between the groups. RESULTS: Of the patients who were included in the study, 312(51.8%) were male, and their median age was 63 years (49–73). There was in-hospital mortality in 96(15.9%) patients. The median BUN and BAR values of the patients in the non-survivor group were significantly higher than those in the survivor group (BUN: 24.76 [17.38–38.31] and 14.43 [10.84–20.42], respectively [p < 0.001]; BAR: 6.7 [4.7–10.1] and 3.4 [2.5–5.2], respectively [p < 0.001]). The mean albumin value in the non-survivor group was significantly lower than that in the survivor group (3.60 ± 0.58 and 4.13 ± 0.51, respectively; p < 0.001). The area-under-the-curve (AUC) and odds ratio values obtained by BAR to predict in-hospital COVID-19 mortality were higher than the values obtained by BUN and albumin (AUC of BAR, BUN, and albumin: 0.809, 0.771, and 0.765, respectively; odds ratio of BAR>3.9, BUN>16.05, and albumin<4.01: 10.448, 7.048, and 6.482, respectively).

Cotransfection yielded plaque-forming virus that synthesized the standard genomic and subgenomic RNAs and thus was generated by RNA–RNA recombination. Using transcripts tagged with a 3′-terminal deletion, it was found that recombinants contained the 3′ end derived from the replicative strand, indicating a cis-preference for initiation of negative-strand synthesis. In cotransfections in which the replicative transcript lacked the 3′ CSE, recombination occurred, albeit at lower efficiency, indicating that initiation in trans from the NS-ORF can occur. The 3′ CSE was sufficient as a nonreplicative transcript, showing that it can serve as a promoter for negative-strand RNA synthesis. While deletion mutagenesis showed that the presence of the junction untranslated region (J-UTR) between the ORFs appeared to be necessary on both transcripts for recombination in this region of the genome, analysis with transcripts tagged with restriction sites showed that the J-UTR was not a hot spot for recombination compared to neighboring regions in both ORFs. Sequence analysis of recombinants revealed that both precise (homologous) and imprecise recombination (aberrant, homologous resulting in duplications) occurred; however, imprecise recombination only involved the J-UTR or the 3′ end of the NS-ORF and the J-UTR (maintaining the NS-ORF), indicating selection pressure against duplications in other regions of the genome.","Adams, Sandra D.; Tzeng, Wen-Pin; Chen, Min-Hsin; Frey, Teryl K.",Virology,393,32

We simulate the dynamics, coalescence, and collection of droplets of the size comparable with the fiber and pore size in typical fluid-dynamic conditions that represent common expiratory events. We discern the fibrous microstructure into three categories of pores: small, large, and medium-sized pores, where we find that within the latter, the incoming droplets tend to be more likely intercepted. The size of the medium-sized pores relative to the fiber size is placed between the droplet-to-fiber size ratio and a porosity-dependent microstructural parameter [Formula: see text] , with ϵ being the porosity. In larger pores, droplets collection is instead inhibited by the small pore-throat-to-fiber size ratio that characterizes the pore perimeter, limiting their access. The efficiency of the fibrous media in intercepting droplets without compromising breathability, for a given droplet-to-fiber size ratio, can be estimated by knowing the parameter [Formula: see text]. We propose a simple model that predicts the average penetration of droplets into the fibrous media, showing a sublinear growth with [Formula: see text]. Permeability is shown also to scale well with [Formula: see text] but following a superlinear growth, which indicates the possibility of increasing the medium permeability at a little cost in terms of interception efficiency for high values of porosity. As a general design guideline, the results also suggest that a fibrous layer thickness relative to the fiber size should exceed the value [Formula: see text] in order to ensure effective droplets filtration.","Maggiolo, Dario; Sasic, Srdjan",Phys Fluids (1994),393,10

However, synthesizing knowledge from past pandemics can help to anticipate this, along with identifying interventions required, when, and target populations most in need. This paper provides a balanced evaluation of what is currently known about short- and long-term MH impacts of pandemics on HCWs and effect of methodological limitations on knowledge claims. Method: A rapid evidence assessment (REA) was conducted on 41 studies published in the past two decades that examined MH outcomes for HCWs in relation to pandemics. Results: Findings of literary synthesis highlight common MH outcomes across pandemics, including increased stress, distress, burnout, and anxiety in the short-term, and post-traumatic stress and depression in the long-term. Findings also show the key role that organizations and public health bodies play in promoting adaptive coping and reducing health worries and the emotional and psychological distress caused by this. Evidence highlights particular groups at risk of developing MH issues (contact with patients that are infected, having children), and time points where risk may increase (initial response phase, when quarantined). However, inconsistencies in measures, analysis, and reporting all create limitations for pooling data. Conclusions: Findings can be used by researchers to provide a knowledge framework to inform future research that will assist HCWs in responding to pandemics, and by policy makers and service planners to provide an evidence-led brief about direction and evidence base for related policy initiatives, interventions or service programmes.","Waring, Sara; Giles, Susan",Front Public Health,393,23

Mitigating the spread of disease requires an individual to change their routine behaviours to benefit others, resulting in a ‘disease dilemma’ similar to the seminal prisoner’s dilemma. In the classical prisoner’s dilemma, evolutionary game dynamics predict that all individuals evolve to ‘defect.’ We have discovered that when the rate of cooperation within a population is directly linked to the rate of spread of the disease, cooperation evolves under certain conditions. For diseases which do not confer immunity to recovered individuals, if the time scale at which individuals receive accurate information regarding the disease is sufficiently rapid compared to the time scale at which the disease spreads, then cooperation emerges. Moreover, in the limit as mitigation measures become increasingly effective, the disease can be controlled; the number of infections tends to zero. It has been suggested that disease spreading models may also describe social and group dynamics, indicating that this mechanism for the evolution of cooperation may also apply in those contexts.","Karlsson, Carl-Joar; Rowlett, Julie",Sci Rep,393,26

Where surveillance is underfunctioning, community-based surveillance can contribute to rapid outbreak detection and response, a core capacity of the International Health Regulations. We reviewed articles describing the potential for community-based surveillance to detect diseases of epidemic potential, outbreaks, and mortality among populations affected by crises. Surveillance objectives have included the early warning of outbreaks, active case finding during outbreaks, case finding for eradication programmes, and mortality surveillance. Community-based surveillance can provide sensitive and timely detection, identify valid signals for diseases with salient symptoms, and provide continuity in remote areas during cycles of insecurity. Effectiveness appears to be mediated by operational requirements for continuous supervision of large community networks, verification of a large number of signals, and integration of community-based surveillance within the routine investigation and response infrastructure. Similar to all community health systems, community-based surveillance requires simple design, reliable supervision, and early and routine monitoring and evaluation to ensure data validity. Research priorities include the evaluation of syndromic case definitions, electronic data collection for community members, sentinel site designs, and statistical techniques to counterbalance false positive signals.","Ratnayake, Ruwan; Tammaro, Meghan; Tiffany, Amanda; Kongelf, Anine; Polonsky, Jonathan A; McClelland, Amanda",Lancet Planet Health,393,1

A convenience sample of 100 dairies throughout California, providing a study population of 4,636 calves, were visited between May 2014 and April 2016. During each farm visit, in-person interviews with the herd manager or calf caretaker were conducted to collect information about herd demographics, maternity pen, colostrum and calf management, herd vaccinations, and dust abatement. A random sample of preweaned calves was identified and evaluated for the presence of BRD using a standardized tool. A survey-adjusted generalized linear mixed model with a logit link function was fitted with calf as the unit of analysis and dairy as the random effect. Mean study herd size (±SE) was 1,718 (±189.9) cows. Survey-adjusted estimates of breed types in the sample were 81.6% (±0.6) Holstein, 13.1% (±0.4) Jersey, and 5.3% (±0.5) crossbred or other purebred breeds, and calf sex proportions were 73.8% (±1.0) female and 26.2% (±1.0) male. Overall survey-adjusted BRD prevalence in the study herds was 6.91% (±0.69). Housing factors positively associated with BRD were metal hutches compared with wood hutches [odds ratio (OR) = 11.19; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.80–44.78], calf-to-calf contact in calves >75 d of age (OR = 9.95, 95% CI = 1.50–65.86), feeding Holstein calves <2.84 L of milk or replacer per day (OR = 7.16, 95% CI = 1.23–41.68), and lagoon water used for flushing manure under hutches compared with no flush (OR = 12.06, 95% CI = 1.93–75.47).

Vietnam is affected by high rates of antimicrobial resistant infections, driven by the overuse of antibiotics and the Vietnamese government has recognised antimicrobial resistance as a health security priority. This study aimed to understand how people in Vietnam use antibiotics in community settings, and the factors that impact their practices and decision-making regarding antibiotics. METHODS: We conducted 43 qualitative in-depth interviews with 50 community members in two urban and two rural sites in Vietnam. We conducted iterative, inductive thematic analysis alongside data collection through a process of systematic debriefings based on detailed interview summaries. Through this process, we developed a coding framework that was then applied to transcribed interview data. RESULTS: Frequent and indiscriminate use of antibiotics was driven by the powerful appeal that antibiotics held for many Vietnamese consumers. Consumers were discerning in making decisions in their purchase and use of antibiotics. Consumers’ decisions were affected by perceptions of what constitutes high-quality medicine (effective, strong, accessible and affordable); privileging symptom control over diagnosis; social constructions of antibiotics as a trusted remedy with embodied evidence of prior efficacy, which is reinforced by advice from trusted sources in their community; and varied, generally incomplete, understanding of the concept of antibiotic resistance and its implications for individuals and for public health. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic use at the community and primary care level in Vietnam is driven by community members’ social and economic response to what constitutes effective healthcare, rather than biomedical logic. Community-based interventions to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use need to engage with the entangled socio-structural factors that ‘resist’ current public health efforts to ration antibiotic use, alongside biomedical drivers. This study has informed the design of a community-based trial to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.","McKinn, Shannon; Trinh, Duy Hoang; Drabarek, Dorothy; Trieu, Thao Thu; Nguyen, Phuong Thi Lan; Cao, Thai Hung; Dang, Anh Duc; Nguyen, Thu Anh; Fox, Greg J; Bernays, Sarah",BMJ Glob Health,393,20

Fifteen children with median age of 8.8 (IQR 6.4–11.2) years were included, all were from African/Afro-Caribbean, South Asian, Mixed or other minority ethnic groups. All showed raised inflammatory/cardiac markers (CRP, ferritin, Troponin I, CK and pro-BNP). Transient valve regurgitation was present in 10 patients (67%). Left Ventricular ejection fraction was reduced in 12 (80%), fractional shortening in 8 (53%) with resolution in all but 2. Fourteen (93%) had coronary artery abnormalities, with normalization in 6. ECG abnormalities were present in 9 (60%) which normalized in 6 by discharge. Ten (67%) needed inotropes and/or vasopressors. None needed extracorporeal life support. Improvement in cardiac biochemical markers was closely followed by improvement in ECG/echocardiogram. All patients were discharged alive and twelve (80%) have been reviewed since. Our entire cohort with PIMS-TS had cardiac involvement and this degree of involvement is significantly more than other published series and emphasizes the need for specialist cardiac review.

In-depth interviews with 14 core policy elites from four health areas were conducted. As governance is a multidimensional concept, interviewees were asked to evaluate different dimensions based on the World Bank’s five elements (Coherent decision-making structures, Consistency and Stability, Stakeholder participation, Supervision and Regulation, and Transparency and Information). Overall, the new payment system was perceived as poorly governed. Since its introduction, it has not offered a new governance perspective because it used a conventional top-down approach, while political windows for cooperation were not wide open. Of the five governance dimensions, the scores were lowest in Stakeholder participation. There was a large perception gap between physicians and government officers here. Participants from academia perceived Consistency and Stability as ineffectively governed. In the meantime, the government has mainly created health policy in Korea. As a result, stakeholder participation, especially the participation of medical personnel, has been insufficient in the process of health policy formulation.

The structural glycoprotein, VP7, a 38-kD integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), presumably transfers to virus in this process. The gene for VP7 potentially encodes a protein of 326 amino acids which has two tandem hydrophobic domains at the NH2-terminal, each preceded by an in- frame ATG codon. A series of deletion mutants constructed from a full- length cDNA clone of the Simian 11 rotavirus VP7 gene were expressed in COS 7 cells. Products from wild-type, and mutants which did not affect the second hydrophobic domain of VP7, were localized by immunofluorescence to elements of the ER only. However, deletions affecting the second hydrophobic domain (mutants 42-61, 43-61, 47-61) showed immunofluorescent localization of VP7 which coincided with that of wheat germ agglutinin, indicating transport to the Golgi apparatus. Immunoprecipitable wild-type protein, or an altered protein lacking the first hydrophobic sequence, remained intracellular and endo-beta-N- acetylglucosaminidase H sensitive. In contrast, products of mutants 42- 61, 43-61, and 47-61 were transported from the ER, and secreted. Glycosylation of the secreted molecules was inhibited by tunicamycin, resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion and therefore of the N-linked complex type. An unglycosylated version of VP7 was also secreted. We suggest that the second hydrophobic domain contributes to a positive signal for ER location and a membrane anchor function. Secretion of the mutant glycoprotein implies that transport can be constitutive with the destination being dictated by an overriding compartmentalization signal.",,J Cell Biol,393,32

India accounts for 23 per cent of global pneumonia burden with case fatality rates between 14 and 30 per cent, and Streptococcus pneumoniae is considered a major bacterial aetiology. Emerging pathogens like Burkholderia pseudomallei is increasingly recognized as an important cause of CAP in Southeast Asian countries. Initial management in the primary care depends on clinical assessment while the hospitalized patients require combinations of clinical scores, chest radiography and various microbiological and biomarker assays. This comprehensive diagnostic approach together with additional sampling and molecular tests in selected high-risk patients should be practiced. Inappropriate therapy in CAP in hospitalized patients lengthens hospital stay and increases cost and mortality. In addition, emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms poses tough challenges in deciding empirical as well as definitive therapy. Developing local evidence on the cause and management should be a priority to improve health outcomes in CAP.","Eshwara, Vandana Kalwaje; Mukhopadhyay, Chiranjay; Rello, Jordi",Indian J Med Res,393,1

Assessment and treatment of COVID-19 associated hyperinflammation may be key to improve outcomes. It was speculated that in subgroups of patients secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) or cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with features of macrophage activation syndrome might drive severe disease trajectories. If confirmed, profound immunosuppressive therapy would be a rationale treatment approach. Over a median observation period of 11 (IQR: 8; 16) days, 19 consecutive confirmed severe COVID-19-patients admitted to our intensive-care-unit were tested for presence of sHLH by two independent experts. HScores and 2004-HLH diagnostic criteria were assessed. Patients were grouped according to short-term clinical courses: discharge from ICU versus ongoing ARDS or death at time of analysis. The median HScore at admission was 157 (IQR: 98;180), without the key clinical triad of HLH, i.e. progressive cytopenia, persistent fever and organomegaly. Independent expert chart review revealed the absence of sHLH in all cases. No patient reached more than 3/6 of modified HLH 2004 criteria. Nevertheless, patients presented hyperinflammation with peripheral neutrophilic signatures (neutrophil/lymphocyte-ratio > 3.5). The latter best paralleled their short-term clinical courses, with declining relative neutrophil numbers prior to extubation (4.4, [IQR: 2.5;6.3]; n = 8) versus those with unfavourable courses (7.6, [IQR: 5.2;31], n = 9). Our study rules out virus induced sHLH as the leading cause of most severe-COVID-19 trajectories. Instead, an associated innate neutrophilic hyperinflammatory response or virus-associated-CRS appears dominant in patients with an unfavourable clinical course. Therapeutic implications are discussed.","Lorenz, Georg; Moog, Philipp; Bachmann, Quirin; La Rosée, Paul; Schneider, Heike; Schlegl, Michaela; Spinner, Christoph; Heemann, Uwe; Schmid, Roland M.; Algül, Hana; Lahmer, Tobias; Huber, Wolfgang; Schmaderer, Christoph",Sci Rep,393,1

Challenges arise concerning how to optimally support the immune system in the general population, especially under self-confinement. An optimal immune response depends on an adequate diet and nutrition in order to keep infection at bay. For example, sufficient protein intake is crucial for optimal antibody production. Low micronutrient status, such as of vitamin A or zinc, has been associated with increased infection risk. Frequently, poor nutrient status is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn can impact the immune system. Dietary constituents with especially high anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacity include vitamin C, vitamin E, and phytochemicals such as carotenoids and polyphenols. Several of these can interact with transcription factors such as NF-kB and Nrf-2, related to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, respectively. Vitamin D in particular may perturb viral cellular infection via interacting with cell entry receptors (angiotensin converting enzyme 2), ACE2. Dietary fiber, fermented by the gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids, has also been shown to produce anti-inflammatory effects. In this review, we highlight the importance of an optimal status of relevant nutrients to effectively reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby strengthening the immune system during the COVID-19 crisis.","Iddir, Mohammed; Brito, Alex; Dingeo, Giulia; Fernandez Del Campo, Sofia Sosa; Samouda, Hanen; La Frano, Michael R.; Bohn, Torsten",Nutrients,393,6

If teachers embrace online learning and customize their approaches to make online resources accessible to students, the interactive and collaborative nature of online learning may help reduce the lack of interaction in large classes and isolation in distance education. Research reports the need to examine the accessibility of online learning through the lenses of the digital divide dependence on factors related to physical access, skills and motivational factors. The circumstances of the pandemic have revealed inequality in access to education caused by access to technology and online delivery in which teaching approaches may not necessarily address the student voice with appreciation of their culture.
