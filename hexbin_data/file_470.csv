1507,Increased survival of cirrhotic patients with septic shock,2013-04-19,"INTRODUCTION: The overall outcome of septic shock has been recently improved. We sought to determine whether this survival gain extends to the high-risk subgroup of patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: Cirrhotic patients with septic shock admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) during two consecutive periods (1997-2004 and 2005-2010) were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: Forty-seven and 42 cirrhotic patients presented with septic shock in 1997-2004 and 2005-2010, respectively. The recent period differed from the previous one by implementation of adjuvant treatments of septic shock including albumin infusion as fluid volume therapy, low-dose glucocorticoids, and intensive insulin therapy. ICU and hospital survival markedly improved over time (40% in 2005-2010 vs. 17% in 1997-2004, P = 0.02 and 29% in 2005-2010 vs. 6% in 1997-2004, P = 0.009, respectively). Furthermore, this survival gain in the latter period was sustained for 6 months (survival rate 24% in 2005-2010 vs. 6% in 1997-2004, P = 0.06). After adjustment with age, the liver disease stage (Child-Pugh score), and the critical illness severity score (SOFA score), ICU admission between 2005 and 2010 remained an independent favorable prognostic factor (odds ratio (OR) 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.4, P = 0.004). The stage of the underlying liver disease was also independently associated with hospital mortality (Child-Pugh score: OR 1.42 per point, 95% CI 1.06-1.9, P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: In the light of advances in management of both cirrhosis and septic shock, survival of such patients substantially increased over recent years. The stage of the underlying liver disease and the related therapeutic options should be included in the decision-making process for ICU admission.","Sauneuf, Bertrand; Champigneulle, Benoit; Soummer, Alexis; Mongardon, Nicolas; Charpentier, Julien; Cariou, Alain; Chiche, Jean-Daniel; Mallet, Vincent; Mira, Jean-Paul; Pène, Frédéric",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4057386/,470
5190,The Short Health Anxiety Inventory: Psychometric Properties and Construct Validity in a Non-clinical Sample,2007-02-15,"Evidence for the involvement of viruses,Mycoplasma pneumoniae, andChlamydia spp. was studied by the complement fixation test in paired sera from 310 young adults (297 men and 13 women) with acute maxillary sinusitis. The diagnosis of acute sinusitis was confirmed by radiography and sinus puncture. Elevated antibody titres were found in 102 patients (33%). A four fold or greater titre rise was detected in 21.5%, and a high stable titre suggestive of recent viral infection was present in a further 11.5%. Adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, andMycoplasma pneumoniae accounted for most of the elevated antibody titres. Elevated titres were found in 79 (32%) of the 245 patients with purulent maxillary sinusitis (pathogenic bacteria isolated in sinus secretion) and in 23 (35%) of the 65 patients with non-purulent sinusitis (no pathogenic bacteria isolated). About 90% of the fourfold or greater titre rises in bacteriologically negative cases were due to adeno- or influenza viruses. A fourfold rise in antibody titre was also found in 7 of 101 control patients (7%). The results of this study suggest that respiratory viruses andMycoplasma pneumoniae may be potential etiological agents in acute maxillary sinusitis, either alone or in combination with the common bacterial pathogens of sinusitis.","Savolainen, S.; Jousimies-Somer, H.; Kleemola, M.; Ylikoski, J.",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088065/,470

11059,Cumulative Antenatal Risk and Kindergarten Readiness in Preterm-Born Preschoolers,2019-08-16,"Neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and vascular dementia (VCID) have no disease-modifying treatments to date and now constitute a dementia crisis that affects 5 million in the USA and over 50 million worldwide. The most common pathological hallmark of these age-related neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of specific proteins, including amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, α-synuclein (α-syn), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43), and repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) peptides, in the intra- and extracellular spaces of selected brain regions. Whereas it remains controversial whether these accumulations are pathogenic or merely a byproduct of disease, the majority of therapeutic research has focused on clearing protein aggregates. Immunotherapies have garnered particular attention for their ability to target specific protein strains and conformations as well as promote clearance. Immunotherapies can also be neuroprotective: by neutralizing extracellular protein aggregates, they reduce spread, synaptic damage, and neuroinflammation. This review will briefly examine the current state of research in immunotherapies against the 3 most commonly targeted proteins for age-related neurodegenerative disease: Aβ, tau, and α-syn. The discussion will then turn to combinatorial strategies that enhance the effects of immunotherapy against aggregating protein, followed by new potential targets of immunotherapy such as aging-related processes.

17227,A User-Centered Chatbot (Wakamola) to Collect Linked Data in Population Networks to Support Studies of Overweight and Obesity Causes: Design and Pilot Study,2021-04-14,"BACKGROUND: Cisgender female sex workers (FSWs) experience high rates of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including chlamydia and gonorrhea. Community empowerment–based responses to the risk environment of FSWs have been associated with significant reductions in HIV and STI risk and associated risk behaviors; however, evaluations of US-based interventions targeting FSWs are limited. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe the design, implementation, and planned evaluation strategy of an ongoing comprehensive community-level intervention in Baltimore City, Maryland, which aims to improve HIV and STI risk and cumulative incidence among FSWs. The two intervention components are the SPARC (Sex Workers Promoting Action, Risk Reduction, and Community Mobilization) drop-in center and the accompanying comprehensive mobile outreach program. The mission of SPARC is to provide low-barrier harm reduction services to FSWs, with a special focus on women who sell sex and use drugs. Services are provided through a harm reduction framework and include reproductive health and sexual health care; medication-assisted treatment; legal aid; counseling; showers, lockers, and laundry; and the distribution of harm reduction tools, including naloxone and sterile drug use supplies (eg, cookers, cotton, syringes, and pipes). METHODS: The SPARC intervention is being evaluated through the EMERALD (Enabling Mobilization, Empowerment, Risk Reduction, and Lasting Dignity) study, which consists of a prospective 2-group comparative nonrandomized trial (n=385), a cross-sectional survey (n=100), and in-depth interviews assessing SPARC implementation (n=45). Participants enrolled in the nonrandomized trial completed a survey and HIV and STI testing at 4 intervals (baseline and 6, 12, and 18 months). Participants recruited from predefined areas closest to SPARC comprised the intervention group, and participants from all other areas of Baltimore were included in the control group. RESULTS: We hypothesize that addressing structural drivers and more immediate medical needs, in combination with peer outreach, will improve the HIV and STI risk environment, leading to community empowerment, and reduce the HIV and STI cumulative incidence and behavioral risks of FSWs. Data collection is ongoing. A baseline description of the cohort is presented. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, structural interventions aimed at reducing HIV and STIs among FSWs are scarce; to our knowledge, this is the first intervention of its kind in the United States. The results of the EMERALD study can be used to inform the development of future interventions targeting FSWs and other at-risk populations.

Non-contact-based measurements of both breathing rate and changes in breathing rate help monitor health condition of subjects more flexibly. In this paper, we present an improved real-time camera-based adaptive breathing monitoring system, which includes real time (1) adaptive breathing motion detection, (2) adaptive region of interest detection to eliminate environmental noise, (3) breathing and body movement classification, (4) respiration rate estimation, (5) monitor change in respiration rate to examine overall health of an individual, and (6) online adaptation to lighting. The proposed system does not pose any positional and postural constraint. For evaluation, 30 videos of 15 animals are tested with drugs to simulate various medical conditions and breathing patterns, and the results from the proposed system are compared with the outputs of an existing FDA-approved invasive medical system for patient monitoring. The results show that the proposed method performs significantly correlated RR results to the reference medical device with the correlation coefficient equal to 0.92 and p-value less than 0.001, and more importantly the proposed video-based method is demonstrated to produce alarms 10 to 20 s earlier than the benchmark medical device.","Lee, Yu-Ching; Syakura, Abdan; Khalil, Muhammad Adil; Wu, Ching-Ho; Ding, Yi-Fang; Wang, Ching-Wei",Med Biol Eng Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8185321/,470
18509,Effective Training Data Extraction Method to Improve Influenza Outbreak Prediction from Online News Articles: Deep Learning Model Study,2021-05-25,"Yoga is an ancient Indian technique of healthy living. Numerous studies have corroborated yoga's beneficial effects, including a favorable influence on autonomic function and negative emotions. Extensive research in the last few decades has revealed the critical role that yoga can play in eradicating stress. This has laid to the foundation for a scientific understanding of pathophysiological changes attributed to stress, particularly at the molecular and genetic levels. This primarily has helped understand the epigenetic and genetic mechanism at play to induce and alleviate stress, particularly those related to emotional aberrations. As research has indicated, negative emotions are translated into vascular inflammation appropriately accentuated by a sympathetic predominant autonomic function. This cascade is bolstered by multiple factors, including activation of “stressor” genes and elaborating hormones, including steroids with sometimes nocuous consequences, particularly when chronic. Yoga has been categorically found to have inhibited each and every one of these baneful effects of stress. In fact, it also changes the neuronal circuits that potentiate such a plethora of pathological changes. This, in turn, has accentuated yoga's relevance as a powerful preventive intervention in noncommunicable diseases (NCD). NCDs, including heart disease, stroke, and rheumatological disorders, are essentially inflammatory diseases that perpetuate inflammation in different beds like vascular or joint spaces. The precise mechanism by which yoga induces such beneficial changes is yet to be delineated. However, a cornucopia of pointers indicates that neural, endocrine, immunological, cellular, genetic, and epigenetic mechanisms are at play. This article attempts to cobble together newfangled research to delineate a medical model for this 5000-year-old practice from India. This is imperative, as a mechanistic model of this ancient-but-complex system would enable a more comprehensive understanding of its mechanism and reveal its yet-undiscovered positive health effects.","Basu-Ray, Indranill",Int J Yoga,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8191226/,470
19342,The Effect of Ocular Perfusion Pressure on Retinal Thickness in Young People with Presumed Systemic Hypotension,2021-07-14,"Acute myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium, and it can present as severe heart failure in children. Differential diagnosis with genetic cardiomyopathy can be difficult. The objective of this study is to identify patterns of clinical presentation and to assess invasive and non-invasive measures to differentiate patients with acute myocarditis from patients with dilated genetic cardiomyopathy. We performed a retrospective descriptive study of all paediatric patients (0–16 years old) that presented with new-onset heart failure with left ventricle ejection fraction < 35% in whom we performed an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) during the period from April 2007 to December 2020. The patients were classified into two groups: Group 1 included 18 patients with myocarditis. Group 2 included 9 patients with genetic cardiomyopathy. Findings favouring a diagnosis of myocarditis included a fulminant or acute presentation (77.8% vs 33.3%, p = 0.01), higher degree of cardiac enzyme elevation (p = 0.011), lower left ventricular dimension z-score (2.2 vs 5.4, p = 0.03) increase of ventricular wall thickness (88.8% vs 33.3%, p = 0.03) and oedema in the EMB. Seven (77.8%) patients with genetic cardiomyopathy had inflammation in the endomyocardial biopsy fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Conclusion: Differentiating patients with a myocarditis from those with genetic cardiomyopathy can be challenging, even performing an EMB. Some patients with genetic cardiomyopathy fulfil the diagnostic criteria of inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Using invasive and non-invasive measures may be useful to develop a predictive model to differentiate myocarditis from genetic cardiomyopathy.

The overexpressed proteins, including EGFR, PI3K, AKT1, and CDK4, have a role in the growth of breast cancer cells. The 3D peptide structure of sea cucumber Cucumaria frondosa was modeled and then docked with EGFR, PI3K, AKT1, and CDK4 proteins using AutoDock Vina software. The docking result, which has the best binding affinity value, is continued with molecular dynamics simulation. The docking results showed that all peptides bind to the active sites of the four proteins. WPPNYQW and YDWRF peptides bind to proteins with lower binding affinity values than positive controls. The four proteins were in a stable state when complexed with the WPPNYQW peptide, which was seen from the RMSD and RMSF value. PI3K-YDWRF and AKT1-YDWRF complexes are stable, characterized by high RMSD values and increased volatility in several amino acids. WPPNYQW peptide has high potential as an antibreast cancer agent because it binds to the active sites of the four proteins with low binding affinity values and stable interactions. Meanwhile, the YDWRF peptide interacts with the four proteins with low binding affinity values, but the interaction is only stable on PI3K and AKT1 proteins.","Wargasetia, Teresa Liliana; Ratnawati, Hana; Widodo, Nashi; Widyananda, Muhammad Hermawan",Cancer Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8283226/,470

Animal studies have shown a positive effect of vitamin D(3) supplementation on fracture healing, but evidence from clinical trials is inconclusive. A randomized controlled trial was performed to assess the effects of vitamin D(3) supplementation on fracture healing using HR‐pQCT–based outcome parameters. Thirty‐two postmenopausal women with a conservatively treated distal radius fracture were included within 2 weeks postfracture and randomized to a low‐dose (N = 10) and a high‐dose (N = 11) vitamin D intervention group receiving a 6‐week bolus dose, equivalent to 700 and 1800 IU vitamin D(3) supplementation per day, respectively, in addition to a control group (N = 11) receiving no supplementation. After the baseline visit 1–2 weeks postfracture, follow‐up visits were scheduled at 3–4, 6–8, and 12 weeks postfracture. At each visit, HR‐pQCT scans of the fractured radius were performed. Cortical and trabecular bone density and microarchitectural parameters and microfinite element analysis–derived torsion, compression, and bending stiffness were assessed. Additionally, serum markers of bone resorption (CTX) and bone formation (PINP) were measured. Baseline serum levels of 25OHD(3) were <50 nmol/L in 33% of all participants and <75 nmol/L in 70%. Compared with the control group, high‐dose vitamin D(3) supplementation resulted in a decreased trabecular number (regression coefficient β: −0.22; p < 0.01) and lower compression stiffness (B: −3.63; p < 0.05, together with an increase in the bone resorption marker CTX (B: 0.062; p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were observed between the control and low‐dose intervention group. In conclusion, the bolus equivalent of 700 U/day vitamin D(3) supplementation in a Western postmenopausal population does not improve distal radius fracture healing and an equivalent dose of 1800 IU/day may be detrimental in restoring bone stiffness during the first 12 weeks of fracture healing. © 2021 The Authors.

21830,Association between delay in intensive care unit admission and the host response in patients with community-acquired pneumonia,2021-09-28,"BACKGROUND: Thiamine metabolism dysfunction syndrome 4 (THMD4, OMIM #613710) is an autosomal recessive inherited disease caused by the deficiency of SLC25A19 that encodes the mitochondrial thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) transporter. This disorder is characterized by bilateral striatal degradation and progressive polyneuropathy with the onset of fever of unknown origin. The limited number of reported cases and lack of functional annotation of related gene variants continue to limit diagnosis. RESULTS: We report three cases of encephalopathy from two unrelated pedigrees with basal ganglia signal changes after fever of unknown origin. To distinguish this from other types of encephalopathy, such as acute necrotizing encephalopathy, exome sequencing was performed, and four novel heterozygous variations, namely, c.169G>A (p.Ala57Thr), c.383C>T (p.Ala128Val), c.76G>A (p.Gly26Arg), and c.745T>A (p.Phe249Ile), were identified in SLC25A19. All variants were confirmed using Sanger sequencing. To determine the pathogenicity of these variants, functional studies were performed. We found that mitochondrial TPP levels were significantly decreased in the presence of SLC25A19 variants, indicating that TPP transport activities of mutated SLC25A19 proteins were impaired. Thus, combining clinical phenotype, genetic analysis, and functional studies, these variants were deemed as likely pathogenic. CONCLUSIONS: Exome sequencing analysis enables molecular diagnosis as well as provides potential etiology. Further studies will enable the elucidation of SLC25A19 protein function. Our investigation supplied key molecular evidence for the precise diagnosis of and clinical decision-making for a rare disease.","Chen, Yuanying; Fang, Boliang; Hu, Xuyun; Guo, Ruolan; Guo, Jun; Fang, Kenan; Ni, Jingwen; Li, Wei; Qian, Suyun; Hao, Chanjuan",Orphanet J Rare Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8480130/,470

We then applied an admixture-aware method to identify 220 SVs exhibiting extreme patterns of frequency differentiation – a signature of local adaptation. The top two variants traced to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, tagging a haplotype that swept to near fixation in certain southeast Asian populations, but is rare in other global populations. Further investigation revealed evidence that the haplotype traces to gene flow from Neanderthals, corroborating the role of immune-related genes as prominent targets of adaptive introgression.

22102,Assessing Perceptions of Broad Consent Concerning Biological Specimen Collection in a Cohort of Young Sexual Minority Men,2021-10-06,"IMPORTANCE: Low-value health care remains prevalent in the US despite decades of work to measure and reduce such care. Efforts have been only modestly effective in part because the measurement of low-value care has largely been restricted to the national or regional level, limiting actionability. OBJECTIVES: To measure and report low-value care use across and within individual health systems and identify system characteristics associated with higher use using Medicare administrative data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study of health system–attributed Medicare beneficiaries was conducted among 556 health systems in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Compendium of US Health Systems and included system-attributed beneficiaries who were older than 65 years, continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B for at least 12 months in 2016 or 2017, and eligible for specific low-value services. Statistical analysis was conducted from January 26 to July 15, 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Use of 41 individual low-value services and a composite measure of the 28 most common services among system-attributed beneficiaries, standardized to distance from the mean value. Measures were based on the Milliman MedInsight Health Waste Calculator and published claims-based definitions. RESULTS: Across 556 health systems serving a total of 11 637 763 beneficiaries, the mean (SD) use of each of the 41 low-value services ranged from 0% (0.01%) to 28% (4%) of eligible beneficiaries. The most common low-value services were preoperative laboratory testing (mean [SD] rate, 28% [4%] of eligible beneficiaries), prostate-specific antigen testing in men older than 70 years (mean [SD] rate, 27% [8%]), and use of antipsychotic medications in patients with dementia (mean [SD] rate, 24% [8%]). In multivariable analysis, the health system characteristics associated with higher use of low-value care were smaller proportion of primary care physicians (adjusted composite score, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.04-0.26] for systems with less than the median percentage of primary care physicians vs −0.16 [95% CI, –0.27 to –0.05] for those with more than the median percentage of primary care physicians; P < .001), no major teaching hospital (adjusted composite, 0.10 [95% CI, –0.01 to 0.20] without a teaching hospital vs −0.18 [95% CI, –0.34 to –0.02] with a teaching hospital; P = .01), larger proportion of non-White patients (adjusted composite, 0.15 [95% CI, –0.02 to 0.32] for systems with >20% of non-White beneficiaries vs −0.06 [95% CI, –0.16 to 0.03] for systems with ≤20% of non-White beneficiaries; P = .04), headquartered in the South or West (adjusted composite, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.14-0.43] for the South and 0.22 [95% CI, 0.02-0.42] for the West compared with −0.09 [95% CI, –0.26 to 0.08] for the Northeast and −0.44 [95% CI, –0.60 to –0.28] for the Midwest; P < .001), and serving areas with more health care spending (adjusted composite, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.11-0.35] for areas above the median level of spending vs −0.24 [95% CI, –0.36 to –0.12] for areas below the median level of spending; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this large cohort study suggest that system-level measurement and reporting of specific low-value services is feasible, enables cross-system comparisons, and reveals a broad range of low-value care use.","Ganguli, Ishani; Morden, Nancy E.; Yang, Ching-Wen Wendy; Crawford, Maia; Colla, Carrie H.",JAMA Internal Medicine,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/articlepdf/2784487/jamainternal_ganguli_2021_oi_210056_1631897325.02222.pdf,470

Canada has committed itself to safety, environmental protection and sovereign presence in the area by maintaining joint SAR centres of federal government departments and mobilizing private volunteers. The characteristics of Canadian SAR response in the Arctic rest with its high dependency on heavy equipment such as aircraft, helicopters and icebreakers, entailing prolonged hours of response time. As recent climate change impacts and maritime traffic increase in the northern waters disclose safety gaps, innovation in SAR assets is anticipated. The safety gaps may be filled by state-of-the-art remote control technology. This chapter discusses remotely operated unmanned ships for SAR response, exploring their opportunities, risk dimensions and governance implications.","Yoo, Jinho; Goerlandt, Floris; Chircop, Aldo",Governance of Arctic Shipping,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7418145/,470

Given the inhibitory role of Butanedione Monoxime (BDM) on myosin–actin interaction, this study aimed to investigate the effects of this molecule on the vitality and infectivity of Toxoplasma tachyzoites in order to provide a new option for vaccine development. The tachyzoites of the RH strain of Toxoplasma gondii were exposed to different concentrations (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 μg/mL) of BDM, and mortality effect was assessed by flow cytometry. Then, the penetration ability of the tachyzoites was investigated in HeLa and macrophage cell lines. The infectivity of exposed tachyzoites to BDM were also investigated in mice through following up and detecting the etiological factor. The highest percentage of mortality (72.69%) was seen in the tachyzoites exposed to 128 μg/mL of the compound. The tachyzoites exposed to 32, 64, and 128 μg/mL of BDM began the proliferation in HeLa cells after 48 h, while this proliferation was initiated within 24 h in macrophage cells. All the mice inoculated with the BDM-treated tachyzoites died after 13 days. The mean survival time of the mice receiving tachyzoites exposed to 128 μg/mL of BDM was 12.4 days, which was significantly different from the negative control group (p = 0.001). BDM, as the inhibitor of myosin–actin interaction, and other substances that block the entry of parasites into cells may be suitable candidates for vaccine production against Toxoplasma. Yet, future studies are required to be conducted on the issue.","Bajelan, Sara; Bahreini, Mohammad Saleh; Asgari, Qasem; Mikaeili, Fattaneh",J Parasit Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7430933/,470

40626,Covid-19: Cultural Perspectives,2020-10-09,"ISSUE: Malnutrition in all its forms poses daunting challenges to global health and development. The agriculture sector is a significant contributor to global warming. COVID-19 has pushed many people into poverty, including food poverty. A radical rethink of business models, food systems, civil society involvement, and national and international governance is required to address the interlinked crises of COVID-19, obesity, undernutrition, and climate change. International human rights law, institutions and mechanisms provide important opportunities for norm setting, advocacy and accountability. Yet these pathways are under-utilised by both governments and civil society. DESCRIPTION: The global AIDS response demonstrated the power of a human rights-based approach. United Nations' HIV/AIDS and Human Rights Guidelines greatly influenced the global consensus for effective, evidence-based approaches. The Guidelines also informed resolutions of the UN General Assembly and its Human Rights Council, contributing to more affordable medicines, an unprecedented increase in people on treatment, less stigmatising health services, the empowerment of marginalised groups, and the institutionalisation of norms, including “no one left behind.” Human rights-based approaches have also been successfully utilised in tobacco control. RESULTS: In 2019, 180 experts from 38 countries published an open call on WHO and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to initiate an inclusive process to develop guidelines on human rights, healthy diets and sustainable food systems. Most signatories were from the health and development sectors, demonstrating the increasingly broad interest in using human rights mechanisms to address global health challenges. LESSONS: Opportunities exist to transform food systems and create healthier food environments and a healthier planet by clarifying existing international obligations to progressively realise the right to food and the right to health. KEY MESSAGES: Market forces, alone, are failing to deliver healthy diets and sustainable food systems. International legal frameworks and accountability mechanisms provide opportunities for engagement and action. Human rights guidelines can help mobilize multisectoral action, strengthen State and private sector accountability, and deepen community engagement in the urgent task of achieving Agenda 2030.","Patterson, D W; Buse, K; Magnusson, R; Toebes, B C A",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543390/,470
42066,Affirming Radical Equality in the Context of COVID-19: Human Rights of Older People and People with Disabilities,2020-10-14,"Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a practical diagnostic tool for several lung pathologies. Pocket sized USG devices (PSUDs) are more affordable, accessible, practical, and learning to use them is easier than standard ultrasound devices (SUDs). Their capability in image quality have been found as comparable with standard USG machines. Studies have been showing that these devices can be useful as much as SUDs in the evaluation of heart, abdomen, vascular structures, diaphragm and optic nerve. The aim of this study is to compare PSUD with a standard ultrasound devices (SUD) in the evaluation of LUS patterns such as alveolar, interstitial syndromes and lung aeration score (LAS). Study performed in an University Hospital Pulmonary ICU. All patients older than 18 years old were included in this study. The sector probe of SUD (Vivid-Q) and PSUD (Vscan) were used for investigation of A lines, interstitial (B lines), alveolar syndromes (consolidation, hepatisation, air bronchograms) and pleural effusion. 33 patients were included in the study. When PSUD was compared with SUD in terms of total B2 count, and LAS in the right, left and both lung, there was an agreement without proportional bias according to Bland Altman test. There was also good inter class correlation coefficient value as greater than 0.8 and 0.7 between two physicians in terms of counting of total B1, B2, total B lines and calculating of total LAS for SUD and PSUD respectively. PSUDs is a reliable and valid method for evaluation of LUS patterns like SUDs.","Güney, Tuba; Gürsel, Gül; Özdemir, Uğur; Tekin, Ömer; Çimen, Meltem; Mamadova, Ayşen; Karaaslan, Nur",J Clin Monit Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7653453/,470

EFFECTS OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON NEUROSURGICAL ONCOLOGY PRACTICES AT INOVA HEALTH SYSTEM: AN INSTITUTIONAL EXPERIENCE,2020-11-09,"Homeostatic control of neuronal excitability by modulation of synaptic inhibition (I) and excitation (E) of the principal neurons is important during brain maturation. The fundamental features of in-utero brain development, including local synaptic E–I ratio and bioenergetics, can be modeled by cerebral organoids (CO) that have exhibited highly regular nested oscillatory network events. Therefore, we evaluated a 'Phase Zero' clinical study platform combining broadband Vis/near-infrared(NIR) spectroscopy and electrophysiology with studying E–I ratio based on the spectral exponent of local field potentials and bioenergetics based on the activity of mitochondrial Cytochrome-C Oxidase (CCO). We found a significant effect of the age of the healthy controls iPSC CO from 23 days to 3 months on the CCO activity (chi-square (2, N = 10) = 20, p = 4.5400e−05), and spectral exponent between 30–50 Hz (chi-square (2, N = 16) = 13.88, p = 0.001). Also, a significant effect of drugs, choline (CHO), idebenone (IDB), R-alpha-lipoic acid plus acetyl-l-carnitine (LCLA), was found on the CCO activity (chi-square (3, N = 10) = 25.44, p = 1.2492e−05), spectral exponent between 1 and 20 Hz (chi-square (3, N = 16) = 43.5, p = 1.9273e−09) and 30–50 Hz (chi-square (3, N = 16) = 23.47, p = 3.2148e−05) in 34 days old CO from schizophrenia (SCZ) patients iPSC. We present the feasibility of a multimodal approach, combining electrophysiology and broadband Vis–NIR spectroscopy, to monitor neurodevelopment in brain organoid models that can complement traditional drug design approaches to test clinically meaningful hypotheses.","Dutta, Anirban; Karanth, Sneha Sudhakar; Bhattacharya, Mahasweta; Liput, Michal; Augustyniak, Justyna; Cheung, Mancheung; Stachowiak, Ewa K.; Stachowiak, Michal K.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7710726/,470

43281,The Limitations of Online Surveys,2020-10-13,"While the Anthropocene is often discussed in terms of the health of the planet, there has been less attention paid to its impact on the health of humans. We argue that there is now sufficient evidence of broad and growing adverse effects on human health to consider Anthropocene-related diseases and their impact on public health as a category of conditions needing specific recognition and preventative action. Using the examples of climate change-related health challenges, non-communicable disease, antimicrobial resistance and the unique challenges of the digital environment, we discuss how the profound and pervasive environmental changes of the Anthropocene can affect our health, with broad effects on societal health. We frame this concept in terms of human evolutionary history and cultural evolution’s runaway characteristics, reflecting our drive for continual and cumulative innovation for reasons beyond simply survival and Darwinian fitness. As the causative agents are often remote from those populations most adversely affected, prevention and mitigation require collective societal and policy actions. Lay summary: There is increasing evidence that our uniquely evolved ability to modify our environments rapidly and at an accelerating pace is having impacts on our health, particularly non-communicable diseases and poor mental wellbeing. Reframing these public health challenges as Anthropocene-related diseases emphasizes the need for collective responsibility and systems approaches to prevention.","Gluckman, Peter D; Low, Felicia M; Hanson, Mark A",Evol Med Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7723875/,470

It is also crucial to examine occupational level welfare since companies may restrict or expand the existing national-level regulations, defining the “final availability” workers actually have toward various arrangements. In addition, companies may provide various additional arrangements through occupational policies which are not set out in the national-level agreements that are crucial in addressing reconciliation needs of workers. This chapter examines what types of arrangements are provided at the company level to address work–family demands of workers. It further provides a synthesis of studies that examine both national-level contexts and individual-level characteristics that explain who gets access to company-level family-friendly policies, which is linked to the possible outcomes of these policies.","Chung, Heejung",The Palgrave Handbook of Family Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734955/,470

This dietary pattern alters the composition of gut microbiota, influencing brain function by different mechanisms involving the gut–brain axis. In addition, long-term exposure to highly palatable foods typical of WD could induce addictive-like eating behaviors and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation associated with chronic stress, anxiety, and depression. In turn, chronic stress modulates eating behavior, and it could have detrimental effects on different brain regions such as the hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and several cortical regions. Moreover, obesity and overweight induce neuroinflammation, causing neuronal dysfunction. In this review, we summarize the current scientific evidence about the mechanisms and factors relating WD consumption with altered brain function and behavior. Possible therapeutic interventions and limitations are also discussed, aiming to tackle and prevent this current pandemic.","López-Taboada, Isabel; González-Pardo, Héctor; Conejo, Nélida María",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7719696/,470

This chapter describes possibilities for and models of doctoral education that revisit its purposes and priorities towards these ends. In particular, it is argued that the parameters of dissertation research—the core component of student learning—should be broad enough to allow students to develop these attributes and that more student-centric, transformative, approaches to doctoral education are necessary.

In practice, it may be used to enforce the coding style and flag undesired syntax constructs, find logical mistakes, prove that the program satisfies its specification, apply domain-specific checks, or even verify cross-program compatibility. Those are all valid use cases that are required to be handled by the static analyzer, and the intermediate representation (IR) affects how can it be done. A typical compiler or analyzer uses a number of IRs, each of them helps with a specific problem. For our static analyzer project, we found that existing IRs partially do not match our requirements, which led to the creation of Midair—an IR for multi-purpose program analysis. It is positioned right between IRs created primarily for the compilation (like LLVM, MLIR, GIMPLE) and verification IRs (such as Boogie) with the hope that it would be both close to a low level and suitable for verification while applying to practical analysis tools. The IR consists of 4 layers, allowing for a transparent transformation between forms saving time and space. A flexible type system supporting non-machinery types and an ability to augment the representation with external metadata provided by solvers had been added. The application of Midair to our analysis framework uncovered advantages and non-critical issues, which are planned to be worked around.","Menshikov, Maxim",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974955/,470
50409,"Should Monrovian Communities Agree to Voluntary Slum Relocations: Land, Gender and Urban Governance",2020-11-12,"The focus of the satellite application market for many years has been on broadband services and especially on video services provided by large high-powered satellites located in geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO). This type of service, known in the parlance of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as broadcast satellite service (BSS), has been the top source of revenues. Companies providing direct broadcast satellite services have, in fact, produced over 70% of satellite service income. Today there is a burgeoning new market associated with digitally networked services that small satellite constellations might be able to provide with particular skill. Some of these services require only thin data streams and can be provided by quite small and cost-effective satellite networks. Others may demand much higher data rates and thus may be serviced by significantly higher data rates. The focus of this particular chapter is on messaging, machine-to-machine (M2M), automatic identification services (AIS), and new forms of satellite-based Internet of Things (IoT) services. These are the new types of services that much small satellite constellations with lower bit rates can provide. These new systems such as Orbcomm, Kepler, Spire, Else, Kineis, ELO, and others can be deployed at much lower cost than the bigger mini-satellite systems seeking to provide broadband services. They can also operate to much lower-cost omnidirectional ground terminals. It is possible that mini-satellite constellations with much higher-throughput rates optimized for 5G services and video via over the top data streaming services will create very large new multibillion dollar markets. These types of services, however, will be provided by larger types of small satellites configured to operate in higher data rate constellations. These services will be reserved for either GEO high-throughput satellites or mini-satellite constellations. This gigabit per second market, if served by small satellites, will be reserved for those megaconstellations being implemented by OneWeb, SpaceX’s Starlink, LeoSat, Boeing, Thales, and others. This chapter concentrates on the interactive satellite messaging services that deal in megabits per month rather than process information in gigabits/second.","Pelton, Joseph N.",Handbook of Small Satellites,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990662/,470

52750,Fr099 HEALTHCARE PROVIDER SATISFACTION WITH VIRTUAL CARE DELIVERY IN ALBERTA DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.,2021-05-10,"Studies sought epidemiological profiles to establish risk groups for Covid-19’s evolution and discovered that the age group above 65 years old is one of the most severely affected, due to the presence of other comorbidities. In the USA approximately 55 million individuals are above that age range and more than 23 million are elderly obese individuals, alongside the high mortality rate in this population and lack of proven effective medicine against Covid-19, therapeutic alternatives against this disease are sought. With the occurrence of inflammatory pulmonary conditions increased by SARS-Cov-2 infection, irisin was indicated as having a potential preventive action. This peptide is secreted endogenously by striated skeletal muscles with fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) proteolysis, when preceded by continued exercise of low to moderate intensity for more than 20 uninterrupted minutes. Regarding the weight variant, previous studies showed low levels of FNDC5 in people with excess fatty acids (in humans, adipose tissue divides into white, favoring the deposit of lipids, triglycerides and fat, more easily inflamed, and brown that stimulates thermogenesis). Among other functions, FNDC5 also stimulates the coactivator 1-alpha of PPAR gamma (PGC-1α) which corroborates with the uncoupling between the Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1) and the mitochondria. When UCP1 is disincorporated from this organelle, it becomes active and inhibits ATP synthesis, releasing heat, as well as favoring fatty acid oxidation and provides the mechanism of browning of white fat. After this conversion, irisin reduces ¼ of lipid accumulation present in the adipocyte by lipolysis, significantly increasing the levels of serum triglycerides and glycerols, as well as considerably reducing oxidative stress and DNA damage. Other genes expressed by irisin also assist in the fat browning process, such as TMEM26, ELOVL3, CIDEa and COX7a. Regarding the age variant, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein benefits from the high concentration of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, present in elderly pulmonary alveoli, which bind to the airway and enable contagion. However, ACE2 is negatively regulated by Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) protein from its connection to the nucleocapsid protein of the virus, generating some protection for the individual when TRIB3 is at satisfactory levels. In elderly men, this protein is below normal levels, making this population more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, it was verified that irisin’s weekly synthesis promoted by regular physical exercises triples TRIB3 levels in pulmonary alveoli. In short, this hormone was able to negatively modulate two important risk factors related to the inflammatory profile of this elderly population (weight and age), and thus irisin should be considered a potential molecule in the prevention against Covid-19.","de Oliveira, Arthu Línniker Lopes; Jales, Césia Santos; de Queiroz Silva, Igor Thiago Borges",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090671/,470
53292,110 The Results of Treatment of Acute Appendicitis During COVID-19 Pandemic in A District General Hospital,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims To quantify the risk of death among people with vasculitis during the UK 2020 COVID-19 epidemic compared with baseline risk, risk during annual influenza seasons and risk of death in the general population during COVID-19. Methods We performed a cohort study using data from the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) under their legal permissions (CAG 10-02(d)/2015). Coded diagnoses for vasculitis (ANCA-associated vasculitis, Takayasu arteritis, Behçet's disease, and giant cell arteritis) were identified from Hospital Episode Statistics from 2003 onwards. Previous coding validation work demonstrated a positive predictive value >85%. The main outcome measure was age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for all-cause death. ONS published data were used for general population mortality rates. Results We identified 55,110 people with vasculitis (median age 74.9 (IQR 64.1-82.7) years, 68.0% female) alive 01 March 2020. During March-April 2020, 892 (1.6%) died of any cause. The crude mortality rate was 9773.0 (95% CI 9152.3-10,435.9) per 100,000 person-years. The ASMR was 2567.5 per 100,000 person-years, compared to 1361.1 (1353.6-1368.7) in the general population (see table). The ASMR in March-April 2020 was 1.4 times higher than the mean ASMR for March-April 2015-2019 (1965.6). The increase in deaths during March-April 2020 occurred at a younger age than in the general population. We went on to investige the effect of previous influenza seasons. The 2014/15 season saw the greatest excess all-cause mortality nationally in recent years, and there were 624 deaths in 38,888 people (6472.5 person-years) with vasculitis in our data (crude mortality rate 9640.8 (8913.3-10427.7); The ASMR was 2657.6, which was marginally higher than the ASMR among people with vasculitis recorded during March-April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion People with vasculitis are at increased risk of death during circulating COVID-19 and influenza epidemics. The ASMR among people with vasculitis was high both during the 2014/15 influenza season and during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. COVID-19 vaccination and annual influenza vaccination for people with vasculitis are both important, regardless of patient age. Disclosure M. Rutter: None. P.C.

In general, we show that well-intended EU-funded stabilisation measures may actually be counterproductive in terms of EU cohesion, suboptimal in terms of stabilisation and regressive in terms of cross-country income distribution.","Lucke, Bernd; Neumann, Bodo R.",IJEPS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8192274/,470

Although work‐life interface is a challenge among expatriates it can also be a work‐life harmony. Here, we present the findings of how expatriates work‐day life changed while performing overseas tasks during the coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) pandemic and analyze how this new status quo may influence future expatriates' expectations regarding their work‐life interface. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with 12 expatriates. Results show that although since the beginning of the quarantine, personal life is interfering in work, causing work‐life conflict, the role of the expatriates' family positively impacted their work‐life balance, and harmony. We suggest some recommendations to human resource managers and conclude that the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on expatriates can be a pathway to work‐life harmony, where work and life are seen as an integrative domain, rather than competing ones.","Mello, Sylvia Freitas; Tomei, Patricia Amelia",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8206922/,470

This exploratory paper begins by outlining four aspects of social integration: forming social networks, developing a sense of belonging, linking social integration to the workplace, and language learning. Working within an intersectionality framework that foregrounds migrants' experiences of discrimination, this paper reveals ways that migrants have experienced increased discrimination and inequality in their social integration since the COVID‐19 pandemic began. Recommendations are made regarding tending to migrants' physical and psychosocial needs, countering discriminatory attitudes with empathy, addressing the digital divide, and using intersectionality to empirically examine migrant experiences.","Barker, Marianne",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8207059/,470

The traditional format of gross laboratory sessions experienced a direct impact and few reports documented curricular delivery changes specific to laboratory format. The purpose of this study was to assess the adaptations incorporated in gross anatomy laboratories by anatomists, during May‐August 2020, in response to Covid‐19. MATERIALS/METHODS: Data were collected through the IRB‐approved Virtual Anatomy During Covid‐19 survey that consisted of 20 questions, including open‐ended prompts asking participants to describe the structure of a “typical” laboratory session during Covid‐19. Responses were solicited from professional anatomy associations during June 2020. Open‐ended responses describing anatomy laboratory teaching methods used during Covid‐19 were coded. Descriptive codes were applied to the data according to published methods to summarize verbatim responses. Responses were tabulated and converted to frequencies and percentages. Chi square test assessed differences among the responses when applicable. Alpha<5%. RESULTS: Descriptions of gross anatomy lab teaching during Covid‐19 were coded into four categories : (1) delivery format, (2) format of laboratory practice, (3) type of anatomy digital resources used, and (4) format of student teaching groups. In the first category, synchronous (46.7%), asynchronous (15.6%), and/or a combination of the two (18.8%) were the most frequent laboratory delivery formats (P<0.001). In the second category, student‐led dissection (17.2%), prosection (10.9%), and/or utilization of commercial and/or in‐house anatomical resources (26.2%) were the most frequent laboratory practices (P<0.001). Within this category, a subcategory was discovered in which physical distancing and personal protective equipment practices were reported (15.6%). Concerning the third category, anatomy digital resources (26.2%) were used for asynchronous laboratory preparation and laboratory sessions. In the final category, student small groups (29.7%) were used in remote sessions where “breakout rooms” permitted students to meet with peers and/or faculty. Large groups (9.4%) were used for faculty to review and present the assigned laboratory topic. CONCLUSION: Anatomists largely taught through a remote, synchronous delivery format that relied on cadaveric specimens and digital anatomy resources, as well as small group learning. SIGNIFICANCE/IMPLICATION: This study shows that anatomists were able to adapt the gross anatomy laboratory sessions to synchronous, virtual mediums; however, the impact of these changes to the learner during this unconventional time remains to be determined.","Dennis, Jennifer; Attardi, Stefanie; Bentley, Danielle; Brown, Kirsten; Farkas, Gary; Goldman, Haviva; Harmon, Derek; Harrell, Kelly; Klein, Barbie; Ramnanan, Christopher; Barremkala, Malli",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239714/,470

In this study, we constructed a perioperative RBCs transfusion predictive model (ternary classifications) based on a machine learning algorithm. Materials and Methods: This study included perioperative adult patients with pelvic trauma hospitalized across six Chinese centers between September 2012 and June 2019. An extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was used to predict the need for perioperative RBCs transfusion, with data being split into training test (80%), which was subjected to 5-fold cross-validation, and test set (20%). The ability of the predictive transfusion model was compared with blood preparation based on surgeons' experience and other predictive models, including random forest, gradient boosting decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and Gaussian naïve Bayes classifier models. Data of 33 patients from one of the hospitals were prospectively collected for model validation. Results: Among 510 patients, 192 (37.65%) have not received any perioperative RBCs transfusion, 127 (24.90%) received less-transfusion (RBCs < 4U), and 191 (37.45%) received more-transfusion (RBCs ≥ 4U). Machine learning-based transfusion predictive model produced the best performance with the accuracy of 83.34%, and Kappa coefficient of 0.7967 compared with other methods (blood preparation based on surgeons' experience with the accuracy of 65.94%, and Kappa coefficient of 0.5704; the random forest method with an accuracy of 82.35%, and Kappa coefficient of 0.7858; the gradient boosting decision tree with an accuracy of 79.41%, and Kappa coefficient of 0.7742; the K-nearest neighbor with an accuracy of 53.92%, and Kappa coefficient of 0.3341). In the prospective dataset, it also had a food performance with accuracy 81.82%. Conclusion: This multicenter retrospective cohort study described the construction of an accurate model that could predict perioperative RBCs transfusion in patients with pelvic fractures.","Huang, Xueyuan; Wang, Yongjun; Chen, Bingyu; Huang, Yuanshuai; Wang, Xinhua; Chen, Linfeng; Gui, Rong; Ma, Xianjun",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8415266/,470

As directed in Ireland's National Action Plan, NAS significantly expanded prehospital services, including provision of a novel home and community COVID-19 testing service. Additionally, other health services rely on NAS's capacity to assess, transport and/or treat COVID-19 patients. In a climate of innovation and adaptation, NAS needs to learn from international ambulance services and share experience. Evaluation of the NAS response to COVID-19 is required to facilitate evidence-based planning for subsequent waves or future pandemics, and to identify innovative practice for mainstreaming into routine service provision. Aims: This project aims to provide information networks and evaluation tools that will help NAS meet these requirements. Methods: The first aim will be to produce ambulance-specific research and information updates for NAS. Secondly, an international network of senior ambulance and research personnel will be established ('AMBULANCE+COVID19' network) and a short-survey instrument, the Emergency Medical Services Five Question Survey (EMS-5QS), will be developed. The EMS-5QS will enable AMBULANCE+COVID19 participants to nominate a topic for which they would like to hear about the experience and practice of other ambulance services. Multiple surveys covering a range of topics will be carried out. Finally, an evaluation framework will be developed to enable NAS determine innovations: (1) for reactivation in another wave or new pandemic; (2) to be sustained as part of routine service. The framework will be developed in collaboration with NAS and the Health Service Executive National Quality Improvement Team. The Research Team includes expertise from academia, ambulance services and the National Public Health Emergency Team. Conclusions: Ability to mobilise resources quickly and utilise ready-made international networks will ensure a successful project than can inform future information sharing methodologies and pandemic planning for ambulance services internationally.","Masterson, Siobhán; Heffernan, Eithne; Keegan, Dylan; Clarke, Bridget; Deasy, Conor; O'Donnell, Cathal; Crowley, Philip; Breen, Roisin; Kelly, Maureen E; Murphy, Andrew W",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13149.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33537553/,470

RECENT FINDINGS SAP-E sets targets for the implementation of evidence-based preventive actions and stroke services to 2030. A recent mapping of stroke care in Europe has documented massive inequalities and even in high-income European countries access to reperfusion therapy and mortality after ischaemic stroke varies significantly. Organized stroke care providing stroke unit care and access to reperfusion therapies reduces mortality and long-term disability. Stroke prevention and care are highly cost-effective. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged organized care, diverged attention from stroke and necessitated a novel approach to the implementation program because of the continued need for social distancing and reduced travelling. Consequently, meetings, training and engagement will be handled by online resources. SUMMARY Stroke can be prevented and treated but there remain massive inequalities in Europe. SAP-E has set targets for development of stroke care. COVID-19 pandemic has led to further challenges for stroke care and implementation of the Action Plan will rely on online meetings and resources as it is yet unforeseeable when things will return to normal.

Even if the extent of initial surgery is deemed adequate, the recurrence rate remains high, up to 50% in most series. Measurement of serum calcitonin is important in the follow-up of patients with MTC, and reliably reflects the existence of the disease. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION There is no single sensitive diagnostic imaging method to reveal all MTC recurrences or metastases. Conventional morphologic imaging methods (U/S, CT, and MRI) and several methods of nuclear medicine have been used for this purpose with variable accuracy. RESULTS The main role of nuclear medicine imaging is the detection of residual or recurrent tumor in the postoperative follow-up. In this review we present the radiopharmaceuticals used in the diagnosis of MTC recurrence, and comparison among them. CONCLUSIONS The most used radiopharmaceuticals labelled with γ emitters are: Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), labelled with (131)I or (123)I, (111)In-pentetreotide (Octreoscan), 99mTc-pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc(V)-DMSA), and (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-Tyr3-Octreotide ( Tektrotyd). The radiopharmaceuticals labelled with a positron-emitting radionuclide (β+), suitable for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging are: (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG), (18)F-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA), and 68Ga-labelled somatostatin analogues (68Ga-DOTATATE or DOTATOC).","Skoura, Evangelia",International journal of endocrinology and metabolism,https://doi.org/10.5812/ijem.8156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719630/,470

However, for a given fat mass, there is a large variability in the risk prediction of these cardiometabolic diseases. For example, some lean people unexpectedly have a risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease that is similar to the increased risk that is observed in most people who have obesity. What both of these phenotypes have in common is a very characteristic fat distribution. As a result, much focus has been given on the strong predictive power of increased visceral fat mass. However, an analysis of the causes of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, as well as comparisons to rare diseases such as lipodystrophy and studying genetically determined fat distribution in the general population, suggest that an impaired ability to expand subcutaneous fat in the lower part of the body is also important for predicting the incidence of these cardiometabolic diseases. This Review, first, addresses the identification of distinct fat distribution phenotypes and their risk of cardiometabolic diseases by discussing findings from published studies that have applied precise quantification of different fat depots. Second, this Review provides support for the theory that a lower amount of lower-body fat mass is equally important to a high amount of visceral fat mass as a determinant of cardiometabolic diseases. Third, this Review discusses the genetic and lifestyle-related causes of metabolically healthy and unhealthy fat distribution. Finally, this Review summarises and appraises the effectiveness of lifestyle-related interventions and pharmacological interventions for reducing visceral adiposity and maintaining lower-body fat mass to prevent and treat cardiometabolic diseases.","Stefan, Norbert",The lancet.

This acquired immunity was originally attributed to long-lived, memory T and B cells with body wide access to peripheral and secondary lymphoid tissues. In recent years, it has been realized that both innate and adaptive immunity to a large degree depends on resident immune cells that act locally in barrier tissues, including tissue resident memory T cells (Trm). Here, we will discuss the phenotype of these Trm in mice and humans, the tissues and niches that support them, and their function, plasticity and transcriptional control. Their unique properties enable Trm to achieve long-lived immunological memory that can be deposited in nearly every organ in response to acute and persistent infection, and in response to cancer. However, Trm may also induce substantial immunopathology in allergic and autoimmune disease if their actions remain unchecked. Therefore, inhibitory and activating stimuli appear to balance the actions of Trm to ensure rapid pro-inflammatory responses upon infection and to prevent damage to host tissues under steady state conditions.

Acknowledging the impacts of movement of unidentified patients and the limited testing capacity on understanding the spread of the virus, an augmented Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Confirmed-Recovered (SEICR) model integrating intercity migration data and testing capacity is developed to probe into the number of unidentified COVID-19 infected patients. This model allows evaluation of the effectiveness of active interventions, and more accurate prediction of the pandemic progression in a country, region or city. A pseudo-coevolutionary algorithm is adopted in the model fitting to provide an effective estimation of high-dimensional unknown parameter sets using a limited amount of historical data. The model is applied to 175 regions in Australia, Canada, Italy, Japan, Spain, the UK and USA to estimate the number of unconfirmed cases using limited historical data. Results showed that the actual number of infected cases could be 4.309 times as many as the official confirmed number. By implementing mass COVID-19 testing, the number of infected cases could be reduced by about 50\%.

Some of these adaptations - in particular, the transition of patient care to virtual visits are revolutionary. Increased vigilance by health care organization and workers to minimize the spread of infection to others as well for personal protection may result in lasting behavioral change that will prevent hospital acquired or transmitted infections and may lead to reduced morbidity and mortality from the regular ""flu"".

Rice seedlings were exposed to g-C3N4 and Cd for 20 days. Our results suggest that 200 mg/L g-C3N4 significantly increased the fresh weight and root and shoot length as compared with the control, and notably alleviated Cd-induced toxicity. The addition of 200 mg/L g-C3N4 significantly reduced the root and shoot Cd content by approximately 14% and 23%, respectively. In addition, 200 mg/L g-C3N4 significantly elevated the nitrogen content and decreased C/N ration in rice shoots; most importantly, it alleviated Cd-induced nitrogen reduction. Our findings demonstrated the potential of g-C3N4 in regulating plant growth and minimizing the Cd-induced phytotoxicity, and shed light on providing a new strategy to maintain heavy metal contamination in agriculture using a low-cost and environmental friendly NMs.","Hao, Yi; Lv, Ruitao; Ma, Chuanxin; Adeel, Muhammad; Zhao, Ziqian; Rao, Yuhang; Rui, Yukui",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12027-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411295/,470

Skeletonization, a technique that uses an ultrasonic scalpel, is increasingly used. However, the cost of an ultrasonic scalpel is extremely high. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a new electrosurgical cautery device (ForceTriad™) is as effective as an ultrasonic scalpel. METHODS Bilateral ITAs were harvested from eight pigs using the skeletonizing technique. The ITA on one side was harvested with an ultrasonic scalpel and on the other side using the ForceTriad™. Macroscopic and histological examinations were performed in sixteen ITAs. RESULTS No significant differences in the time required for harvesting were observed. The macroscopic findings revealed no significant change in any of the samples. The histological findings showed that the degree of thermal injury was similar. The normal structure was maintained in all samples. The ForceTriad™ costs US$ 226.82 less per patient than the ultrasonic scalpel. CONCLUSION The new electrosurgical cautery device ForceTriad™ was less expensive, but it was equally effective. It appears that skeletonization performed with the new device is equivalent to that performed with an ultrasonic scalpel.","Ito, N; Tashiro, T; Sakata, N; Morishige, N; Nishimi, M; Takeuchi, K; Hayashida, Y; Minematsu, N; Kuwahara, G; Sukehiro, Y; Teratani, H; Fukagawa, H",The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-1271118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21692022/,470

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of robotic surgery for the management of DIE. METHODS A 5-year retrospective cohort study was made of robotic procedures including: segmental bowel resections, removal of nodules from the rectovaginal septum (RVS) with or without rectal shaving and partial bladder resection. RESULTS Overall, 19 bowel resections, 23 removals of RVS nodules and five bladder resections were performed, alone or in combination. Associated posterior vaginal resections were performed in 12 cases. Neither intra-operative complications, nor conversion to laparotomy occurred. One anastomotic leakage was recorded. CONCLUSION This series of robotic procedures for DIE represents the largest currently available and it helps to promote robotics as a safe and attractive alternative to accomplish a comprehensive surgical treatment of DIE, especially when bowel or bladder resections are needed.","Siesto, Gabriele; Ieda, Nicoletta; Rosati, Riccardo; Vitobello, Domenico",The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS,https://doi.org/10.1002/rcs.1518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23766030/,470

During recent years, important advances in the molecular biology concerning the life cycle of these viruses have allowed the manipulation and generation of recombinant viruses and replicons with multiple applications, mainly in viral biology and the screening of antiviral compounds. In the present study, we describe the construction of an enhanced green fluorescent protein-bearing DENV replicon under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. Following a rational in silico design and cloning by standard molecular biology techniques, a reporter DENV-2 replicon and a replication-deficient mutant were constructed, and characterized by confocal microscopy and real-time RT-PCR. The results showed successful transcription, translation, and autonomous viral RNA replication of the DENV replicon from its DNA clone. This novel DENV replicon will allow the study of viral replication and testing of antiviral candidates without the need for in vitro transcription.","Usme-Ciro, Jose A; Lopera, Jaime A; Alvarez, Diego A; Enjuanes, Luis; Almazán, Fernando",Intervirology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000476066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28641298/,470

As such, new strategies for drug discovery are needed. Drug repurposing represents an opportunity to rapidly advance new therapeutic strategies into clinical trials at a relatively low cost. Known on-patent or off-patent drugs with unrecognized anticancer activity can be rapidly advanced into clinical testing for this new indication by leveraging their known pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology. Using this approach, academic groups can participate in the drug discovery field and smaller biotechnology companies can ""de-risk"" early-stage drug discovery projects. Here, several scientific approaches used to identify drug repurposing opportunities are highlighted, with a focus on hematologic malignancies. In addition, a discussion of the regulatory issues that are unique to drug repurposing and how they impact developing old drugs for new indications is included. Finally, the mechanisms to enhance drug repurposing through increased collaborations between academia, industry, and nonprofit charitable organizations are discussed.","Sukhai, Mahadeo A; Spagnuolo, Paul A; Weir, Scott; Kasper, James; Patton, Lavonne; Schimmer, Aaron D",Blood,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2011-02-315283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21511957/,470
68371,WPA Secretariat's work during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND During the past 20 years, laparoscopy has revolutionized colorectal surgery. With proven benefits in patient outcomes and healthcare utilization, laparoscopic colorectal surgery has steadily increased in use. Robotic surgery, a new addition to colorectal surgery, has been suggested to facilitate and overcome limitations of laparoscopic surgery. Our objective was to compare the outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic resection (RALR) to laparoscopic resections (LAP) in colorectal surgery. METHODS A national inpatient database was evaluated for colorectal resections performed over a 30-month period. Cases were divided into traditional LAP and RALR resection groups. Cost of robot acquisition and servicing were not measured. Main outcome measures were hospital length of stay (LOS), operative time, complications, and costs between groups. RESULTS A total of 17,265 LAP and 744 RARL procedures were identified. The RALR cases had significantly higher total cost ($5,272 increase, p < 0.001) and direct cost ($4,432 increase, p < 0.001), significantly longer operating time (39 min, p < 0.001), and were more likely to develop postoperative bleeding (odds ratio 1.6; p = 0.014) than traditional laparoscopic patients. LOS, complications, and discharge disposition were comparable. Similar findings were noted for both laparoscopic colonic and rectal surgery. CONCLUSIONS RALR had significantly higher costs and operative time than traditional LAP without a measurable benefit.","Keller, Deborah S; Senagore, Anthony J; Lawrence, Justin K; Champagne, Brad J; Delaney, Conor P",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3163-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23996335/,470

Hot electrons in bulk semiconductors usually relax via electron-phonon scattering on a sub-picosecond timescale. Quantum-confined semiconductors such as quantum dots offer a unique platform to prolong hot electron lifetime through their size-tunable electronic structures. Here, we study hot electron relaxation in electron-doped (n-doped) colloidal CdSe quantum dots. For lightly-doped dots we observe a slow 1Pe hot electron relaxation (~10 picosecond) resulting from a Pauli spin blockade of the preoccupying 1Se electron. For heavily-doped dots, a large number of electrons residing in the surface states introduce picosecond Auger recombination which annihilates the valance band hole, allowing us to observe 300-picosecond-long hot electrons as a manifestation of a phonon bottleneck effect. This brings the hot electron energy loss rate to a level of sub-meV per picosecond from a usual level of 1 eV per picosecond. These results offer exciting opportunities of hot electron harvesting by exploiting carrier-carrier, carrier-phonon and spin-spin interactions in doped quantum dots.","Wang, Junhui; Wang, Lifeng; Yu, Shuwen; Ding, Tao; Xiang, Dongmei; Wu, Kaifeng",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20835-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33483503/,470

Very short answer questions (VSAQs) are a reliable and discriminatory alternative that encourage learners to use more authentic clinical reasoning strategies compared to SBAQs. However, the challenge of marking VSAQs has limited their integration into TBL; we therefore explored the feasibility of VSAQs within a TBL session. METHODS An online platform was developed to allow immediate marking of VSAQs during the TBL sessions. As part of the readiness assurance process, students completed VSAQs and SBAQs, which were marked in real time. RESULTS Instructors were able to mark all VSAQs during the individual readiness assurance test (iRAT), which facilitated the provision of immediate feedback during the team readiness assurance test (tRAT). The mean time to mark five VSAQs was 422 seconds (SD 73 seconds). For VSAQs, the number of attempts to reach the correct answer ranged from 1 to 38, compared to 1 to 4 for SBAQs. In total, 71.6% of students agreed that using VSAQs in TBL helped to emphasise group discussions. DISCUSSION The wide range of attempts at, and students' perspectives of VSAQs are suggestive of their positive impact on student discussion during TBL. We demonstrate how new technology allows VSAQs to be feasibly integrated into TBL with the potential to enrich group discussions.","Millar, Kate R; Reid, Michael D; Rajalingam, Preman; Canning, Claire A; Halse, Omid; Low-Beer, Naomi; Sam, Amir H",The clinical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1111/tct.13347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763986/,470
69564,Exergames as Coping Strategies for Anxiety Disorders During the COVID-19 Quarantine Period.,2020-05-04,"OBJECTIVES Coronavirus disease 2019 has emerged as a major global health threat with a great number of deaths in China. We aimed to assess the association between Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, and to compare the predictive ability of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, Age 65 (CURB65) score. DESIGN Retrospective observational cohort. SETTING Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. SUBJECTS Confirmed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized in the ICU of Tongji hospital from January 10, 2020, to February 10, 2020. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 178 potentially eligible patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, 23 patients (12.92%) were diagnosed as suspected cases, and one patient (0.56%) suffered from cardiac arrest immediately after admission. Ultimately, 154 patients were enrolled in the analysis and 52 patients (33.77%) died. Mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (23.23 ± 6.05) was much higher in deaths compared with the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 10.87 ± 4.40 in survivors (p < 0.001). Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was independently associated with hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.13). In predicting hospital mortality, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score demonstrated better discriminative ability (area under the curve, 0.966; 95% CI, 0.942-0.990) than Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (area under the curve, 0.867; 95% CI, 0.808-0.926) and CURB65 score (area under the curve, 0.844; 95% CI, 0.784-0.905). Based on the cut-off value of 17, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score could predict the death of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with a sensitivity of 96.15% and a specificity of 86.27%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the survivor probability of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score less than 17 was notably higher than that of patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was an effective clinical tool to predict hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and CURB65 score. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 serves as an early warning indicator of death and may provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.","Zou, Xiaojing; Li, Shusheng; Fang, Minghao; Hu, Ming; Bian, Yi; Ling, Jianmin; Yu, Shanshan; Jing, Liang; Li, Donghui; Huang, Jiao",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32697506/,470

In sum, 34 HIV-infected patients without meningitis, 44 HCM patients and 27 HTBM patients were enrolled for study. The concentrations of 22 cytokines/chemokines in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were assayed in at admission. Principal component analysis (PCA), Pearson and logistic regression analyses were used to assess the role of cytokines/chemokines in HCM and HTBM. We found the levels of Th17, Th1 (IL-12p40, IFN-γ, TNFα and TNF-β) and Th2 (IL-2/4/5/6/10) cytokines were elevated in patients with meningitis compared with those in HIV-infected patients without CNS infection. Furthermore, the IL-1Ra, IL-12p40, IL-17α and MCP-1 levels were higher in HCM patients, while the IFN-γ, RANTES and IP-10 levels were higher in HTBM patients. Elevated CSF concentrations of IL-17a, TNF-β, IL-5, IL-12p40 and IL-1Rα were closely related to meningitis, but elevated IP-10, MCP-1, RANTES, and IFN-γ levels and CSF WBCs were protective factors against HCM. Our study suggested HIV-infected patients with low CSF WBCs have a high risk of HCM. Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines/chemokines mediate differences in the pathogenesis of HCM and TBM. Overexpressed proinflammatory MCP-1, RANTES, IFN-γ and IP-10 in CSF are protective factors against HCM but not HTBM.","Xu, Lijun; Xu, Yufan; Zheng, Yanghao; Peng, Xiuming; Yang, Zongxing; Cao, Qing; Xiang, Dairong; Zhao, Handan",Clinical and experimental immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.13644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287847/,470
70758,Experiences with implementation of continuous positive airway pressure for neonates and infants in low-resource settings: A scoping review.,2021,"Influenza C virus (ICV) has only one kind of spike protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein. HE functions similarly to hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase of the influenza A and B viruses (IAV/IBV). It has a monobasic site, which is cleaved by some host enzyme(s). The cleavage is essential to activating the virus, but the enzyme(s) in the respiratory tract has not been identified. This study investigated whether the host serine proteases, transmembrane protease serine S1, members 2 (TMPRSS2), and human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), which reportedly cleave HA of IAV/IBV, are involved in HE cleavage. We established TMPRSS2- and HAT-expressing MDCK (MDCK-TMPRSS2, MDCK-HAT) cells. ICV showed multicycle replication with HE cleavage without trypsin in MDCK-TMPRSS2 cells as well as IAV did. The HE cleavage and multicycle replication did not appear in MDCK-HAT cells infected with ICV without trypsin, while HA cleavage and multi-step growth of IAV appeared in the cells. Amino acid sequences of the HE cleavage site in 352 ICV strains were completely preserved. Camostat and nafamostat suppressed the growth of ICV and IAV in human nasal surface epithelial (HNE) cells. Therefore, this study revealed that, at least, TMPRSS2 is involved in HE cleavage and suggested that nafamostat could be a candidate for therapeutic drugs of ICV infection. Importance Influenza C virus (ICV) is a pathogen that causes acute respiratory illness, mostly in children, but there are no anti-ICV drugs. ICV has only one kind of spike protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein on the virion surface, that possesses receptor binding, receptor destroying, and membrane fusion activities. The HE cleavage is essential for the virus to be activated, but the enzyme(s) in the respiratory tract has not been identified. This study revealed that transmembrane protease serine S1, members 2 (TMPRSS2), and not human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), is involved in HE cleavage. This is a novel study on the host enzymes involved in HE cleavage, and the result suggests that the host enzymes, such as TMPRSS2, may be a target for therapeutic drugs of the ICV infection.","Sato, Ko; Hayashi, Hideki; Shimotai, Yoshitaka; Yamaya, Mutsuo; Hongo, Seiji; Kawakami, Kazuyoshi; Matsuzaki, Yoko; Nishimura, Hidekazu",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01296-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34406864/,470

Denoising using deep learning reconstruction (Advanced Intelligent Clear-IQ Engine [AiCE]) has been reported for CT and MR. The purpose of this study was to compare the contrast-to-noise ratio of endolymph to perilymph (CNREP) between the improved hybrid of reversed image of the positive endolymph signal and the native image of the perilymph signal multiplied with the heavily T2-weighted MR cisternography (iHYDROPS-Mi2) images, which used AiCE for the three source images (i.e. positive endolymph image [PEI], positive perilymph image [PPI], MR cisternography [MRC]) to those that did not use AiCE. We also examined if there was a difference between iHYDROPS-Mi2 images with and without AiCE for degree of visual grading of EH and in endolymphatic area [EL] ratios. METHODS Nine patients with suspicion of EH were imaged on a 3T MR scanner. iHYDROPS images were generated by subtraction of PEI images from PPI images. iHYDROPS-Mi2 images were then generated by multiplying MRC with iHYDROPS images. The CNREP and EL ratio were measured on the iHYDROPS-Mi2 images. Degree of radiologist visual grading for EH was evaluated. RESULTS Mean CNREP ± standard deviation was 1681.8 ± 845.2 without AiCE and 7738.6 ± 5149.2 with AiCE (P = 0.00002). There was no significant difference in EL ratio for images with and without AiCE. Radiologist grading for EH agreed completely between the 2 image types in both the cochlea and vestibule. CONCLUSION The CNREP of iHYDROPS-Mi2 images with AiCE had more than a fourfold increase compared with that without AiCE. Use of AiCE did not adversely affect radiologist grading of EH.","Naganawa, Shinji; Nakamichi, Rei; Ichikawa, Kazushige; Kawamura, Mariko; Kawai, Hisashi; Yoshida, Tadao; Sone, Michihiko",Magnetic resonance in medical sciences : MRMS : an official journal of Japan Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine,https://doi.org/10.2463/mrms.mp.2020-0082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830173/,470

The current case illustrates that the cost of inaction can be higher in the future. The perspective article proposes a dedicated, government-sponsored agency developing anti-viral leads against all potentially dangerous pathogen species.

The agency will employ artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to cut the costs further. The algorithms are expected to receive continuous feedback from the network of partners conducting the tests. EXPERT OPINION The author proposes a bionic principle, emulating antibody response by producing a combinatorial diversity of high q uality generic antiviral leads, suitable for multiple potentially emerging species.

The aim of the current study was to examine whether bronchial suction could also facilitate lung collapse when using a double-lumen tube (DLT). Methods Eighty patients scheduled for elective video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer using a DLT for one-lung ventilation (OLV) were randomised into an arm that received bronchial suction and an arm that underwent spontaneous collapse (n=40 per arm). For bronchial suction, a pressure of -30 cmH2O was applied to the lumen of the non-ventilated lung during the first minute of OLV. The primary endpoint was the degree of lung collapse at 10 min after the start of OLV, assessed on a 10-point visual analogue scale (0: fully inflated; 10: complete collapse). Secondary outcomes included lung collapse at 1 and 5 min after the start of OLV, as well as occurrence of intraoperative hypoxemia. Results Median (interquartile range) lung collapse scores at 10 min were statistically greater in the bronchial suction arm than in the spontaneous collapse arm [9.0 (9.0-9.0) vs. 8.5 (8.0-9.0); P=0.004]. Lung collapse was also statistically greater in the bronchial suction arm at 5 min [8.0 (7.0-8.0) vs. 7.0 (6.25-7.0) min; P=0.002] and 1 min [4.0 (4.0-5.0) vs. 2.0 (2.0-2.0) min; P<0.001]. None of the patients experienced intraoperative hypoxemia and operative complications. Conclusions Bronchial suction resulted in statistically greater but not clinically meaningful lung collapse when using a DLT. However, greater degree of lung collapse at 1-min could be helpful in reducing accidental injuries.","Quan, Xiang; Yi, Jie; Huang, Yuguang; Zhang, Xiuhua; Shen, Le; Li, Shanqing",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2017.11.63; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29312732/,470

Taking advantage of the fact that oceanic islands host fewer species than the mainland, we tested whether island birds show an increase in frequency bandwidth of acoustic signals compared to mainland birds. Given the higher animal diversity and more saturated acoustic space in the tropics, we expected acoustic character release, if any, to be stronger in the tropics than in the temperate zone. We field recorded 22 bird species (11 pairs consisting of an endemic island species and its closest mainland relative) breeding at similar latitudes and in similar habitats: 6 tropical pairs (São Tomé Island / Mount Cameroon), and 5 temperate pairs (Madeira Island / southern France). For each species, we measured the degree of acoustic interference experienced when vocalizing, and the spectral characteristics of its song (minimum and maximum frequencies, bandwidth). As expected, island species spent more time vocalizing alone, and any overlap in vocalizations involved fewer species. The vocalizations of island species spanned broader frequency bandwidths than their mainland counterparts in the tropics (true for all 6 pairs), but this pattern was less evident in the temperate region (2/5 pairs with no marked differences and 1/5 with opposite pattern). Overall, the character release of communication signals only occurred where the differential in number of species was large (tropics). We discuss latitude differences and the potential factors driving the observed differences.","Robert, Aloïs; Melo, Martim; Lengagne, Thierry; Julien, Sacha; Gomez, Doris; Doutrelant, Claire",Journal of evolutionary biology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.13928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34510616/,470

To address this, the need for professional training opportunities for Pharmacy Assistants (PAs) and Pharmacy Dispensary Technicians (PTDs) had been emphasised. A research project was undertaken to develop training modules using Social Determinants of Health (SDH) for PAs and PDTs involved in providing MATOD pharmacy services in regional Victoria, and to evaluate their effectiveness. OBJECTIVES The study aimed to examine and evaluate changes in attitudes and practices amongst PAs and PDTs involved in MATOD services in regional Victoria, Australia and who had undertaken the training modules. METHODS The paper reports primarily on the in-depth qualitative interviews that were completed after the training with PAs and PTDs. Thematic analysis was employed to code the data. RESULTS Thematic analysis generated five themes: understanding of the professional role of PAs and PTDs, initial judgements concerning MATOD consumers, reflection on the SDH, training content analysis, and the post-training impact upon Professional Practice. These themes reflected participants' insights with regards both to MATOD consumers and the impact the training itself had had on their professional practice. CONCLUSION ""Consciousness-raising"" from participation in the training can positively influence the development of participants' professional attitudes and practices with regards to MATOD service delivery. This development supports that training informed by SDH and ideas of critical reflection can help facilitate the creation of knowledge around the social construction of health and increased understanding of the impacts of language-use, attitudes and behaviour.","Patil, Tejaswini; Mummery, Jane; Salman, Mohammed; Cooper, Simon; Williams, Dominic",Research in social & administrative pharmacy : RSAP,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.09.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004304/,470
75971,Getting ready for the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020,"BACKGROUND RPD (Robotic pancreatoduodenectomy) was first performed by P. C. Giulianotti in 2001 (Arch Surg 138(7):777-784, 2003). Since then, the complexity and lack of technique standardization has slowed down its widespread utilization. RPD has been increasingly adopted worldwide and in few centres is the preferred apporached approach by certain surgeons. Some large retrospective series are available and data seem to indicate that RPD is safe/feasible, and a valid alternative to the classic open Whipple. Our group has recently described a standardized 17 steps approach to RPD (Giulianotti et al. Surg Endosc 32(10): 4329-4336, 2018). Herin, we present an educational step-by-step surgical video with short technical/operative description to visually exemplify the RPD 17 steps technique. METHODS The current project has been approved by our local Institutional Review Board (IRB). We edited a step-by-step video guidance of our RPD standardized technique. The data/video images were collected from a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database (IRB approved). The narration and the images describe hands-on operative ""tips and tricks"" to facilitate the learning/teaching/evaluation process. RESULTS Each of the 17 surgical steps is visually represented and explained to help the in-depth understanding of the relevant surgical anatomy and the specific operative technique. CONCLUSIONS Educational videos descriptions like the one herein presented are a valid learning/teaching tool to implement standardized surgical approaches. Standardization is a crucial component of the learning curve. This approach can create more objective and reproducible data which might be more reliably assessed/compared across institutions and by different surgeons. Promising results are arising from several centers about RPD. However, RPD as gold standard-approach is still a matter of debate. Randomized-controlled studies (RCT) are required to better validate the precise role of RPD.","Giulianotti, Pier Cristoforo; Mangano, Alberto; Bustos, Roberto E; Fernandes, Eduardo; Masrur, Mario A; Valle, Valentina; Gangemi, Antonio; Bianco, Francesco M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07383-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31953732/,470

78663,Balancing Health and Economic Factors when Reopening Business in the Age of COVID-19.,2020-07-07,"BACKGROUND Selecting patients for iliofemoral vein stenting has traditionally relied on the identification and quantification of stenotic lesions with imaging such as multiplanar venography. Recently, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging has become more available. However, to date, the usefulness of these imaging modalities using the customary >50% treatment threshold for diameter (multiplanar venography) and area (IVUS) stenosis of iliofemoral veins has not been validated prospectively within the context of clinical improvement. METHODS The multicenter Venogram Versus Intravascular Ultrasound for Diagnosing and Treating Iliofemoral Vein Obstruction (VIDIO) trial prospectively enrolled 100 symptomatic patients (Clinical Etiologic Anatomic Pathophysiologic [CEAP] classification of 4-6) with suspected iliofemoral venous outflow disease. Venous stenting for presumed significant iliofemoral vein stenosis, based on imaging and clinical findings, was performed on 68 patients. Based on imaging, stenosis was characterized as nonthrombotic in 48 patients and post-thrombotic in 20 patients. Each underwent baseline and poststenting venography and IVUS to compare the diagnostic and clinical usefulness of the tests. The revised Venous Clinical Severity Score was used to assess clinical patient outcome. A >4-point reduction in the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score between baseline and 6 months was used as an indicator of clinically meaningful improvement. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the optimal diameter and area thresholds for prediction of clinical improvement. RESULTS Clinical improvement after stenting was best predicted by IVUS baseline measurement of area stenosis (area under the curve, 0.64; P = .04), with >54% estimated as the optimal threshold of stenosis indicating interventional treatment. With measurement of lumen gain from baseline to after the procedure, the optimal reduction in vein stenosis correlative of later clinical improvement was >41%; IVUS measurement of area stenosis was most predictive (area under the curve, 0.70; P = .004). Venographic measurements of baseline stenosis and stenotic change were not predictive of later improvement. In a 48-patient nonthrombotic subset analysis, IVUS diameter rather than area measurements of baseline stenosis were significantly predictive of clinical success, but indicated a higher optimal threshold of stenosis (>61%) may be necessary. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that IVUS shows significant usefulness at predicting when stenting iliofemoral vein stenosis in patients clinical-etiologic-anatomic-pathophysiologic classification of 4-6 will result in significant symptom improvement. Our findings corroborate the conventional >50% cross-sectional area threshold by IVUS as defining a clinically significant iliofemoral stenosis that, when stented, has significant predictive value for symptom improvement. In nonthrombotic patients, however, a threshold of >61% diameter stenosis by IVUS may better predict clinical improvement.","Gagne, Paul J; Gasparis, Antonios; Black, Stephen; Thorpe, Patricia; Passman, Marc; Vedantham, Suresh; Marston, William; Iafrati, Mark",Journal of vascular surgery.

However, the use of navigation systems that incorporate instrument tracking and three-dimensional visualization of preoperative tomography is increasing. This report describes an initial experience using an image-guidance system with navigated US. METHODS An image-guidance system was used in a total of 50 open liver procedures to aid in localization and targeting of liver lesions. An optical tracking system was employed to localize surgical instruments. Customized hardware and calibration of the US transducer were required. The results of three procedures are highlighted in order to illustrate specific navigation techniques that proved useful in the broader patient cohort. RESULTS Over a 7-month span, the navigation system assisted in completing 21 (42%) of the procedures, and tracked US alone provided additional information required to perform resection or ablation in six procedures (12%). Average registration time during the three illustrative procedures was <1 min. Average set-up time was approximately 5 min per procedure. CONCLUSIONS The Explorer™ Liver guidance system represents novel technology that continues to evolve. This initial experience indicates that image guidance is valuable in certain procedures, specifically in cases in which difficult anatomy or tumour location or echogenicity limit the usefulness of traditional guidance methods.","Kingham, T Peter; Scherer, Michael A; Neese, Benjamin W; Clements, Logan W; Stefansic, James D; Jarnagin, William R",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1477-2574.2012.00487.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22882196/,470

METHODS T2D patients registered in SMID were analyzed. Biochemical, clinical and lifestyle variables were recorded. Factors associated to HbA1c ≤7% were explored. Quality of care of the clinic was measured according to the National Committee for Quality Assurance Criteria (NCQA) that requires a score of 75 to achieve a good quality of care. RESULTS 511 patients were included. Prescription of basal insulin, SGLT-2 inhibitors and barriers to follow nutritional plan were associated with decreased probability of having adequate glycemic control. Patients in the maintenance stage of motivation had higher probability of having HbA1c ≤7%. According to NCQA evaluation 60 points were achieved. Glucose goals were not met; 35.9% had HbA1c ≥9% and 17% HbA1c <7%. While foot evaluation, smoking approach, blood pressure and lipids goals were accomplished; eye and renal evaluations were borderline. CONCLUSION Glycemic control in patients with long standing T2D and multiple comorbidities is challenging, which directly impacts in the quality of care.

Although minimally invasive adrenal surgery replaced the open adrenalectomy, SILS adrenalectomy is a step forward technique that improves the cosmesis, decreases acsess related morbidity, and increases the postoperative recovery. We report our first experience with single-incision transperitoneal left adrenalectomy in a patient with Conns' syndrome. CASE A 46-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of Conns' syndrome underwent single-incision transperitoneal laparoscopic left adrenalectomy. SILS port (Covidien, Norwalk, CT) was used through a 2-cm incision and additional one 5-mm trocar used through one of the holes of SILS port to solve the smoke problem. The operative time was ended in 50 minutes, and no peroperative complication was encountered. The patient was discharged at the second postoperative day. CONCLUSION SILS adrenalectomy is a safe procedure for a benign adrenal lesion in experienced hands.

METHODS Using a quality improvement design, our research team created an online survey for evaluating program materials by healthcare providers (i.e., neurologists, nurses, physical therapists, and occupational therapists). Participants provided written comments and suggestions for improvement regarding roles and responsibilities and clarity and relatability of these tools within a real-world setting. RESULTS Healthcare providers submitted 13 suggestions for improvement. Responses informed four specific improvements regarding program materials (i.e., patient screening, current exercise behavior, referrals, and provider checklists), thereby prompting the research team to adapt and further test the change idea.

82201,The Importance of Proper Death Certification During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-06-10,"AIM Improved survival after cardiac arrest has placed greater emphasis on neurologic resuscitation. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the relationship between cerebrovascular autoregulation and neurologic outcomes after pediatric cardiac arrest. METHODS Children resuscitated from cardiac arrest had autoregulation monitoring during the first 72h after return of circulation with an index derived from near-infrared spectroscopy in a pilot study. The range of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) with optimal vasoreactivity (MAPOPT) was identified. The area under the curve (AUC) of the time spent with MAP below MAPOPT and MAP deviation below MAPOPT was calculated. Neurologic outcome measures included placement of a new tracheostomy or gastrostomy, death from a primary neurologic etiology (brain death or withdrawal of support for neurologic futility), and change in the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score (ΔPCPC). RESULTS Thirty-six children were monitored. Among children who did not require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), children who received a tracheostomy/gastrostomy had greater AUC during the second 24h after resuscitation than those who did not (P=0.04; n=19). Children without ECMO who died from a neurologic etiology had greater AUC during the first 48h than did those who lived or died from cardiovascular failure (P=0.04; n=19). AUC below MAPOPT was not associated with ΔPCPC when children with or without ECMO were analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS Deviation from the blood pressure with optimal autoregulatory vasoreactivity may predict poor neurologic outcomes after pediatric cardiac arrest.

Specifically, we assessed which dark traits are associated with human values and whether the dark traits explained variance in values beyond the bright traits (Big Five). While prior research has investigated the relations between the three sets of constructs mainly in Western countries, we tested whether the findings hold in Brazil (N = 819). Although values are defined as positive constructs, several value subfunctions were positively correlated with the dark traits (e.g., excitement values with narcissism), while other relations were negative. Controlling for participants' age and gender, hierarchical regressions further revealed that dark traits explain variance in values beyond bright traits, although overall bright traits were more strongly associated with values than dark traits.

The complexes were studied in solution as paramagnetic CEST (paraCEST) agents and after loading into Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells as cell-based CEST (cellCEST) agents. The fluorophores attached to the complexes through an amide linkage imparted an unusual pH dependence to the paraCEST properties of all four complexes through of ionization of a group that was attributed to the amide NH linker. The furthest shifted CEST peak for the hydroxypropyl-based complexes changed by ∼90 ppm upon increasing the pH from 5 to 7.5. At acidic pH, the Co(II) complexes exhibited three to four CEST peaks with the most highly shifted CEST peak at 200 ppm. The complexes demonstrated substantial paramagnetic water proton shifts which is a requirement for the development of cellCEST agents. The large shift in the proton resonance was attributed to an inner-sphere water at neutral pH, as shown by variable temperature 17O NMR spectroscopy studies. Labeling of yeast with one of these paraCEST agents was optimized with fluorescence microscopy and validated by using ICP mass spectrometry quantitation of cobalt. A weak asymmetry in the Z-spectra was observed in the yeast labeled with a Co(II) complex, toward a cellCEST effect, although the Co(II) complexes were toxic to the cells at the concentrations necessary for observation of cellCEST.","Patel, Akanksha; Abozeid, Samira M; Cullen, Paul J; Morrow, Janet R",Inorganic chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c02470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33138368/,470

Microbial production of D-PA from natural renewable resources is attractive and challenging. In this study, both strain improvements and fermentation process strategies were applied to achieve high-level D-PA production in Escherichia coli. First, a D-PA-producing strain was developed through deletion of the aceF and mdh genes combined with the overexpression of the gene ppnk. The obtained engineered E. coli DPA02/pT-ppnk accumulated 6.89 ± 0.11 g/L of D-PA in shake flask fermentation, which was 79.9% higher than the control strain. Moreover, the cultivation process contributed greatly to D-PA production with respect to titer and productivity by betaine supplementation and dissolved oxygen (DO)-feedback feeding framework. Under optimal conditions, 68.3 g/L of D-PA, the specific productivity of 0.794 g/L·h and the yield of 0.36 g/g glucose in 5 L fermenter were achieved.

84954,Response to and Recovery from the COVID-19 Pandemic: What Will It Take?,2020-04-27,"The burden of Alzheimer disease (AD) on the US healthcare system is substantial and increasing. AD progresses along a continuum from preclinical disease characterized by normal cognition and abnormal brain biomarkers to mild cognitive impairment and then clinically apparent dementia. Diagnosis early in the AD continuum has benefits for patients and caregivers and appears cost-effective, but often, the clinical diagnosis of AD may be delayed. Currently available biomarkers include β-amyloid positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid tests. Collectively, they are expensive, may lead to adverse effects, are not widely available, and are not suited for primary care. Currently available treatment options, cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, do not alter disease progression, but can help with some symptoms. Benefits of currently available treatments on cognition are difficult to quantify and are offset by a burden of adverse effects that often go unrecognized. More accurate diagnostic biomarkers and disease-modifying drug therapies are critical unmet needs of patients with AD despite decades of clinical research. Because many phase 3 clinical trials that enrolled patients with symptomatic AD have failed, researchers believe that disease-modifying treatment is more likely to demonstrate benefit when utilized early in the disease continuum. Within the past few years, significant achievements that will advance clinical trials in early AD include the Research Framework to define and stage the AD continuum, FDA guidance on study design in early AD, and development of scales to measure cognition that are suitable for early AD. In October 2019, the AD community was re-invigorated by unexpected news that a Biologics License Application will be submitted for aducanumab to treat AD.

However, targeted synthesis of zeolites with new pore structures and compositions remains a key challenge. Here, we propose an approach based on a unique 3D-3D topotactic transformation, which takes advantage of weak bonding in zeolites. This is inspired by the structure transformation of PST-5, a new aluminophosphate molecular sieve, to PST-6 by calcination. The structure of nano-sized PST-5 crystals is determined by 3D electron diffraction. We find that the 3D-3D topotactic transformation involves two types of building units where penta- or hexa-coordinated Al is present. We apply this approach to several other zeolite systems and predict a series of new zeolite structures that would be synthetically feasible. This method provides a concept for the synthesis of targeted zeolites, especially those which may not be feasible by conventional methods.","Huang, Zhehao; Seo, Seungwan; Shin, Jiho; Wang, Bin; Bell, Robert G; Hong, Suk Bong; Zou, Xiaodong",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17586-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724071/,470

The Ross procedure is a durable, anticoagulation-sparing alternative. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the valve hemodynamics of the Ross procedure versus other AVR. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to February 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (n≥10 Ross). Independently and in duplicate, we performed title and abstract screening, full-text eligibility assessment, and data collection. We evaluated the risk of bias with the Cochrane and CLARITY tools, and the quality of evidence with the GRADE framework. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS We identified 2 RCTs and 13 observational studies that met eligibility criteria (N.=1412). In observational studies, the Ross procedure was associated with a lower mean aortic gradient at discharge (MD -9 mmHg, 95% CI: -13 to -5, P<0.0001, I2=97%) and latest follow-up (MD -5 mmHg, 95% CI: -7 to -3, P<0.0001, I2=92%). There was no significant difference in the incidence of severe aortic regurgitation at latest follow-up (RR 1.3, 95% CI: 0.3 to 5.8, P=0.70, I2=30%). In RCTs, the Ross procedure was associated with a lower mean gradient at latest follow-up (MD -15 mmHg, 95% CI: -32 to 2, P=0.08, I2=99%). The mean pulmonic gradient for the Ross procedure was 18.0 mmHg (95% CI: 16 to 20, P<0.0001) at latest follow-up. The evidence for all outcomes from observational studies was deemed to be of very low quality, while the evidence from RCTs was downgraded for imprecision and moderately serious risk of bias.

85632,REPLY: Factors Other Than Climate Are Likely to Influence Alcohol Consumption.,2020-05-17,"There is currently no vaccine available and no specific medication against Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19). The treatment is mainly based on support measures. In this context, several potentially useful therapies have been approved for use in clinical trials, such as convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT). PubMed was searched for studies on convalescent plasma and COVID-19, SARS or MERS. Studies on clinical efficacy in diseases caused by other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) showed clinical improvement, increase of neutralizing antibodies, decreased mortality and absence of adverse events during and after treatment. We found 13 studies on this type of treatment used in patients with severe and critical COVID-19. Despite limitations regarding methodology, number of patients and the protocols for the analysis of donors' convalescent plasma, patients who received CPT showed clinical improvement, improvement of ventilatory patterns, resolution of lung injuries, decreased mortality, improvement of laboratory parameters, increase of neutralizing antibodies, decreased viral load and low frequency of adverse events.","Galván, César A; Toribio-Dionicio, Crhistian; Álvarez-Ángeles, Marco; Alama-Bazán, Oscar; Sánchez-Ramírez, Luis",Revista peruana de medicina experimental y salud publica,https://doi.org/10.17843/rpmesp.2020.374.5767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33566918/,470

In this study, we created a criterion-based training program on a VR simulator with haptic feedback and tested it by comparing the performances of a simulator group against a control group. MATERIAL AND METHODS Medical students with no experience in laparoscopy were randomly assigned to a simulator group or a control group. In the simulator group, the candidates trained until they reached predefined criteria on the LapSim® VR simulator (Surgical Science AB, Göteborg, Sweden) with haptic feedback (XitactTM IHP, Mentice AB, Göteborg, Sweden). All candidates performed a cholecystectomy on a porcine organ model in a box trainer (the clinical setting). The performances were video rated by two surgeons blinded to subject training status. RESULTS In total, 30 students performed the cholecystectomy and had their videos rated (N = 16 simulator group, N = 14 control group). The control group achieved better video rating scores than the simulator group (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS The criterion-based training program did not transfer skills to the clinical setting. Poor mechanical performance of the simulated haptic feedback is believed to have resulted in a negative training effect.","Våpenstad, Cecilie; Hofstad, Erlend Fagertun; Bø, Lars Eirik; Kuhry, Esther; Johnsen, Gjermund; Mårvik, Ronald; Langø, Thomas; Hernes, Toril Nagelhus",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/13645706.2017.1319866; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28486087/,470
89433,Burnout among Nurses Working in Ethiopia.,2020,"Fungal bioluminescence was recently shown to depend on a unique oxygen-dependent system of several enzymes. However, the identities of the enzymes did not reveal the full biochemical details of this process, as the enzymes do not bear resemblance to those of other luminescence systems, and thus the properties of the enzymes involved in this fascinating process are still unknown. Here, we describe the characteri-zation of the penultimate enzyme in the pathway, hispidin 3-hydroxylase, from the luminescent fungus Mycena chlorophos (McH3H), which catalyzes the con-ver-sion of hispidin to 3-hydroxyhispidin. 3‑Hydroxy-hispidin acts as a luciferin substrate in luminescent fungi. McH3H was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromato-graphy with a yield of 100 mg/l. McH3H was found to be a single component monomeric NAD(P)H-dependent FAD-containing monooxygenase having a preference for NADPH. Through site-directed mutagenesis, based on a modeled structure, mutant enzymes were created that are more efficient with NADH. Except for identifying the residues that tune cofactor specificity, these engineered variants may also help in developing new hispidin-based bioluminescence applications. We confirmed that addition of hispidin to McH3H led to the formation of 3-hydroxy-hispidin as sole aromatic product. Rapid kinetic analysis revealed that reduction of the flavin cofactor by NADPH is boosted by hispidin binding by nearly 100-fold. Similar to other class A flavoprotein hydroxylases, McH3H did not form a stable hydro-peroxyflavin intermediate. These data suggest a mechanism by which the hydroxylase is tuned for converting hispidin into the fungal luciferin.","Tong, Yapei; Trajkovic, Milos; Savino, Simone; van Berkel, Willem J H; Fraaije, Marco W",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.014996; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917724/,470

The present study aims to investigate the effects of 6-week swimming training on blood pressure, oxidative stress variables of selected tissues, serum adrenomedullin (ADM) levels, and in situ muscle contraction in rats with hypertension induced by Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME), an inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide synthases (eNOs). Materials and Methods: Twenty-six male Sprague Dawley, 8 weeks of age, rats were randomly divided into four groups: (I) normotensive (C), (II) normotensive + exercise (E), (III) hypertensive (L), and (IV) hypertensive + exercise (LE). Hypertension was induced by the oral administration of L-NAME (60 mg/kg) for 6 weeks. Exercise was performed 5 times (1-h each) per week for 6 weeks. At the end of the experiment, blood and tissue samples (the gastrocnemius muscle, heart, kidney, and thoracic aorta) were collected following contractile properties of the gastrocnemius muscle in situ weredetermined. In the collected tissues, oxidative stress (e.g., lipid oxidation and antioxidant enzyme activity) and serum ADM levels were measured. 6-week L-NAME administration per se (Group L) led to a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to other groups. Results: Importantly, 6-week exercise caused a protective effect of high blood pressure in the rats received L-NAME (Group LE). The level of ADM was lower in the rats received L-NAME than that of the control group. L-NAME increased lipid peroxidation in the thoracic aorta and decreased superoxide dismutase in the heart, kidney and muscle, and decreased catalase and glutathione in the heart. However, the exercise intervention did not have protective effect on the L-NAME-mediated oxidative damage in the collected tissues. Conclusion: In conclusion, 6-week exercise intervention rescued rats from high blood pressure, but did not have ameliorative effect on the decreased ADM levels.","Koc Yildirim, Ece; Dedeoglu, Zahide; Kaya, Mehmet; Uner, Aykut G",Clinical and experimental hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1080/10641963.2020.1825726; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985250/,470
90605,Initial experiences of US neurologists in practice during the COVID-19 pandemic via survey.,2020-05-21,"PURPOSE The hypothesis that covered stents are superior to bare-metal stents (BMS) in long femoropopliteal artery disease was tested. The one-year results of the VIASTAR trial revealed a patency benefit of covered stents in the treatment-per-protocol (TPP) analysis only. METHODS A prospective, randomized, single-blind, multicenter study evaluated 141 patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) after treatment with heparin-bonded covered stents (VIABAHN(®) Endoprosthesis) or BMS. Clinical outcomes and patency rates were assessed at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months. Mean lesion length was 19.0 ± 6.3 cm in the VIABAHN(®) versus 17.3 ± 6.6 cm in the BMS group. RESULTS The 24-month primary patency rates in the VIABAHN(®) and BMS group were: intention-to-treat 63.1 (95 % CI 0.52-0.76) versus 41.2 % (95 % CI 0.29-0.57; log rank p = 0.04) and TPP 69.4 (95 % CI 0.58-0.83) versus 40.0 % (95 % CI 0.28-0.56; log rank p = 0.004). Freedom from target-lesion-revascularization (TLR) was 79.4 (95 % CI 0.70-0.90) versus 73.0 % (95 % CI 0.63-0.85) for VIABAHN(®) versus BMS (log rank p = 0.37). For the TPP group in lesions ≥20 cm, the 24-month patency rates were 65.2 (95 % CI 0.50-0.85) versus 26.7 % (95 % CI 0.12-0.59; log rank p = 0.004) for VIABAHN(®) versus BMS, and freedom from TLR was 80.0 (95 % CI 0.68-0.94) versus 61.9 % (95 % CI 0.44-0.87; log rank p = 0.13). The ankle brachial index was 0.89 ± 0.18 versus 0.91 ± 0.17 (p = 0.76) at 24-month in the VIABAHN(®) versus the BMS group, respectively. CONCLUSION At 24-month, this trial in PAD patients with long femoropopliteal lesions demonstrated a significantly improved primary patency rate for heparin-bonded covered stents compared to BMS, however, without a significant impact on clinical outcomes and TLR rate (Reg.

This study was performed to determine the temporal relationship between CT attenuation, ADC value, and DWI signal intensity in acute cerebral ischemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS CT and DWI were performed at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 hours after left MCA occlusion in 11 rats. Mean values for CT attenuation, ADC, and DWI signal intensity were determined for the ischemic hemisphere and contralateral normal hemisphere. Temporal changes in each mean value and the relationship between CT attenuation and ADC value and DWI signal intensity were evaluated. RESULTS The decrease of CT attenuation and the increase of DWI signal intensity occurred gradually after MCA occlusion, while ADC value decreased rapidly at 1 hour. Although correlation was significant between time and rCT or rDWI (P<.01, respectively), no correlation between time and rADC was found (P=.33). There was a significant linear correlation between rCT and rDWI (r=0.497, P<.01), but no significant correlation between rCT and rADC (P=.509) was found. CONCLUSIONS The temporal change in CT attenuation was different from that in ADC value with no significant linear correlation between CT attenuation and ADC value for acute cerebral ischemia.

There is limited data on performance of POEM in patients with altered upper gastrointestinal anatomy, especially after bariatric surgery. Outcomes in patients with prior sleeve gastrectomy have not been reported. AIM To assess the efficacy and safety of POEM in patients with prior bariatric surgery. METHODS A prospective POEM database was reviewed from 3/2017-5/2020 to identify patients who underwent POEM after prior bariatric surgery. Efficacy was assessed by technical success (defined as the ability to successfully complete the procedure) and clinical success [decrease in Eckardt score (ES) to ≤ 3 post procedure]. Safety was evaluated by recording adverse events. RESULTS Six patients (50% male, mean age 48 years) with a history of prior bariatric surgery who underwent POEM were included. Three had prior sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and three prior Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Four patients had achalasia subtype II and 2 had type I. Most (4) patients had undergone previous achalasia therapy. Technical success was 100%. Clinical success was achieved in 4 (67%) patients at mean follow-up of 21 mo. In one of the clinical failures, EndoFLIP evaluation demonstrated adequate treatment and candida esophagitis was noted as the likely cause of dysphagia. There were no major adverse events. CONCLUSION POEM is technically feasible after both RYGB and SG and offers an effective treatment for this rare group of patients where surgical options for achalasia are limited.","Kolb, Jennifer M; Jonas, Daniel; Funari, Mateus Pereira; Hammad, Hazem; Menard-Katcher, Paul; Wagh, Mihir S",World journal of gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.4253/wjge.v12.i12.532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33362906/,470

Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is a novel surgical technique that uses the natural orifices of the human body as entrances to the abdominal cavity. An alternative concept of minimally invasive approach to the abdominal cavity is to insert all the laparoscopic instruments through ports using a single small incision on the abdominal wall. A suggested name for this technique is laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS). Considering the technical difficulties in NOTES and LESS and the progress in informatics and robotics, the use of robots seems ideal. The aim of this study is to investigate if there is at present, a realistic possibility of using miniature robots in NOTES or LESS in daily clinical practice. An up-to-date review on in vivo surgical miniature robots is made. A Web-based research of the English literature up to March 2013 using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar as search engines was performed. The development of in vivo miniature robots for use in NOTES or LESS is a reality with great advancements, potential advantages, and possible application in minimally invasive surgery in the future.

Advanced stage patients of EC have poor prognosis. Inevitable side effects and treatment tolerance of chemotherapy for EC remain to be addressed. Our results in this study showed that EC cells with higher tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4 (TRAF4) expression have lower sensitivity to poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitors. Upon TRAF4 knockdown, the colony numbers of EC cells were markedly down-regulated, and the markers of DNA double-strand breakage were significantly up-regulated after the treatment of olaparib, a PARP1 inhibitor. TRAF4 knockdown reduced the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), promoted DNA double-strand breakage, and decreased levels of DNA repair related proteins, including phosphorylated-DNA-dependent protein kinase (p-DNA-PK) and RAD51 recombinase (RAD51). In addition, TRAF4's effect on the sensitivity of EC cells to olaparib was further found to be mainly mediated by Akt phosphorylation. Moreover, in vivo results showed that TRAF4 knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of EC to PARP1 inhibitors using a mouse xenograft model. Collectively, our data suggest that combined application of TRAF4 knockdown and PARP1 inhibition can be used as a promising strategy for synthetic lethality in EC treatment.","Tang, Liulin; Wang, Min; Jiang, Li; Zeng, Chengying",Human cell,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13577-020-00363-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388810/,470

OBJECTIVES To assess the prevalence and distribution of SOS teeth with regard to age and sex difference among young to middle-aged adults. METHODS This is a cross-sectional records-based study of a nationally representative sample, consisting of young to middle-aged military personnel, who attended the military dental clinics of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for one year. SOS teeth definition corresponds to code number 6 of the ""Caries Assessment Spectrum and Treatment (CAST)"" as an instrument to assess dental caries. Data pertaining to age and sex were drawn from the central demographic database and that of SOS teeth were obtained from the Dental Patient Record (DPR). RESULTS The study included 132,529 dental records. The prevalence of patients with SOS teeth was 9.18 % (12,146/132,323). The number of teeth that were found to be SOS teeth was 18,300, i.e., 1.5 SOS teeth per ""diseased"" patient (18,300/12,146). The mean number of SOS teeth per the whole study population was 0.14 ± 0.52 and the range was 0-20.

93882,"Mortality, Admissions, and Patient Census at SNFs in 3 US Cities During the COVID-19 Pandemic.",2020-06-24,"BACKGROUND The United States has had, by far, the world's greatest civilian ownership of firearms. An even greater ownership occurred during the Covd-19 pandemic, mostly of handguns and including many new owners. The U.S. has also had the least progress of the 41 highest sociodemographic countries ranked by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in reducing the unintentional firearm mortality rate in young children. This study characterized the unintentional firearm mortality trends in American 1-4 year-olds by sex and race/ethnicity and evaluated the trends in the context of firearm prevalence in the U.S. METHODS Mortality data for 1999-2018 were obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, firearm injury and mortality data for 2016-2020 from Everytown for Gun Safety #NotAnAccident database, firearm background check data for 1999-2020 from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and civilian firearm prevalence for 2017 from the Small Arms Survey. RESULTS In American 1-4 year-olds, the rate of unintentional firearm deaths during 1999-2018 increased exponentially at an average annual percent rate of 4.9 (p < 0.001) and was greatest in non-Hispanic black children. Unintentional firearm deaths had the most rapid increase of all evaluable causes of death in the age group. The unintentional firearm death rate increase was correlated with the concurrent rate of firearm background checks and handgun permits issued (each p < 0.001) and in non-Hispanic white children with handgun prevalence in their families (p = 0.03). Globally, the unintentional firearm death rate was also correlated with firearm prevalence (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS An increase in fatal firearm accidents in the United States death rate among 1-4 year-olds is directly associated with the steadily increasing prevalence of firearms. The acceleration of firearm deaths and injuries among young Americans, especially among non-Hispanic black children, requires urgent solutions to address firearm prevalence and access. The problem is expected to become even more urgent as a result of the record high firearm sales that occurred in the United States during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.","Bleyer, Archie; Siegel, Stuart E; Thomas, Charles R",Journal of the National Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2020.12.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33446333/,470

Well-ordered periodic surface ripple/finger patterns were observed during the adhesion and coalescence, which eventually disappeared, leaving smooth polymer-air interfaces. The life-times of these transient well-ordered patterns depend on the viscosity and film thickness of the polymer melts. These observations are in contrast to the conventional understanding that liquid-liquid coalescence usually occurs with the deforming surfaces remaining smoothly curved at all stages, with no esoteric shape-transitions. The results reveal a new feature associated with liquid-liquid adhesion/coalescence, which may be of key importance for a full understanding of coalescence processes. We propose an explanation for the observed phenomenon in terms of simple physical concepts, and discuss other microscopic and macroscopic (including biological) systems where similar effects are likely to occur.","Zeng, Hongbo; Zhao, Boxin; Tian, Yu; Tirrell, Matthew; Leal, L Gary; Israelachvili, Jacob N",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/b613198k; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680198/,470

However, there is no systematic review to comprehensively address patient portal interventions and patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to synthesize evidence with regard to the characteristics and psychobehavioral and clinical outcomes of patient portal interventions. METHODS In November 2018, we conducted searches in 3 electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and a total of 24 articles met the eligibility criteria. RESULTS All but 3 studies were conducted in the United States. The types of study designs varied, and samples predominantly involved non-Hispanic white and highly educated patients with sizes ranging from 50 to 22,703. Most of the portal interventions used tailored alerts or educational resources tailored to the patient's condition. Patient portal interventions lead to improvements in a wide range of psychobehavioral outcomes, such as health knowledge, self-efficacy, decision making, medication adherence, and preventive service use. Effects of patient portal interventions on clinical outcomes including blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, and weight loss were mixed. CONCLUSIONS Patient portal interventions were overall effective in improving a few psychological outcomes, medication adherence, and preventive service use. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of patient portals to improve clinical outcomes. Understanding the role of patient portals as an effective intervention strategy is an essential step to encourage patients to be actively engaged in their health care.","Han, Hae-Ra; Gleason, Kelly T; Sun, Chun-An; Miller, Hailey N; Kang, Soo Jin; Chow, Sotera; Anderson, Rachel; Nagy, Paul; Bauer, Tom",JMIR human factors,https://doi.org/10.2196/15038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31855187/,470
95862,COVID-19 Pandemic in India: Tackling the Situation and Supporting the Auxilliary Staff!!,2020-09-08,"Nowadays, computational approaches play an important role in the design of new drug-like compounds and optimization of pharmacotherapeutic treatment of diseases. The emerging growth of viral infections, including those caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Ebola virus, recently detected coronavirus, and some others, leads to many newly infected people with a high risk of death or severe complications. A huge amount of chemical, biological, clinical data is at the disposal of the researchers. Therefore, there are many opportunities to find the relationships between the particular features of chemical data and the antiviral activity of biologically active compounds based on machine learning approaches. Biological and clinical data can also be used for building models to predict relationships between viral genotype and drug resistance, which might help determine the clinical outcome of treatment. In the current study, we consider machine-learning approaches in the antiviral research carried out during the past decade. We overview in detail the application of machine-learning methods for the design of new potential antiviral agents and vaccines, drug resistance prediction, and analysis of virus-host interactions. Our review also covers the perspectives of using the machine-learning approaches for antiviral research, including Dengue, Ebola viruses, Influenza A, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, coronaviruses, and some others.","Tarasova, Olga; Poroikov, Vladimir",Current medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/0929867328666210504114351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33949929/,470
96236,Telemedicine for contraceptive counseling: an exploratory survey of US family planning providers following rapid adoption of services during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-11-16,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is gaining popularity among minimally invasive surgeons and is now being applied to a broad number of surgical procedures. Although this technique uses only 1 port, the diameter of the incision is larger than in standard laparoscopic surgery. The long-term incidence of port-site hernias after single-incision laparoscopic surgery has yet to be determined. METHODS All patients who underwent a single-incision laparoscopic surgical procedure from May 2008 through May 2009 were included in the study. Single-incision laparoscopic surgical operations were performed either by a multiport technique or with a 3-trocar single-incision laparoscopic surgery port. The patients were seen at 30 to 36 months' follow-up, at which time they were examined for any evidence of port-site incisional hernia. Patients found to have hernias on clinical examination underwent repairs with mesh. RESULTS A total of 211 patients met the criteria for inclusion in the study. The types of operations included were cholecystectomy, appendectomy, sleeve gastrectomy, gastric banding, Nissen fundoplication, colectomy, and gastrojejunostomy. We found a port-site hernia rate of 2.9% at 30 to 36 months' follow-up. CONCLUSION Port-site incisional hernia after single-incision laparoscopic surgical procedures remains a major setback for patients. The true incidence remains largely unknown because most patients are asymptomatic and therefore do not seek surgical aid.","Agaba, Emmanuel Atta; Rainville, Harvey; Ikedilo, Ojinika; Vemulapali, Pratibha",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680813x13693422518317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24960483/,470

The first group consisted of 10 patients suffering from benign gastric tumors treated by standard laparoscopic resection. The second group included 10 patients treated using the single-port technique. All procedures were successfully completed. Histopathologic examination confirmed 15 cases of gastrointestinal stromal tumor, 3 cases of lipoma, 1 case of leiomyoma, and 1 case of high-grade dysplasia. There was no statistically significant difference for the operation times between both groups. Comparison of the largest and smallest resection margins achieved using the standard laparoscopic technique and single-port techniques showed no statistically significant differences between the groups. During follow-up, all patients were evaluated using the total body image and cosmesis questionnaire. Although scores of all body-image functions were similar, independent of laparoscopic technique, scores of all cosmetic functions in patients operated using the single-port technique showed a statistically significant higher degree of satisfaction with the scar (P<0185). The postoperative pain scores evaluated by the visual analog scale score were not significantly different between 2 groups. The single-port technique was found to be a feasible option for the resection of submucosal or mucosal tumors. However, this method is not intended to replace standard laparoscopic resections.","Patrzyk, Maciej; Glitsch, Anne; Schreiber, André; Busemann, Alexandra; Partecke, Lars I; Heidecke, Claus D","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e31828e3fe1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23917596/,470

The BMSC-sEV was isolated by Exosome Isolation™ reagent and identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and western blotting (WB). The human periodontal stem cells (hPDLCs) were co-cultured with BMSC-sEV in vitro to detect the effects of BMSC-sEV on hPDLCs migration, proliferation and differentiation. The BMSC-sEV loaded by hydrogel was injected into experimental periodontitis rats to verify the therapeutic effect and possible mechanism. The results showed that BMSC-sEV was 30-150 nm vesicles and expressed the exosomes protein CD63 and tumor susceptibility 101 (TSG101), which could promote the migration, proliferation, osteogenic differentiation of hPDLCs. The BMSC-sEV-hydrogel had a therapeutic effect on periodontitis rats. After administration for four to eight weeks, micro-CT and histological analysis showed the alveolar bone loss (ABL), inflammatory infiltration and collagen destruction in BMSC-sEV-hydrogel group were less than that in PBS-hydrogel group and periodontitis group. The further immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining revealed that the number of Trap positive cells and the expression ratio of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor-activator of nuclear factor kappa beta ligand (RANKL) in BMSC-sEV-hydrogel group were lower than that in PBS-hydrogel group and periodontitis group, while the expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) and the ratio of macrophages type 2 and macrophages type 1(M2/M1) were opposite. Therefore, BMSC-sEV can promote the regeneration of periodontal tissues, and that may be partly due to BMSC-sEV involve in the OPG-RANKL-RANK signaling pathway to regulate the function of osteoclasts and affect the macrophages polarization and TGF-β1 expression to modulate the inflammatory immune response, thereby inhibiting the development of periodontitis and immune damage of periodontal tissue.","Liu, Li; Guo, Shujuan; Shi, Weiwei; Liu, Qian; Huo, Fangjun; Wu, Yafei; Tian, Weidong",Tissue engineering.

Consistency between MRI features and differential DNAm is modest. Sources of bias: variable inclusion of comparator groups; different surrogate tissues used; variation in DNAm measurement methods; lack of control for genotype and cell-type composition; and variations in image processing. Knowledge of MRI features associated with differential DNAm may improve understanding of the role of DNAm in brain health and disease, but caution is required because conventions for linking DNAm and MRI data are not established, and clinical and methodological heterogeneity in existing literature is substantial.","Wheater, Emily N W; Stoye, David Q; Cox, Simon R; Wardlaw, Joanna M; Drake, Amanda J; Bastin, Mark E; Boardman, James P",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.03.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32151655/,470

The current study aimed to assess the prevalence, related factors, and mechanism of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) among health professionals in Wuhan during this critical period. METHODS The study used a cross-sectional design. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the frontline health professionals in Wuhan hospitals from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Mental health related measurements included ASD, depression, anxiety, conflict experiences, hostility, and psychosomatic symptoms. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the factors associated with ASD among health professionals. RESULTS A total of 332 frontline health professionals were included in the analysis (mean age 32.21±8.77 years; 78.0% women). ASD was a prominent mental health problem in the health professionals surveyed, with a prevalence of 38.3%. Anxiety (24.7%) and depression (20.2%) were also common. SEM analyses revealed that emotional distress (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms) fully mediated the association between conflicts with ASD (the standardized indirect coefficient β=0.47, p=0.016). The most common reported symptom was chest pain (51.2%). ASD was significantly associated with psychosomatic symptoms. The majority (67.8%) reported being easily annoyed or irritated and ASD was associated with hostility. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 outbreak, a substantial number of health professionals in Wuhan suffered from ASD. Furthermore, ASD was found to be associated with psychosomatic symptoms as well as the hostility. The poor mental health of health professionals has detrimental impacts both on the wellbeing of staff in healthcare systems and may adversely affect the quality of patient care. We call for interventions that aim to relieve the psychological and occupational stress. Considering most of our participants were young, female frontline health professionals, the results may not be generalized to more heterogenous samples.","Wang, YuanYuan; Duan, Zhizhou; Peng, Ke; Li, Dan; Ou, Jianjun; Wilson, Amanda; Wang, Nan; Si, Lei; Chen, Runsen",Psychosomatic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/psy.0000000000000851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32815855/,470

OBJECTIVE To compare the long-term outcomes of conservative management vs intervention for unruptured bAVM. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION Population-based inception cohort study of 204 residents of Scotland aged 16 years or older who were first diagnosed as having an unruptured bAVM during 1999-2003 or 2006-2010 and followed up prospectively for 12 years. EXPOSURES Conservative management (no intervention) vs intervention (any endovascular embolization, neurosurgical excision, or stereotactic radiosurgery alone or in combination). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cox regression analyses, with multivariable adjustment for prognostic factors and baseline imbalances if hazards were proportional, to compare rates of the primary outcome (death or sustained morbidity of any cause by Oxford Handicap Scale [OHS] score ≥2 for ≥2 successive years [0 = no symptoms and 6 = death]) and the secondary outcome (nonfatal symptomatic stroke or death due to bAVM, associated arterial aneurysm, or intervention). RESULTS Of 204 patients, 103 underwent intervention. Those who underwent intervention were younger, more likely to have presented with seizure, and less likely to have large bAVMs than patients managed conservatively. During a median follow-up of 6.9 years (94% completeness), the rate of progression to the primary outcome was lower with conservative management during the first 4 years of follow-up (36 vs 39 events; 9.5 vs 9.8 per 100 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35-0.99), but rates were similar thereafter. The rate of the secondary outcome was lower with conservative management during 12 years of follow-up (14 vs 38 events; 1.6 vs 3.3 per 100 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19-0.72). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients aged 16 years or older diagnosed as having unruptured bAVM, use of conservative management compared with intervention was associated with better clinical outcomes for up to 12 years.

METHODS Here we report the variability of six consecutive 30 s measurements performed in 27 healthy term infants at rest. Poor data quality excluded four infants. RESULTS Mean cerebral oxygenation was 59.6 ± 8.0%, with intra-subject standard deviation of 3.4%, that is, coefficient of variation (CV) of 5.7%. The inter-subject CV was 13.5%. Mean blood flow index was 2.7 × 10-8 ± 1.56 × 10-8 (cm2/s), with intra-subject CV of 27% and inter-subject CV of 56%. The variability in blood flow index was not reduced by the use of individual measures of tissue scattering, nor accompanied by a parallel variability in cerebral oxygenation. CONCLUSION The intra-subject variability for cerebral oxygenation variability was improved compared to spatially resolved spectroscopy devices, while for the blood flow index it was comparable to that of other modalities for estimating cerebral blood flow in newborn infants. Most importantly, the simultaneous measurement of oxygenation and flow allows for interpretation of the high inter-subject variability of cerebral blood flow as being due to error of measurement rather than to physiological instability.","Andresen, Bjørn; De Carli, Agnese; Fumagalli, Monica; Giovannella, Martina; Durduran, Turgut; Michael Weigel, Udo; Contini, Davide; Spinelli, Lorenzo; Torricelli, Alessandro; Greisen, Gorm",Pediatric research,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0474-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31234195/,470

MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-five patients with postoperative chylothorax underwent Lipiodol lymphangiography (LLG) between February 2016 and November 2019. If targetable central lymphatic vessels were identified in LLG, TDC, a prerequisite for TDE, was attempted. While the conventional antegrade transabdominal approach was the standard TDC method, the retrograde approach was applied as a bail-out method. Embolization, the last step of TDE, was performed after confirming leakages in the trans-TDC catheter lymphangiography. Technical and clinical success rates were determined retrospectively. RESULTS TDC was attempted in 40 among 45 patients based on LLG findings. The technical success rate of TDC with the conventional antegrade approach was 78% (31/40). In addition, six more patients were cannulated using the bail-out retrograde approach, which raised the technical success rate to 93% (37/40). While 35 patients underwent embolization (TDE group), ten patients did not (non-TDE group) for the following reasons: (1) lack of targetable lymphatics for TDC in LLG (n = 5), (2) technical failure of TDC (n = 3), and (3) lack of discernible leakages in the transcatheter lymphangiography (n = 2). The clinical success of the TDE group was 89% (31/35), compared with 50% (5/10) of the non-TDE group. One major procedure-related complication was bile peritonitis caused by the needle passage of the distended gallbladder. CONCLUSIONS Bail-out retrograde approach for TDC could improve the overall technical success of TDC significantly. KEY POINTS • Bail-out retrograde thoracic duct access may improve the overall technical success of thoracic duct access, thus improving the clinical success of thoracic duct embolization.","Jun, Hoyong; Hur, Saebeom; Jeong, Yun Soo; Kang, Chang Hyun; Lee, Hyukjoon",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-021-08145-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34247305/,470

Participants were 907 Polish people (522 women and 385 men). We used the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FOC-6), Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-29) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. The relationship between stress and life satisfaction was mediated by the sense of coherence, and the relationship between stress and sense of coherence was moderated by fear of COVID-19. The fear of COVID-19 acted as a buffer in the relationship between stress and sense of coherence weakening the impact of stress on the sense of coherence. This study is the first to verify the proposed model of moderated mediation during the COVID-19 pandemic and was undertaken in a very large sample. This manuscript highlights the important role of the fear of COVID-19 and sense of coherence in our well-being. An individual's sense of coherence can affect their subjective well-being and help them to effectively manage stress and reduce anxiety.","Dymecka, Joanna; Gerymski, Rafał; Machnik-Czerwik, Anna","Psychology, health & medicine",https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1906436; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33784897/,470

Once formed, all vessels of the vasculature system present an endothelial monolayer (the endothelium), lining the luminal wall of the vessels, that regulates gas and nutrient exchange between the circulating blood and tissues, contributing to maintaining tissue and vascular homeostasis. To perform their functions, endothelial cells integrate signalling pathways promoted by growth factors, cytokines, extracellular matrix components and signals from mechanosensory complexes sensing the blood flow. New evidence shows that endothelial cells rely on specific metabolic pathways for distinct cellular functions and that the integration of signalling and metabolic pathways regulates endothelial-dependent processes such as angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis. In this review, we provide an overview of endothelial functions and the recent advances in understanding the role of endothelial signalling and metabolism in physiological processes such as angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis and vascular diseases. Also, we focus on the signalling pathways promoted by the transmembrane protein Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) in endothelial cells, its recently discovered role in regulating mitochondrial function and iron homeostasis and the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and iron in atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases.","Bosseboeuf, Emy; Raimondi, Claudio",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9092055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911833/,470

The aim of this randomized active comparator-controlled study was to compare the effectiveness of LigasureTM Exact to previously existing sealing devices in patients undergoing thyroidectomy. Methods A total of 180 patients were randomly allocated into 4 groups according to the hemostatic device used: Focus Harmonic Scalpel® (FHS), LigasureTM Small Jaw (LSJ), Thunderbeat® (TB), and LigasureTM Exact (LE). We recorded epidemiologic and biochemical data, operative difficulty, postoperative vocal alteration and pain, complications, operating time, grams of gland excised per minute, and hospitalization. Results Differences (P<0.001) were observed concerning duration of surgery, operative difficulty and quantity of gland removed per minute. Concerning duration of surgery it is shorter for LE followed by TB and then by both FHS and LSJ. Concerning the quantity of thyroid removed per minute LE leads, followed by FHS and TB. The least amount of gland removed per minute is by LSJ. Finally, operative difficulty was less for LE, while it was equal for all other three devices. Conclusions Energy devices are now frequently used in thyroidectomy. Comparing these devices seems to qualify them as equal concerning post-operative complications, hemostasis, and acute inflammatory reaction. However, LigasureTM Exact Dissector seems to have better results concerning duration of surgery, quantity of thyroid tissue removed per minute and intraoperative difficulty.","Papavramidis, Theodosios S; Pliakos, Ioannis; Chorti, Angeliki; Panidis, Stavros; Kotsovolis, George; Stelmach, Veronica; Koutsoumparis, Dimitris; Bakkar, Sohail; Michalopoulos, Antonios",Gland surgery,https://doi.org/10.21037/gs.2020.02.05; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420251/,470

Hepatocyte-driven liver regeneration that involves the proliferation of preexisting hepatocytes is a primary regeneration mode. On the other hand, liver progenitor cell (LPC)-driven liver regeneration that involves dedifferentiation of biliary epithelial cells or hepatocytes into LPCs, LPC proliferation, and subsequent differentiation of LPCs into hepatocytes is a secondary mode. This secondary mode plays a significant role in liver regeneration when the primary mode does not effectively work, as observed in severe liver injury settings. Thus, promoting LPC-driven liver regeneration may be clinically beneficial to patients with severe liver diseases. In this review, we describe the current understanding of LPC-driven liver regeneration by exploring current knowledge on the activation, origin, and roles of LPCs during regeneration. We also describe animal models used to study LPC-driven liver regeneration, given their potential to further deepen our understanding of the regeneration process. This understanding will eventually contribute to developing strategies to promote LPC-driven liver regeneration in patients with severe liver diseases.","So, Juhoon; Kim, Angie; Lee, Seung-Hoon; Shin, Donghun",Experimental & molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s12276-020-0483-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796957/,470

The objective of the present study was to generate reliable information on the oxalate content and antioxidant activity in different foods and classify them by very low, low, medium, high and very high oxalate content and antioxidant activity. METHODS The oxalate content of 109 foods including ethnic foods was assessed by an enzymatic assay, and the antioxidant activity was measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity to determine the oxalate/antioxidant activity ratio. Oxalate consumption was then evaluated in 400 subjects with overweight and obesity using 24-h dietary recalls. RESULTS The main foods with high oxalate content were raw spinach, huanzontle, purslane, chard, almond, and toasted and sweetened roasted amaranth. The highest antioxidant activity was found in strawberries, all types of chocolates, roselle, morita peppers, and pinolillo. Subjects with overweight or obesity exceed the dietary oxalate daily intake recommendation. CONCLUSIONS The classification of foods by their oxalate content and antioxidant activity will be very useful to generate nutritional recommendation in different diseases, mainly UL.","Avila-Nava, Azalia; Medina-Vera, Isabel; Rodríguez-Hernández, Pamela; Guevara-Cruz, Martha; Heredia-G Canton, Pamela K; Tovar, Armando R; Torres, Nimbe",Journal of renal nutrition : the official journal of the Council on Renal Nutrition of the National Kidney Foundation,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jrn.2020.04.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709427/,470

This study reports one-year outcomes from patients enrolled in the prospective global Amulet registry. METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 1,088 patients were recruited, aged 75±9 years; 65% of patients were male. The CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores were 4.2±1.6 and 3.3±1.1, respectively. Eighty-three percent (83%) of patients had contraindications to anticoagulation (OAC); 72% had a history of major bleeding. An AMPLATZER Amulet LAA occluder was successfully implanted in 99% of cases. Transoesophageal echocardiography one to three months after implant showed no residual flow or flow <3 mm in 98.4%. The observed ischaemic stroke rate was 2.9%/year. Device-related thrombus was noted in 1.7% of patients. There were ten cases between 0 and 90 days and eight cases between 91 and 365 days. Patients discharged without OAC (>80%), in particular those on single aspirin therapy, did not appear to have a higher risk of device-related thrombus. In the first year, major bleeding occurred at an annualised rate of 10.3%. All-cause mortality was 8.4% at one year. CONCLUSIONS In the global prospective Amulet registry of patients at high risk of stroke and bleeding, the annualised ischaemic stroke rate was 2.9%.

111875,Barriers to and Facilitators of Implementing Peer Support Services for Criminal Justice-Involved Individuals.,2021-03-18,"Particulate matter (PM) is a crucial health risk factor for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The smaller size fractions, ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5; fine particles) and ≤0.1 μm (PM0.1; ultrafine particles), show the highest bioactivity but acquiring sufficient mass for in vitro and in vivo toxicological studies is challenging. We review the suitability of available instrumentation to collect the PM mass required for these assessments. Five different microenvironments representing the diverse exposure conditions in urban environments are considered in order to establish the typical PM concentrations present. The highest concentrations of PM2.5 and PM0.1 were found near traffic (i.e. roadsides and traffic intersections), followed by indoor environments, parks and behind roadside vegetation. We identify key factors to consider when selecting sampling instrumentation. These include PM concentration on-site (low concentrations increase sampling time), nature of sampling sites (e.g. indoors; noise and space will be an issue), equipment handling and power supply. Physicochemical characterisation requires micro- to milli-gram quantities of PM and it may increase according to the processing methods (e.g. digestion or sonication). Toxicological assessments of PM involve numerous mechanisms (e.g. inflammatory processes and oxidative stress) requiring significant amounts of PM to obtain accurate results. Optimising air sampling techniques are therefore important for the appropriate collection medium/filter which have innate physical properties and the potential to interact with samples. An evaluation of methods and instrumentation used for airborne virus collection concludes that samplers operating cyclone sampling techniques (using centrifugal forces) are effective in collecting airborne viruses. We highlight that predictive modelling can help to identify pollution hotspots in an urban environment for the efficient collection of PM mass. This review provides guidance to prepare and plan efficient sampling campaigns to collect sufficient PM mass for various purposes in a reasonable timeframe.","Kumar, Prashant; Kalaiarasan, Gopinath; Porter, Alexandra E; Pinna, Alessandra; Kłosowski, Michał M; Demokritou, Philip; Chung, Kian Fan; Pain, Christopher; Arvind, D K; Arcucci, Rossella; Adcock, Ian M; Dilliway, Claire",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143553; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33239200/,470
113316,Drawing on emotions: the evolving role of art therapy.,2021-04-19,"INTRODUCTION Evidence exists that unblinded randomised clinical trials (RCTs) overestimate intervention effects compared with blinded RCTs. It has been suggested that this is less pronounced for objective (ie, not subject to interpretation) outcome measures, including mortality. This may not apply in the intensive care unit (ICU), as most deaths are preceded by decisions to withhold or withdraw treatments. Lack of blinding of physicians in RCTs of ICU interventions may potentially influence the decision towards a higher threshold for discontinuing treatment in patients who receive the investigational treatment and/or a lower threshold for discontinuing treatment in patients who receive the comparator (control). This may have important implications for patients, caregivers, researchers and society. Accordingly, we aim to assess whether lack of blinding affects mortality effect estimates in RCTs of ICU interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review with meta-analyses and assess the effect of blinding versus no blinding on mortality effect estimates in RCTs of interventions used in adult ICU patients.We will systematically search the Cochrane Library for systematic reviews reporting mortality effect estimates of any intervention used in adult ICU patients which includes at least one RCT with 'low risk of bias' in the bias domains 'blinding of participants and personnel' and/or 'blinding of outcome assessment' and one RCT with 'unclear' or 'high risk of bias' in the same bias domain(s). For each intervention, we will compare summary mortality effect estimates in blinded versus unblinded trials. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This research does not require ethical approval as we will use summary data from trials already approved by relevant ethical institutions. We will report the results in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement and submit the final paper to an international peer-reviewed journal.

113345,Psychological problems among the university students in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-09-13,"BACKGROUND Brain scans are essential to exclude haemorrhage in patients with suspected acute ischaemic stroke before treatment with alteplase. However, patients with early ischaemic signs could be at increased risk of haemorrhage after alteplase treatment, and little information is available about whether pre-existing structural signs, which are common in older patients, affect response to alteplase. We aimed to investigate the association between imaging signs on brain CT and outcomes after alteplase. METHODS IST-3 was a multicentre, randomised controlled trial of intravenous alteplase (0·9 mg/kg) versus control within 6 h of acute ischaemic stroke. The primary outcome was independence at 6 months (defined as an Oxford Handicap Scale [OHS] score of 0-2). 3035 patients were enrolled to IST-3 and underwent prerandomisation brain CT. Experts who were unaware of the random allocation assessed scans for early signs of ischaemia (tissue hypoattenuation, infarct extent, swelling, and hyperattenuated artery) and pre-existing signs (old infarct, leukoaraiosis, and atrophy). In this prespecified analysis, we assessed interactions between these imaging signs, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (a secondary outcome in IST-3) and independence at 6 months, and alteplase, adjusting for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and time to randomisation. This trial is registered at ISRCTN.com, number ISRCTN25765518. FINDINGS 3017 patients were assessed in this analysis, of whom 1507 were allocated alteplase and 1510 were assigned control. A reduction in independence was predicted by tissue hypoattenuation (odds ratio 0·66, 95% CI 0·55-0·81), large lesion (0·51, 0·38-0·68), swelling (0·59, 0·46-0·75), hyperattenuated artery (0·59, 0·47-0·75), atrophy (0·74, 0·59-0·94), and leukoaraiosis (0·72, 0·59-0·87). Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was predicted by old infarct (odds ratio 1·72, 95% CI 1·18-2·51), tissue hypoattenuation (1·54, 1·04-2·27), and hyperattenuated artery (1·54, 1·03-2·29). Some combinations of signs increased the absolute risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (eg, both old infarct and hyperattenuated artery, excess with alteplase 13·8%, 95% CI 6·9-20·7; both signs absent, excess 3·2%, 1·4-5·1). However, no imaging findings-individually or combined-modified the effect of alteplase on independence or symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. INTERPRETATION Some early ischaemic and pre-existing signs were associated with reduced independence at 6 months and increased symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. Although no interaction was noted between brain imaging signs and effects of alteplase on these outcomes, some combinations of signs increased some absolute risks. Pre-existing signs should be considered, in addition to early ischaemic signs, during the assessment of patients with acute ischaemic stroke.

However, the percentage of outpatient urological cases that could be managed completely by telemedicine outside of the COVID-19 pandemic remains to be determined. We conducted a prospective, multisite study involving all urologists working in the region of Quebec City. METHODS During the first four weeks of the regional confinement, 18 pediatric and adult urologists were asked to determine, after each telemedicine appointment, if it translated into a complete (CCM), incomplete (ICM), or suboptimal case management (SCM, adequate only in the context of the pandemic). RESULTS A total of 1679 appointments representing all urological areas were registered. Overall, 67.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 65.3; 69.8), 27.1% (25.0; 29.3), and 4.3% (3.5; 5.4) were reported as CCM, SCM, and ICM, respectively. The CCM ratio varied according to the reason for consultation, with cancer suspicion (52.9% [42.9; 62.8]) and pediatric reasons (38.0% [30.0; 46.6]) showing the lowest CCM percentages. CCM percentages also varied significantly based on the setting where it was performed, ranging from 61.1% (private clinic) to 86.8% (endourology and general hospital). CONCLUSIONS We show that two-thirds of all urological outpatient cases could be completely managed by telemedicine outside of the pandemic. After the pandemic, it will be important to incorporate telemedicine as an alternative for a patient's first or followup visit, especially those with geographical, pathological, and socioeconomic considerations.","Turcotte, Bruno; Paquet, Sophie; Blais, Anne-Sophie; Blouin, Annie-Claude; Bolduc, Stéphane; Bureau, Michel; Caumartin, Yves; Cloutier, Jonathan; Deschênes-Rompré, Marie-Pier; Dujardin, Thierry; Fradet, Yves; Lacombe, Louis; Moore, Katherine; Morin, Fannie; Nadeau, Geneviève; Simonyan, David; Soucy, Frédéric; Tiguert, Rabi; Toren, Paul; Lodde, Michele; Pouliot, Frédéric",Canadian Urological Association journal = Journal de l'Association des urologues du Canada,https://doi.org/10.5489/cuaj.6862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275552/,470

For conditions within the respiratory tract, targeted drug delivery directly to the site of action can achieve a high local concentration for efficacy with reduced unwanted systemic exposure and adverse effect. For systemic conditions, the unique physiology of the lung evolutionarily designed for rapid gaseous exchange presents an entry route for systemic drug delivery. Although the development of inhaled formulations has come a long way over the last few decades, many aspects of it remain to be elucidated. In particular, a reliable and well-understood method for in vitro-in vivo correlations remains to be established. With the rapid and ongoing advancement of technology, there is much potential to better utilise computational methods including different types of modelling and simulation approaches to support inhaled formulation development. This review intends to provide an introduction on some fundamental concepts in pulmonary drug delivery and inhaled formulation development followed by discussions on some challenges and opportunities in the translation of inhaled pharmaceuticals from preclinical studies to clinical development. The review concludes with some recent advancements in modelling and simulation approaches that could play an increasingly important role in contemporary formulation development of inhaled pharmaceuticals.","Sou, Tomás; Bergström, Christel A S",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2020.09.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916138/,470

All patients underwent clinical and laboratory examinations, including liver-specific parameters at certain times before and after mapping angiography/99mTc-MAA administration, as well as before radioembolization and during follow-up. RESULTS Bilirubin increased temporarily after 99mTc-MAA administration (p<0.001), but was not clinically relevant, and returned close to the initial value before radioembolization. These changes showed no association with subsequent postradioembolic hepatotoxicity or shortened overall survival.

However, thus far, no analysis of how such barriers affect elderly people with disabilities (PwD) has been conducted. Thus, the study investigates the predictors of eHealth usage among elderly PwD. METHODS Using data from a 2018 nationwide disability survey comprising 14,798 respondents in Australia, multivariate logistic regression models are used to predict the relationship between eHealth usage and the various characteristics of respondents, including access to information and communication technologies (ICTs), socioeconomic status, and level of education. RESULTS Although most participants (approximately 88%) have access to ICTs, few (only around 9%) have used eHealth services. The results show a number of factors are associated with an increased likelihood of using eHealth services, including higher educational attainment (odds ratio [OR] = 3.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.38, 4.24), employment (OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.94), higher household income (OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.96), and ICT access (OR = 15.92, 95% CI: 10.51, 27.01).

In addition, the estimates from interaction effects suggest the effect of ICT penetration on use of eHealth falls by a negligible amount because of resistive attitudinal barriers (OR = 0.01, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.06). CONCLUSION Given the challenges of ageing populations and pandemics, such as COVID-19, eHealth services are a vital part of an effective, inclusive, and robust health care system. This study demonstrates the presence of a significant digital divide among elderly PwD and suggests that public and private efforts should be made to increase the availability of ICT infrastructure. Training could also increase inclusion in this regard.","Ali, Mohammad Afshar; Alam, Khorshed; Taylor, Brad; Ashraf, Mahfuz",International journal of medical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2021.104411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33618191/,470

OBJECTIVE To determine whether the relationship between surgeon volume and outcomes is an artifact of case mix using a prospective sample of carotid endarterectomy cases. DESIGN Observational cohort study from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2010, with preoperative, immediate postoperative, and 30-day postoperative assessments acquired by independent monitors. SETTING Urban, tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS All 841 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy performed by a vascular surgeon or cerebrovascular neurosurgeon at the institution. INTERVENTION Carotid endarterectomy without another concurrent surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Stroke, death, and other surgical complications occurring within 30 days of surgery along with other case data. A low-volume surgeon performed 40 or fewer cases per year. Variables used in a comparison administrative database study, as well as variables identified by our univariate analysis, were used for adjusted analyses to assess for an association between low-volume surgeons and the rate of stroke and death as well as other complications. RESULTS The rate of stroke and death was 6.9% for low-volume surgeons and 2.0% for high-volume surgeons (P = .001). Complications were similarly higher (13.4% vs 7.2%, P = .008). Low-volume surgeons performed more nonelective cases. Low-volume surgeons were significantly associated with stroke and death in the unadjusted analysis as well as after adjustment with variables used in the administrative database study (odds ratio, 3.61; 95% CI, 1.70-7.67, and odds ratio, 3.68; 95% CI, 1.72-7.89, respectively). However, adjusting for the significant disparity of American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification in case mix eliminated the effect of surgeon volume on the rate of stroke and death (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% CI, 0.59-4.64) and other complications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Variables selected for risk adjustment in studies using administrative databases appear to be inadequate to control for case mix bias between low-volume and high-volume surgeons. Risk adjustment should empirically analyze for case mix imbalances between surgeons to identify meaningful risk modifiers in clinical practice such as the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification. A true relationship between surgeon volume and outcomes remains uncertain, and caution is advised in developing policies based on these findings.","Maas, Matthew B; Jaff, Michael R; Rordorf, Guy A",JAMA surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamasurg.2013.1509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23426886/,470

METHODS Systematic analysis of all non-ICU patient hospitalizations for COVID-19 completing discharge between March 13 and May 1, 2020, in a large US health care system utilizing off-site central monitoring. Variables of interest were examined in relation to a composite event rate of death, ICU transfer, or increased oxygen requirement to high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilation, or mechanical ventilation. RESULTS Among 350 patients (age, 64 ± 16 years; 55% male), most (73%) required 3 L/min or less of supplemental oxygen during admission. Telemetry was widely utilized (79%) yet arrhythmias were uncommon (14%) and were predominantly (90%) among patients with abnormal troponin levels or known cardiovascular disease. Ventricular tachycardia was rare (5%), nonsustained, and not associated with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin treatment. Adverse events occurred in 62 patients (18%), including 22 deaths (6%), 48 ICU transfers (14%), and 49 patients with increased oxygen requirement (14%) and were independently associated with elevated C-reactive protein (odds ratio, 1.09 per 1 mg/dL; 95% CI, 1.01-1.18; P = .04) and lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 1.006 per 1U/L; 95% CI, 1.001-1.012; P = .03) in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION Among non-critically ill patients hospitalized within a nonepicenter health care system, overall survival was 94% with the development of more severe illness or death independently associated with higher levels of C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase on admission. Clinical decompensation was largely respiratory-related, while serious cardiac arrhythmias were rare, which suggests that telemetry can be prioritized for high-risk patients.","Nemer, David M; Wilner, Bryan R; Burkle, Alicia; Aguilera, Jose; Adewumi, Joseph; Gillombardo, Carl; Wazni, Oussama; Menon, Venu; Pengel, Shannon; Foxx, Meredith; Petre, Marc; Hamilton, Aaron C; Cantillon, Daniel J",Journal of hospital medicine,https://doi.org/10.12788/jhm.3510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33147132/,470

MATERIALS AND METHODS Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. Ten prospective patients (eight men, two women; mean age, 72.3 years) with rectal adenocarcinoma underwent two repeated volumetric helical perfusion CT studies (four-dimensional adaptive spiral mode, 11.4-cm z-axis coverage) without intervening treatment within 24 hours, with regional blood flow derived by using deconvolution analysis. Two-dimensional and 3D fractal analyses of the rectal tumor were performed, after segmentation from surrounding structures by using thresholding, to derive fractal dimension and fractal abundance. Reproducibility was quantitatively assessed by using Bland-Altman statistics. Two-dimensional and 3D lacunarity plots were also generated, allowing qualitative assessment of reproducibility. Statistical significance was at 5%. RESULTS Mean blood flow was 63.50 mL/min/100 mL ± 8.95 (standard deviation). Good agreement was noted between the repeated studies for fractal dimension; mean difference was -0.024 (95% limits of agreement: -0.212, 0.372) for 2D fractal analysis and -0.024 (95% limits of agreement: -0.307, 0.355) for 3D fractal analysis. Mean difference for fractal abundance was -0.355 (95% limits of agreement: -0.869, 1.579) for 2D fractal analysis and -0.043 (95% limits of agreement: -1.154, 1.239) for 3D fractal analysis. The 95% limits of agreement were narrower for 3D than 2D analysis. Lacunarity plots also visually confirmed close agreement between repeat studies. CONCLUSION Regional blood flow in rectal cancer exhibits fractal properties. Good reproducibility was achieved between repeated studies with 2D and 3D fractal analysis.","Sanghera, Bal; Banerjee, Debasish; Khan, Aftab; Simcock, Ian; Stirling, J James; Glynne-Jones, Rob; Goh, Vicky",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.12111316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22438361/,470

121611,Estimating the real-world usage of mobile apps for mental health: development and application of two novel metrics.,2021-02-01,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Conditions causing recurrent spontaneous episodes of dizziness or vertigo span several medical specialties, making it challenging for clinicians to gain confidence in evaluating and managing the spectrum of episodic vestibular disorders. Patients are often asymptomatic and have normal examinations at the time of evaluation. Thus, diagnosis depends heavily on eliciting key features from the history. Overreliance on symptom quality descriptions commonly leads to misdiagnosis. The goal of this article is to provide the reader with a straightforward approach to the diagnosis and management of conditions that cause episodic spontaneous dizziness. RECENT FINDINGS Consensus diagnostic criteria have been established for vestibular migraine, Ménière disease, vestibular paroxysmia, and hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo. Vertigo has been recognized as a common symptom in vertebrobasilar ischemia, cardiogenic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension. Treatment recommendations for vestibular migraine still lack high-quality evidence, but controlled trials are occurring. SUMMARY The evaluation should start with a detailed description of the episodes from the patient and any observers. Rather than focusing first on whether the symptom quality is most consistent with vertigo, dizziness, lightheadedness, or unsteadiness, the clinician should clarify the timing (episode frequency and duration), possible triggers or circumstances (eg, position changes, upright posture), and accompanying symptoms. History should identify any auditory symptoms, migraine features, posterior circulation ischemic symptoms, vascular risk factors, clues for anxiety, and potentially relevant medications. Carefully selected testing can help secure the diagnosis, but excessive and indiscriminate testing can lead to more confusion. Treatments for these conditions are vastly different, so an accurate diagnosis is critical.","Eggers, Scott D Z",Continuum,https://doi.org/10.1212/con.0000000000000931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351111/,470

Since juvenile onset of SpA (JSpA) is not well codified by the current juvenile idiopathic arthritis classification, studies in this field are restricted to single categories and therefore cannot be exhaustive. This review aims to report recent advances in the treatment of JSpA. AREAS COVERED In order to assess the available therapies for JSpA, the authors have analyzed data obtained from retrospective and prospective studies, case reports, and case series, as well as from controlled trials. EXPERT OPINION Given the challenging classification of JSpA, research in this field has been restricted to single subcategories. Little is known of which patients are more likely to develop axial involvement leading to severe spinal damage. Whether TNF inhibitors are capable to prevent or stop disease progression, once started, is yet to be ascertained with structural damage still a matter for research. Therefore, trials on the efficacy of TNF inhibitors in JSpA are strongly advocated since they may help to elucidate their place as a treatment option.","Marino, Achille; De Souza, Mirian; Giani, Teresa; Cimaz, Rolando",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2020.1796970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726179/,470
122155,Changing attitudes towards teletherapy in Austrian therapists during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-01-11,"OBJECTIVES The COVID-19 pandemic and its related restrictions have affected attendance to and delivery of UK sexual healthcare services (SHS). We surveyed the impact on sexual behaviour of men having sex with men (MSM) to inform future SHS provision. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional, anonymous, web-based survey among HIV-negative MSM at high risk of HIV infection who attended 56 Dean Street, a sexual health and HIV clinic. The survey was conducted over a 7-day period in August 2020. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviour and related mental well-being experienced during lockdown (defined as 23 March-30 June 2020) were extracted. Categorical and non-categorical variables were compared according to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use. RESULTS 814 MSM completed the questionnaire: 75% were PrEP users; 76% reported they have been sexually active, of which 76% reported sex outside their household. 75% reported fewer partners than prior to lockdown. Isolation/loneliness (48%) and anxiety/stress (27%) triggered sexual activity, and 73% had discussed COVID-19 transmission risks with their sexual partners. While 46% reported no change to emotions ordinarily experienced following sex, 20% reported guilt for breaching COVID-19 restrictions. 76% implemented one or more changes to their sexual behaviour, while 58% applied one or more steps to reduce COVID-19 transmission during sex. 36% accessed SHS and 30% reported difficulties in accessing testing/treatment. Of those who accessed SHS, 28% reported an STI diagnosis. PrEP users reported higher partner number, engagement in 'chemsex' and use of SHS than non-PrEP users. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 restrictions had a considerable impact on sexual behaviour and mental well-being in our survey respondents. High rates of sexual activity and STI diagnoses were reported during lockdown. Changes to SHS provision for MSM must respond to high rates of psychological and STI-related morbidity and the challenges faced by this population in accessing services.","Hyndman, Iain; Nugent, Diarmuid; Whitlock, Gary George; McOwan, Alan; Girometti, Nicolò",Sexually transmitted infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2020-054768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33462118/,470
122169,What will the long-lasting effect of the COVID-19 pandemic be on children's health and wellbeing?,2020-09-01,"OBJECTIVES The COVID-19 pandemic reduced access to gambling and contributed to widespread psychological distress. Psychological distress is a known risk factor for problem gambling as it can motivate excessive gambling as a coping response. The availability of gambling is considered a factor in maintaining problems. This paper aimed to investigate the impact of the shutdown of gambling venues on Australians, particularly among those vulnerable to mental health problems and gambling disorder. METHODS Australian adults who had gambled at least once in the past 12 months (N = 764, 85.2% male) completed an online cross-sectional survey. Self-report measures retrospectively assessed typical monthly gambling frequency and expenditure before and after the COVID-19 venue shutdown, problem gambling, and psychological distress. RESULTS Significant median decreases in gambling frequency were observed, both online and overall. No relationship was found between psychological distress and baseline or increases in gambling. Greater problem gambling severity was related to higher baseline gambling, but not to increases in gambling. Exploratory analysis showed that individuals engaged in moderate-risk gambling, but not problem gambling, were more likely to report increased gambling frequency compared to nonproblem and low-risk gamblers combined. CONCLUSIONS Findings provide important insights into how changes in availability influence gambling participation, and for understanding the effectiveness of forced restrictions and venue exclusion strategies. Most people moderated their gambling when venue-based gambling was unavailable and opportunities for sports betting were limited. However, harms experienced by individuals with some gambling problems may have been exacerbated during the period of limited access. Policies to enhance prevention and treatment of gambling problems are necessary even when availability is reduced.","Gainsbury, Sally M; Swanton, Thomas B; Burgess, Martin T; Blaszczynski, Alex",Journal of addiction medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000793; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323696/,470

Totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy (TLTG) for advanced gastric cancer (AGC) remains controversial because of its technical difficulties and lack of long-term results. We determined the feasibility and safety of TLTG for AGC. METHODS A single-institution retrospective study was conducted. Ninety-two consecutive AGC patients who underwent radical TLTG were enrolled. The primary end point was morbidity. The patients were observed for 3 years following TLTG. We assessed short-term surgical and long-term outcomes, including 3-year overall survival rates (3yOS) and 3-year recurrence-free survival rates (3yRFS). RESULTS Early and late morbidities (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3) were 26.1 and 6.5 %, respectively. Operative time, estimated blood loss, number of dissected lymph nodes, and postoperative hospital stay were 444 (278-694) min, 100 (0-2267) g, 48 (16-89), and 23 (9-136) days, respectively, and 3yOS and 3yRFS rates were 70.7 and 60.9 %, respectively. Factors associated with postoperative complications and 3yOS were operative time [OR 1.011 (1.006-1.017), p < 0.01] and cancer recurrence within 3 years [HR 312.191 (1.126-86573.245], p = 0.045], respectively. 3yRFS was associated with tumor size (≥50 mm) [HR 10.325 (1.328-80.289), p = 0.026], pathological N factor ≥2 [HR 3.188 (1.196-8.495), p = 0.02], and postoperative pancreatic fistula combined with intra-abdominal abscesses Clavien-Dindo grade ≥2; [HR 3.670 (1.440-9.351), p = 0.006].

123864,The Perfect Storm: Hidden Risk of Child Maltreatment During the Covid-19 Pandemic.,2020-12-23,"BACKGROUND The role of laparoscopy in the management of diverticular disease is evolving. Concerns were raised in the past because laparoscopic resection for diverticulitis is often difficult and occasionally hazardous. This study was undertaken to evaluate the difference in overall outcomes between elective open and laparoscopic surgery with or without anastomosis for diverticulitis. METHODS Using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, clinical data of patients who underwent elective open and laparoscopic surgery (lap) for diverticulitis from 2002 to 2007 were collected and analyzed. Patients who underwent emergent surgery were excluded. RESULTS A total of 124,734 patients underwent elective surgery for diverticulitis: open, 110,172 (88.3%); lap, 14,562 (11.7%). The overall intraoperative complication rate was significantly lower in the laparoscopy group (0.63% vs. 1.15%, P < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference observed in ureteral injury between groups (open, 0.17%; lap, 0.12%, P = 0.15). All evaluated postoperative complications (ileus, abdominal abscess, leak, wound infection, bowel obstruction, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, respiratory failure, venous thromboembolism) were significantly higher for the open procedures. The laparoscopy group had a shorter mean hospital stay (lap, 5.06 days; open, 6.68 days, P < 0.01) and lower total hospital charges (lap, $36,389; open, $39,406, P < 0.01) than the open group. Also, mortality was four times higher in the open group (open, 0.54%; lap, 0.13%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic operation was associated with lower morbidity, lower mortality, shorter hospital stay, and lower hospital charges compared to the open operation for diverticulitis. Elective laparoscopic surgery for diverticulitis is safe and can be considered the preferred operative option.","Masoomi, Hossein; Buchberg, Brian; Nguyen, Brian; Tung, Vicrumdeep; Stamos, Michael J; Mills, Steven",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-011-1117-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21732208/,470

We examined associations of COVID-19 information sources and information overload with psychological distress symptoms and explored the mediating effect of information overload in Hong Kong. A random sample of Chinese adults (N = 1501; 52.6% females; 55.0% aged 30-59) from dual landline and online surveys in April 2020 reported frequency of using traditional media, internet websites, social networking sites, instant messaging, and online discussion forums as COVID-19 information sources. Psychological distress symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire 4-item ([PHQ-4]; 0-12). Information overload defined as a perception of being overwhelmed was measured (1-6). Linear regressions were performed to analyze the associations, and the mediating effect of information overload was examined. Greater PHQ-4 score was observed for frequent use of internet websites (adjusted b = 0.58, 95% CI 0.29, 0.87, adjusted β = 0.12) and online discussion forums (adjusted b = 0.39, 95% CI 0.08, 0.70, adjusted β = 0.08) and information overload (adjusted b = 0.54, 95% CI 0.44, 0.63, adjusted β = 0.28). Information overload mediated 44.9% and 36.9% of associations of frequent use of internet websites and online discussion forums with PHQ-4 score, respectively. Frequent use of social networking sites was associated with lower PHQ-4 score (adjusted b = -0.37, 95% CI -0.69, -0.04, adjusted β = -0.07) partially through lower information overload (37.5%).

METHODS A qualitative study using phone interviews, guided by the framework of vulnerability analysis for sustainability, was used to explore HF self-care among older adults in central Texas during the late spring of 2020. Qualitative data were analyzed using directed content analysis. RESULTS Seventeen older adults with HF participated (mean [SD] age, 68 [9.1] years; 62% female, 68% White, 40% below poverty line, 35% from rural areas). Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on the HF self-care behavior of physical activity. Themes of social isolation, financial concerns, and disruptions in access to medications and food indicated exposure, and rural residence and source of income increased sensitivity, whereas adaptations by healthcare system, health-promoting activities, socializing via technology, and spiritual connections increased resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The study's findings have implications for identifying vulnerabilities in sustaining HF self-care by older adults and empowering older adults with coping strategies to improve overall satisfaction with care and quality of life.","Radhakrishnan, Kavita; Allen, Catherine; DeMain, Atami Sagna; Park, Linda",The Journal of cardiovascular nursing,https://doi.org/10.1097/jcn.0000000000000794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33591060/,470
129290,Future perspectives of robot psychiatry: can communication robots assist psychiatric evaluation in the COVID-19 pandemic era?,2021-02-04,"Climate change is the variability of the climate system that includes the atmosphere, the biogeochemical cycles (Carbon cycle, Nitrogen cycle and Hydrological cycle), the land surface, ice and the biotic and abiotic components of the planet earth. Significant impact of climate change is seen in the form of rise in temperature called as global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) mainly responsible for the global warming and climate change. These GHGs have drawn lot of attention due to their significant role in the global warming potential. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested to stop global warming at 1.5oC above preindustrial levels as warming beyond this level might lead to heat extremes, alter insect and plant phenology (Phenological shifts) and more occurrence of vector borne diseases. Climate change is the topic of interest in all fields of life starting from social science and going to the applied science. Global climate cycles and world food production systems are under threat due to the recent climate extreme events. These events include heat waves and change in the rainfall patterns. Thus, risk reduction intervention in the form of mitigation and adaptation is required to minimize the impacts of climate change. Mitigation option includes understanding the present and future components of the climate system and interaction among them through coupled modeling system i.e. Global Circulation Model (GCM). Finally, global issue of climate change could be addressed by taking worldwide cooperation and action and adopting sustainable measures like use of alternative energy sources. The visible benefit on recovery of climate has been seen recently through global lockdown against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Ahmed, Mukhtar",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32464389/,470

DESIGN Living systematic review with network meta-analysis (NMA). DATA SOURCES Sensitive search in seven databases, three grey literature resources and four trial registers. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials evaluating any treatment for PFP with outcomes 'any improvement', and pain intensity. DATA EXTRACTION Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias with Risk of Bias Tool V.2. We used Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise the strength of the evidence. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE 'Any improvement' measured with a Global Rating of Change Scale. RESULTS Twenty-two trials (with forty-eight treatment arms) were included, of which approximately 10 (45%) were at high risk of bias for the primary outcome. Most comparisons had a low to very low strength of the evidence. All treatments were better than wait and see for any improvement at 3 months (education (OR 9.6, 95% credible interval (CrI): 2.2 to 48.8); exercise (OR 13.0, 95% CrI: 2.4 to 83.5); education+orthosis (OR 16.5, 95% CrI: 4.9 to 65.8); education+exercise+patellar taping/mobilisations (OR 25.2, 95% CrI: 5.7 to 130.3) and education+exercise+patellar taping/mobilisations+orthosis (OR 38.8, 95% CrI: 7.3 to 236.9)). Education+exercise+patellar taping/mobilisations, with (OR 4.0, 95% CrI: 1.5 to 11.8) or without orthosis (OR 2.6, 95% CrI: 1.7 to 4.2), were superior to education alone. At 12 months, education or education+any combination yielded similar improvement rates. SUMMARY/CONCLUSION Education combined with a physical treatment (exercise, orthoses or patellar taping/mobilisation) is most likely to be effective at 3 months. At 12 months, education appears comparable to education with a physical treatment. There was insufficient evidence to recommend a specific type of physical treatment over another. All treatments in our NMA were superior to wait and see at 3 months, and we recommend avoiding a wait-and-see approach.

130675,Modifying Risk Factors: Strategies That Work Diabetes Mellitus.,2016,"Manufacture of lead-containing products has long been associated with various health risks. To get an insight into the related genotoxic risks, we conducted a biomonitoring study in 50 exposed workers and 48 matched controls using a battery of endpoints that sensitively detect the extent of genome instability in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The levels of primary DNA damage were estimated with the alkaline comet assay, while cytogenetic abnormalities were determined with the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) cytome assay. Additionally, CBMN slides of 20 exposed and 16 control participants were subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), coupled with pancentromeric probes to establish the incidence of centromere-positive micronuclei, nuclear buds, and nucleoplasmic bridges. Blood lead levels (B-Pb) were measured with atomic absorption spectrometry. To further characterise cumulative effects of occupational exposure, we measured erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) concentrations and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity in blood. We also assessed the influence of serum folate (S-folate) and vitamin B12 (S-B12) on genome stability. Compared to controls, occupationally exposed workers demonstrated significantly higher B-Pb (298.36±162.07 vs 41.58±23.02), MN frequency (18.71±11.06 vs 8.98±7.50), centromere positive MN (C+ MN) (8.15±1.8 vs 3.69±0.47), and centromere negative MN (C- MN) (14.55±1.80 vs 4.56±0.89). Exposed women had significantly higher comet tail intensity (TI) and length (TL) than control women. Furthermore, workers showed a positive correlation between age and nuclear buds and MN, between MN and years of exposure, and between S-B12 levels and TI and ALAD activity, while a negative correlation was found between TI and B-Pb. These findings suggest that occupational settings in the manufacture of lead-containing products pose significant genotoxic risks, which calls for developing more effective work safety programmes, including periodical monitoring of B-Pb and genetic endpoints.","Kašuba, Vilena; Milić, Mirta; Želježić, Davor; Mladinić, Marin; Pizent, Alica; Kljaković-Gašpić, Zorana; Balija, Melita; Jukić, Irena",Arhiv za higijenu rada i toksikologiju,https://doi.org/10.2478/aiht-2020-71-3427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33410779/,470

It provides the opportunity and challenge to improve palliative care training for generalist physicians. Simulation has been recognised internationally as a holistic teaching and assessment method. This study aimed to produce a palliative medicine simulation training package for internal medicine trainees for delivery by palliative medicine trainees providing the former opportunity to practice assessment and management of patients with life-limiting illness and the latter teaching and management opportunities. METHODS A regional group of palliative medicine trainees were trained in simulation and debrief. Nominal and focus group techniques designed a simulation training package. Learning outcomes were mapped to the internal medicine curriculum descriptors. RESULTS Palliative simulation for internal medicine trainees (PALL-SIM-IMT) is a training package meeting internal medicine trainees' curriculum requirements. Regional pilots have demonstrated feasibility for delivery by palliative medicine trainees and improvement in recipients' confidence in all curriculum descriptors. CONCLUSIONS PALL-SIM-IMT can aid competency achievement for the provision of generalist palliative care by internal medicine trainees.

During lockdown, players could only train at home, with limited evidence regarding the effect of this period. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on professional soccer players' physical performance. Aerobic fitness and vertical jump were assessed before and after four periods in two different seasons: COVID-19 lockdown, competitive period before lockdown, competitive period and summer break of the 2016-2017 season. Linear mixed models were used to examine within-period changes and between-period differences in changes observed during COVID-19 lockdown and the three other periods. Within-period changes in aerobic fitness showed a significant improvement following COVID-19 lockdown (p<0.001) and a significant decline during summer break (p<0.001). Between-period differences were significant in the comparison of COVID-19 lockdown with both the competitive 2019-2020 season (p<0.01) and summer break (p<0.001). For the vertical jump, only the between-period comparison revealed significant differences as the changes associated with COVID-19 lockdown were worse than those of the two competitive periods, for both absolute (p<0.05; p<0.001) and relative peak power (p<0.01; p<0.001). Home-based training during lockdown was effective to improve aerobic fitness, although it did not allow players to maintain their competitive period's power levels.","Rampinini, Ermanno; Donghi, Federico; Martin, Marco; Bosio, Andrea; Riggio, Marco; Maffiuletti, Nicola A",International journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1345-9262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33621997/,470

The study aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and anxiety levels of pediatric Hematology/Oncology patients during the COVID19 pandemic and evaluate the association between anxiety levels and physical, emotional, and social aspects of HRQoL. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 292 children between 2.5 - 13 years with chronic hematological/oncological disorders. Pediatric Quality of Life Generic Core Scale and Spence Children's Anxiety Scale were used for assessment of HRQoL and anxiety, respectively. Linear regression was performed to assess the association between background and COVID-19 related factors with anxiety level. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was performed to assess the association between the three HRQoL dimensions with child anxiety and different independent variables. Transfusion-dependent patients had lower anxiety levels than patients receiving chemotherapy (B=-14.45, 95% CI=-21.94,-6.95).Children who were aware of the pandemic had lower anxiety scores than those who were not, while those suffering from canceled clinic days had higher anxiety levels (B=-8.66,95% CI=-14.86,-2.45, and B = 7.33,95% CI =1.22,13.45, respectively). Anxiety significantly reduced the three HRQoL domains (B=-0.36, 95% CI=-0.47, -0.24 for physical functioning, B=-0.45, 95% CI =-0.56, -0.33 for social functioning and B=-0.50, 95% CI=-0.63,-0.38 for emotional functioning).

DESIGN Secondary data analysis using county-level data for 3,142 US counties was conducted in 2020. Hierarchical linear regression and concentration curve analyses were performed. The combined association of COVID-19 cases and deaths was examined separately by the county population's socioeconomic characteristics. Data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates (2014-2018), Area Health Resources File (AHRF) 2018-2019, Kaiser Health News 2020, and 2020 COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University were used in this study. RESULTS After adjusting for covariates, U.S. counties with a higher proportion of the Black population and a higher proportion of adults with less than a high school diploma had disproportionately higher COVID-19 cases and deaths (β > 0, p<0.05 for all relations). A higher proportion of the Hispanic population was associated with higher confirmed cases (β = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.48-0.87). The majority observed disparities in COVID-19 deaths persisted even after controlling for all-cause deaths in 2019 and COVID-19 cases per 100,000 county population. This can potentially aggravate the existing health disparities among these population groups.

Design: A hospital-based case-control study. Setting: This case-control investigation was done in 2011. Usual dietary intakes of participants during the preceding year were examined using a food frequency questionnaire. Data on dietary TAC from foods was gathered from published databases that provided the antioxidant capacity for each food item, measured by ferric reducing antioxidant power. Participants: Cases were individuals with pathologically confirmed glioma that were diagnosed during the last month (n = 128). Controls were individuals, aged between 20 and 75 years, who were hospitalized or were outpatients referred to other wards of the same hospitals (n = 256). Results: Compared with participants in the lowest quartile, those in the highest quartile of dietary TAC had a lower odds of glioma (OR: 0.28, 95%CI: 0.15-0.45). This association was strengthened when potential confounders were taken into account (OR: 0.13; 95%CI: 0.05-0.35). Such inverse association was also seen for men (OR: 0.05, 95%CI: 0.01-0.19), but not for women. Furthermore, significant inverse associations were seen between dietary intakes of vitamin C (OR for Q 4 vs. Q 1: 0.14, 95%CI: 0.05-0.36; P-trend < 0.01), vitamin B6 (OR for Q 4 vs. Q 1: 0.35, 95%CI: 0.13-0.97; P-trend = 0.02) and β-carotene (OR for Q 3 vs. Q 1: 0.43, 95%CI: 0.19-0.98; P-trend = 0.57) and glioma, after controlling for potential covariates. Conclusions: We found that dietary TAC as well as dietary intake of vitamin C, vitamin B6, and β-carotene was inversely associated with odds of glioma in adults.","Heydari, Marzieh; Shayanfar, Mehdi; Sharifi, Giuve; Saneei, Parvane; Sadeghi, Omid; Esmaillzadeh, Ahmad",Nutrition and cancer,https://doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2020.1817954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912000/,470

134232,Longitudinal changes in psychological distress in the UK from 2019 to September 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from a large nationally representative study.,2021-04-02,"BACKGROUND Intravertebral and general anesthesia (GA) are two main anesthesia approaches but both have defects. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of subarachnoid anesthesia combined with propofol target-controlled infusion (TCI) on blood loss and transfusion for total hip arthroplasty (THA) in elderly patients in comparison with combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) or GA. METHODS Totally, 240 patients (aged ≥65 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] I-III) scheduled for posterior THA were enrolled from September 1st, 2017 to March 1st, 2018. All cases were randomly divided into three groups to receive CSEA (group C, n = 80), GA (group G, n = 80), or subarachnoid anesthesia and propofol TCI (group T, n = 80), respectively. Primary outcomes measured were intra-operative blood loss, autologous and allogeneic blood transfusion, mean arterial pressure at different time points, length of stay in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), length of hospital stay, and patient satisfaction degree. Furthermore, post-operative pain scores and complications were also observed. The difference of quantitative index between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, repeated measurement generalized linear model, Student-Newman-Keuls test or rank-sum test, while ratio index was analyzed by Chi-square test or Fisher exact test. RESULTS Basic characteristics were comparable among the three groups. Intra-operative blood loss in group T (331.53 ± 64.33 mL) and group G (308.03 ± 64.90 mL) were significantly less than group C (455.40 ± 120.48 mL, F = 65.80, P < 0.001). Similarly, the autologous transfusion of group T (130.99 ± 30.36 mL) and group G (124.09 ± 24.34 mL) were also markedly less than group C (178.31 ± 48.68 mL, F = 52.99, P < 0.001). The allogenetic blood transfusion of group C (0 [0, 100.00]) was also significantly larger than group T (0) and group G (0) (Z = 2.47, P = 0.047). Except for the baseline, there were significant differences in mean arterial blood pressures before operation (F = 496.84, P < 0.001), 10-min after the beginning of operation (F = 351.43, P < 0.001), 30-min after the beginning of operation (F = 559.89, P < 0.001), 50-min after the beginning of operation (F = 374.74, P < 0.001), and at the end of operation (F = 26.14, P < 0.001) among the three groups. Length of stay in PACU of group T (9.41 ± 1.19 min) was comparable with group C (8.83 ± 1.26 min), and both were significantly shorter than group G (16.55 ± 3.10 min, F = 352.50, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences among the three groups in terms of length of hospitalization and post-operative visual analog scale scores. Patient satisfaction degree of group T (77/80) was significantly higher than group C (66/80, χ = 7.96, P = 0.004) and G (69/80, χ = 5.01, P = 0.025). One patient complained of post-dural puncture headache and two complained of low back pain in group C, while none in group T. Incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting in group G (10/80) was significantly higher than group T (3/80, χ = 4.10, P = 0.043) and group C (2/80, χ = 5.76, P = 0.016). No deep vein thrombosis or delayed post-operative functional exercise was detected. CONCLUSIONS Single subarachnoid anesthesia combined with propofol TCI seems to perform better than CSEA and GA for posterior THA in elderly patients, with less blood loss and peri-operative transfusion, higher patient satisfaction degree and fewer complications.

There is evidence for age and sex variability in symptoms of depression, but despite comorbidity it is unclear whether this extends to anxiety symptomatology. Studies using questionnaire sum scores typically fail to address this phenotypic complexity. METHOD We conducted exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses on Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) items to identify latent factors of anxiety and depression in participants from the Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression Study (N = 35,637; 16-93 years). We assessed age- and sex-related variability in latent factors and individual symptoms using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS Four factors of mood, worry, motor, and somatic symptoms were identified (comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.99, Tucker-Lewis Index [TLI] = 0.99, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.07, standardized root mean square residuals [SRMR] = 0.04). Symptoms of irritability (odds ratio [OR] = 0.81) were most strongly associated with younger age, and sleep change (OR = 1.14) with older age. Males were more likely to report mood and motor symptoms (p < .001) and females to report somatic symptoms (p < .001).

However, pulmonary side effects have only been reported rarely in paediatric cases, despite nitrofurantoin being a first line prophylactic treatment of recurrent childhood urinary tract infection. CASE PRESENTATIONS A 6-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea, general fatigue, loss of appetite and need for nasal oxygen treatment after long-term nitrofurantoin treatment. A computed tomography scan of the chest showed lung fibrosis. A biopsy confirmed this diagnosis. We suspected the fibrosis to be caused by the nitrofurantoin treatment. Thorough examinations reveal no other explanations. Nitrofurantoin was discontinued and the girl was treated with methylprednisolone. After 17 month a new scan and lung function test showed total regression of the lung fibrosis.

Widespread clinical use of prescription opioids for moderate to severe pain contributed to the ongoing opioid epidemic with the subsequent emergence of fentanyl-laced heroin. More potent analogues of fentanyl and structurally diverse opioid receptor agonists such as AH-7921 and MT-45 are fueling an increasingly diverse illicit opioid supply. Overdose from synthetic opioids with high binding affinities may not respond to a typical naloxone dose, thereby rendering autoinjectors less effective, requiring higher antagonist doses or resulting in a confusing clinical picture for health care providers. Nonscheduled opioid drugs such as loperamide and dextromethorphan are associated with dependence and risk of overdose as easier access makes them attractive to opioid users. Despite a common opioid-mediated pathway, several opioids present with unique pharmacodynamic properties leading to acute toxicity and dependence development. Pharmacokinetic considerations involve half-life of the parent opioid and its metabolites as well as resulting toxicity, as is established for tramadol, codeine, and oxycodone. Pharmacokinetic considerations, toxicities, and treatment approaches for notable opioids are reviewed.","Vearrier, David; Grundmann, Oliver",Journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.1923; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34396552/,470

These novel scaffolds were characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to assess the addition of functional groups, presence of AuNPs, and thermal stability of the modified PET mesh, respectively. The biocompatibility of the PET-AuNP scaffolds was evaluated through in vitro cell culture assays. The cellularity of cells exposed to the PET-AuNP scaffolds, as well as the scaffolds' ability to reduce reactive oxygen species, was assessed using L929 murine fibroblasts. Antimicrobial properties of AuNPs conjugated to PET mesh were tested against the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Results from the FT-IR showed presence of COOH groups while SEM displayed bonding of AuNPs to the PET surface. DSC results indicated that the PET more than likely did not undergo any detrimental degradation due to the surface modification. Results from the in vitro studies showed that AuNPs, in optimal concentrations (1× concentrations), enhanced cellularity, reduced ROS, and reduced bacteria adhesion to PET. These studies demonstrated enhanced biocompatibility of the AuNP conjugated PET mesh over pristine PET mesh.","Whelove, Ona E; Cozad, Matthew J; Lee, Byung-Doo; Sengupta, Shramik; Bachman, Sharon L; Ramshaw, Bruce J; Grant, Sheila A","Journal of biomedical materials research.

135807,Lessons from the team care playbook: Recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination dissemination and uptake.,2020-12-17,"Disaster countermeasures have been implemented by the Japanese Society of Neurology based on the experience of support to the areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011. The countermeasures activity began at the end of 2011. We, the Committee for Measures Against Disaster, officially started work in 2014. We developed a support network to urgently deal with patients with intractable neurological disease at the time of disaster and strengthen disaster measures, including effective disaster countermeasure training. During the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, we realized the need to prepare for natural disasters, leading to a state of emergency, at normal times. A list of vulnerable people should be prepared and the individual support plan for disaster should be confirmed during normal times. Furthermore, during disaster, livelihood support is required for patients with intractable neurological disease living in evacuation centers in affected areas. Therefore, we compiled and published the book, titled ""The manual of disaster countermeasures,"" in 2017. The Committee for Measures Against Disaster in the Japanese Society of Neurology has appointed a liaison officer for patients with intractable neurological disease in each prefecture. The liaison's role of is gathering and disseminating information on the disaster-hit areas, arranging medical support, and coordinating health activities, when natural disasters occur. It is hoped that the liaison officer will play an active role both at normal times and during disaster, even unforeseen ones. Although we hope for the best, we aim to be prepared for the worst.","Nakane, Shunya; Mizoguchi, Kouichi; Abe, Koji; Atsuta, Naoki; Iguchi, Yasuyuki; Ikeda, Yoshio; Kaji, Ryuji; Kamei, Satoshi; Kitagawa, Kazuo; Kimura, Kazumi; Suzuki, Masahiko; Takashima, Hiroshi; Terayama, Yasuo; Nishiyama, Kazutoshi; Furuya, Hirokazu; Matsubara, Etsuro; Muramatsu, Shin-Ichi; Yamamura, Osamu; Takeda, Atsushi; Ito, Hidefumi",Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,https://doi.org/10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32814728/,470

136412,Predicting discharge to institutional long-term care following acute hospitalisation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2017,"The majority of infections with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or mild without the necessity of hospitalization. It is of importance to reveal if these patients develop an antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 and to define which antibodies confer virus neutralization. We conducted a comprehensive serological survey of 49 patients with a mild course of disease and quantified neutralizing antibody responses against a clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate employing human cells as targets. Four patients (8%), even though symptomatic, did not develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and two other patients (4%) were positive in only one of the six serological assays employed. For the remaining 88%, antibody response against the S protein correlated with serum neutralization whereas antibodies against the nucleocapsid were poor predictors of virus neutralization. None of the sera enhanced infection of human cells with SARS-CoV-2 at any dilution, arguing against antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in our system. Regarding neutralization, only six patients (12%) could be classified as high neutralizers. Furthermore, sera from several individuals with fairly high antibody levels had only poor neutralizing activity. In addition, employing a novel serological Western blot system to characterize antibody responses against seasonal coronaviruses, we found that antibodies against the seasonal coronavirus 229E might contribute to SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Altogether, we show that there is a wide breadth of antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in patients that differentially correlate with virus neutralization. This highlights the difficulty to define reliable surrogate markers for immunity against SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE There is strong interest in the nature of the neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 in infected individuals. For vaccine development, it is especially important which antibodies confer protection against SARS-CoV-2, if there is a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, and if there is cross-protection by antibodies directed against seasonal coronaviruses. We addressed these questions and found in accordance with other studies that neutralization is mediated mainly by antibodies directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in general and the receptor binding site in particular. In our test system, utilizing human cells for infection experiments, we did not detect ADE. However, using a novel diagnostic test we found that antibodies against the coronavirus 229E might be involved in cross-protection to SARS-CoV-2.","Ruetalo, Natalia; Businger, Ramona; Althaus, Karina; Fink, Simon; Ruoff, Felix; Pogoda, Michaela; Iftner, Angelika; Ganzenmüller, Tina; Hamprecht, Klaus; Flehmig, Bertram; Bakchoul, Tamam; Templin, Markus F; Schindler, Michael",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.01145-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33627511/,470

These events have highlighted inadequacies in both national and international capacity for outbreak prevention, detection, and response. Here, we review some of the major challenges from a policy perspective. RECENT FINDINGS The most important challenges facing policymakers include financing outbreak preparedness and response in a complex political environment with limited resources, coordinating response efforts among a growing and diverse range of national and international actors, accurately assessing national outbreak preparedness, addressing the shortfall in the global biomedical workforce, building surge capacity of both human and material resources, balancing investments in public health and curative services, building capacity for outbreak-related research and development, and reinforcing measures for infection prevention and control. SUMMARY In recent years, numerous epidemics and pandemics have caused not only considerable loss of life but also billions of dollars of economic loss. Although the events have served as a wake-up call and led to the implementation of relevant policies and counter-measures, such as the Global Health Security Agenda, many questions remain and much work to be done. Wise policies and approaches for outbreak control exist, but will require the political will to implement them.","Jain, Vageesh; Duse, Adriano; Bausch, Daniel G",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29846209/,470
140756,Traumatized genitalia in a child: sexual abuse or maybe not?,2021-03-15,"Concern exists about the sustainability of traditional, oncologist-led models of breast cancer survivorship care. However, many oncologists are hesitant about deferring survivorship care to primary care providers (PCPs). Our objective was to examine oncologists' perceptions of the role PCPs play in breast cancer survivorship and the rationale underlying these perceptions. One-on-one interviews with medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists in Wisconsin were conducted (n = 35) and transcribed. Data analysis was performed using an inductive approach to content analysis. Oncologist-perceived barriers included: PCP's level of experience with cancer care; Lack of PCP comfort in providing survivorship care; Existing demands on PCPs' time; Patient preference for oncology-led survivorship care. Oncologists described familiarity and trust in individual PCPs as factors that could mitigate barriers and lead to increased PCP involvement in survivorship care. Although a number of perceived barriers to PCP participation in survivorship were identified by Wisconsin oncologists, our findings support the direction of ongoing initiatives to facilitate PCP involvement. Our findings also suggest that early PCP involvement in survivorship may increase PCP comfort and patients' trust in PCPs in this role. The identified barrier most challenging to address may be the limited capacity of the current primary care system to manage follow-up for breast cancer survivors.","Neuman, Heather B; Jacobs, Elizabeth A; Steffens, Nicole M; Jacobson, Nora; Tevaarwerk, Amye; Wilke, Lee G; Tucholka, Jennifer; Greenberg, Caprice C",Cancer medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.793; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27356781/,470

The prior detection and diagnosis can decrease the occurrence of acute vision loss and enhance efficiency of treatment. Fundus imaging, a non-invasive diagnostic technique, is the most frequently used mode for analyzing retinal abnormalities related to diabetic retinopathy. Computer-aided methods based on retinal fundus images support quick diagnosis, impart an additional perspective during decision-making, and behave as an efficient means to assess response of treatment on retinal abnormalities. However, in order to evaluate computer-aided systems, a benchmark database of clinical retinal fundus images is required. Therefore, a representative database comprising of 2942 clinical retinal fundus images is developed and presented in this work. This clinical database, having varying attributes such as position, dimensions, shapes, and color, is formed to evaluate the generalization capability of computer-aided systems for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. A framework for the development of benchmark retinal fundus images database is also proposed. The developed database comprises of medical image annotations for each image from expert ophthalmologists corresponding to anatomical structures, retinal lesions and stage of diabetic retinopathy. In addition, the substantial performance comparison capability of the proposed database aids in analyzing candidature of different methods, and subsequently its usage in medical practice for real-time applications.","Kaur, Jaskirat; Mittal, Deepti","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

The aim of the study was to compare the size and volume of the ablation zone following RFA on tumors of cirrhotic versus healthy livers. METHODS One hundred and eleven patients who underwent RFA from 2011 to 2013 for the treatment of 140 liver tumors (83 hepatocellular carcinomas developed on a cirrhotic liver, i.e., ""cirrhosis group,"" and 57 tumors developed on a healthy liver, mainly liver metastasis, i.e., ""healthy liver group"") using the same RFA device were retrospectively selected. The diameter and volume of the ablation zone were compared between groups at the end of the procedure (FU0), at first (FU1) and second follow-up (FU2) performed 1.6 months (± 19 days) and 4.7 months (± 40 days) post-RFA, respectively. RESULTS No differences in the size or volume of the ablation zone were found between groups at FU0 (36.5 ± 12 mm vs. 34.3 ± 10 mm, p = 0.5; and 28 ± 16 mm3 vs. 26.5 ± 16 mm3, p = 0.6, respectively), FU1, or FU2. Similarly, no differences were found at FU0, FU1, or FU2 in the subgroups of tumors treated using a single radiofrequency application. The mean volume of the ablation zone decreased over time, by 33.3% at FU1 and 48.5% at FU2, without any difference between groups. CONCLUSION In contradiction to the ""oven effect"" theory, RFA achieves ablation zones of a comparable size and volume in cirrhotic and healthy livers.","Cassinotto, Christophe; Denys, Alban; Gay, Frédérique; Duran, Rafael; Hocquelet, Arnaud; Piron, Lauranne; Guiu, Boris",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-018-1898-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29484466/,470

METHODS A retrospective analysis of our liver surgery database was performed. All patients who underwent liver resection for hepatic carcinoid tumor metastases were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the surgical approach. Patients with concomitant primary and metastatic liver lesions underwent open resection. RESULTS Thirty-six patients underwent resection over a 10-year period (21 open and 15 laparoscopic). Both groups were similar in terms of gender, body mass index, tumor size, incidence of carcinoid syndrome, and extent of resection (P > .05). The laparoscopic group had less mean operative time (2.7 vs 5.4 hours), less mean blood loss (158.3 vs 538.9 mL), and a shorter hospital stay (3.2 vs 7.5 days; P < .05 for all). Complications were similar in both groups (20% vs 33%; P = .21). Two laparoscopic cases required conversion. The 3-year disease-free survival for the laparoscopic group was 73.3% compared to 47.6% for the open group (P = .2). CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this is the first reported study comparing laparoscopic versus open liver resection in the treatment of liver metastases from carcinoid tumors. Our series confirms that selective cases can safely be managed laparoscopically.","Kandil, Emad; Noureldine, Salem I; Koffron, Alan; Yao, Lu; Saggi, Bob; Buell, Joseph F",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2012.08.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23068086/,470

The scale of the problem requires innovative approaches to bring about change. One such approach is the development of a sustainable food system in combination with the leadership of Pacific youth. This study sought to engage Pacific youth as part of the solution to reducing NCDs through social enterprise and championing of sustainable food systems. Four young Fijian vegetable and fruit entrepreneurs shared their stories as part of a participatory action research of Talanoa/storytelling, with social media workshops, networking and promotional opportunities. Findings revealed that youth entrepreneurs are passionate about food and health, family and tradition; some are already food influencers and champions and they are keen to grow their businesses. Yet, there is limited support for small business development with a social purpose and youth-led campaigns. The study indicates a growing potential to develop local youth-led social entrepreneurship and innovation to address NCDs in exciting new ways. There is an urgent need to support innovation interventions to advocate for sustainable food systems for the Pacific, that promote positive human health needs and address, more broadly, climate change effects.","Conn, Cath; Cammock, Radilaite; Sa'u Lilo, Losi; Nayar, Shoba",Health promotion international,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daaa047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830248/,470

Using SARS as an example, we determined the effectiveness of infection control measures (ICMs) by logistic regression and structural equation modelling (SEM), a quantitative methodology that can test a hypothetical model and validates causal relationships among ICMs. Logistic regression showed that installing hand wash stations in the emergency room (p = 0.012, odds ratio = 1.07) was the only ICM significantly associated with the protection of HCWs from acquiring the SARS virus. The structural equation modelling results showed that the most important contributing factor (highest proportion of effectiveness) was installation of a fever screening station outside the emergency department (51%). Other measures included traffic control in the emergency department (19%), availability of an outbreak standard operation protocol (12%), mandatory temperature screening (9%), establishing a hand washing setup at each hospital checkpoint (3%), adding simplified isolation rooms (3%), and a standardized patient transfer protocol (3%). Installation of fever screening stations outside of the hospital and implementing traffic control in the emergency department contributed to 70% of the effectiveness in the prevention of SARS transmission.

OBJECTIVES The study examined concerns, threats, and attitudes relating to care provision during the COVID-19 outbreak among nurses in Israel. DESIGN A 53-item questionnaire was designed for this research, including four open-ended questions. The article used a qualitative research to analyze the responses to the open-ended questions and their association with responses to the close-ended ones. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT In all, 231 registered nurses and fourth-year nursing students throughout the whole country. The questionnaire was delivered in nursing Facebook and WhatsApp groups and through snowball sampling. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The research was pre-approved by the Ethics Committee at the researchers' university. RESULTS Nurses mostly referred to personal risk, followed by dilemmas regarding care provision. On average, 38.6% of quotations stated that during the pandemic, nurses are not asked to perform unfair duties. Nurses discussed activities and requirements that impact their personal and familial safety, their relationship with employer, organization or the state, and their duty to providing care. Other than fear of contraction, respondents' most frequent themes of concerns were related to work condition and patients' interests, inter-collegiate relationships, and uncertainty and worries about the future. Respondents' ethical dilemmas mostly referred to clinical questions, providing care without adequate equipment or managerial support, and in conditions of uncertainty and increased risk. DISCUSSION Nurses raise important issues concerning their relationships with employers and family members, and significant insights regarding the pandemic and their revised responsibilities and definition of work. They raise serious concerns regarding their rights at work and their standing for them.

145325,"COVID-19, guests and crews of cruise: observation on Thai citizens.",2020,"BACKGROUND There has been an identified need for greater patient and family member involvement in healthcare. This is particularly relevant in an intensive care unit (ICU), as the family provides a key communicative and practical link between patient and clinician. Family members have been deemed a positive beneficial influence on ICU care and recovery processes, yet they themselves are often emotionally affected after discharge. There has been no standardised evidenced-based approach which explores research on family member involvement and the range and quality of contributions remain unclear. This project will undertake a systematic review to assess the evidence base for interventions designed to promote patient and family member involvement in adult intensive care settings and develop a comprehensive typology of interventions for use by clinicians, patients and carers. METHODS The following databases will be searched without date restriction: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, as well as the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Joanna Briggs and Cochrane Libraries. Manual searches of recent back issues of leading ICU and patient experience journals will also be undertaken, as will the reference lists of included studies. Unpublished literature will be sought through grey literature databases, including GreyLit and OpenGrey. All evaluation studies that consider intervention activities to promote patient and family member involvement in adult ICUs will be included; all research designs will be eligible. We will seek to include studies that report on a mixture of relevant outcomes for patients and family members. Abstracts and papers will be independently screened by at least two members of the team to determine their inclusion. Included papers will be assessed for methodological rigour using a standard rating approach, which assesses 'quality of study' and 'quality of information'. Quality assessment will be completed by at least two members of the team. Data on interventions, evaluation methods and outcomes will be collated using a predetermined extraction table. These are likely to be heterogeneous in nature, which will mean that the review will follow a narrative approach to synthesis. DISCUSSION The review will provide valuable and rigorous insight into the range and quality of interventions available to promote patient and family member involvement in ICU. This is the first step towards addressing the absence of a synthesis of research for this context, and will, in addition, develop a typology of available interventions that will help service users and clinicians make informed decisions about the approaches to patient and family member involvement which they might want to adopt.

146615,The PAX Good Behavior Game: One Model for Evolving a More Nurturing Society.,2020-08-25,"PURPOSE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel retrograde transvenous embolization technique of peripheral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) using Onyx. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent transvenous retrograde Onyx embolization of peripheral AVMs with dominant venous outflow over a 29-month period. The embolization is aimed at retrograde filling of the nidus after building a solid plug in the dominant venous outflow (push-through). Classification, clinical signs, technical aspects, clinical and technical success rates, and complications were recorded. Short-term outcome was assessed. RESULTS 11 Symptomatic patients (8 female; mean age 31.4 years) were treated at our Vascular Anomalies Center with this method between January 2012 and May 2014. The AVMs were located on the upper extremity (n = 3), pelvis (n = 2), buttock (n = 2), and lower extremity (n = 4). Retrograde embolization was successfully carried out after preparatory transarterial-flow reduction in eight cases (73 %) and venous-flow reduction with Amplatzer Vascular Plugs in four cases (36 %). Complete devascularization (n = 10; 91 %) or 95 % devascularization (n = 1; 9 %) led to complete resolution (n = 8; 73 %) or improvement of clinical symptoms (n = 3; 27 %). One minor complication occurred (pain and swelling). During a mean follow-up time of 8 months, one clinically asymptomatic recurrence of AVM was detected. CONCLUSION Initial results suggest that retrograde transvenous Onyx embolization of peripheral AVMs with dominant venous outflow is a safe and effective novel technique with a low complication rate.","Wohlgemuth, Walter A; Müller-Wille, René; Teusch, Veronika I; Dudeck, Oliver; Cahill, Anne M; Alomari, Ahmad I; Uller, Wibke",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-015-1063-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762488/,470
146912,The COVID-19 Pandemic and the Relevance of Ayurveda's Whole Systems Approach to Health and Disease Management.,2020-10-27,"INTRODUCTION COVID-19 is a viral respiratory disease, which became a global threat to public health. Specific subsets of the population are more vulnerable, namely those with chronic diseases. We aimed to estimate the share of the Portuguese population at the highest risk for complications following COVID-19 infection due to both old age and specific comorbidities. MATERIAL AND METHODS Our sample included all people aged 65 years and above (2215 men and 3486 women) who participated in the fifth Portuguese National Health Interview Survey, conducted in 2014. In order to project the potential population at highest risk for COVID-19, we used the latest available official demographic estimates from the National Institute of Statistics - INE 2018. We used a more restrictive definition of risk combining old age criteria and the following chronic conditions as potential risk factors for COVID-19 according to the available literature: hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardio- and cerebrovascular disease. RESULTS We estimated that 15.5% (n = 1 560 667) of the Portuguese population might be at increased risk for complications from COVID-19 because of old age and existing chronic conditions. Such estimates vary across the country (from 1.7% in Azores to 33.7% in Northern Portugal). Northern Portugal not only has the highest prevalence of selected morbidity (72.8%) within mainland Portugal, but also has the largest population at risk for COVID-19 (n = 526 607). This was followed by the Lisbon and Tagus Valley region (n = 408 564) and Central Portugal (n = 388 867). DISCUSSION Our results should encourage authorities to continue protecting those more vulnerable to the pandemic threat, particularly on those areas of the country which are more likely to be further affected. CONCLUSION We projected a considerable number of Portuguese people at the highest risk for severe COVID-19 disease due to both old age and pre-existing chronic conditions. Such estimates vary across the country.","Laires, Pedro A; Nunes, Carla",Acta medica portuguesa,https://doi.org/10.20344/amp.14222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32707029/,470
147260,Health inequalities worsen with the drop in hospital referrals: a response to the article by Rachel Mulholland et al. on the 'Impact of COVID-19 on accident and emergency attendances and planned hospital admissions in Scotland'.,2021-02-11,"INTRODUCTION Currently, polypropylene materials are used widely for the treatment of various urogynecologic disorders. This type of treatment can be complicated, although rarely, with erosions of the polypropylene implants into the bladder or the urethra. There is no established treatment for such complications. We present our experience in transvesical laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (T-LESS) removal of eroded materials, and a review of the literature in this field. MATERIALS AND METHODS From June 2015 to May 2017 eight females, with an average age of 66.5 years (range 55-80 years), were referred to our Center because of the erosion of polypropylene material in the bladder, after anti-incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse treatment. Patients were diagnosed with ultrasound and cystoscopy. Seven bladder erosions and one bladder and urethral penetration were found. Patients were qualified for removal with the T-LESS approach. The Tri-Port + disposable set and standard laparoscopic instruments were used. The eroded materials were dissected and cut away, and the defects of the bladder wall were closed with barbed sutures. The peri-operative efficacy and safety of the method were assessed, and the patients were scheduled for follow-up visits at 6 weeks and every 3 months thereafter. The patients were offered a cystoscopic exam during the 7-10 month period after the operation. RESULTS The procedures were completed successfully in all patients. No blood loss or complications were observed. The mean operative time was 54.5 min, and the average hospital stay was 30 h. During a follow-up at 11 months, all patients were cured, except for one who presented urethral erosion. CONCLUSIONS The T-LESS technique for removal of eroded meshes is a safe and effective method. The precise access to the bladder minimizes morbidity, and suturing the bladder wall defects may reduce the risk of recurrence.","Przudzik, Maciej; Borowik, Michał; Łesiów, Mirosław; Łesiów, Roman",International urology and nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11255-018-2039-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30478813/,470
147301,"Where We've Been and May Go, Standing on the Shoulders of Giants.",2020-10-28,"Objective. To implement a learner-led, discussion-based course aimed at exposing second-year pharmacy learners to the study of emerging infectious diseases from a global health perspective and to assess the role and importance of pharmacists in the management of disease outbreaks. Design. Learners examined literature pertinent to an emerging infectious disease in a 3-credit, discussion-based course and participated in peer discussion led by a designated learner. Instructional materials included journal articles, audio-visual presentations, documentaries, book chapters, movies, newspaper/magazine articles, and other materials. Learning outcomes were measured based on the ability of learners to perform critical thinking and analysis, communicate with their peers, and participate in class discussions. Assessment. The course was offered to 2 consecutive cohorts consisting of 14 and 16 learners, respectively. Overall, every learner in the first cohort achieved a final grade of A for the course. In the second cohort, the overall grade distribution consisted of grades of A, B, and C for the course. Learner evaluations indicated that the active-learning, discussion-based environment significantly enhanced interest in the topic and overall performance in the course. Conclusion. The elective course on emerging infectious diseases provided in-depth exposure to disease topics normally not encountered in the pharmacy curriculum. Learners found the material and format valuable, and the course enhanced their appreciation of infectious diseases, research methodology, critical thinking and analysis, and their roles as pharmacists.","Mathias, Clinton",American journal of pharmaceutical education,https://doi.org/10.5688/ajpe79681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26430268/,470

Though research has been conducted involving burnout among doctors in China, few studies have focused on residents during standardized residency training (SRT). The professional status of the residents during SRT remains largely unclear. The present study was conducted in order to clarify the prevalence and potential risk factors of burnout in residents during SRT.An electronic questionnaire comprised 2 parts. The first part was designed to collect some basic characteristic information. Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey was included in the second part.As many as 71.05% residents had at least 1 scale of burnout. Emotional exhaustion (EE) was found in 55.6% residents, depersonalization (DP) in 29.7% and reduced personal accomplishment (RPA) in 41.6%. Being older than 27, senior SRT year, working time more than 60 hours per week and poor sleeping quality was independently associated with at least on scale of burnout. Being unable to receive timely supervisor support significantly increased the probability of DP and EE. Not having friends at work or feeling cared for by the hospital were independently related to all 3 symptoms of burnout as well as overall burnout.Burnout rate is high in residents under SRT from middle part of China. Organizational, professional, and social support was demonstrated critical by the potential roles in protecting against burnout. Residents with burnout were prone to considering turnover. Strategies for managing burnout related factors among residents should be focused in future studies.","Geng, Hongfang; Tan, Fang; Deng, Yingqing; Lai, Lifei; Zhang, Jiaqiang; Wu, Zhenlong; Liu, Peibin; Zhu, Qianqian",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629681/,470

Results from the Brazilian National Health Survey.,2020-11-03,"Medical school should teach and reward kindness more, nurturing our thoughts, and collating our kind acts. Through a reflection of my experiences with those working in health inclusion, I contend that our medical education should better prioritise a depth of understanding of another's feelings and needs. Recognising medical education as a powerful and formative experience for all of those involved, I emphasise the necessity of nurturing epistemic systems that allow kindness to flourish. Ultimately, I argue that we need to be helped to think more deeply about another, to better understand suffering and injustice, and how to best remedy them with due conscientiousness. Our education and practice must extend beyond simply discussing the social determinants of health and structural violence to become a questioning of the very moral and epistemic systems which propagate suffering.","Hayes, Alexander",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2020.1781073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32608306/,470

They provide graphical summaries of the data, while text explains the message and context. However, synthesizing information across text and charts is difficult; it requires readers to frequently shift their attention. We investigated ways to support the tight coupling of text and charts in data documents. To understand their interplay, we analyzed the design space of chart-text references through news articles and scientific papers. Informed by the analysis, we developed a mixed-initiative interface enabling users to construct interactive references between text and charts. It leverages natural language processing to automatically suggest references as well as allows users to manually construct other references effortlessly. A user study complemented with algorithmic evaluation of the system suggests that the interface provides an effective way to compose interactive data documents.","Latif, Shahid; Zhou, Zheng; Kim, Yoon; Beck, Fabian; Kim, Nam Wook",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2021.3114802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34587042/,470

We investigated the seroprevalence among HCW in Massachusetts (a region suffering high COVID-19 mortality) at the end of first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. All HCW at Cambridge Health Alliance were invited to participate in this cross-sectional survey in June 2020. Those who volunteered, consented and provided a blood sample were included. Dried blood specimens from finger-prick sampling collected either at home by each HCW or onsite by the study team were analyzed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG to the virus' receptor binding domain, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IgM and IgG antibody abundance were categorized based on the number of standard deviations above the cross-reacting levels found in existing, pre-pandemic blood samples previously obtained by the Ragon Institute and analyzed by the Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA). Seroprevalence estimates were made based on 'positive' IgM or IgG using 'low' (>6 SD), 'medium' (>4.5 SD), and 'high' prevalence cutoffs (>3 SD).A total of 433 out of 5,204 eligible HCWs consented and provided samples.

Although knowledge of the nature of the disease is dynamic, with dozens of scientific articles being published every day about new features of COVID-19, the typical presentation is that of interstitial pneumonia. Despite the large amount of information that has been developed in recent weeks, it has been estimated that this disease can have up to 72% underdiagnosis, which requires clinical tools that are simple, easily accessible, and increase the detection of cases in a feasible way and that yield information with prognostic value. Given this need, some proposals have emerged to be able to diagnose, monitor and respond to the treatment of patients with COVID-19, such as pulmonary ultrasound (USP). It is worth mentioning that the USP has proven to be an efficient and easily reproducible technique for diagnosing heart failure and pleuro-pulmonary pathologies, especially in critically ill patients. Evidence of the usefulness of USP in COVID-19 is still scarce, although preliminary, it seems to be a sensitive technique whose findings have a high gold standard.

153021,Offline Digital Education for Postregistration Health Professions: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis by the Digital Health Education Collaboration.,2019,"BACKGROUND Many physiological health benefits observed after following a ketogenic diet (KD) can be attributed to the associated weight loss. The KD has become more prominent as a popular health choice, not only in obese/overweight individuals, but also in healthy adults. The study aims to determine the effects of a KD, independent of weight loss, on various aspects of physiological health including: sleep, thyroid function, cognition, and cardio-metabolic health. The study will also aim to determine whether a change in basal metabolic rate may be associated with any changes observed. METHODS Twenty healthy men and women between 18 and 50 years of age will take part in this study. In a randomized controlled, cross-over design, participants will follow two isocaloric diets: a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet (55% CHO, 20% fat, 25% protein) and a KD (15% CHO, 60% fat, 25% protein). Each dietary intervention will last for a minimum of 3 weeks, with a 1-week washout period in between. Before and after each diet, participants will be assessed for sleep quality, cognitive function, thyroid function, and basal metabolic rate. A blood sample will also be taken for the measurement of cardio-metabolic and immune markers. DISCUSSION The present study will help in understanding the potential effects of a KD on aspects of physiological health in healthy adults, without the confounding factor of weight loss. The study aims to fill a significant void in the academic literature with regards to the benefits and/or risks of a KD in a healthy population, but will also explore whether diet-related metabolic changes may be responsible for the changes observed in physiological health.

153168,"Another changing of the guard at OEM, this time during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2020-06-02,"Water scarcity has resulted in extensive wastewater recycling for agricultural irrigation in both Israel and the Palestinian Territories. However, minimal data have been collected regarding perceptions about wastewater recycling between the populations in these two areas. While geographically close and economically linked, these two populations differ in terms of governance, income, and access to technology for wastewater recycling. To address the data gap pertaining to perceptions of wastewater recycling, a survey was administered among a convenience sample of subjects (n = 236) recruited from Eilat, Israel and Bethlehem, West Bank, from May to November 2018. The survey included questions addressing knowledge of water sources, water scarcity, and recycled water; willingness to use recycled water for produce irrigation and household tasks; and demographics. Israeli willingness to use recycled water for various purposes ranged from 8.3% to 55.1%, and more than half of Israeli respondents were willing to serve both raw and cooked produce irrigated with recycled water. Willingness to use recycled water ranged from 28.9% to 41.7% among the Palestinian respondents, and Palestinian respondents were more willing to engage in high-contact uses (i.e. drinking and cooking) than Israeli respondents. Among the Israeli respondents, experience or familiarity with wastewater recycling and water contamination were frequently significantly associated with willingness to use recycled water. In contrast, among Palestinian respondents, personal water contamination experience, home water safety testing, and trust in authorities to monitor recycled wastewater reuse were frequently significantly associated with willingness to use recycled water. Given the likely increasing water stress in both Israel and the Palestinian Territories, as well as the continued evolution of wastewater treatment technologies and the substantial amount of agricultural trade ongoing between Israel and the Palestinian Territories, it is important to identify effective and appropriate outreach and communication strategies to enable successful and acceptable water recycling.","Craddock, Hillary A; Rjoub, Younes; Jones, Kristal; Lipchin, Clive; Sapkota, Amy R",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351302/,470

The study purpose was to evaluate validity evidence for performance measures on an EA/TEF simulator. METHODS IRB-exempt data were collected from 12 self-reported ""novice"" and 8 ""experienced"" pediatric surgeons. Participants evaluated the EA/TEF repair simulator using survey ratings that were analyzed for test content validity evidence. Additionally, deidentified operative performances were videotaped and independently rated by two surgeons using the Objective Structured Assessment for Technical Skills (OSATS) instrument. Novice and experienced OSATS were compared with p<.05 significant. RESULTS Participants had high overall simulator ratings. Internal structure was supported by high interitem consistency (α=.95 and .96) and interrater agreement (ICC) [.52, .84] for OSATS ratings. Experienced surgeons performed at a significantly higher level than novices for all five primary and two supplemental OSATS items (p<.05). CONCLUSION Favorable participant ratings indicate the simulator is relevant to clinical practice and valuable as a learning tool. Further, performance ratings can discriminate experienced and novice performances of EA/TEF repair.

In this Personal View, I set out an economic theory that emphasises some of the ways in which neoliberal capitalism's conceptualisation of value has mediated responses to COVID-19. Using the intersection of ecological, feminist, and Marxist economics, I develop an analysis of neoliberal capitalism as a specific historical form of the economy. I identify the accumulation of exchange value as a central tendency of neoliberal capitalism and argue that this tendency creates barriers to the production of other forms of value. I then analyse the implications of this tendency in the context of responses to COVID-19. I argue that resources and labour flow to the production of exchange value, at the expense of production of other value forms. Consequently, the global capitalist economy has unprecedented productive capacity but uses little of this capacity to create the conditions that improve and maintain people's health. To be more resilient to coming crises, academics, policy makers, and activists should do theoretical work that enables global economies to recognise multiple forms of value and political work that embeds these theories in societal institutions.","Mair, Simon",The Lancet.

Only relevant, human studies of all types were included from the last decade. A total of 36 articles were selected for review. Observational studies indicate a correlation between low serum 25(OH)D levels and obstructive lung disease pathology as well as clinical outcomes. Moreover, clinical trials were aimed to understand the impact of the use of vitamin D in improving disease indexes. These clinical trials used different drug regimes, mode of administration, and intervention duration with contrasting outcomes. Hypovitaminosis D is a common and harmful variant of this group of obstructive lung diseases, and correcting this deficiency can improve exacerbations, inflammation, lung functions, symptoms, and quality of life. These benefits are more prevalent in patients with low baseline serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D(25(OH)D) levels. Peroral is the most frequently used route of drug administration, however, further work is required to explore the pharmacological properties of vitamin D. There was not enough literature available about the safety of the drug of intervention.","Saleem, Amber; Sharif, Shayka; Jarvis, Sommer; Madouros, Nikolaos; Koumadoraki, Evgenia; Khan, Safeera",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33728117/,470

We hypothesised that restoration of regional cerebral oxygen desaturation would reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients after cardiac surgery. After institutional ethics review board approval and informed consent, a double-blinded, prospective, randomised, controlled trial was conducted in patients ≥ 60 years of age undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. In the intervention group, an algorithm was commenced if regional cerebral oxygen saturation decreased below 75% of baseline value for 1 min or longer. In the control group, the cerebral oximetry monitor screen was electronically blinded. Assessment of delirium was performed with confusion assessment method for intensive care unit or confusion assessment method after discharge from intensive care unit at 12-h intervals for seven postoperative days. Postoperative delirium was present in 30 out of 123 (24.4%) and 31 out of 126 (24.6%) patients in the intervention and control groups, respectively, odds ratio 0.98 (95%CI 0.55-1.76), p = 0.97. Postoperative delirium was present in 20 (71%) out of 28 and in 41 (18%) out of 221 patients with baseline regional cerebral oxygen saturation ≤ 50, or > 50%, respectively, p = 0.0001. Higher baseline regional cerebral oxygen saturation and body mass index were protective against postoperative delirium. Restoration of regional cerebral oxygen desaturation did not result in lower postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery. Pre-operative regional cerebral oxygen saturation ≤ 50% was associated with increased postoperative delirium rates in elderly patients following cardiac surgery.","Lei, L; Katznelson, R; Fedorko, L; Carroll, J; Poonawala, H; Machina, M; Styra, R; Rao, V; Djaiani, G",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.14056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28940368/,470
155755,Efficacy of forced-air warming and warmed intravenous fluid for prevention of hypothermia and shivering during caesarean delivery under spinal anaesthesia: A randomised controlled trial.,2019,"Outcomes for young people diagnosed with osteosarcoma hinge almost exclusively on whether they develop lung metastasis. The striking predilection that osteosarcoma shows for metastatic spread to lung suggests properties and/or lung interactions that generate tissue-specific survival and proliferation advantages. While these mechanisms remain overall poorly defined, studies have begun to describe biological elements important to metastasis. Mechanisms described to date include both cell-autonomous adaptations that allow disseminated tumor cells to survive the stressors imposed by metastasis and intercellular signaling networks that tumor cells exploit to pirate needed signals from surrounding tissues or to recruit other cells that create a more favorable niche. Evidence suggests that cell-autonomous changes are largely driven by epigenetic reprogramming of disseminated tumor cells that facilitates resistance to late apoptosis, manages endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressors, promotes translation of complex transcripts, and activates clotting pathways. Tumor-host signaling pathways important for lung colonization drive interactions with lung epithelium, mesenchymal stem cells, and mediators of innate and adaptive immunity. In this chapter, we highlight one particular pathway that integrates cell-autonomous adaptations with lung-specific tumor-host interactions. In this mechanism, aberrant ΔNp63 expression primes tumor cells to produce IL6 and CXCL8 upon interaction with lung epithelial cells. This tumor-derived IL6 and CXCL8 then initiates autocrine, osteosarcoma-lung paracrine, and osteosarcoma-immune paracrine interactions that facilitate metastasis. Importantly, many of these pathways appear targetable with clinically feasible therapeutics. Ongoing work to better understand metastasis is driving efforts to improve outcomes by targeting the most devastating complication of this disease.","Reinecke, James Brandon; Roberts, Ryan David",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-43085-6_7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767237/,470

OBJECTIVE To create a registry of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain, in order to improve our knowledge of the clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic aspects of this disease. METHODS A multicentre retrospective cohort study, including consecutive patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 throughout Spain. Epidemiological and clinical data, additional tests at admission and at seven days, treatments administered, and progress at 30 days of hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records. RESULTS Up to June 30th 2020, 15,111 patients from 150 hospitals were included. Their median age was 69.4 years (range: 18-102 years) and 57.2% were male. Prevalences of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus were 50.9%, 39.7%, and 19.4%, respectively. The most frequent symptoms were fever (84.2%) and cough (73.5%). High values of ferritin (73.5%), lactate dehydrogenase (73.9%), and D-dimer (63.8%), as well as lymphopenia (52.8%), were frequent. The most used antiviral drugs were hydroxychloroquine (85.6%) and lopinavir/ritonavir (61.4%); 33.1% developed respiratory distress. Overall mortality rate was 21.0%, with a marked increase with age (50-59 years: 4.7%, 60-69 years: 10.5%, 70-79 years: 26.9%, ≥80 years: 46.0%). CONCLUSIONS The SEMI-COVID-19 Network provides data on the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain. Patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain are mostly severe cases, as one in three patients developed respiratory distress and one in five patients died. These findings confirm a close relationship between advanced age and mortality.","Casas-Rojo, J M; Antón-Santos, J M; Millán-Núñez-Cortés, J; Lumbreras-Bermejo, C; Ramos-Rincón, J M; Roy-Vallejo, E; Artero-Mora, A; Arnalich-Fernández, F; García-Bruñén, J M; Vargas-Núñez, J A; Freire-Castro, S J; Manzano-Espinosa, L; Perales-Fraile, I; Crestelo-Viéitez, A; Puchades-Gimeno, F; Rodilla-Sala, E; Solís-Marquínez, M N; Bonet-Tur, D; Fidalgo-Moreno, M P; Fonseca-Aizpuru, E M; Carrasco-Sánchez, F J; Rabadán-Pejenaute, E; Rubio-Rivas, M; Torres-Peña, J D; Gómez-Huelgas, R",Revista clinica espanola,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rce.2020.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32762922/,470

159903,LIMEs and LEMONs: Critically Examining the Effect of a Blog Post on Junior Faculty Learners.,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND Dense Bone Islands (DBIs) are anatomic variants defined as radiopaque lesions consisting of hamartomatous cortical bone, often presenting as incidental radiographic findings. DBIs can also be known as idiopathic osteosclerosis, bone whorl, focal periapical osteopetrosis, bone scar and enostosis. We found a paucity of literature for management and reporting of this condition in children. For this reason, the authors describe sixteen cases of children and adolescents with dense bony islands and suggest a pathway for management. CASE SERIES Cases presented to the RNENT and Eastman Dental Hospital or private practice, either as chance findings or for diagnosis and treatment planning of undiagnosed radiopaque areas. The individuals were aged between 10 and 17 years; 6 boys and 10 girls. All radiographic reports described DBIs. Diagnoses were confirmed by a Dental and Maxillofacial Radiology Consultant and advised no intervention. In some cases, monitoring was advised. Caution in orthodontic tooth movement was advised for five patients. CONCLUSION DBIs are common findings that seldom require treatment; however, caution should be exercised when undertaking orthodontic movement in the area of a DBI due to a potential risk of root resorption. Accurate identification and multidisciplinary management are of utmost importance.","Alfahad, S; Alostad, M; Dunkley, S; Anand, P; Harvey, S; Monteiro, J",European archives of paediatric dentistry : official journal of the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40368-020-00596-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423206/,470
160546,Health Technology to Support the Care of Older Adults: A Collaborative Symposium.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND Public awareness campaigns are conducted to increase stroke awareness, yet evidence of their long-term effectiveness is limited. Since 2006, the Czech Stroke Society has conducted an educational campaign throughout the Czech Republic (CR) to increase awareness about stroke. This report evaluates the effectiveness of this campaign by comparing the results of a nationwide survey on stroke awareness in 2009 with the results from 2005. METHODS In 2009, a nationwide survey was conducted throughout the CR using the same methodology as in 2005 and employing a 3-stage random sampling method (area, household, and household member sampling). Participants >40 years of age were personally interviewed via a structured questionnaire concerning their knowledge and ability to correctly respond to stroke as assessed by the validated Stroke Action Test (STAT). The primary outcome measure was the difference in a STAT score >50% (i.e. respondents chose to call 911 for >50% of stroke symptoms) between 2005 and 2009. Campaign intensity was characterized by a systematic search for media messages about stroke in the CR. RESULTS A total of 601 interviews were obtained (90% response rate) in 2009 (592 people were interviewed in 2005). A STAT score >50% was achieved by 18% of the respondents both in 2005 and 2009 (p = 0.89). There was no increase in the knowledge of risk factors or warning signs between 2005 and 2009. Respondents who noticed the campaign (19%) had better STAT scores than respondents who did not (25 vs. 17%; p = 0.038). A systematic search revealed that the campaign had reasonable intensity because there were 978 media reports about stroke between 2006 and 2008. CONCLUSIONS A medium-intensity educational campaign, based on donated advertising media, failed to increase stroke awareness. However, if the campaign had reached more people, it might have been effective. Therefore, in the future, paid advertising media should accompany free media, although such approach would require a substantially larger budget. Awareness campaigns should be constantly evaluated for their effectiveness to develop more successful strategies.","Mikulík, R; Goldemund, D; Reif, M; Brichta, J; Neumann, J; Jarkovský, J; Krýza, J",Cerebrovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000330339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21921597/,470
160632,Examining the effect of binge eating and disinhibition on compensatory changes in energy balance following exercise among overweight and obese women.,2016,"BACKGROUND Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an established prognostic marker in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Currently, the role of HPV in sinonasal carcinoma is being explored. OBJECTIVES This systematic review addresses the role of HPV in sinonasal cancer, establishing the occurrence of HPV-positive cancers and the influence of HPV-positivity on prognosis in sinonasal cancer as well as the utility of the putative surrogate marker of HPV (p16) in sinonasal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS Studies were identified with searches of Medline via PubMed and Embase via OVID (4 May 2020). Articles on original research concerning sinonasal cancer and HPV in humans written in English were included. Case reports with less than five cases were excluded. RESULTS Initially, 545 articles were identified; 190 duplicate articles were removed leaving 355 articles for title/abstract screening. Title/abstract screening excluded 243 articles, leaving 112 studies assessed for eligibility. After full-text screening, 57 studies were included. All articles investigated the significance of HPV in sinonasal carcinomas. HPV was reported in approximately 30% of sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SNSCC), where it was associated with a better prognosis. In sinonasal cancer, p16 is associated with diagnostic pitfalls and a putative utility of p16 in SNSCC has yet to be established. HPV was not frequently reported in other types of sinonasal carcinomas, besides the recently described subtype, HPV-dependent Multiphenotypic Sinonasal Carcinoma. In other types of sinonasal carcinoma, HPV is not frequently found. CONCLUSION Approximately 30% of SNSCC are HPV-positive. HPV-positivity in SNSCC is associated with improved survival. HPV occurs only rarely in other sinonasal cancers. There is currently not sufficient evidence for p16 as a surrogate marker of HPV in SNSCC.","Sjöstedt, Sannia; von Buchwald, Christian; Agander, Tina Klitmøller; Aanaes, Kasper",Acta oncologica,https://doi.org/10.1080/0284186x.2021.1950922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34319844/,470

METHODS Patients in whom early stasis occurred were compared with those in whom complete delivery was achieved for tumour type and vascularity, tumour : normal liver ratio (T : N ratio) at technetium-99m-macroaggregated albumin (Tc-99m-MAA) angiography, previous intra-arterial therapy, and infusion site (left, right or whole liver). Tumour response was evaluated at 3 months and defined according to whether a partial response and stable disease versus progressive disease were demonstrated. RESULTS A total of 71 patients underwent 128 Y-90 infusions in which 26 (20.3%) stasis events occurred. Hypervascular and hypovascular tumours had similar rates of stasis (17.4% versus 27.8%; P = NS). The mean ± standard deviation T : N ratio was 3.03 ± 1.54 and 3.66 ± 2.79 in patients with and without stasis, respectively (P = NS). Stasis occurred in 14 of 81 (17.3%) and 12 of 47 (25.5%) infusions following previous intra-arterial therapy and in therapy-naïve territories, respectively (P = NS). Early stasis occurred in 15 of 41 (36.6%) left, 10 of 65 (15.4%) right and one of 22 (4.5%) whole liver infusions (P < 0.001). Rates of partial response and stable disease were similar in the stasis (88.3%) and non-stasis (76.0%) groups (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS Early stasis occurred in approximately 20% of infusions with similar incidences in hyper- and hypovascular tumours. Whole-liver therapy reduced the incidence of stasis. Stasis did not appear to affect initial imaging outcomes.","Piana, Peachy Mae; Bar, Voichita; Doyle, Laura; Anne, Rani; Sato, Takami; Eschelman, David J; McCann, Jeffrey W; Gonsalves, Carin F; Brown, Daniel B",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/hpb.12135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23782387/,470

It has already been spread out in most of the countries and a few of which are experiencing second wave. The Novel coronavirus-2019 (SARS CoV-2) incurred more than 1.6 million deaths and 76 million cases in the world population (till 20 December 2020). Although some vaccines are being launched, however, their effectivity and availability are still unknown. Maintaining personal hygiene and social distance are the best way of protection. Hand washing is the utmost recommendation for the maintenance of personal hygiene since hands can be contaminated by the droplets easily. Particularly, in pandemic situations, it is crucial to interrupt the transmission chain of the virus by the practice of proper hand sanitization. The hand sanitization solely depends on the use of effective hand disinfecting agents. Natural formula-based disinfectants can be preferable to chemicals because of higher efficacy and lower adverse effects. Unani medicine is the system based on natural formulations. ""Raihan"" (common sage, Salvia officinalis) is frequently used in Unani medicine for its higher disinfectant role. Common sage extract with ethanol may provide superior efficacy against COVID-19.

However, that is rarely feasible due to the constraints imposed by standardized measures of reading ability which require test administration by trained clinicians or researchers. Here we explore whether a simple, two-alternative forced choice, time limited lexical decision task (LDT), self-delivered through the web-browser, can serve as an accurate and reliable measure of reading ability. We found that performance on the LDT is highly correlated with scores on standardized measures of reading ability such as the Woodcock-Johnson Letter Word Identification test (r = 0.91, disattenuated r = 0.94). Importantly, the LDT reading ability measure is highly reliable (r = 0.97). After optimizing the list of words and pseudowords based on item response theory, we found that a short experiment with 76 trials (2-3 minutes) provides a reliable (r = 0.95) measure of reading ability.

164820,Measuring COVID-19 anxiety among russians: Examining the psychometric properties of russian translations of the covid-anxiety scale and the fear of coronavirus-19 scale,2021,"In the era of the Schengen Area (at least in the days before Covid-19), travel from Munich to Bozen/Bolzano or Ljubljana to Trst/Trieste is a decidedly unremarkable, albeit beautiful, adventure. Just as meaningful as the lack of border controls, travellers find all public signage in both Italian and German (and sometimes Ladin, too) upon arrival in Bozen/Bolzano. Signs in the streets of Trst/Trieste less reliably have Slovene alongside the Italian, but assistance with translation can be found with little difficulty. The Italian autonomous regions ‘with special statutes’ in which these cities reside – Trentino-Alto Adige (South Tyrol) and Friuli Venezia Giulia (the Julian March) – are multilingual territories that, at least on an official level, embrace a multiethnic heritage and reality. In fact, Trentino-Alto Adige's consociational democracy is widely regarded among political scientists as an international role model for how states can successfully protect and give voice to minority populations. Those unfamiliar with the more recent history of these regions might be surprised to learn of these avowedly multiethnic political and cultural structures. For much of the first half of the twentieth century, the regions’ two states – Austria-Hungary until 1919 and thereafter Italy – employed the ‘nationality principle’ to define policies and populations in these territories. As in most of Europe at the time, sovereignty was increasingly predicated on the contemporary ideal of the nation state, in which borders, ethnicity, language and citizenship were all bound together. Of course, as a multiethnic empire, Austria-Hungary was much more concerned about centralising state authority (and then fighting a world war) than national homogeneity, while Italy's nationalisation campaign in the interwar period became fundamental to its presence in the new provinces. Still, both states sought to classify and ultimately to control their border populations by privileging ethnolinguistic categories of citizenship.","McLean, Eden",Contemporary European History,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0960777320000545,470

165895,That’s not my family: The undercover bipolar patient,2021,"The air conditioning (AC) is a key driver to produce electricity consumption, particularly in residential buildings. In Indonesia, the electricity bill during pandemic covid-19 has increased to high level in hot days. This is because during these periods many consumers applied their AC for long time at the same time. It is therefore essential to developed an innovative model to control the electricity peak price and keep comfortable room during hot days. Many previous studies have confirmed that applied evaporative cooling or other technologies can minimize the whole consumption and cost. The aim of this research is to design a pre-cooling model (PM) for AC to avoid high electricity prices at midday during hot days. To achieve this goal a mathematical model was developed to define the energy cost (EC) and total cost (TC) for AC during the hot season.

To justify this model, a PM was applied for two different building characteristics. As a result, the benefits of a PM if spike occurs for 0.5h and 1h was achieved, such as: IDR 10,061 (30.43%) and IDR 10,693 (24.44%) for building-1;IDR 12,071 (37.40%) and IDR 14,844 (34.97%) for building-2. In addition, the TC considering the probability of a spike of 0.5h and 1h if the spike occurs every five minutes were IDR 45,247 and IDR 38,287 for building-1 and building-2, respectively.","Marwan, Marwan Marwan Muhammad Dihyah",Journal of King Saud University - Engineering Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksues.2021.07.004,470

166038,"Physical Activity in Children, Women and the Elderly People: Covid 19 Process",2020,"To this day, epidemics pose a considerable threat to mankind. Experimental models that simulate the spread of infectious diseases are thus crucial to the inception of effective control policies. Current models have had great success incorporating virulence and host immune response but do rarely take host genetics, behavior and host environment into account. Here, we present a full-scale imaging setup that utilizes the infection of the nematode C. elegans with a positive-stranded RNA virus (Orsay Virus) to probe key epidemiological parameters and simulate the spread of infection in a whole population. We demonstrate that our system is able to quantify infection levels and host behavior at a high sampling rate and show that different host genetic backgrounds can influence viral spread, while also highlighting the influence of infection on various host behaviors. Future work will allow the isolation of key behavioral and environmental factors that affect viral spread, potentially enabling novel policies to combat the spread of viral infections. Significance Statement In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we struggle to find effective control policies that “stop the spread”. While current animal models of virus spread in populations are highly sophisticated, they rarely explore effects of host behavior and its environment. We developed an experimental animal model system that allows us to visualize virus transmission in whole populations of C. elegans while also measuring behaviors. We were able to demonstrate how C. elegans genetics influences the progression of viral infection in a population and how animals adjust their behavior when infected. In the future, we envision that animal model systems like ours are used to test the effects of viral control policies on viral spread before they are applied in real world scenarios.","Pirenne, Laurence; Jakobs, Maximilian A.

166339,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Family Carers of Older People Living with Dementia in Italy and Hungary,2021,"PurposeHospitality and tourism researchers are yet to provide evidence of actual crisis management amongst small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), especially from a resource-scarce destination perspective. By adapting a crisis management framework, the authors elected to fill this gap by exploring small and medium-sized hospitality and tourism operators' (SMHTOs) personal experiences of managing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Ghana. The study uncovers their crisis-coping strategies as well as immediate- and long-term post-recovery strategies.Design/methodology/approachUsing a qualitative lens, informed by phenomenology as well as theoretical saturation, data were collected from 20 owner-managers (OMs) and non-owner managers (NOMs) of accommodation, restaurants, travel and tour (T&T) agencies and souvenir shop operators via a combination of telephone and socially distanced face-to-face interviews as well as participant observation. Data were thematically analysed involving both deductive and inductive coding techniques. Data validity and reliability were confirmed using “member check” and inter-rater/coder reliability statistic in SPSS, respectively.FindingsImpacts of the pandemic on businesses included shutdowns, booking cancellations, revenue drops, lay-offs and defaults in the payment of pension contributions and taxes. The pandemic greatly impacted the accommodation, T&T and souvenir shop operators compared to food and beverage (F&B) operators due to the temporary closure of Ghana's borders and major attractions. The study identified six phases in SMHTOs’ crisis management process: awareness, combating the spread of COVID-19, coping mechanisms, short-term/immediate and long-term recovery measures and lessons learned. Besides, state institutions and personal beliefs influenced the coping and recovery actions used by SMHTOs.Practical implicationsIt is critical for governments and industry management institutions to consider the capabilities and specific actions taken by SMHTOs during a crisis such as COVID-19 in the efforts to support their crisis preparedness and response strategies. Furthermore, SME operators in the industry must see insurance uptake as one important measure that could help them cope with the losses instigated by the impact of a crisis and possibly speed up their recovery.Originality/valueThe study extends the general crisis management framework by including additional phases of crisis management and the specific activities carried out by SMHTOs in managing the COVID-19 crisis. This makes this study one of the first studies in Africa that examined crisis-coping and post-recovery strategies amongst small and medium-sized hospitality and tourism firms.","Dayour, Frederick Charles Atanga Adongo Francis Eric Amuquandoh Issahaku Adam",Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Insights,https://doi.org/10.1108/jhti-08-2020-0150,470
166729,Online psychotherapy in times of COVID-19: professional’s experience,2021,"Has the occurrence of & ldquo;extreme capital flow movements & rdquo;& mdash;episodes of sudden surges, stops, flight and retrenchment & mdash;changed since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC)? And was the period at the outset of the Covid Crisis any different? This paper addresses these questions by updating and building on the dataset and methodology introduced in Forbes and Warnock (2012) to calculate the occurrence of sharp capital flow movements by foreigners and domestics into and out of individual countries. The results suggest that the occurrence of these extreme capital flow movements has not increased since the GFC, including during the early phases of the Covid Crisis (the first half of 2020). The drivers of these episodes, however, appear to have changed since the GFC. Extreme capital flow movements are less correlated with changes in global risk and more correlated with changes in oil prices. More generally, what used to be large global & ldquo;waves & rdquo;in international capital flows have more recently become more idiosyncratic & ldquo;ripples & rdquo;. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In 199 residents, mRNA vaccine dose 1 elicited partial spike and receptor binding domain antibody responses, while the second elicited a response at least equivalent to convalescent individuals in most residents. Residents administered mRNA-1273 (Moderna) mounted stronger total and neutralizing antibody responses than those administered BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech). Two to four weeks after dose 2, residents (n = 119, median age 88) produced 4.92-6.5-fold fewer neutralizing antibodies than staff (n = 78; median age 45) against wild-type (with D614G) pseudotyped lentivirus, and residents administered BNT162b2 produced 2.95-fold fewer neutralizing antibodies than those who received mRNA-1273. These effects were exacerbated upon serum challenge with pseudotyped VOC spike, with up to 6.64-fold reductions in B.1.351 (Beta) neutralization. Cumulatively, weaker vaccine stimulation, age/comorbidities, and the VOC produced an ~130-fold reduction in apparent neutralization titers in LTCH residents and 37.9% of BNT162b2-vaccinated residents had undetectable neutralizing antibodies to B.1.351. Continued immune response surveillance and additional vaccine doses may be required in this population with known vulnerabilities.","Abe, K.

The food sector is also susceptible and substantially harmed by the influence of intensive effects of coronavirus. To ensure food safety and limit the spread of coronavirus at food services and retail sector has become a challenge where delicate and fresh food items are served and delivered to the customers, which have passed through a series of operational steps from order taking, food receiving, preparation of food, packing, delivery to customers. At each step, there is a possibility of food handlers to touch the food surface or food directly and if food handler is not following appropriate precautionary measures e.g. hand hygiene, sanitization and disinfection, social distances, and is touching, then it can be a possible source of coronavirus spread. Since there is no evidence that food is a coronavirus transmission route but during the food operations, improper sanitization and disinfection of key touchpoints, food contact, nonfood contact, equipment and cleaning tools surfaces and close contact of food handlers with staff and customers not only can put themselves on risk but can also be a risk for customers. Food services and the retail sector should make sure proper hand hygiene, approved sanitizers and disinfectants in use, follow social distances at workstations and while interacting with the customers.

Several non-specific features of the disease like prolonged incubation period, asymptomatic yet contagious, longer illness duration, and conveyance post clinical recovery feature makes prevention difficult and is the key reason for its rapid spread across the world. Covid-19 shows varied manifestations with the majority of reported cases having mild or even no symptoms. However, the infection led to a destructive footprint in the pulmonary system, specifically, lungs are most prone to damage, making them incapable of conducting respiratory functions and thus, resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ dysfunction, and loss of life. Up to the present, there is no worldwide-approved treatment for COVID-19 and only repurposed drugs are employed for the hospitalized patient, necessitating an urgent need to develop effective therapeutics. Hence, effective control of disease spread through screening and isolation of contacts is crucial in the community.

Background: The novel influenza coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or SARSCoV-2) has upended several aspects of our lives, including medical activities. In this setting, many routine cancer diagnostic and therapeutic procedures have been suspended, leading to delays in diagnosis, treatments, and, ultimately, increases in cancer mortality rates. Equally drastic has been the impact of COVID-19 on clinical trials, many of which have been stalled or have never begun. This has left many patients who were hoping to receive innovative treatments in a limbo. Although, as of today, the introduction of drastic security measures has been crucially important to contain the pandemic, one cannot ignore the need to continue providing chronically ill patients all the health care they need, in terms of detection, prevention, and treatment. In these unprecedented times, liquid biopsy, more than ever before, may play a relevant role in the adequate management of these frail patients. Methods: we performed a deep analysis of the recent international literature published in English on PUBMED in the last six months focused on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the management of lung cancer patients, focusing the attention on the role of liquid biopsy. Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic has significantly modified our lives and overall medical practice.

As a first step, a thorough literature review was undertaken to demonstrate the social, environmental and economic benefits of a circular construction industry. As next step, the guideline for a ‘Circular University Campus’ was developed, and its applicability tested on the case study. As final step, the evolved principles were used to establish ‘Project Specific Circular Building Indicators’ for a student residential block and enhance the proposed design through bioclimatic and regenerative design strategies. The building’s performance was evaluated through computational simulations, whole-life carbon analysis and a circular building assessment tool. The results demonstrated the benefits and feasibility of bioclimatic, regenerative building and neighbourhood design and provided practical prototypical case study and guidelines which can be adapted by architects, planners and governmental institutions to other projects, thereby enabling the shift to a restorative, circular construction industry.","Bakos, Noemi Schiano-Phan Rosa",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158238,470
168885,National Population-Level Disparities in COVID-19 Mortality Across the Intersection of Race/Ethnicity and Sex in the United States,2021-09-05,"Abstract Polymer nanocomposites based on polypropylene (PP) reinforced with carbon nanofibers (CNFs) at a fixed concentration of 0.5% w/w were prepared by precipitation from liquid solutions of PP and CNFs. Ultrasonic processing was used as the primary process for mixing both PP and CNFs in the the solvent, while mechanical stirring was also used as a control process to prepare similar samples. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the ultrasonic processing influences little on the thermal stability of the polymer material. Moreover, ultrasonically-processed PP shows higher tensile strength and better ductility, compared to those of the neat PP. Although the mechanically-processed PP has about 10% higher tensile strength than the ultrasonically-processed one, it is observed that there is a significant deterioration in its ductility due to the dissolution of calcium carbonate which is used as an additive for the neat PP. The advantage of significantly reduced material processing time, increased mixing efficiency, and increase in thermal stability and mechanical properties of ultrasonically-processed PPs indicated that the ultrasonic processing is relatively more effective and efficient mixing process compared to mechanical stirring for preparation of the polymer and its nanocomposite. Tensile tests were also conducted using quasi-static strain rates from 10-4 to 10-1 s-1 in order to obtain the tensile strength, elongation at fracture, and the elastic modulus of injection molded polymer and its nanocomposite. PP-CNF nanocomposites exhibited higher strain-rate sensitivity within the tested strain range, compared to the neat PP. Both the neat PP and PP-CNF nanocomposite exhibited strain-rate dependent material properties, showing an increase in tensile strength, and decrease in elongation with increasing strain rates.","Absar, Saheem; Tandon, Rohit; Choi, Hongseok",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315146; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315146,470

168989,Parental subjective wellbeing during the COVID-19 lockdown: Evidence from the epicenter of a pandemic crisis,2021,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common vector-borne viral disease with nearly 400 million worldwide infections each year concentrated in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Severe dengue complications are often associated with a secondary heterotypic infection of one of the four circulating serotypes. In this scenario, humoral immune responses targeting cross-reactive, poorly-neutralizing epitopes can lead to increased infectivity of susceptible cells via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In this way, antibodies produced in response to infection or vaccination are capable of contributing to enhanced disease in subsequent infections. Currently, there are no available therapeutics to combat DENV disease, and there is an urgent need for a safe and efficacious vaccine. Here, we developed a nucleotide-modified mRNA vaccine encoding for the membrane and envelope structural proteins from DENV serotype 1 encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles (prM/E mRNA-LNP). Vaccination of mice elicited robust antiviral immune responses comparable to viral infection with high levels of neutralizing antibody titers and antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Immunocompromised AG129 mice vaccinated with the prM/E mRNA-LNP vaccine were protected from a lethal DENV challenge. Vaccination with either a wild-type vaccine, or a vaccine with mutations in the immunodominant fusion-loop epitope, elicited equivalent humoral and cell mediated immune responses. Neutralizing antibodies elicited by the vaccine were sufficient to protect against a lethal challenge. Both vaccine constructs demonstrated serotype specific immunity with minimal serum cross-reactivity and reduced ADE compared to a live DENV1 viral infection. IMPORTANCE With 400 million worldwide infections each year, dengue is the most common vector-born viral disease. 40% of the world’s population is at risk with dengue experiencing consistent geographic spread over the years. With no therapeutics available and vaccines performing sub optimally, the need for an effective dengue vaccine is urgent. Here we develop and characterize a novel mRNA vaccine encoding for the dengue serotype 1 envelope and premembrane structural proteins that is delivered via a lipid nanoparticle. Our DENV1 prM/E mRNA-LNP vaccine induces neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses in immunocompetent mice and protects an immunocompromised mouse from a lethal DENV challenge. Existing antibodies against dengue can enhance subsequent infections via antibody-dependent enhancement. Importantly our vaccine only induced serotype specific immune responses and did not induce ADE.","Wollner, Clayton J.; Richner, Michelle; Hassert, Mariah A.; Pinto, Amelia K.; Brien, James D.; Richner, Justin M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.05.425517,470
169145,The Impact of Covid-19 Lockdown on Metamemory among Medical Students: An Experimental Study,2021,"Background and Purpose Virus-containing aerosol droplets emitted by breathing, speech or coughing dry rapidly to equilibrium with ambient relative humidity (RH), increasing in solute concentration with effects on virus survival and decreasing in diameter with effects on sedimentation and respiratory uptake. The aim of this paper is to model the effect of ionic and macromolecular solutes on droplet drying and solute concentration. Methods Deliquescence-efflorescence concepts and Kohler theory were used to simulate the evolution of solute concentrations and water activity in respiratory droplets, starting from efflorescence data on mixed NaCl/KCl aerosols and osmotic pressure data on respiratory macromolecules. Results In NaCl/KCl solutions supersaturated total salt concentrations were shown to reach 10-15M at the efflorescence RH of 40-55%, depending on the K:Na ratio. Dependence on K:Na ratio implies that the evaporation curves differ between aerosols derived from saliva and from airway surfaces. The direct effect of liquid droplet size through the Kelvin term was shown to be smaller and largely restricted to breath emissions. Modelling the effect of proteins and glycoproteins showed that salts determine drying equilibria down to the efflorescence RH, and macromolecules at lower RH. Conclusion Differences in drying behaviour are predicted between breathing, speech and coughing emissions and between droplet size fractions within these. High salt concentrations may inactivate some viruses.","Jarvis, Michael C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.25.436946,470
169174,COVID-19 unit in psychiatric hospital,2021,"Within a span of 11 months starting from December 2019, around 47.6 million people have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), including the number of deaths touching 1,215,601 on November 3, 2020. The number increases at an alarming rate with a possible second wave of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) throughout the world. A clear threat of another lockdown is looming over the social life and economy. Thus, scientists worldwide are running against the time to find small drug molecules as therapeutics and possible vaccines to relieve the world. Over the past months, computational chemistry and computer-aided drug design (CADD) have shown encouraging promises in generating multiple lead/hit compounds by employing powerful virtual screening techniques (VS) and drug repurposing of various approved and experimental drugs. The present chapter has enlisted and discussed the top 25 small molecule databases, including both synthetic as well as natural compounds. Most of the databases are freely available for research purposes, which can be strategically screened employing multiple computational techniques to discover therapeutics for COVID-19.","Kar, S.; Leszczynski, J.",Methods Pharmacol.

169180,Prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in chronically ill children and adolescents during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown: Preliminary findings of a pediatric hospital in Italy,2021,"Purpose: Children should attend well child visits (WCVs) during early childhood so that developmental disorders may be identified as early as possible, and if indicated treatment can begin. The aim of this research was to determine if rurality impacts access to WCV during early childhood, and if altering rurality measurement methods impacts outcomes. Design and Methods: We utilized a longitudinal correlational design with early childhood data gathered from the Virginia All Payer Claims Database, which contains claims data from Medicaid and the majority of Virginia commercial insurance payers (n=6349). WCV attendance was evaluated against three rurality metrics: a traditional metric using Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes, a developed land variable, and a distance to care variable, at a zip code level. Results: Two of the rurality methods revealed that rural children attend fewer WCVs than their urban counterparts, (67% vs. 50% respectively, using a traditional metric; and a 0.035 increase in WCV attendance for every percent increase in developed land). Differences were attenuated by insurance payer; children with Medicaid attend fewer WCVs than those with private insurance. Conclusions: Young children in rural Virginia attend fewer WCVs than their non-rural counterparts, placing them at higher risk for missing timely developmental disorder screenings. The coronavirus disease pandemic has been associated with an abrupt and significant reduction in vaccination rates, which likely indicates fewer WCVs and concomitant developmental screenings. Pediatric nurses should encourage families of young children to develop a plan for continued WCVs, so that early identification of developmental disorders can be achieved.","DeGuzman, P.

The term “e-placement” describes a placement undertaken off site from the placement organisation or agency. Students at James Cook University (JCU), Queensland, Australia, who could not continue in on-site placements were offered the opportunity to participate in a Community Connector Project (CCP) to complete their placement. The aims of the project were to provide an online supported placement experience in order to deliver a comprehensive and interactive learning experience for students to meet the learning outcomes of a field education experience, work with the community to explore community needs during the pandemic, share and distribute existing information and resources, and develop further information and resources. Twenty students chose to participate in the CCP. The project included biweekly meetings, small group work, and individual work. This paper was written collaboratively between field education staff, students, and a service provider. It presents practice reflections on the project and the project’s outcomes, challenges, and learning.

169756,Psychotic relapse from COVID-19 pandemic: Clinical features,2021,"An important challenge in vaccine development is to figure out why a vaccine succeeds in some individuals and fails in others. Although antibody repertoires hold a key to answering this question, there have been very few personalized immunogenomics studies so far aimed at revealing how variations in immunoglobulin genes affect a vaccine response. We conducted an immunosequencing study of 204 calves vaccinated against bovine respiratory disease (BRD) with the goal to reveal variations in immunoglobulin genes and somatic hypermutations that impact the efficacy of vaccine response. Our study represents the largest longitudinal personalized immunogenomics study reported to date across all species, including humans. To analyze the generated dataset, we developed an algorithm for identifying variations of the immunoglobulin genes (as well as frequent somatic hypermutations) that affect various features of the antibody repertoire and titers of neutralizing antibodies. In contrast to relatively short human antibodies, cattle have a large fraction of ultralong antibodies that have opened new therapeutic opportunities. Our study revealed that ultralong antibodies are a key component of the immune response against the costliest disease of beef cattle in North America. The detected variants of the cattle immunoglobulin genes, which are implicated in the success/failure of the BRD vaccine, have the potential to direct the selection of individual cattle for ongoing breeding programs.","Safonova, Yana; Shin, Sung Bong; Kramer, Luke; Reecy, James; Watson, Corey T.; Smith, Timothy P.L.; Pevzner, Pavel A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.06.454618,470

However, the origins of these cross-reactive antibodies and their potential impacts on vaccine efficacy have not been completely clarified. In this study, we demonstrated that the S2 subunit was the predominant target of the pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein cross-reactive antibodies in both healthy human and naive SPF mice. Through linear epitope mapping, we identified a dominant antibody epitope on the connector domain of S2 (aa1145-aa1162), which could be recognized by antibodies pre-existed in unexposed human and mice. Six monoclonal antibodies against this linear epitope were isolated from naive SPF mice and were proved to cross-react with commensal gut bacteria collected from both human and mouse. Via immunizing mice with a candidate DNA vaccine encoding the full length of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we further demonstrated that high levels of pre-existing S2 cross-reactive antibodies did not impair the immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine. On the contrary, mice with high levels of pre-existing antibodies mounted stronger S2 specific binding antibody responses compared to mice with low levels of pre-existing antibodies. In addition, S1 specific T cell and binding antibody responses also tended to be enhanced in mice with high levels of pre-existing antibodies.","Jia, L.; Weng, S.; Wu, J.; Tian, X.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, X.; Wang, J.; Yan, D.; Wang, W.; Zhu, Z.; Qiu, C.; Zhang, W.; Xu, Y.; Wan, Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.13.21260404v1?rss=1,470

While some of these patients have documented follow-ups on clinical records, or participate in longitudinal surveys, these datasets are usually designed by clinicians, and not granular enough to understand the natural history or patient experiences of ""long COVID"". In order to get a complete picture, there is a need to use patient generated data to track the long-term impact of COVID-19 on recovered patients in real time. There is a growing need to meticulously characterize these patients' experiences, from infection to months post-infection, and with highly granular patient generated data rather than clinician narratives. In this work, we present a longitudinal characterization of post-COVID-19 symptoms using social media data from Twitter. Using a combination of machine learning, natural language processing techniques, and clinician reviews, we mined 296,154 tweets to characterize the post-acute infection course of the disease, creating detailed timelines of symptoms and conditions, and analyzing their symptomatology during a period of over 150 days.","Banda, J.

170947,Digital psychiatry and COVID-19: a potential recruitment opportunity,2021,"Decentralized civic engagement, i.e. engagement which is not initiated and managed by government, has been often used as a popular slogan in various public speeches to highlight the importance of genuine civic interests in governance, yet offering very limited options on how to actually promote such involvement. The advent of the digital era has facilitated the development of a plethora of digital participatory platforms that could presumably help to boost the effective engagement of civic communities in decision making processes in an explicitly decentralized manner and, more so, the demand for such decentralized e-participation services is increasing during the current Covid-19 crisis. However, there is a real shortage of studies that directly focus on the analysis of such autonomous cases and all the more so from real life contexts in their natural settings. In this regard, this paper aims to fill the gap by analyzing the phenomena from an intrinsically peer-to-peer networking perspective, which could be observed today in popular autonomous civic engagement initiatives that have been launched in recent times in the area. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Kassen, M.",Technology in Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101650,470
171009,Anaesthetic Higher Specialty Training Recruitment in the United Kingdom During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National Survey,2021-07-07,"A study on the epidemiological Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is presented using free particle dynamics. The study is performed using a computational model consisting of randomly allocated particles in a closed domain which are free to move in random directions with the ability to collide with each other. The transmission rules for the particle-particle interactions are based on the main viral infection mechanisms, resulting in real-time results of the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered particles within a population of N = 200 particles. The results are qualitatively compared with a differential equation SIR model in terms of the transmission rate beta, recovery rate gamma, and the basic reproductive number R-0, yielding overall good results. The effect of the particle density rho(p) on R-0 is also studied to analyze how an infectious disease spreads over different types of populations. The versatility of the proposed free-particle-dynamics SIR model allows to simulate different scenarios, such as social distancing, commonly referred to as quarantine, no social distancing measures, and a mixture of the former and the latter. It is found that by implementing early relaxation of social distancing measures before the number of infected particles reaches zero, could lead to subsequent outbreaks such as the particular events observed in different countries due to the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis.","Garzon, F.; Olvera-Orozco, J.; Castro-Lopez, J.; Figueroa, A.",Revista Mexicana De Fisica,https://doi.org/10.31349/revmexfis.67.041402,470

We pursue insights about inequity in leveraging online information, spanning challenges with access and abilities to effectively seek and use digital information. We observe a widening of digital inequalities through a population-scale study of 55 billion everyday web search interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic across 25,150 US ZIP codes. We observe that ZIP codes with low socioeconomic status (SES) and high racial/ethnic diversity did not leverage health information and pandemic-relevant online resources (e.g., online learning, online food delivery) as much as regions with higher SES and lower levels of diversity. We also show increased shifts in online information access to financial or unemployment assistance for ZIP codes with low SES and high racial/ethnic diversity. These findings demonstrate that the pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities in online information access and highlight the role of large-scale, anonymized data about online search activities in digital disparities research.

In this study, we investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host microRNA (miRNA) populations in three human lung-derived cell lines, as well as in nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. We did not detect any major and consistent differences in host miRNA levels after SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we unexpectedly discovered a viral miRNA-like small RNA, named vmiR-5p (for viral miRNA), derived from the SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a transcript. Its abundance ranges from low to moderate as compared to host miRNAs. vmiR-5p functionally associates with Argonaute proteins — core components of the RNA interference pathway — leading to downregulation of host transcripts. One such host messenger RNA encodes Basic Leucine Zipper ATF-Like Transcription Factor 2 (BATF2), which is linked to interferon signaling. We demonstrate that vmiR-5p production relies on cellular machinery, yet is independent of Drosha protein, and is enhanced by the presence of a strong and evolutionarily conserved hairpin formed within the ORF7a sequence. Significance statement We discovered that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) expresses a small viral non-coding RNA, named vmiR-5p (for viral miRNA), derived from the ORF7a transcript. vmiR-5p associates with the cellular RNA interference machinery to regulate host transcripts likely via target silencing. The production of vmiR-5p relies on cellular machinery and the formation of a strong hairpin within ORF7a sequences. This newly-described vmiR-5p may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and could become a target for therapeutic intervention.","Pawlica, Paulina; Yario, Therese A.; White, Sylvia; Wang, Jianhui; Moss, Walter N.; Hui, Pei; Vinetz, Joseph M.; Steitz, Joan A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.08.459464,470
173856,Experiencing quarantine restrictions for adolescents with and without suicidal experience in Russia,2021,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) had its outbreak in December 2019. It has since spread across the world and caused great loss of life. Nowadays, computer tomography (CT) scans are a common and effective tool to detect COVID-19. However, manually detecting a huge amount of CT scans adds great pressure and causes additional workloads for physicians and radiologists, especially for those in areas where there is a severe COVID-19 pandemic. Driven by the desire of alleviating a medical worker's burden, here, we propose a hierarchical method in COVID-19 detection via CT scans in order to obtain a much faster detection result and one that is less labor-intensive. In this study, we present an automatic COVID-19 detection method, which consists of a hierarchical model made-up of two stages: a segmentation stage followed by a classification stage. In the segmentation stage, a U-Net is used to segment the lung portion from chest CT slices in order to eliminate the interference of irrelevant tissues such as the heart and bones. In the classification stage, ResNet-18 is applied to classify previously segmented CT slices (from the previous stage) and predict the existence of COVID-19. Experimental results show that our proposed hierarchical detection method obtains satisfying performances in separating COVID-19 CT scans from common pneumonia CT scans at the scan level, indicating that the method has great potential in assisting physicians and radiologists in rapid COVID-19 detection and significantly reducing their workload. © 2021 IEEE.","Zhang, Y.; Zhang, B.","2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, BDAI 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/bdai52447.2021.9515302,470

The purpose of this study is to investigate how working men and women's responsibilities for housework and childcare changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan depending on occupation, job type, and the number of employees in the workplace. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis (N=14,454) was conducted using data from an internet monitoring study (CORoNa Work Project), which was conducted in December 2020. A multilevel logistic model with nested prefectures of residence was conducted to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for change in time devoted to housework and childcare among men and women adjusting for age, household income, frequency of telecommuting, presence of spouse who work, occupation, job type, the number of employees in the workplace, and the incidence rate of COVID-19 by prefecture. Results: Regardless of occupation related factors, more women than men reported increased time spent on housework and childcare.

However, little is known about the relation between specific HIV-related factors and the severity of the COVID-19 disease. MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of cases collected through an on-line survey distributed by the Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe Network Group. In statistical analyses characteristics of HIV-positive patients asymptomatic/moderate and moderate/severe course were compared. ResultsIn total 34 HIV-positive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were reported by 12 countries (Estonia, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Albania, Belarus, Romania, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Poland, Russia, Hungary, Bulgaria). Asymptomatic courses of COVID-19 were reported in four (12%) cases, 11 (32%) patients presented with mild disease not requiring hospitalization, moderate disease with respiratory and/or systemic symptoms was observed in 14 (41%) cases, and severe disease with respiratory failure was found in five (15%) patients. The only HIV-related characteristics differentiating a moderate/severe course of the disease from asymptomatic/mild disease course was the use of or PI or NNRTI as part of the cART regimen (40.0% vs. 5.3%, p=0.0129 for PI and 31.6 % vs. 0.0%, p= 0.0239 for NNRTI). ConclusionsIn our analyses HIV viral suppression and immunological status were not playing a role in the course of COVID-19 disease. On the contrary the cART regimen could contribute to severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Large and prospective studies are necessary to further investigate this relations.","Kowalska, Justyna Dominika; Kase, Kerstin; Vassilenko, Anna; Harxhi, Arjan; Lakatos, Botond; Lukic, Gordana Dragovic; Verhaz, Antonija; Yancheva, Nina; Dumitrescu, Florentina; Jilich, David; Machala, Ladislav; Matulionyte, Raimonda",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.28.20221226,470

Given their use in over 180 countries, such data is of upmost importance to inform policy on optimal vaccination strategies. This study compares the immunogenicity of BNT162b2 with ChAdOx1 in patients receiving haemodialysis. Methods 1021 patients were screened for spike protein antibodies (anti-S) following 2 doses of either BNT162b2 (n=523) or ChAdOx1 (n=498). 191 patients underwent assessment with T-cell ELISpot assays. 65 health care workers were used as a control group. Results Anti-S was detected in 936 (91.2%) of patients post-vaccination. There was no difference in seroconversion rates between infection-naive patients who received BNT162b2, 248/281 (88.3%), compared with ChAdOx1, 227/272 (83.5%), p=0.11. Anti-S concentrations were higher following BNT162b, 462(152-1171) BAU/ml, compared with ChAdOx-1 79(20-213) BAU/ml, p<0.0001. Immunosuppression was associated with failure to seroconvert (p<0.0001); whilst being active on the transplant wait list was a predictor for seroconversion (p=0.02). Only 73 (38.2%) of patients had detectable T-cell responses post-vaccination, with no proportional difference between infection-naive patients who received BNT162b2, 2/19 (10.5%), versus ChAdOx1, 15/75 (20.0%), p=0.34. There were no quantitative differences in T-cell responses in infection-naive patients, with a median 2(0-16) SFU/106 PBMCs and 10(4-28) SFU/106 PBMCs in those receiving BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 respectively, p=0.35. These responses were significantly weaker compared with healthy controls. Conclusions. Enhanced immunogenicity was seen with BNT162b2 compared with ChAdOx1, driven by superior humoral responses, with attenuated T-cell responses to both vaccines. Comparative data on clinical efficacy is now required.","Clarke, C.

Circus training cultivates a community of bodies and generates tensions and discrepancies between the vision and values it predicates and their implementation in a neoliberal world. The present and future, personal and political sides of life intertwine in shaping and unsettling circus utopia. The lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic provided circus practitioners with time and new lenses to consider hopes, fears, doubts and certainties.The circus training utopia is explored drawing on the meanings, representations and definitions circulating among a diversity of actors and sites involved in processes of learning, participation and identity building through circus practices. Data were generated before the lockdown through interviews and participant observation conducted mainly in and around the city of Turin, Italy, and during the lockdown through analysis of specialized media and online conversations within the Italian circus scene.Insights are presented into how the lockdown reinforced and disrupted ideals about the appearance, skills and learning capacity of the circus body;the creative and disciplined character of circus practitioners;the alternative circus life of passion, fun, freedom, challenges and achievements;and the circus community resisting dominant culture and mainstream within the cultural field.Tensions emerged towards and against consistent, structured and widespread dialogue among actors and organizations, stronger public advocacy and claims for institutional recognition and support. These shed light on the fragmented character of the contemporary circus field in Italy, but also placed emphasis on and raised awareness about the need to build a stronger and more cohesive circus community, able to raise a common voice, empowering enough to stay on the utopic course while navigating COVID-19 society and its future.","Bessone, Ilaria",Performance Research,https://doi.org/10.1080/13528165.2020.1930781,470
176078,Facial mask masking tardive dyskinesia,2021,"Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been highly efficient in protecting against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the emergence of viral variants that are more transmissible and, in some cases, escape from neutralizing antibody responses has raised concerns. Here, we evaluated recombinant protein spike antigens derived from wild type SARS-CoV-2 and from variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 for their immunogenicity and protective effect in vivo against challenge with wild type SARS-CoV-2 in the mouse model. All proteins induced high neutralizing antibodies against the respective viruses but also induced high cross-neutralizing antibody responses. The decline in neutralizing titers between variants was moderate, with B.1.1.7 vaccinated animals having a maximum fold reduction of 4.8 against B.1.351 virus. P.1 induced the most cross-reactive antibody responses but was also the least immunogenic in terms of homologous neutralization titers. However, all antigens protected from challenge with wild type SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model. Author Summary The emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 has led to an urgency to study whether vaccines will lead to cross-protection against these variants. Here, we demonstrate that vaccination with spike proteins of various variants leads to cross-neutralizing responses, as well as protection in a mouse model against wild type SARS-CoV-2.","Amanat, Fatima; Strohmeier, Shirin; Meade, Philip; Dambrauskas, Nicholas; Mühlemann, Barbara; Smith, Derek J.; Vigdorovich, Vladimir; Sather, D.

Though patient characteristics associated with developing long COVID are partially known, those associated with persisting it have not been identified. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of patients after COVID-19 recovery who visited the National Center for Global Health and Medicine between February 2020 and March 2021. Demographic and clinical data, and the presence and duration of long COVID were obtained. We identified factors associated with development and persistence of long COVID using multivariate logistic and linear regression analysis, respectively. Results We analyzed 457 of 526 responses (response rate, 86.9%). The median age was 47 years, and 378 patients (84.4%) had mild disease in acute phase. The number of patients with any symptoms after 6 and 12 months after onset or diagnosis were 120 (26.3%) and 40 (8.8%), respectively. Women were at risk for development of fatigue (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.31-3.14), dysosmia (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.24-2.93), dysgeusia (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.02-2.39), and hair loss (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.77-5.09), and were at risk for persistence of any symptoms (coefficient 38.0, 95% CI 13.3-62.8). Younger age and low body mass index were risk factors for developing dysosmia (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.98, and OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.99, respectively) and dysgeusia (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-1.00, and OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.98, respectively).

To maintain quality of care, we used a new model. 1 week pre-clinic patient completed food and blood glucose diary plus questionnaires returning them via LibreView, Diasend or email. The CFRD MDT reviewed data (diabetologist, CF physician, diabetes nurse and dietitian) and planned management, then contacted patient with plan. Objective: Assess patient experience of VC to guide service development. Method: 15 questions designed on SurveyMonkey with patient representative. Survey sent to patients seen April-Nov. Patients invited to fill out the survey once even if >1 VC. Reminder email + text links sent 7 days later. Results: Survey distributed to 56 patients, response rate 50%. 88% returned food and blood glucose diaries pre-clinic. Majority (84%) uploaded data via LibreView and 100% of respondents found it easy to send. Participants reported positive experiences of VC. Reported advantages included less travel to clinic (63%), ability contact team between clinic (44%), able to upload glucose data at home (41%), VC reduces risk cross-infection (42%), able to contact MDT more frequently (37%). 64% reported no disadvantages (20% felt less personal). 58% would like option of Video consultations in future. Conclusion: Overall responses indicate positive reception of telehealth in the CFRD clinic. The introduction of VC enabled more regular monitoring of diabetes control using novel technology such as LibreView, Diasend and Dexcom CLARITY. The majority of patients found technology easy to use. Patients appreciated the frequent contact with the CFRD team, with support from their own homes reducing the barrier of travel on accessing treatment. Patients highlighted reduced risk of cross-infection during COVID-19 when they had heightened concerns.

The biotrauma hypothesis advances that mechanical forces from invasive ventilation trigger immunological factors that spread systemically. Yet, how these forces elicit an immune response remains unclear. Here we show that flow-induced stresses under mechanical ventilation can injure the bronchial epithelium of ventilated in vitro upper airway models and directly modulate inflammatory cytokine secretion associated with pulmonary injury. We identify site-specific susceptibility to epithelial erosion in airways from jet-flow impaction and measure an increase in cell apoptosis and modulated secretions of cytokines IL-6, 8 and 10. We find that prophylactic pharmacological treatment with anti-inflammatory therapeutics reduces apoptosis and pro-inflammatory signaling during ventilation. Our 3D in vitro airway platform points to a previously overlooked origin of lung injury and showcases translational opportunities in preclinical pulmonary research towards protective therapies and improved protocols for patient care.","Nof, Eliram; Artzy-Schnirman, Arbel; Bhardwaj, Saurabh; Sabatan, Hadas; Waisman, Dan; Hochwald, Ori; Gruber, Maayan; Borenstein-Levin, Liron; Sznitman, Josué",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.02.441992,470

This study examined whether use of HFNC increases aerosols and if there is a relationship between flow rate and near-field aerosol concentrations. Patients and Methods Subjects between 30 days and 2 years of age were enrolled. Each child received HFNC therapy at different flow rates over time. Three sampling stations with particle counters were deployed to measure aerosol generation and dispersion in the room: station one within 0.5 m of the subject, station two at 2 m, and station three on the other side of the room. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and relative humidity. Station three (far-field) measurements were used to adjust the station one (near-field) measurements for room conditions. Results We enrolled ten children ranging from 6-24 months (median 9 months), two with respiratory illness. Elevated CO2 indicated the near-field measurements were in the breathing plane of the subjects. Near-field breathing plane concentrations of aerosols 0.3-10 microns are elevated by the presence of the patient with no HFNC flow, relative to the room far-field, by 0.45 #/cm3. While we observed variability between subjects in their emission and dispersion of particles, we did not find an association between HFNC and near-field elevations of particle counts. Conclusion Near-patient levels of particles in the 0.3-10 micron range was not affected by the use of HFNC in healthy patients.

Although large population datasets, such as phone-based mobility data, may provide some glimpse into such compliance, it is often proprietary, and may not be available for all locales. In this work, we examine the usefulness of video sharing on social media as a proxy of the amount of time Internet users spend at home. In particular, we focus on the number of people sharing YouTube videos on Twitter before and during COVID19 lockdown measures were imposed by 109 countries. We find that the media sharing behavior differs widely between countries, in some having immediate response to the lockdown decrees - mostly by increasing the sharing volume dramatically - while in others having a substantial lag. We confirm that these insights correlate strongly with mobility, as measured using phone data. Finally, we illustrate that both media sharing and mobility behaviors change more drastically around mandated lockdowns, and less so around more lax recommendations. We make the media sharing volume data available to the research community for continued monitoring of behavior change around public health measures. © 2021 ACM.","Mejova, Y.; Kourtellis, N.","13th ACM Web Science Conference, WebSci 2021",https://doi.org/10.1145/3447535.3462494,470
176346,Social Entrepreneurship in COVID-19 Pandemic Experience from Sri Lanka,2021,"Sweet corn is consistently one of the most highly consumed vegetables in the U.S., providing a valuable opportunity to increase nutrient intake through biofortification. Significant variation for carotenoid (provitamin A, lutein, zeaxanthin) and tocochromanol (vitamin E, antioxidants) levels is present in temperate sweet corn germplasm, yet previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these traits have been limited by low statistical power and mapping resolution. Here, we employed a high-quality transcriptomic dataset collected from fresh sweet corn kernels to conduct transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and transcriptome prediction studies for 39 carotenoid and tocochromanol traits. In agreement with previous GWAS findings, TWAS detected significant associations for four causal genes, β-carotene hydroxylase (crtRB1), lycopene epsilon cyclase (lcyE), γ-tocopherol methyltransferase (vte4), and homogentisate geranylgeranyltransferase (hggt1) on a transcriptome-wide level. Pathway-level analysis revealed additional associations for deoxy-xylulose synthase2 (dxs2), diphosphocytidyl methyl erythritol synthase2 (dmes2), cytidine methyl kinase1 (cmk1), and geranylgeranyl hydrogenase1 (ggh1), of which, dmes2, cmk1, and ggh1 have not previously been identified through maize association studies. Evaluation of prediction models incorporating genome-wide markers and transcriptome-wide abundances revealed a trait-dependent benefit to the inclusion of both genomic and transcriptomic data over solely genomic data, but both transcriptome- and genome-wide datasets outperformed a priori candidate gene-targeted prediction models for most traits. Altogether, this study represents an important step towards understanding the role of regulatory variation in the accumulation of vitamins in fresh sweet corn kernels. Core Ideas Transcriptomic data aid the study of vitamin levels in fresh sweet corn kernels. crtRB1, lcyE, dxs2, dmes2, and cmk1 were associated with carotenoid traits. vte4, hggt1, and ggh1 were associated with tocochromanol traits. Transcriptomic data boosted predictive ability over genomic data alone for some traits. Joint transcriptome- and genome-wide models achieved the highest predictive abilities.","Hershberger, Jenna; Tanaka, Ryokei; Wood, Joshua C.; Kaczmar, Nicholas; Wu, Di; Hamilton, John P.; DellaPenna, Dean; Buell, C.

For the purpose of improving the performance of non-intrusive load decomposition, a non-intrusive load decomposition method based on a hybrid deep learning model is proposed. In this method, first of all, the data set is normalized and preprocessed. Secondly, a hybrid deep learning model integrating convolutional neural network (CNN) with long short-term memory network (LSTM) is constructed to fully excavate the spatial and temporal characteristics of load data. Finally, different evaluation indicators are used to analyze the mixture. The model is fully evaluated, and contrasted with the traditional single deep learning model. Experimental results on the open dataset UK-DALE show that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of the whole network system. In this paper, the proposed decomposition method is compared with the existing traditional deep learning load decomposition method.

176599,Cyberchondria: An emerging entity in COVID-19 pandemic and thereafter,2021,"Abstract Introduction: In recent years Ethiopia has made enormous strides in enhancing access to health care, especially, maternal and child health care (MCH). With the onset and spread of Covid-19, the attention of the health care system has pivoted to handling the disease, potentially at the cost of other health care needs. This paper explores whether this shift has come at the cost of non Covid related health care, especially the use of MCH services. Methods: Graphs, descriptive statistics and paired t-tests of significance are used to compare levels of inpatient and outpatient health care service utilization before and after the onset and spread of the virus. The analysis is based on a survey of 59 health centers and 29 public hospitals located in urban Ethiopia, the most acutely affected region of the country. Data on the use of health care services for a period of 24 months was gathered from the health management information systems (HMIS) of these facilities. Results: There is a sharp reduction in the use of both inpatient (20-27%) and outpatient (27-34%) care, particularly in Addis Ababa, which has been most acutely affected by the virus. However, the decline does not come at the cost of MCH services. The use of several MCH components (skilled birth attendant deliveries, immunization, post-natal care) remains unaffected throughout the period while others (family planning services, ante-natal care) experience a decline (8-17%) in the immediate aftermath but recover soon after. Conclusion: Concerns about the crowding out of MCH services due to the focus on Covid 19 are unfounded. Pro-active measures taken by the government and health care facilities to ring-fence the use of essential health care services have mitigated service disruptions. The results underline the resilience and agility displayed by one of the worlds most resource-constrained health care systems.","Shuka, Z. S.; Mebratie, A. D.; Alemu, G.; Rieger, M.; Bedi, A.

177161,The role of digital devices in chronic disease management during the Covid-19 pandemic—a study of senior citizens in Wuhan,2021,"Cortical processing of arithmetic and of language rely on both shared and task-specific neural mechanisms, which should also be dissociable from the particular sensory modality used to probe them. Here, spoken arithmetical and non-mathematical statements were employed to investigate neural processing of arithmetic, compared to general language processing, in an attention-modulated cocktail party paradigm. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data was recorded from 22 subjects listening to audio mixtures of spoken sentences and arithmetic equations while selectively attending to one of the two speech streams. Short sentences and simple equations were presented diotically at fixed and distinct word/symbol and sentence/equation rates. Critically, this allowed neural responses to acoustics, words, and symbols to be dissociated from responses to sentences and equations. Indeed, the simultaneous neural processing of the acoustics of words and symbols was observed in auditory cortex for both streams. Neural responses to sentences and equations, however, was predominantly to the attended stream, and originated primarily from left temporal, and parietal areas, respectively. Additionally, these neural responses were correlated with behavioral performance in a deviant detection task. Source-localized Temporal Response Functions revealed distinct cortical dynamics of responses to sentences in left temporal areas and equations in bilateral temporal, parietal and motor areas. Finally, the target of attention could be decoded from MEG responses, especially in left superior parietal areas. In short, the neural responses to arithmetic and language are especially well segregated during the cocktail party paradigm, and the correlation with behavior suggests that they may be linked to successful comprehension or calculation. Significance Statement Neural processing of arithmetic relies on dedicated, modality independent cortical networks that are distinct from those underlying language processing. Using a simultaneous cocktail party listening paradigm, we found that these separate networks segregate naturally when listeners selectively attend to one type over the other. Time-locked activity in the left temporal lobe was observed for responses to both spoken sentences and equations, but the latter additionally showed bilateral parietal activity consistent with arithmetic processing. Critically, these responses were modulated by selective attention and correlated with task behavior, consistent with reflecting high-level processing for speech comprehension or correct calculations. The response dynamics show task-related differences that were used to reliably decode the attentional target of sentences or equations.","Kulasingham, Joshua P.; Joshi, Neha H.; Rezaeizadeh, Mohsen; Simon, Jonathan Z.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.31.429030,470

Beyond liquidity and stimulus measures taken by central banks that feature in many past recessions, many Asian jurisdictions saw unprecedented provision of financial support and measures to businesses and individuals to tide them over and lessen the risk of insolvency. These measures included temporary moratoriums on financial obligations and debt recovery, relief from other contractual obligations, employment support, increases to the debt thresholds for the commencement of insolvency proceedings, and infrastructure investments.

Researchers have been able to produce vaccines, however, it is as recent as December 2020, that the use of the same has been initiated, though all such products are still being studied for their long-term safety and efficacy, since the virus is fast mutating. The discovery of specific antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 also has not seen the light of the day. Thus, the strategy to control the pandemic is largely focused on use of supplements and nutraceuticals, mostly plant based. These products can be used as preventive as well as to mitigate the symptoms and thereby provide therapy. Such products are ahead of other pharmacological candidates, as they are comparatively cheaper, easily available locally and the adverse reactions are negligible, if any. The nutraceuticals being used work as immunomodulators, thereby manipulating the immune response in mitigating the infection. They assist in regulating not only inflammation but also mediate the immune response to cater to preventing damage to respiratory system, the major concern in COVID-19. Many nutraceuticals have been found to benefit the disease conditions under various viral attacks, though detailed study on SARS-CoV-2 is underway for many such products. The current review focuses on presenting the nutraceuticals which have been evaluated for their antiviral properties. The antiviral effects are mediated through direct inhibition to the entry of the virus into host cells or through the indirect modulation of the immune system, thereby enhancing the recovery of patients. With their proven potential towards many disorders/diseases, their medicinal potential could be the sunlight in providing an end to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.","Mehrotra, N.; Jadhav, K.",Annals of Phytomedicine-an International Journal,https://doi.org/10.21276/ap.covid19.2021.10.1.9,470

The aim of the study was to identify and characterize the actions taken by food retail chain entities during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the context of the food security of consumers in Poland (using the example of Wielkopolska). A basic research hypothesis (H0) was generated, stating that the adaptation activities of food retail chain actors varied during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland with regard to ensuring consumer food security. It was detailed in five sub-hypotheses. In their verification and in the realization of the aim of the study, the methods of literature study and other secondary sources, and induction, survey, comparative, visualization, modeling and descriptive statistics, were used. The research results include (a) the authors' diagnosis of threats to the food security of companies in the food system resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and applied ways of adaptation to the new requirements of the environment, based on secondary sources;(b) analysis of data from the empirical survey conducted by the authors in November 2020 on the adaptive actions of companies, among managers/owners of food retail stores of a selected network of a particular franchise type in Greater Poland;(c) the construction of an empirical model of the typical behaviors of food retail units in the chain under study, distinguishing three of their types in the model;and (d) suggestions concerning the directions of future scientific research areas.

In this review, we searched available publications on the pharmacological treatment options for children with COVID-19. In total, 104 case reports and 15 cohort studies were included for analysis. For children, commonly applied medications were categorized into five main types: antivirals, antibacterials and antifungals, anti-inflammatories, anticoagulants, and vasopressors. Inhaled interferon was the most used antiviral in cohort studies, while hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or chloroquine (CQ) was the most in case reports. Different from adult patients, special consideration should be given to COVID-19 children diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Besides direct antiviral treatment, pharmacological care managing the inflammatory process comprises a great part of the treatment protocol. In addition to commonly used glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and aspirin, some biologics could be considered as potential treatment. Anakinra, an interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist, is highly recommended by the American College of Rheumatology as a safe treatment for children with MIS-C. The IL-6 receptor antagonist, tocilizumab, is also a potential treatment option.

NVX-CoV2373 is an adjuvanted, recombinant S protein nanoparticle vaccine that demonstrated clinical efficacy for prevention of Covid-19 in phase 2b/3 trials in the United Kingdom and South Africa. METHODS This phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of NVX-CoV2373 in adults [≥]18 years of age in the United States and Mexico during the first quarter of 2021. Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive two doses of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart. The primary end point was vaccine efficacy (VE) against reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed Covid-19 in SARS-CoV-2-naive participants [≥]7 days after the second dose administration. RESULTS Of the 29,949 participants randomized between December 27, 2020, and February 18, 2021, 29,582 (median age: 47 years, 12.6% [≥]65 years) received [≥]1 dose: 19,714 received vaccine and 9868 placebo. In the per-protocol population, there were 77 Covid-19 cases; 14 among vaccine and 63 among placebo recipients (VE: 90.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 82.9 to 94.6, P<0.001). All moderate-to-severe cases occurred in placebo recipients, yielding VE of 100% (95% CI 87.0 to 100). Most sequenced viral genomes (48/61, 78.7%) were variants of concern (VOC) or interest (VOI), mainly represented by variant alpha/B.1.1.7 (31/35, 88.6% VOC identified). VE against any VOC/VOI was 92.6% (95% CI 83.6 to 96.7). Reactogenicity was mostly mild-to-moderate and transient, but more frequent in NVX-CoV2373 recipients and after the second dose. Serious adverse events were rare and evenly distributed between treatments. CONCLUSIONS NVX-CoV2373 was well tolerated and demonstrated a high overall VE (>90%) for prevention of Covid-19, with most cases due to variant strains.

179633,Clozapine treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Abstract We propose a piecewise linear quantile trend model to analyse the trajectory of the COVID-19 daily new cases (i.e. the infection curve) simultaneously across multiple quantiles. The model is intuitive, interpretable and naturally captures the phase transitions of the epidemic growth rate via change-points. Unlike the mean trend model and least squares estimation, our quantile-based approach is robust to outliers, captures heteroscedasticity (commonly exhibited by COVID-19 infection curves) and automatically delivers both point and interval forecasts with minimal assumptions. Building on a self-normalized (SN) test statistic, this paper proposes a novel segmentation algorithm for multiple change-point estimation. Theoretical guarantees such as segmentation consistency are established under mild and verifiable assumptions. Using the proposed method, we analyse the COVID-19 infection curves in 35 major countries and discover patterns with potentially relevant implications for effectiveness of the pandemic responses by different countries. A simple change-adaptive two-stage forecasting scheme is further designed to generate short-term prediction of COVID-19 cumulative new cases and is shown to deliver accurate forecast valuable to public health decision-making.","Jiang, Feiyu Zhao Zifeng Shao Xiaofeng",Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Statistical Methodology),https://doi.org/10.1111/rssb.12453,470

We surveyed a large population with at least one olfactory disorder (N = 2031) and found that odor distortions were common (46%), with respondents reporting either parosmia (19%), phantosmia (11%), or both (16%). In comparison to respondents with hyposmia or anosmia, respondents with parosmia were more likely to be female, young, and suffered from post-viral olfactory loss (p < 0.001), while phantosmia occurred most frequently in middle-aged respondents (p < 0.01) and was more likely to be caused by head trauma than parosmia (p < 0.01). A higher prevalence of odor distortion was observed 3 months to a year after their olfactory symptom onset (p < 0.001), which coincides with the timeline of physiological recovery. Additionally, we observed that the frequency and duration of distortions negatively affects quality of life, with parosmia showing a higher range of severity than phantosmia (p < 0.001).

The developed theoretical model identifies the impacts of the perception of financial risk and financial anxiety on financial well-being. It also seeks, through a comparative analysis, to assess whether public servants, due to their status of job stability in Brazil, are less likely to have the effects of the pandemic than private employees. A survey was carried out on 1,222 Brazilians with structural equation modeling and multi-group invariance tests. The results indicate that lower financial well-being is influenced by the level of financial anxiety and financial risk. Public servants perceive fewer losses in financial well-being, anxiety and risks than other professions. In the pandemic context, where the risks of unemployment and loss of income are increased, job stability works like an insurance, allowing public servants greater financial security and then minor losses of financial well-being. Evidence indicates that in countries where a large percentage of workers have temporary or informal jobs, the challenge of reducing the financial impacts of the pandemic will be great. Interventions to alleviating anxiety and public policies of income transfer and reduction of unemployment are instruments to reduce the loss of financial well-being.","Vieira, Kelmara Mendes Potrich Ani Caroline Grigion Bressan Aureliano Angel Klein Leander Luiz",Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbef.2021.100554,470

The histone-modifying enzymes (HMEs) represent promising targets for the development of epigenetic drugs against Schistosoma mansoni. In the present study, we targeted the S. mansoni lysine-specific demethylase 1 (SmLSD1), a transcriptional corepressor, using a novel and selective synthetic inhibitor, MC3935. We synthesized a novel and potent LSD1 inhibitor, MC3935, which was used to treat schistosomula or adult worms in vitro. By using cell viability assays and optical and electron microscopy, we showed that treatment with MC3935 affected parasite motility, egg-laying, tegument, and cellular organelle structures, culminating in the death of schistosomula and adult worms. In silico molecular modeling and docking analysis suggested that MC3935 binds to the catalytic pocket of SmLSD1. Western blot analysis revealed that MC3935 inhibited SmLSD1 demethylation activity of H3K4me1/2. Knockdown of SmLSD1 by RNAi recapitulated MC3935 phenotypes in adult worms. RNA-seq analysis of MC3935-treated parasites revealed significant differences in gene expression related to critical biological processes. Collectively, our findings show that SmLSD1 is a promising drug target for the treatment of schistosomiasis and strongly support the further development and in vivo testing of selective schistosome LSD1 inhibitors. Author Summary Schistosomiasis mansoni is a chronic and debilitating tropical disease caused by the helminth Schistosoma mansoni. The control and treatment of the disease rely almost exclusively on praziquantel (PZQ). Thus, there is an urgent need to search for promising protein targets to develop new drugs. Drugs that inhibit enzymes that modify the chromatin structure have been developed for a number of diseases. We and others have shown that S. mansoni epigenetic enzymes are also potential therapeutic targets. Here we evaluated the potential of the S. mansoni histone demethylase LSD1 (SmLSD1) as a drug target. We reported the synthesis of a novel and potent LSD1 inhibitor, MC3935, and show that it selectively inhibited the enzymatic activity of SmLSD1. Treatment of juvenile or adult worms with MC3935 caused severe damage to the tegument of the parasites and compromised egg production. Importantly, MC3935 proved to be highly toxic to S. mansoni, culminating in the death of juvenile or adult worms within 96 h. Transcriptomic analysis of MC3935-treated parasites revealed changes in the gene expression of hundreds of genes involved in key biological processes. Importantly, SmLSD1 contains unique sequences within its polypeptide chain that could be explored to develop a S. mansoni selective drug.","Carneiro, Vitor Coutinho; de Abreu da Silva, Isabel Caetano; Amaral, Murilo Sena; Pereira, Adriana S.A.; Silveira, Gilbert O.; da Silva Pires, David; Verjovski-Almeida, Sérgio; Dekker, Frank J.; Rotili, Dante; Mai, Antonello; Torres, Eduardo José Lopes; Robaa, Dina; Sippl, Wolfgang; Pierce, Raymond J.; Borrello, M.

Mtb-complex DNA (TUB-band)-positivity, indeterminate rates, fluoroquinolone- and second-line injectable-resistance accuracy, banding differences and, separately, inter-reader variability were assessed. 39% of re-surveyed laboratories (5/13) did not use the manufacturer-recommended MTBDRsl ramp rate. On sputum, this ramp rate improved indeterminates vs. 4.0 {degrees} C/s (0/52 vs. 7/51; p=0.006), false drug-resistance calls (0/104 vs. 6/102; p=0.013), and incorrect banding calls (0/1300 vs. 55/1275; p<0.001). Valid results (neither TUB negative, indeterminate, nor any false drug-resistance calls) (52/52 vs. 41/51; p=0.001) on sputa hence improved by +21% (95% CI: 8-34%) with optimal ramp rate usage. Suboptimal ramp rate increased banding call inter-reader variability [52/1300 (4%) vs. 34/1300 (3%); p=0.030] on sputa but not dilution series; highlighting the importance of using clinical specimens for assay performance evaluations. Suboptimal ramp rate contributes to poor MTBDRsl performance. Ramp rate correction will improve second line drug-resistant TB diagnoses. Laboratories must ensure the optimal manufacturer-recommended ramp rate is used.","Derendinger, B.; de Vos, M.; Pillay, S.; Venter, R.; Metcalfe, J.; Ghebrekristos, Y.; Minnies, S.; Dolby, T.; Beylis, N.; Warren, R.; Theron, G.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.18.21257375v1?rss=1,470
180802,Covid madness,2021,"COVID-19 classified under emerging infectious diseases has spread across the world resulting in many casualties. India reported its first case on 30th January 2020 and has completed 100 days in this pandemic period. The government of India has issued stringent guidelines and imposed a lockdown for long periods to ensure the practising of social distancing. This paper reviews and discusses the current trends in the confirmed cases of India in comparison with the other prominent countries around the globe. A novel approach using a sigmoid function to predict and forecast the trends for cases in India are also presented in this work. By placing the current time on the sigmoid curve, forecasting the total number of confirmed cases by the end of the pandemic is made. If proper measures and stringent guidelines are not followed, India may have to endure a total confirmed case of up to 4.4 lakh. The prediction also suggests that 99.9% of the pandemic may end in India by 27th July 2020. The best possible approach is to undertake preventive measures by strictly adhering to the guidelines and policies set by the government. Performing hand hygiene, practicing social distancing, surveillance and isolation is the only means to break the chain of transmission and control the pandemic.","Gouda, Sheetal; Naveen, G.; Kukanur, F.

181090,Favorable Shift in CGM Glucose in Youth with T1D during COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Offset analgesia is characterized by a disproportionately large reduction in pain following a small decrease in a heat stimulus and is based on the phenomenon of temporal pain contrast enhancement (TPCE). The aim of this study is to investigate whether this phenomenon can also be induced by repetitive stimulation, i.e., by stimuli that are clearly separated in time. With this aim, the repetitive TPCE paradigm was induced in healthy, pain-free subjects (n=33) at the volar non-dominant forearm using heat stimuli. This paradigm was performed applying three different interstimulus intervals (ISIs): 5, 15, and 25 seconds. All paradigms were contrasted with a control paradigm without temperature change. Participants continuously rated the perceived pain intensity. In addition, electrodermal activity was recorded as a surrogate measure of autonomic arousal. Temporal pain contrast enhancement was confirmed for both ISI 5 seconds (p < 0.001) and ISI 15 seconds (p = 0.005), but not for ISI 25 seconds (p = 0.07), however the magnitude of TPCE did not differ between ISIs (p = 0.11). Electrodermal activity was consistent previous pain ratings, but showing significantly higher autonomic activity being measured. Thus, the phenomenon of temporal contrast enhancement of pain can also be induced by repetitive stimulation. Both the involvement of the autonomic nervous system and the involvement of habituation processes are conceivable, which consequently points to both central and peripheral mechanisms of TPCE. Summary The temporal contrast enhancement of pain and electrodermal activity can be provoked by stimuli that are clearly separated in time.","Szikszay, Tibor M.; Adamczyk, Waclaw M.; Lévénez, Juliette L.

Substantial information and throughput gain may now be achieved by automated acquisition of virtually all structures in a given EM section. Resulting datasets allow convenient pan-and-zoom examination of tissue ultrastructure with preserved microanatomical orientation. The technique is, however, critically sensitive to artifacts in sample preparation. We therefore established a methodology to prepare large-scale digitization samples (LDS) designed to acquire entire sections free of obscuring flaws. For evaluation, we highlight the supreme performance of scanning EM in transmission mode compared to other EM technology.

Instead of relying on pairwise comparisons between 10 countries with fixed-effects regression models to isolate the effect of lockdown measures, I modelled the development of the pandemic with and without lockdown measures for the entire period and all countries included in the data with one mixed-effects regression model. My results reconciled the conflicting conclusions of Haug et al. (2020) and Bendavid et al. (2021): while no general decrease in COVID-19 growth rates was attributable to the implementation of lockdown measures, mandatory stay-at-home orders did lead to substantial decreases in COVID-19 growth rates in some countries and sub-national units.

The SHIELD trial, a randomised controlled, single (assessor) blind, trial of 12 weeks SLH vs usual care for people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (n=120) was set-up to help to address this. The first group started face-to-face (5 sessions) before changing to online delivery (7 sessions) due to COVID-19 related physical distancing measures. As such, the experience of this group is here reported as a pilot study to inform further research in this area. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis regarding barriers, facilitators and key considerations regarding transitioning from face-to-face to online delivery. Pilot quantitative outcomes include attendance, pre and post measures of quality of life and disease impact (SF-36, CAT score), breathlessness (MRC breathlessness scale, Dyspnoea-12), depression (PHQ9), anxiety (GAD-7), balance confidence (ABC scale) and physical activity (clinical visit PROactive physical activity in COPD tool, combining subjective rating and actigraphy). Results Attendance was 69% overall, (90% of the face-to-face sessions, 53% online sessions). Analysis of semi-structured interviews identified three themes regarding participation in SLH delivered face-to-face and online, these where 1) perceived benefits; 2) digital barriers (online); 3) digital facilitators (online). Findings were summarised into key considerations for optimising transitioning singing groups from face-to-face to online delivery.

However, the cytokine profiles and eosinophil activation status linked to the association between viral infections and sensitization to aeroallergens are incompletely understood. Here we investigated respiratory viruses, serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and various cytokines/chemokines in acute exacerbation of childhood asthma. METHODS We analyzed peripheral eosinophil counts, serum ECP, and 27 cytokines/chemokines in 76 virus-induced acute asthma cases with or without aeroallergen sensitization. Asthma due to sensitization was defined by a positive reaction to at least one aeroallergen in serum specific IgE antibody tests. Virus detection was performed using antigen detection kits and/or RT-PCR, followed by direct DNA sequencing analysis. Serum cytokines/chemokines were measured using a multi-cytokine detection system. RESULTS Peripheral eosinophil counts and serum ECP and IL-5 levels were significantly elevated in sensitized cases compared with nonsensitized cases. Conversely, IP-10 values were significantly higher in nonsensitized cases. An inverse correlation between IP-10 and IL-5 production was identified in virus-induced acute exacerbations of asthma but not in controls. CONCLUSIONS Cytokine profiles and eosinophil activation status might be different between sensitized and nonsensitized cases of virus-induced acute exacerbations of asthma.","Suzuki, Kazuo; Kato, Masahiko; Matsuda, Shinichi; Nukaga, Mariko; Enseki, Mayumi; Tabata, Hideyuki; Hirai, Kota; Yamada, Yoshiyuki; Maruyama, Kenichi; Hayashi, Yasuhide; Mochizuki, Hiroyuki",The Tokai journal of experimental and clinical medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27988920/,470

MATERIALS AND METHODS Chest radiographs obtained at clinical presentation and during treatment in 138 patients with confirmed SARS (66 men, 72 women; mean age, 39 years; age range, 20-83 years) were assessed. Radiographic appearances of pulmonary parenchymal abnormality, distribution, and extent of involvement on initial chest radiographs were documented. Recognizable patterns of radiographic progression were determined by comparing the overall mean percentage of lung involvement for each patient on serial radiographs. RESULTS Initial chest radiographs were abnormal in 108 of 138 (78.3%) patients and showed air-space opacity. Lower lung zone (70 of 108, 64.8%) and right lung (82 of 108, 75.9%) were more commonly involved. In most patients, peripheral lung involvement was more common (81 of 108, 75.0%). Unifocal involvement (59 of 108, 54.6%) was more common than multifocal or bilateral involvement. No cavitation, lymphadenopathy, or pleural effusion was demonstrated. Four patterns of radiographic progression were recognized: type 1 (initial radiographic deterioration to peak level followed by radiographic improvement) in 97 of 138 patients (70.3%), type 2 (fluctuating radiographic changes) in 24 patients (17.4%), type 3 (static radiographic appearance) in 10 patients (7.3%), and type 4 (progressive radiographic deterioration) in seven patients (5.1%). Initial focal air-space opacity in 44 of 59 patients (74.6%) progressed to unilateral multifocal or bilateral involvement during treatment.

We developed and validated prognostic rules for both high- and low-resource settings based on data available at the time of admission. METHODS We analyzed data on all 1755 and 291 patients with SARS in Hong Kong (derivation cohort) and Toronto (validation cohort), respectively, using a multivariable logistic scoring method with internal and external validation. Scores were assigned on the basis of patient history in a basic model, and a full model additionally incorporated radiological and laboratory results. The main outcome measure was death. RESULTS Predictors for mortality in the basic model included older age, male sex, and the presence of comorbid conditions. Additional predictors in the full model included haziness or infiltrates on chest radiography, less than 95% oxygen saturation on room air, high lactate dehydrogenase level, and high neutrophil and low platelet counts. The basic model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.860 in the derivation cohort, which was maintained on external validation with an area under the ROC curve of 0.882. The full model improved discrimination with areas under the ROC curve of 0.877 and 0.892 in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION The model performs well and could be useful in assessing prognosis for patients who are infected with re-emergent SARS.","Cowling, Benjamin J; Muller, Matthew P; Wong, Irene O L; Ho, Lai-Ming; Lo, Su-Vui; Tsang, Thomas; Lam, Tai Hing; Louie, Marie; Leung, Gabriel M",Archives of internal medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16864761/,470

There is limited information on the strengths and weaknesses of the systems of care for addressing ZIKV and other neurodevelopmental disabilities (NRD) in the United States (US) Affiliated Pacific Island Territories. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to assess the quality of the chronic illness systems of care for children with congenital ZIKV and other NRD in the US Pacific Island Territories. A cross-sectional study was conducted among health professionals from American Samoa, Guam, and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Participants completed an adapted version of the Assessment of Chronic Illness Care 3.5 (ACIC), which is based on the Chronic Care Model. The median Total Program Score was calculated, which ranged from limited support (0-2), basic support (3-5), reasonably good support (6-8), to fully developed support for care (9-11). Among the 17 health professionals who completed the survey, 47% were Guamanian/Chamorro, 24% were Samoan, 12% were Filipino, and 6% were Other Pacific Islanders. The median (25th percentile, 75th percentile [interquartile range]) Total Program Score was 5 (3, 6 [3]), indicating basic support for ZIKV and other NRD care for children. As more is learned about the full spectrum of clinical findings related to ZIKV, it is critical to continue to build an interdisciplinary maternal and child health workforce with the capacity and preparation to adequately address the special needs of children with ZIKV and other NRD.","Zai, Tiffany; Yasuda, Patrice M; Rao, Sheela; Iizumi, Staci; Vanderbilt, Douglas L; Deavenport-Saman, Alexis",Hawai'i journal of health & social welfare,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32914095/,470

Indeed, scientists around the world express the view that despite the danger, research on these emerging virulent pathogens is crucial and must continue. While most of the studies underway are targeted at improving and protecting public health, some studies bear potentiallyserious risks resulting from misuse. These studies are defined as dual-use research of concern (DURC), where it is not evident that the benefits outweigh the risks. The H5N1 controversy has pushed various governments to institute new policies to govern such research. We describe the regulations that govern this emerging field of research in the United States and Israel, two countries that have taken leading stands on these issues. We suggest that the existing policies are able to mitigate many of the risks that this research encapsulates, yet more work is required--especially on the global level.","Lev, Ori; Rager-Zisman, Bracha",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25558694/,470

Inouye College of Pharmacy Scripts: Panic or Panacea, Changing the Pharmacist's Role in Pandemic COVID-19.",2020-07-01,"A number of feline coronavirus isolates have been characterized over the last few years. These isolates consist of what we have referred to as feline enteric coronaviruses (FECVs) and feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPVs). FECVs cause a transient enteritis in kittens but no systemic illness. FIPVs, in contrast, cause a systemic and usually fatal disease syndrome characterized either by an exudative serositis or a disseminated granulomatous disease. Although the diseases they cause are quite different, FECVs and FIPVs are antigenically and morphologically indistinguishable from each other. FECVs have a strict tropism for mature intestinal epithelial cells and do not appear to replicate in macrophages. In contrast, FIPVs, appear to spread rapidly from the intestinal mucosa and replicate in macrophages. Experiments will be presented, and literature cited, that will allow us to make the following assumptions about the pathogenesis of FIPV infection: 1) FIPVs and FECVs represent a spectrum of viruses that differ only in infectivity (ability to evoke seroconversion following oral infection) and virulence (ability to cause FIP), 2) field isolates are generally nearer to FECVs in behavior than laboratory isolates made from animal passaged material, 3) immunity to FIPV appears to be of the premunition type and is maintained for as long as the infection persists in a reactivatable form, 4) strains of feline coronaviruses that do not cause systemic disease, such as FECVs or low virulence FIPVs, can actually sensitize cats to infection with virulent FIPV strains, 5) FeLV infection interferes with established FIP immunity and allows for the reactivation of disease in healthy carriers, 6) FIPV may be passaged from queen to kitten either in utero or during neonatal life, and 7) kittens infected by their mothers with FIPV do not usually develop FIP but become immune carriers of the virus for a period of 5-6 months; recovery from the carrier state is associated with a loss of premunition immunity.","Pedersen, N C",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2829567/,470

There is a hyperinflammatory response involved in the clinical course of patients with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2. To date, there has been no definite therapy for COVID-19. We reviewed the charts of SARS-CoV-2 patients with pneumonia and moderate to severely elevated CRP and worsening hypoxemia who were treated with early, short-term dexamethasone. METHODS We describe a series of 21 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were admitted to The Miriam Hospital in Providence, RI, and were treated with a short course of dexamethasone, either alone or in addition to current investigative therapies. RESULTS CRP levels decreased significantly following the start of dexamethasone from mean initial levels of 129.52 to 40.73 mg/L at time of discharge. 71% percent of the patients were discharged home with a mean length of stay of 7.8 days. None of the patients had escalation of care, leading to mechanical ventilation. Two patients were transferred to inpatient hospice facilities on account of persistent hypoxemia, in line with their documented goals of care. CONCLUSIONS A short course of systemic corticosteroids among inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 with hypoxic respiratory failure was well tolerated, and most patients had improved outcomes. This limited case series may not offer concrete evidence towards the benefit of corticosteroids in COVID-19. However, patients' positive response to short-term corticosteroids demonstrates that they may help blunt the severity of inflammation and prevent a severe hyperinflammatory phase, in turn reducing the length of stay, ICU admissions, and healthcare costs.","Selvaraj, Vijairam; Dapaah-Afriyie, Kwame; Finn, Arkadiy; Flanigan, Timothy P",Rhode Island medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32570995/,470

Constitutional authority for public health resides primarily with the provinces. The federal government has obtained the authority to legislate in this area primarily through its power over criminal law. Challenges facing the establishment of national public health programs include the ambiguity over constitutional responsibility, challenges in managing externalities and spillovers, and issues related to funding and data ownership. Policy-making is also complicated by the importance of municipal and supranational governments in public health. National programs need to be structured in a way that balances the advantages of regional approaches to public health challenges with the benefits of a coordinated central response. To do so, policy-makers need to address unique challenges to public health governance.","Wilson, Kumanan",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15622787/,470

METHODS T lymphocyte subsets, activated states of T and B lymphocytes, and expressions of CD3(+) and 24 TCR Vbeta subfamilies in 76 convalescent SARS patients were detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS The percentages of CD3(+) and CD4(+) T cells were lower than normal reference (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). The percentage of CD8(+) T lymphocytes was higher than normal reference (P<0.01),while the percentage of CD8(+)/CD28(-) T cells (Ts) in 49 convalescent SARS patients increased, and that of CD8(+)/CD28(+) T cells (Tc) in 39 patients decreased. The percentage of activated T cells (Ta,CD3(+)/HLA-DR(+)) in 36 convalescent SARS patients and the percentage of activated B cells (Ba, CD3(-)/HLA-DR(+)) in 30 convalescent SARS patients were higher than normal references. Expression of TCR Vbeta14 was the commonest in 24 TCR Vbeta repertoire both in SARS patients and normal controls, followed by TCR Vbeta5.3 in SARS patients, but Vbeta20 in normal controls. Besides, the expressions of TCR Vbeta1, Vbeta5.2, Vbeta5.3, Vbeta7.2, Vbeta9, Vbeta11, Vbeta13.1, Vbeta13.2, Vbeta17, Vbeta18, Vbeta22 and Vbeta23 in SARS group were all significantly higher than those in normal group. And the expressions of TCR Vbeta4, Vbeta22 and Vbeta23 in SARS patients treated with glucocorticoid(>1 000 U) were higher than those in SARS patients without treatment. CONCLUSION Increased Ts cell may lead to increased CD8(+) T cells in convalescent SARS patients. The suppressor factors secreted by Ts cells may decrease CD3(+) and CD4(+) T cells. Expression of TCR Vbeta on T cells from convalescent SARS patients were different from normal controls. The increased Ta and Ba expressions may be associated with activation of T and B cells.","Zeng, Xing; Cai, Cui; Huang, Yu; Ou, Ai-Hua; Zhang, Xian",Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15629099/,470

The ELISAs were based on either lipopolysacharide (LPS ELISA) or flagellar antigen (GP ELISA). Sensitivity was determined with 79 case herds with a wide range of clinical signs. Specificity was determined with 125 Dutch and 200 Swedish control herds. The relation between antibodies in bulk milk, antibodies in serum, and the level of milk production of individual cows was studied with 61 case herds. The optimal optical density (OD) values of the LPS ELISA and the GP ELISA were determined to be 0.2 and 0.5, respectively. The sensitivities of the LPS ELISA and the GP ELISA were 54 and 63%, respectively, with a specificity of 98% for both ELISAs with samples from the Dutch control herds. The specificities for samples from the Swedish herds were 100% for the LPS ELISA and 95% for the GP ELISA. The sensitivity of the combination of tests was 65% when samples were run in parallel, and the specificity was 100% when samples were run in series, irrespective of whether the samples came from Dutch or Swedish control herds. The variance (R(2)) in the OD value for bulk milk samples could be explained by the percentage of seropositive lactating cows in a herd with the LPS ELISA for 51% of the samples and with the GP ELISA for 72%. The variance in the OD value was best explained by the combination of the percentage of seropositive lactating cows in the herd and the mean log(10) serum antibody titer for that herd (R(2) = 62% for the LPS ELISA and R(2) = 75% for the GP ELISA). Case herds more often tested negative by the ELISA with bulk milk when the percentage of seropositive lactating cows was less than 5%. It is concluded that both ELISAs with bulk milk can be used in control programs to distinguish between infected and noninfected herds. Specificity can be increased by using the two tests in combination. Sensitivity was relatively low for both single tests and both tests combined.","Veling, J; van Zijderveld, F G; van Zijderveld-van Bemmel, A M; Schukken, Y H; Barkema, H W",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11687438/,470

We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis in order to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19-induced liver injury. PATIENTS AND METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library, for studies reporting laboratory data about COVID-19 patients, with last update on 25th March 2020. The primary outcome was the pooled prevalence of COVID- 19-induced liver damage, mainly represented by increase in serum transaminases and bilirubin. The secondary outcome was the description of abnormalities in serum albumin and prothrombin time (PT). We focused on laboratory data only on hospital admission, and adopted random-effects model for meta-analysis. RESULTS Eleven studies were eligible for meta-analysis. Out of 793 included patients, the pooled prevalence of COVID-19-related liver damage was 22.17% (95% CI 17.64 to 27.07), mostly indicated by hypertransaminasemia. Serum bilirubin was increased in 5.53% (95% CI 3.60 to 7.85) of cases. Abnormal serum albumin was observed in 78.92% (95% CI 39.82 to 99.56), and increased PT value in 19.98% (95% CI 2.49 to 78.23), but these results derived from significantly heterogeneous studies. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19-induced liver injury must not be ignored, as it is observed in one fifth of infected patients.

With the ultimate aim of studying mucosal immunity to MHV we have cloned the genes encoding the structural proteins of MHV strain A59 (MHV-A59) into the E3 region of a human adenovirus type 5 vector. Infection of HeLa cells with the resulting recombinant adenoviruses AdMHVS, AdMHVN and AdMHVM revealed the correct expression of the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, respectively. Intraperitoneal inoculation of BALB/c mice with the recombinant viruses elicited serum antibodies which specifically recognized the respective MHV proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay. Only antibodies to the S protein neutralized MHV-A59 in vitro but titres were low. When analysed by ELISA or by immunofluorescence only the antibody response to the N protein was significant; weak responses or no detectable response at all were found for S and M, respectively. Upon intracerebral challenge with a lethal dose of MHV-A59 we found that a significant fraction of animals vaccinated with adenovirus vectors expressing either the S protein or N protein were protected. This protective effect was significantly stronger when the animals were given a booster immunization with the same vector prior to challenge. No protection was induced by AdMHVM. Interestingly, enhanced protection resulted when AdMHVS and AdMHVN were applied in combination as compared to survival after single immunizations. The results indicate that both the N and S proteins generate a protective immune response and suggest that this response is enhanced by combined expression of the two proteins.","Wesseling, J G; Godeke, G J; Schijns, V E; Prevec, L; Graham, F L; Horzinek, M C; Rottier, P J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8409930/,470

We report here that PYC inhibits not only human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) binding to host cells, but also its replication after entry in susceptible cells in vitro. Prominent biochemical alterations induced by PYC were the elevated expression of an intracellular antioxidant protein, manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), and the inhibition of phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein. Interestingly, ectopic expression of Mn-SOD inhibited HIV-1 replication as well. Inhibition of HIV-1 replication associated with induced expression of Mn-SOD in cells treated with PYC suggests the potential of this natural antioxidant inducer as a new anti-HIV-1 agent.","Feng, Wu Yu; Tanaka, Ritsuko; Inagaki, Yoshio; Saitoh, Yasunori; Chang, Myint Oo; Amet, Tohti; Yamamoto, Norio; Yamaoka, Shoji; Yoshinaka, Yoshiyuki",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18653969/,470

Preventing hyperinflammation is key to avoiding these outcomes. We previously demonstrated that alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists ($\alpha$-blockers) can prevent cytokine storm syndrome and death in mice. Here, we conduct a retrospective analysis of patients with acute respiratory distress or pneumonia (n = 13,125 and n = 108,956, respectively) from all causes; patients who were incidentally taking $\alpha$-blockers had a reduced risk of requiring ventilation (by 35% and 16%, respectively), and a reduced risk of being ventilated and dying (by 56% and 20%, respectively), compared to non-users. Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists had no significant effects. These results highlight the urgent need for prospective trials testing whether prophylactic $\alpha$-blockers improve outcomes in diseases with a prominent hyperinflammatory component such as COVID-19.","Vogelstein, Joshua T; Powell, Michael; Koenecke, Allison; Xiong, Ruoxuan; Fischer, Nicole; Huq, Sakibul; Khalafallah, Adham M; Caffo, Brian; Stuart, Elizabeth A; Papadopoulos, Nickolas; Kinzler, Kenneth W; Vogelstein, Bert; Zhou, Shibin; Bettegowda, Chetan; Konig, Maximilian F; Mensh, Brett; Athey, Susan",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32550250/,470

In parallel, an immunochromatographic test was also evaluated. A total of 227 clinical serum specimens collected from SARS patients were used in the study, together with 385 samples from healthy donors. By use of an immunofluorescent (IF) test as the ""gold standard"", both the ELISA and the immunochromatographic test were able to detect immunoglobulin G antibodies to SARS not only from late-convalescent-stage samples (>21 days from the onset of clinical symptoms), as previously established, but also from early-acute-phase samples (1 to 10 days from onset). The ELISA, using an optical density (OD) of 0.25 as its cutoff value, produced the best sensitivity while maintaining high specificity. It detected SARS-specific antibodies in 58, 70, 75, and 95%, respectively, of the four groups of samples collected from patients 1 to 10 days, 11 to 20 days, 21 to 30 days, and more than 30 days after the onset of clinical symptoms. Similarly, the immunochromatographic test detected SARS-specific antibodies in 55, 68, 81, and 79% of the four groups, respectively. The overall specificities for the ELISA and the rapid test were 99.5 and 97.7%, respectively. Although the positive correlation observed between the ELISA OD values and the IF titers was moderate (r = 0.6915; P < 0.001), the detection rates of both the ELISA and the rapid test were found well in agreement with the IF titers.","Guan, Ming; Chan, Kwok Hung; Peiris, J S Malik; Kwan, See Wai; Lam, Siu Yan; Pang, Chiu Mei; Chu, Ka Wing; Chan, Kit Man; Chen, Hsiao Ying; Phuah, Ewe Beng; Wong, Caiqin Jane",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15242944/,470

We aimed to review the experience of a large healthcare organization with Permacol™. A retrospective study was conducted of patients who underwent abdominal hernia repair with Permacol™ in 14 Southern California hospitals. One hundred ninety-five patients were analyzed over a 4-year period. Operations included ventral/incisional hernia repairs, ostomy closures, parastomal hernia repairs, and inguinal hernia repairs. In 50 per cent of the patients, Permacol™ was used to reinforce a primary fascial repair and in 50 per cent as a fascial bridge. The overall complication rate was 39.5 per cent. The complication rate was higher in patients with infected versus clean wounds, body mass index (BMI) 40 kg/m(2) or greater versus BMI less than 40 kg/m(2), in patients with prior mesh repair, and when mesh was used as a fascial bridge. With a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, morbid obesity was associated with a higher recurrence. To date this is the largest study on the use of Permacol™ in abdominal wall hernia repair. In our patient population undergoing heterogeneous operations with a majority of wounds as Class II or higher, use of Permacol™ did not eliminate wound morbidity or prevent recurrence, especially in morbidly obese patients.","Cheng, Amy W; Abbas, Maher A; Tejirian, Talar",The American surgeon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24160785/,470

201866,What Happened to Person-Centered Care? Observations During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The 5'-terminal genomic region (8597 nt) of little cherry virus (LChV), a mealybug-borne closterovirus, was cloned from double-stranded RNA, and its sequence determined to complete the 16934 nt sequence of the monopartite LChV RNA genome. In the 5' to 3' direction, the sequence encompasses ORF 1a, encoding the conserved replicative domains of methyltransferase and helicase, and ORF 1b, encoding RNA polymerase. ORFs 1a and 1b partially overlap (in O/+1 configuration), and the LChV replicase is probably expressed by ribosomal frameshifting as a fusion product with a molecular mass of 318 kDa. The N-terminal part of the ORF 1a product contains a papain-like cysteine proteinase (PCP) domain with a predicted cleavage site between Gly-619 and Ser-620. The PCP and the upstream protein domains can be aligned with the equivalent parts of the leader proteins encoded by the whitefly-transmitted lettuce infectious yellows and sweet potato sunken vein closteroviruses. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on the aligned RNA polymerase sequences clearly suggests that the aphid-transmissible and whitefly-transmissible closteroviruses represent two distinct evolutionary lineages, with the mealybug-transmissible LChV being the most remote member of the 'whitefly' lineage.","Jelkmann, W; Fechtner, B; Agranovsky, A A",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9267008/,470

202407,Videoconferencing of Involuntary Commitment Hearings in the COVID Era,2021,"BACKGROUND: Doublet chemotherapy in combination with a biologic agent has been a standard of care in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer for over a decade. The evidence for a ""lighter"" treatment approach is limited to mono-chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in the RAS unselected population. Anti-EGFR antibodies have activity as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy in RAS wildtype metastatic colorectal cancer; however their role in first-line treatment in combination with 5-fluorouracil monotherapy or when given alone has not been well studied. MONARCC aims to investigate this approach in an elderly population. METHODS/DESIGN: MONARCC is a prospective, open-label, multicentre, non-comparative randomised phase II trial. Eligible patients aged &#8805;70 with unresectable metastatic, untreated, RAS/BRAF wildtype metastatic colorectal cancer will be randomised 1:1 to receive panitumumab alone or panitumumab plus infusional 5-fluorouracil. RAS and BRAF analyses will be performed in local laboratories. Comprehensive Health Assessment and Limited Health Assessments will be performed at baseline and at 16 weeks, respectively, to assess frailty. The Patient Symptom Questionnaire and Overall Treatment Utility are to be undertaken at different timepoints to assess the impact of treatment-related toxicities and quality of life. Treatment will be delivered every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity (as determined by treating clinician or patient), delay of treatment of more than 6 weeks, or withdrawal of consent. The primary end point is 6-month progression-free survival in both arms. Secondary end points include overall survival, time to treatment failure, objective tumour response rate as defined by RECIST v1.1 and safety (adverse events). Tertiary and correlative endpoints include the feasibility and utility of a comprehensive geriatric assessment, quality of life and biological substudies. DISCUSSION: MONARCC investigates the activity and tolerability of first-line panitumumab-based treatments with a view to expand on current treatment options while maximising progression-free and overall survival and quality of life in molecularly selected elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

Methods: We performed an observational, cross sectional, and secondary data analysis. The study had three dependent variables that were obtained from a locally validated questionnaire, in which it is asked whether the professionals had the perception that they could be infected with SARS-CoV-2 at work, or could transmit the virus to their family/friends, and regarding the possibility of complications related to the infection. Results: Of the 2843 workers participating in the study, those in the health sector perceived that they were more likely to be infected at work. In the multivariate analysis, adjusted for four variables, health sector workers also perceived that they could be infected more frequently at work (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR): 1.74;95% confidence interval (CI): 1.40-2.15;p &lt;0.001). These professionals, moreover, perceived that they could transmit the virus to their family/friends (aPR: 0.76;95% CI: 0.63-0.92;p = 0.005) or that there would be complications resulting from the infection (aPR: 0.59;95% CI: 0.48-0.73;p &lt;0.001). On the other hand, engineering sector workers were the ones who had a greater perception that they could infect their family/friends (aPR: 1.95;95% CI: 1.20-3.20;p = 0.007), while workers from other sectors perceived that they could have more chances of complications from the infection (aPR: 1.17;95% CI: 1.05-1.30;p = 0.006).

Results: the World Health Organization has pointed out that the path to reduce the speed of circulation of the virus, control and decrease in the number of cases and deaths resulting from this pandemic can only be accomplished with mass adoption of fundamental measures that include hand hygiene, alcohol gel use, cough etiquette, cleaning surfaces, avoiding agglomerations and social distancing. The epidemiological curve of the disease clearly shows the devastating proportions in Italy, Spain and the United States, surpassing China in death records, due to the delay in adopting the aforementioned measures. In Brazil, the rapid progression in relation to the world and Latin America points to an important increase in the number of cases.

In November 2020, CDC interim guidance stated that routine vaccination of children and adolescents should remain an essential preventive service during the COVID-19 pandemic (4,5). To further understand the impact of the pandemic on routine childhood and adolescent vaccination, vaccine administration data during March-September 2020 from 10 U.S. jurisdictions with high-performing* immunization information systems were assessed. Fewer administered doses of routine childhood and adolescent vaccines were recorded in all 10 jurisdictions during March-September 2020 compared with those recorded during the same period in 2018 and 2019. The number of vaccine doses administered substantially declined during March-May 2020, when many jurisdictions enacted stay-at-home orders. After many jurisdictions lifted these orders, the number of vaccine doses administered during June-September 2020 approached prepandemic baseline levels, but did not increase to the level that would have been necessary to catch up children who did not receive routine vaccinations on time. This lag in catch-up vaccination might pose a serious public health threat that would result in vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, especially in schools that have reopened for in-person learning. During the past few decades, the United States has achieved a substantial reduction in the prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases driven in large part to the ongoing administration of routinely recommended pediatric vaccines. These efforts need to continue even during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce the morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases. Health care providers should assess the vaccination status of all pediatric patients, including adolescents, and contact those who are behind schedule to ensure that all children are fully vaccinated.","Patel Murthy, Bhavini; Zell, Elizabeth; Kirtland, Karen; Jones-Jack, Nkenge; Harris, LaTreace; Sprague, Carrie; Schultz, Jessica; Le, Quan; Bramer, Cristi A; Kuramoto, Sydney; Cheng, Iris; Woinarowicz, Mary; Robison, Steve; McHugh, Ashley; Schauer, Stephanie; Gibbs-Scharf, Lynn",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,470

Herein, we assessed the impact of COVID-19 on subthreshold depressive symptoms and identified potential mitigating factors. METHODS: Participants were from Depression Cohort in China (ChiCTR registry number 1900022145). Adults (n = 1722) with subthreshold depressive symptoms were enrolled between March and October 2019 in a 6-month, community-based interventional study that aimed to prevent clinical depression using psychoeducation. A total of 1506 participants completed the study in Shenzhen, China: 726 participants, who completed the study between March 2019 and January 2020 (i.e. before COVID-19), comprised the 'wave 1' group; 780 participants, who were enrolled before COVID-19 and completed the 6-month endpoint assessment during COVID-19, comprised 'wave 2'. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia were assessed at baseline and endpoint (i.e. 6-month follow-up) using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), respectively. Measures of resilience and regular exercise were assessed at baseline. We compared the mental health outcomes between wave 1 and wave 2 groups. We additionally investigated how mental health outcomes changed across disparate stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, i.e. peak (7-13 February), post-peak (14-27 February), remission plateau (28 February-present). RESULTS: COVID-19 increased the risk for three mental outcomes: (1) depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.62); (2) anxiety (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.16-1.88) and (3) insomnia (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07-1.77). The highest proportion of probable depression and anxiety was observed post-peak, with 52.9% and 41.4%, respectively. Greater baseline resilience scores had a protective effect on the three main outcomes (depression: OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.19-0.37; anxiety: OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.14-0.33 and insomnia: OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.11-0.28). Furthermore, regular physical activity mitigated the risk for depression (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.79-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic exerted a highly significant and negative impact on symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia. Mental health outcomes fluctuated as a function of the duration of the pandemic and were alleviated to some extent with the observed decline in community-based transmission. Augmenting resiliency and regular exercise provide an opportunity to mitigate the risk for mental health symptoms during this severe public health crisis.","Liao, Y H; Fan, B F; Zhang, H M; Guo, L; Lee, Y; Wang, W X; Li, W Y; Gong, M Q; Lui, L M W; Li, L J; Lu, C Y; McIntyre, R S",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,,470

207766,Lockdown logistics in consultation-liaison psychiatry,2020,"BACKGROUND: The optimal approach for cancer screening after an ischemic stroke remains unclear. AIMS: We sought to summarize the existing evidence regarding the frequency and predictors of cancer after an ischemic stroke. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: We searched seven databases from January 1980 to September 2019 for articles reporting malignant tumors and myeloproliferative neoplasms diagnosed after an ischemic stroke (PROSPERO protocol: CRD42019132455). We screened 15,400 records and included 51 articles. The pooled cumulative incidence of cancer within one year after an ischemic stroke was 13.6 per thousand (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6-24.8), higher in studies focusing on cryptogenic stroke (62.0 per thousand; 95% CI, 13.6-139.3 vs 9.6 per thousand; 95% CI, 4.0-17.3; p = 0.02) and those reporting cancer screening (39.2 per thousand; 95% CI, 16.4-70.6 vs 7.2 per thousand; 95% CI, 2.5-14.1; p = 0.003). Incidence of cancer after stroke was generally higher compared to people without stroke. Most cases were diagnosed within the first few months after stroke. Several predictors of cancer were identified, namely older age, smoking, and involvement of multiple vascular territories as well as elevated C-reactive protein and d-dimers. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of incident cancer after an ischemic stroke is low, but higher in cryptogenic stroke and after cancer screening. Several predictors may increase the yield of cancer screening after an ischemic stroke. The pooled incidence of post-stroke cancer is likely underestimated, and larger studies with systematic assessment of cancer after stroke are needed to produce more precise and valid estimates.","Rioux, Bastien; Touma, Lahoud; Nehme, Ahmad; Gore, Genevieve; Keezer, Mark R; Gioia, Laura C",Int J Stroke,,470
207788,"Lessons Learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic: Emphasizing the Emerging Role and Perspectives from Artificial Intelligence, Mobile Health, and Digital Laboratory Medicine",2021,"Seminal plasma (SP) is the natural environment for spermatozoa and contains a number of components, especially proteins important for successful sperm maturation and fertilization. Nevertheless, in standard frozen stallion insemination doses production, SP is completely removed and is replaced by a semen extender. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of the selected seminal plasma protein groups that might play an important role in reducing the detrimental effects on spermatozoa during the cryopreservation process. SP proteins were separated according to their ability to bind to heparin into heparin-binding (Hep+) and heparin-non-binding (Hep-) fractions. The addition of three concentrations-125, 250, and 500 µg/mL-of each protein fraction was tested. After thawing, the following parameters were assessed: sperm motility (by CASA), plasma membrane integrity (PI staining), and acrosomal membrane integrity (PNA staining) using flow cytometry, and capacitation status (anti-phosphotyrosine antibody) using imaging-based flow cytometry. Our results showed that SP protein fractions had a significant effect on the kinematic parameters of spermatozoa and on a proportion of their subpopulations. The 125 µg/mL of Hep+ protein fraction resulted in increased linearity (LIN) and straightness (STR), moreover, with the highest values of sperm velocities (VAP, VSL), also this group contained the highest proportion of the fast sperm subpopulation. In contrast, the highest percentage of slow subpopulation was in the groups with 500 µg/mL of Hep+ fraction and 250 µg/mL of Hep- fraction. Interestingly, acrosomal membrane integrity was also highest in the groups with Hep+ fraction in concentrations of 125 µg/mL. Our results showed that the addition of protein fractions did not significantly affect the plasma membrane integrity and capacitation status of stallion spermatozoa. Moreover, our results confirmed that the effect of SP proteins on the sperm functionality is concentration-dependent, as has been reported for other species. Our study significantly contributes to the lack of studies dealing with possible use of specific stallion SP fractions in the complex puzzle of the improvement of cryopreservation protocols. It is clear that improvement in this field still needs more outputs from future studies, which should be focused on the effect of individual SP proteins on other sperm functional parameters with further implication on the success of artificial insemination in in vivo conditions.","Bubenickova, Filipa; Postlerova, Pavla; Simonik, Ondrej; Sirohi, Jitka; Sichtar, Jiri",,,470

Some patients with severe or critical COVID-19 have been observed to have elevated bilirubin levels. Studies on the association of bilirubin level and mortality in patients with COVID-19 are limited. This study aimed to examine the role of bilirubin levels in COVID-19 severity and mortality. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China. Cox regression analyses and logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the risks for mortality and disease severity, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analyses with log-rank tests were performed to assess the association between bilirubin level and survival. Results: In total, 1,788 patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. 5.8% (4/69) of patients in the elevated serum total bilirubin (STB) group died, compared to 0.6% (11/1,719) of patients in the non-elevated STB group. The median alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities in the elevated STB group were 29 U/L [interquartile range (IQR): 16-45 U/L] and 22 U/L (IQR: 13-37 U /L), respectively, which were significantly higher than the median ALT (median: 23, IQR: 15-37) and AST (median: 20, IQR: 16-26) activities in the non-elevated STB group (both p < 0.05). Patients with an elevated STB level showed increased mortality [hazard ratio (HR): 9.45, P = 0.002], elevated conjugated bilirubin (CB) levels (HR: 4.38, P = 0.03), and an elevated ratio of CB to unconjugated bilirubin (UCB, CB/UCB) (HR: 2.49, P = 0.01). CB/UCB was positively correlated with disease severity (odds ratio: 2.21, P = 0.01). Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with elevated STB and CB levels had a higher mortality, and CB/UCB was predictive of disease severity and mortality. Thus, it is necessary to pay special attention to COVID-19 patients with elevated bilirubin levels in clinical management.","Liu, Zeming; Li, Jinpeng; Long, Wei; Zeng, Wen; Gao, Rongfen; Zeng, Guang; Chen, Danyang; Wang, Shipei; Li, Qianqian; Hu, Di; Guo, Liang; Li, Zhengwei; Wu, Xiaohui",Front Med (Lausanne),,470

209097,Functional Connectome Prediction of Anxiety Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Most cohorts show similar or lower COVID-19 incidence among people living with HIV compared with the general population. However, incidence might be affected by lower testing rates among vulnerable populations. We aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence, disease severity, and neutralising antibody activity after infection among people with and without HIV receiving care in a county hospital system over a 3-month period. METHODS: In this matched case-control observational study, remnant serum samples were collected between Aug 1 and Oct 31, 2020, from all people living with HIV who underwent routine outpatient laboratory testing in a municipal health-care system (San Francisco General Hospital, CA, USA). Samples from people living with HIV were date of collection-matched (same day) and age-matched (±5 years) to samples from randomly selected adults (aged 18 years or older) without HIV receiving care for chronic conditions at the same hospital. We compared seroprevalence by HIV status via mixed-effects logistic regression models, accounting for the matched structure of the data (random effects for the matched group), adjusting for age, sex, race or ethnicity, and clinical factors (ie, history of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, and type 2 diabetes). Severe COVID-19 was assessed in participants with past SARS-CoV-2 (IgG or PCR) infection by chart review and compared with multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex. SARS-CoV-2 IgG, neutralising antibody titres, and antibody avidity were measured in serum of participants with previous positive PCR tests and compared with multivariable mixed-effects models, adjusting for age, sex, and time since PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. FINDINGS: 1138 samples from 955 people living with HIV and 1118 samples from 1062 people without HIV were tested. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence was 3·7% (95% CI 2·4 to 5·0) among people with HIV compared with 7·4% (5·7 to 9·2) among people without HIV (adjusted odds ratio 0·50, 95% CI 0·30 to 0·83). Among 31 people with HIV and 70 people without HIV who had evidence of past infection, the odds of severe COVID-19 were 5·52 (95% CI 1·01 to 64·48) times higher among people living with HIV. Adjusting for time since PCR-confirmed infection, SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations were lower (percentage change -53%, 95% CI -4 to -76), pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres were lower (-67%, -25 to -86), and avidity was similar (7%, -73 to 87) among people living with HIV compared with those without HIV. INTERPRETATION: Although fewer infections were detected by SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing among people living with HIV than among those without HIV, people with HIV had more cases of severe COVID-19. Among people living with HIV with past SARS-CoV-2 infection, lower IgG concentrations and pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres might reflect a diminished serological response to infection, and the similar avidity could be driven by similar time since infection.

By ratiometric tuning of its constituents, the multicomponent molecular switch is prepared in a hyperresponsive state-the transition state-that can be readily activated upon the binding of sparse RNA targets to turn on substantial enzymatic activity. CATCH thus achieves superior performance (~8 RNA copies/µl), direct fluorescence detection that bypasses all steps of PCR (<1 hour at room temperature), and versatile implementation (high-throughput 96-well format and portable microfluidic assay).

The severity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic-and the urgent need for safe blood products to respond to such crises-demands an immediate reconsideration of the 3-month deferral policy for MSM.We review historical HIV testing and transmission evidence, discuss the ethical ramifications of the current deferral period, and examine the issue of noncompliance with donor deferral rules.

These entities may appear after resolution of the respiratory syndrome. CASE REPORT A previously healthy 64-year-old male patient came to the hospital reporting severe chest pain. He had a history of a COVID-19 pneumonia with PCR confirmation 4 weeks before. On admission to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU), the patient had a negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2; the following tests were performed: total T3 643.4 ng/dl (reference 35-193 ng/dl), total thyroxine 12.0 µg/dl (reference 4.8-11.7 µg/dl), free T4 1.85 ng/dl (reference 0.7-1.48 ng/dl), TSH 0.01 µIU/ml (reference 0.35-4.94 µIU/ml); total bilirubin 0.76 mg/dl (reference 0.0-1.5 mg/dl), alkaline phosphatase 185 U/L (reference 40-150 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 194.6 U/L (reference 6-66 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase 93.4 U/L (reference 9-55 U/L); on admission to the CCU high-sensitivity troponin I 548.3 pg/ml (reference 0.0-34.2 pg/ml), after 24 h in the CCU 801 pg/ml, and after 11 days (as an outpatient) 4.5 pg/ml. A thyroid gammagram revealed absent uptake of the radionuclide. Normal cardiac gammagraphy and cardiac enzymes ruled out myocardial ischemia and infarction. The following diagnoses were made: myocarditis, subacute thyroiditis, and reactive hepatitis due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 has been demonstrated to be a multisystemic inflammatory disorder. The serious illness that developed in our patient after relief of his pulmonary disease underlines this nature.

This sudden halt to collective life meant that non-essential services were closed and many health promoting activities (i.e. physical activity, school) were stopped in their tracks. To curb the negative health impacts of lockdown measures, activities adapting to this new reality were urgently developed. One form of activity promoted indoor physical activity to prevent the adverse physical and psychological effects of the lockdown. Another form of activity included the rapid development of online learning tools to keep children and youth engaged academically while not attending school. While these health promoting efforts were meant to benefit the general population, we argue that these interventions may have unintended consequences and inadvertently increase health inequalities affecting marginalized youth in particular, as they may not reap the same benefits, both social and physical, from the interventions promoting at-home physical activities or distance learning measures. We elaborate on several interventions and their possible unintended consequences for marginalized youth and suggest several strategies that may mitigate their impact.","Alexander, Stephanie A; Shareck, Martine",Health promot. internation,,470
210577,Rapid Adoption of Telehealth at an Interprofessional Student-Run Free Clinic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Although demographic and clinical parameters such as sex, age, comorbidities, genetic background and various biomarkers have been identified as risk factors, there is an unmet need to predict the risk and onset of severe inflammatory disease leading to poor clinical outcomes. In addition, very few mechanistic biomarkers are available to inform targeted treatment of severe (auto)-inflammatory conditions associated with COVID-19. Calprotectin, also known as S100A8/S100A9, MRP8/14 (Myeloid-Related Protein) or L1, is a heterodimer involved in neutrophil-related inflammatory processes. In COVID-19 patients, calprotectin levels were reported to be associated with poor clinical outcomes such as significantly reduced survival time, especially in patients with severe pulmonary disease. AREAS COVERED: Pubmed was searched using the following keywords: Calprotectin + COVID19, S100A8/A9 + COVID19, S100A8 + COVID-19, S100A9 + COVID-19, MRP8/14 + COVID19; L1 + COVID-19 between May 2020 and 8 March 2021.

The regression analysis revealed that nursing intention had a significant relationship with older age (pâ<â0.001,S.Eâ=â1.11,Bâ=â17.02), higher income level (pâ<â0.001,S.Eâ=â1.81,Bâ=â6.98), having previous training (pâ=â0.008,S.Eâ=â1.22,Bâ=â3.27), higher stress level (pâ<â0.001,S.Eâ=â2.37,Bâ=â-21.39), and high professionalism level (pâ<â0.001,S.Eâ=â1.16,Bâ=â11.99). CONCLUSION: Having an adequate staff requirement plan, planning appropriate training for nurses, and proactive psychological support are crucial to prevent burnout and continue to provide nursing services.","Zandian, Hamed; Alipouri Sakha, Minoo; Nasiri, Elhameh; Zahirian Moghadam, Telma",Work,,470
211720,Heart Rate Reactivity to Acute Psychological Stress Predicts Higher Levels of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has prompted pediatric residency programs to adjust the delivery of educational curricula and to update content relevant to the pandemic OBJECTIVE: In this descriptive paper, we present how we rapidly developed and implemented a COVID-19 pandemic elective for pediatric residents METHODS: This curriculum was established at a single tertiary care children's hospital in June 2020 We used the ADDIE (analysis, design, development, implementation, evaluation) framework to develop a two-week elective (30 hours) consisting of six flexibly scheduled modules We administered post-elective surveys and exit interviews to solicit feedback to improve the elective and obtain effectiveness of our educational interventions RESULTS: We developed an asynchronous online COVID-19 Elective for Pediatric Residents The curriculum modules focus on pathophysiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the disaster management ecosystem, simulation of clinical care, mental health ramifications, and public health consequences We also include six in-situ experiences (visits to a drive-through COVID-19 testing site, testing laboratory and local public health department, a simulation of a critically ill child, and meetings with emergency managers and social workers) to solidify learning and allow for further reflection To date, eight participants have taken the elective All participants strongly agreed on a five-point Likert item survey that the elective enhanced their knowledge in current evidence-based literature for COVID-19, disaster preparedness, hospital response, management of the critically ill child, and mental and public health ramifications All participants agreed this curriculum was relevant to and will change their practice CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate how a COVID-19 elective for pediatric residents could be quickly developed and implemented The pilot results show that pediatric trainees value asynchronous learning, supplemented by relevant in-situ experiences Moreover, these results suggest that this curriculum provides needed disaster response and resiliency education for pediatric residents","Iyer, M.

211721,Heart rate reactivity to acute psychological stress predicts higher levels of PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Solidarity in the general sense means unity or agreement of feeling or action, especially among individuals with a common interest; or mutual support within a group. There are different ways of standing in solidarity in different kinds of literatures. One of the most important ways is to advocate. Advocacy is a win-win strategy and a process of supporting and enabling people to express their views and concerns. In the end, I think sharing different types of solidarity can be one of the drivers that stimulate the solidarity itself, and I call on everyone to contribute to this sharing. I hope that this solidarity, which began in the world with the beginning of COVID-19, will not end with its end and will last forever because our world needs coexistence.

Methods: The retrospective study included 7 critical COVID-19 patients with acro-ischemia in a single center in Wuhan, from Feb 4 to Feb 15, 2020. The clinical and laboratory data before and during the ICU stay were analyzed. Results: The median age of 7 patients was 59 years and 4 of them were men. 3 of them were associated with underlying comorbidities. Fever, cough, dyspnea and diarrhea were common clinical symptoms. All patients had acro-ischemia presentations including finger/toe cyanosis, skin bulla and dry gangrene. D-dimer, fibrinogen and fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) were significantly elevated in most patients. Prothrombin time (PT) were prolonged in 4 patients. D-dimer and FDP levels increased progressively when COVID-2019 exacerbated, and 4 patients were diagnosed with definite disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 6 patients received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment, after which their D-dimer and FDP decreased, but there was no significant improvement in clinical symptoms. 5 patients died finally and the median time from acro-ischemia to death was 12 days. Conclusions: The existence of hypercoagulation status in critical COVID-2019 patients should be monitored closely, and anticoagulation therapy can be considered in selected patients. More clinical data is needed to investigate the role of anticoagulation in COVID-2019 treatment.","Zhang, Y; Cao, W; Xiao, M; Li, Y J; Yang, Y; Zhao, J; Zhou, X; Jiang, W; Zhao, Y Q; Zhang, S Y; Li, T S",Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,,470

Impulse response functions show that COVID-19 infections in Australia have a significant positive effect on the performance of the stock market: a one standard deviation increase in new registered cases of COVID-19 infections in Australia increases the daily growth rate of the ASX-200 by around half a percentage point. This result is robust to alternative lag selections of the VAR model as suggested by alternative information criteria, including in the model control variables for stock market volatility, that is the ASX-200 VIX;the USD-AUD exchange rate and the international oil price;news by the World Health Organization regarding a COVID-19 pandemic and public health emergency;and the government-imposed shutdown of parts of the Australian economy. We also present estimates of the dynamic relationship between the daily growth rate of the Dow Jones and daily new cases of COVID-19 infections in the United States. The US data show, similar to the Australian data, that there is a significant positive effect of COVID-19 infections on the performance of the stock market.","Brueckner, Markus Vespignani Joaquin",Economic Papers: A journal of applied economics and policy,,470
212237,"Protection measures, dental education, and Covid-19 spread: A brief narrative review",2021,"More than one year into the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare systems across the world continue to be overwhelmed with soaring daily cases. The treatment spectrum primarily includes ventilation support augmented with repurposed drugs and/or convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT) from recovered COVID-19 patients. Despite vaccine variants being recently developed and administered in several countries, challenges in global supply chain logistics limit their timely availability to the wider world population, particularly in developing countries. Given the measured success of conventional CPT in treating several infections over the past decade, recent studies have reported its effectiveness in decreasing the duration and severity of COVID-19 symptoms. In this review, we conduct a literature search of published studies investigating the use of CPT to treat COVID-19 patients from January 2020 to January 2021. The literature search identified 181 records of which 39 were included in this review. A random-effects model was used to aggregate data across studies, and mortality rates of 17 vs. 32% were estimated for the CPT and control patient groups, respectively, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.49. The findings indicate that CPT shows potential in reducing the severity and duration of COVID-19 symptoms. However, early intervention (preferably within 3 days), recruitment of donors, and plasma potency introduce major challenges for its scaled-up implementation. Given the low number of existing randomized clinical trials (RCTs, four with a total of 319 patients), unanticipated risks to CPT recipients are highlighted and discussed. Nevertheless, CPT remains a promising COVID-19 therapeutic option that merits internationally coordinated RCTs to achieve a scientific risk-benefit consensus.","Kanj, Saly; Al-Omari, Basem",Viruses,,470

The methodology that organizations who provide home health and personal home care services are using to respond to this pandemic has not yet been characterized. In this report, we describe our approach to comprehensive outbreak suppression and report an initial case series of COVID-19 positive patients receiving home-based services. We implemented enhanced infection control procedures across our affiliates, and we communicated these protocols to our offices using multi-faceted methods. Using custom built software applications enabling us to track patient and employee cases and exposures, we leveraged current public health recommendations to identify cases and to suppress transmission. In the 100-day period between January 20, 2020 and April 30, 2020, our affiliates provided services to 67 COVID-19 positive patients (&lt;0.3% of census). Twenty patients were referred to home health post hospitalization for COVID-19 related illness, whereas 47 were found to have COVID-19 while living in community settings. Of those who were found to have COVID-19 in the community, 17 (39%) required subsequent hospitalization. Hospitalized patients had an average age of 74.5 ± 18, and 53% were male. There were 13 deaths (76%) among those hospitalized from the community with COVID-19 related illness.

The marked inflammatory response and coagulopathic state in acute SARS-CoV-2 may promote pulmonary fibrosis. However, little is known of the incidence and seriousness of post-COVID pulmonary pathology. OBJECTIVES: We describe respiratory recovery and self-reported health following infection at time of outpatient attendance. METHODS: Infection severity was graded into three groups: (i) not requiring admission, (ii) requiring hospital admission, and (iii) requiring ICU care. Participants underwent chest radiography and six-minute-walk test (6MWT). Fatigue and subjective return to health were assessed and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6, soluble CD25 and D-dimer were measured. The association between initial illness and abnormal chest x-ray, 6MWT distance and perception of maximal exertion was investigated. RESULTS: 487 patients were offered an outpatient appointment, of which 153 (31%) attended for assessment at a median of 75 days after diagnosis. 74 (48%) had required hospital admission during acute infection. Persistently abnormal chest x-rays were seen in 4%. The median 6MWT distance covered was 460m. Reduced distance covered was associated with frailty and length of inpatient stay. 95 (62%) felt that they had not returned to full health, while 47% met the case definition for fatigue. Ongoing ill-health and fatigue were associated with increased perception of exertion. None of the measures of persistent respiratory disease were associated with initial disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the rates of objective respiratory disease and subjective respiratory symptoms following COVID-19 and the complex multifactorial nature of post-COVID ill-health.","Townsend, Liam; Dowds, Joanne; O039,; Brien, Kate; Sheill, Grainne; Dyer, Adam H; Kelly, Brendan; Hynes, John P; Mooney, Aoife; Dunne, Jean; Ni Cheallaigh, Cliona; Farrelly, Cliona; Bourke, Nollaig M; Conlon, Niall; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Bergin, Colm; Nadarajan, Parthiban; Bannan, Ciaran",Ann.

214803,Anatomy: Beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Abstract Brewin (2020) was optimistic about the fate of the Canadian grains and oilseeds sector in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic descended on the world. The sector did generate a large crop and, towards the end of 2020, saw a lift in prices. This contributed to record farm income in Canada in 2020. The pace of grain and oilseed exports in Canada and ethanol demand in the east were affected by COVID-19, but the forecast of a ?near normal? 2020 was relatively accurate. Production and prices stayed on track, largely because the world did not impose significant new barriers to trade in cereals and oilseeds and because these sectors have distanced labor in virtually every step of the supply chain which protected these markets from this pandemic. The dominant price factor for the sector remains global demand that had been growing before 2020 relative to the pace of production and may have been stimulated by deficit budgets around the world. Compared to the tight global stocks, COVID-19 had a minor impact on grain prices which led to steady production worldwide and in Canada. We are still waiting for more evidence to assess the role of federal coordination in the success of the grains and oilseed sector in 2020, but Canada's past participation in trade and safety protocols based on science allowed the grains and oilseed sector in Canada to earn a very good income in 2020.","Brewin, Derek Gerald",Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics/Revue canadienne d&#039;agroeconomie,,470

215445,The enclosed ward management strategies in psychiatric hospitals during COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"BACKGROUND: As a result of the continuing surge of COVID-19, many patients have delayed or missed routine screening and preventive services. Medical conditions, such as coronary heart disease, mental health issues, and substance use disorder, may be identified later, leading to increases in patient morbidity and mortality. METHODS: The National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) data were used to assess 911 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) activations during 2018-2020. For specific activation types, the percentage of total activations was calculated per week and joinpoint analysis was used to identify changes over time. RESULTS: Since March 2020, the number of 911 emergency medical services (EMS) activations has decreased, while the percentages of on-scene death, cardiac arrest, and opioid use/overdose EMS activations were higher than pre-pandemic levels. During the early pandemic period, percentages of total EMS activations increased for on-scene death (from 1.3% to 2.4% during weeks 11-15), cardiac arrest (from 1.3% to 2.2% during weeks 11-15), and opioid use/overdose (from 0.6% to 1.1% during weeks 8-18); the percentages then declined, but remained above pre-pandemic levels through calendar week 52. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has indirect consequences, such as relative increases in EMS activations for cardiac events and opioid use/overdose, possibly linked to disruptions is healthcare access and health-seeking behaviors. Increasing telehealth visits or other opportunities for patient-provider touch points for chronic disease and substance use disorders that emphasize counseling, preventive care, and expanded access to medications can disrupt delayed care-seeking during the pandemic and potentially prevent premature death.","Handberry, Maya; Bull-Otterson, Lara; Dai, Mengtao; Mann, Clay N; Chaney, Eric; Ratto, Jeff; Horiuchi, Kalanthe; Siza, Charlene; Kulkarni, Aniket; Gundlapalli, Adi V; Boehmer, Tegan K",Clin. infect. dis,,470

215991,Experiences and attitudes of midwives during the birth of a pregnant woman with COVID-19 infection: A qualitative study,2020,"Chemosensation plays a role in the behaviors and life cycles of numerous organisms, including nematodes. Many guilds of nematodes exist-ranging from the free-living Caenorhabditis elegans to various parasitic species such as entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), which are parasites of insects. Despite ecological differences, previous research has shown that both EPNs and C. elegans respond to prenol (3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol), an odor associated with EPN-infections. However, it is unclear how C. elegans responds to prenol. By utilizing natural variation and genetic neuron ablation to investigate the response of C. elegans to prenol, we found that the AWC neurons are involved in the detection of prenol and that several genes (including dcap-1, dcap-2, and clec-39) influence response to this odorant. Furthermore, we identified that the response to prenol is mediated by the canonically proposed pathway required for other AWC-sensed attractants. However, upon testing genetically diverse isolates, we found that the response of some strains to prenol differed from their response to isoamyl alcohol (IAA), suggesting that the pathways mediating response to these two odorants may be genetically distinct. Further, evaluations leveraging natural variation and genome wide association revealed specific genes that influence nematode behavior and provide a foundation for future studies to better understand the role of prenol in nematode behavioral ecology.","Baiocchi, Tiffany; Anesko, Kyle; Mercado, Nathan; Park, Heenam; Kin, Kassandra; Strickhouser-Monzon, Brandon; Robles, Priscila; Bowman, Christian; Wang, Han; Sternberg, Paul W; Dillman, Adler R",Genetics,,470

More than half of the women (51.89%) presented some degree of psychological impact, 20 participants were classified as having a mild impact, 6 with moderated impact and 29 with severe impact. The psychological impact was more prominent in women in their third gestational trimester, 36.07% of these women presented a severe impact, 4.92% a moderated impact and 14.75% a mild impact. The IES-R questionnaire had a mean score of 35.62 in the group of contaminated patients, indicating a higher psychological impact in comparison with the mean score of 26.76 in the group of patients who were not contaminated by the vírus.Conclusion: It can be inferred that the pregnant women who were not contaminated by the Sars-Cov2 presented a lower psychological impact than those who were contaminated. In addition, patients with lower psychological impact did not miss their ultrasound exams. Furthermore, more than half of the women who participated in the study, whether they were contaminated or not, presented some degree of psychological impact.","Moreira Ramiro, Ana Carolina; Côrtes Ribeiro, Camila; Leles Vieira de Souza, Bruna; Santana Dos Passos, Fábio",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,470
220669,Towards an Open Medical School without Checkerboards during the COVID-19 Pandemic: How to Flexibly Self-Manage General Surgery Practices in Hospitals?,2021,"BACKGROUND: The National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) is currently recommended in the UK for the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients, but little is known about its ability to detect severe cases. We aimed to evaluate NEWS2 for the prediction of severe COVID-19 outcome and identify and validate a set of blood and physiological parameters routinely collected at hospital admission to improve upon the use of NEWS2 alone for medium-term risk stratification. METHODS: Training cohorts comprised 1276 patients admitted to King's College Hospital National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust with COVID-19 disease from 1 March to 30 April 2020. External validation cohorts included 6237 patients from five UK NHS Trusts (Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals, University Hospitals Southampton, University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, University College London Hospitals, University Hospitals Birmingham), one hospital in Norway (Oslo University Hospital), and two hospitals in Wuhan, China (Wuhan Sixth Hospital and Taikang Tongji Hospital). The outcome was severe COVID-19 disease (transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) or death) at 14 days after hospital admission. Age, physiological measures, blood biomarkers, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney diseases) measured at hospital admission were considered in the models. RESULTS: A baseline model of 'NEWS2 + age' had poor-to-moderate discrimination for severe COVID-19 infection at 14 days (area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in training cohort = 0.700, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.680, 0.722; Brier score = 0.192, 95% CI 0.186, 0.197). A supplemented model adding eight routinely collected blood and physiological parameters (supplemental oxygen flow rate, urea, age, oxygen saturation, C-reactive protein, estimated glomerular filtration rate, neutrophil count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) improved discrimination (AUC = 0.735; 95% CI 0.715, 0.757), and these improvements were replicated across seven UK and non-UK sites. However, there was evidence of miscalibration with the model tending to underestimate risks in most sites. CONCLUSIONS: NEWS2 score had poor-to-moderate discrimination for medium-term COVID-19 outcome which raises questions about its use as a screening tool at hospital admission. Risk stratification was improved by including readily available blood and physiological parameters measured at hospital admission, but there was evidence of miscalibration in external sites. This highlights the need for a better understanding of the use of early warning scores for COVID.","Carr, Ewan; Bendayan, Rebecca; Bean, Daniel; Stammers, Matt; Wang, Wenjuan; Zhang, Huayu; Searle, Thomas; Kraljevic, Zeljko; Shek, Anthony; Phan, Hang T T; Muruet, Walter; Gupta, Rishi K; Shinton, Anthony J; Wyatt, Mike; Shi, Ting; Zhang, Xin; Pickles, Andrew; Stahl, Daniel; Zakeri, Rosita; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; O039,; Gallagher, Kevin; Rogers, Matt; Folarin, Amos; Karwath, Andreas; Wickstrøm, Kristin E; Köhn-Luque, Alvaro; Slater, Luke; Cardoso, Victor Roth; Bourdeaux, Christopher; Holten, Aleksander Rygh; Ball, Simon; McWilliams, Chris; Roguski, Lukasz; Borca, Florina; Batchelor, James; Amundsen, Erik Koldberg; Wu, Xiaodong; Gkoutos, Georgios V; Sun, Jiaxing; Pinto, Ashwin; Guthrie, Bruce; Breen, Cormac; Douiri, Abdel; Wu, Honghan; Curcin, Vasa; Teo, James T; Shah, Ajay M; Dobson, Richard J B",BMC Med,,470

221506,Neurocognitive Profiles in Adolescence Predict Subsequent Anxiety Trajectories During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Murine coronavirus (CoV) is a beta-CoV that infects mice by binding to carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1. Intraperitoneal infection with the murine CoV strain JHM (JHMV) induces acute mild hepatitis in mice. While both innate and acquired immune responses play a significant role in the protection against murine CoV infection in mice, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and interferon-Î³ are essential for viral clearance in JHMV-induced hepatitis. In addition, CoVs are characterized by high diversity, caused by mutations, recombination, and gene gain/loss. 25V16G is an immune-escape JHMV variant, which lacks a dominant CTL epitope. By evading immune responses, 25V16G establishes persistent infections, leading to granulomatous serositis in interferon-Î³-deficient mice. These examples of CoV-associated pathogenesis in mice might provide useful information on other CoV infections, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Kyuwa, Shigeru; Sugiura, Yuki",J Vet Med Sci,,470

223060,The One-Two Punch of Delirium and Dementia During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, with 11,669,259 positive cases and 539,906 deaths globally as of July 8, 2020. The objective of the present study was to determine whether meteorological parameters and air quality affect the transmission of COVID-19, analogous to SARS. We captured data from 29 provinces, including numbers of COVID-19 cases, meteorological parameters, air quality and population flow data, between Jan 21, 2020 and Apr 3, 2020. To evaluate the transmissibility of COVID-19, the basic reproductive ratio (R0) was calculated with the maximum likelihood ""removal"" method, which is based on chain-binomial model, and the association between COVID-19 and air pollutants or meteorological parameters was estimated by correlation analyses. The mean estimated value of R0 was 1.79 ± 0.31 in 29 provinces, ranging from 1.08 to 2.45. The correlation between R0 and the mean relative humidity was positive, with coefficient of 0.370. In provinces with high flow, indicators such as carbon monoxide (CO) and 24-h average concentration of carbon monoxide (CO_24 h) were positively correlated with R0, while nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 24-h average concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2_24 h) and daily maximum temperature were inversely correlated to R0, with coefficients of 0.644, 0.661, -0.636, -0.657, -0.645, respectively. In provinces with medium flow, only the weather factors were correlated with R0, including mean/maximum/minimum air pressure and mean wind speed, with coefficients of -0.697, -0.697, -0.697 and -0.841, respectively. There was no correlation with R0 and meteorological parameters or air pollutants in provinces with low flow. Our findings suggest that higher ambient CO concentration is a risk factor for increased transmissibility of the novel coronavirus, while higher temperature and air pressure, and efficient ventilation reduce its transmissibility. The effect of meteorological parameters and air pollutants varies in different regions, and requires that these issues be considered in future modeling disease transmissibility.","Lin, Shaowei; Wei, Donghong; Sun, Yi; Chen, Kun; Yang, Le; Liu, Bang; Huang, Qing; Paoliello, Monica Maria Bastos; Li, Huangyuan; Wu, Siying",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,470

On March 13th, the Oncology Section was converted into a 22-inpatient bed coronavirus disease (COVID) Unit, and we reshaped our organisation to face the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, while maintaining oncological activities. METHODS: We tracked down (i) volumes of oncological activities (January 1st - March 31st, 2020 versus the same period of 2019), (ii) patients' and caregivers' perception and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in oncology health professionals and SARS-CoV-2 infection-related hospital admissions of ""active""' oncological patients. RESULTS: As compared with the same trimester in 2019, the overall reduction in total numbers of inpatient admissions, chemotherapy administrations and specialist visits in January-March 2020 was 8%, 6% and 3%, respectively; based on the weekly average of daily accesses, reduction in some of the oncological activities became statistically significant from week 11. The overall acceptance of adopted measures, as measured by targeted questionnaires administered to a sample of 241 outpatients, was high (>70%). Overall, 8 of 85 oncology health professionals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (all but one employed in the COVID Unit, no hospital admissions and no treatment required); among 471 patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 7 had an ""active""' oncological disease (2 died of infection-related complications). CONCLUSIONS: A slight, but statistically significant reduction in oncology activity was registered during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in Verona, Italy.

The aim of the present study was to assess initial data on the mental health burden of the German public during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Germany and collected complete datasets from 15 704 German residents aged 18 years and over. Besides demographics, generalized anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-2) and psychological distress (DT) were assessed. Furthermore, COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 and the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 were covered. RESULTS: Significantly increased symptoms were highly prevalent in all dimensions: generalized anxiety (44.9%), depression (14.3%), psychological distress (65.2%) and COVID-19-related fear (59%). Females and younger people reported higher mental burden. Trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 and the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 are negatively associated with mental health burden. However, the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 is positively associated with increased COVID-19-related fear. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of appropriate psychological interventions for those in need and the provision of transparency and comprehensible information are crucial during the current pandemic.","Bäuerle, Alexander; Teufel, Martin; Musche, Venja; Weismüller, Benjamin; Kohler, Hannah; Hetkamp, Madeleine; Dörrie, Nora; Schweda, Adam; Skoda, Eva-Maria",J Public Health (Oxf),,470

Understanding the reasons for COVID-19-related disparities among patients with asthma has important public health implications. OBJECTIVE: To determine factors contributing to health disparities in those with asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous survey was sent through social media to adult patients with asthma, and a separate survey was sent to physicians who provide asthma care. The patient survey addressed demographic information including socioeconomic status, asthma control, and attitudes/health behaviors during COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 1171 patients (10.1% minority individuals) and 225 physicians completed the survey. Minority patients were more likely to have been affected by COVID-19 (eg, became unemployed, lived in a community with high COVID-19 cases). They had worse asthma control (increased emergency visits for asthma, lower Asthma Control Test score), were more likely to live in urban areas, and had a lower household income. Initial differences in attitudes and health behaviors disappeared after controlling for baseline demographic features. Institutional racism was demonstrated by findings that minority individuals were less likely to have a primary care physician, had more trouble affording asthma medications due to COVID-19, and were more likely to have lost health insurance because of COVID-19, and that 25% of physicians found it more challenging to care for black individuals with asthma during COVID-19.

225229,An Italian multicenter analysis of emergency admissions and treatment of upper tract urolithiasis during the lockdown and reopening phases of the COVID-19 pandemic: Are we ready for a second wave of the outbreak?,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Trapezoidal fractures account for only 0.4% of all carpal bone fractures. Owing to their rarity, there is paucity in the literature regarding the clinical findings and treatment. This paper aims to summarize the current understanding of trapezoidal fractures and present a novel classification algorithm. METHODS: A diagnostic classification algorithm was created based on the known blood supply and ligamentous attachment of the trapezoid. The proposed treatment algorithm was then applied to trapezoidal fractures in the literature to validate the algorithm and determine whether patients received treatment that was in accordance. RESULTS: A total of 19 articles, representing 22 trapezoidal fractures were included, with two additional cases presented by the authors. Presenting symptoms were pain (nâ¯=â¯21) and swelling (nâ¯=â¯12). Diagnosis was made on CT in a majority of the time, 79.2% (nâ¯=â¯18). All outcomes were favorable with symptomatic resolution and full range of motion after treatment, except in four patients that had co-existing wrist injuries. When the algorithm was applied, 89.5% (nâ¯=â¯17) of the patients received treatment in accordance with the proposed algorithm and demonstrated good outcomes. In the remaining patients (nâ¯=â¯2) whose treatment differed, one had diminished grip strength and the other was lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Given a degree of clinical suspicion including a history of blunt trauma to the hand and persisting pain, trapezoidal fractures should remain on the differential when plain radiographs fail to identify any fracture. Operative treatment is suggested if there is any significant displacement, compromise of the dorsal surface, or breech of the trapezoidal ligaments causing possible dislocation.

Taking the data deposited in the GISAID database, we made predictions using the IEDB analysis resource (TepiTool) to gauge how variants in the SARS-CoV-2 genome may change peptide binding to the most frequent MHC-class I and -II alleles in Africa, Asia and Europe. We caracterized how a single mutation in the wildtype sequence of of SARS-CoV-2 could influence the peptide binding of SARS-CoV-2 variants to MHC class II, but not to MHC class I alleles. Assuming the ORF8 (L84S) mutation is biologically significant, selective pressure from MHC class II alleles may select for viral varients and subsequently shape the quality and quantity of cellular immune responses aginast SARS-CoV-2.

227725,The Scientists' Collective 10-point proposal for equitable and timeous access to COVID-19 vaccine in South Africa,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the acute COVID-19 pandemic, physical access to the University Medical Center Göttingen was restricted for students. For the first time at our dental school, theoretical knowledge was imparted to students via asynchronous online screencasts and discussed via synchronous video meetings only. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the acceptance and effectiveness of distance education as a new teaching format for theoretical knowledge within the preclinical course in Operative Dentistry (sixth semester of the undergraduate dental curriculum in Germany). METHODS: The phantom course comprised distance education (first phase, 11 weeks) and subsequent on-site practical demonstrations and training (second phase, 10 weeks). All theoretical knowledge was taught via online screencasts during distance education (except for the first week, 3 screencasts were uploaded per week resulting in a total of 30 screencasts). Until the end of the term, all students (N=33) were able to view the screencasts for an unlimited number of times. Theoretical knowledge was assessed in a summative examination after practical on-site teaching. Acceptance and effectiveness of the new curriculum and distance education were also measured based on an evaluation survey and students' self-perceived learning outcome, which was compared to the outcome from the two pre-COVID-19 terms. RESULTS: Each screencast was viewed by a mean of 24 (SD 3.3) students and accessed a mean of 5.6 (SD 1.2) times per user (ie, by students who accessed the respective screencast at least once). During distance education, the number of accesses showed a linear trend over time. During the practical training phase, screencast views declined and increased again prior to the examination. Screencasts covering topics in Cariology, Restorative Dentistry, and Preventive Dentistry were viewed by more students than screencasts covering topics in Endodontology or Periodontology (both P=.047). Examination items in Periodontology showed inferior results compared to the other topics (P<.001). Within the different topics, students' self-perceived learning outcome did not differ from that during the pre-COVID-19 terms. Although most students agreed that the presented screencasts contributed to their learning outcome, pre-COVID-19 term students more strongly felt that lectures significantly contributed to their learning outcome (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Screencasts showed high acceptance and effectiveness among the students but were not used as a learning tool by all students. However, students who viewed the screencasts accessed each screencast more frequently than they could have attended a conventional lecture. Screencast views were mostly due to intrinsic motivation.","Kanzow, Philipp; Krantz-Schäfers, Christiane; Hülsmann, Michael",JMIR Med Educ,,470

Social determinants of health are increasingly recognized as a driving force of health inequities. It is well established that food insecurity leads to adverse health outcomes outside of pregnancy such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and mental health problems. However, little is known about the impact of food insecurity during pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Food insecurity and other social determinants of health are rarely addressed as part of routine obstetric care. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has only exacerbated the crisis of food insecurity across the country, disproportionally affecting women as well as racial and ethnic minorities. Women's health providers should implement universal screening for maternal food insecurity and offer resources to women struggling to feed themselves and their families. Reducing maternal health inequities in the US includes recognizing and addressing food insecurity, along with other social determinants of health, and advocating for public policies that support and protect all women's right to healthy food during pregnancy.","Dolin, Cara D; Compher, Charlene C; Oh, Jinhee K; Durnwald, Celeste P",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,470

Readmissions were due to cardiac, respiratory, and musculoskeletal symptoms. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with increased readmission OR, 3.16 (95% CI: 1.01-9.88; p = 0.048). No significant difference was found between inflammatory markers or clinical outcomes during the index hospitalization among patients who were readmitted compared to those who were not. A significant number of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 may be readmitted.

It has led to the use of temporary isolation systems and less-then-optimum patient placement configurations because of inadequate number of isolation rooms, both of which can compromise provider safety. Three key elements require special attention to reduce the maximum and average aerosolized contaminant concentration exposure to a healthcare worker in any isolation system: flow rate; air changes per hour; and patient placement. This is important because concentration exposures of aerosolized contaminants to healthcare workers in hospitals using temporary isolation systems can reach levels 21-30 times greater than a properly engineered negative pressure isolation room. A working knowledge of these three elements can help create a safer environment for healthcare workers when isolation rooms are not available.","Silich, Bert A",West J Emerg Med,,470

Observations: A 63-year-old male was admitted in intensive care unit (ICU), seven days after the beginning of an influenza-like symptoms, to manage an acute respiratory syndrome related with SARS-CoV-2. Chest scan showed interstitial pneumonia with ""crazy paving"" patterns. At day 19, ocular examination at the patient's bed described petechias and tarsal hemorrhages, mucous filaments and tarsal pseudomembranous. Conjunctival scrapings and swabs did not identify any bacteria or virus. To our knowledge, we described the first case of pseudomembranous conjunctivitis in a COVID-19 patient. Conclusion and importance: Considering that SARS-CoV-2 is present in tears and conjunctival secretions, external ocular infections could be factors of infectious spreading.

Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.","Hoffmann, Markus; Kleine-Weber, Hannah; Schroeder, Simon; Krüger, Nadine; Herrler, Tanja; Erichsen, Sandra; Schiergens, Tobias S; Herrler, Georg; Wu, Nai-Huei; Nitsche, Andreas; Müller, Marcel A; Drosten, Christian; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Cell,,470

This has caused that the knowledge of the disease has been progressive and, therefore, the therapeutic decisions have been conditioned by this lack of knowledge on the one hand and by the therapeutic limitations on the other. Many published studies are methodologically weak and their conclusions, of limited value, have contributed to creating confusion on the therapeutic approach of the disease. In the present paper, we propose a therapeutic approach based on a new disease staging. The therapeutic approach is divided into two big sections: the pharmacological treatment for the phase of viral replication, cytokine storm or late respiratory events (which includes the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)) and the treatment of the respiratory failure In every stage, we discuss the pathophysiology and comment (accept or rule out) the pharmacological options according to the present evidence. Moreover, we indicate how respiratory failure should be treated. Some characteristics are based on the evidence found in the literature. Others are the result of my experience in other situations.","Domingo Ribas, Christian",Open Respir Med J,,470

Here, we demonstrate the use of the rapid affinity pair identification via directed selection (RAPIDS) method to discover multiple affinity pairs for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein), a biomarker of COVID-19, from in vitro libraries in 10 weeks. The pair with the highest biomarker sensitivity was then integrated into a 10-minute, vertical-flow cellulose paper test. Notably, the as-identified affinity proteins were compatible with a roll-to-roll printing process for large-scale manufacturing of tests. The test achieved 40 pM and 80 pM limits of detection in 1×PBS (mock swab) and saliva matrices spiked with cell-culture generated SARS-CoV-2 viruses and is also capable of detection of N-protein from characterized clinical swab samples. Hence, this work paves the way towards the mass production of cellulose paper-based assays which can address the shortages faced due to dependence on nitrocellulose and current manufacturing techniques. Further, the results reported herein indicate the promise of RAPIDS and engineered binder proteins for the timely and flexible development of clinically relevant diagnostic tests in response to emerging infectious diseases.","Seunghyeon, Kim Emma H.; Yee, Eric A.; Miller, Yining Hao Dousabel M.

Lead exposure was measured using Blood Lead Levels (BLL), which were divided into quartiles of exposure based on the distribution within the database. Allostatic load (AL), a variable representing chronic physiological stress, was operationalized using ten clinical markers. The geometric mean values for markers of liver injury of interest (a) Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), (b) Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), (c) Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), and (d) Gamma glutamyl-transferase (GGT) were explored in quartiles of lead exposure. Associations between AL and AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT among those exposed to lead were analyzed using linear regression models. In examining lead exposure in increasing quartiles, the geometric mean of the liver injury markers showed significant elevations as lead exposure levels increased. Simple linear regression revealed AL was positively associated with several markers of hepatic injury in all degrees of lead exposure. This study demonstrates the potential dangers of social and environmental exposures to liver health.","Obeng-Gyasi, Emmanuel",,,470

We report our initial experience in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke with LVO in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: All consecutive patients with COVID-19 with acute ischemic stroke due to LVO treated in our institution during the 6 first weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak were included. Baseline clinical and radiological findings, treatment, and short-term outcomes are reported. RESULTS: We identified 10 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated for an acute ischemic stroke due to LVO. Eight were men, with a median age of 59.5 years. Seven had none or mild symptoms of COVID-19 at stroke onset. Median time from COVID-19 symptoms to stroke onset was 6 days. All patients had brain imaging within 3 hours from symptoms onset. Five patients had multi-territory LVO. Five received intravenous alteplase. All patients had mechanical thrombectomy. Nine patients achieved successful recanalization (mTICI2B-3), none experienced early neurological improvement, 4 had early cerebral reocclusion, and a total of 6 patients (60%) died in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Best medical care including early intravenous thrombolysis, and successful and prompt recanalization achieved with mechanical thrombectomy, resulted in poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Although our results require further confirmation, a different pharmacological approach (antiplatelet or other) should be investigated to take in account inflammatory and coagulation disorders associated with COVID-19.","Escalard, Simon; Maïer, Benjamin; Redjem, Hocine; Delvoye, François; Hébert, Solène; Smajda, Stanislas; Ciccio, Gabriele; Desilles, Jean-Philippe; Mazighi, Mikael; Blanc, Raphael; Piotin, Michel",Stroke,,470
235469,Caring for a person with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study with family caregivers,2021,"There are outstanding evolutionary questions on the recent emergence of human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 including the role of reservoir species, the role of recombination and its time of divergence from animal viruses. We find that the sarbecoviruses-the viral subgenus containing SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-undergo frequent recombination and exhibit spatially structured genetic diversity on a regional scale in China. SARS-CoV-2 itself is not a recombinant of any sarbecoviruses detected to date, and its receptor-binding motif, important for specificity to human ACE2 receptors, appears to be an ancestral trait shared with bat viruses and not one acquired recently via recombination. To employ phylogenetic dating methods, recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods. Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were shown to be consistent for these three approaches and for two different prior specifications of evolutionary rates based on HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV. Divergence dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 1879-1999), 1969 (95% HPD: 1930-2000) and 1982 (95% HPD: 1948-2009), indicating that the lineage giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating unnoticed in bats for decades.","Boni, Maciej F; Lemey, Philippe; Jiang, Xiaowei; Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Perry, Blair W; Castoe, Todd A; Rambaut, Andrew; Robertson, David L",Nat Microbiol,,470

240933,"While Normal Life Is Halting, Aging Is Not: A Perspective Piece During the COVID-19 Pandemic",2020,"Introduction: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) encompasses two conditions, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are at highest thrombotic risk. The incidence of VTE in COVID-19 patients is not definitely established, with studies reporting an incidence rate of 25-27%. Discussion: As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, studies are reporting increased incidence of VTE in COVID-19 patients admitted in ICU. But there are not many studies reporting the incidence of DVT in non-ICU COVID-19 patients. Elevated levels of D-dimer indicate hypercoagulability, but it can also indicate inflammation. 68% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had elevated D-dimer levels. Thus, D-dimer level at the time of admission does not co-relate with the development of VTE or its related complications in COVID-19 patients. One study reported that out of the total number of non-ICU COVID-19 patients who had signs or symptoms suggestive of DVT, 50% were detected to be positive on compression ultrasound scan. While some studies and international guidelines recommend the administration of LMWH in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, some studies recommend that the physicians should closely monitor patients for development of signs and symptoms of DVT, and perform prompt diagnostic tests to aid early diagnosis and initiate anticoagulation. Hence, the treatment protocols vary widely across institutions, and the decision of thromboprophylaxis is also made on a case-by-case basis. Conclusion: Further studies are needed to establish the incidence of DVT in non-ICU patients, the predictive value of d-dimer levels to detect DVT risk, and an optimal therapeutic regimen of prophylactic anti-coagulant therapy in these patients.","Pothiawala, Sohil",Signa Vitae,,470

However, well choreographed dance movements are extremely complex to animate and would involve an expensive and tedious production process. In addition to the use of complex motion capture systems, it typically requires a collaborative effort between animators, dancers, and choreographers. We introduce a complete system for dance motion synthesis, which can generate complex and highly diverse dance sequences given an input music sequence. As motion capture data is limited for the range of dance motions and styles, we introduce a massive dance motion data set that is created from YouTube videos. We also present a novel two-stream motion transformer generative model, which can generate motion sequences with high flexibility. We also introduce new evaluation metrics for the quality of synthesized dance motions, and demonstrate that our system can outperform state-of-the-art methods. Our system provides high-quality animations suitable for large crowds for virtual concerts and can also be used as reference for professional animation pipelines. Most importantly, we show that vast online videos can be effective in training dance motion models.","Li, Jiaman; Yin, Yihang; Chu, Hang; Zhou, Yi; Wang, Tingwu; Fidler, Sanja; Li, Hao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08171v1.pdf,470

COVID-19 is characterized by wide epidemic, strong infectivity, rapid onset and critical condition. In the face of this epidemic, all parts of the country quickly set off a peak in the fight against COVID-19, but no effective drug for COVID-19 has been developed in the short term. Recently, many hospitals have combined traditional Chinese medicine with western medicine in treatment, and the clinical effect is remarkable, which proves the antiviral effect of traditional Chinese medicine. A large number of pharmacological and clinical studies have proved that the Chinese materia medica S. flavescens has significant antiviral effect. In this paper, the mechanism of anti-coronavirus effect of S. flavescens is expounded from multiple pathways, such as type I interferon, NF-κB signal pathway, ERK signal pathway, PI3K/Akt signal pathway and matrine alkaloids, etc. It is intended to provide reference for clinical treatment of coronavirus infection pneumonia and research and development of related drugs of S. flavescens.","Li, Zhen; Yu, Ke-Xian",Chin.

241567,The Effects of COVID 19 Pandemic on Neurosurgical Training in The United States,2020,"An important stage in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) life cycle is the binding of the spike (S) protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) host cell receptor. Therefore, to explore conserved features in spike protein dynamics and to identify potentially novel regions for drugging, we measured spike protein variability derived from 791 viral genomes and studied its properties by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The findings indicated that S2 subunit (heptad-repeat 1 (HR1), central helix (CH), and connector domain (CD) domains) showed low variability, low fluctuations in MD, and displayed a trimer cavity. By contrast, the receptor binding domain (RBD) domain, which is typically targeted in drug discovery programs, exhibits more sequence variability and flexibility. Interpretations from MD simulations suggest that the monomer form of spike protein is in constant motion showing transitions between an “up” and “down” state. In addition, the trimer cavity may function as a “bouncing spring” that may facilitate the homotrimer spike protein interactions with the ACE2 receptor. The feasibility of the trimer cavity as a potential drug target was examined by structure based virtual screening. Several hits were identified that have already been validated or suggested to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus in published cell models. In particular, the data suggest an action mechanism for molecules including Chitosan and macrolides such as the mTOR (mammalian target of Rapamycin) pathway inhibitor Rapamycin. These findings identify a novel small molecule binding-site formed by the spike protein oligomer, that might assist in future drug discovery programs aimed at targeting the coronavirus (CoV) family of viruses.","Kalathiya, Umesh; Padariya, Monikaben; Mayordomo, Marcos; Lisowska, Małgorzata; Nicholson, Judith; Singh, Ashita; Baginski, Maciej; Fahraeus, Robin; Carragher, Neil; Ball, Kathryn; Haas, Juergen; Daniels, Alison; Hupp, Ted R.; Alfaro, Javier Antonio",J.

241716,Ordinary care in extraordinary times,2020,"BACKGROUND: Zoonotic coronaviruses have emerged as a global threat by causing fatal respiratory infections. Given the lack of specific antiviral therapies, application of human convalescent plasma retaining neutralizing activity could be a viable therapeutic option that can bridge this gap. METHODS: We traced antibody responses and memory B cells in peripheral blood collected from 70 recovered MERS-CoV patients for three years after the 2015 outbreak in South Korea. We also used a mouse infection model to examine whether the neutralizing activity of collected sera could provide therapeutic benefit in vivo upon lethal MERS-CoV challenge. RESULTS: Anti-spike-specific IgG responses, including neutralizing activity and antibody-secreting memory B cells, persisted for up to 3 years, especially in MERS patients that suffered from severe pneumonia. Mean antibody titers gradually decreased annually by less than two fold. Levels of antibody responses were significantly correlated with fever duration, viral shedding periods, and maximum viral loads observed during infection periods. In a transgenic mice model challenged with lethal doses of MERS-CoV, a significant reduction in viral loads and enhanced survival was observed when therapeutically treated with human plasma retaining high neutralizing titer (> 1/5,000). However, this failed to reduce pulmonary pathogenesis, as revealed by pathological changes in lungs and initial weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: High titers of neutralizing activity are required for suppressive effect on the viral replication but may not be sufficient to reduce inflammatory lesions upon fatal infection. Therefore, immune sera with high neutralizing activity must be carefully selected for plasma therapy of zoonotic coronavirus infection.","Kim, Yeon-Sook; Aigerim, Abdimadiyeva; Park, Uni; Kim, Yuri; Park, Hyoree; Rhee, Ji-Young; Choi, Jae-Phil; Park, Wan Beom; Park, Sang Won; Kim, Yeonjae; Lim, Dong-Gyun; Choi, Ji-Yeob; Jeon, Yoon Kyung; Yang, Jeong-Sun; Lee, Joo-Yeon; Shin, Hyoung-Shik; Cho, Nam-Hyuk",Clin. infect. dis,,470

They account for a high proportion of nonelective length-of-stays in hospital. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increased demand to manage HG patients in an ambulatory setting. At Chelsea and Westminster prior to COVID-19, our ambulatory hyperemesis patients were treated through the gynaecology inpatient ward. An average of 70 patients a year were seen on this pathway with a minimum of three visits per patient. Due to COVID-19 we needed to adapt this Service to the stricter challenges of infection prevention through collaboration with our local Ambulatory Emergency Care (AEC). Method Our aim was to develop a Service to treat hyperemesis patients in a safe setting, while reducing patient footfall through our emergency department (ED) and maintaining gold-standard care. Results In partnership with AEC and ED, Gynaecology developed a new ambulatory hyperemesis pathway. The pathway centres around direct triage from ED;direct referrals from GPs and patients to AEC with gold standard care in the AEC setting. It has a clear focus on early initiation of treatment by AEC, improved patient experience but maintaining continuity and overall clinical leadership by gynaecology. Conclusion and Next Steps Our aim is to establish a continual improvement cycle which assures we deliver evidence-based, time-sensitive, patient-centred care. We will establish this through refinement of this working partnership;these form important foundations to 'Same Day Emergency Care' for hyperemesis and the fight against COVID-19.","Dave, A.; Ofili-Yebovi, D.; Cavill, S.",BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,,470

The governments alone cannot prevent the spread of this pandemic without creating a sensitive public opinion and cooperation. Therefore, this study analyzed the knowledge, behavior, and precautionary measures taken by the general public to protect themselves from COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: For this purpose, snowball sampling technique was used to collect data from 401 respondents through an online survey in the Punjab province of Pakistan. A Multivariate Probit Model was used to determine the factors affecting the choice of precautionary measures to avoid COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Majority of the respondents (58.1%) belonged to urban areas in this study. The urban respondents had higher knowledge about Coronavirus disease as compared to rural respondents. Similarly, the hygienic behavior of urban respondents was better than rural respondents. But unavailability of hygienic material (mask and hand sanitizer) was the main problem faced by the general public. Public transportation was considered the most risk-prone place to COVID-19 by the respondents. Majority of the respondents perceived medium to highest risk from COVID-19, and it was found one of the most influential factors affecting the adoption of precautionary measures along with knowledge of this pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Government needs to start a comprehensive awareness campaign on social media along with the mainstream media create awareness about the importance of social distancing, washing hands and wearing masks among the general public to enhance knowledge and improve the behavior of the general public about COVID-19.","Haq, Shamsheer Ul; Shahbaz, Pomi; Boz, Ismet",J Infect Dev Ctries,,470

247634,To contrast and reverse skeletal muscle weakness by Full-Body In-Bed Gym in chronic COVID-19 pandemic syndrome,2021,"Deep learning methods have already enjoyed an unprecedented success in medical imaging problems. Similar success has been evidenced when it comes to the detection of COVID-19 from medical images, therefore deep learning approaches are considered good candidates for detecting this disease, in collaboration with radiologists and/or physicians. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect COVID-19 via exploiting a conditional generative adversarial network to generate synthetic images for augmenting the limited amount of data available. Additionally, we propose two deep learning models following a lightweight architecture, commensurating with the overall amount of data available. Our experiments focused on both binary classification for COVID-19 vs Normal cases and multi-classification that includes a third class for bacterial pneumonia. Our models achieved a competitive performance compared to other studies in literature and also a ResNet8 model. Our best performing binary model achieved 98.7% accuracy, 100% sensitivity and 98.3% specificity, while our three-class model achieved 98.3% accuracy, 99.3% sensitivity and 98.1% specificity. Moreover, via adopting a testing protocol proposed in literature, our models proved to be more robust and reliable in COVID-19 detection than a baseline ResNet8, making them good candidates for detecting COVID-19 from posteroanterior chest X-ray images.","Karakanis, Stefanos; Leontidis, Georgios",Comput Biol Med,,470

The behavior of the virus and its full clinical picture has not been fully studied yet. Many case reports and case series have been running in order to elaborate different presentations and associations. Pulmonary and gastrointestinal features of COVID-19 infection are well outlined;however, neurological manifestations are less defined. Case presentation We report two adult cases of COVID-19 infection presented with acute Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), and a literature review on the causal association between COVID-19 and GBS. Conclusion Our two case reports in addition to literature review of 116 published cases may help offer insight into the clinical course of COVID-19 infection. Our two COVID-19 patients presented with neurological manifestations of GBS which were not preceded with any respiratory, gastrointestinal or other systemic infection. This leads us to raise the possibility of establish direct causal association between COVID-19 infection and GBS. Physicians should have high clinical suspicions when encounter GBS patient during the current COVID-19 pandemic and consider co-existence of COVID-19 infection that may warrant SARS-CoV-2 testing, isolation precautions, and specific treatment for Covid-19 infection.","Elzouki, Abdel-Naser Osman Maab A.

249129,Understanding physicians' preferences for telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Aim To identify laboratory tests for early detection and the development of more severe illness and death in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Methods A prospective study was done on 66 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (males: 54.5%; mean age 70.1 ± 9.6 years) who were stratified into: moderate (n=36; 54.5%), severe (n=12; 18.2%), and critically ill (n=18; 27.3%). Besides clinical findings, a wide spectrum of laboratory parameters was monitored at admission and control during the first seven days of hospitalization and used to predict progression from non-severe to severe illness and to predict the final outcome. Results Critically ill patients showed a higher control value of white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, but lower lymphocyte count and O2 saturation. Patients with fatal outcome (23; 34.85%) showed a higher control value of neutrophil, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and lower lymphocyte and O2 saturation. Progression from moderate to severe or critical illness was predicted by increasing lactate dehydrogenase (95% CI 0.5803 to 0.8397;p=0.003729), increase in ferritin (95% CI 0.5288 to 0.8221;p=0.03248), and by drop in O2 saturation (95% CI 0.5498 to 0.8179;p=0.01168). A fatal outcome was predicted by increase in ferritin (95% CI 0.5059 to 0.8195;p=0.04985), as well as by drop in O2 saturation (95% CI 0.5916 to 0.8803; p=0.001861). Conclusion Increase in ferritin, and drop in O2 saturation could be the most important prognostic parameters for the development of more severe clinical illness and death in COVID-19 hospitalized patients.","Mustafic, Sehveta; Jusufovic, Edin; Hukic, Fatima; Trnacevic, Emir; Divkovic, Anja; Trnacevic, Alma",,,470
249495,Hardware versus heartware: The need to address psychological well-being among operating room staff during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain tumor of the central nervous system in adults. Despite advances in surgical and medical neuro-oncology, the median survival is about 15 months. For this reason, initial diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted therapy of GBM represent very attractive areas of study. Aptamers are short three-dimensional structures of single-stranded nucleic acids (RNA or DNA), identified by an in vitro process, named systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), starting from a partially random oligonucleotide library. They bind to a molecular target with high affinity and specificity and can be easily modified to optimize binding affinity and selectivity. Thanks to their properties (low immunogenicity and toxicity, long stability, and low production variability), a large number of aptamers have been selected against GBM biomarkers and provide specific imaging agents and therapeutics to improve the diagnosis and treatment of GBM. However, the use of aptamers in GBM diagnosis and treatment still represents an underdeveloped topic, mainly due to limited literature in the research world. On these bases, we performed a systematic review aimed at summarizing current knowledge on the new promising DNA and RNA aptamer-based molecules for GBM diagnosis and treatment. Thirty-eight studies from 2000 were included and investigated. Seventeen involved the use of aptamers for GBM diagnosis and 21 for GBM therapy. Our findings showed that a number of DNA and RNA aptamers are promising diagnostic and therapeutic tools for GBM management.","Nuzzo, Silvia; Brancato, Valentina; Affinito, Alessandra; Salvatore, Marco; Cavaliere, Carlo; Condorelli, Gerolama",,,470

However, current art-making robots are typically either contingent, controlled as a tool by a human artist, or creative, programmed to paint independently, possibly because some complex and idiosyncratic concepts related to art, such as emotion and creativity, are not yet well understood. For example, the role of personalized taste in forming beauty evaluations has been studied in empirical aesthetics, but how to generate art that appears to an individual to express certain emotions such as happiness or sadness is less clear. In the current article, a collaborative prototyping/Wizard of Oz approach was used to explore generic robot art-making strategies and personalization of art via an open-ended emotion profile intended to identify tricky concepts. As a result of conducting an exploratory user study, participants indicated some preference for a robot art-making strategy involving""visual metaphors""to balance exogenous and endogenous components, and personalized representational sketches were reported to convey emotion more clearly than generic sketches. The article closes by discussing personalized abstract art as well as suggestions for richer art-making strategies and user models. Thus, the main conceptual advance of the current work lies in suggesting how an interactive robot can visually express emotions through personalized art; the general aim is that this could help to inform next steps in this promising area and facilitate technological acceptance of robots in everyday human environments.","Cooney, Martin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05084v1.pdf,470

Uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to trigger mental health problems, which include anxiety, stress, and depression. This paper evaluates the prevalence, psychological responses, and associated correlates of depression, anxiety, and stress in a global population during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. A cross-sectional study design was adopted. 678 completed forms were collected during the COVID-19 quarantine/lockdown. An online questionnaire was designed and DASS-21 was used as the screening tool. A non-probability sampling technique strategy was applied. 50.9% of participants showed traits of anxiety, 57.4% showed signs of stress, and 58.6% exhibited depression. Stress, anxiety, and depression are overwhelmingly prevalent across the globe during this COVID-19 pandemic, and multiple factors can influence the rates of these mental health conditions. Our factorial analysis showed notable associations and manifestations of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. People aged 18-24, females, and people in non-marital relationships experienced stress, anxiety, and depression. Separated individuals experienced stress and anxiety. Married people experienced anxiety. Single and divorced people experienced depression. Unemployed individuals experienced stress and depression. Students experienced anxiety and depression. Canada, the UK, and Pakistan are all countries that are experiencing stress and depression as a whole. An extended number of days in quarantine was associated with increased stress, anxiety, and depression. Family presence yielded lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Lastly, lack of exercise was associated with increased stress, anxiety, and depression.","Shah, Syed Mustafa Ali; Mohammad, Danish; Qureshi, Muhammad Fazal Hussain; Abbas, Mohammad Zain; Aleem, Sameeha",Community ment. health j,,470

From a recovered SARS-CoV donor sample, we identify and characterize a panel of six monoclonal antibodies that cross-react with CoV spike (S) proteins from the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and demonstrate a spectrum of reactivity against other CoV. Epitope mapping reveals that these antibodies recognize multiple epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 S, including the receptor binding domain, N-terminal domain, and S2 subunit. Functional characterization demonstrates that the antibodies mediate phagocytosis - and in some cases trogocytosis - but not neutralization in vitro. When tested in vivo in murine models, two of the antibodies demonstrate a reduction in hemorrhagic pathology in the lungs. The identification of cross-reactive epitopes recognized by functional antibodies expands the repertoire of targets for pan-coronavirus vaccine design strategies.","Shiakolas, Andrea R; Kramer, Kevin J; Wrapp, Daniel; Richardson, Simone I; Schäfer, Alexandra; Wall, Steven; Wang, Nianshuang; Janowska, Katarzyna; Pilewski, Kelsey A; Venkat, Rohit; Parks, Robert; Manamela, Nelia P; Raju, Nagarajan; Fechter, Emilee Friedman; Holt, Clinton M; Suryadevara, Naveenchandra; Chen, Rita E; Martinez, David R; Nargi, Rachel S; Sutton, Rachel E; Ledgerwood, Julie E; Graham, Barney S; Diamond, Michael S; Haynes, Barton F; Acharya, Priyamvada; Carnahan, Robert H; Crowe, James E; Baric, Ralph S; Morris, Lynn; McLellan, Jason S; Georgiev, Ivelin S",Cell Rep Med,,470

At this time, diagnosis is based on the positivity of specific RT-PCR and/or chest computed tomography scan, which are time-consuming and may delay diagnosis. Complete blood count (CBC) can potentially contribute to the diagnosis of COVID-19. We studied whether the analysis of cellular population data (CPD), provided as part of CBC-Diff analysis by the DxH 800 analyzers (Beckman Coulter), can help to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Cellular population data of the different leukocyte subpopulations were analyzed in 137 controls, 322 patients with proven COVID-19 (COVID+), and 285 patients for whom investigations were negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-). When CPD of COVID+ were different from controls and COVID- patients, we used receiver operating characteristic analysis to test the discriminating capacity of the individual parameters. Using a random forest classifier, we developed the algorithm based on the combination of 4 monocyte CPD to discriminate COVID+ from COVID- patients. This algorithm was tested prospectively in a series of 222 patients referred to the emergency unit. RESULTS: Among the 222 patients, 86 were diagnosed as COVID-19 and 60.5% were correctly identified using the discriminating protocol. Among the 136 COVID- patients, 10.3% were misclassified (specificity 89.7%, sensitivity 60.5%). False negatives were observed mainly in patients with a low inflammatory state whereas false positives were mainly seen in patients with sepsis. CONCLUSION: Consideration of CPD could constitute a first step and potentially aid in the early diagnosis of COVID-19.","Vasse, Marc; Ballester, Marie-Christine; Ayaka, Degnile; Sukhachev, Dmitry; Delcominette, Frédérique; Habarou, Florence; Jolly, Emilie; Sukhacheva, Elena; Pascreau, Tiffany; Farfour, Éric",Int. j. lab. hematol,,470

Fortunately, with the recent development and widespread deployment of small-scale manufacturing technologies like RepRap-class 3-D printers and open source microcontrollers, mass distributed manufacturing of ventilators has the potential to overcome medical supply shortages. In this study, after providing a background on ventilators, the academic literature is reviewed to find the existing and already openly-published, vetted designs for ventilators systems. These articles are analyzed to determine if the designs are open source both in spirit (license) as well as practical details (e.g. possessing accessible design source files, bill of materials, assembly instructions, wiring diagrams, firmware and software as well as operation and calibration instructions). Next, the existing Internet and gray literature are reviewed for open source ventilator projects and designs. The results of this review found that the tested and peer-reviewed systems lacked complete documentation and the open systems that were documented were either at the very early stages of design (sometimes without even a prototype) and were essentially only basically tested (if at all). With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed these projects will garner greater attention and resources to make significant progress to reach a functional and easily-replicated system. There is a large amount of future work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level considered scientific-grade equipment, and even further work needed to reach medical-grade hardware. Future work is needed to achieve the potential of this approach by developing policies, updating regulations, and securing funding mechanisms for the development and testing of open source ventilators for both the current COVID19 pandemic as well as for future pandemics and for everyday use in low-resource settings.","Pearce, Joshua M",F1000Res,,470

Pertaining to its high transmissibility and wide host adaptability, this unique human coronavirus spread across the planet inflicting 115 million people and causing 2.5 million deaths (as of March 3rd, 2021). Limited or negligible pre-existing immunity to multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants has resulted in severe morbidity and mortality worldwide, as well as a record-breaking surge in the use of medical-surgical supplies and personal protective equipment. In response to the global need for effective sterilization techniques, this study evaluated the virucidal efficacy of FATHHOME's self-contained, ozone-based dry-sanitizing device, by dose and time response assessment. We tested inactivation of human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, a close genetic model of SARS-CoV-2, on porous (N95 filtering facepiece respirator/FFR) and nonporous (glass) surfaces. We started our assays with 20 ppm-10 min ozone exposure, and effectively reduced 99.8% and 99.9% of virus from glass and N95 FFR surfaces, respectively. Importantly, the virus was completely inactivated, below the detection limit (over 6-log10 reduction) with 25 ppm-15 min ozone exposure on both tested surfaces. As expected, a higher ozone exposure (50 ppm-10 min) resulted in faster inactivation of HCoV-OC43 with 100% inactivation from both the surfaces, with no residual ozone present after completion of the 5-min post exposure recapture cycle and no measurable increase in ambient ozone levels. These results confirmed that FATHHOME's device is suitable for rapid decontamination of SARS-CoV-2- from worn items, frequently touched items, and PPE including N95 FFRs, face shields, and other personal items.","Uppal, Timsy; Khazaieli, Amir; Snijders, Antoine M; Verma, Subhash C",,,470

To do so, we compute upside and downside correlations between the two markets. Our findings are as follows. First, we document the correlation asymmetry: the downside correlation is higher than the upside correlation. Second, we find that both upside and downside correlations increased after the crisis. This indicates that after the start of the Covid-19 crisis, a positive (negative) oil shock is even better (worse) news for the stock market than an equivalent shock before the crisis.","Sakurai, Yuji; Kurosaki, Testuo",Financ Res Lett,,470
255114,COVID-19: The need for screening for domestic violence and related neurocognitive problems,2020,"Cross-regional governance of government often faces various problems, which often brings great loss to the society. The global outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in early 2020 has not only caused serious economic and social losses to various countries but also put the current public health event governance system to a severe test. The cross-regional character and spillover effects of public health outbreak governance often make it difficult to coordinate cross-regional governance. In this context, this paper adopts a regional evolutionary game analysis framework and studies the cross-regional governance of public health emergencies by constructing a symmetric game of peripheral regions and an asymmetric game of core-peripheral regions. The marginal contribution of this paper is to attempt to construct a symmetric game model for peripheral regions and an asymmetric game model for core and peripheral regions using an evolutionary game approach to study the behavioral strategies of multiple regions in the governance of public health emergencies, and it is found that when the regional spillover effects and governance costs are small or the economic and social damages caused by public health emergencies are large, all regions will choose to conduct coordinated governance. Otherwise, there will be regions that choose to ""free-ride."" This ""free-rider"" mentality has led to the failure in achieving good cross-regional collaborative governance of public health emergencies, resulting in a lack of efficiency in the overall governance of public health in society. However, when the spillover effect of regional governance exceeds a certain critical value, the result of the regional governance game is also the socially optimal result, when public health emergencies are effectively governed. At the same time, the relevant findings and analytical framework of this paper will provide a policy reference for the cross-regional governance of the current new crown epidemic.

Therapists may be hesitant in moving to telehealth when delivering therapies targeting memories of traumatic experiences. This paper collates the clinical experiences of clinicians and clients who have delivered or received imagery rescripting, respectively, via telehealth across a range of clinical presentations, and describes key clinical considerations and recommendations. RECENT FINDINGS: It is important to consider perceived and real safety; practical and technological issues; therapeutic alliance; depth of emotional processing; and dissociation. There was support for the delivery of imagery rescripting via telehealth being no less effective than face-to-face delivery; however, telehealth delivery was not a viable option for many clients during COVID-19 lockdowns who were living in high density housing, old houses with thin walls, or with some complex disorders.","Paulik, Georgie; Maloney, Gayle; Arntz, Arnoud; Bachrach, Nathan; Koppeschaar, Annemieke; McEvoy, Peter",Curr Psychiatry Rep,,470

257145,Post-lockdown challenges for ophthalmologists during COVID-19 pandemic in India: A survey-based analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Behavioural aspects of chewing may influence food intake, nutritional status and in turn body weight. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to study chewing features in adolescents as they naturally occur in home-based settings, and to test for a possible association with weight status. METHODS: Forty-two adolescents (15.3 ± 1.3 years) were recruited (21 with healthy-weight/21 with overweight). Using a smartphone-assisted wearable electromyographic device, the chewing features of each participant were assessed over one evening, including the evening meal, in their natural home setting. RESULTS: The mean (±SD) for chewing pace was 1.53 ± 0.22 Hz, chewing power 30.1% ± 4.8%, number of chewing episodes 63.1 ± 36.7 and chewing time 11.0 ± 7.7 minutes. The chewing pace of the group with overweight was slower than that of healthy weight (-0.20 Hz; 95% CI, -0.06 to -0.33; P = .005) while their chewing time was shorter (-4.9 minutes; 95% CI, 0.2-9.7; P = .044). A significant negative correlation was observed between BMI z-score and chewing pace (R = -.41; P = .007), and between BMI z-score and chewing time (R = -0.32; P = .039). CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that adolescents who are overweight eat at a slower pace for a shorter period of time than their counterparts who are a healthy weight. This unexpected finding based on objective data appears to conflict with existing questionnaire findings but provides impetus for further work testing the effectiveness of changing eating behaviour as a weight-management intervention in youth.","Idris, Ghassan; Smith, Claire; Galland, Barbara; Taylor, Rachael; Robertson, Christopher J; Bennani, Hamza; Farella, Mauro",Pediatr Obes,,470

Some of these variables pertain to policy measures such as social distancing, quarantines for specific areas, and testing availability. In this paper, I analyze the effect that lockdown and testing policies had on new contagions in Chile, especially focusing on potential heterogeneity given by population characteristics. Leveraging a natural experiment in the determination of early quarantines, I use an Augmented Synthetic Control Method to build counterfactuals for high and lower-income areas that experienced a lockdown during the first two months of the pandemic. I find substantial differences in the impact that quarantine policies had for different populations: While lockdowns were effective in containing and reducing new cases of COVID-19 in higher-income municipalities, I find no significant effect of this measure for lower-income areas. To further explain these results, I test for difference in mobility during quarantine for high and lower-income municipalities, as well as delays in test results and testing availability. These findings are consistent with previous results, showing that differences in the effectiveness of lockdowns could be partially attributed to heterogeneity in quarantine compliance in terms of mobility, as well as differential testing availability for higher and lower-income areas.","Bennett, Magdalena",World Dev,,470
258859,A87 Healthcare Provider Satisfaction with Virtual Care Delivery in Alberta during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) has reached pandemic status and is affecting countries all over the world. The COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied by various stressors that require adjustment in everyday life and possibly changes in personal future prospects. While some individuals cope well with these challenges, some develop psychological distress including depressive symptoms, anxiety, or stress. Internet-based self-help interventions have proven to be effective in the treatment of various mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. Based on that, we developed an internet-based self-help program for individuals with psychological distress due to the situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The 3-week self-help program consists of 6 modules comprising texts, videos, figures, and exercises. Participants can request guidance within the self-help program (guidance on demand). The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of the self-help program compared to a waiting control condition. METHODS: The design is a parallel group randomized controlled trial. Participants are allocated to a 3-week self-help intervention plus care as usual or a 3-week waiting period with only care as usual. There are follow-ups after 6 weeks and 18 weeks. At least 80 participants with COVID-19 pandemic related psychological distress will be recruited. Primary outcome are depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes include anxiety and chronic stress, suicidal experiences and behavior, health-related quality of life, generalized optimism and pessimism, embitterment, optimistic self-beliefs, emotion regulation skills, loneliness, resilience, and the satisfaction with and usability of the self-help program. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies investigating the efficacy of an internet-based self-help program for psychological distress due to the situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the results of this study may give further insight into the use of internet-based self-help programs in pandemic-related psychological distress.

258870,Preventing problematic internet use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Consensus guidance,2020,"Secure updating and sharing for large amounts of healthcare information (such as medical data on coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) in efficient and secure transmission are important but challenging in communication channels amongst hospitals. In particular, in addressing the above challenges, two issues are faced, namely, those related to confidentiality and integrity of their health data and to network failure that may cause concerns about data availability. To the authors' knowledge, no study provides secure updating and sharing solution for large amounts of healthcare information in communication channels amongst hospitals. Therefore, this study proposes and discusses a novel steganography-based blockchain method in the spatial domain as a solution. The novelty of the proposed method is the removal and addition of new particles in the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm. In addition, hash function can hide secret medical COVID-19 data in hospital databases whilst providing confidentiality with high embedding capacity and high image quality. Moreover, stego images with hash data and blockchain technology are used in updating and sharing medical COVID-19 data between hospitals in the network to improve the level of confidentiality and protect the integrity of medical COVID-19 data in grey-scale images, achieve data availability if any connection failure occurs in a single point of the network and eliminate the central point (third party) in the network during transmission. The proposed method is discussed in three stages. Firstly, the pre-hiding stage estimates the embedding capacity of each host image. Secondly, the secret COVID-19 data hiding stage uses PSO algorithm and hash function. Thirdly, the transmission stage transfers the stego images based on blockchain technology and updates all nodes (hospitals) in the network. As proof of concept for the case study, the authors adopted the latest COVID-19 research published in the Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine journal, which presents a rescue framework within hospitals for the storage and transfusion of the best convalescent plasma to the most critical patients with COVID-19 on the basis of biological requirements. The validation and evaluation of the proposed method are discussed.","Mohsin, A H; Zaidan, A A; Zaidan, B B; Mohammed, K I; Albahri, O S; Albahri, A S; Alsalem, M A",Multimed Tools Appl,,470

260525,"Noise measurements as a proxy to evaluating the response to recommendations in times of crisis: An update analysis of the transition to the second wave of the CoViD-19 pandemic in Central Stockholm, Sweden",2021,"Lifestyle Medicine (LM) is defined as the evidence-based clinical practice focused on behavioral changes to promote health and reverse lifestyle related chronic illnesses. Although LM is increasingly being added to graduate medical education, its incorporation into undergraduate health professional education is limited. The evidence showing the effect of lifestyle related comorbid illnesses on COVID-19 mortality heightens the importance of incorporating LM into health professional education now more than ever. The goal of this project was to introduce undergraduate nursing students to LM through the addition of an experiential lifestyle modification assignment into a human physiology course. Students were instructed to select a lifestyle modification goal, implement, and track their progress meeting this goal for a two-week period, and submit a reflection of this experience including a table/graph of their data. We hypothesized that completion of this assignment would enhance student's learning of physiology. Following IRB approval, students were requested to complete a survey and allow use of their assignment for this educational research study. This survey included questions to assess demographic information, student perception of the assignment and a validated self-efficacy questionnaire. Of the 125 students who completed the assignment, 53 completed the survey and 50 agreed to allow analysis of their assignment for the study. Most participants were female (89%), not currently caring for children (80%), single (77%), unemployed (66%), white (56%) and under 24 years of age (53%). Exercise was the most frequently selected category of lifestyle modification goals followed by nutrition, stress reduction, sleep, and avoidance of risky substances. Almost all students reported that this activity enhanced their learning of physiology (97%) with a trend of higher ratings of the effect of this activity on learning of physiology for students under 24 years of age compared to students 24 and older, although this difference was not significant. Similarly, most students reported that completing a chart of their data and summarizing this data helped them learn how to interpret and analyze data (94%) with significantly higher ratings of this effect for younger students (P &lt; 0.05). Self-efficacy scores were not significantly different between age groups with an overall score of 35.5 ± 4.6 (Scale 0-40, higher score-greater self-efficacy). Interestingly, stress reduction was a common physiological impact reported by students across all categories of lifestyle modification. Results of this study suggest that undergraduate nursing student's experience with implementing their own lifestyle modification reinforces learning of physiology with the added benefit of promoting student wellness. Given the ongoing data indicating the negative impact of COVID-19 on student mental health, the potential benefit of a lifestyle modification assignment on student wellness is arguably as important as its impact on physiological education.","Basha, Maureen Morales Nanette Rigterink Kristina Harrison-Bernard Lisa Harris David Gunaldo Tina",The FASEB Journal,,470

261636,Biopsychosocial Processes of Health and Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic causes vital concerns due to the lack of proved, effective, and safe therapy. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine seem to be useful, but recently serious concerns regarding their adverse events have risen. The aim of the study was to broaden the general perspective of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use in COVID-19 treatment, based on an analysis of their current safety profile among patients with rheumatic diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was based on a group of 152 patients with rheumatic diseases, aged 20-78 years, treated either with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Analyzed data included age, gender, comorbidities, type of drug, dosage, treatment duration, and reported adverse events. Cases of drug withdrawal related to adverse events were also recorded. RESULTS: The dosage was consistent in both groups: 250 mg of chloroquine or 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily. 77.6% of patients did not experience any adverse reactions to the treatment. Hydroxychloroquine showed better safety profile, with 10.9% of patients reporting side-ffects, compared to 28.9% in patients treated with chloroquine. The overall incidence of ophthalmic complications was 6.6%. For both drugs, no statistically significant correlation between adverse events and age, chronic heart or liver disease, or hypertension was found. CONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine at lower doses, as used in rheumatic diseases, prove to be relatively safe.

This review sought to determine the potential role of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5) in the management of COVID-19 by extrapolating relevant data and clinical studies from other related disease states, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury, and high altitude pulmonary edema. Following a literature search, 4 reports were analyzed and included in this review. While the heterogenicity of data and the small number of trials included limit the interpretation and applicability, it was consistently demonstrated that PDE-5 inhibitors lowered pulmonary arterial pressures. The overall benefit of these agents is seemingly dependent upon the etiology of the respiratory failure, which warrants expanded clinical investigation for COVID-19.","Reinert, Justin P; Reinert, Nathan J",J Intensive Care Med,,470

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey sent to healthcare practitioners working in various hospitals and community pharmacies. Demographic, professional and psychological characteristics (distress using Kessler-6 questionnaire, anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep issues, exhaustion) were measured as were sources of fear. Descriptive and multivariable statistics were performed using level of distress as the outcome. RESULTS: We surveyed 937 practitioners (56.1% females). Approximately 68%, 14%, and 18% were nurses/technicians, physicians, and pharmacists (respectively). 32% suffered from high distress while 20% suffered from severe distress. Exhaustion, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances were reported (in past seven days) by approximately 34%, 34%, 19%, and 29% of subjects (respectively). Being older or male, a positive perception of communications with peers, and being satisfied at work, were significantly associated with lower distress. Conversely, suffering burnout; reporting sleep-related functional problems; exhaustion; being a pharmacist (relative to a physician); working in a cancer center; harboring fear about virus spreading; fear that the virus threatened life; fear of alienation from family/friends; and fear of workload increases, were significantly associated with higher distress. CONCLUSION: Despite low caseloads, Jordanian practitioners still experienced high levels of distress. Identified demographic, professional and psychological factors influencing distress should inform interventions to improve medical professionals' resilience and distress likelihood, regardless of the variable Covid-19 situation.","Hawari, Feras I; Obeidat, Nour A; Dodin, Yasmeen I; Albtoosh, Asma S; Manasrah, Rasha M; Alaqeel, Ibrahim O; Mansour, Asem H",PLoS One,,470

Serological assays are used to diagnose MERS-CoV infection and to screen for serum antibodies in seroepidemiological studies. The conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the preferred tool for detecting serum antibodies specific for pathogens; however, the utility of conventional ELISA with respect to detection of MERS-CoV antibodies is limited due to the number of false-positives caused by cross-reactivity of serum antibodies with antigens that are conserved among coronaviruses. The competitive ELISA (cELISA) uses a pathogen-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) that competes with serum antibodies for binding to an antigen; therefore, it is used widely for serological surveillance of many pathogens. In this chapter, I describe detection of serum antibodies using cELISA based on MAbs specific for MERS-CoV.","Fukushi, Shuetsu",Methods Mol Biol,,470

This article presents a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to ascertain if methylprednisolone can be recommended for use in patients with COVID-19 to prevent deaths. METHODS: Systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and preprint servers until 13th April 2021. The outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. The random-effects model for the meta-analysis was utilized to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) at 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Five RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled OR for all-cause mortality was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.29 -1.43, n=652) comparing methylprednisolone with the control, indicating no mortality benefits. A similar finding was noted with a sub-group analysis including four trials that used low-dose methylprednisolone. However, the only trial that administered high doses of methylprednisolone indicated a statistically significant mortality benefit (OR 0.08, 95% CI: 0.02-0.42). CONCLUSIONS: A short duration (3 to 5 days) pulse therapy of high-dose methylprednisolone can be a promising alternative to the low-dose dexamethasone therapy in severely ill patients with COVID-19 to prevent deaths.","Hasan, Syed Shahzad; Kow, Chia Siang; Mustafa, Zia Ul; Merchant, Hamid A",Expert rev. respir. med,,470

267705,Electroconvulsive therapy services during COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Papain-Like Protease (PLpro) is a key protein for SARS-CoV-2 viral replication which is the cause of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. Targeting PLpro can suppress viral replication and provide treatment options for COVID-19. Due to the dynamic nature of its binding site loop, PLpro multiple conformations were generated through a long-range 1 micro-second molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Clustering the MD trajectory enabled us to extract representative structures for the conformational space generated. Adding to the MD representative structures, X-ray structures were involved in an ensemble docking approach to screen the FDA approved drugs for a drug repositioning endeavor. Guided by our recent benchmarking study of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, FRED docking software was selected for such a virtual screening task. The results highlighted potential consensus binders to many of the MD clusters as well as the newly introduced X-ray structure of PLpro complexed with a small molecule. For instance, three drugs Benserazide, Dobutamine and Masoprocol showed a superior consensus enrichment against the PLpro conformations. Further MD simulations for these drugs complexed with PLpro suggested the superior stability and binding of dobutamine and masoprocol inside the binding site compared to Benserazide. Generally, this approach can facilitate identifying drugs for repositioning via targeting multiple conformations of a crucial target for the rapidly emerging COVID-19 pandemic.","Ismail, Muhammad I; Ragab, Hanan M; Bekhit, Adnan A; Ibrahim, Tamer M",Comput Biol Med,,470

Methods: This was a case study of school health in a community-based school reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study target was a 64-year-old private high school with 12 classes for each grade with a total of 1,100 students. Results: A ""school disinfection strategy"" was set up at individual and class environment levels to protect students from the risk of infection. In addition, school health activities were carried out with a ""personal protection safety belt"" and ""community protection safety belt"" for effective implementation. To ensure a safe educational environment for high school students and to ensure smooth execution of face-to-face classes (in-person teaching), the ""prevention safety belt strategy"" was introduced in accordance with governmental guidelines to sequentially implement various preventive measures necessary to guarantee environmental safety of schools. Activating personal prevention safety belts by checking the symptoms of students when entering the school and during each class, and providing self-made disinfectants by spraying alcohol on wet-wipes were cost-effective and sustainable methods used in this school to prevent the spread of infection. Conclusions: The experience of developing a prevention safety belt strategy to adapt the guidelines of the local education office to the school situation was presented. Focusing on the school community, as well as individual students and teachers, the concept of prevention safety belts helped to unite and stimulate voluntary participation of students in health promotion activities.","Kwon, Insook; Kang, Sunjoo; Kim, Jin Sun",Front Public Health,,470

Our department has formally introduced a DIEP Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Pathway in May 2019. Although in a much smaller sample size, our results were similar to this article and we would agree with the authors' conclusion that implementation of such protocol could effectively reduce the length of inpatient stay (LoS) and cost of care, without compromising patient care nor increasing complication rates. Prior to the introduction of ERAS Pathway, 28 of our patients who had DIEP between November 2018 and May 2019 had an mean LoS of 7.1 days (median 6 days, range 5-21 days); whereas 27 patients who experienced the ERAS Pathway between May and December 2019 had an mean LoS of 4.8 days (median 5 days, range 3-7 days). The cost of inpatient stay in a normal ward at our hospital is approximately £232 per patient per day. By reducing an extra 2.3 days of inpatient stay, our Trust could save at least an average of £32,016 per annum with the estimated 60 DIEP performed annually at our department.

269977,A Brief Communication: Anxiety and Depression Levels in the Staff of a Nigerian Private University during COVID 19 Pandemic Outbreak,2020,"The recent pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is unarguably the most fearsome compared with the earlier outbreaks caused by other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Human ACE2 is now established as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Where variations in the viral spike protein, in turn, lead to the cross-species transmission of the virus, genetic variations in the host receptor ACE2 may also contribute to the susceptibility and/or resistance against the viral infection. This study aims to explore the binding of the proteins encoded by different human ACE2 allelic variants with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Briefly, coding variants of ACE2 corresponding to the reported binding sites for its attachment with coronavirus spike protein were selected and molecular models of these variants were constructed by homology modeling. The models were then superimposed over the native ACE2 and ACE2-spike protein complex, to observe structural changes in the ACE2 variants and their intermolecular interactions with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, respectively. Despite strong overall structural similarities, the spatial orientation of the key interacting residues varies in the ACE2 variants compared with the wild-type molecule. Most ACE2 variants showed a similar binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as observed in the complex structure of wild-type ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. However, ACE2 alleles, rs73635825 (S19P) and rs143936283 (E329G) showed noticeable variations in their intermolecular interactions with the viral spike protein. In summary, our data provide a structural basis of potential resistance against SARS-CoV-2 infection driven by ACE2 allelic variants.","Hussain, Mushtaq; Jabeen, Nusrat; Raza, Fozia; Shabbir, Sanya; Baig, Ayesha A; Amanullah, Anusha; Aziz, Basma",J. med. virol,,470

We evaluated whether adults aged 50 and older with caregiving roles are more likely to report reduced illness self-efficacy since the pandemic, and whether this link is exacerbated by a higher number of conditions. METHODS: Participants (105 caregivers and 590 noncaregivers) residing in Michigan (82.6%) and 33 other U.S. states completed one online survey between May 14 and July 9, 2020. RESULTS: Controlling for sociodemographic and health characteristics, stressors related to COVID-19, and behavioral and psychosocial changes since the pandemic, caregivers were more likely than noncaregivers to report reduced illness self-efficacy when they had a higher number of chronic conditions.

272489,The Long-Term Mental Health Effects of COVID-19,2020,"Intensive worldwide efforts are underway to determine both the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the immune responses in COVID-19 patients in order to develop effective therapeutics and vaccines. One type of cell that may contribute to these immune responses is the Î³Î´ T lymphocyte, which plays a key role in immunosurveillance of the mucosal and epithelial barriers by rapidly responding to pathogens. Although found in low numbers in blood, Î³Î´ T cells consist the majority of tissue-resident T cells and participate in the front line of the host immune defense. Previous studies have demonstrated the critical protective role of Î³Î´ T cells in immune responses to other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-1. However, no studies have profoundly investigated these cells in COVID-19 patients to date. Î³Î´ T cells can be safely expanded in vivo using existing inexpensive FDA-approved drugs such as bisphosphonate, in order to test its protective immune response to SARS-CoV-2. To support this line of research, we review insights gained from previous coronavirus research, along with recent findings, discussing the potential role of Î³Î´ T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2. We conclude by proposing several strategies to enhance Î³Î´ T cell's antiviral function, which may be used in developing therapies for COVID-19.","Yazdanifar, Mahboubeh; Mashkour, Narges; Bertaina, Alice",Crit Rev Microbiol,,470
272516,Trends in Home Birth Information Seeking in the United States and United Kingdom During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"In this paper, we investigate how message construction, style, content, and the textual content of embedded images impacted message retransmission over the course of the first 8 months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States. We analyzed a census of public communications (n = 372,466) from 704 public health agencies, state and local emergency management agencies, and elected officials posted on Twitter between January 1 and August 31, 2020, measuring message retransmission via the number of retweets (ie, a message passed on by others), an important indicator of engagement and reach. To assess content, we extended a lexicon developed from the early months of the pandemic to identify key concepts within messages, employing it to analyze both the textual content of messages themselves as well as text included within embedded images (n = 233,877), which was extracted via optical character recognition. Finally, we modelled the message retransmission process using a negative binomial regression, which allowed us to quantify the extent to which particular message features amplify or suppress retransmission, net of controls related to timing and properties of the sending account. In addition to identifying other predictors of retransmission, we show that the impact of images is strongly driven by content, with textual information in messages and embedded images operating in similar ways.

273783,The Correlation between the Fear Level and Oral Health Knowledge Related to Dental Treatment During the COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak,2021,"Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a new class of glucose-lowering agents which have changed the landscape of diabetes therapy, due to their remarkable cardiorenal protective properties. The attack of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on the heart and kidneys shares similarities with diabetes; therefore, the notion that SGLT2i might have a role in the future management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is based on a solid pathophysiological hypothesis. SGLT2i have been proved to decrease the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, ameliorate oxidative stress and reduce sympathetic activity, thus resulting in downregulation of both systemic and adipose tissue inflammation. On the other hand, they have been linked to an increased risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. Therefore, the efficacy and safety of SGLT2i in COVID-19 are still debatable and remain to be clarified by ongoing randomized trials, to assess whether the benefits of treatment with these drugs outweigh the potential risks.","Koufakis, Theocharis; Pavlidis, Antonis N; Metallidis, Symeon; Kotsa, Kalliopi",Int J Clin Pharm,,470

274656,Suicides related to the COVID-19 outbreak in India: A pilot study of media reports,2020,"Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) has garnered increasing attention as a candidate drug delivery polymer owing to its favorable properties, including its excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, non-immunogenicity, and mechanical strength. PLAG are specifically used as microspheres for the sustained/controlled and targeted delivery of hydrophilic or hydrophobic drugs, as well as biological therapeutic macromolecules, including peptide and protein drugs. PLGAs with different molecular weights, lactic acid (LA)/glycolic acid (GA) ratios, and end groups exhibit unique release characteristics, which is beneficial for obtaining diverse therapeutic effects. This review aims to analyze the composition of PLGA microspheres, and understand the manufacturing process involved in their production, from a quality by design perspective. Additionally, the key factors affecting PLGA microsphere development are explored as well as the principles involved in the synthesis and degradation of PLGA and its interaction with active drugs. Further, the effects elicited by microcosmic conditions on PLGA macroscopic properties, are analyzed. These conditions include variations in the organic phase (organic solvent, PLGA, and drug concentration), continuous phase (emulsifying ability), emulsifying stage (organic phase and continuous phase interaction, homogenization parameters), and solidification process (relationship between solvent volatilization rate and curing conditions). The challenges in achieving consistency between batches during manufacturing are addressed, and continuous production is discussed as a potential solution. Finally, potential critical quality attributes are introduced, which may facilitate the optimization of process parameters.","Hua, Yabing; Su, Yuhuai; Zhang, Hui; Liu, Nan; Wang, Zengming; Gao, Xiang; Gao, Jing; Zheng, Aiping",Drug Deliv,,470

We use Germany as an example to illustrate shortcomings of official numbers, which are, at least in Germany, disclosed only with several days of delay and severely underreported on weekends (more than 40%). These shortcomings outline an urgent need for alternative data sources. The other widely cited source provided by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) also deviates for Germany on average by 79% from the official numbers. We argue that Google Search and Twitter data should complement official numbers. They predict even better than the original values from Johns Hopkins University and do so several days ahead. These two data sources could also be used in parts of the world where official numbers do not exist or are perceived to be unreliable.","Skiera, Bernd; Jurgensmeier, Lukas; Stowe, Kevin; Gurevych, Iryna",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03937v1.pdf,470

AKI etiology may be multifactorial and is substantially associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The outcome of AKI-D can vary from partial or complete recovery to transitioning to chronic kidney disease, end stage kidney disease, or even death. Predicting outcomes of patients with AKI is crucial as it may allow clinicians to guide policy regarding adequate management of this problem and offer the best long-term options to their patients in advance.

276253,Nurses' occupational satisfaction during Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease, and the reason behind the currently ongoing pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) has been recognized as the specific receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although the possible effect of ACE2 gene polymorphism remains unknown, human ACE2 receptor expression influences SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 disease outcome. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between ACE gene I/D polymorphism, ACE2 receptor gene polymorphism, and COVID-19 severity. ACE gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and ACE2 receptor gene rs2106809 and rs2285666 polymorphisms were determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism methods, respectively, in 155 COVID-19 patients who were divided into three groups (mild, moderate, and severe) according to clinical symptoms. However, the distribution of genotype and allele frequencies of ACE gene I/D, ACE2 receptor gene rs2106809, and rs2285666 polymorphisms were not statistically significant in all groups. In conclusion, in the study population, ACE gene I/D, ACE2 receptor gene rs2106809, and rs2285666 polymorphisms were not associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection. Although ACE2 receptor gene expression may affect the susceptibility to COVID-19, there is no existing evidence that the ACE or ACE2 gene polymorphisms are directly associated with COVID-19 severity. Interindividual differences in COVID-19 severity might be related to epigenetic mechanisms of ACE2 receptor gene expression or variations in other genes suggested to play a critical role in COVID-19 pathogenesis such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and coagulation indicators.","Karakas Çelik, Sevim; Çakmak Genç, Günes; Piskin, Nihal; Açikgöz, Bilgehan; Altinsoy, Bülent; Kurucu Issiz, Basak; Dursun, Ahmet",J Med Virol,,470
276273,Benefits of Avoiding Unnecessary Medical Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"In the era of COVID-19 outbreak, various efforts are undertaken to develop a quick, easy, inexpensive, and accurate way for diagnosis. Although many commercial diagnostic kits are available, detailed scientific evaluation is lacking, making the public vulnerable to fear of false-positive results. Moreover, current tissue sampling method from respiratory tract requires personal contact of medical staff with a potential asymptomatic SARSCOV- 2 carrier and calls for safe and less invasive sampling method. Here, we have developed a convenient detection protocol for SARS-COV-2 based on a non-invasive saliva self-sampling method by extending our previous studies on development of a laboratory-safe and low-cost detection protocol based on qRT-PCR. We tested and compared various self-sampling methods of self-pharyngeal swab and self-saliva sampling from non-carrier volunteers. We found that the self-saliva sampling procedure gave expected negative results from all of the non-carrier volunteers within 2 hours, indicating cost-effectiveness, speed and reliability of the saliva-based method. For an automated assessment of the sampling quality and degree of positivity for COVID-19, we developed scalable formulae based on a logistic classification model using both cycle threshold and melting temperature from the qRT-PCR results. Our newly developed protocol will allow easy sampling and spatial-separation between patient and experimenter for guaranteed safety. Furthermore, our newly established risk assessment formula can be applied to a large-scale diagnosis in health institutions and agencies around the world.","Won, Joungha; Kazan, Hasan Hüseyin; Kwon, Jea; Park, Myungsun; Ergun, Mehmet Ali; Ozcan, Sureyya; Choi, Byung Yoon; Heo, Won Do; Lee, C Justin",,,470
276668,The COVID-19 Pandemic: Clinical Information for Ophthalmologists,2020,"The recession in India and the UK peaked in 2017 due to the implications of new policy initiatives. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of 2020 intensified the crisis, causing a drastic decline in aggregate demand and output. India and the UK have resorted to monetary and fiscal stimulus packages to face the economic crisis. This study investigated the inflation–unemployment dynamics during the recession and COVID-19 times in India and the UK. Using a generalized additive model (GAM), the results of this study revealed that the recession had given way to stagflation in India. In contrast, in the UK, it has led to a more severe recession in the short-run. During the downturn, policy initiatives aggravate the recession and eventually turn to stagflation in India due to inflation caused by the weak supply side. However, in the UK, the policy initiatives during this downturn pushed the economy into a deeper recession due to reduced demand. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a similar recessionary impact on both economies. A time horizon based recovery plan is suggested to help the economies recover from stagflation and even deeper recession. This framework could enable policymakers to choose the right path of recovery within the shortest possible time.","Victor, Vijay Karakunnel Joshy Joseph Loganathan Swetha Meyer Daniel Francois",Economies,,470

The benefits of this extension are demonstrated both on synthetic and real data that are beyond the reach of existing methods. In particular, we revisit the classical Card&Krueger dataset on the effect of a minimum wage increase on employment in fast food restaurants and obtain new insights about the impact of raising the minimum wage on employment of full- and part-time workers in the fast food industry.","Torous, William; Gunsilius, Florian; Rigollet, Philippe",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05858v1.pdf,470

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Candidates planning to apply to the otolaryngology 2020-21 match were invited to complete a cross-sectional online survey. Distribution was via otomatch.com and word of mouth. Descriptive statistics were performed. RESULTS: Of 85 eligible responses (estimated 18.9% of all applicants), many have had at least one board examination (71.8%) disrupted. A majority (85.9%) believe evaluation of candidates will change due to the pandemic, and 54.1% report they were now less confident in matching. Female applicants (37.6% of respondents) were found to have significantly higher odds of decreased confidence in matching (OR 2.781 [95% CI 1.045-7.4044]; P = .041). Many report a move to virtual interviews would increase the number of applications submitted (45.9%) and the number of interviews attended (77.6%). Some applicants (36.5%) did not believe residency programs would gather sufficient information about their candidacy to make an informed decision, and most (62.4%) did not believe that they would gather sufficient information to inform their own rank list. CONCLUSIONS: We find that candidates believe their candidacy will be assessed differently in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, are largely less confident in successfully matching, and are planning to apply and interview more broadly. These data are relevant to otolaryngology residency leadership to inform clear dialogue and a smooth transition into an unprecedented application cycle.","Izreig, Said; Torabi, Sina J; Kasle, David A; Rahmati, Rahmatullah W; Manes, R Peter",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,,470

METHOD: A total of 2115 subjects from 34 provinces in China were evaluated. A questionnaire was designed, which covers demographic characteristics, knowledge of COVID-19, and factors that influenced anxiety during the outbreak to test public awareness and determine the impact of the outbreak on people's lives. In addition, a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) scale was utilized to assess anxiety levels during the outbreak. Lastly, the chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to identify factors associated with levels of public anxiety. RESULTS: A majority of respondents reported high levels of awareness of COVID-19. A total of 1107 (52.3%), 707 (33.4%), 154 (7.3%), and 147 (7%) respondents exhibited no, mild, moderate, and severe levels of anxiety, respectively. Results of the chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that respondents (a) with no college education, (b) are unaware of neighbors who may have been infected, (c) who spent considerable time collecting information and browsing negative information related to the virus, (d) are unhealthy, and (e) displayed low levels of awareness of the transmission routes were highly likely to be anxious. CONCLUSION: During the outbreak, the majority of people exhibited high levels of awareness and knowledge regarding preventive measures from COVID-19. The absence of psychological anxiety was observed in more than half of the respondents. Adaptive responses to anxiety and high levels of awareness about COVID-19 may have protected the public during the outbreak.","Liu, Yunyu; Li, Pengfei; Lv, Yalan; Hou, Xiaorong; Rao, Qingmao; Tan, Juntao; Gong, Jun; Tan, Chao; Liao, Lifan; Cui, Weilu",Compr Psychiatry,,470

However, few studies have explored the perception and willingness of end-users toward COVID-19-related chatbots. Furthermore, no studies have been conducted in Saudi Arabia. Aim: This paper explored 166 end-users' perceived utilities of health chatbots in Saudi Arabia, and how their characteristics affect their perceptions. Methods: We conducted a quantitative descriptive study by implementing an online survey. The survey asked 20 questions on participants' demographics and their perception of health chatbots' usefulness. Results: We found that users were more willing to use health chatbots to seek general information about COVID-19 (82.5%) over seeking information regarding COVID-19 medical treatments (72.3%). Furthermore, participants with undergraduate degrees tend to use them to learn how to prevent COVID-19's spread (P = 0.015), to self-track COVID-19 symptoms (P = 0.028), and to seek information about medication (P = 0.035) in comparison to those who had postgraduate degrees. Participants who frequently searched for health information on the internet were more likely to look for nearby medical services using health chatbots (P = 0.023). Lastly, participants who provided any sort of healthcare services information were more likely to self-assess COVID-19 symptoms by using health chatbots (P = 0.036). Conclusion: Participant awareness and use of health chatbots were low; however, most had positive perceptions of these emerging technologies and displayed willingness to use them. Further research is needed to capture the real-world usability of these novel technologies by employing more rigid methodological designs (e.g, field trials).","Almalki, Manal",Acta Inform Med,,470

To date, public health organizations' efforts to counter COVID-19 misinformation have focused on identifying and correcting false information on social media platforms. Citing extant literature in health communication and psychology, we argue that these fact-checking efforts are a necessary, but insufficient, response to health misinformation. First, research suggests that fact-checking has several important limitations and is rarely successful in fully undoing the effects of misinformation exposure. Second, there are many factors driving misinformation sharing and acceptance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic-such as emotions, distrust, cognitive biases, racism, and xenophobia-and these factors both make individuals more vulnerable to certain types of misinformation and also make them impervious to future correction attempts. We conclude by outlining several additional measures, beyond fact-checking, that may help further mitigate the effects of misinformation in the current pandemic.","Chou, Wen-Ying Sylvia; Gaysynsky, Anna; Vanderpool, Robin C",Health Educ Behav,,470

The analytical results showed that the level of threat perceived by customers significantly reduced their intention to stay at a hotel. On the contrary, individual customer response efficacy significantly enhanced their intention to stay at a hotel. Additionally, both government and social trust, as well as hotel response efficacy, were found to significantly increase hotel stay intention by mediating the effects of threat perception and individual response efficacy.

Consequently, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) might be generated and have an adverse effect on follicular health. This study aimed to elucidate the negative effects of ROS on mitochondrial functions in FSH-stimulated granulosa cells during the follicular development process and to investigate whether pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) treatment could accelerate this process by ameliorating the adverse effects. To do this, both in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed with granulosa cells from superovulated immature (3-week-old) mice that were pretreated with or without PQQ, and a natural mating study was also performed. The ROS level in FSH-/eCG-stimulated granulosa cells was significantly increased. Moreover, high oxidative stress and mtDNA damage levels were evident in the granulosa cells. PQQ treatment not only reduced the ROS and oxidative stress levels but also ameliorated mtDNA damage, accelerated FSH-/eCG-induced ATP production, and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential and the expression levels of mitochondrial genes (Nd1, Cytb, Cox1, ATPase6) and the mt-ND1 protein. Accordingly, the proliferation and viability of granulosa cells, numbers of healthy preovulatory follicles and ovulated oocytes and serum estrogen level were significantly improved, while the apoptosis of granulosa cells was reduced. However, PQQ treatment did not change the fertility parameters in mature mice with natural cycles but did significantly increased the number of offspring born per delivery. These results revealed that ROS-associated damage in FSH-stimulated granulosa cells adversely affects their physiology and follicular health during the follicular development process. Treatment with PQQ is a beneficial tool to increase both the number of ovulated oocytes and pups per delivery.","Hoque, S A Masudul; Umehara, Takashi; Kawai, Tomoko; Shimada, Masayuki",Free radic. biol. med,,470

281476,Correction to: Well‑Being Reduces COVID‑19 Anxiety: A Three‑Wave Longitudinal Study in China,2021,"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the greater New York metropolitan area became an epicenter for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The initial evolution of case incidence has not been well characterized. METHODS: Northwell Health Laboratories tested 46,793 persons for SARS-CoV-2 from March 4 through April 10. The primary outcome measure was a positive reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. The secondary outcomes included patient age, sex, and race if stated; dates the specimen was obtained and the test result; clinical practice site sources; geo-location of patient residence; and hospitalization. RESULTS: From March 8 through April 10, a total of 26,735 of 46,793 persons (57.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Males of each race were disproportionally more affected than females above age 25, with a progressive male predominance as age increased. Of the positive persons, 7,292 were hospitalized directly upon presentation; an additional 882 persons tested positive in an ambulatory setting before subsequent hospitalization, a median of 4.8 days later. Total hospitalization rate was thus 8,174 persons (30.6% of positive persons). There was a broad range (greater than 10-fold) in the cumulative number of positive cases across individual zip codes following documented first case incidents. Test positivity was greater for persons living in zip codes with lower annual household income. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal that SARS-CoV-2 incidence emerged rapidly and almost simultaneously across a broad demographic population in the region. These findings support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection was widely distributed prior to virus testing availability.","Reichberg, Samuel B; Mitra, Partha P; Haghamad, Aya; Ramrattan, Girish; Crawford, James M; Berry, Gregory J; Davidson, Karina W; Drach, Alex; Duong, Scott; Juretschko, Stefan; Maria, Naomi I; Yang, Yihe; Ziemba, Yonah C",Clin. infect. dis,,470

In Brazil, the official surveillance system of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) investigates influenza A (IAV) and B (IBV) viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (HAdV), and parainfluenza viruses (hPIV 1-3). In Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, many fatalities associated with SARI between 2013 and 2017 occurred among patients without underlying diseases and for whom the causative agent had not been identified using official protocols. This cross-sectional study analyzed the presence of coronaviruses (HCoV), bocavirus (HBoV), metapneumovirus (hMPV), and rhinovirus in patients who died of SARI despite not having comorbidities, and that were negative for IAV, IBV, RSV, HAdV, and hPIV. Nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs from patients were used for nucleic acid extraction. The presence of HCoVs OC43, HKU1, NL63, and 229E; HBoV; hMPV; and rhinovirus was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were also analyzed. Between 2013 and 2017, 16 225 cases of SARI were reported in RS; 9.8% of the patients died; 20% of all fatal cases were patients without comorbidities and for whom no pathogen was detected using standard protocols. Analysis of 271 of these cases identified HCoV in nine cases; HBoV, hMPV, and rhinovirus were detected in 3, 3, and 10 cases, respectively. Of note, patients infected with HCoV were adults. Results reinforce the importance of including coronaviruses in diagnostic panels used by official surveillance systems because besides their pandemic potential, endemic HCoVs are associated to severe disease in healthy adults.","Veiga, Ana B Gorini da; Martins, Letícia G; Riediger, Irina; Mazetto, Alix; Debur, Maria do Carmo; Gregianini, Tatiana S",J Med Virol,,470

Virtual drug screening method and MD simulation were used to analyze 430 phytochemicals of 20 ethnobotanical medicinal plants suggested by Siddha medicine practitioner as antiviral sources and treats symptoms related to COVID19. MD simulation strongly suggested that procyanidin B2 exhibits strong protease inhibition potential, better than the co-crystallized reference ligand O6K. Scientific evidence states that C. fistula exhibits significant antiviral activity against human viral infections in addition to other medicinal activities. The fruit pulp of C. fistula is a readily market available product that can significantly aid in recovering the COVID19 infected patients from complications. It is proposed to the research centers and clinics that are currently treating the COVID19 patients to make an attempt to use the C. fistula fruit pulp as a hot water extract to improve the patient’s response and prevent further mortalities due to the same.","Ravi, Lokesh; Camil Rex, M.; Anirudh Sreenivas, B.

284031,Letter: Neurosurgical Management of Spinal Pathology Via Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Early Experience and Unique Challenges,2020,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the lives of families in an unprecedented way. During the first lockdown, extrafamilial contact was significantly reduced. Many parents had to look after their children and work from home while the economic pressure increased. Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between intimate partner violence (IPV) and mental health problems in children and adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods: In a cross-sectional online survey 687 parents of underaged children in Germany were included. Demographic and psychosocial predictors for IPV and associations with mental health problems of children before and during the first lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed. The survey ran from 18 May 2020 to 21 July 2020 and the lockdown in Germany began on 23 March 2020 and ended via a gradual relaxation. The first schools reopened on 22 April and the opening of schools, kindergartens and daycare centers extended to the end of June 2020. Results: Lower household incomes and the experience of own adverse childhood experiences increased the risk of participants reporting violence in their relationship. According to the participating parents, children and adolescents living in families in which violence was reported by intimate partners were more likely to have higher levels of externalizing problems before and during the pandemic. There were no significant differences with respect to emotional problems. Conclusion: Adverse childhood experiences increase the risk of intimate partner violence, which in turn increases the risk of mental health problems in the children. Therefore, in the psychotherapeutic practice questions should also be systematically asked about corresponding experiences and appropriate treatment offers should be recommended.","Clemens, Vera; Köhler-Dauner, Franziska; Keller, Ferdinand; Ziegenhain, Ute; Fegert, Jörg M; Kölch, Michael",Psychotherapeut (Berl),,470

OBJECTIVE: To describe the results of a rigorous, large-scale COVID-19 testing and monitoring program. DESIGN: The U.S. National Football League (NFL) and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) instituted a large-scale COVID-19 monitoring program involving daily testing using 2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) platforms (Roche cobas and Thermo Fisher QuantStudio), a transcription-mediated amplification platform (Hologic Panther), and an antigen point-of-care (aPOC) test (Quidel Sofia). SETTING: 32 NFL clubs in 24 states during the 2020 NFL season. PARTICIPANTS: NFL players and staff. MEASUREMENTS: SARS-CoV-2 test results were described in the context of medically adjudicated status. Cycle threshold (Ct) values are reported when available. RESULTS: A total of 632 370 tests administered across 11 668 persons identified 270 (2.4%) COVID-19 cases from 1 August to 14 November 2020. Positive predictive values ranged from 73.0% to 82.0% across the RT-PCR platforms. High Ct values (33 to 37) often indicated early infection. For the first positive result, the median Ct value was 32.77 (interquartile range, 30.02 to 34.72) and 22% of Ct values were above 35. Among adjudicated COVID-19 cases tested with aPOC, 42.3% had a negative result. Positive concordance between aPOC test result and adjudicated case status increased as viral load increased. LIMITATIONS: Platforms varied by laboratory, and test variability may reflect procedural differences. CONCLUSION: Routine RT-PCR testing allowed early detection of infection. Cycle threshold values provided a useful guidepost for understanding results, with high values often indicating early infection. Antigen POC testing was unable to reliably rule out COVID-19 early in infection.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of billing data. SETTING: A large-volume practice with both community and tertiary care providers. METHODS: As part of a quality initiative, billing data were queried to identify children <18 years of age who underwent tympanostomy tube placement between January 2019 and December 2020. Patient age, practice location, and case numbers were gathered. RESULTS: The study included data from 2652 patients. Prior to state-mandated clinic and operating room restrictions, there were no significant differences in the number of tympanostomy tubes placed (P = .64), including month-to-month comparisons, the distribution of patients being cared for at community vs tertiary care sites (P = .63), or patient age at the time of surgery (P = .97) between 2019 and 2020. After resumption of outpatient clinical and elective surgical activities, the number of tympanostomy tubes placed decreased significantly between 2019 and 2020 (831 vs 303 cases, P = .003), with a persistent month-to-month difference. In addition, patients undergoing tube placement were older (4.5 vs 3.2 years, P < .001). The distribution of cases performed in the community setting decreased during this time period as well (P < .001). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of pediatric tympanostomy tube placement has significantly decreased. The age of patients undergoing surgery has increased, and more children are being cared for in a tertiary setting. These findings may reflect changes in the prevalence of acute and chronic otitis media as the result of the pandemic.","Diercks, Gillian R; Cohen, Michael S",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,470

So far, the mechanisms underlying sleep disruptions in AUD are poorly understood. Because sleep-related regions vastly overlap with regions, where patients with AUD showed pronounced grey matter (GM) reduction; we hypothesized that GM structure could contribute to sleep disturbances associated with chronic alcohol use. We combined sleep EEG recording and high-resolution structural brain imaging to examine the GM-sleep associations in 36 AUD vs. 26 healthy controls (HC). The patterns of GM-sleep associations differed for N3 vs. REM sleep and for AUD vs. HC. For cortical thickness (CT), CT-sleep associations were significant in AUD but not in HC and were lateralized such that lower CT in right hemisphere was associated with shorter N3, whereas in left hemisphere was associated with shorter REM sleep. For the GM density (GMD), we observed a more extensive positive GMD-N3 association in AUD (right orbitofrontal cortex, cerebellum, dorsal cingulate and occipital cortex) than in HC (right orbitofrontal cortex), and the GMD-REM association was positive in AUD (midline, motor and paralimbic regions) whereas negative in HC (the left supramarginal gyrus). GM structure mediated the effect of chronic alcohol use on the duration of N3 and the age by alcohol effect on REM sleep. Our findings provide evidence that sleep disturbances in AUD were associated with GM reductions. Targeting sleep-related regions might improve sleep in AUD and enhance sleep-induced benefits in cognition and emotional regulation for recovery.","Zhang, Rui; Tomasi, Dardo; Manza, Peter; Shokri-Kojori, Ehsan; Demiral, Sukru B; Feldman, Dana E; Kroll, Danielle S; Biesecker, Catherine L; McPherson, Katherine L; Wang, Gene-Jack; Wiers, Corinde E; Volkow, Nora D",Transl Psychiatry,,470

What are the challenges of the near-zero interest and inflation rates for monetary policy? What can the policymakers learn from the latest developments in the monetary and interest rate theory? This paper aims to answer these questions by reviewing both basic principles of interest rate determination and recent academic and policy debates.Design/methodology/approachThe paper critically reviews the explanations for the downward trend of real interest rates in recent decades and monetary policy options in a near-zero interest rate environment.FindingsThe decline of real interest rates is likely an outcome of multiple technological, social and economic factors including diminished productivity growth, changing demographics, elevated tail-risk concerns, time-varying convenience yields of safe assets, increased global demand for safe assets, rising wealth and income inequality, falling relative price of capital, accommodative monetary policies, and changes in industry structure that alter the investment and saving behaviors of the corporate sector. The near-zero interest rate limits the space of central banks' response to economic crises. It also challenges some conventional wisdoms of monetary theory and sparks radically new ideas about monetary policy.Originality/valueThis survey differs from the existing work by taking a broader view of both economics and finance literature. It critically assesses the economic forces driving the global decline of real interest rates through the lens of basic principles and empirical evidence and discusses the merits and limitations of each proposed explanation. The study emphasizes the importance of a better understanding of economic forces driving diverging trends of corporate investment and saving behaviors. It also discusses the implications of the neo-Fisherism and the fiscal theory of price level for monetary policy in a low interest rate environment.","Wu, Youchang",China Finance Review International,,470

287290,eLearning in Physical Therapy: Lessons Learned From Transitioning a Professional Education Program to Full eLearning During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Mobility resilience refers to the ability of individuals to complete their desired travel despite unplanned disruptions to the transportation system. The potential of new on-demand mobility options, such as ridesourcing services, to fill unpredicted gaps in mobility is an underexplored source of adaptive capacity. Applying a natural experiment approach to newly released ridesourcing data, we examine variation in the gap-filling role of on-demand mobility during sudden shocks to a transportation system by analyzing the change in use of ridesourcing during unexpected rail transit service disruptions across the racially and economically diverse city of Chicago. Using a multilevel mixed model, we control not only for the immediate station attributes where the disruption occurs, but also for the broader context of the community area and city quadrant in a three-level structure. Thereby the unobserved variability across neighborhoods can be associated with differences in factors such as transit ridership, or socio-economic status of residents, in addition to controlling for station level effects. Our findings reveal that individuals use ridesourcing as a gap-filling mechanism during rail transit disruptions, but there is strong variation across situational and locational contexts. Specifically, our results show larger increases in transit disruption responsive ridesourcing during weekdays, nonholidays, and more severe disruptions, as well as in community areas that have higher percentages of White residents and transit commuters, and on the more affluent northside of the city. These findings point to new insights with far-reaching implications on how ridesourcing complements existing transport networks by providing added capacity during disruptions but does not appear to bring equitable gap-filling benefits to low-income communities of color that typically have more limited mobility options.","Borowski, Elisa; Soria, Jason; Schofer, Joseph; Stathopoulos, Amanda",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15889v1.pdf,470
287291,eLearning in Physical Therapy: Lessons Learned From Transitioning a Professional Education Program to Full eLearning During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: There are few studies to compare antibody response against anti-spike (S) and anti- nucleoprotein (N) SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the IgG antibody production against S and N antigens of the virus and their correlation with the time and severity of the disease. METHODS: The IgG antibodies against S and N antigens of SARS-CoV-2 in serum specimens of 72 symptomatic patients who tested real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction positive for SARS-CoV-2 were detected using the ELISA technique. Different antibody response was compared and the correlation with the time from disease onset and the severity was evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-eight of 72 (67%) patients tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, while 24 (33%) did not have detectable antibodies. Comparison of antibody levels for N and S antibodies showed that they correlate with each other well (r= 0.81; P< 0.001). However, sensitivity of anti-S SARS-CoV-2 IgG and anti-N SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 30% and 60%, during the first 7 days after symptom onset (r= 0.53; P= 0.111), but increased to 73% and 68% at more than 1-week post symptom onset (r= 0.89, P= 0.111), respectively. Cases with positive IgG response showed a decreased CD8+ T cells percentage compared to the negative IgG groups (26 ± 14 vs. 58 ± 32, p= 0.066 in anti-N IgG group and 28 ± 15 vs. 60 ± 45, p= 0.004 in anti-S IgG group, respectively). CONCLUSION: Nearly one-third of the confirmed COVID-19 patients had negative serology results. Lower percent positivity at early time points after symptom onset (less than 1 week) was seen using anti-S SARS-COV-2 IgG kit compare to the anti-N SARS-CoV-2 IgG; therefore, clinicians should interpret negative serology results of especially anti-S SARS-CoV-2 IgG with caution.","Rezaei, Mitra; Sadeghi, Mohammadhadi; Korourian, Alireza; Tabarsi, Payam; Porabdollah, Mihan; Askari, Elham; Mortaz, Esmaeil; Mahmoudi, Shima; Marjani, Majid; Velayati, Ali Akbar",Hum Antibodies,,470

We used a web-based survey with a short questionnaire of 13 questions, translated into four languages (Greek, German, French, and Portuguese). The questionnaire included information about demographic and professional data, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of sleep, degree of abidance in lockdown measures, and data about illness or close contact with active confirmed cases of COVID-19. Initially, 2093 individuals participated. After exclusion of those who did not report their duration of sleep, the final sample comprised 1908 participants (Greek, n = 1271; German, n = 257, French, n = 48; Portuguese, n = 332), aged 42.6 ± 12.7 years, who were considered for further analysis.

A week*occupation interaction on sleep duration was demonstrated (p < 0.001, Î·2 = 0.012). Sleep duration remained stable in health professionals (-0.18 h; 95% CI -0.36, 0.01; p = 0.063), whereas it increased in other occupations by 0.31 h (95% CI, 0.24, 0.39; p < 0.001). In terms of sleep quality, 15% of participants characterized their sleep as bad and 37.9% as average during the lockdown week. Almost 1 in 3 individuals (31.3%) reported worse quality of sleep during the lockdown week than under normal conditions. Sleep during the lockdown week was characterized as good by 47.1%, but only 38% of the health professionals group. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown affected sleep in different ways, depending on age, level of education, occupation, and country of residence.","Trakada, Athanasia; Nikolaidis, Pantelis T; Andrade, Marilia Dos Santos; Puccinelli, Paulo José; Economou, Nicholas-Tiberio; Steiropoulos, Paschalis; Knechtle, Beat; Trakada, Georgia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,470

We provide a formula for the critical width [Formula: see text] of barrier zone. We show that when a barrier zone is set at the front of a population, if the width of barrier zone is bigger than [Formula: see text] then the barrier zone can stop the population invasion, and if the width of barrier zone is less than [Formula: see text] then the population crosses the barrier zone and eventually occupies the entire space. The results are proven by establishing the existence and attractivity of three types of equilibrium solutions.

It was aimed to test this hypothesis, and the study was carried out to examine pandemic measures the effect of on the nutritional, depression and stress conditions of people with obesity. Methods: The individuals who participated in the study were people with obesity who received follow-up dietary therapy in a private hospital. Three separate scales were applied to the individuals, which measured the desire to overeating request, depression status and stress-fighting status. Results: This study was conducted on 368 individuals. Women had lower values of BMI (28.57+/-3.89 kg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) than men (30.64+/-2.87 kg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). When the scores of the excessive eating request scale mean scores before and during the pandemic were examined, it was seen that the scores of the individuals increased during the pandemic. In the multivariate regression model, it was seen that the increase of stress and BMI increased the FCQ score (p&lt;0.001). Multiple regression models were created by taking into account the criteria that caused the score increase. Each variable can predict the FCQ score separately. The predictor significance order of variants on FCQ score beta values is as follows: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (beta=0.774), before pandemic FCQ (beta=0.601), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (beta=-0.268), before pandemic BMI&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; (beta=-0.223), during pandemic BMI&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; (beta=0.073), and age (beta=-0.013). Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic, making applications such as quarantine in pandemic processes has successful results in being able to combat its. However, undesirable conditions such as stress can have serious negative consequences on other health measurements. It was observed in the results of this study that excessive eating food desire developed in people with obesity.","Bayram Deger, V.","Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity Targets and Therapy",,470

Since then, the virus has spread to the continents, causing a major pandemic. The impacts of this pandemic on the education of human anatomy interfere in at least two aspects: (1) receiving and managing anatomical specimens in anatomy laboratories and (2) adaptations for classes on remote virtual teaching. Therefore, this study reviewed and discussed the legal and bioethical aspects, considering the scenario of a South American Country, aiming to stimulate the debate on these two relevant themes in the international community. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impossibility of mass testing, anatomists and other workers in the field must deal with the risk of receiving bodies infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this situation, additional care measures in biosafety practices are essential to protect the staff. Such measures are: the bodies must be preserved by the perfusion of formaldehyde or other fixative solutions; embalming must be performed in ventilated rooms with a good air exhaust system; to avoid excessive manipulation of bodies and procedures such as pulmonary insufflation or craniotomy; and proper use of personal protective equipment, including lab coat, gloves and masks. As for exposure of body images in online classes, this review showed that there are no legal impediments to this end. However, anatomists must adopt measures aimed at protecting the memory of the deceased, such as using secure digital platforms with restricted access; family authorization/consent and student awareness.","Lemos, George Azevedo; Araújo, Diego Neves; de Lima, Fernando José Camello; Bispo, Rodrigo Freitas Monte",Ann Anat,,470

METHODS: The enteric tissue was examined by hematoxylin & eosin stain, PAS (Periodic acid-Schiff) staining, Gram staining, Ziehl-Neelsen stain and Grocott's Methenamine Silver (GMS) Stain. The distribution of CD3, CD4, CK20 and CD68, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) antigen were determined by immunohistochemistry. In situ hybridization (ISH) of SARS-CoV-2 and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA (EBER) were also performed. RESULTS: We observed mucosal epithelium shedding, intestinal mucosal erosion, focal inflammatory necrosis with hemorrhage, massive neutrophil infiltration, macrophage proliferation accompanied by minor lymphocyte infiltration. Fungal spores and gram positive cocci but not mycobacteria tuberculosis were identified. Immunohistochemistry staining showed abundant CD68+ macrophages but few lymphocytes infiltration. HSV, CMV and EBV were negative. ISH of SARS-CoV-2 RNA showed positive signal which mostly overlapped with CD68 positivity. CONCLUSIONS: The in situ detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in intestinal macrophages implicates a possible route for gastrointestinal infection.

295164,Reduction of COVID-19 Anxiety Levels Through Relaxation Techniques: A Study Carried Out in Northern Spain on a Sample of Young University Students,2020,"By the time they are typically detected, neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are already challenging to treat. Preventive and early intervention strategies in infancy are critical for improving outcomes over the lifespan with significant cost savings. However, the impact of prevention and early intervention efforts is dependent upon our ability to identify infants most appropriate for such interventions. Because there may be significant overlap between prodromal symptoms across neurodevelopmental disorders and child psychopathology more broadly which may wax and wane across development, we contend that the impact of prevention and early intervention efforts will be heightened by identifying early indicators that may overlap across ASD and other commonly co-occurring disorders. This paper summarizes the existing literature on infant symptoms and identification of ASD to demonstrate the ways in which a transdiagnostic perspective could expand the impact of early identification and intervention research and clinical efforts, and to outline suggestions for future empirical research programs addressing current gaps in the identification-to-treatment pipeline. We propose four recommendations for future research that are both grounded in developmental and clinical science and that are scalable for early intervention systems: (1) development of fine-grained, norm-referenced measures of ASD-relevant transdiagnostic behavioral domains; (2) identification of shared and distinct mechanisms influencing the transition from risk to disorder; (3) determination of key cross-cutting treatment strategies (both novel and extracted from existing approaches) effective in targeting specific domains across disorders; and (4) integration of identified measures and treatments into existing service systems.","Talbott, Meagan R; Miller, Meghan R",J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol,,470

To maximize the benefit from the rollout phase, an optimal strategy of vaccine allocation is necessary based on each country's epidemic status. (2) Methods: We first developed a heterogeneous population model considering the transmission matrix using maximum likelihood estimation based on the epidemiological records of individual COVID-19 cases in the Republic of Korea. Using this model, the vaccine priorities for minimizing mortality or incidence were investigated. (3) Results: The simulation results showed that the optimal vaccine allocation strategy to minimize the mortality (or incidence) was to prioritize elderly and healthcare workers (or adults) as long as the reproductive number was below 1.2 (or over 0.9). (4) Conclusion: Our simulation results support the current Korean government vaccination priority strategy, which prioritizes healthcare workers and senior groups to minimize mortality, under the condition that the reproductive number remains below 1.2. This study revealed that, in order to maintain the current vaccine priority policy, it is important to ensure that the reproductive number does not exceed the threshold by concurrently implementing nonpharmaceutical interventions.","Ko, Youngsuk; Lee, Jacob; Kim, Yeonju; Kwon, Donghyok; Jung, Eunok",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,470

Nasal epithelial cells are an important site for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent findings on the endotypes of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Endotypes of CRSwNP are characterized by type 1, type 2 and type 3 inflammation according to patterns of inflammatory cells and the cytokines expressed in nasal tissue. Nasal epithelial cells show the highest expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, among all investigated cells in the respiratory tree. SARS-CoV-2 infection likely leads to increased activation of T-helper-1 (Th1) cell responses. Recent studies further suggest that ACE2 may be upregulated by type 1 and downregulated by type 2 inflammatory cytokines in nasal epithelial cells. SUMMARY: Expression of ACE2 in nasal epithelial cells is influenced by inflammatory endotypes of CRSwNP. Type 1 inflammation in nasal tissue may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by upregulating ACE2 expression. However, clinical association between CRSwNP and COVID-19 is still unclear.","Wang, Ming; Wang, Chengshuo; Zhang, Luo",Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol,,470

We aimed to describe the epidemiological and demographic features of COVID-19 outside Wuhan. METHODS: A single-center case series of 136 consecutive (from January 16 to February 17, 2020) patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in The First People's Hospital of Jingzhou, China, was retrospectively analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until February 19, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 136 patients (median age, 49 years; interquartile range [IQR], 33-63 years; range, 0.3-83 years), 91 (67%) had been to Wuhan or contacted persons from Wuhan. Forty-five (33.1%) were familial clusters. The median incubation period was 6 days (IQR: 4-11 days). All children had an exact exposure history, family members with COVID-19, and ""Mild/Moderate"" symptoms at admission. Among the 64 elderly patients, 14 (21.9%) had no exposure history, and 43 (67.2%) had a chronic illness. All 11 (8.1%) ""Severe/very severe"" illness at onset cases and 5 (3.7%) fatal cases were elderly patients. The duration from symptom onset to admission was positively correlated with the duration from symptom onset to endpoint. Overall, patients with a longer incubation period had more severe outcomes. CONCLUSION: As high-risk susceptible groups, strong protection should be implemented for children and the elderly. Universal screening should be performed for people with a clear exposure history, even lacking apparent symptoms. Given the rapid progression of COVID-19, people should be admitted quickly following symptom onset.","Zhao, Chenkai; Xu, Yueqin; Zhang, Xu; Zhong, Yaping; Long, Li; Zhan, Wenzhi; Xu, Tingting; Zhan, Chen; Chen, Yuehan; Zhu, Jinghai; Xiao, Wei; He, Miao",J Infect Public Health,,470

299156,Correction to: Incidental lowering of otitis-media complaints in otitis-prone children during COVID-19 pandemic: not all evil comes to hurt,2020,"Introduction: After the outbreak of a new coronavirus subtype SARS-CoV-2 in China in late 2019, a global pandemic developed, generating a health, economic, and social emergency [1] In Spain, the COVID-19 pandemic crisis forced the government to declare a state of emergency on 14 March 2020 and to implement unprecedented lockdown restriction In this context, patients with severe mental disorders (SMD) may be particularly exposed to stress and social distancing measures [2, 3] and thus disproportionately vulnerable to public health interventions to fight the COVID-19 [4] However, the early psychological impact of the pandemic and the lockdown in this population is still mostly unknown Aims of the study: Here, we aim to compare the early psychological impact (depression, anxiety, and stress responses, intrusive and avoidant thoughts, and coping strategies) in a sample of people with SMD compared with two control groups: other mental disorders (OMD) and healthy controls (HC) Methods: An anonymous online questionnaire using a snowball sampling method was conducted from March 19-26, 2020 and included sociodemographic and clinical data along with the Spanish versions of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) A total of 21,279 people living in Spain answered the questionnaire, and 125 people with SMD were included in the analysis Subjects in each of the two control groups (OMD, n = 250;HC, n = 250) were matched (ratio 1:2) for sex and age (± 1 year) with the SMD group We performed descriptive and bivariate analyses and multinomial and linear regression models Results: People with SMD [mean age = 43 25 years (SD = 14 41);61 6% females] had statistically significantly higher scores on anxiety, stress, and depression subscales of the DASS-21 compared with the HC group, but lower scores than OMD in all domains (p &lt; 0 05) Most people with SMD (87 2%) were able to enjoy free time, although control groups had higher percentages After controlling for confounding factors, anxiety was the only significant psychological domain with lower scores in HC than people with SMD (OR = 0 721;95% CI: 0 579 - 0 898) In the SMD group, the multiple linear regression model (R2 = 0 580, F = 41 027, p &lt; 0 001) found that higher anxiety was associated with being single (ẞ = 0 144, t = 2 291, p = 0 024), having COVID-19 symptoms (ẞ = 0 146, t = 2 395, p = 0 018), and a higher score on the stress subscale (ẞ = 0 538, t = 7 635, p &lt; 0 001);whereas being able to enjoy free time was a protective factor (ẞ = -0 244, t = -3 692, p &lt; 0 001) Conclusions: Our results showed that patients with SMD reacted to the pandemic and the lockdown restrictions with higher anxiety levels than the general public, suggesting that this domain could be a criterion for early intervention strategies and closer follow-up No conflict of interest","Santo, F.

The third target under SDG 12 (Target 12.3) on Responsible Production and Consumption aims to halve food waste by 2030 at retail and consumer levels, considering that more than half of its quantity is generated by final consumers, both indoor and outdoor. However, the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak at the beginning of 2020 imposed several food consumption behaviors and lifestyle changes: food service facilities (e.g., restaurants, pubs, cafés, hotels, resorts) have been closed roughly all over the world, generating a sharp domestic consumption and an expected increase in household waste. The authors conducted an explorative research through the food diary approach. The purpose of this paper is to have a better understanding of household food consumption and wastage trends during Covid-19 pandemic testing, as well as food diary methodology strengths and weaknesses. Food diaries, even with their intrinsic limitations and biases, represent a valuable technique to obtain detailed qualitative and quantitative knowledge on daily food consumption and consumers' behavior. Through the limited but significant results achieved, the authors highlight the logistics of the methodology and the food waste generation trends among a small sample of Italian families during the Covid-19 pandemic. Further, healthier work-life balances, adequate time management and smart food delivery seem to be good opportunities for food waste reduction in households.","Amicarelli, Vera; Bux, Christian",Food Secur,,470

With no effective treatments and with time needed to develop a vaccine, alternative approaches are being used to control this pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to identify topics, opinions, and recommendations about the COVID-19 pandemic discussed by medical professionals on the Twitter social medial platform. METHODS: Using a mixed methods approach blending the capabilities of social media analytics and qualitative analysis, we analyzed COVID-19-related tweets posted by medical professionals and examined their content. We used qualitative analysis to explore the collected data to identify relevant tweets and uncover important concepts about the pandemic using qualitative coding. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques and text analysis were used to identify topics and opinions. RESULTS: Data were collected from 119 medical professionals on Twitter about the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 10,096 English tweets were collected from the identified medical professionals between December 1, 2019 and April 1, 2020. We identified eight topics, namely actions and recommendations, fighting misinformation, information and knowledge, the health care system, symptoms and illness, immunity, testing, and infection and transmission. The tweets mainly focused on needed actions and recommendations (2827/10,096, 28%) to control the pandemic. Many tweets warned about misleading information (2019/10,096, 20%) that could lead to infection of more people with the virus. Other tweets discussed general knowledge and information (911/10,096, 9%) about the virus as well as concerns about the health care systems and workers (909/10,096, 9%). The remaining tweets discussed information about symptoms associated with COVID-19 (810/10,096, 8%), immunity (707/10,096, 7%), testing (605/10,096, 6%), and virus infection and transmission (503/10,096, 5%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that Twitter and social media platforms can help identify important and useful knowledge shared by medical professionals during a pandemic.","Wahbeh, Abdullah; Nasralah, Tareq; Al-Ramahi, Mohammad; El-Gayar, Omar",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,470

301802,Imaging approach to COVID-19 Associated Pulmonary Embolism,2021,"Dostoevsky’s spirit is broken by a difficult childhood, years of imprisonment and forced military ser-vice in the difficult conditions of remote Russia, and the shackles of married life with the “sick, hysterical wid-ow”. Wandering through dreamy Europe made him aware of the attachment to the Russian homeland and revealed love and allusion of peace;he falls in love with Ana by dictating the text of the “Gambler”, which will provide them with bread and shelter in the days of losing the gambling luck and questionable existence. In his wandering through Europe as the “land of holy wonders”, Dostoevsky informs us through the confessions of the gambler Alexei about the temptations of the “world” addicted to the gambling table. The significance of divisive passions is questioned: those towards women, love and even more, gambling, destructive, demonic. In 27 days while he was presenting Ana with the thoughts of the main character of the “Gambler”, and she was recording them in a transcript, the writer was going through his own agony. The novel will see the light of day, but unlike Alexei, a character waiting for a new tomorrow to decide on ending a life driven by an unhealthy ad-dictive habit, Dostoevsky, after the novel ends, experiences catharsis and sails into economic security by taking royalties for this and subsequent novels. As when after a stormy night at sea, a sunny morning dawns, a hint of love, happiness and the desired family peace is prayed to the author. Ana will focus the writer, a gambler, on family life and caring for children, and abduct him from addiction by sailing with him to the next “storm”. The basic theme of the novel – the obsession with gambling – is the experience of Dostoevsky, a writer with “a heart in which God and Satan fight, and the pledge is human life.” In the days when in the hustle and bustle of mod-ern life, COVID-19, complete human alienation and escalation of violence we turn to the spiritual, looking for a way out in the metaphysical, surreal, healing and nurturing, and rational and explainable does not offer a final answer, someone seeks a way out of addiction and someone in a classic, something familiar and valuable. Or in metaphysics that goes beyond the physical and the knowable, in an attempt to reach the higher, the spiritual. The return to the great connoisseur of the human psyche, Dostoevsky, in a return to the interest in man, the inspiration of the human and the humane, but also the space behind knowable and the “metaphysical drama”. The idea of the French writer Albarez that for Dostoevsky, “in contrast to most other novelists, man is primarily not a biological, social, economic, psychological, but a metaphysical being”, becomes understandable. © 2021 KBCSM, Zagreb.","Matić, J.",Archives of psychiatry research,,470

We describe the clinical course and examine factors associated with outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Germany. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study we included patients with COVID-19 admitted to a national network of German hospitals between February 12 and June 12, 2020. We examined demographic characteristics, comorbidities and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We included 1904 patients with a median age of 73 years, 48.5% (924/1904) of whom were female. The mortality rate was 17% (317/1835; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 16-19), the rate of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was 21% (399/1860; 95%CI 20-23), and the rate of invasive mechanical ventilation was 14% (250/1850: 95%CI 12-15). The most prominent risk factors for death were male sex (hazard ratio (HR) 1.45; 95%CI 1.15-1.83), pre-existing lung disease (HR 1.61; 95%CI 1.20-2.16), and increased patient age (HR 4.11 (95%CI 2.57-6.58) for age >79 years versus <60 years). Among patients admitted to the ICU, the mortality rate was 29% (109/374; 95%CI 25-34) and higher in ventilated (33% [77/235; 95%CI 27-39]) than in non-ventilated ICU patients (23%, 32/139; 95%CI 16-30; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide series of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Germany, in-hospital and ICU mortality rates were substantial.

Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)-an autoimmune demyelinating inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS)-are predominantly treated with immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), which can increase the risk of infection. Therefore, there is concern that these patients may have a higher risk of COVID-19. In response to growing concerns of neurologists and patients, this study aimed to determine the prevalence, severity, and possible complications of COVID-19 infection in patients with MS in Saudi Arabia (SA). METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, demographic and clinical data were obtained from patients residing in SA with MS who had a positive result for COVID-19 per reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test or viral gene sequencing, using respiratory or plasma samples. Comparison of COVID-19 severity groups was performed using one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test for numerical variables and Chi-squared test for categorical variables. RESULTS: Seventy patients with MS and COVID-19 (71% female) were included in this analysis. Of the 53 (75.7%) patients receiving a DMT at the time of COVID-19 infection, the most frequently used DMTs were fingolimod (25%) and interferon-beta (25%). Nine (13%) patients had MS relapse and were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone in the four weeks before COVID-19 infection. The most common symptoms at the peak of COVID-19 infection were fever (46%), fatigue (37%), and headache (36%). Symptoms lasted for a mean duration of 8.7 days; all symptomatic patients recovered and no deaths were reported. COVID-19 severity was categorized in three groups: asymptomatic (n = 12), mild-not requiring hospitalization (n = 48), and requiring hospitalization (n = 10; two of whom were admitted to the intensive care unit [ICU]). Between the three groups, comparison of age, body mass index , Expanded Disability Severity Score , MS disease duration, and DMT use at the time of infection showed no significant differences. A higher percentage of patients who were admitted to hospital or the ICU (40%; p = 0.026) presented with an MS relapse within the prior four weeks compared with those who were asymptomatic or had a mild infection (both 8.3%). CONCLUSION: These findings present a reassuring picture regarding COVID-19 infection in patients with MS. However, patients with MS who have had a relapse in the preceding four weeks (requiring glucocorticoid treatment) may have an increased risk of severe COVID-19.","Alshamrani, Foziah; Alnajashi, Hind; AlJumah, Mohammed; Almuaigel, Mohammad; Almalik, Yaser; Makkawi, Seraj; Alsalman, Sadiq; Almejally, Mousa; Qureshi, Shireen; Aljarallah, Salman; AlKhawajah, Nuha; Kedah, Hanaa; Alotaibi, Hessa; Saeedi, Jameelah; Alamri, Abdulla",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,470

Although several studies have demonstrated the potential of deep learning in the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 using CT and X-ray, the generalization on unseen samples needs to be improved. To tackle this problem, we present the contrastive multi-task convolutional neural network (CMT-CNN), which is composed of two tasks. The main task is to diagnose COVID-19 from other pneumonia and normal control. The auxiliary task is to encourage local aggregation though a contrastive loss: first, each image is transformed by a series of augmentations (Poisson noise, rotation, etc.). Then, the model is optimized to embed representations of a same image similar while different images dissimilar in a latent space. In this way, CMT-CNN is capable of making transformation-invariant predictions and the spread-out properties of data are preserved. We demonstrate that the apparently simple auxiliary task provides powerful supervisions to enhance generalization. We conduct experiments on a CT dataset (4,758 samples) and an X-ray dataset (5,821 samples) assembled by open datasets and data collected in our hospital. Experimental results demonstrate that contrastive learning (as plugin module) brings solid accuracy improvement for deep learning models on both CT (5.49%-6.45%) and X-ray (0.96%-2.42%) without requiring additional annotations. Our codes are accessible online.","Li, Jinpeng; Zhao, Gangming; Tao, Yaling; Zhai, Penghua; Chen, Hao; He, Huiguang; Cai, Ting",Pattern Recognit,,470

However, little is known about how alterations to the intestinal immune system and sphingolipids contribute to pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). We used WT mice, RORÎ³t-deficient mice, sphingosine kinase-deficient mice and local gut anti-inflammatory, 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5-ASA)-treated mice in a chronic-binge ethanol feeding model. Targeted lipidomics assessed the sphingolipids in gut and liver samples. Gut immune cell populations, the amounts of sphingolipids, and the level of liver injury were examined. Results: Alcohol intake induces a pro-inflammatory shift in immune cell populations in the gut, including an increase in Th17 cells. Using RORÎ³t-deficient mice, we found that Th17 cells are required for alcohol-associated gut inflammation and the development of ALD. Treatment with 5-ASA decreases alcohol-induced liver injury and reverses gut inflammation by the suppression of CD4+ /RORÎ³t+ /IL-17A+ cells. Increased Th17 cells were due to upregulation of SK1 activity and RORÎ³t activation. We found that S1P/S1PR1 signaling are required for the development of Th17 cell-mediated ALD. Importantly, in vivo intervention blocking of S1P/S1PR1 signaling markedly attenuated alcohol-induced liver inflammation, steatosis, and damage. Conclusion: Gut inflammation is a functional alteration of immune cells in ALD. Reducing gut Th17 cells leads to reduced liver damage. S1P signaling was crucial in the pathogenesis of ALD in a Th17 cell dependent manner. Furthermore, our findings suggest that compounds that reduce gut inflammation locally may represent a unique targeted approach in the treatment of ALD.","Chu, Shenghui; Sun, Rui; Gu, Xuemei; Chen, Liang; Liu, Min; Guo, HaiXun; Ju, Songwen; Vatsalya, Vatsalya; Feng, Wenke; McClain, Craig J; Deng, Zhongbin",Hepatology (Baltim.),,470

The study aims to assess the relations between social impact and mental health among adults living in Spain during COVID-19 lockdown measures, taking a gender-based approach into account. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among adults living in Spain during the lockdown of COVID-19 with an online survey from 8 April to 28 May 2020. The main variable was mental health measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale for anxiety and the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression. Sex-stratified multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to assess the association between social impact variables, anxiety and depression. RESULTS: A total of 7053 people completed this survey. A total of 31.2% of women and 17.7% of men reported anxiety. Depression levels were reported in 28.5% of women and 16.7% of men. A higher proportion of anxiety and depression levels was found in the younger population (18-35 years), especially in women. Poorer mental health was mainly related to fear of COVID-19 infection, with higher anxiety levels especially in women (adjusted ordinal OR (aOR): 4.23, 95% CI 3.68 to 4.87) and worsened economy with higher levels of depression in women (aOR: 1.51, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.84), and perceived inadequate housing to cope with lockdown was especially associated with anxiety in men (aOR: 2.53, 95% CI 1.93 to 3.44). CONCLUSION: The social impact of the lockdown is related to gender, age and socioeconomic conditions. Women and young people had worse mental health outcomes during lockdown. It is urgent to establish strategies for public health emergencies that include mental health and its determinants, taking a gender-based approach into account, in order to reduce health inequities.","Jacques-Aviñó, Constanza; López-Jiménez, Tomàs; Medina-Perucha, Laura; de Bont, Jeroen; Gonçalves, Alessandra Queiroga; Duarte-Salles, Talita; Berenguera, Anna",BMJ Open,,470

However, the implementation of good governance by the Singapore government itself is carried out by steps and decisions that will be taken and implemented through the digital bureaucracy to the community in order to suppress the positive number of COVID-19. The application of good governance also needs support other crucial elements that improved by digital bureaucracy, which are transparency, accountability, efficiency and effective.","Abdou, Ahmed Mohammad",J Public Aff,,470

307246,Trauma exposure and the ptsd symptoms of college teachers during the peak of the covid-19 outbreak,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a devastating impact on the health and welfare of the global population. A key measure to combat COVID-19 has been the effective screening of infected patients. A vital screening process is the chest radiograph. Initial studies have shown irregularities in the chest radiographs of COVID-19 patients. The use of the chest X-ray (CXR), a leading diagnostic technique, has been encouraged and driven by several ongoing projects to combat this disease because of its historical effectiveness in providing clinical insights on lung diseases. This study introduces a dilated bi-branched convoluted neural network (CNN) architecture, VGG-COVIDNet, to detect COVID-19 cases from CXR images. The front end of the VGG-COVIDNet consists of the first 10 layers of VGG-16, where the convolutional layers in these layers are reduced to two to minimize latency during the training phase. The last two branches of the proposed architecture consist of dilated convolutional layers to reduce the model's computational complexity while retaining the feature maps' spatial information. The simulation results show that the proposed architecture is superior to all the state-of-the-art architecture in accuracy and sensitivity. The proposed architecture's accuracy and sensitivity are 96.5% and 96%, respectively, for each infection type. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","Binsawad, M.; Albahar, M.; Sawad, A.

The abnormal ICAT expression in mesangial cells under high glucose(HG) contributes to the development of diabetes and its complications such as diabetic nephropathy (DN). METHODS: Human mesangial cells (HMCs) were cultured in either 5.5 (normal control) or 30 (high glucose) mmol/L glucose medium. Overexpression and knock-down of ICAT or ß-catenin were carried out by transient transfection. PPARÎ³ transcriptional activity was evaluated by luciferase assay. Protein-protein interactions were tested by Coimmunoprecipitation and GST-pull down assay. Cell phenotype transition of HMCs was detected by the expression level of &#945;-SMA and fibronectin, as well as MTT assay. RESULTS: High ß-catenin protein expression but low ICAT was accompanied by low PPARÎ³ transcriptional activity in HMCs cultured in HG. By using bioinformatics prediction, protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction experimental methods, ICAT and ß-catenin were confirmed to act as coactivators in regulating PPARÎ³ transcriptional activity. Overexpression of ICAT could mitigate the decrease of PPARÎ³ transcriptional activity and partly relieve cell phenotype transition in HMCs. CONCLUSIONS: ß-catenin and ICAT interact as coactivator to modulate PPARÎ³ transcriptional activation. In HMCs cultured in HG, the low expression of ICAT leads to low PPARÎ³ transcriptional activation.","Wei, Yi; Yu, Jiawei; Zhang, Xiaopeng; Mu, Jiao; Zhang, Jun; Zeng, Wei; Feng, Bing",Exp. clin. endocrinol. diabetes,,470

Being a novel disease, current research is focused on a clearer understanding of the mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis and viable therapeutic strategies. Oxidative stress and inflammation are intertwined processes that play roles in disease progression and response to therapy via interference with multiple signaling pathways. The redox status of a host cell is an important factor in viral entry due to the unique conditions required for the conformational changes that ensure the binding and entry of a virus into the host cell. Upon entry into the airways, viral replication occurs and the innate immune system responds by activating macrophage and dendritic cells which contribute to inflammation. This review examines available literature and proposes mechanisms by which oxidative stress and inflammation could contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Further, certain antioxidants currently undergoing some form of trial in COVID-19 patients and the corresponding required research gaps are highlighted to show how targeting oxidative stress and inflammation could ameliorate COVID-19 severity.","Forcados, Gilead Ebiegberi; Muhammad, Aliyu; Oladipo, Olusola Olalekan; Makama, Sunday; Meseko, Clement Adebajo",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,470
308486,Are masks impacting psychiatric inpatients' treatment?,2020,"The objective of the study was to identify distinct patterns in inflammatory immune responses of COVID-19 patients and to investigate their association with clinical course and outcome. Data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients were retrieved from electronic medical record. Supervised k-means clustering of serial C-reactive protein levels (CRP), absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), and absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) was used to assign immune responses to one of three groups. Then, relationships between patterns of inflammatory responses and clinical course and outcome of COVID-19 were assessed in a discovery and validation cohort. Unbiased clustering analysis grouped 105 patients of a discovery cohort into three distinct clusters. Cluster 1 (hyper-inflammatory immune response) was characterized by high CRP levels, high ANC, and low ALC, whereas Cluster 3 (hypo-inflammatory immune response) was associated with low CRP levels and normal ANC and ALC. Cluster 2 showed an intermediate pattern. All patients in Cluster 1 required oxygen support whilst 61% patients in Cluster 2 and no patient in Cluster 3 required supplementary oxygen. Two (13.3%) patients in Cluster 1 died, whereas no patient in Clusters 2 and 3 died. The results were confirmed in an independent validation cohort of 116 patients. We identified three different patterns of inflammatory immune response to COVID-19. Hyper-inflammatory immune responses with elevated CRP, neutrophilia, and lymphopenia are associated with a severe disease and a worse outcome. Therefore, targeting the hyper-inflammatory response might improve the clinical outcome of COVID-19.","Lee, Eunyoung Emily; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Hwang, Woochang; Ham, Sin Young; Jeong, Hyeonju; Kim, Jeong-Han; Oh, Hong Sang; Kang, Yu Min; Lee, Eun Bong; Kim, Nam Joong; Chin, Bum Sik; Park, Jin Kyun",Sci Rep,,470

The first mechanism is the introduction of user referrals. We compare four scenarios for the uptake of CTAs-(1) the p% of individuals that use the CTA are chosen randomly, (2) a smaller initial set of randomly-chosen users each refer a contact to use the CTA, achieving p% in total, (3) a small initial set of randomly-chosen users each refer around half of their contacts to use the CTA, achieving p% in total, and (4) for comparison, an idealised scenario in which the p% of the population that uses the CTA is the p% with the most contacts. Using agent-based epidemiological models incorporating a geometric space, we find that, even when the uptake percentage p% is small, CTAs are an effective tool for mitigating the spread of the epidemic in all scenarios. Moreover, user referrals significantly improve efficacy. In addition, it turns out that user referrals reduce the quarantine load. The second mechanism for increasing the efficacy of CTAs is tuning the severity of quarantine measures. Our modelling shows that using CTAs with mild quarantine measures is effective in reducing the maximum hospital load and the number of people who become ill, but leads to a relatively high quarantine load, which may cause economic disruption. Fortunately, under stricter quarantine measures, the advantages are maintained but the quarantine load is reduced. Our models incorporate geometric inhomogeneous random graphs to study the effects of the presence of super-spreaders and of the absence of long-distant contacts (e.g., through travel restrictions) on our conclusions.","Goldberg, Leslie Ann; Jorritsma, Joost; Komjáthy, Júlia; Lapinskas, John",PLoS One,,470

Febrile neutropenia (FN) remains a major cause of hospital admissions in this population, and respiratory tract is often proven to be the site of infection even without respiratory signs and symptoms. Clinical presentation may be subtle due to impaired inflammatory response. Common respiratory viruses and bacteria are widely identified in these patients, while fungi and, less commonly, bacteria are the causative agents in more severe cases. A detailed history, thorough clinical and basic laboratory examination along with a chest radiograph are the first steps in the evaluation of a child presenting signs of a pulmonary infection. After stratifying patient's risk, prompt initiation of the appropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment is crucial and efficient for the majority of the patients. High-risk children should be treated with an intravenous antipseudomonal beta lactam agent, unless there is suspicion of multi-drug resistance when an antibiotic combination should be used. In unresponsive cases, more invasive procedures, including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), computed tomography (CT)-guided fine-needle aspiration or open lung biopsy (OLB), are recommended. Overall mortality rate can reach 20% with higher rates seen in cases unresponsive to initial therapy and those under mechanical ventilation.","Voulgaridou, Aikaterini; Athanasiadou, Kleoniki I; Athanasiadou, Eftychia; Roilides, Emmanuel; Papakonstantinou, Evgenia",,,470

The prediction can help health providers and decision makers to distinguish the states of infected patients based on their features in early intervention to take an action either by releasing or isolating the patient after the infection. The proposed approaches are evaluated using Data Science for COVID-19 (DS4C) dataset. An analysis of DS4C dataset is also provided.

This brief report aims to describe the variation of IPV reports to the police during the pandemic in Portugal. Data were retrieved from a governmental national database. A five-year period was analyzed. Characteristics from the occurrence, as well as sociodemographic characteristics of victims and perpetrators, were described for each year. Data showed a 10.99% decrease of IPV reports to the police in 2020 compared with the average of the previous four years. Periods when more restrictive measures (e.g., lockdown) were decreed by the government corresponded to a higher decrease in IPV reports to the police. Significant differences in the distribution of crime location, crime reporting, type of violence, age of victims and perpetrators, and professional situation and financial dependence of perpetrators, were found between 2020 and previous years. COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to be associated with a raise in IPV reports to the police, nor higher severity of the reported cases.

We have performed molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations of tryptophan, serotonin, and melatonin at the interface of zwitterionic phospholipid bilayers. In this work, we will review recent computer simulation developments and report microscopic properties, such as the area per lipid and thickness of the membranes, atomic radial distribution functions, angular orientations, and free energy landscapes of small molecule binding to the membrane. Cholesterol affects the behaviour of the small molecules, which are mainly buried in the interfacial regions. We have observed a competition between the binding of small molecules to phospholipids and cholesterol through lipidic hydrogen-bonds. Free energy barriers that are associated to translational and orientational changes of melatonin have been found to be between 10-20 kJ/mol for distances of 1 nm between melatonin and the center of the membrane. Corresponding barriers for tryptophan and serotonin that are obtained from reversible work methods are of the order of 10 kJ/mol and reveal strong hydrogen bonding between such species and specific phospholipid sites. The diffusion of tryptophan and melatonin is of the order of 10-7 cm2/s for the cholesterol-free and cholesterol-rich setups.","Martí, Jordi; Lu, Huixia",Int. j. mol. sci. (Online),,470

The COVID-19 pandemic poses enormous challenges to healthcare teams and patients when ensuring guideline compliance. We explored the implications of COVID-19 on physical activity levels in adult CHD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A data-based questionnaire was distributed to adult CHD patients at a regional tertiary centre from October to November 2020. RESULTS: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 96 (79.3%) of 125 respondents reported participating in regular physical activity, with 66 (52.8%) meeting target levels (moderate physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week). Commonest motivations for physical activity were general fitness (53.6%), weight loss (36.0%), and mental health benefits (30.4%). During the pandemic, the proportion that met target levels significantly decreased from 52.8% to 40.8% (p = 0.03). The commonest reason was fear of COVID-19 (28.0%), followed by loss of motivation (23.2%) and gym/fitness centre closure (15.2%). DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted exercise levels of adult CHD patients. Most do not meet recommended physical activity levels, mainly attributable to fear of COVID-19. Even before the pandemic, only half of respondents met physical activity guidelines. Availability of online classes can positively impact exercise levels so could enhance guideline compliance. This insight into health perceptions and behaviours of adult CHD patients may help develop quality improvement initiatives to improve physical activity levels in this population.","Thompson, Sophie E; Whitehead, Caitlin A; Notley, Alex S; Guy, Isabel A; Kasargod Prabhakar, Chethan R; Clift, Paul; Hudsmith, Lucy E",Cardiol Young,,470

311941,[Letter to the Editor: The Role of Medical Students in the COVID-19 Pandemic in Portugal],2020,"In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is unclear how asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected patients who present with acute severe ulcerative colitis (UC) can be treated effectively and safely. Standard treatment regimens consist of steroids, immunomodulatory drugs, and biological therapies, but therapeutic decision-making becomes challenging as there are uncertainties about how to deal with these drugs in patients with COVID-19 and active UC. Importantly, guidelines for this particular group of patients with UC are still lacking. To inform therapeutic decision-making, we describe three consecutive cases of patients with active UC and COVID-19 and discuss their treatments based on theoretical knowledge, currently available evidence and clinical observations. Three patients were identified through our national inflammatory bowel disease network [Initiative on Crohn's and Colitis (ICC)] for whom diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection was established by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in nasopharynx, stools, and/or biopsies. Acute severe UC was diagnosed by clinical parameters, endoscopy, and histopathology. Clinical guidelines for SARS-CoV-2-negative patients advocate the use of steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-antagonists as induction therapy, and experiences from the current three cases show that steroids and TNF-alpha-antagonists could also be used in patients with COVID-19. This could potentially be followed by TNF-alpha-antagonists, vedolizumab, or ustekinumab as maintenance therapy in these patients. Future research is warranted to investigate if, and which, immunomodulatory drugs should be used for COVID-19 patients that present with active UC. To answer this question, it is of utmost importance that future cases of patients with UC and COVID-19 are documented carefully in international registries, such as the SECURE-IBD registry.","Bourgonje, A.

Diagnosis has included a nasopharyngeal swab examined with PCR. Immunodominant antigens have been identified for SARS-CoV-2-the Nucleocapsid and Spike-protein antigens with known genetic sequences. It is presumed that most infected with SARS-CoV-2 will develop measurable antibody titers against the Nucleocapsid and/or Spike-protein antigens as they recover from the disease. We have developed a custom Luminex assay to measure these antibodies. We hypothesize that patients undergoing treatment for COVID-19 will develop varying levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels after infection suggesting an acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2.Methods:Following institutional review board approval, inpatients were recruited at the time of admission for COVID-19 care. Serum was collected at the time of hospital admission (Baseline, B, n=34) and at timepoints following hospital discharge: 2-weeks (2W, n=9), 6-weeks (6W, n=7), and 12-weeks (12W, n=4). Pooled convalescent serum from 5 PCR+ patients was used for positive control (POSCTRL) and serum collected prior to December 2019 from healthy preoperative patients (preCOVIDCtrl, n=48) were used for negative controls. IgG serum antibodies were measured via custom Luminex assay using SARSCoV-2 Spike S1 (S1-RBD) and Nucleocapsid human chimeric antibodies (HC2001 and HC2003, Genscript USA, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) to generate 5PL standard curves to convert Luminex median fluorescent intensity measurements into antibody concentrations. Concentrations for the different groups were analyzed using nonparametric comparisons for each group pair via Wilcoxon method. Statistical significance for all tests was set at p&lt;0.05.Results:Concentrations of S1-RBD and Nucleocapsid varied widely at time of admission (B) but were significantly higher than preCOVIDCtrl (Figure 1). Elevations at later timepoints remained significantly higher for S1-RBD and Nucleocapsid than Baseline. S1-RBD concentrations were higher at 2W and 6W than Baseline. Nucleocapsid concentrations were higher at 2W than Baseline. Later timepoints for both antibodies did not differ from POS-CTRL.Conclusions:Wide variation in anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibody levels at the time of hospital admission suggest patients were in different stages of response to the infection. Antibody levels were seen to be more uniformly elevated by 2 weeks post discharge and remained elevated consistently at the 6 and 12-week time points. The negative control sera suggest no prior exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD antigen.","Kates, S.; Owen, J. R.; Thatcher, T. H.; Sime, P.

313347,The significance of hyperglycaemia and other comorbidities during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family of coronaviruses associated with severe outbreaks of respiratory diseases in recent decades and is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The recognition by and activation of the innate immune response recruits neutrophils, which, through their different mechanisms of action, form extracellular neutrophil traps, playing a role in infection control and trapping viral, bacterial, and fungal etiological agents. However, in patients with COVID-19, activation at the vascular level, combined with other cells and inflammatory mediators, leads to thrombotic events and disseminated intravascular coagulation, thus leading to a series of clinical manifestations in cerebrovascular, cardiac, pulmonary, and kidney disease while promoting severe disease and mortality. Previous studies of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have shown that elevated levels of markers specific for NETs, such as free DNA, MPO, and H3Cit, are strongly associated with the total neutrophil count; with acute phase reactants that include CRP, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and interleukin secretion; and with an increased risk of severe COVID-19. This study analyzed the interactions between NETs and the activation pathways involved in immunothrombotic processes in patients with COVID-19.","Bautista-Becerril, Brandon; Campi-Caballero, Rebeca; Sevilla-Fuentes, Samuel; Hernández-Regino, Laura M; Hanono, Alejandro; Flores-Bustamante, Al; González-Flores, Julieta; García-Ávila, Carlos A; Aquino-Gálvez, Arnoldo; Castillejos-López, Manuel; Juárez-Cisneros, Armida; Camarena, Angel",Biomolecules,,470

The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an unprecedented global health and financial tragedy, but research is yet to establish exactly how the situation may impact on IPV. The present study investigates victims' experience of IPV during lockdown and the COVID-19 pandemic. We report a qualitative thematic analysis of 50 discussion forum posts written by victims of IPV. Of these, 48 forum posts were written by female victims of male perpetrated violence. All forum posts were obtained from the popular online platform, Reddit. We identified four themes associated with IPV victims' experiences during lockdown and the global pandemic: (i) Use of COVID-19 by the Abuser, (ii) Service Disruption, (iii) Preparation to Leave, and (iv) Factors Increasing Abuse or Distress. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on those living with IPV, often increasing the severity of IPV experienced. The experiences of those affected by IPV during this period inform interventions and the guidance and support provided to IPV victims during times of crisis.","Lyons, Minna; Brewer, Gayle",J Fam Violence,,470

Methods: Data for everyone who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Norway by end of June 2020 (N = 8569) were linked at the individual level to hospitalization, receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation treatment and death measured to end of July 2020. Underlying comorbidity was proxied by hospital-based in- or outpatient treatment during the two months before the SARS-CoV-2 test. Multivariable generalized linear models were used to assess risk ratios (RRs). Results: Risk of hospitalization was particularly high for elderly (for those aged 90 and above: RR 9.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.1-12.7; comparison group aged below 50), Norwegian residents born in Asia, Africa or Latin-America (RR 2.1; 95% CI 1.9-2.4; comparison group born in Norway), patients with underlying comorbidity (RR 1.6; 95% CI 1.4-1.8) and men (RR 1.3; 95% CI 1.2-1.5).

314410,COVID-19 Pandemic and People Who Use Opioids in India: Opportunities and Evolutions,2020,"In late March and early April, New York City was an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Citizens were ordered to stay at home to flatten the curve. The adult population was affected with a severe respiratory illness as well as acute kidney injury, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, and thromboembolism. Although children were not affected in the same manner, weeks after the peak, reports from other countries emerged about cases of pediatric patients presenting with a novel inflammatory syndrome. We present 4 patients along with their emergency department course, so providers will have a better understanding of the identification and workup of these patients. Currently, it is unclear when this inflammatory syndrome develops in respect to a COVID-19 infection. The clinical features of this syndrome seem to overlap between Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, and myocarditis. All patients presenting to our emergency department had fever, variable rash, abdominal pain, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Patients remained persistently tachycardic and febrile despite being given proper doses of antipyretics. Severity of presentations varied among the 4 cases. All 4 patients were found to have antibodies to COVID-19. All patients required admission, but 2 required the pediatric intensive care unit for cardiac and/or respiratory support or closer monitoring. Upon follow-up on our patients, it seems that most patients are recovering with treatment, and overall, there is a low reported mortality rate.","Del Greco, Giuseppina; Brady, KeriAnne; Clark, Barbara; Park, Hannah",Pediatr Emerg Care,,470

Individual user profiles are produced by platform providers to make money from tracking, predicting, exploiting and influencing their users' decision preferences and behavior, while product and service providers transform their business models by targeting potential customers with more accuracy. There have been many social and economic benefits to this digital disruption, but it has also largely contributed to the digital destruction of mental model alignment and shared situational awareness through the propagation of mis-information i.e. reinforcement of dissonant mental models by recommender algorithms, bots and trusted individual platform users (influencers). To mitigate this process of digital destruction, new methods and approaches to the centralized management of these platforms are needed to build on and encourage trust in the actors that use them (and by association trust in their mental models). The global 'infodemic' resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, highlights the current problem confronting the information system discipline and the urgency of finding workable solutions.","Bunker, Deborah",Int J Inf Manage,,470

This study aimed to investigate the distinctive CT characteristics of two stages of the disease (progression and remission). METHODS: We included all COVID-19 patients admitted to Wenzhou Central Hospital from January to February, 2020. Patients underwent multiple chest CT scans at intervals of 3-10 days. CT features were recorded, such as the lesion lobe, distribution characteristics (subpleural, scattered or diffused), shape of the lesion, maximum size of the lesion, lesion morphology (ground-glass opacity, GGO) and consolidation features. When consolidation was positive, the boundary was identified to determine its clarity. RESULTS: The ratios of some representative features differed between the remission stage and the progression phase, such as round-shape lesion (8.0% vs 34.4%), GGO (65.0% vs 87.5%), consolidation (62.0% vs 31.3%), large cable sign (59.0% vs 9.4%) and crazy-paving sign (20.0% vs 50.0%). Using these features, we pooled all the CT data (n = 132) and established a logistic regression model to predict the current development stage. The variables consolidation, boundary feature, large cable sign and crazy-paving sign were the most significant factors, based on a variable named ""prediction of progression or remission"" (PPR) that we constructed. The ROC curve showed that PPR had an AUC of 0.882 (cutoff value = 0.66, sensitivity = 0.75, specificity = 0.875). CONCLUSION: CT characteristics, in particular, round shape, GGO, consolidation, large cable sign, and crazy-paving sign, may increase the recognition of the intrapulmonary development of COVID-19.","Liao, Jie-Lan; Chen, Yu; Huang, Chong-Quan; He, Gui-Qing; Du, Ji-Cheng; Chen, Que-Lu",Int J Clin Pract,,470

However, it is important to measure whether the population is receiving information that calms it down, as well as whether such news are in accordance with the magnitude of the issue. Objective: To validate a questionnaire that measures the perception of the media and their informative role in the face of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A validation process for a questionnaire that measures the perception of the magnitude of this issue and whether it generates fear was carried out. The validation was performed by means of a literature search. Moreover, a first version of the scale was developed, which was assessed by 30 experts (physicians, epidemiologists, among others). After this, an exploratory factor analysis and descriptive statistics were performed. Results: Our scale had 13 initial items; however, one of them was eliminated because of its unsatisfactory level of statistical adequacy. Exploratory factorial analysis and parallel analysis suggested three factors. Results of the KMO coefficient (0.833) and the Bartlett’s test of sphericity (4998.5; gl = 66; p&lt;0.001) were acceptable and significant, which justify the exploratory factorial analysis. The correlation between the factors was &gt;0.4 and robust analyses revealed a satisfactory factorial structure (X2=88.0; p= 0.001; IFC=0.968; GFI=0.992; TLI=0.937; RMSEA=0.123). In the descriptive statistics of the 12 final items, moderate and significant correlations between the items were reported (&gt; 0.5).

319820,The mental state and risk factors of Chinese medical staff and medical students in early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic,2020,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an illness associated with intersectional poverty and stigma in old age; people with COPD are susceptible to anxiety, loneliness and isolation. People with COPD who contract COVID-19 are at high risk of serious complications, intensive medical needs and death and are, therefore, required to socially distance particularly assiduously. This paper offers an embodied phenomenological analysis of the emerging theoretical literature exploring the impact of social distancing upon people with COPD. Firstly, people with COPD are aware of how respiratory illness feels, are anxious about COVID-19 and afraid of being denied care. Future research might consider how people with COPD may be susceptible to ""coronaphobia"" and mental health consequences of the pandemic. Secondly, COPD tends to affect older people within the most intersectionally marginalised socioeconomic groups. Future research should remain mindful that people with COPD may be among the most lonely and least able to access health and social care services online than others. Thirdly, pandemics are known to intensify pre-existing social stigmas. Researchers and practitioners alike should be conscious that people with COPD may become increasingly stigmatised, especially those from intersectionally disadvantaged minorities.","Yoeli, Heather",Soc Theory Health,,470
320030,Safety and Efficacy of Different Therapeutic Interventions on Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19,2020,"Globally, there are prevailing knowledge gaps in the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection among children and adolescents; however, these gaps are especially wide in African countries. The availability of robust age-disaggregated data is a critical first step in improving knowledge on disease burden and manifestations of COVID-19 among children. Furthermore, it is essential to improve understanding of SARS-CoV-2 interactions with comorbidities and co-infections such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, sickle cell disease and malnutrition, which are highly prevalent among children in sub-Saharan Africa. The African Forum for Research and Education in Health (AFREhealth) COVID-19 Research Collaboration on Children and Adolescents is conducting studies across Western, Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa to address existing knowledge gaps. This consortium is expected to generate key evidence to inform clinical practice and public health policymaking for COVID-19, while concurrently addressing other major diseases affecting children in African countries.","Sam-Agudu, Nadia A; Rabie, Helena; Pipo, Michel Tshiasuma; Byamungu, Liliane Nsuli; Masekela, Refiloe; van der Zalm, Marieke M; Redfern, Andrew; Dramowski, Angela; Mukalay, Abdon; Gachuno, Onesmus W; Mongweli, Nancy; Kinuthia, John; Ishoso, Daniel Katuashi; Amoako, Emmanuella; Agyare, Elizabeth; Agbeno, Evans K; Jibril, Aishatu Mohammed; Abdullahi, Asara M; Amadi, Oma; Umar, Umar Mohammed; Ayele, Birhanu T; Machekano, Rhoderick N; Nyasulu, Peter S; Hermans, Michel P; Otshudiema, John Otokoye; Bongo-Pasi Nswe, Christian; Kayembe, Jean-Marie N; Mbala-Kingebeni, Placide; Muyembe-Tamfum, Jean-Jacques; Aanyu, Hellen Tukamuhebwa; Musoke, Philippa; Fowler, Mary Glenn; Sewankambo, Nelson; Suleman, Fatima; Adejumo, Prisca; Tsegaye, Aster; Mteta, Alfred; Noormahomed, Emilia V; Deckelbaum, Richard J; Zumla, Alimuddin; Mavungu Landu, Don Jethro; Tshilolo, Léon; Zigabe, Serge; Goga, Ameena; Mills, Edward J; Umar, Lawal W; Kruger, Mariana; Mofenson, Lynne M; Nachega, Jean B",Clin. infect. dis,,470

I merged 2018 US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) national employment and wage data with measures ranking the importance of computer use at work and the importance of working with or performing for the public from the BLS O*NET survey.Results. Approximately 25% (35.6 million) of US workers are employed in occupations (such as technology, administrative, financial, and engineering) that could be done from home; the remaining 75% work in occupations (including health care, manufacturing, retail, and food services) that are challenging to do from home.Conclusions. Most US workers are employed in occupations that cannot be done at home, putting 108.4 million workers at increased risk for adverse health outcomes related to working during a pandemic. These workers tend to be lower paid. The stress experienced by lower-income groups, coupled with job insecurity, could result in a large burden of mental health disorders in the United States in addition to increased cases of COVID-19 from workplace transmission.

(Special Issue: COVID-19 health system response.)",2020,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all schools in various countries have implemented online learning. The learning model that is known by education practitioners applies more teaching in class with clear and systematic learning steps, such as hand-on activities, observation, and direct assessment by the teacher. Of course, this is a problem, and it is not appropriate if the learning model in conventional classrooms brought to the virtual classroom. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the Advance Organizer learning model designed for virtual classes to empower the ability of chemical literacy in aspects of knowledge. This research method is quasi-experimental. The results of this study indicate that there is a significant influence on students' chemical literacy abilities using the ""advance organizer E-Learning""model. Research data shows that the ability of chemical literacy is increasing in aspects of student knowledge. It can see from the pretest and posttest results in the experimental virtual class. The results of the t-test analysis testis seen from significant influence, where the analysis of t-test values &gt; or significant values &lt; significant level (0.05) is equal to 21.923 &gt; 2.047. Increased cognitive abilities of experimental class students can be seen from the average results of students in the pretest which is 47.20, and increase after treatment with the posttest mean results to 81.00, meaning that there is a pretty good increase in the ability of chemical literacy in the aspects of knowledge due to the influence of the ""Advance Organizer E-Learning""model.

323229,“Of Course We Need to Help the Undocumented Immigrants!”: Twitter Discourse on the (Un)deservingness of Undocumented Immigrants in the United States during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE: Because of the unprecedented disruption of health care services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) identified an urgent need to issue practice recommendations for radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer (HNC) in a time of limited resources and heightened risk for patients and staff. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A panel of international experts from ASTRO, ESTRO, and select Asia-Pacific countries completed a modified rapid Delphi process. Topics and questions were presented to the group, and subsequent questions were developed from iterative feedback. Each survey was open online for 24 hours, and successive rounds started within 24 hours of the previous round. The chosen cutoffs for strong agreement (&#8805;80%) and agreement (&#8805;66%) were extrapolated from the RAND methodology. Two pandemic scenarios, early (risk mitigation) and late (severely reduced radiation therapy resources), were evaluated. The panel developed treatment recommendations for 5 HNC cases. RESULTS: In total, 29 of 31 of those invited (94%) accepted, and after a replacement 30 of 30 completed all 3 surveys (100% response rate). There was agreement or strong agreement across a number of practice areas, including treatment prioritization, whether to delay initiation or interrupt radiation therapy for intercurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection, approaches to treatment (radiation dose-fractionation schedules and use of chemotherapy in each pandemic scenario), management of surgical cases in event of operating room closures, and recommended adjustments to outpatient clinic appointments and supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: This urgent practice recommendation was issued in the knowledge of the very difficult circumstances in which our patients find themselves at present, navigating strained health care systems functioning with limited resources and at heightened risk to their health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this consensus statement is to ensure high-quality HNC treatments continue, to save lives and for symptomatic benefit.","Thomson, David J; Palma, David; Guckenberger, Matthias; Balermpas, Panagiotis; Beitler, Jonathan J; Blanchard, Pierre; Brizel, David; Budach, Wilfred; Caudell, Jimmy; Corry, June; Corvo, Renzo; Evans, Mererid; Garden, Adam S; Giralt, Jordi; Gregoire, Vincent; Harari, Paul M; Harrington, Kevin; Hitchcock, Ying J; Johansen, Jorgen; Kaanders, Johannes; Koyfman, Shlomo; Langendijk, J A; Le, Quynh-Thu; Lee, Nancy; Margalit, Danielle; Mierzwa, Michelle; Porceddu, Sandro; Soong, Yoke Lim; Sun, Ying; Thariat, Juliette; Waldron, John; Yom, Sue S",Radiother Oncol,,470

We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF from stool and urine AlereLipoarabinomannan [LAM] test in this group of children. METHODS: Hospitalised children with presumptive TB and either age <2â years, HIV-positive or severe malnutrition were enrolled in a diagnostic cohort. At enrolment, we attempted to collect two urine, two stool and two respiratory samples. Urine and stool were tested with AlereLAM and Xpert MTB/RIF, respectively. Respiratory samples were tested with Xpert MTB/RIF and mycobacterial culture. Both a microbiological and a composite clinical reference standard were used. RESULTS: The study enrolled 219 children; median age 16.4â months, 72 (32.9%) HIV-positive and 184 (84.4%) severely malnourished. Twelve (5.5%) and 58 (28.5%) children had confirmed and unconfirmed TB respectively. Stool and urine were collected in 219 (100%) and 216 (98.6%) children. Against the microbiological reference standard the sensitivity and specificity (n/N, 95% confidence intervals) of stool Xpert MTB/RIF was 50.0% (6/12, 21.1-78.9) and 99.1% (198/200 96.4-99.9), while that of urine AlereLAM was 50.0% (6/12, 21.1-78.9) and 74.6% (147/197, 67.9-80.5) respectively. Against the composite reference standard sensitivity was reduced to 11.4% (8/70) for stool and 26.2% (17/68) for urine, with no major difference by age group (<2 and >2â years) or HIV status. CONCLUSION: The Xpert MTB/RIF assay has excellent specificity on stool, but sensitivity is suboptimal. Urine AlereLAM is compromised by poor sensitivity and specificity in children.","Orikiriza, Patrick; Smith, Julianna; Ssekyanzi, Bob; Nyehangane, Dan; Mugisha Taremwa, Ivan; Turyashemererwa, Esther; Byamukama, Onesmas; Tusabe, Tobias; Ardizzoni, Elisa; Marais, Ben J; Wobudeya, Eric; Kemigisha, Elizabeth; Mwanga-Amumpaire, Juliet; Nampijja, Dora; Bonnet, Maryline",Eur. respir. j,,470

323764,Coronaphobia and chronophobia - A psychiatric perspective,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Living during the COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by the emergence of great uncertainty surrounding multiple aspects of daily life. This study explored the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and depression, as well as the potential mediation effect of COVID-19-related fear. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey from 10 April until 13 April 2020, three weeks after a national lockdown had been imposed in Greece. The convenience sample used in this study consisted of 2,827 adults. Participants voluntarily provided sociodemographic data and completed the following scales: the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12), the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), and the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) Depression Scale. RESULTS: Participants appeared to be moderately depressed [M = 14.75, SD = 4.52]. There was a significant indirect effect of IU to depressive symptoms ((.058), CI (0.051-0.066)). FCV-19S was tested as a mediator in the relationship between IUS-12 (independent variable) and PHQ-9 (dependent variable). Partial mediation of fear of COVID-19 was supported ((.54) (.41) = 13, CI (0.051-0.066), Sobel z-value = 14.93). CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptomatology affected study participants at a moderate level. IU was shown to be a significant predictor of depressive symptomatology with higher levels of IU being associated with more severe depressive symptoms. Fear of COVID-19 partially mediated this association. The mediation effect may be explained by the uncertainty around COVID-19-related health issues, which are reflected in the FCV-19S and cause worry and/or anxiety. Uncertainty related with other factors, such as the impact on the economy and education, not assessed by the FCV-19S, may explain part of the relationship between IU and depressive symptoms that is not mediated by FCV-19S. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Intolerance of uncertainty is related to depressive symptomatology, and fear of COVID-19 explains part of the relation. Fear of COVID-19 indicates worry and anxiety related to health issues. Psychotherapeutic interventions enhancing individuals' capacity to endure uncertainty could be beneficial. Provision of simple and clear information by the authorities should be a priority issue.","Voitsidis, Panteleimon; Nikopoulou, Vasiliki Aliki; Holeva, Vasiliki; Parlapani, Eleni; Sereslis, Konstantinos; Tsipropoulou, Virginia; Karamouzi, Panayiota; Giazkoulidou, Aikaterini; Tsopaneli, Nektaria; Diakogiannis, Ioannis",Psychol. psychother,,470
324087,Two to tango: Deconstructing the COVID-19 and suicidality conundrum from a biopsychosocial perspective,2020,"Accurate, reliable and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 is essential not only for correct diagnosis of individual COVID-19 disease but also for the development of a rational strategy aimed at lifting confinement restrictions and preparing for possible recurrent waves of viral infections. We have used the MIQE guidelines to develop two versions of a unique five plex RT-qPCR test, termed CoV2-ID, that allows the detection of three viral target genes, a human internal control for confirming the presence of human cells in a sample and a control artificial RNA for quality assessment and potential quantification. Viral targets can be detected either individually with separate fluorophores or jointly using the same fluorophore, thus increasing the test's reliability and sensitivity. It is robust, can consistently detect two copies of viral RNA, with a limit of detection of a single copy and can be completed in around 15 min. It was 100% sensitive and 100% specific when tested on 23 RNA samples extracted from COVID-19 positive patients and five COVID-19 negative patients. We also propose using multiple cycle fluorescence detection, rather than real-time PCR to reduce significantly the time taken to complete the assay as well as assuage the misunderstandings underlying the use of quantification cycles (Cq). Finally, we have designed an assay for the detection of the D614G mutation and show that all of the samples isolated in the Chelmsford, Essex area between mid-April and June 2020, have the mutant genotype whereas a sample originating in Australia was infected with the wild type genotype.","Bustin, Stephen; Coward, Amy; Sadler, Garry; Teare, Louise; Nolan, Tania",Sci Rep,,470

We describe the epidemiology and outcomes of RVI in a cohort enrolling 3294 consecutive patients undergoing SOT from May 2008 to December 2015 in Switzerland. Patient and allograft outcomes, and RVI diagnosed during routine clinical practice were prospectively collected. Median follow-up was 3.4 years (interquartile range 1.61-5.56). Six hundred ninety-six RVIs were diagnosed in 151/334 (45%) lung and 265/2960 (9%) non-lung transplant recipients. Cumulative incidence was 60% (95% confidence interval [CI] 53%-69%) in lung and 12% (95% CI 11%-14%) in non-lung transplant recipients. RVI led to 17.9 (95% CI 15.7-20.5) hospital admissions per 1000 patient-years. Intensive care unit admission was required in 4% (27/691) of cases. Thirty-day all-cause case fatality rate was 0.9% (6/696). Using proportional hazard models we found that RVI (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.45; 95% CI 1.62-3.73), lower respiratory tract RVI (aHR 3.45; 95% CI 2.15-5.52), and influenza (aHR 3.57; 95% CI 1.75-7.26) were associated with graft failure or death.

PURPOSE: This study examined the relations of pseudoscientific and just world beliefs, generalized and institutional trust, and political party affiliation to adherence to COVID-19 social distancing guidelines over three months, as well as the explanatory role of COVID-19 risk perceptions in these relations. METHODS: A U.S. nationwide sample of 430 adults (49.8% women; mean age = 40.72) completed a prospective online study, including an initial assessment (between March 27 and April 5, 2020), a 1 month follow-up (between April 27 and May 21, 2020), and a 3 month follow-up (between June 26 and July 15, 2020). We hypothesized that greater pseudoscientific and just world beliefs, lower governmental, institutional, and dispositional trust, and Republican Party affiliation would be associated with lower initial adherence to social distancing and greater reductions in social distancing over time and that COVID-19 risk perceptions would account for significant variance in these relations. RESULTS: Results revealed unique associations of lower governmental trust, greater COVID-19 pseudoscientific beliefs, and greater trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to lower initial adherence to social distancing. Whereas greater COVID-19 risk perceptions and CDC trust were associated with less steep declines in social distancing over time, both Republican (vs. Democratic) Party affiliation and greater COVID-19 pseudoscientific beliefs were associated with steeper declines in social distancing over time (relations accounted for by lower COVID-19 risk perceptions). CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the utility of public health interventions aimed at improving scientific literacy and emphasizing bipartisan support for social distancing guidelines.","Gratz, Kim L; Richmond, Julia R; Woods, Sherry E; Dixon-Gordon, Katherine L; Scamaldo, Kayla M; Rose, Jason P; Tull, Matthew T",Ann Behav Med,,470

As of October 2020, more than 44 million confirmed cases and more than 1,160,000 deaths have been reported globally, and the toll is likely to be much higher before the pandemic is over. There are currently little therapeutic options available and new potential targets are intensively investigated. Recently, Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) has emerged as an interesting candidate. Elevated levels of BTK activity have been reported in blood monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19, compared with those from healthy volunteers. Importantly, various studies confirmed empirically that administration of BTK inhibitors (acalabrutinib and ibrutinib) decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality rate for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Herein, we review the current information regarding the role of BTK in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections and the suitability of its inhibitors as drugs to treat COVID-19. The use of BTK inhibitors in the management of COVID-19 shows promise in reducing the severity of the immune response to the infection and thus mortality.

Nowhere are these stereotypes and expectations more apparent than for mothers. However, some social media are exploiting mothers by inappropriately offering alcohol consumption as a solution to the challenges of parenting. This is a very timely topic, given the impacts of COVID-19 on family and home life, and potential for an increase in alcohol-related problems and health harms.

327510,Strategies to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Wastewater testing offers a cost-effective strategy for measuring population disease prevalence and health behaviors. For COVID-19, wastewater surveillance addresses testing gaps and provides an early warning for outbreaks. As U.S. federal agencies build a National Wastewater Surveillance System around the pandemic, thinking through ways to develop flexible frameworks for wastewater sampling, testing, and reporting can avoid unnecessary system overhauls for future infectious disease, chronic disease, and drug epidemics. OBJECTIVES: We discuss ways to transform a historically academic exercise into a tool for epidemic response. We generalize lessons learned by a global network of wastewater researchers around validation and implementation for COVID-19 and opioids while also drawing on our experience with wastewater-based epidemiology in the United States. DISCUSSION: Sustainable wastewater surveillance requires coordination between health and safety officials, utilities, labs, and researchers. Adapting sampling frequency, type, and location to threat level, community vulnerability, biomarker properties, and decisions that wastewater data will inform can increase the practical value of the data. Marketplace instabilities, coupled with a fragmented testing landscape due to specialization, may require officials to engage multiple labs to test for known and unknown threats. Government funding can stabilize the market, balancing commercial pressures with public good, and incentivize data sharing. When reporting results, standardizing metrics and contextualizing wastewater data with health resource data can provide insights into a community's vulnerability and identify strategies to prevent health care systems from being overwhelmed. If wastewater data will inform policy decisions for an entire community, comparing characteristics of the wastewater treatment plant's service population to those of the larger community can help determine whether the wastewater data are generalizable. Ethical protocols may be needed to protect privacy and avoid stigmatization. With data-driven approaches to sample collection, analysis, and interpretation, officials can use wastewater surveillance for adaptive resource allocation, pandemic management, and program evaluation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8572.","Keshaviah, Aparna; Hu, Xindi C; Henry, Marisa",Environ Health Perspect,,470

This can help in understanding of appearance of more complicated dynamics, for example, chaos etc. The density dependent population growth is also considered. It is presented that pathogens can invade in population and their invasion depends on the carrying capacity $K$ which shows that the progression of disease in population depends on carrying capacity.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of the western Uganda community on the proper use of face masks to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using a structured questionnaire was carried out from 1st July to 10th July 2020 among western Ugandans of consent age of 18 years and above. Data was analysed using Stata version 14.2. RESULTS: Among the respondents (n = 1114), the mean age was 30.7 (SD 11.1), 51% were males, 53.9% married and 43% had attained secondary education. Most participants (60.1%, n = 670) had satisfactory knowledge on the use of face masks and participants at a tertiary education level [AOR 2.6 (95% CI: 1.42-4.67; p = 0.002)] were likely to have satisfactory knowledge than participants who had not education. On attitude, most respondents (69.4%) were confident enough to correctly put on a face mask; 83.4% believed that a face mask can protect against COVID-19 and 75.9% of respondents had never shared their face mask. The majority of respondents (95.2%) agreed wearing face masks in public places was important to protect themselves against COVID-19; 60.3% reported washing their hands before wearing and after removing the face mask. Unfortunately, 51.5% reported removing the face mask if they needed to talk to someone. CONCLUSION: Despite the satisfactory knowledge, good attitude and practices, there is still much more to be done in terms of knowledge, attitude and practices among participants. Government, non-governmental organizations and civil society should improve sensitization of populations on how to behave with face masks while talking to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 among western Ugandans.","Sikakulya, Franck Katembo; Ssebuufu, Robinson; Mambo, Simon Binezero; Pius, Theophilus; Kabanyoro, Annet; Kamahoro, Elizabeth; Mulumba, Yusuf; Muhongya, Jean Kakule; Kyamanywa, Patrick",PLoS One,,470

331170,The association between socioeconomic status and mobility reductions in the early stage of England's COVID-19 epidemic,2021,"The calibration method based on integrated modeling with intrinsic and extrinsic parameters is widely used for star sensors. However, the unified optimization of parameters results in the coupling between intrinsic and extrinsic parameters in this method, further influencing the calibration accuracy of the intrinsic parameters and causing certain limitations for the practical applications involving precise extrinsic parameters. A novel calibration method for star sensors with separation of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters is proposed in this paper to solve the issue. Firstly, the coupling form of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters in the integrated calibration model is analyzed, and the coupling degree is analyzed through the partial correlation coefficient (PCC). Then, on the basis of the analysis results, combined with the applications of star sensors in satellites and missiles, the extrinsic parameters coupled with the intrinsic parameters are separated individually, and the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters without coupling are optimized nonlinearly as a whole. The experimental results verify the validity of the proposed method.","Fan, Qiaoyun; He, Kangkang; Wang, Gangyi",Opt Express,,470

333860,Biobehavioral Aspects of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review,2021,"Neurodegeneration is a gradual mechanism of neuronal loss arising from numerous cellular and molecular events such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, and the consequence of these processes is neuroplasticity impairment, cognitive diseases, mood-related diseases, and normal cellular activity. Over the last year, major advances have been made in the field of the introduction of herbal compounds with neuroprotective efficacy, one of which is curcumin. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is the most abundant turmeric component extracted from the Curcuma longa plant rhizomes. Accumulating evidence indicates that curcumin may induce mitochondrial biogenesis and can function as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic agent, which may be used effectively to treat chronic neurodegenerative diseases and any situation in which the neurodegeneration process takes place. Curcumin has been shown to play a critical role in activating two essential signaling pathways phosphatidylinositol-3(PI3)/ protein kinase B(Akt)/ glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and PI3/Akt/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and preventing the incidence of neurodegeneration via these two pathways. Curcumin's protective functions against neural cell degeneration due to mitochondrial dysfunction and consequent events such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in neural cells have been documented and clinical data have increased to suggest that curcumin may be a standard candidate as a neuroprotective agent. Therefore, in this review, we summarized the clinical and experimental studies and interpreted the key contributory mechanisms of neuroprotective properties of curcumin in neurodegenerative diseases and disorders. We also tried to understand the function of PI3/Akt/GSK3 and PI3/Akt/CREB/BDNF signaling pathways in the neuroprotective properties of curcumin and tried to evaluate their association with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis and biogenesis effects of mitochondria.","Kandezi, Niyoosha; Mohammadi, Mahsa; Ghaffari, Maryam; Gholami, Mina; Motaghinejad, Majid; Safari, Sepideh",Int J Mol Cell Med,,470

RESULTS: The multivariate stepwise logistic model demonstrated that age of 60+ years (OR =4.426, 95% CI: 1.955-10.019), comorbidity of cerebrovascular disease (OR =7.084, 95% CI: 1.545-32.471), white blood cell (WBC) count >9.5×109/L (OR =7.308, 95% CI: 1.650-32.358), platelet count <125×109/L (OR =5.128, 95% CI: 2.157-12.191), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >40 U/L (OR =2.554, 95% CI: 1.253-5.206), cystatin C >1.1 mg/L (OR =4.132, 95% CI: 2.118-8.059), C reactive protein (CRP) &#8805;100 mg/L (OR =2.830, 95% CI: 1.311-6.109), creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB) >24 U/L (OR =6.015, 95% CI: 2.119-17.07) and D-dimer >5 µg/L (OR =4.917, 95% CI: 1.619-14.933) were independent predictors of mortality of COVID-19 patients. The nomogram demonstrated a well discriminatory accuracy for mortality prediction with a C-index of 0.903. CONCLUSIONS: The determinants identified may help to determine patients at high risk of death at an early stage and guide the optimal treatment.","Li, Jian; Yang, Luyu; Zeng, Qian; Li, Qingyun; Yang, Zhitao; Han, Lizhong; Huang, Xiaodong; Chen, Erzhen",Ann Palliat Med,,470

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study conducted in an academic fertility centre. Online questionnaires were distributed between 18 April 2020 and 23 April 2020 to patients whose treatment cycle had been postponed or discontinued. The outcome measures included agreement with the reproductive society guidelines to postpone treatments; willingness to resume treatments, given the choice; patients' emotional reactions; and psychological distress level, measured by the Mental Health Inventory validated scale. A multivariate linear regression was conducted to identify factors associated with psychological distress. RESULTS: Because of the small number of male respondents, only women were included in the analysis (nâ¯=â¯181). Forty-three per cent expressed disagreement with the guidelines and 82% were willing to resume treatments, given the choice. Sadness and anxiety were the most common emotional reactions expressed towards the guidelines. In the multivariate analysis, COVID-19-related anxiety (Bâ¯=â¯0.145, Pâ¯=â¯0.04) and disagreement with treatment suspension (Bâ¯=â¯-0.44, Pâ¯=â¯0.001) were found to be significantly associated with patients' psychological distress. Background characteristics of patients did not contribute significantly to their distress. CONCLUSIONS: Suspension of fertility treatment during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with patients' negative emotional reactions. Anxiety related to COVID-19 and disagreement with treatment suspension were found to be significantly associated with psychological distress among women undergoing fertility treatment, regardless of their background characteristics. Our findings suggest the need to monitor the mental health of patients and provide psychological support should a shutdown of fertility care re-occur.","Marom Haham, Lilach; Youngster, Michal; Kuperman Shani, Adi; Yee, Samantha; Ben-Kimhy, Reut; Medina-Artom, Tamar R; Hourvitz, Ariel; Kedem, Alon; Librach, Clifford",Reprod. biomed. online,,470

Physical activity seemed to be a factor that could prevent mental disorders such as anxiety or depression in this peculiar situation. Therefore, the aims of this study were to explore how teachers have been affected by the lockdown with respect to their mental health and their relationships in three main fields: work, family, and social relationships, and to know which is the role of physical activity in the mentioned variables. For that purpose, an online survey was designed to collect quantitative and qualitative data. Results showed that indoor physical activity acts as preventive in lockdown situations, whereas the level of activity does not affect mental health. Also, teachers have experienced higher levels of distress due to the workload generated during the lockdown. In conclusion, to prevent health problems among teachers in future similar situations, it would be important to facilitate the practice of physical activity at home. Furthermore, teacher training in blended or online educational methods would be crucial for their favorable work development.","Aperribai, Leire; Cortabarria, Lorea; Aguirre, Triana; Verche, Emilio; Borges, África",Front Psychol,,470

Many objective measures of gland distortion were previously proposed allowing for user-independent classification of acquired gland images. However, due to the complicated nature of gland deformation, none of the single-valued parameters can fully describe the analyzed gland images. There is a need to increase the number of descriptive factors, selectively sensitive to different gland features. Here we show that global 2D Fourier transform analysis of infra-red gland images provides values of two new such parameters: mean gland frequency and anisotropy in gland periodicity. We show that their values correlate with gland dysfunction and can be used to automatically categorize the images into the three subjective classes (healthy, intermediate and unhealthy). We also demonstrated that classification performance can be improved by dimensionality reduction approach using principal component analysis.","Ciezar, K; Pochylski, M",Ocular surf,,470

CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccine safety and side-effects concerns impact nurses' intentions to accept the vaccine and may result in low acceptance rates. Urgent action is needed to address these fears and raise confidence, as nurses' vaccine-related decisions can affect the public's vaccine acceptance.","Rabi, Razan; Maraqa, Beesan; Nazzal, Zaher; Zink, Therese",Public health nurs,,470

343084,The prevalence of exposure to potentially morally injurious events among physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Aim: In addition to its respiratory impact of SARS-CoV2, skin lesions of probable vascular origin have been described. This study intends to quantify the incidence of acro-ischemic lesions in COVID-19 infected adult subjects in our population, describing clinical patterns and associated findings. Methods: All adult confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection who presented with acro-ischemic lesions and received care in our institution were prospectively enrolled up to May 15th, 2020. The variables included demographics, comorbidities, analytical parameters, clinical presentations and COVID-19 treatment. Results: We enrolled 24 patients. The overall rate of acro-ischemic findings in COVID-19 patients was 1.2% [0.6% for outpatients and 2.9% for hospitalized (ICU and non-ICU patients)], but the observed incidence for acro-ischemia in ICU patients was remarkably higher (23.0%, p<0.001). We have described four different clinical patterns of acroischemia: atypical Raynaud´s phenomenon (ARP), (4); pseudo-pernio (PP), (5); severe microcirculatory ischemia with preserved pulse (SMI), (6); and dry gangrene with arteriosclerosis obliterans (AO), (9). Kendall´s &#964; correlation with lung disease severity was 0.877 (95% CI, 0.756 to 0.968); p<0.01). ARP individuals were predominantly female, while SMI appeared lately in elderly hospitalized subjects with better prognosis. AO occurred in patients with more comorbidity and younger than those with SMI. We observed other associated lesions of suggestive ischemic nature in other organs in all groups (15 patients of total sample). Plasma procalcitonin was significantly higher in patients who developed SMI (median and interquartile range: 9.99 (4.2, 12.3) mg/mL vs 0.26 (0.11, 0.89) mg/mL; p<0.001), and D-dimer level at hospital admission was significantly higher in AO patients (median and interquartile range: 1166 (1050, 2111) mg/L vs 502 (448, 777) mg/L; p<0.001). Conclusion: The observed risk for acroischemia in COVID-19 is high in ICU patients (23%). We have described four different clinical patterns of acroischemia (ARP, PP, SMI and AO) associated with lung disease severity. Authors have communicated various lesions of suggestive ischemic nature in other organs. Raynaud-like pattern is reported as a ""novelty"".","Alonso, María Noelia; Mata-Forte, Tatiana; García-León, Natalia; Vullo, Paula Agostina; Ramirez-Olivencia, Germán; Estébanez, Miriam; Álvarez-Marcos, Francisco",Vasc Health Risk Manag,,470

Where are the patients?,2021,"ABSTRACT Objective: To carry out a scoping review of the meta-analyses published regarding about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), evaluating their main characteristics, publication trends and methodological quality. Methods: A bibliometric search was performed in PubMed®, Scopus and Web of Science, focusing on meta-analyses about COVID-2019 disease. Bibliometric and descriptive data for the included articles were extracted and the methodological quality of the included meta-analyses was evaluated using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews. Results: A total of 348 meta-analyses were considered eligible. The first meta-analysis about COVID-19 disease was published on February 26, 2020, and the number of meta-analyses has grown rapidly since then. Most of them were published in infectious disease and virology journals. The greatest number come from China, followed by the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom. On average, these meta-analyses included 23 studies and 15,200 participants. Overall quality was remarkably low, and only 8.9% of them could be considered as of high confidence level. Conclusion: Although well-designed meta-analyses about COVID-19 disease have already been published, the majority are of low quality. Thus, all stakeholders playing a role in COVID-19 deseases, including policy makers, researchers, publishers and journals, should prioritize well-designed meta-analyses, performed only when the background information seem suitable, and discouraging those of low quality or that use suboptimal methods.","Pires, Gabriel Natan; Bezerra, Andréia Gomes; Oliveira, Thainá Baenninger de; Chen, Samuel Fen I; Malfatti, Victor Davis Apostolakis; Mello, Victoria Feiner Ferreira de; Niyama, Alyne; Pinto, Vitor Luiz Selva; Andersen, Monica Levy; Tufik, Sergio",Einstein (Säo Paulo),,470
343317,Temperament and character of patients with alcohol toxicity during COVID - 19 pandemic,2021,"Purpose: Two months after its first COVID-19 case, Italy counted more than 190,000 confirmed positive cases. From the beginning of April 2020, the nationwide lockdown started to show early effects by reducing the total cumulative incidence reached by the epidemic wave. Here we provide the reproduction number estimation both in space and in time from February 24 to April 24, 2020 over 2 months into the epidemic. Methods: The aim of the present work was to provide a systematical mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics spread to all regions of Italy. To do so, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), by using the maximum likelihood estimation method in the early stage of the epidemic. In addition, we determined time evolution of this parameter across the 2 months of the observational period. Finally, we linked R t , with two indices, the first representing the number of contagious people and the latter the density of susceptibiltiy to infection of people in a region as recorded on April 24, 2020. Results: Our estimates suggest a basic reproduction number averaged over all the regions of 3.29. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics reported here, we gave a quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of the government measures to lower the reproduction number below 1 (control regime). We estimated that the worst-hit regions in Italy reached the control regime level (R t < 1) in about a month. Conclusion: Our work was carried out in the period between April and July,2020. We found that the mean value of time to reach the control regime across the whole country was about 31 days from February 24, 2020. Moreover, we highlighted the interplay between the reproduction number and two epidemiological/demographic indices to evaluate the ""state of activity"" of the epidemic, potentially helping in challenging decisions to continue, ease, or tighten restrictions.

343835,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance use and access to HIV prevention in Ukraine,2021,"It is becoming increasingly recognized that the tumor microenvironment significantly contributes to the development, progression, and metastasis of cancer and also plays a role in response to treatment. The tumor microenvironment is a complex and heterogeneous niche comprised of stromal cells, cancer cells, blood vessels, areas of hypoxia and necrotic tissue, fibrosis, and extracellular matrix. Cellular communication takes place within the tumor microenvironment, both via cell to cell contact, and through extracellular mechanisms such as exosomal signaling. Exosomes are very small membrane-bound vesicles that have been shown to play key roles in the progression of cancer including modulation of the tumor microenvironment through the induction of angiogenesis, the transfer of genetic information that confers drug resistance, and increased cell migration, invasion, proliferation, and survival, as well as the modulation of immune cell interactions. The role of exosomes in several different cancers has been investigated. In the context of osteosarcoma, understanding how exosomes may modulate the tumor microenvironment to support metastatic growth particularly in the lung, the most common site of metastases, may identify novel therapeutic targets for relapsed patients.","Wolf-Dennen, Kerri; Kleinerman, Eugenie S",Adv Exp Med Biol,,470

This article focuses on the alternative and rival concept of a “smart quarantine”, which emerged at the beginning of the lockdown. Inspired by Korean and Singaporean anti-COVID-19 smart city solutions, a group of ICT professionals volunteered to develop a system that promised to help limit the spread of the infection and, at the same time, ease the nationwide lockdown within a foreseeable time. The idea was received enthusiastically, yet, two months later, smart solutions are still not fully integrated. This article reconstructs the story of the smart quarantine in Czechia and suggests considering possible societal consequences of unsatisfactorily valid smart tracing methodologies. Rather than seeing lockdown and smart solutions as opposite approaches to the current risk, it shows that a hybrid strategy may be considered, if not necessary, especially in contexts where smart solutions have been previously applied only to a limited extent.","Kouřil, Petr; Ferenčuhová, Slavomíra",Eurasian Geogr.

She presented with frequency and urgency for 10 months duration 5 years into conservative management. Her symptoms did not improve on anticholinergics and lifestyle modifications. She underwent an opportunistic change of pessary under general anaesthesia coincidental to scalp wound debridement. On removal of the pessary, a gush of urine was noted followed by confirmation of a large vesico-vaginal fistula (VVF). In the initial period of follow-up, she was reviewed by the urogynaecology team and considered to be a poor surgical candidate for a major surgical procedure and was offered conservative measures with incontinence pads and possible indwelling catheter. Serious complications like fistulae can still occur despite well-managed pessary treatment.

This study explores the early impact of COVID-19 lockdown on selected crimes in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Based on open data of the total number of arrests reported by Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP), an uninterrupted historical time series analysis is applied to evaluate the immediate impact during and after the official stay-at-home order due to COVID-19. Auto-regressive moving average (ARIMA) modeling technique was used to compute 6-month-ahead forecasts of the expected frequency of the total number of arrests for illegal arms dealing, vehicle theft, and narcotics trafficking in the absence of the pandemic. These forecasts were compared with the observed data from April 2020 to September 2020. The results suggest that the observed numbers of total arrests for vehicle thefts and illegal arms dealing are not significantly different from their predicted values. However, the observed frequency of the total number of arrests for illegal drug trafficking shows a steep upward trend, which is 75% more than that of the expected frequencies. Estimated results are used to recognize scopes and suggestions for future research on the relationship between crimes and the pandemic.","Rashid, Sungida",Asian J Criminol,,470

349231,"Sexuality, sexual well being, and intimacy during COVID-19 pandemic: An advocacy perspective",2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the seventh member of the bat severe acute respiratory syndrome family. COVID-19 can fuse their envelopes with the host cell membranes and deliver their genetic material. COVID-19 attacks the respiratory system and stimulates the host inflammatory responses, enhances the recruitment of immune cells, and promotes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activities. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 may have experienced fever, dry cough, headache, dyspnea, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute heart injury. Several strategies such as oxygen therapy, ventilation, antibiotic or antiviral therapy, and renal replacement therapy are commonly used to decrease COVID-19-associated mortality. However, these approaches may not be good treatment options. Therefore, the search for an alternative-novel therapy is urgently important to prevent the disease progression. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a promising strategy for COVID-19. The design of oligonucleotide against the genetic material of COVID-19 might suppress virus RNA translation. Several previous studies have shown that host miRNAs play an antiviral role and improve the treatment of patients with COVID-19. miRNAs by binding to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) or 5'-UTR of viral RNA play an important role in COVID-19-host interplay and viral replication. miRNAs interact with multiple pathways and reduce inflammatory biomarkers, thrombi formation, and tissue damage to accelerate the patient outcome. The information in this review provides a summary of the current clinical application of miRNAs for the treatments of patients with COVID-19.","Ying, Hao; Ebrahimi, Mohsen; Keivan, Mona; Khoshnam, Seyed Esmaeil; Salahi, Sarvenaz; Farzaneh, Maryam",Cell biol. int,,470

Vaccination campaign is one of the most successful public health interventions and a cornerstone for the prevention of communicable infectious diseases. To have a baseline data and to form the basis for further vaccination drive, we carried out this study with an objective to understand the perception and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among health care workers (HCWs). Methods: A correctional study was carried out at one of the multispecialty hospital in North India where COVID-19 vaccination for HCWs was planned and 675 HCWs were taken into the study. Data were collected by means of personal interview using pretested semi-structured questionnaire and Epi Info version 6 was used for analysis. Results: The mean age of the participants was 32.78 years. Majority were male (89.48%), working in government sector (87.7%) and paramedic (88.15%). While 94.67% were accepting vaccine voluntarily while remaining were not confident enough on their own, only 26.96% were ready to take vaccine even on payment. The overall awareness scores of study participants were calculated and found that 79.56% of them had poor awareness level while only 20.44% had satisfactory awareness level. The association of awareness score was statistically significant with job profile (designation), gender, and prior COVID-19 positivity of study participants. Conclusion: The decision of vaccine prioritization to HCWs and frontline workers will boost the morale and spirit of warriors high in future. This study was a preliminary attempt to check any vaccine hesitancy factors among HCWs and act accordingly. Although almost all had volunteered for vaccine, the knowledge about vaccine was poor in majority of HCWs as the time period was recent to vaccine rollout and detailed research findings were not yet out about vaccine. All measures to be taken including intensive information education and communications activities targeting HCWs and general population on regular basis to upgrade the knowledge on vaccine issues. A strong communicating policy in an era of misinformation is highly recommended as social media plays an important role in spreading true as well as false messages jeopardizing the entire gains of successful vaccination and attainment of herd immunity.

In addition to its cost-effectiveness in a resources-limited setting, lung ultrasound (LUS) has emerged as a rapid noninvasive imaging tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infected patients. Concerns surrounding LUS include the disparity of infected patients and healthcare providers, relatively small number of physicians and sonographers capable of performing LUS, and most importantly, the requirement for substantial physical contact between the patient and operator, increasing the risk of transmission. Mitigation of the spread of the virus is of paramount importance. A 2-dimensional (2D) tele-operative robotic platform capable of performing LUS in for COVID-19 infected patients may be of significant benefit. The authors address the aforementioned issues surrounding the use of LUS in the application of COVID- 19 infected patients. In addition, first time application, feasibility and safety were validated in three healthy subjects, along with 2D image optimization and comparison for overall accuracy. Preliminary results demonstrate that the proposed platform allows for successful acquisition and application of LUS in humans.","Tsumura, Ryosuke; Hardin, John W.; Bimbraw, Keshav; Odusanya, Olushola S.; Zheng, Yihao; Hill, Jeffrey C.; Hoffmann, Beatrice; Soboyejo, Winston; Zhang, Haichong K.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12335v3.pdf,470

352648,Determinants of physical activity maintenance during the Covid-19 pandemic: a focus on fitness apps,2020,"Transcription occurs across more than 70% of the human genome and more than half of currently annotated genes produce functional noncoding RNAs. Of these transcripts, the majority-long, noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)-are greater than 200 nucleotides in length and are necessary for various roles in the cell. It is increasingly appreciated that these lncRNAs are relevant in both health and disease states, with the brain expressing the largest number of lncRNAs compared to other organs. Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive, fatal brain tumor that demonstrates remarkable intratumoral heterogeneity, which has made the development of effective therapies challenging. The cooperation between genetic and epigenetic alterations drives rapid adaptation that allows therapeutic evasion and recurrence. Given the large repertoire of lncRNAs in normal brain tissue and the well-described roles of lncRNAs in molecular and cellular processes, these transcripts are important to consider in the context of GBM heterogeneity and treatment resistance. Herein, we review the general mechanisms and biological roles of lncRNAs, with a focus on GBM, as well as RNA-based therapeutics currently in development.","DeSouza, Patrick A; Qu, Xuan; Chen, Hao; Patel, Bhuvic; Maher, Christopher A; Kim, Albert H",,,470
354088,Health and Psychosocial Needs of Saudi Children During COVID-19 Outbreak,2020,"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, third-year medical students were temporarily unable to participate in onsite clinical activities. We identified the curricular components of an internal medicine (IM) clerkship that would be compromised if students learned solely from online didactics, case studies, and simulations (i.e., prerounding, oral presentations, diagnostic reasoning, and medical management discussions). Using these guiding principles, we created a virtual rounds (VR) curriculum to provide IM clerkship students with clinical exposure during a virtual learning period. Methods: Held three times a week for 2 weeks, VR consisted of three curricular components. First, clerkship students prerounded on an assigned hospitalized patient by remotely accessing the electronic health record and calling into hospital rounds. Second, each student prepared an oral presentation on their assigned patient. Third, using videoconferencing, students delivered these oral presentations to telemedicine VR small groups consisting of three to four students and three tele-instructors. Tele-instructors then provided feedback on oral presentations and taught clinical concepts. We assessed the effectiveness of VR by anonymously surveying students and tele-instructors. Results: Twenty-nine students and 34 volunteer tele-instructors participated in VR over four blocks. A majority of students felt VR improved their prerounding abilities (86%), oral presentation abilities (93%), and clinical reasoning skills (62%). All students found small group to be useful. Discussion: VR allowed students to practice rounding skills in a supportive team-based setting. The lessons learned from its implementation could facilitate education during future pandemics and could also supplement in-person clerkship education.","Sukumar, Smrithi; Zakaria, Adam; Lai, Cindy J; Sakumoto, Matthew; Khanna, Raman; Choi, Nancy",MedEdPORTAL,,470

The capacities for artificial ventilation in intensive care units were too scarce to care for patients with acute respiratory disorder connected to the disease. Several professional associations published COVID-19 triage recommendations in an extremely short time: in 21 days between March 6 and March 27. In this article, we compare recommendations from five European countries, which combine medical and ethical reflections on this situation in some detail. Our aim is to provide a detailed overview on the ethical elements of the recommendations, the differences between them and their coherence. In more general terms we want to identify shortcomings in regard to a common European response to the current situation.","Ehni, Hans-Jörg; Wiesing, Urban; Ranisch, Robert",Bioethics,,470

However in the USA, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been politically polarized. The objective of this study is to investigate the association between political partisanship and COVID-19 deaths rates in the USA. METHODS: This study used longitudinal county-level panel data, segmented into 10 30-day time periods, consisting of all counties in the USA, from 22 January 2020 to 5 December 2020. The outcome measure is the total number of COVID-19 deaths per 30-day period. The key explanatory variable is county political partisanship, dichotomized as Democratic or Republican. The analysis used a ZINB regression. RESULTS: When compared with Republican counties, COVID-19 death rates in Democratic counties were significantly higher (IRRs ranged from 2.0 to 18.3, P < 0.001) in Time 1-Time 5, but in Time 9-Time10, were significantly lower (IRRs ranged from 0.43 to 0.69, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The reversed trend in COVID-19 death rates between Democratic and Republican counties was influenced by the political polarized response to the pandemic. The findings support the necessity of evidence-based public health leadership and management in maneuvering the USA out of the current COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future public health crises.","Chen, Hsueh-Fen; Karim, Saleema A",J. public health (Oxf),,470

During this time, final-year medical students at King's College London, England, have received some of their general practice teachings in the form of virtual tutor groups. The predominant feature of such groups is online patient simulations, which provide students a valuable experience to help gain insight into current clinical practice amid the pandemic and inform how their practices as incoming junior doctors would continue. Even in the absence of face-to-face teaching and clinical placements, students have been able to hone their medical knowledge and soft skills through these virtual, simulated consultations. They have been exposed to a new consultation style while in a safe and collaborative learning space. Here, we explore how medical students have benefited from these virtual tutor groups and how similar small-group online teaching opportunities can add value to the medical curriculum in the future.","Paul, Nadine; Kohara, Sae; Khera, Gursharan Kaur; Gunawardena, Ramith",JMIR Med Educ,,470

356219,Impact of outbreak COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatry emergencies in Spain,2020,"AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. It can lead to multiorgan failure, including respiratory and cardiovascular decompensation, and kidney injury, with significant associated morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with underlying metabolic, cardiovascular, respiratory or kidney disease. Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, has shown significant cardio- and renoprotective benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes (with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and may provide similar organ protection in high-risk patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DARE-19 (NCT04350593) is an investigator-initiated, collaborative, international, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study testing the dual hypotheses that dapagliflozin can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular, kidney and/or respiratory complications or all-cause mortality, or improve clinical recovery, in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 but not critically ill on admission. Eligible patients will have &#8805;1 cardiometabolic risk factor for COVID-19 complications. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. Primary efficacy endpoints are time to development of new or worsened organ dysfunction during index hospitalization, or all-cause mortality, and the hierarchical composite endpoint of change in clinical status through day 30 of treatment. Safety of dapagliflozin in individuals with COVID-19 will be assessed. CONCLUSIONS: DARE-19 will evaluate whether dapagliflozin can prevent COVID-19-related complications and all-cause mortality, or improve clinical recovery, and assess the safety profile of dapagliflozin in this patient population. Currently, DARE-19 is the first large randomized controlled trial investigating use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in patients with COVID-19.","Kosiborod, Mikhail; Berwanger, Otavio; Koch, Gary G; Martinez, Felipe; Mukhtar, Omar; Verma, Subodh; Chopra, Vijay; Javaheri, Ali; Ambery, Philip; Gasparyan, Samvel B; Buenconsejo, Joan; Sjöström, C David; Langkilde, Anna Maria; Oscarsson, Jan; Esterline, Russell",Diabetes Obes Metab,,470

We evaluated risk factors and outcomes of AKI in hospitalized older adults with and without COVID-19. METHODS: Observational study of patients admitted to two geriatric clinics in Stockholm from March 1st to June 15th, 2020. The difference in incidence, risk factors and adverse outcomes for AKI between patients with or without COVID-19 were examined. Odds ratios (OR) for the risk of AKI and in-hospital death were obtained from logistic regression. RESULTS: Three hundred-sixteen older patients were hospitalized for COVID-19 and 876 patients for non-COVID-19 diagnoses. AKI occurred in 92 (29%) patients with COVID-19 vs. 159 (18%) without COVID-19. The odds for developing AKI were higher in patients with COVID-19 (adjusted OR, 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-2.76), low baseline kidney function as depicted by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [4.19 (2.48-7.05), for eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min, and 20.3 (9.95-41.3) for eGFR < 30 mL/min], and higher C reactive protein (CRP) (OR 1.81 (1.11-2.95) in patients with initial CRP > 10 mg/L). Compared to patients without COVID-19 and without AKI, the risk of in-hospital death was highest in patients with COVID-19 and AKI [OR 80.3, 95% CI (27.3-235.6)], followed by COVID-19 without AKI [16.3 (6.28-42.4)], and by patients without COVID-19 and with AKI [10.2 (3.66-28.2)]. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had a higher incidence of AKI compared to patients hospitalized for other diagnoses. COVID-19 and reduced baseline kidney function were risk factors for developing AKI.

I argue that loneliness is a relevant issue for bioethicists for three main reasons: it causes ill-health; particularly in the age of Covid-19, it is becoming prominent on the clinical and public health agenda, affecting millions worldwide; and it engenders several ethical and philosophical questions as a social determinant of health with a rich conceptual background. In what follows I first review the link between loneliness and ill-health and argue that it should concern bioethicists because of this link. I also demonstrate how pertinent the issue of loneliness is being considered nowadays, and mark this as another reason for bioethicists to become engaged. I then move on to define loneliness and its various forms, drawing from modern and contemporary philosophers. The way we choose to cope with the pandemic of loneliness depends in part on its theoretical underpinnings, as well as its empirical scope. Theory thus combines with empirical data in order to devise and implement a rational public health policy, necessitating the kind of interdisciplinary approach that is the bedrock of bioethics. I conclude by suggesting future areas of research and recommendations.","Lederman, Zohar",Bioethics,,470

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data retrospectively of 180 cases of COVID-19, from 15 January 2020 to 31 March 2020, from both the Wuhan Zhongnan and Beijing Ditan Hospitals, including 103 cases of mild and 77 cases of severe pneumonia. All patients had their first chest computed tomography scan within five days of symptom onset. The dandelion sign was defined by a focal ground glass opacity (GGO) with a central thickening of the airway wall, and the focal crazy paving sign was defined by a focal GGO with thickening of the interlobular septa. RESULTS: Consolidation presented in only 4.9% (5/103) of the mild pneumonia cases, which was significantly lower than that in severe pneumonia cases (70.1% 54/77), p < .001). Multifocal distribution and pure GGOs were observed more frequently in severe cases of pneumonia (p < .05). The dandelion sign was present in 86.4% (89/103) of the mild pneumonia cases, significantly more frequent than those with severe pneumonia (13.0% [10/77], p < .001). The focal crazy paving sign presented in 65.0% (67/103) of the mild pneumonia cases and was significantly more frequent than in severe cases (23.4% [18/77], p < .001). The hospital stay duration of the mild pneumonia group (13.6 ± 7.2 days) was significantly shorter than the severe pneumonia group (26.6 ± 11.7 days, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Consolidation, pure GGO and multifocal distribution on a CT scan were associated with severe COVID-19.

This new epidemic caused a great mental reaction among the public. This study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression among the public affected by quarantine and those unaffected during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data were collected using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and the self-rating depression scale (SDS) administered to 1593 respondents aged 18 years and above. The respondents were grouped as 'affected group' and 'unaffected group' on the basis of whether they or their families/colleagues/classmates/neighbors had been quarantined. RESULTS Among 1593 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was approximately 8.3% and 14.6%, respectively, and the prevalence in the affected group (12.9%, 22.4%) was significantly higher than that in the unaffected group (6.7%, 11.9%). Lower average household income, lower education level, having a higher self-evaluated level of knowledge, being more worried about being infected, having no psychological support, greater property damage, and lower self-perceived health condition were significant associated with higher scores on the SAS and SDS. People living in Chongqing had higher SAS and SDS scores than those living in Yunnan Province. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of anxiety and depression of the affected group are higher than in the unaffected group during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020.

RESULTS: The generalized linear models show that the following factors influence the cumulative number of confirmed cases in China: the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism; locking down the worst-hit areas; the highest level response to public health emergencies; the expansion of medical insurance coverage to suspected patients; makeshift hospitals; residential closed management; counterpart assistance. The following factors influence the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Germany: the Novel Coronavirus Crisis Command; large gathering cancelled; real-time COVID-19 risk assessment; the medical emergency plan; schools closure; restrictions on the import of overseas epidemics; the no-contact protocol. CONCLUSIONS: There are two differences between China and Germany in non-pharmaceutical interventions: China adopted the blocking strategy, and Germany adopted the first mitigation and then blocking strategy; China's goal is to eliminate the virus, and Germany's goal is to protect high-risk groups to reduce losses. At the same time, the policies implemented by the two countries have similarities: strict blockade is a key measure to control the source of infection, and improving medical response capabilities is an important way to reduce mortality.","Zhang, Yuyao; Shi, Leiyu; Chen, Haiqian; Wang, Xiaohan; Sun, Gang",Int J Equity Health,,470

362373,Antimicrobial stewardship in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: a population-based cohort study and interrupted time-series analysis,2021,"Importance: There is an unmet need for effective treatments for suicidality in mental disorders. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) has been investigated as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy, a known effective treatment for suicidality, in the management of treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, with promising findings. Yet, there are very limited data on the association of MST with suicidality directly. It is important to explore the potential of MST as a viable treatment alternative to electroconvulsive therapy for suicidality. Objective: To determine the association of MST with suicidality in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nonrandomized controlled trial took place at a single tertiary care psychiatric facility in Canada. It followed an open-label study design with consecutive treatment cohorts. Consecutive groupings of 67 patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder and with baseline suicidality present were treated for up to 24 treatments. The study was run from February 2012 through June 2019. Patients were followed up for 6 months at the end of the treatment period. This post hoc secondary analysis of the trial was performed from January to November 2019. Interventions: MST was delivered at 100% stimulator output over the prefrontal cortex with low (25 Hz), moderate (50 or 60 Hz), or high (100 Hz) frequency, for a maximum of 24 sessions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Remission from suicidality was measured as an end point score of 0 on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation. A linear mixed model was used to assess the trajectory of Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation scores. Results: A total of 67 patients (mean [SD] age, 46.3 [13.6] years; 40 women [60.0%]) received a mean (SD) of 19.5 (5.1) MST treatments. The overall number of patients achieving remission was 32 (47.8%). Sixteen patients (55.2%) receiving low-frequency MST achieved remission, as well as 12 patients (54.5%) in the moderate-frequency group, and 4 patients (25.0%) in the high-frequency group. The linear mixed model revealed an association of time with Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation scores (F8,293.95 = 5.73; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that MST may be an effective treatment for suicidality, and sensitivity analysis shows this may be particularly so at low and moderate frequencies. Future studies should directly compare MST with electroconvulsive therapy for treating suicidality and should evaluate MST as a treatment for suicidality across mental disorders.

362918,Multifractal scaling analyses of the spatial diffusion pattern of COVID-19 pandemic in Chinese mainland,2020-10-05,"BACKGROUND: In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cancer are regarded as a highly vulnerable population. Overall, those requiring hospital admission for treatment administration are potentially exposed to a higher risk of infection and worse outcome given the multiple in-hospital exposures and the treatment immunosuppressive effects. METHODS: COVINT is an observational study assessing COVID-19 incidence among patients receiving anticancer treatment in the outpatient clinic of the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori di Milano. All consecutive patients with non-haematological malignancies treated with intravenous or subcutaneous/intramuscular anticancer therapy in the outpatient clinic were enrolled. The primary endpoint is the rate of occurrence of COVID-19. Secondary endpoints included the rate of COVID-19-related deaths and treatment interruptions. The association between clinical and biological characteristics and COVID-19 occurrence is also evaluated. COVID-19 diagnosis is defined as (1) certain if confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR assay of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS); (2) suspected in case of new symptoms or CT scan evidence of interstitial pneumonia with negative/not performed NPS; (3) negative in case of neither symptoms nor radiological evidence. RESULTS: In the first 2 months (16 February-10 April 2020) of observation, 1081 patients were included. Of these, 11 (1%) were confirmed and 73 (6.7%) suspected for COVID-19. No significant differences in terms of cancer and treatment type emerged between the three subgroups. Prophylactic use of myeloid growth factors was adopted in 5.3%, 2.7% and 0% of COVID-19-free, COVID-19-suspected and COVID-19-confirmed patients (p=0.003). Overall, 96 (8.9%) patients delayed treatment as a precaution for the pandemic. Among the 11 confirmed cases, 6 (55%) died of COVID-19 complications, and anticancer treatment was restarted in only one. CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic peak, accurate protective measures successfully resulted in low rates of COVID-19 diagnosis, although with high lethality. Prospective patients' surveillance will continue with NPS and serology testing to provide a more comprehensive epidemiological picture, a biological insight on the impact of cytotoxic treatments on the immune response, and to protect patients and healthcare workers.","Nichetti, Federico; Bini, Marta; Ambrosini, Margherita; Ottini, Arianna; Rametta, Alessandro; Leporati, Rita; Polastri, Daniela; Pircher, Chiara; Dotti, Katia; Ferrari, Laura; de Braud, Filippo",,,470

The worldwide pandemic of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in Wuhan province of China, in December 2019, and spread rapidly throughout the world. More than 6 million cases and 370,000 deaths had been reported by 31 May 2020 in more than 200 countries. No data are available from any clinical trials supporting a proposed prophylactic therapy. More than 300 active clinical trials are currently underway. Many drugs have been studied against COVID-19, but there is no actual evidence from any randomized clinical trials with a potential therapy that can improve outcomes of a patient diagnosed with COVID-19. In some cases, many of the investigated drugs cause side effects, e.g. chloroquine, ribavirin. Besides its beneficial effects such as reducing disease progression and decreasing symptom duration, chloroquine can cause cardiac side effects. Ribavirin, on the other hand, is recognized as a teratogen and considered unsafe in pregnancy. No special effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19 is currently available. Although the course of the disease is mild and moderate in the majority of the COVID-19 patients, more than 5%-7% of the patients' life being under severely susceptible threats requires more effective medicinal products, urgently.","Yunusoğlu, Oruç; Ali, Hoshyar Saadi",East.

The constant news coverage, rapid transmission, and relatively high mortality rate, make fearfulness a natural response. To assess the fear of COVID-19, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) was developed. The primary aim of the present study was to conduct the first psychometric assessment and validation of the English version of the FCV-19S. Two samples were collected in New Zealand. Sample 1 comprised 1624 participants of which 1397 completed all questions and were used in the analyses. Sample 2 comprised 1111 participants of which 1023 completed all questions and were used in the analyses. Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain the scale's reliability and validity. Across both samples, the FCV-19S had high internal consistency. Consistent with the earlier validation studies, the FCV-19S displayed a moderately strong relationship with the perceived infectability and germ aversion subscales of the perceived vulnerability to disease scale (PVDS). Furthermore, FCV-19S scores were negatively correlated with the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) scores. With respect to the motivating role of fear, there was a significant relationship between FCV-19S scores and adherence to the lockdown rules that were implemented in New Zealand. Finally, consistent with recent reports on the politicization of the COVID-19 pandemic, an exploratory question found that participants who rated themselves as more conservative tended to report lower FCV-19S scores. The English version of the COVID-19S is a sound unidimensional scale with robust psychometric properties and can be used with confidence among English-speaking populations.","Winter, Taylor; Riordan, Benjamin C; Pakpour, Amir H; Griffiths, Mark D; Mason, Andre; Poulgrain, John W; Scarf, Damian",Int J Ment Health Addict,,470

Additionally, when the number of deaths data is also provided with the number of total cases to the input of LSTM Network, the mean error reduces to 0.99 +/- 0.51%. Consequently, addition of the number of deaths data to the input, results a lower error in forecasting, compared to using only the number of total cases as the input. However, Holt-Winters Additive method with Damped Trend gives superior results to LSTM Networks in forecasting the total number of COVID-19 cases.","Helli, S.

Understanding the patient-specific and cancer-specific features that impact the severity of COVID-19 may inform optimal cancer care during this pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined consecutive patients with lung cancer and confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (n = 102) at a single center from 12 March 2020 to 6 May 2020. Thresholds of severity were defined a priori as hospitalization, intensive care unit/intubation/do not intubate ([ICU/intubation/DNI] a composite metric of severe disease), or death. Recovery was defined as >14 days from COVID-19 test and >3 days since symptom resolution. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles were inferred from MSK-IMPACT (n = 46) and compared with controls with lung cancer and no known non-COVID-19 (n = 5166). RESULTS: COVID-19 was severe in patients with lung cancer (62% hospitalized, 25% died). Although severe, COVID-19 accounted for a minority of overall lung cancer deaths during the pandemic (11% overall). Determinants of COVID-19 severity were largely patient-specific features, including smoking status and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [odds ratio for severe COVID-19 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.07-9.44 comparing the median (23.5 pack-years) to never-smoker and 3.87, 95% confidence interval 1.35-9.68, respectively]. Cancer-specific features, including prior thoracic surgery/radiation and recent systemic therapies did not impact severity. Human leukocyte antigen supertypes were generally similar in mild or severe cases of COVID-19 compared with non-COVID-19 controls. Most patients recovered from COVID-19, including 25% patients initially requiring intubation. Among hospitalized patients, hydroxychloroquine did not improve COVID-19 outcomes. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with high burden of severity in patients with lung cancer. Patient-specific features, rather than cancer-specific features or treatments, are the greatest determinants of severity.","Luo, J; Rizvi, H; Preeshagul, I R; Egger, J V; Hoyos, D; Bandlamudi, C; McCarthy, C G; Falcon, C J; Schoenfeld, A J; Arbour, K C; Chaft, J E; Daly, R M; Drilon, A; Eng, J; Iqbal, A; Lai, W V; Li, B T; Lito, P; Namakydoust, A; Ng, K; Offin, M; Paik, P K; Riely, G J; Rudin, C M; Yu, H A; Zauderer, M G; Donoghue, M T A; Luksza, M; Greenbaum, B D; Kris, M G; Hellmann, M D",Ann Oncol,,470

Here, we evaluated the influence of aging metrics PhenoAge and PhenoAgeAccel to predict adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, we sought to model adaptive metabolic and inflammatory responses to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection using individual PhenoAge components. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed cases admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City. PhenoAge and PhenoAgeAccel were estimated using laboratory values at admission. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to estimate risk for COVID-19 lethality and adverse outcomes (ICU admission, intubation, or death). To explore reproducible patterns which model adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used k-means clustering using PhenoAge components. RESULTS: We included 1068 subjects of whom 222 presented critical illness and 218 died. PhenoAge was a better predictor of adverse outcomes and lethality compared to CA and SpO2 and its predictive capacity was sustained for all age groups. Patients with responses associated to PhenoAgeAccel>0 had higher risk of death and critical illness compared to those with lower values (log-rank p<0.001). Using unsupervised clustering we identified four adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection: 1) Inflammaging associated with CA, 2) metabolic dysfunction associated with cardio-metabolic comorbidities, 3) unfavorable hematological response, and 4) response associated with favorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive responses related to accelerated aging metrics are linked to adverse COVID-19 outcomes and have unique and distinguishable features.

Little is known about the impact of COVID19 on pharmacy services across the United Kingdom (UK). We surveyed community pharmacists across the UK to understand their protective practices, professional and general well-being, and the delivery of pharmacy services during the COVID19 pandemic. Methods: Community pharmacists were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey via the nationwide weekly newsletter of Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee and the local pharmaceutical committees during the second week of May 2020. The survey remained open for 4 weeks. Results: A total of 206 pharmacists responded to the survey with representations from England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. The majority of pharmacists (&gt;75% or above) reported an increase in customer traffic to their pharmacy and were asking relevant questions from patients with flu-like symptoms before signposting them to the appropriate care. Most pharmacists (&gt;85%) were maintaining a safe distance of 2 m from customers and 72% were wearing an N95 protective mask and 28% were using protective gloves and apron in addition to safe distancing and protective masks. Ninety-nine percent of pharmacists reported drug shortages with 38% and 26% reported significant drug shortages and critical drug shortages causing disruptions beyond over the counter medicines. Eighty-nine percent pharmacists reported inappropriate behaviour from patients or carers with 31% and 16% reported it to be a regular or frequent problem, respectively. Fifty-three% of pharmacists were willing to offer their assistance for mass testing of COVID19 antibodies if adequate training and reimbursement are provided. Conclusion: Community pharmacists in the UK are facing considerable challenges in terms of personal protection and the delivery of pharmacy services. Inappropriate behaviour from patients and carers towards community pharmacists require urgent attention to ensure a safe working place for all community pharmacists.","Zaidi, Syed Tabish R.; Hasan, Syed Shahzad",Res.

With the explosive spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the establishment of a BSL-2 adapted SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay is needed to facilitate the development of countermeasures. Here we describe an approach to generate a single-round lentiviral vector-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, which produced a signal more than 2 logs above background. Specifically, a SARS-CoV-2 spike variant with a cytoplasmic tail deletion of 13 amino acids, termed S&#916;CT13, conferred enhanced spike incorporation into pseudovirions and increased viral entry into cells as compared with full-length spike (S). We further compared S and S&#916;CT13 in terms of their sensitivity to vaccine sera, purified convalescent IgG, hACE2-mIgG, and the virus entry inhibitor BafA1. We developed a S&#916;CT13-based pseudovirus neutralization assay and defined key assay characteristics, including linearity, limit of detection, and intra- and intermediate-assay precision. Our data demonstrate that the S&#916;CT13-based pseudovirus shows enhanced infectivity in target cells, which will facilitate the assessment of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, antibody therapeutics, and vaccination. This pseudovirus neutralization assay can also be readily adapted to SARS-CoV-2 variants that emerge.IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 is the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The development of a high throughput pseudovirus neutralization assay is critical for the development of vaccines and immune-based therapeutics. In this study, we show that deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of the SARS-CoV-2 spike leads to pseudoviruses with enhanced infectivity. This S&#916;CT13-based pseudovirus neutralization assay should be broadly useful for the field.","Yu, Jingyou; Li, Zhenfeng; He, Xuan; Gebre, Makda S; Bondzie, Esther A; Wan, Huahua; Jacob-Dolan, Catherine; Martinez, David R; Nkolola, Joseph P; Baric, Ralph S; Barouch, Dan H",J. virol,,470

Several studies of severe COVID-19 patients regard convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion as an effective therapy. However, there are no significant improvements in the randomized clinical trial of CP treatment. Until now, the data of mild COVID-19 patients transfused CP were lack. This study recruited 8 mild COVID-19 patients received at least one dose of CP transfusion. After CP therapy, all patients improved the clinical symptoms. The level of lymphocyte counts tended to increase, meanwhile LDH, CK and AST tended to decrease. However, CRP of 3 patients increased transiently. The median time that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid of the patients turned to negative was 2.5d after CP transfusion. The study shows the potential benefits of CP. Meanwhile, CP probably enhances the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 temporarily in the patients with insufficient antiviral immunity.

371437,Trajectories of Mental Distress Among U.S. Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Transforaminal epidural injections have been used since the late 1990s to treat lumbar radicular pain. They have been the subject of considerable attention, with varying conclusions from systematic reviews as to their efficacy. Transforaminal injections have been associated with rare but major complications. Further, the use of transforaminal injections has increased since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Finally, with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been heightened concern regarding the risk associated with steroid injections. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and update the effectiveness of transforaminal injections for 4 indications: radicular pain; from spinal stenosis; from failed back surgery syndrome; and for axial low back pain; and to evaluate the safety of the procedure. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of transforaminal injections. METHODS: The available literature on transforaminal injections was reviewed and the quality assessed. The level of evidence was classified on a 5-point scale based on the quality of evidence developed by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and modified by the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP). Data sources included relevant literature from 1966 to April 2020, and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles. Pain relief and functional improvement were the primary outcome measures. A minimum of 6 months pain relief follow-up was required. RESULTS: For this systematic review, 66 studies were identified. Eighteen randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. No observational studies were included. Eleven randomized controlled trials dealt with various aspects of transforaminal injections for radicular pain owing to disc herniation. Based on these studies, there is Level 1 evidence supporting the use of transforaminal injections for radicular pain owing to disc herniation. A meta-analysis showed that at both 3 and 6 months, there was highly statistically significant improvement in both pain and function with both particulate and nonparticulate steroids. For radicular pain from central stenosis there is one moderate quality study, with Level IV evidence. For radicular pain caused by failed back surgery syndrome there is one moderate quality study, with Level IV evidence. For radicular pain from foraminal stenosis and for axial pain there is Level V evidence, opinion-based/consensus, supporting the use of transforaminal injections. Transforaminal injections are generally safe. However, they have been associated with major neurologic complications related to cord infarct. Causes other than intraluminal injection of particulates appear to be at play. The use of an infraneural approach and of blunt needles appear to offer the greatest patient safety. Because of concern over the role of particulate steroids, multiple other injectates have been evaluated, including nonparticulate steroids, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) inhibitors, and local anesthetics without steroids. No injectate has been proven superior. If there is concern about immunosuppression because of risk of COVID-19 infection, either the lowest possible dose of steroid or no steroid should be used. LIMITATIONS: The study was limited by the paucity of literature for some indications. CONCLUSIONS: There is Level I evidence for the use of transforaminal injections for radicular pain from disc herniations.","Helm Ii, Standiford; Harmon, Preston C; Noe, Carl; Calodney, Aaron K; Abd-Elsayed, Alaa; Knezevic, Nebojsa Nick; Racz, Gabor B",Pain Physician,,470
371601,"Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: Addictive Social Media Use, Depression, Anxiety and Stress in Quarantine – An exploratory Study in Germany and Lithuania",2021,"Importance: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, eye care professionals caring for patients with sight-threatening diseases, such as glaucoma, have had to determine whether some patient appointments could safely get postponed, weighing the risk that the patient's glaucoma could worsen during the interim vs the morbidity risk of acquiring COVID-19 while seeking ophthalmic care. They also need to prioritize appointment rescheduling during the ramp-up phase (when pandemic-associated service reductions are eased). Objective: To describe a flexible and scalable scoring algorithm for patients with glaucoma that considers glaucoma severity and progression risk vs the presence of high-risk features for morbidity from COVID-19, using information from a large data repository. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, patients with upcoming clinic appointments for glaucoma from March 16, 2020, to April 16, 2020, at an academic institution enrolled in the Sight Outcomes Research Collaborative (SOURCE) Ophthalmology Electronic Health Record Data Repository were identified. A risk stratification tool was developed that calculated a glaucoma severity and progression risk score and a COVID-19 morbidity risk score. These scores were summed to determine a total score for each patient. Main Outcomes and Measures: Total scores and percentages of clinic appointments recommended for rescheduling. Results: Among the 1034 patients with upcoming clinic appointments for glaucoma, the mean (SD) age was 66.7 (14.6) years. There were 575 women (55.6%), 733 White individuals (71%), and 160 Black individuals (15.5%). The mean (SD) glaucoma severity and progression risk score was 4.0 (14.4) points, the mean (SD) COVID-19 morbidity risk score was 27.2 (16.1) points, and the mean (SD) total score was 31.2 (21.4) points. During pandemic-associated reductions in services, using total score thresholds of 0, 25, and 50 points would identify 970 appointments (93.8%), 668 appointments (64.6%), and 275 appointments (26.6%), respectively, for postponement and rescheduling. The algorithm-generated total scores also helped prioritize appointment rescheduling during the ramp-up phase. Conclusions and Relevance: A tool that considers the risk of underlying ophthalmic disease progression from delayed care receipt and the morbidity risk from COVID-19 exposure was developed and implemented, facilitating the triage of upcoming ophthalmic appointments. Comparable approaches for other ophthalmic and nonophthalmic care during the COVID-19 pandemic and similar crises may be created using this methodology.","Bommakanti, Nikhil K; Zhou, Yunshu; Ehrlich, Joshua R; Elam, Angela R; John, Denise; Kamat, Shivani S; Kelstrom, Jared; Newman-Casey, Paula Anne; Shah, Manjool M; Weizer, Jennifer S; Wood, Sarah D; Zhang, Amy D; Zhang, Jason; Lee, Paul P; Stein, Joshua D",JAMA Ophthalmol,,470

Excess production of this compound occurs in COVID-19 resulting in inflammatory cascade and thromboembolism. We intend to propose the use of sildenafil to reduce this production. Method: The analysis of biochemical pathways shows that viral infection produces a high amount of nitric oxide (NO), with an acute inflammatory process. Results: In the case of COVID-19 infection we verified that numerous biochemical processes activate a cascade of inflammatory processes through the activation of iNOS with uncontrolled generation of (NO). Conclusions: iNOS is the cause of damage to host cells with a consequent pulmonary thromboembolic lung phenomenon in a contest of interstitial pneumonia. This study proposes the use of sildenafil to counter the inflammatory cascade and thromboembolic episodes.","Mario, Limodio; Roberto, Menicagli; Marta, Limodio; Teresa, Casotti; Laura, Menicagli",Int.

A critical step of the infection cycle is the binding of the virus spike S protein to the cellular ACE-2 receptor. This interaction involves a receptor binding domain (RBD) located at the center of the S trimer, whereas the lateral N-terminal domain (NTD) displays a flat ganglioside binding site that enables the virus to bind to lipid rafts of the plasma membrane, where the ACE-2 receptor resides. S protein binding to lipid rafts can be blocked by hydroxychloroquine, which binds to gangliosides, and by azithromycin, which binds to the NTD. Based on these data, we identified the NTD of SARS-CoV-2 as a promising target for both therapeutic and vaccine strategies, a notion later supported by the discovery, in convalescent Covid-19 patients, of a neutralizing antibody (4A8) that selectively binds to the NTD. The 4A8 epitope overlaps the ganglioside binding domain, denying any access of the virus to lipid rafts when the antibody is bound to the S protein. Thus, our data explain why antibody binding to the tip of the NTD results in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. The high level of conservation of the ganglioside binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 (100% identity in 584 of 600 isolates analyzed worldwide) offers unique opportunities for innovative vaccine/therapeutic strategies.","Fantini, Jacques; Chahinian, Henri; Yahi, Nouara",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,,470

However, no studies to date have considered the impact of interactions between meteorological factors and air pollutants on COVID-19 transmission. This study explores the association between ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3), meteorological factors (average temperature, diurnal temperature range, relative humidity, wind velocity, air pressure, precipitation, and hours of sunshine), and their interaction on confirmed case counts of COVID-19 in 120 Chinese cities. We modeled total confirmed cases of COVID-19 as the dependent variable with meteorological factors, air pollutants, and their interactions as the independent variables. To account for potential migration effects, we included the migration scale index (MSI) from Wuhan to each of the 120 cities included in the model, using data from 15 Jan. to 18 Mar. 2020. As an important confounding factor, MSI was considered in a negative binomial regression analysis. Positive associations were found between the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and CO, PM2.5, relative humidity, and O3, with and without MSI-adjustment. Negative associations were also found for SO2 and wind velocity both with and without controlling for population migration. In addition, air pollutants and meteorological factors had interactive effects on COVID-19 after controlling for MSI. In conclusion, air pollutants, meteorological factors, and their interactions all affect COVID-19 cases.","Zhou, Jianli; Qin, Linyuan; Meng, Xiaojing; Liu, Nan",,,470

In the context of broad principles, issues including risks of treatment, principles of prioritizing resources, treatment of elderly patients, and psychosocial impact are discussed. Detailed treatment advice and options are given at a tumor stream level. We must maintain care for patients with cancer as best we can and recognize that COVID-19 poses a significant competing risk for death that changes conventional treatment paradigms.","Segelov, Eva; Underhill, Craig; Prenen, Hans; Karapetis, Christos; Jackson, Christopher; Nott, Louise; Clay, Tim; Pavlakis, Nick; Sabesan, Sabe; Heywood, Ellen; Steer, Christopher; Lethborg, Carrie; Gan, Hui K; Yip, Desmond; Karanth, Narayan; Karikios, Deme; MacIntyre, C Raina",JCO Oncol Pract,,470

375802,Psychosomatic Medicine and Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: This study proposes a digital program for the treatment of mental illness that could increase motivation and improve learning outcomes for patients. Several studies have already applied this method by using an exposure and response prevention-inspired serious game to treat patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a mobile cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program would be as effective in treating OCD as traditional offline CBT. In addition, the treatment efficacy in response to mobile CBT for OCD might be associated with increased brain activity within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) tract. METHODS: The digital CBT treatment program for OCD, OCfree, consists of 6 education sessions, 10 quests, and 7 casual games. Information was gathered from 27 patients with OCD (15 offline CBT and 12 OCfree CBT). During the 6-week intervention period, changes in clinical symptoms and brain function activity were analyzed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the change in OCD symptoms and depressive symptoms between the two groups. However, the OCfree group showed greater improvement in anxiety symptoms compared to the offline CBT group. Both offline CBT and OCfree CBT increased the functional connectivity within the CSTC tract in all patients with OCD. However, CBT using OCfree showed greater changes in brain connectivity within the thalamus and insula, compared to offline CBT. CONCLUSIONS: OCfree, an OCD treatment app program, was effective in the treatment of drug-naïve patients with OCD. The treatment effects of OCfree are associated with increased brain connectivity within the CSTC tract. Multisensory stimulation by education, quests, and games in OCfree increases the activity within the thalamus and insula in patients with OCD.","Hwang, Hyunchan; Bae, Sujin; Hong, Ji Sun; Han, Doug Hyun",JMIR Ment Health,,470

MiR-1225 has been reported to play roles in the progression of various cancers, but its role in breast cancer was unclear. The expression of miR-1225 was investigated in breast cancer tissues and cells by quantitative real-time PCR. The role of miR-1225 in the cell process of OS was analyzed by CCK-8 assay and Transwell assay. The prognostic value of miR-1225 was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression analysis. miR-1225 was significantly upregulated in breast cancer tissues, which was associated with the TNM stage of breast cancer patients. The prognosis of patients with high miR-1225 expression was worse than that of patients with low miR-1225 expression, which indicated that miR-1225 acted as an independent factor for the prognosis of breast cancer. Additionally, the upregulation of miR-1225 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer, which suggested miR-1225 might be involved in the progression of breast cancer. JAK1 was identified as the direct target of miR-1225, which was also involved in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer. The overexpression of miR-1225 in breast cancer indicates a poor prognosis of patients and promotes the progression of breast cancer by targeting JAK1. miR-1225 may be a biomarker and therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer.","Gao, Shangfa; Shi, Peng; Tian, Zhishuai; Yang, Xingwang; Liu, Ning",Clin. exp. med,,470

The poor effect of surgery and chemotherapy makes the research of immunotherapy target molecules significant. Therefore, identifying the new molecular targets of PC is important for patients. In our study, we systematically analyzed molecular correlates of pancreatic cancer by bioinformatic analysis. We characterized differentially expressed analysis based on the TCGA pancreatic cancer dataset. Then, univariate Cox regression was employed to screen out overall survival- (OS-) related DEGs. Based on these genes, we established a risk signature by the multivariate Cox regression model. The ICGC cohort and GSE62452 cohort were used to validate the reliability of the risk signature. The impact of T lymphocyte-related genes from risk signature was confirmed in PC. Here, we observed the correlation between the T lymphocyte-related genes and the expression level of targeted therapy. We established a five-mRNA (LY6D, ANLN, ZNF488, MYEOV, and SCN11A) prognostic risk signature. Next, we identified ANLN and MYEOV that were associated with T lymphocyte infiltrations (P < 0.05). High ANLN and MYEOV expression levels had a poorer prognosis in decreased T lymphocyte subgroup in PC. Correlation analysis between ANLN and MYEOV and immunomodulators showed that ANLN and MYEOV may have potential value in pancreatic cancer immunotherapy.","Li, Ziang; Hu, Chang; Yang, Zhiqiang; Yang, Minlan; Fang, Jiayu; Zhou, Xuhong",Comput Math Methods Med,,470

Furthermore, as Ramadan intermittent religious fasting that is practiced by about one and a half billion Muslims throughout the globe is coincide this year with COVID-19 pandemic, a growing debate rose concerning the expected impact of fasting during Ramadan month and the associated dietary and lifestyle behaviors on the body's immunity against the pandemic infection. Published literature was searched to find out how intermittent fasting (IF) and its model of Ramadan affect the various aspects related to the body's immunity against microbial infections. IF was found to impact immunity by changing different related elements, including oxidative stress and inflammation, metabolism, body weight, and body composition. Dietary and lifestyle modifications during Ramadan month and their impact on immunity, such as water intake and hydration status, sleep duration and timing, caloric intake and mealtime, and social and spirtual activities, were addressed. Further research is warranted to figure out how IF during ramadan affects immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Faris, Mo039; ezA-Islam, E; Salem, Mohamed L; Jahrami, Haitham A; Madkour, Mohamed I; BaHammam, Ahmed S",Ann Thorac Med,,470

The results show that compared with UK-born white British, black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) migrants in the UK are more likely to experience job loss during the COVID-19 lockdown, while BAME natives are less likely to enjoy employment protection such as furloughing. Although UK-born white British are more likely to reduce their work hours during the COVID-19 pandemic than BAME migrants, they are less likely to experience income loss and face increased financial hardship during the pandemic than BAME migrants. The findings show that the pandemic exacerbates entrenched socio-economic inequalities along intersecting ethnic and native–migrant lines.

Crowd level data on mobile phone usage can be used as a proxy for actual population mobility patterns and provide a way of quantifying the impact of social distancing measures on changes in mobility. Methods: Here, we use two mobile phone-based datasets (anonymised and aggregated crowd level data from O2 and from the Facebook app on mobile phones) to assess changes in average mobility, both overall and broken down into high and low population density areas, and changes in the distribution of journey lengths. Results: We show that there was a substantial overall reduction in mobility, with the most rapid decline on the 24th March 2020, the day after the Prime Minister's announcement of an enforced lockdown. The reduction in mobility was highly synchronized across the UK. Although mobility has remained low since 26th March 2020, we detect a gradual increase since that time. We also show that the two different datasets produce similar trends, albeit with some location-specific differences. We see slightly larger reductions in average mobility in high-density areas than in low-density areas, with greater variation in mobility in the high-density areas: some high-density areas eliminated almost all mobility. Conclusions: These analyses form a baseline from which to observe changes in behaviour in the UK as social distancing is eased and inform policy towards the future control of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK.

378119,How the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lives: A study of psychological correlates across 59 countries,2020,"In this paper, new results in random matrix theory are derived which allow us to construct a shrinkage estimator of the global minimum variance (GMV) portfolio when the shrinkage target is a random object. More specifically, the shrinkage target is determined as the holding portfolio estimated from previous data. The theoretical findings are applied to develop theory for dynamic estimation of the GMV portfolio, where the new estimator of its weights is shrunk to the holding portfolio at each time of reconstruction. Both cases with and without overlapping samples are considered in the paper. The non-overlapping samples corresponds to the case when different data of the asset returns are used to construct the traditional estimator of the GMV portfolio weights and to determine the target portfolio, while the overlapping case allows intersections between the samples. The theoretical results are derived under weak assumptions imposed on the data-generating process. No specific distribution is assumed for the asset returns except from the assumption of finite $4+\varepsilon$, $\varepsilon>0$, moments. Also, the population covariance matrix with unbounded spectrum can be considered. The performance of new trading strategies is investigated via an extensive simulation. Finally, the theoretical findings are implemented in an empirical illustration based on the returns on stocks included in the S\&P 500 index.","Bodnar, Taras; Parolya, Nestor; Thorsen, Erik",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02131v1.pdf,470

The flexible model setup allows to study the intensity and type of spatial spillover structures over time. Our results show notable spatial spillover mechanisms in the early stages of the virus with international flight linkages as the main transmission channel. In later stages, our model shows a sharp drop in the intensity spatial spillovers due to national travel bans, indicating that travel restrictions led to a reduction of cross-country spillovers.","Krisztin, Tamás; Piribauer, Philipp; Wögerer, Michael",Lett.

We aimed to investigate whether metformin therapy was associated with the incidence of COVID-19 among type 2 DM patients in South Korea. METHODS: The National Health Insurance Service-COVID-19 cohort database, comprising COVID-19 patients from 1 January 2020 to 4 June 2020, was used for this study. Among them, adult patients with type 2 DM were included in this study. Metformin users were defined as those who had been prescribed continuous oral metformin for over a period of &#8805; 90 days, and the control group was defined as all other patients. RESULTS: Overall, 27,493 patients with type 2 DM (7204, metformin user group; 20,289, control group) were included. After propensity score matching, 11,892 patients (5946 patients in each group) were included in the final analysis. In the logistic regression analysis, the odds of metformin users developing COVID-19 was 30% lower than that of the control group [odds ratio (OR): 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61-0.80; P < 0.001]. However, in the multivariate model, metformin use was not associated with hospital mortality when compared with that of the control group (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 0.81-1.95; P = 0.301). CONCLUSIONS: Metformin therapy might have potential benefits for the prevention of COVID-19 among patients with type 2 DM in South Korea. However, it did not affect the hospital mortality of type 2 DM patients diagnosed with COVID-19.","Oh, Tak Kyu; Song, In-Ae",Acta diabetol,,470

However, the frequent use of these preventive measures can lead to skin reactions. Our study aimed to determine the frequency of these reactions in Northern Morocco. In addition, we also looked at the risk factors and the consequences of these injuries on work efficiency and performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous online survey was used to collect data, which was sent to 500 health workers in the study region. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data on IBM SPSS software. RESULTS: In total, 273/500 responded to the questionnaire (55%). For the participants' profession, 41% were doctors, 32% were nursing staff, and 26% held other jobs. The general prevalence rate of adverse reactions for all health workers was (80%), including skin problems: after wearing goggles (58%), after wearing surgical masks and respirators (57%), after handwashing and wearing gloves (45%), after wearing a face shield (23%), and after wearing protective clothing (11%). Bleach immersion was highly significantly associated with hand reaction (OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.77-4.90; P < 0.001). Moreover, we found a statistically significant association between hand cream use more than twice daily and fewer reactions (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 0.98-3.77; P = 0.038). The skin reactions related to goggles use were also significantly associated with use duration (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 0.988-3.12; P = 0.05). Similarly, wearing masks and N95 respirators and their related adverse reactions were significantly associated with use duration (OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.20-0.7; P = 0.02). In addition, adverse reactions of regular use of protective clothing were related to the frequency of its use per shift (OR: 3.5, 95% CI: 1.47-8.54; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our survey-based study showed that the prevalence of these skin reactions in our context should not be neglected. The length of daily wearing time and the frequency of PPE uses were the most implicated factors. More attention must be paid to these reactions for better care of HCWs during these critical times.","Marraha, Farah; Al Faker, Ibtissam; Charif, Faiza; Chahoub, Hanane; Benyamna, Youness; Rahmani, Najlaa; Kabbou, Soukaina; Rkiek, Yasmine; Najdi, Adil; Gallouj, Salim",Ann.

It seemed that in modern society, with its developed system of hygiene, medicine, sanitary and epidemiological measures for the prevention of diseases (prevention, vaccination, etc.), the mass and uncontrolled spread of dangerous infectious diseases that covered not only local areas, but and entire countries, remained only in the memories of the distant past. But! As it turned out, the existing means of control were not enough, and now a new coronavirus with the code name - COVID-19 is rapidly spreading around the world and the spread of which is determined by the WHO pandemic. One of the measures to combat the spread of the virus was the isolation of citizens and, accordingly, a decrease of their activity. But the activity of criminals has not decreased - on the contrary, new circumstances give them the opportunity to more effectively carry out their actions. Therefore, the development of a typical psychological (criminalistic) portrait of a criminal with a conditional name ""quarantine"", seems relevant and promising. Against the backdrop of outbreaks of coronavirus, more and more people do not part with medical masks, respirators. Although the mask provides some protection against infection, it significantly complicates the process of biometric authentication, which complicates the work of even artificial intelligence technologies.","Kaliuga, K.

382472,Psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the Bullying and Cyber Bullying Scale for Adolescents (BCS-A),2020,"The global propagation of SARS-CoV-2 and the detection of a large number of variants, some of which have replaced the original clade to become dominant, underscores the fact that the virus is actively exploring its evolutionary space. The longer high levels of viral multiplication occur - permitted by high levels of transmission -, the more the virus can adapt to the human host and find ways to success. The third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is starting in different parts of the world, emphasizing that transmission containment measures that are being imposed are not adequate. Part of the consideration in determining containment measures is the rationale that vaccination will soon stop transmission and allow a return to normality. However, vaccines themselves represent a selection pressure for evolution of vaccine-resistant variants, so the coupling of a policy of permitting high levels of transmission/virus multiplication during vaccine roll-out with the expectation that vaccines will deal with the pandemic, is unrealistic. In the absence of effective antivirals, it is not improbable that SARS-CoV-2 infection prophylaxis will involve an annual vaccination campaign against 'dominant' viral variants, similar to influenza prophylaxis. Living with COVID-19 will be an issue of SARS-CoV-2 variants and evolution. It is therefore crucial to understand how SARS-CoV-2 evolves and what constrains its evolution, in order to anticipate the variants that will emerge. Thus far, the focus has been on the receptor-binding spike protein, but the virus is complex, encoding 26 proteins which interact with a large number of host factors, so the possibilities for evolution are manifold and not predictable a priori. However, if we are to mount the best defence against COVID-19, we must mount it against the variants, and to do this, we must have knowledge about the evolutionary possibilities of the virus. In addition to the generic cellular interactions of the virus, there are extensive polymorphisms in humans (e.g. Lewis, HLA, etc.), some distributed within most or all populations, some restricted to specific ethnic populations and these variations pose additional opportunities for/constraints on viral evolution. We now have the wherewithal - viral genome sequencing, protein structure determination/modelling, protein interaction analysis - to functionally characterize viral variants, but access to comprehensive genome data is extremely uneven. Yet, to develop an understanding of the impacts of such evolution on transmission and disease, we must link it to transmission (viral epidemiology) and disease data (patient clinical data), and the population granularities of these. In this editorial, we explore key facets of viral biology and the influence of relevant aspects of human polymorphisms, human behaviour, geography and climate and, based on this, derive a series of recommendations to monitor viral evolution and predict the types of variants that are likely to arise.","Luo, Ruibang; Delaunay-Moisan, Agnès; Timmis, Kenneth; Danchin, Antoine",Environ Microbiol,,470

Here, we studied the response of program directors (PDs) and applicants to virtual interviews. Virtual interviews could decrease both financial and time commitments. OBJECTIVE: To determine if most applicants and PDs believed that virtual interviews should be used more widely in the future. DESIGN: After the 2020 cardiothoracic fellowship match, an e-mail survey was sent to 66 program directors and 107 applicants using the Qualtrics platform. SETTING: During the 2020 cardiothoracic fellowship interview cycle, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down travel for in-person interviews. This forced a transition to virtual interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Of 107 applicants emailed, 46 (44%) participated with a completion rate of 87%. sixty-six PDs were contacted and of those, 36 (55%) participated with a 92% survey completion rate. EXPOSURE: All survey participants were participants in the 2020 cardiothoracic match. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): (1) The percent of participants who agree that virtual interviews should be continued in the future and the percent of participants who agree that virtual interviews could be replacements for in person interviews. (2) Were virtual interviews perceived to have a negative impact on one's ultimate match? (3) What is the current cost of an in-person interview in travel and lodging for an applicant? RESULTS: Fourty-six applicants (44% participation rate) and 36 PDs (55% participation rate) participated in the survey. Seventy-nine percent of program directors and 55% of applicants either agreed or strongly agreed that virtual interviews should be offered in the future. However, just 15% of PDs and 20% of applicants either agreed or strongly agreed that virtual interviews should be offered without the option of an in-person interview. Twenty-five percent of PDs and applicants agreed or strongly agreed that virtual interviews negatively impacted their chance of matching one of their top applicants/programs. The median cost of an in-person interview was $600 (interquatile range 500-725). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most applicants and PDs agree that virtual interviews should be offered in the future.

383811,Living Organ Donor Healthcare Priorities during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of infant hospitalizations in the United States. Growing evidence supports the heterogeneity of bronchiolitis. However, little is known about the interrelationships between major respiratory viruses (and their species), host systemic metabolism, and disease pathobiology. METHODS: In an ongoing multicenter prospective cohort study, we profiled the serum metabolome in 113 infants (63 RSV-only, 21 RV-A, and 29 RV-C) hospitalized with bronchiolitis. We identified serum metabolites that are most discriminatory in the RSV-RV-A and RSV-RV-C comparisons using sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis. We then investigated the association between discriminatory metabolites with acute and chronic outcomes. RESULTS: In 113 infants with bronchiolitis, we measured 639 metabolites. Serum metabolomic profiles differed in both comparisons (Ppermutation < 0.05). In the RSV-RV-A comparison, we identified 30 discriminatory metabolites, predominantly in lipid metabolism pathways (eg, sphingolipids and carnitines). In multivariable models, these metabolites were significantly associated with the risk of clinical outcomes (eg, tricosanoyl sphingomyelin, OR for recurrent wheezing at age of 3 years = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.05-2.15). In the RSV-RV-C comparison, the discriminatory metabolites were also primarily involved in lipid metabolism (eg, glycerophosphocholines [GPCs], 12,13-diHome). These metabolites were also significantly associated with the risk of outcomes (eg, 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC, OR for positive pressure ventilation use during hospitalization = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.28-0.78). CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses and their species had distinct serum metabolomic signatures that are associated with differential risks of acute and chronic morbidities of bronchiolitis. Our findings advance research into the complex interrelations between viruses, host systemic response, and bronchiolitis pathobiology.","Fujiogi, Michimasa; Camargo, Carlos A; Raita, Yoshihiko; Bochkov, Yury A; Gern, James E; Mansbach, Jonathan M; Piedra, Pedro A; Hasegawa, Kohei",Pediatr. allergy immunol,,470

Analysis of two Relevant Psychiatry Hospitals",2020,"COVID-19 is a major health threat across the globe, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and it is highly contagious with significant mortality. In this study, we conduct a scenario analysis for COVID-19 in Malaysia using a simple universality class of the SIR system and extensions thereof (i.e., the inclusion of temporary immunity through the reinfection problems and limited medical resources scenarios leads to the SIRS-type model). This system has been employed in order to provide further insights on the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 pandemic. As a case study, the COVID-19 transmission dynamics are investigated using daily confirmed cases in Malaysia, where some of the epidemiological parameters of this system are estimated based on the fitting of the model to real COVID-19 data released by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH). We observe that this model is able to mimic the trend of infection trajectories of COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia and it is possible for transmission dynamics to be influenced by the reinfection force and limited medical resources problems. A rebound effect in transmission could occur after several years and this situation depends on the intensity of reinfection force. Our analysis also depicts the existence of a critical value in reinfection threshold beyond which the infection dynamics persist and the COVID-19 outbreaks are rather hard to eradicate. Therefore, understanding the interplay between distinct epidemiological factors using mathematical modelling approaches could help to support authorities in making informed decisions so as to control the spread of this pandemic effectively.","Salman, Amer M; Ahmed, Issam; Mohd, Mohd Hafiz; Jamiluddin, Mohammad Subhi; Dheyab, Mohammed Ali",Comput Biol Med,,470

385103,Effects of the covid-19 pandemic on neurological diseases,2021,"Detection and isolation of infected people are believed to play an important role in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some countries conduct large-scale screenings for testing, whereas others test mainly people with high prior probability of infection such as showing severe symptoms and/or having an epidemiological link with a known or suspected case or cluster of cases. However, what a good testing strategy is and whether the difference in testing strategy shows a meaningful, measurable impact on the COVID-19 epidemic remain unknown. Here, we showed that patterns of association between effective reproduction number (Rt) and test positivity rate can illuminate differences in testing situation among different areas, using global and local data from Japan. This association can also evaluate the adequacy of current testing systems and what information is captured in COVID-19 surveillance. The differences in testing systems alone cannot predict the results of epidemic containment efforts. Furthermore, monitoring test positivity rates and severe case proportions among the nonelderly can predict imminent case count increases. Monitoring test positivity rates in conjunction with the concurrent Rt could be useful to assess and strengthen public health management and testing systems and deepen understanding of COVID-19 epidemic dynamics.","Furuse, Yuki; Ko, Yura K; Ninomiya, Kota; Suzuki, Motoi; Oshitani, Hitoshi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,470

Data regarding the implications of COVID-19 disease at early gestation on fetal and obstetric outcomes is scarce. Thus, our aim was to investigate the effect of first and second trimester maternal COVID-19 disease on fetal and perinatal outcomes. This was a prospective cohort study of pregnant women with a laboratory-proven SARS-COV-2 infection contracted prior to 26 weeks gestation. Women were followed at a single tertiary medical center by serial sonographic examinations every 4–6 weeks to assess fetal well-being, growth, placental function, anatomic evaluation and signs of fetal infection. Amniocentesis was offered to assess amniotic fluid SARS-COV-2-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was offered at 30–32 weeks gestation. Demographic, obstetric and neonatal data were collected from history intake, medical charts or by telephone survey. Perinatal outcomes were compared between women infected at first vs. second trimester. 55 women with documented COVID-19 disease at early gestation were included and followed at our center. The mean maternal age was 29.6 ± 6.2 years and the mean gestational age at viral infection was 14.2 ± 6.7 weeks with 28 (51%) women infected at the first trimester and 27 (49%) at the second trimester. All patients but one experienced asymptomatic to mild symptoms. Of 22 patients who underwent amniocentesis, none had evidence of vertical transmission. None of the fetuses exhibited signs of central nervous system (CNS) disease, growth restriction and placental dysfunction on serial ultrasound examinations and fetal MRI. Pregnancies resulted in perinatal survival of 100% to date with mean gestational age at delivery of 38.6 ± 3.0 weeks and preterm birth &lt;37 weeks rate of 3.4%. The mean birthweight was 3260 ± 411 g with no cases of small for gestational age infants. The obstetric and neonatal outcomes were similar among first vs. second trimester infection groups. We conclude SARS-CoV-2 infection at early gestation was not associated with vertical transmission and resulted in favorable obstetric and neonatal outcomes.","Rosen, Hadar Bart Yossi Zlatkin Rita Ben-Sira Liat Ben Bashat Dafna Amit Sharon Cohen Carmit Regev-Yochay Gili Yinon Yoav",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,470

385636,Characteristics and risk factors associated with critical illness in pediatric COVID-19,2021,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2, along with the lack of targeted medicaments, encouraged research of existing drugs for repurposing. The rapid response to SARS-CoV-2 infection comprises a complex interaction of cytokine storm, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and pathologic coagulation. Thus, active molecules targeting multiple steps in SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle are highly wanted. Herein we explored the in silico capability of silibinin from Silybum marianum to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 main target proteins, and the in vitro effects against cytokine-induced-inflammation and dysfunction in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Computational analysis revealed that silibinin forms a stable complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD, has good negative binding affinity with Mpro, and interacts with many residues on the active site of Mpro, thus supporting its potentiality in inhibiting viral entry and replication. Moreover, HUVECs pretreatment with silibinin reduced TNF-&#945;-induced gene expression of the proinflammatory genes IL-6 and MCP-1, as well as of PAI-1, a critical factor in coagulopathy and thrombosis, and of ET-1, a peptide involved in hemostatic vasoconstriction. Then, due to endothelium antiinflammatory and anticoagulant properties of silibinin and its capability to interact with SARS-CoV-2 main target proteins demonstrated herein, silibinin could be a strong candidate for COVID-19 management from a multitarget perspective.","Speciale, Antonio; Muscarà, Claudia; Molonia, Maria Sofia; Cimino, Francesco; Saija, Antonella; Giofrè, Salvatore Vincenzo",Phytother. res,,470

Conversely, flavored milk sales remain strong, but many adults avoid flavored milk because of concerns about added sugar and calories and/or excessive sweetness. Here we used two discrete choice experiments to assess interest for a dark chocolate milk drink in adults, and explored whether there might be a consumer segment who prefers a more bitter, lower sugar chocolate milk. Adults were recruited from the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States for two conjoint analysis studies. In a general population cohort (n = 735), type of sweetener was the most important attribute (24%), followed by milk fat (19%), grams of added sugar (16%), front of pack messaging (15%), package type (12%), carton size (8%), and protein content (6%). Attribute importance was relatively consistent in a second study with a younger, more physically active cohort (n = 1017). Product choices in the active cohort were related to orthorexia and physically activity scores, indicating revealed preferences in a choice task are reflective of personal lifestyle and eating behavior. In both cohorts, three consistent consumer segments were identified and characterized: the calorie conscious, the average consumer, and the natural eaters. These data can help uncover lifestyle differences between adult consumers that impact their food product choices.","Brodock, Jennifer L; Hayes, John E; Masterson, Travis D; Hopfer, Helene",Appetite,,470

The complicated forms of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can evolve to multiple-organ failure, including several coagulopathies related to a sudden worsening of respiratory status. This article aimed to review studies about hematological and hemostatic laboratory disorders directly related to COVID-19 and to discuss how SARS-CoV-2 causes these abnormalities. The coagulation cascade model is associated with both COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement. Laboratory changes are relevant to evaluate the coagulation state - D-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), platelet count and fibrinogen. Pregnants and patients in Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) need special attention. Prophylactic interventions for COVID-19 coagulopathy should consider patients at risk for thrombotic events and potential contraindications. The mechanisms exerted by SARS-CoV-2 that impairs hemostatic balance include endothelial injury, inflammation, activation of the immune and complement systems. For diagnosis of coagulopathy, mainly Ddimer, but also PT, APTT and FDP, should be evaluated in COVID-19 patients. Intervention possibilities vary between lowmolecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and Unfractionated Heparin (UFH). Up to now, there is sufficient evidence that acutelyill patients with risk factors for coagulopathies will benefit from thrombophylaxis during hospitalization and post-discharge, but not all patients.","Pena, Ana Luísa Batista; Oliveira, Rafael Arantes; Severo, Renata Gomes; Simões E Silva, Ana Cristina",Curr. med. chem,,470

Hence, in the current study, selected PhACs, heavy metals (HMs), and physicochemical parameters (PCPs) were measured from the surface waters of the River Cauvery during the pre- and post-monsoon. PhACs such as caffeine, carbamazepine, and diclofenac were detected in most samples, whereas topiramate, ibuprofen, and verapamil were found only in few stations. In contrast, the distribution of ciprofloxacin, atenolol, and isoprenaline was strongly influenced by the seasonal pattern (p < 0.05). PhACs such as loperamide, glafenine, erythromycin, and gemfibrozil were not detected during the study. Distribution of PhACs based on average concentration (ng/L) are, CBZ (205.62) > CAF (114.09) > DCF (28.51) > CIP (25.23) > ATL (18.86) > IPL (13.91) > PPL (11.26) > TCS (10.39) > IBF (7.34) > TPT (3.09) > VPL (1.16). Bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses have revealed a positive correlation expressed by the majority of the PhACs with PCPs (COD, TOC), nutrients (TN, TP), and HMs (Pb, Mn, Ni) in the range from 0.540** to 0.961**(p < 0.01).

Here, we study both intradermal and intramuscular 2-dose delivery regimens of an advanced synthetic DNA vaccine candidate encoding a full-length MERS-CoV spike (S) protein, which induced potent binding and neutralizing antibodies as well as cellular immune responses in rhesus macaques. In a MERS-CoV challenge, all immunized rhesus macaques exhibited reduced clinical symptoms, lowered viral lung load, and decreased severity of pathological signs of disease compared with controls. Intradermal vaccination was dose sparing and more effective in this model at protecting animals from disease. The data support the further study of this vaccine for preventing MERS-CoV infection and transmission, including investigation of such vaccines and simplified delivery routes against emerging coronaviruses.","Patel, Ami; Reuschel, Emma L; Xu, Ziyang; Zaidi, Faraz I; Kim, Kevin Y; Scott, Dana P; Mendoza, Janess; Ramos, Stephanie; Stoltz, Regina; Feldmann, Friederike; Okumura, Atsushi; Meade-White, Kimberly; Haddock, Elaine; Thomas, Tina; Rosenke, Rebecca; Lovaglio, Jamie; Hanley, Patrick W; Saturday, Greg; Muthumani, Kar; Feldmann, Heinz; Humeau, Laurent M; Broderick, Kate E; Weiner, David B",JCI insight,,470
389650,PRO103 The IMPACT of COVID-19 on the Future Pricing and Market Access of RARE Diseases and CELL-/GENE-Therapies,2020,"Work engagement and stress experience of health professionals in times of the corona pandemic Abstract. Background: The corona pandemic, caused by the novel viral disease COVID-19, has led to excessive strain in health professionals whose general occupational situation in itself is associated with high levels of stress. So far, there is no quantitative data on the stress experience caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in German health professionals and on the consequences of this experience for their commitment to work. METHOD: With a cross-sectional design, German health professionals were asked about their stress experience, health concerns and work commitment. The snapshot survey used self-developed questions plus items of a validated scale measuring work engagement. A convenience sample of health professionals was recruited through social media. The E-Survey reached 1168 valid cases, the majority of which were nurses (80.4 %, n = 855). RESULTS: The evaluation shows that health professionals in direct contact with COVID-19 patients show higher stress levels than participants with no contact and that their main concern is about the health of relatives, friends and family. In addition, it was found that the participants' work commitment decreased parallel to the increase in pandemic-related stress. DISCUSSION: The study shows significant correlations between work demands, stress experience and work engagement. In contrast to earlier studies, the results for work engagement in the sample are relatively low. There is a growing number of international recommendations for reducing work-related stress factors in a pandemic which should now be implemented in Germany on a large scale. These include, amongst others, pandemic specific catalogues of prevention measures and the creation of a blame-free work environment.","Wildgruber, Domenika; Frey, Jana; Seer, Max; Pinther, Kristina; Koob, Clemens; Reuschenbach, Bernd",Pflege,,470

389705,The use of learning management systems in ESP to explore postgraduate students content knowledge about epidemiology and COVID-19: A mixed-methods study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Creating an ontology for COVID-19 surveillance should help ensure transparency and consistency. Ontologies formalize conceptualizations at either the domain or application level. Application ontologies cross domains and are specified through testable use cases. Our use case was an extension of the role of the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) to monitor the current pandemic and become an in-pandemic research platform. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop an application ontology for COVID-19 that can be deployed across the various use-case domains of the RCGP RSC research and surveillance activities. METHODS: We described our domain-specific use case. The actor was the RCGP RSC sentinel network, the system was the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the outcomes were the spread and effect of mitigation measures. We used our established 3-step method to develop the ontology, separating ontological concept development from code mapping and data extract validation. We developed a coding system-independent COVID-19 case identification algorithm. As there were no gold-standard pandemic surveillance ontologies, we conducted a rapid Delphi consensus exercise through the International Medical Informatics Association Primary Health Care Informatics working group and extended networks. RESULTS: Our use-case domains included primary care, public health, virology, clinical research, and clinical informatics. Our ontology supported (1) case identification, microbiological sampling, and health outcomes at an individual practice and at the national level; (2) feedback through a dashboard; (3) a national observatory; (4) regular updates for Public Health England; and (5) transformation of a sentinel network into a trial platform. We have identified a total of 19,115 people with a definite COVID-19 status, 5226 probable cases, and 74,293 people with possible COVID-19, within the RCGP RSC network (N=5,370,225). CONCLUSIONS: The underpinning structure of our ontological approach has coped with multiple clinical coding challenges. At a time when there is uncertainty about international comparisons, clarity about the basis on which case definitions and outcomes are made from routine data is essential.","de Lusignan, Simon; Liyanage, Harshana; McGagh, Dylan; Jani, Bhautesh Dinesh; Bauwens, Jorgen; Byford, Rachel; Evans, Dai; Fahey, Tom; Greenhalgh, Trisha; Jones, Nicholas; Mair, Frances S; Okusi, Cecilia; Parimalanathan, Vaishnavi; Pell, Jill P; Sherlock, Julian; Tamburis, Oscar; Tripathy, Manasa; Ferreira, Filipa; Williams, John; Hobbs, F D Richard",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,470

390664,Depression and anxiety prevalence in nursing staff during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) plays an important role in the regulation of ovarian function. Despite its extensive study in several species, there is a paucity of information about IGF-1`s function and localization in the canine ovary. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of IGF-1 on oocyte nuclear maturation and to immunolocalize the IGF-1 and its receptor (IGF-1R) in the ovary. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were obtained from 34 bitches. The COCs from each bitch were incubated in TCM 199-HEPES in the absence (n = 199) or presence (n = 204) of 100 ng/ml IGF-1 for 96 hr at 38ºC in 5% CO2 , stained and evaluated for nuclear maturation by fluorescence microscopy. The results showed that the addition of IGF-1 did not have an effect (p Ë 0.05) on the nuclear maturation under these conditions. The immunohistochemical study revealed nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for IGF-1 and IGF-1R, respectively. Both were localized in all ovarian structures including the corpus luteum, but not in the granulosa cells from primordial follicles. In addition, IGF-1 was not localized in the oocytes in tertiary follicles. The results obtained show the presence of IGF-1 through the stages of follicular growth and in the corpus luteum of the canine ovary. However, its role on oocyte nuclear maturation could not be demonstrated.","Cardilli, Diogo J; Sousa-Oliveira, Kellen; Franchi-João, Carolina; Azevedo-Voorwald, Faviana; Machado-Silva, Marco A; Oliveira, João Ademir; Sánchez-Calabuig, María Jesús; Toniollo, Gilson H; Pérez-Gutiérrez, José F",Vet. med. sci,,470

Reports of COVID-19 with central (CNS) and peripheral nervous (PNS) system manifestations are emerging. In this systematic review, we compared and summarized the demographics, clinical features, Brighton criteria, immunological and laboratory findings with a focus on modified Erasmus GBS Outcome Score (mEGOS) in SARS-CoV-2 patients with GBS and its variants. METHODS: Based on PRISMA guidelines, we searched three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar) for studies on COVID-19 and GBS between December 1, 2019 to July 15, 2020. For descriptive analysis, we studied two groups with: 1) acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) variant, and 2) Non-AIDP/Other variants. We compared mEGOS scores for patients in both groups along with other key clinical features. RESULTS: Of the 50 GBS cases identified from 37 studies, 33 (66%) had acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopolyneuropathy (AIDP) while 17 (34%) were of other (non-AIDP) variants. There mEGOS scores did not differ between AIDP patients and AMAN/AMSAN patients. Majority of the AIDP (66.7%) and AMAN/AMSAN (57.2%) patients belonged to Brighton level 1 indicating maximum diagnostic certainty. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is among the first reviews that includes GBS variants and the clinical prediction tool mEGOS for prognostication in COVID-19 patients. Further research is needed to assess whether IVIG is preferable over plasmapheresis in this population of GBS patients. It would also be crucial to follow these patients over time to identify the long-term disability as well as treatment outcomes.","Sriwastava, Shitiz; Kataria, Saurabh; Tandon, Medha; Patel, Jenil; Patel, Riddhi; Jowkar, Abbas; Daimee, Maha; Bernitsas, Evanthia; Jaiswal, Preeti; Lisak, Robert P",J Neurol Sci,,470

Little research has addressed potential inequalities in access, with no research on variations before and since COVID-19. The aim of this study was to explore inequalities in social support service usage before and since the pandemic. METHODS: Unpaid carers and people living with dementia were interviewed over the phone about their experiences of accessing social support services before and since the COVID-19 pandemic. Transcripts were analysed for key themes using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Fifty participants (42 unpaid carers; eight people living with dementia) were interviewed, and five themes identified: (1) Service issues; (2) Access issues; (3) Relying on own initiative; (4) New inequalities due to COVID-19; and (5) Missing out on the benefits of support services. Participants reported transport, finances, and location as factors reducing their ability to access support service pre-COVID, with inequalities remaining and at times exacerbated since. Carers and people living with dementia also reported struggling with accessing basic necessities during COVID, including food and medicines.

Treatment for soft tissue defect combined with chronic osteomyelitis in the lateral malleolus has rarely been reported. The aim of this study was to elaborate the superiority of the DPAPF flap and provide referential experience for using the DPAPF flap in this situation. Between June 2010 and December 2017, soft tissue defects in the setting of chronic osteomyelitis in the lateral malleolus were reconstructed with DPAPF flaps in 17 patients. After thorough debridement, the defect was repaired with the DPAPF flap, and patients subsequently followed an antibiotic regimen for 6 weeks. Follow-up periods for all patients were at least 24 months. The reconstruction outcomes and the satisfaction of the 17 patients were evaluated. Of the 17 flaps, 16 survived uneventfully, except one occurrence of partial necrosis. No infection occurred in the follow-up period. In the study, 17 patients except one were satisfied with flap appearance. All the patients were satisfied with the reconstruction outcomes. In a one-stage procedure, the use of DPAPF flaps is ideal for reconstructing soft tissue defects in the setting of chronic osteomyelitis in the lateral malleolus.","Luo, Zhaobiao; Dong, Zhonggen; Ni, Jiangdong; Wei, Jianwei; Peng, Ping; Lv, Guohua",Int J Low Extrem Wounds,,470

This deadly virus caused the world to be in high alert as the death toll and the number of confirmed cases is continuously rising since the first case was reported. The Chinese government warned that the transmission ability of the virus is increasing, and international efforts are needed to overcome this outbreak. The purpose of this review is to focus on the published articles about the new virus, which will give an insight into the current state of research and data available, as well as recommending future studies. Methods: For this narrative review, more than 20 relevant scientific articles and reports were considered from various databases (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed and Science Direct) using keywords such as Coronavirus Outbreak, COVID-19, Emerging Epidemics, Emerging Infections, and Novel Coronavirus. Results: The results from this review show that the situation is rapidly evolving, as human-to-human transmission is occurring, and the number of new cases and mortalities is increasing by the day and on a global level. There is still ambiguity about mutation risks and how the virus spreads as the source was not yet identified.

395576,A Viewpoint From Paris on the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Necessary Turn to Telepsychiatry,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To identify markers associated with in-hospital death in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 140 patients with moderate to critical COVID-19-associated pneumonia requiring oxygen supplementation admitted to the hospital from January 28, 2020, through February 28, 2020, and followed up through March 13, 2020, in Union Hospital, Wuhan, China. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) and other measures were tested as predictors of in-hospital mortality in survival analysis. RESULTS: Of 140 patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia, 72 (51.4%) were men, with a median age of 60 years. Patients with SpO2 values of 90% or less were older and were more likely to be men, to have hypertension, and to present with dyspnea than those with SpO2 values greater than 90%. Overall, 36 patients (25.7%) died during hospitalization after median 14-day follow-up. Higher SpO2 levels after oxygen supplementation were associated with reduced mortality independently of age and sex (hazard ratio per 1-U SpO2, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.95; P<.001). The SpO2 cutoff value of 90.5% yielded 84.6% sensitivity and 97.2% specificity for prediction of survival. Dyspnea was also independently associated with death in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.24 to 5.43; P=.01). CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with COVID-19, hypoxemia was independently associated with in-hospital mortality. These results may help guide the clinical management of patients with severe COVID-19, particularly in settings requiring strategic allocation of limited critical care resources.

Though charitable crowdfunding has been popular in recent years, the widespread creation of COVID-19 related campaigns points to potential shifts in how the platform is being used, and the volume of needs users have brought to the site during a profound economic, social, and epidemiological crisis. This study offers a systematic examination of the scope and impacts of COVID-19 related crowdfunding in the early months of the pandemic and assesses how existing social and health inequities shaped crowdfunding use and outcomes. Using data collected from all US-based GoFundMe campaigns mentioning COVID or coronavirus, we used descriptive analysis and a series of negative binomial and linear models to assess the contributions of demographic factors and COVID-19 impacts to campaign creation and outcome. We find significant evidence of growing inequalities in outcomes for campaigners. We find that crowdfunding provides substantially higher benefits in wealthier counties with higher levels of education. People from these areas are more likely to initiate campaigns in response to adverse health and economic impacts of COVID-19, and they also receive more funding compared to people living in areas with lower income and education. Modeling also indicates differential outcomes based on the racial and ethnic composition of county population, though without more detail about who is creating and funding campaigns we cannot explain causality. A targeted qualitative analysis of the top earning COVID-19 campaigns offers further evidence of how user privilege and corporate practices contribute to highly unequal outcomes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate how a market-oriented digital technology used to respond to large-scale crisis can exacerbate inequalities and further benefit already privileged groups.","Igra, Mark; Kenworthy, Nora; Luchsinger, Cadence; Jung, Jin-Kyu",Soc Sci Med,,470

The simple and painless process of saliva collection allows for widespread testing, but enthusiasm is hampered by variable performance compared to nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. We prospectively collected paired NPS and saliva samples from a total of 300 unique adult and pediatric patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 32.2% (97/300) of the individuals using the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher). Performance of saliva and NPS were compared against the total number of positives regardless of specimen type. The overall concordance for saliva and NPS was 91.0% (273/300) and 94.7% (284/300), respectively. The positive percent agreement (PPA) for saliva and NPS was 81.4% (79/97) and 89.7% (87/97), respectively. Saliva detected 10 positive cases that were negative by NPS. In symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric patients not previously diagnosed with COVID-19, the performances of saliva and NPS were comparable (PPA: 82.4% vs 85.3%). The overall PPA for adults were 83.3% and 90.7% for saliva and NPS, respectively, with saliva detecting 4 cases less than NPS. However, saliva performance in symptomatic adults was identical to NPS (PPA of 93.8%). With lower cost and self-collection capabilities, saliva can be an appropriate alternative sample choice to NPS for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adults.","Yee, Rebecca; Truong, Thao; Pannaraj, Pia S; Eubanks, Natalie; Gai, Emily; Jumarang, Jaycee; Turner, Lauren; Peralta, Ariana; Lee, Yesun; Dien Bard, Jennifer",J. clin. microbiol,,470
396355,Algorithm for the classification of COVID-19 rashes,2020,"Circle-to-circle amplification (C2CA) is a specific and precise cascade nucleic acid amplification method consisting of more than one round of padlock probe ligation and rolling circle amplification (RCA). Although C2CA provides a high amplification efficiency with a negligible increase of false-positive risk, it contains several step-by-step operation processes. We herein demonstrate a homogeneous and isothermal nucleic acid quantification strategy based on C2CA and optomagnetic analysis of magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) assembly. The proposed homogeneous circle-to-circle amplification eliminates the need for additional monomerization and ligation steps after the first round of RCA, and combines two amplification rounds in a one-pot reaction. The second round of RCA produces amplicon coils that anneal to detection probes grafted onto MNPs, resulting in MNP assembly that can be detected in real-time using an optomagnetic sensor. The proposed methodology was applied for the detection of a synthetic complementary DNA of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also known as 2019-nCoV) RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) coding sequence, achieving a detection limit of 0.4 fM with a dynamic detection range of 3 orders of magnitude and a total assay time of ca. 100 min. A mathematical model was set up and validated to predict the assay performance. Moreover, the proposed method was specific to distinguish SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 sequences with high similarity.","Tian, Bo; Gao, Fei; Fock, Jeppe; Dufva, Martin; Hansen, Mikkel Fougt",Biosens Bioelectron,,470
396498,The evolution of ultrasound role in COVID-19 pandemic: from triage to screening,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected nephrology. Firstly, dialysis patients appear to be at increased risk for infection due to viral transmission next to an enhanced risk for mortality as compared to the general population, even in the face of an often apparently mild clinical presentation. Derangements in the innate and adaptive immune systems may be responsible for a reduced antiviral response, whereas chronic activation of the innate immune system and endothelial dysfunction provide a background for a more severe course. The presence of severe comorbidity, older age, and a reduction of organ reserve may lead to a rapid deterioration of the clinical situation of the patients in case of severe infection. Secondly, patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), which is related to the severity of the clinical disease. The presence of AKI, and especially the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), is associated with an increased risk of mortality. AKI in COVID-19 has a multifactorial origin, in which direct viral invasion of kidney cells, activation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, a hyperinflammatory response, hypercoagulability, and nonspecific factors such as hypotension and hypoxemia may be involved. Apart from logistic challenges and the need for strict hygiene within units, treatment of patients with ESRD and COVID-19 is not different from that of the general population. Extracorporeal treatment of patients with AKI with RRT can be complicated by frequent filter clotting due to the hypercoagulable state, for which regional citrate coagulation provides a reasonable solution.

400238,The Turkish adaptation and psychometric characteristics of the COVID-19 Traumatic Stress Scale,2021,"This article analyses the development of financial assistance in the Eurozone since 2010. It argues that reforms to instruments and bodies, notably the European Financial Stability Facility, the European Stability Mechanism, and the current Covid-19 recovery fund, are best explained by a re-occurring pattern of negotiations between potential creditors and debtors based on common Eurozone interests and national cost-benefit considerations. Building on a liberal inter-governmentalist approach, this article shows how this pattern influenced the step-by-step reform of financial assistance in the Eurozone. The threat to Eurozone stability served as a constant factor encouraging Member States to expand and deepen the assistance formula. Creditors' cost-benefit considerations were key for retaining disincentives, a limited liability for common debt, and intermediary borrowing and lending within the financing design. However, on the back of common Eurozone interests, debtors were able to push for an increase in assistance, an expansion of assistance into areas of banking sector support, and a softening of moral hazard elements in the more recent Covid-19 pandemic. Due to creditors' continuous insistence on safeguards and limited burden-sharing, reform outcomes were repeatedly unable to resolve the difficulties at hand.","Rehm, M.",Politics and Governance,,470

METHODS: We collected facility-based and household costs of all nine pregnant women with COVID-19 managed at the hospital. We compared their mean facility-based costs with those paid by pregnant women pre-COVID-19, identifying cost-drivers. We also estimated what would have been paid without subsidies, testing assumptions with a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Total utilization costs ranged from US $494 for SVD with mild COVID-19 to US $4553 for emergency CD with severe COVID-19. Though 32%-66% of facility-based cost were subsidized, costs of SVD and CD during the pandemic have doubled and tripled, respectively, compared with those paid pre-COVID-19. Of the facility-based costs, cost of personal protective equipment was the major cost-driver (50%). Oxygen was the major driver for women with severe COVID-19 (48%). Excluding treatment costs for COVID-19, mean facility-based costs were US $228 (SVD) and US $948 (CD). CONCLUSION: Despite cost exemptions and donations, utilization costs remain prohibitive. Regulation of personal protective equipment and medical oxygen supply chains and expansion of advocacy for health insurance enrollments are needed in order to minimize catastrophic health expenditure.","Banke-Thomas, Aduragbemi; Makwe, Christian Chigozie; Balogun, Mobolanle; Afolabi, Bosede Bukola; Alex-Nwangwu, Theresa Amaogechukwu; Ameh, Charles Anawo",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,,470

Creating awareness and understanding patient concerns will play an important role in protecting this vulnerable group in developing timely and appropriate healthcare interventions. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between 23rd March 2020 and 1st April 2020 among 154 liver transplant recipients, transplanted between October 2018 and February 2020. An 18-point questionnaire explored their knowledge of COVID-19, awareness of recipient's high-risk status, interventions to minimize cross-infections, and concerns of this patient group regarding the pandemic. Results: There were 112 (73%) respondents, with median age of 53 years (81% males). There was no difference in demographics between those who responded (n = 112) and those who did not respond to the survey (n = 42). Most of the recipients were aware of the main symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever (92%), breathlessness (86%), and dry cough (87%), but less than half were aware of diarrhea (39%) as a symptom. Awareness about spread from asymptomatic individuals was limited (26%). Majority (95%) understood their high-risk status, but worryingly, 23% of the respondents felt that there was no risk in visiting the hospital for routine clinic visit and blood tests. Concerns were raised by the recipients mostly regarding the uncertainties of COVID-19 infection and its treatment options, the quality of information on social messaging platforms, and lack of access to routine tests/immunosuppression levels because of lockdown/social distancing. Conclusions: Our liver transplant recipients have a reasonable awareness regarding COVID-19. Problems in accessing the healthcare system during prolonged periods of lockdown was a major concern. It is important for each transplant unit to educate, support, and remain accessible to this vulnerable patient cohort as the pandemic continues to progress worldwide.","Hakeem, Abdul R; Padmanaban, Hrishikesh; Karthikeyan, Srinath; Murugesan, Sivakumar; Menon, Jagadeesh; Shanmugam, Naresh; Jothimani, Dinesh; Reddy, Mettu S; Rela, Mohamed",,,470

Background: The COVID-19 outbreak is a serious health problem to human beings. The evidence suggests that inflammatory markers related to liver damage increase in severe forms of COVID-19 compared to mild cases. Methods: The electronic databases ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were comprehensively searched for articles published up to May, 2020. Data from each identified study was combined using the random effects model to estimate standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Sensitivity and publication bias were also calculated. Results: Totally, 23 studies were included in this meta-analysis comprising 4313 patients with COVID-19. The random effects results demonstrated that patients with severe COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of CRP [SMD = 3.26 mg/L; (95% CI 2.5, 3.9); p<0.05; I2 = 98.02%; PHeterogeneity = 0.00], TNF&#945; [SMD = 1.78 ng/mL; (95% CI 0.39, 3.1); p=0.012; I2 = 98.2%; PHeterogeneity = 0.00], and IL-6 [ SMD = 3.67 ng/mL; (95% CI 2.4, 4.8); p<0.05; I2 = 97.8%; PHeterogeneity = 0.00] compared with those with the mild form of the disease. Significant heterogeneity was present. No significant publication bias was observed in the meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses showed a similar effect size while reducing the heterogeneity. Conclusion: The data suggests that enhanced inflammation may be associated with COVID-19-related liver damage, possibly involving inflammatory marker-related mechanisms.","Amiri-Dashatan, Nasrin; Koushki, Mehdi; Ghorbani, Fatemeh; Naderi, Nosratollah",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,,470

Materials and Methods: A prospective review of all patients undergoing percutaneous drain placement in IR between March and August 2020 was carried out (n = 98). All patients undergoing percutaneous drainage of a fluid collection with eventual discharge to home were included. Those with indwelling tubes at the end of the study period were excluded (n = 20). A total of 78 drains met inclusion criteria. Patients were instructed on how to utilize the virtual log, which included daily drain outputs, presence/absence of leakage (spontaneous or with flushing), and daily body temperature prior to discharge. This virtual log was accessed by patients through the patient portal via a computer or smart phone and was integrated into the electronic medical record for provider review. A Fisher’s exact test was used to compare percent compliance during phase I and phase II. Unpaired two-tailed t-tests were used to compare mean time to tube removal (mTTR). Results: Compliance with virtual drain log usage was 30.8% [24/78] with no significant difference between phase I and II (P &gt; 0.05). mTTR ± SE was 44.7 ± 7.1 days in patients who did not use the virtual log, compared with 36.9 ± 8.2 days in patients who did use the virtual log with a difference of 7.8 days, which did not reach statistical significance (P &gt; 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference of 30.6 days in overall mTTR between phase I and phase II (P = 0.007) with a significant difference of 34.5 days between phase I and phase II in the sub-group that did not use the virtual drain log (P = 0.018). There was no significant difference between phase I and phase II in the group that used the virtual drain log. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a significantly increased mTTR in patients who did not use a virtual drain log during the most restrictive phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: An observational analysis was performed on pregnant women who were not infected with COVID-19. A total of 135 pregnant women (group 1), 45 of whom were in the first trimester, 45 in the second trimester, and 45 in the third trimester, and 45 healthy women who were not pregnant (group 2), were included in the study. The FSFI was used to assess sexual dysfunction status. RESULTS: A total of 118 (87.4%) pregnant participants and 31 (68.9%) non-pregnant participants were diagnosed as having sexual dysfunction according to the FSFI. When comparing groups 1 and 2, FSFI scores were significantly lower in group 1 (p = 0.002). It was also found that women who had university degrees, were multiparous, and in the third trimester were more likely to develop sexual dysfunction (p = 0.030, p = 0.029, and p = 0.001, respectively). FSFI scores were found to be significantly higher in planned pregnancies than in unplanned pregnancies (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The sexual function of uninfected pregnant women decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively influenced by restrictive social distancing measures.","Karakas, Latife A; Azemi, Asli; Simsek, Seda Y; Akilli, Huseyin; Esin, Sertac",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,,470

Pharmaceutical research against COVID-19 and the most frequently used tests for SARS-CoV-2 both depend on the genomic and peptide sequences of the virus for their robustness. Therefore, understanding the mutation rates and content of the virus is critical. Two key proteins for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication are the S protein, responsible for viral entry into the cells, and RdRp, the RNA polymerase responsible for replicating the viral genome. Due to their roles in the viral cycle, these proteins are crucial for the fitness and infectiousness of the virus. Our previous findings had shown that the two most frequently observed mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, 14408C>T in the RdRp coding region, and 23403A>G in the S gene, are correlated with higher mutation density over time. In this study, we further detail the selection dynamics and the mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 genes, comparing them between isolates carrying both mutations, and isolates carrying neither. We find that the S gene and the RdRp coding region show the highest variance between the genotypes, and their selection dynamics contrast each other over time. The S gene displays higher tolerance for positive selection in mutant isolates early during the appearance of the double mutant genotype, and undergoes increasing negative selection over time, whereas the RdRp region in the mutant isolates shows strong negative selection throughout the pandemic.","Koçhan, Necla; Eskier, Doga; Suner, Asli; Karakülah, Gökhan; Oktay, Yavuz",Infect Genet Evol,,470

408831,Characterising neuropsychiatric disorders in patients with COVID-19,2020,"Vast efforts are directed today toward the development of efficient, green methods for the degradation of toxic compounds, especially those that are water-soluble. Though Fenton reactions are commonly used in wastewater treatment, their mechanisms and the active species involved remain obscure due to their mechanistic complexity. In this work, the mechanism of an electro-Fenton reaction, in which a FeLaO3 catalyst was entrapped in a sol-gel matrix, was studied in the presence of azo dyes as the model for toxic compounds. Increased knowledge about this important mechanism will confer greater control over related processes and enable a more efficient and green degradation method. DFT calculations showed that in the presence of Fe(IV), OH are formed under acidic conditions and that both the iron and hydroxyl species function as oxidation reagents in the degradation process. The structure of the formed Fe(IV) embedded in the solid matrix was not the typical tetravalent structure. Entrapment in the sol-gel matrix stabilized the catalyst, enhanced its efficiency and enabled it to be recycled. Sol-gel matrices constitute a simple method for the degradation of stable and toxic compounds under extreme pH conditions. The findings of this study are highly significant for the treatment of typically acidic wastewaters.","Biton Seror, Shira; Shamir, Dror; Albo, Yael; Kornweitz, Haya; Burg, Ariela",Chemosphere,,470

Our health care system is unprepared for the complexity of caring for a heterogenous population of older adults-a problem that has been magnified by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Here, as part of the National Academy of Medicine's Vital Directions for Health and Health Care: Priorities for 2021 initiative, we identify six vital directions to improve the care and quality of life for all older Americans. The next administration must create an adequately prepared workforce; strengthen the role of public health; remediate disparities and inequities; develop, evaluate, and implement new approaches to care delivery; allocate resources to achieve patient-centered care and outcomes, including palliative and end-of-life care; and redesign the structure and financing of long-term services and supports. If these priorities are addressed proactively, an infrastructure can be created that promotes better health and equitable, goal-directed care that recognizes the preferences and needs of older adults.","Fulmer, Terry; Reuben, David B; Auerbach, John; Fick, Donna Marie; Galambos, Colleen; Johnson, Kimberly S",Health Aff (Millwood),,470
410107,"Geriatric Telemedicine: Ensuring continuity of healthcare services to the older patients in Kedah, Malaysia during the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"Pulmonary mycoses are difficult to treat and detrimental to patients. Fungal infections modulate the lung immune response, and induce goblet cell hyperplasia and metaplasia, and mucus hypersecretion in the airways. Excessive mucus clogs small airways and reduces pulmonary function by decreasing oxygen exchange, leading to respiratory distress. The Forkhead box protein, FOXA2, is a transcription factor that regulates mucus homeostasis in the airways. However, little is known whether pulmonary mycosis modulates FOXA2 function. Here, we investigated whether Blastomyces dermatitidis and Histoplasma capsulatum-infected canine and feline lungs and airway epithelial cells could serve as higher animal models to examine the relationships between fungal pneumonia and FOXA2-regulated airway mucus homeostasis. The results indicated that fungal infection downregulated FOXA2 expression in airway epithelial cells, with concomitant overexpression of MUC5AC and MUC5B mucins. Mechanistic studies revealed that B. dermatitidis infection, as well as ß-glucan exposure, activated the Dectin-1-SYK-EGFR-AKT/ERK1/2 signaling pathway that inhibits the expression of FOXA2, resulting in overexpression of MUC5AC and MUC5B in canine airway cells. Further understanding of the role of FOXA2 in mucus hypersecretion may lead to novel therapeutics against excessive mucus in both human and veterinary patients with pulmonary mycosis.","Choi, Woosuk; Yang, Alina Xiaoyu; Sieve, Aaron; Kuo, Shanny Hsuan; Mudalagiriyappa, Srinivasu; Vieson, Miranda; Maddox, Carol W; Nanjappa, Som G; Lau, Gee W",Am. j. pathol,,470

It has been proven to be a feasible source of biologically relevant elements (K, Fe, Ca), vitamins (A, B1, B2, C) as well as bioactive compounds (inulin, sesquiterpene lactones, coumarin derivatives, cichoric acid, phenolic acids), which exert potent pro-health effects on the human organism. It displays choleretic and digestion-promoting, as well as appetite-increasing, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial action, all owing to its varied phytochemical composition. Hence, chicory is used most often to treat gastrointestinal disorders. Chicory was among the plants with potential against SARS-CoV-2, too. To this and other ends, roots, herb, flowers and leaves are used. Apart from its phytochemical applications, chicory is also used in gastronomy as a coffee substitute, food or drink additive.

Considering the limited access to diagnostic investigations in primary care practice, chest X-ray remains the imaging modality of choice. The current study assessed the competency of family medicine residents in the interpretation of chest X-rays for emergency conditions and to compare it with that of diagnostic radiology residents, general practitioners, and medical interns. METHODS: An online survey was distributed to 600 physicians, including family medicine residents, medical interns, general practitioners, and diagnostic radiology residents. The study included some background information such as gender, years in practice, training type, interest in pulmonary medicine and diagnostic radiology, and having adequate training on the interpretation of chest X-rays. The survey had 10 chest X-ray cases with brief clinical information. Participants were asked to choose the most likely diagnosis and to rate their degree of confidence in the interpretation of the chest X-ray for each case. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 205 physicians (response rate = 34.2%). The overall diagnostic accuracy was 63.1% with a significant difference between family medicine and radiology residents (58.0% vs. 90.5%; P < 0.001). The COVID-19 pneumonia (85.4%) and pneumoperitoneum (80.5%) cases had the highest diagnostic accuracy scores. There was a significant correlation between the diagnostic confidence and accuracy (rs = 0.39; P < 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that being diagnostic radiology residents (odds ratio [OR]: 13.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5-67.7) and having higher diagnostic confidence (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3-3.8) were the only independent predictors of achieving high diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSION: The competency of family medicine residents in the interpretation of chest X-ray for emergency conditions was far from optimal. The introduction of radiology training courses on emergency conditions seems imperative. Alternatively, the use of tele-radiology in primary healthcare centers should be considered.","Al Shammari, Malak; Hassan, Ali; AlShamlan, Nouf; Alotaibi, Sarah; Bamashmoos, Manar; Hakami, Amani; Althunyan, Abdullatif; Basager, Shymaa; Motabgani, Sameerah; Aljubran, Sawsan; Alsaif, Hind S",BMC Fam Pract,,470

An ethical evaluation of current developments in Germany,2020,"The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, also known as COVID-19, has generated shockwaves in medical and surgical practice. It has necessitated re-deployment of staff and resources to cater for the unpredictable increase in footfall and demand on healthcare systems. This study aimed to investigate how the restructuring of our service altered the triage and management of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) during the pandemic's first wave rise and peak. We retrospectively analysed all patients who underwent a skin excision under local anaesthetic which revealed the presence of a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) on histopathological analysis between 1st February 2020 - 31st May 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. There was a 158% increase in patients with excision of lesions confirmed on histopathological analysis as a NMSC during the COVID-19 period (168â¯vs. 65). In 2020, more excisions were performed by consultants (42.9% v 21.5%, pâ¯=â¯0.002) with a lower proportion of excisions with a close margin (27.7% v 17.8%, pâ¯=â¯0.096) and an involved margin (3.1% v 1.8%, pâ¯=â¯0.62). Five of these patients had their further management altered due to service constraints at this time The resource constraints secondary to the pandemic have yielded beneficial service adaptations with the incorporation of a more efficient model for the NMSC service. The sustainability of this model and its impact on training will require further examination when non-urgent and benign elective workload is slowly reinstated and plastic surgery trainees return to their original posts.","Abbassi, O; Waseem, S; Murphy, S; Roszpopa, J; Nizamoglu, M; Patel, A J K; Durrani, A J",,,470
413263,Stress management interventions for college students in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought forward the centrality of public communication as a force for information, and in highlighting the differential impact on diverse segments of the society. Information and communication technologies-led developments including social media have previously been discussed as instruments of democratization of knowledge. However, the evidence so far shows that the promise remains unfulfilled as upper socioeconomic groups acquire information at a faster rate than others. The communication inequalities have only reinforced the existing societal fault lines of race, class and place. As the first pandemic of the social media age, COVID-19 has also given rise to an ""infodemic"", providing fertile ground for the spread of information, misinformation and disinformation. With limited gatekeeping, an immense amount of unprocessed scientific information is being put forward to publics not trained in science. In this commentary, we offer some propositions on how disinformation on COVID-19 has become mainstreamed through social media's spiral of amplification and what role public communication has in an emergency from a lens of equity. We raise the question of whether the tremendous flow of scientific information during the COVID-19 pandemic has a differential impact on different socioeconomic groups. We propose that more systematic research is urgently needed to understand how mis/disinformation originate, spread and what their consequences are. In our view, research in health communication inequalities is foundational to mitigating the current off-line and online ravages of the pandemic.","Viswanath, K; Lee, Edmund W J; Pinnamaneni, Ramya",Health Commun,,470

This would apply to dental students as well. Thus, it is important to achieve high COVID-19 vaccination rates in this group. Further, as healthcare providers, they are entrusted with providing health recommendations and advocating for their patients, community, and profession, including vaccinations. METHODS: Using ualtricsXM an online platform, in 2020, a survey was administered anonymously to dental students at three dental schools to assess the attitudes of dental students to the novel COVID-19 vaccine. Factors and reasons associated with vaccine hesitancy and acceptance toward the COVID-19 vaccine and likelihood of recommending and giving the vaccination to patients were assessed. RESULTS: Nearly, all participants had positive attitudes toward vaccines in general, agreed they would likely be exposed to COVID-19, and personally knew someone who had COVID-19; however, only 56% are willing to take a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as an FDA-approved vaccine was available. Of those unwilling to take the vaccine, 63% reported they would take it if mandated by the health systems/dental school; however, 16.3% of the overall respondents would not take the COVID-19 vaccine even if mandated. Several factors are associated with vaccine acceptance and the likelihood of recommending the vaccination, such as trusting public health experts, concerns about side effects, and agreeing with vaccine mandates.

414668,Validating potential organ and tissue donors in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic: Scoping review and recommendations construction,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed health systems globally. With the increase of global migration, quantifying the health needs and key correlates of these outcomes is a global health priority. This study assessed migration characteristics, COVID-19 attitudes and the postmigration social environment as key correlates of depression, quality of life and alcohol misuse among international migrants in China. DESIGN: A nationwide cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 17 February and 1 March 2020. SETTING: Links to the online survey were disseminated by migrant-focused community-based organisations through WeChat. PARTICIPANTS: English speaking international migrants who met the inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were being born in a country outside of China, aged 18 years or over, cumulatively living in China for 1 month or more and staying in China between December 2019 and February 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, quality of life and alcohol misuse. RESULTS: Regression models indicated that planning or considering leaving China due to COVID-19, lacking the confidence to protect themselves and not being confident that the epidemic would end soon was associated with greater depression, lower quality of life and greater levels of alcohol misuse. Worry about contracting COVID-19 and feeling helpless to prevent infection were associated with greater depression and lower quality of life. General perceived social support, and trust in Chinese people, institutions and systems were protective factors for depression and associated with higher reported quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies key correlates that, if adequately addressed through public health outreach, may safeguard migrant well-being during a public health emergency. Trust in people and systems within the postmigration environment is an important consideration for future public health planning efforts.","Hall, Brian J; Zhao, Peizhen; Xiong, Ming Zhou; Latkin, Carl; Yang, Bin; Wang, Cheng",BMJ Open,,470
414860,Three months of loneliness during the COVID-19 lockdown. (Special articles on mental health and COVID-19.),2020,"Mental health concerns of people impacted by the coronavirus pandemic have not been adequately addressed. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate the properties of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), which is a brief mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional anxiety associated with the COVID-19 crisis. This 5-item scale, which was based on 775 adults with anxiety over the coronavirus, demonstrated solid reliability and validity. Elevated CAS scores were found to be associated with coronavirus diagnosis, impairment, alcohol/drug coping, negative religious coping, extreme hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as attitudes toward President Trump and Chinese products. The CAS discriminates well between persons with and without dysfunctional anxiety using an optimized cut score of &#8805; 9 (90% sensitivity and 85% specificity). These results support the CAS as an efficient and valid tool for clinical research and practice.","Lee, Sherman A",Death Stud,,470

The disease has become life-threatening in a very short time with touching on most of the citizenry and economic systems globally. The novel virus, SARS-CoV-2 has been known as the causative agent of COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 is single stranded RNA virus having ~30 kb genomic components which are 70% identical to SARS-CoV. The main process of pathophysiology of COVID-19 has been associated with the interaction of a novel coronavirus with host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE 2) by fusion. Therapeutic agents having serine protease inhibitors and ACE-2 blockers may be explored for the treatment by inhibiting the viral target such as Mpro, RdRp, PLpro and helicase. Herbal medicine has a wide array chemical entity with potential health benefits including antiviral activity which may be explored as alternative treatment of COVID-19. The herbal bioactives like catechins, andrographolide, hesperidin, biorobin, scutellarein, silvestrol, shikonin, tryptanthrin, vitexin quercetin, myricetin, caffeic acid, psoralidin, luteolin etc have showed potential inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2.

We examine the prevalence and sources of weight-based victimization targeting youth, consequences of these stigmatizing experiences for their psychological and physical health, and considerations for addressing weight stigma in clinical practice and pediatric care. RECENT FINDINGS: Weight stigma is highly prevalent among youth with high body weight, who are targets of weight-based victimization from peers, parents, and teachers. These experiences place youth at risk for psychological distress (primarily depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, and suicidal ideation), worse social and academic outcomes, and adverse physical health consequences including maladaptive eating behaviors, lower physical activity, substance use, and weight gain. Healthcare professionals and clinicians have important roles to play in efforts to help reduce weight stigma and support youth with obesity. Fundamental to these efforts is the use of supportive, compassionate, and non-stigmatizing communication with youth and their families.","Puhl, Rebecca M; Lessard, Leah M",Curr. obes. rep,,470

415460,"Commentary: COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus: What we know, how our patients should be treated now, and what should happen next",2020,"Importance: Clinician burnout is a major risk to the health of the US. Nurses make up most of the health care workforce, and estimating nursing burnout and associated factors is vital for addressing the causes of burnout. Objective: To measure rates of nurse burnout and examine factors associated with leaving or considering leaving employment owing to burnout. Design, Setting, and Participants: This secondary analysis used cross-sectional survey data collected from April 30 to October 12, 2018, in the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses in the US. All nurses who responded were included (N = 3â¯957â¯661). Data were analyzed from June 5 to October 1, 2020. Exposures: Age, sex, race and ethnicity categorized by self-reported survey question, household income, and geographic region. Data were stratified by workplace setting, hours worked, and dominant function (direct patient care, other function, no dominant function) at work. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were the likelihood of leaving employment in the last year owing to burnout or considering leaving employment owing to burnout. Results: The 3 957 661 responding nurses were predominantly female (90.4%) and White (80.7%); the mean (weighted SD) age was 48.7 (0.04) years. Among nurses who reported leaving their job in 2017 (n = 418â¯769), 31.5% reported burnout as a reason, with lower proportions of nurses reporting burnout in the West (16.6%) and higher proportions in the Southeast (30.0%). Compared with working less than 20 h/wk, nurses who worked more than 40 h/wk had a higher likelihood identifying burnout as a reason they left their job (odds ratio, 3.28; 95% CI, 1.61-6.67). Respondents who reported leaving or considering leaving their job owing to burnout reported a stressful work environment (68.6% and 59.5%, respectively) and inadequate staffing (63.0% and 60.9%, respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that burnout is a significant problem among US nurses who leave their job or consider leaving their job. Health systems should focus on implementing known strategies to alleviate burnout, including adequate nurse staffing and limiting the number of hours worked per shift.","Shah, Megha K; Gandrakota, Nikhila; Cimiotti, Jeannie P; Ghose, Neena; Moore, Miranda; Ali, Mohammed K",JAMA Netw Open,,470

Based on my own observations and on observations shared by executives in New Zealand and Europe, I illustrate in this article how the lockdown acted as a facilitator for digital work. Further, I show how the lockdown gave many individuals a flawed impression of digital work, i.e. their experience occurred during exceptional circumstances and led them to draw false conclusions about digital work. I examine some misconceptions of locked-down digital work and discuss the implications of locked-down digital work for research and practice.","Richter, Alexander",Int J Inf Manage,,470

The purpose of this article is to describe the impact of clinical nurse specialist practice on COVID-19 preparation at a military hospital. ENVIRONMENT OF CARE CHANGES: The pandemic required facilities to develop expansion plans to facilitate a potential surge of COVID-19 patients. Clinical nurse specialists collaborated to develop a plan to expand care capacity and streamline testing while designating specific critical care and medical-surgical areas for COVID-19 patients. STAFFING CONSIDERATIONS: To capitalize on the expanded bed capacity, clinical nurse specialists identified and trained outpatient nursing staff to serve as nurse extenders. DISCUSSION: Early in the pandemic, a lack of strong evidence-based interventions to mitigate transmission and treatment necessitated the development of innovative solutions. The clinical nurse specialist team established designated transport routes for COVID-19 patients, leveraged technology to improve methods of care, and cultivated a culture of innovation by providing on-the-spot meaningful recognition to staff. CONCLUSION: As leaders in healthcare, clinical nurse specialists are change agents that work to maintain high-quality, safe patient care even during a global pandemic.","Lucciola, Megan E; Nelson, Nicole M; Rea, Jessica M; Boudreaux, Allan J; Fedderson, Daniel J; Hodge, Nancy S",Clin Nurse Spec,,470
416156,COVID-19 threatens decade-long suicide initiatives in Japan,2021,"How amphipathic phospholipids are shuttled between the membrane bilayer remains an essential but elusive process, particularly at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). One prominent phospholipid shuttling process concerns the biogenesis of APOB-containing lipoproteins within the ER lumen, which may require bulk trans-bilayer movement of phospholipids from the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER bilayer. Here, we show that TMEM41B, present in the lipoprotein export machinery, encodes a previously conceptualized ER lipid scramblase mediating trans-bilayer shuttling of bulk phospholipids. Loss of hepatic TMEM41B eliminates plasma lipids, due to complete absence of mature lipoproteins within the ER, but paradoxically also activates lipid production. Mechanistically, scramblase deficiency triggers unique ER morphological changes and unsuppressed activation of SREBPs, which potently promotes lipid synthesis despite stalled secretion. Together, this response induces full-blown nonalcoholic hepatosteatosis in the TMEM41B-deficient mice within weeks. Collectively, our data uncovered a fundamental mechanism safe-guarding ER function and integrity, dysfunction of which disrupts lipid homeostasis.","Huang, Dong; Xu, Bolin; Liu, Lu; Wu, Lingzhi; Zhu, Yuangang; Ghanbarpour, Alireza; Wang, Yawei; Chen, Feng-Jung; Lyu, Jia; Hu, Yating; Kang, Yunlu; Zhou, Wenjing; Wang, Xiao; Ding, Wanqiu; Li, Xin; Jiang, Zhaodi; Chen, Jizheng; Zhang, Xu; Zhou, Hongwen; Li, John Zhong; Guo, Chunguang; Zheng, Wen; Zhang, Xiuqin; Li, Peng; Melia, Thomas; Reinisch, Karin; Chen, Xiao-Wei",Cell metab,,470

In a volatile and uncertain business environment, resilience can be incorporated by developing and implementing effective risk mitigation strategies. In this research, risk mitigation strategies for environmentally sustainable clothing supply chain have been prioritised by considering their efficacy to mitigate various risks. Twelve risks and thirteen mitigation strategies, identified through literature review and expert's opinion, are considered as decision criteria and alternatives respectively. Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (fuzzy TOPSIS) is implemented under a group decision making scenario for prioritising the strategies. Developing supply chain agility;multiple green sourcing and flexible capacities;adoption of green practices;building trust, coordination and collaboration;and alignment of economic incentives and revenue sharing are found to be dominant risk mitigation strategies for environmentally sustainable clothing supply chain. These strategies have been viewed through the lens of resource dependence, change management and transaction cost theories.

417096,"Athlete's Perceptions of a ""Quarantine"" Training Camp During the COVID-19 Lockdown",2020,"By estimating 3D shape and instances from a single view, we can capture information about an environment quickly, without the need for comprehensive scanning and multi-view fusion. Solving this task for composite scenes (such as object stacks) is challenging: occluded areas are not only ambiguous in shape but also in instance segmentation; multiple decompositions could be valid. We observe that physics constrains decomposition as well as shape in occluded regions and hypothesise that a latent space learned from scenes built under physics simulation can serve as a prior to better predict shape and instances in occluded regions. To this end we propose SIMstack, a depth-conditioned Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), trained on a dataset of objects stacked under physics simulation. We formulate instance segmentation as a centre voting task which allows for class-agnostic detection and doesn't require setting the maximum number of objects in the scene. At test time, our model can generate 3D shape and instance segmentation from a single depth view, probabilistically sampling proposals for the occluded region from the learned latent space. Our method has practical applications in providing robots some of the ability humans have to make rapid intuitive inferences of partially observed scenes. We demonstrate an application for precise (non-disruptive) object grasping of unknown objects from a single depth view.","Landgraf, Zoe; Scona, Raluca; Laidlow, Tristan; James, Stephen; Leutenegger, Stefan; Davison, Andrew J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16442v2.pdf,470

The aim of this study was to explore the quality of the online education in China for international medical and nursing students from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) as well as the factors that influenced their satisfaction with online education during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Questionnaires were developed and administered to 316 international medical and nursing students and 120 teachers at a university in China. The Chi-square test was used to detect the influence of participants' personal characteristics on their satisfaction with online education. The Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test was employed to identify the negative and positive factors influencing the online education satisfaction. A binary logistic regression model was performed for multiple-factor analysis to determine the association of the different categories of influential factors-crisis-, learner-, instructor-, and course-related categories, with the online education satisfaction. RESULTS: Overall, 230 students (response rate 72.8%) and 95 teachers (response rate 79.2%) completed the survey. It was found that 36.5% of students and 61.1% of teachers were satisfied with the online education. Teachers' professional title, students' year of study, continent of origin and location of current residence significantly influenced the online education satisfaction. The most influential barrier for students was the severity of the COVID-19 situation and for teachers it was the sense of distance. The most influential facilitating factor for students was a well-accomplished course assignment and for teachers it was the successful administration of the online courses. CONCLUSIONS: Several key factors have been identified that affected the attitudes of international health science students from LMICs and their teachers towards online education in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. To improve the online education outcome, medical schools are advised to promote the facilitating factors and cope with the barriers, by providing support for students and teaching faculties to deal with the anxiety caused by the pandemic, caring for the state of mind of in-China students away from home, maintaining the engagement of out-China students studying from afar and enhancing collaborations with overseas institutions to create practice opportunities at students' local places.","Li, Wen; Gillies, Robyn; He, Mingyu; Wu, Changhao; Liu, Shenjun; Gong, Zheng; Sun, Hong",Hum Resour Health,,470

418921,Perceived stress among university students in south-east Serbia during the COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To describe a national cohort of pregnant women admitted to hospital with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the UK, identify factors associated with infection, and describe outcomes, including transmission of infection, for mothers and infants. DESIGN: Prospective national population based cohort study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS). SETTING: All 194 obstetric units in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 427 pregnant women admitted to hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 March 2020 and 14 April 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of maternal hospital admission and infant infection. Rates of maternal death, level 3 critical care unit admission, fetal loss, caesarean birth, preterm birth, stillbirth, early neonatal death, and neonatal unit admission. RESULTS: The estimated incidence of admission to hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy was 4.9 (95% confidence interval 4.5 to 5.4) per 1000 maternities. 233 (56%) pregnant women admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy were from black or other ethnic minority groups, 281 (69%) were overweight or obese, 175 (41%) were aged 35 or over, and 145 (34%) had pre-existing comorbidities. 266 (62%) women gave birth or had a pregnancy loss; 196 (73%) gave birth at term. Forty one (10%) women admitted to hospital needed respiratory support, and five (1%) women died. Twelve (5%) of 265 infants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, six of them within the first 12 hours after birth. CONCLUSIONS: Most pregnant women admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection were in the late second or third trimester, supporting guidance for continued social distancing measures in later pregnancy. Most had good outcomes, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to infants was uncommon. The high proportion of women from black or minority ethnic groups admitted with infection needs urgent investigation and explanation.

Methods: We retrospectively analysed the epidemiological information, discharge summaries, and laboratory results of 324 patients. Results: In all, 15 (8.62%) patients experienced chest distress/breath shortness, where 8 of the 15 were severely ill. This means severely ill patients need an extended amount of time to recover after discharge; next, 20 (11.49%) patients experienced anxiety and 21 (12.07%) had headache/insomnia and a small fraction of them complained of anosmia/ageusia, indicating that these patients need treatment for mental and psychological health issues. Regarding the re-positive patients, their CT and laboratory test results showed no obvious evidence of illness progress or infectivity but a high anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody expression.

The Department of Health Services, Government of Kerala, initially released daily updates through daily textual bulletins for public awareness to control the spread of the disease. However, these unstructured data limit upstream applications, such as visualization, and analysis, thus demanding refinement to generate open and reusable datasets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through a citizen science initiative, we leveraged publicly available and crowd-verified data on COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala from the government bulletins and media outlets to generate reusable datasets. This was further visualized as a dashboard through a front-end Web application and a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) repository, which serves as an application programming interface for the front end. RESULTS: From the sourced data, we provided real-time analysis, and daily updates of COVID-19 cases in Kerala, through a user-friendly bilingual dashboard (https://covid19kerala.info/) for nonspecialists. To ensure longevity and reusability, the dataset was deposited in an open-access public repository for future analysis. Finally, we provide outbreak trends and demographic characteristics of the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala during the first 138 days of the outbreak. DISCUSSION: We anticipate that our dataset can form the basis for future studies, supplemented with clinical and epidemiological data from the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala.

METHODS: Systematic review of the literature was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar to retrieve original studies on chest CT findings of patients with confirmed COVID-19, available up to 10 May 2020. Data on frequency and distribution of chest CT findings were extracted from eligible studies, pooled and meta-analyzed using random-effects model to calculate the prevalence of chest CT findings. RESULTS: Overall, 103 studies (pooled population: 9907 confirmed COVID-19 patients) were meta-analyzed. The most common CT findings were ground-glass opacities (GGOs) (77.18%, 95%CI = 72.23-81.47), reticulations (46.24%, 95%CI = 38.51-54.14), and air bronchogram (41.61%, 95%CI = 32.78-51.01). Pleural thickening (33.35%, 95%CI = 21.89-47.18) and bronchial wall thickening (15.48%, 95%CI = 8.54-26.43) were major atypical and airway findings. Lesions were predominantly distributed bilaterally (75.72%, 95%CI = 70.79-80.06) and peripherally (65.64%, 95%CI = 58.21-72.36), while 8.20% (95%CI = 6.30-10.61) of patients had no abnormal findings and pre-existing lung diseases were present in 6.01% (95%CI = 4.37-8.23). CONCLUSIONS: The most common CT findings in COVID-19 are GGOs with/without consolidation, reticulations, and air bronchogram, which often involve both lungs with peripheral distribution. However, COVID-19 might present with atypical manifestations or no abnormal findings in chest CT, which deserve clinicians' notice.","Zarifian, Ahmadreza; Ghasemi Nour, Mohammad; Akhavan Rezayat, Arash; Rahimzadeh Oskooei, Reza; Abbasi, Bita; Sadeghi, Ramin",Clin Imaging,,470

As for now, there is an urgent need to develop novel drugs or vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. METHODS: Polyphenolic compounds have potential as drug candidates for various diseases, including viral infections. In this study, polyphenolic compounds contained in Geranii Herba were chosen for an in silico approach. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), 3CLpro (Replicase polyprotein 1ab), and the cell surface receptor glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) were chosen as target proteins. RESULTS: Based on the molecular docking analysis, ellagic acid, gallic acid, geraniin, kaempferitrin, kaempferol, and quercetin showed significant binding interactions with the target proteins. Besides, the molecular dynamic simulation studies support Geranii Herba's inhibition efficiency on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We assume that the active compounds in Geranii Herba might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 cell entry through the ACE2 receptor and inhibit the proteolytic process. Besides, these compounds may help to regulate the cell signaling under the unfolded protein response in endoplasmic reticulum stress through the binding with GRP78 and avoid the SARS-CoV-2 interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, the compounds present in Geranii Herba could be used as possible drug candidates for the prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Arokiyaraj, Selvaraj; Stalin, Antony; Kannan, Balakrishnan Senthamarai; Shin, Hakdong",,,470
421380,Exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric surgical services: a scoping review,2021,"Test anxiety caused by intolerance of uncertainty has a negative impact on the physical and mental health of student athletes, especially in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 556 grade three high school student athletes in Chongqing, China, were investigated using the Test Anxiety Scale (TAS), Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12 (IUS-12), Perceived Social Support Scale, and Coping Style Scale for Middle School Students. Results reveal that more than half the student athletes experienced test anxiety, and the severity was above average during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a significant correlation between intolerance of uncertainty, perceived social support, coping style, and test anxiety. A positive correlation was found between test anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and coping style toward emotions, and a negative correlation between test anxiety, perceived social support, and coping style toward problems. Intolerance of uncertainty has a direct predictive effect on test anxiety, and perceived social support and coping style play a chain mediator role between intolerance of uncertainty and test anxiety. By constructing the mediating effect model, we can, to some extent, reveal the mechanism of the influence of intolerance of uncertainty on test anxiety. This study has a certain reference value for the prevention of test anxiety in student athletes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, G.; Zhou, J.; Yang, G.; Li, B.; Deng, Q.; Guo, L.",Frontiers in Psychology,,470

421567,Anxiety Sensitivity Moderates the Impact of COVID-19 Perceived Stress on Anxiety and Functional Impairment,2021,"Distinct mammalian RNA viruses trigger Dicer-mediated production of virus-derived small-interfering RNAs (vsiRNA) and encode unrelated proteins to suppress vsiRNA biogenesis. However, the mechanism and function of the mammalian RNA interference (RNAi) response are poorly understood. Here, we characterized antiviral RNAi in a mouse model of infection with Nodamura virus (NoV), a mosquito-transmissible positive-strand RNA virus encoding a known double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding viral suppressor of RNAi (VSR), the B2 protein. We show that inhibition of NoV RNA replication by antiviral RNAi in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) requires Dicer-dependent vsiRNA biogenesis and Argonaute-2 slicer activity. We found that VSR-B2 of NoV enhances viral RNA replication in wild-type but not RNAi-defective MEFs such as Argonaute-2 catalytic-dead MEFs and Dicer or Argonaute-2 knockout MEFs, indicating that VSR-B2 acts mainly by suppressing antiviral RNAi in the differentiated murine cells. Consistently, VSR-B2 expression in MEFs has no detectable effect on the induction of interferon-stimulated genes or the activation of global RNA cleavages by RNase L. Moreover, we demonstrate that NoV infection of adult mice induces production of abundant vsiRNA active to guide RNA slicing by Argonaute-2. Notably, VSR-B2 suppresses the biogenesis of both vsiRNA and the slicing-competent vsiRNA-Argonaute-2 complex without detectable inhibition of Argonaute-2 slicing guided by endogenous microRNA, which dramatically enhances viral load and promotes lethal NoV infection in adult mice either intact or defective in the signaling by type I, II, and III interferons. Together, our findings suggest that the mouse RNAi response confers essential protective antiviral immunity in both the presence and absence of the interferon response.IMPORTANCE Innate immune sensing of viral nucleic acids in mammals triggers potent antiviral responses regulated by interferons known to antagonize the induction of RNA interference (RNAi) by synthetic long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Here, we show that Nodamura virus (NoV) infection in adult mice activates processing of the viral dsRNA replicative intermediates into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) active to guide RNA slicing by Argonaute-2. Genetic studies demonstrate that NoV RNA replication in mouse embryonic fibroblasts is inhibited by the RNAi pathway and enhanced by the B2 viral RNAi suppressor only in RNAi-competent cells. When B2 is rendered nonexpressing or nonfunctional, the resulting mutant viruses become nonpathogenic and are cleared in adult mice either intact or defective in the signaling by type I, II, and III interferons. Our findings suggest that mouse antiviral RNAi is active and necessary for the in vivo defense against viral infection in both the presence and absence of the interferon response.","Han, Qingxia; Chen, Gang; Wang, Jinyan; Jee, David; Li, Wan-Xiang; Lai, Eric C; Ding, Shou-Wei",mBio (Online),,470

Here, we have utilized an in silico molecular docking approach to identify the possible inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease, by screening 21 antiviral, antifungal and anticancer compounds. Among them, Neobavaisoflavone has the highest binding energy for SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease.

A cross-sectional study was conducted among registered Lebanese radiographers to assess the general, workplace conditions, health and safety, mental/psychologic, financial, and skill/knowledge development impacts. Despite applying an adapted safety protocol, institutions are neither providing free RT-PCR testing to their staff nor showing adequate support for infected staff members, thus causing distress about contracting the virus from the workplace.

Although the genetic sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have high homology, the clinical and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 differ significantly from those of SARS. How and whether SARS-CoV-2 evades (cellular) immune surveillance requires further elucidation. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to major histocompability complex class &#921; (MHC-&#921;) down-regulation both in vitro and in vivo. The viral protein encoded by open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2, which shares the least homology with SARS-CoV among all viral proteins, directly interacts with MHC-&#921; molecules and mediates their down-regulation. In ORF8-expressing cells, MHC-&#921; molecules are selectively targeted for lysosomal degradation via autophagy. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells are much less sensitive to lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Because ORF8 protein impairs the antigen presentation system, inhibition of ORF8 could be a strategy to improve immune surveillance.","Zhang, Yiwen; Chen, Yingshi; Li, Yuzhuang; Huang, Feng; Luo, Baohong; Yuan, Yaochang; Xia, Baijin; Ma, Xiancai; Yang, Tao; Yu, Fei; Liu, Jun; Liu, Bingfeng; Song, Zheng; Chen, Jingliang; Yan, Shumei; Wu, Liyang; Pan, Ting; Zhang, Xu; Li, Rong; Huang, Wenjing; He, Xin; Xiao, Fei; Zhang, Junsong; Zhang, Hui",Proc.

Our aim was to provide a comprehensive account of all hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in England during the early phase of the pandemic and to identify the factors that influenced mortality as the pandemic evolved. METHODS: This was a retrospective exploratory analysis using the Hospital Episode Statistics administrative dataset. All patients aged 18 years or older in England who completed a hospital stay (were discharged alive or died) between March 1 and May 31, 2020, and had a diagnosis of COVID-19 on admission or during their stay were included. In-hospital death was the primary outcome of interest. Multilevel logistic regression was used to model the relationship between death and several covariates: age, sex, deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation), ethnicity, frailty (Hospital Frailty Risk Score), presence of comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index items), and date of discharge (whether alive or deceased). FINDINGS: 91â541 adult patients with COVID-19 were discharged during the study period, among which 28â200 (30·8%) in-hospital deaths occurred. The final multilevel logistic regression model accounted for age, deprivation score, and date of discharge as continuous variables, and sex, ethnicity, and Charlson Comorbidity Index items as categorical variables. In this model, significant predictors of in-hospital death included older age (modelled using restricted cubic splines), male sex (1·457 [1·408-1·509]), greater deprivation (1·002 [1·001-1·003]), Asian (1·211 [1·128-1·299]) or mixed ethnicity (1·317 [1·080-1·605]; vs White ethnicity), and most of the assessed comorbidities, including moderate or severe liver disease (5·433 [4·618-6·392]). Later date of discharge was associated with a lower odds of death (0·977 [0·976-0·978]); adjusted in-hospital mortality improved significantly in a broadly linear fashion, from 52·2% in the first week of March to 16·8% in the last week of May. INTERPRETATION: Reductions in the adjusted probability of in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients over time might reflect the impact of changes in hospital strategy and clinical processes. The reasons for the observed improvements in mortality should be thoroughly investigated to inform the response to future outbreaks. The higher mortality rate reported for certain ethnic minority groups in community-based studies compared with our hospital-based analysis might partly reflect differential infection rates in those at greatest risk, propensity to become severely ill once infected, and health-seeking behaviours.

Methods: 60 rats, divided into six groups of 10 animals, were utilized. In the sham group, laparotomy, abdominal organ manipulation, and suture of the wall were performed; the two pneumoperitoneum groups were submitted to pneumoperitoneum for one and three hours, respectively. In the colitis group, colitis was induced, laparotomy, abdominal organ manipulation and suture of the wall were performed. In the two colitis pneumoperitoneum groups colitis was induced plus pneumoperitoneum for one and three hours, respectively. After the animals were sacrificed, kidneys, spleens, livers, and mesenteric lymph nodes were collected. In the animals submitted to induced colitis, 2 cm of colon were resected for histologic analysis. The resected organs were analyzed for the presence of E. coli and Enterococcus faecallis in order to check bacterial translocation. Results: No statistic difference was found in the groups submitted to colitis. The bacterial translocation is no dependent on the genus of bacteria. There is no increase in bacterial translocation due to the duration of pneumoperitoneum (one and three hours) either in normal rats or in those submitted to induced colitis. Conclusion: Pneumoperitoneum induces bacterial translocation in normal rats and increases it in rats submitted to induced colitis.","Hajar, Nemer; Carlos Domingues Repka, João; Wilson Canan Júnior, Lady",Acta cir. bras.,,470

This was a single-center observational study, recruiting all consecutive adults with COVID-19. The elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to the highest level between COVID-19 diagnosis and hospital discharge was categorized according to a standardized toxicity grade scale. In total, 799 patients were included in this study, 39% of which were female, with a mean age of 69.9 (±16.0) years. Of these patients, 225 (28.1%) developed LEE of grade &#8805;2 after a median of three days (interquartile range (IQR): 0-8 days) from the diagnosis of COVID-19, and they were estimated to have a higher hazard of death or ICU admission (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-1.88). The clinical and laboratory variables associated with the development of LEE were male sex, higher respiratory rate, higher gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and lower albumin levels at baseline. Among the analyzed treatments, steroids, tocilizumab and darunavir/ritonavir correlated with LEE. In conclusion, LEE were associated with mortality and ICU admission among COVID-19 patients. While the origin of LEE is probably multifactorial, LEE evaluation could add information to the clinical and laboratory variables that are commonly evaluated during the course of COVID-19.","Taramasso, Lucia; Vena, Antonio; Bovis, Francesca; Portunato, Federica; Mora, Sara; Dentone, Chiara; Delfino, Emanuele; Mikulska, Malgorzata; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; De Maria, Andrea; Magnasco, Laura; Giacomini, Mauro; Di Biagio, Antonio; Bassetti, Matteo",,,470

423787,Prevention older adults fall risk with Kunte program during COVID-19 confinement,2021,"Since the modified CHA2DS2VASC (M-CHA2DS2VASc) risk score includes the prognostic risk factors for COVID-19; we assumed that it might predict in-hospital mortality and identify high-risk patients at an earlier stage compared with troponin increase and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). We aimed to investigate whether M-CHA2DS2VASC RS is an independent predictor of mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and to compare its discriminative ability with troponin increase and NLR in terms of predicting mortality. A total of 694 patients were retrospectively analyzed and divided into 3 groups according to M-CHA2DS2VASC RS which was simply created by changing gender criteria of the CHA2DS2VASC RS from female to male (Group 1, score 0-1 (nâ¯=â¯289); group 2, score 2-3 (nâ¯=â¯231) and group 3, score &#8805;4 (nâ¯=â¯174)). Adverse clinical events were defined as in-hospital mortality, admission to intensive care unit, need for high-flow oxygen and/or intubation. As the M-CHA2DS2VASC RS increased, adverse clinical outcomes were also significantly increased (Group 1, 3.8%; group 2, 12.6%; group 3, 20.8%; p <0.001 for in-hospital mortality). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that M-CHA2DS2VASC RS, troponin increase and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality (pâ¯=â¯0.005, odds ratio 1.29 per scale for M-CHA2DS2VASC RS). In receiver operating characteristic analysis, comparative discriminative ability of M-CHA2DS2VASC RS was superior to CHA2DS2VASC RS score. Area under the curve (AUC) values for in-hospital mortality was 0.70 and 0.64, respectively. (AUCM-CHA2DS2-VASc vs. AUCCHA2DS2-VASc z testâ¯=â¯3.56, p 0.0004) In conclusion, admission M-CHA2DS2VASc RS may be a useful tool to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Cetinkal, Gokhan; Kocas, Betul Balaban; Ser, Ozgur Selim; Kilci, Hakan; Keskin, Kudret; Ozcan, Safiye Nur; Verdi, Yildiz; Zeren, Mustafa Ismet; Demir, Tolga; Kilickesmez, Kadriye",Am J Cardiol,,470

It became a sever health and socio-economic problem, while the world has no vaccine to combat this virus. This research aims to analyze the connection between the fast spread of COVID-19 and regional climate parameters over a global scale. In this research, we collected the data of COVID-19 cases from the time of 1st reported case to the 5th June 2020 in different affected countries and regional climatic parameters data from January 2020 to 5th June 2020. It was found that most of the countries located in the relatively lower temperature region show a rapid increase in the COVID-19 cases than the countries locating in the warmer climatic regions despite their better socio-economic conditions. A correlation between metrological parameters and COVID-19 cases was observed. Average daylight hours are correlated to total the COVID-19 cases with a coefficient of determination of 0.42, while average high-temperature shows a correlation of 0.59 and 0.42 with total COVID-19 cases and death cases respectively. The finding of the study will help international health organizations and local administrations to combat and well manage the spread of COVID-19.","Iqbal, Muhammad Mazhar; Abid, Irfan; Hussain, Saddam; Shahzad, Naeem; Waqas, Muhammad Sohail; Iqbal, Muhammad Jawed",Sci Total Environ,,470

However, little is known about how well these unprecedented measures are being observed as the pandemic evolves. We conducted a six-month online survey to assess the preventive behaviour of Cameroonian adults during the COVID-19 outbreak. A five-point adherence score was constructed based on self-reported observance of the following preventive measures: physical distancing, face mask use, hand hygiene, not touching one's face, and covering the mouth when coughing or sneezing. Predictors of adherence were investigated using ordinal logistic regression models. Of the 7381 responses received from all ten regions, 73.3% were from male respondents and overall mean age was 32.8 ± 10.8 years. Overall mean adherence score was 3.96 ± 1.11 on a scale of 0-5. Mean weekly adherence scores were initially high, but gradually decreased over time accompanied by increasing incidence of COVID-19 during the last study weeks. Predictors for higher adherence included higher age, receiving COVID-19 information from health personnel, and agreeing with the necessity of lockdown measures. Meanwhile, experiencing flu-like symptoms was associated with poor adherence. Continuous observance of preventive measures should be encouraged among Cameroonians in the medium- to long-term to avoid a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.","Siewe Fodjo, Joseph Nelson; Ngarka, Leonard; Njamnshi, Wepnyu Y; Nfor, Leonard N; Mengnjo, Michel K; Mendo, Edwige L; Angwafor, Samuel A; Basseguin, Jonas Guy Atchou; Nkouonlack, Cyrille; Njit, Edith N; Ahidjo, Nene; Chokote, Eric Samuel; Dema, Fidèle; Fonsah, Julius Y; Tatah, Godwin Y; Palmer, Nancy; Seke Etet, Paul F; Palmer, Dennis; Nsagha, Dickson S; Etya039,; ale, Daniel E; Perrig, Stephen; Sztajzel, Roman; Annoni, Jean-Marie; Bissek, Anne-Cécile Zoung-Kanyi; Leke, Rose G F; Obama, Marie-Thérèse Abena Ondoa; Nkengasong, John N; Colebunders, Robert; Njamnshi, Alfred K",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,470

426850,Security Effects and Geopolitical Trends Generated by the Covid-19 Pandemic in the Middle East,2020,"INTRODUCTION: We are currently in the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Research into previous infectious disease outbreaks has shown that healthcare workers are at increased risk for burnout during these dire times, with those on the front lines at greatest risk. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the wellness of emergency physicians (EP). METHODS: A survey was sent to 137 EPs in a multi-hospital network in eastern Pennsylvania. We compared 10 primary and two supplemental questions based on how the physicians had been feeling in the prior 2-3 weeks (COVID-19 period) to the same questions based on how they were feeling in the prior 4-6 months (pre-COVID-19 period). RESULTS: We received 55 responses to the survey (40.1% response rate). The study found that during the pandemic, EPs felt less in control (p-value = 0.001); felt decreased happiness while at work (p-value 0.001); had more trouble falling asleep (p-value = 0.001); had an increased sense of dread when thinking of work needing to be done (p-value = 0.04); felt more stress on days not at work (p-value <0.0001); and were more concerned about their own health (p-value <0.0001) and the health of their families and loved ones (p-value <0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study showed a statistically significant decrease in EP wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared to the pre-pandemic period. We need to be aware of evidence-based recommendations to help mitigate the risks and prevent physician burnout.","Fitzpatrick, Kevin; Patterson, Rachel; Morley, Krista; Stoltzfus, Jill; Stankewicz, Holly",West J Emerg Med,,470

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the practice of preventive measures against COVID-19 differs by one's level of trust in government. DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis using the Japan COVID-19 and Society Internet Survey (JACSIS) conducted in August and September 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A nationally representative sample of Japanese individuals aged 15 through 79 years. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was the composite score for COVID-19 preventive measures, defined as the percentage of preventive measures an individual reported to be practicing (out of nine measures: social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding closed spaces, avoiding crowded spaces, avoiding close contact settings, hand washing, avoiding touching one's face, respiratory hygiene, and surface disinfection). The secondary outcomes were (1) support for stay-at-home requests, (2) use of a contact-tracing app, and (3) receipt of the influenza vaccine in the previous season. KEY RESULTS: Our analysis included a total of 25,482 individuals. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that individuals with high trust in government were likely to practice preventive measures more frequently compared to those with low trust (adjusted composite scores, 83.8% for high- vs. 79.5% for low-trust individuals; adjusted difference, +4.3 percentage points [pp]; 95% CI, +2.4 to +6.2pp; P<0.001). We also found that high trust in government was associated with higher likelihoods of support for stay-at-home requests, use of a contact-tracing app, and receipt of the influenza vaccine in the previous season. CONCLUSIONS: High trust in government was associated with a higher intensity of practicing COVID-19 preventive measures among Japanese individuals at the national level. Our findings may provide useful information to develop and design effective public health interventions.","Gotanda, Hiroshi; Miyawaki, Atsushi; Tabuchi, Takahiro; Tsugawa, Yusuke",J. gen. intern. med,,470

One technology recommended by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization for lowering indoor concentration of these and other microorganisms and viruses is upper-room ultraviolet 254 nm (UVC254 ) systems. Applying both a material balance as well as some nondimensional parameters developed by Rudnick and First, the impact of several critical parameters and their effect on the fraction of microorganisms surviving UVC254 exposure was evaluated. Vertical airspeed showed a large impact at velocities <0.05 m s-1 but a lesser effect at velocities >0.05 m s-1 . In addition, the efficacy of any upper-room UVC system is influenced greatly by the mean room fluence rate as opposed to a simple volume- or area-based dosing criteria. An alternative UVC254 dosing strategy was developed based on the fluence rate as a function of the UVC254 luminaire output (W) and the square root of the product of the room volume and the ceiling height.","Jensen, Paul Arthur",Photochem Photobiol,,470

Sentences represented using those features are then clustered, following which the key sentences are identified through proximity scoring. We also curate a new dataset with sentence level disinformation scorings to aid evaluation for this task; the dataset is being made publicly available to facilitate further research. Based on a comprehensive empirical evaluation against techniques from related tasks such as claim detection and summarization, as well as against simplified variants of our proposed approach, we illustrate that our method is able to identify core disinformation effectively.","Ghosal, Soumya Suvra; Deepak, P; Jurek-Loughrey, Anna",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10836v1.pdf,470

HuaShi XuanFei Formula (HSXFF) was developed to treat patients with mild and general COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province, China. The present study seeks to explore its potentially active compounds and pharmacological mechanisms against COVID-19 based on network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. All components of HSXFF were harvested from the pharmacology database of the TCMSP system. COVID-19-related targets were retrieved from using OMIM and GeneCards databases. The herb-compound-targets network was constructed by Cytoscape. The target protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were performed to discover the potential key target genes and mechanism. The main active compounds of HSXFF were docked with 3C-like (3CL) protease hydrolase and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The MD simulation confirmed the binding stability of docking results. The herbs-targets network mainly contained 52 compounds and 70 corresponding targets, including key targets such as RELA, TNF, TP53, IL6, MAPK1, CXCL8, IL-1ß, and MAPK14. The GO and KEGG indicated that HSXFF may be mainly acting on the IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, NF-&#954;B signaling pathway, etc. The molecular docking results indicated that isovitexin and procyanidin B1 showed the highest affinity with 3CL and ACE2, respectively, which were confirmed by MD simulation. These findings suggested HSXFF exerted therapeutic effects involving ""multi-compounds and multi-targets."" It might be working through directly inhibiting the virus, improving immune function, and reducing the inflammatory in response to anti-COVID-19. In summary, the present study would provide a valuable direction for further research of HSXFF.","Wang, Juan; Ge, Wen; Peng, Xin; Yuan, Lixia; He, Shuaibing; Fu, Xuyan",Mol. divers,,470

Coronaviruses have produced two pandemics and one epidemic in the last two decades. The current pandemic has created a worldwide catastrophe threatening the lives of over 15 million as of July 2020. Current research efforts have been focused on producing a vaccine or repurposing current drug compounds to develop a therapeutic. There is, however, a need to study the active site preferences of relevant targets, such as the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro), to determine ways to optimize these drug compounds. The ensemble docking and characterization work described in this article demonstrates the multifaceted features of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site, molecular guidelines to improving binding affinity, and ultimately the optimization of drug candidates. A total of 220 compounds were docked into both the 5R7Z and 6LU7 SARS-CoV-2 Mpro crystal structures. Several key preferences for strong binding to the four subsites (S1, S1', S2, and S4) were identified, such as accessing hydrogen binding hotspots, hydrophobic patches, and utilization of primarily aliphatic instead of aromatic substituents. After optimization efforts using the design guidelines developed from the molecular docking studies, the average docking score of the parent compounds was improved by 6.59 -log10(Kd) in binding affinity which represents an increase of greater than six orders of magnitude. Using the optimization guidelines, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor cinanserin was optimized resulting in an increase in binding affinity of 4.59 -log10(Kd) and increased protease inhibitor bioactivity. The results of molecular dynamic (MD) simulation of cinanserin-optimized compounds CM02, CM06, and CM07 revealed that CM02 and CM06 fit well into the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession number 6LU7] and formed strong and stable interactions with the key residues, Ser-144, His-163, and Glu-166. The enhanced binding affinity produced demonstrates the utility of the design guidelines described. The work described herein will assist scientists in developing potent COVID-19 antivirals.","Stoddard, Shana V; Stoddard, Serena D; Oelkers, Benjamin K; Fitts, Kennedi; Whalum, Kellen; Whalum, Kaylah; Hemphill, Alexander D; Manikonda, Jithin; Martinez, Linda Michelle; Riley, Elizabeth G; Roof, Caroline M; Sarwar, Nowreen; Thomas, Doni M; Ulmer, Emily; Wallace, Felissa E; Pandey, Pankaj; Roy, Sudeshna",Viruses,,470

Results showed that students' main functional difficulties in both countries were: worries about their family health status and their learning assignments. In both countries, COVID-related functional difficulties and stress associated with exposure to the media added a significant amount of the explained variance of COVID-related concerns after controlling for background variables. In conclusion-while the level of exposure and difficulties may differ by country and context, their associations with students' concerns seem robust.

435410,Progression of mental health issues during covid-19,2020,"In the USA, numerous summer programs are available for undergraduate students that seek to increase the number of individuals from groups underrepresented in medicine (URM) that matriculate to medical school. These programs have typically been conducted at research-focused institutions, involving hands-on-research and various enrichment experiences. For 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the suspension of on-campus student activities at American universities, necessitating a switch to a virtual format for these URM-focused programs. Outcomes, however, from these programs conducted virtually, necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have not been reported. The Penn Access Summer Scholars (PASS) program at the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) targets URM undergraduates, providing two consecutive summers of mentored research and enrichment experiences, with the goal of enabling participants' matriculation to PSOM. PASS has been an 8 week on-campus experience, but during summer 2020, virtual programming of 6 weeks was provided due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in the 2020 virtual offering of PASS completed pre- and post-program surveys that included 5-point Likert-style and open-ended questions to determine the impact of the programing on self-assessments of research skills, familiarity with the physician identity, and preparedness to be a PSOM student. Post-program, participants also assessed program administration and content. With respect to program objectives, participants reported significant increases in their self-reported confidence in conducting research, understanding of physician identity, and sense of preparedness for medical school. The educational value of the program content, their level of engagement in the program and the overall quality of the program were rated as excellent or outstanding by large majorities of respondents. Content analyses of participant comments were consistent with these quantitative results. Therefore, a premedical summer enrichment program targeting URM undergraduates can be successfully conducted virtually to achieve program objectives and may increase the availability to these initiatives.","Zhou, Cecilia; Okafor, Chielozor; Hagood, Jamal; DeLisser, Horace M",Med Educ Online,,470

OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the most common reasons for patient presentations in the VC, the proportion of re-presentations in the practice despite VC, practical challenges associated with the introduction of VC and patient satisfaction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with a recent acute visual deterioration and severe eye pain were excluded from the VC. The VC were carried out by a trained specialist in ophthalmology. A questionnaire with eight questions was completed after the VC appointment in order to evaluate the proportion of completed VC and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: We included 29 (13 male, Ø 52.6 years, 16 female, Ø 64.7 years) patients in this analysis. The VC could be performed with 68.97% of the participants who rated their overall experience with an average grade of 1.6 (1 very good to 6 insufficient) and all of them indicated that they would recommend the VC. Of presentations in VC 70% were related to the symptoms of the anterior eye segment. In 70% of the cases no re-presentations took place in the unit.

A shorter quarantine might improve compliance, and CDC recommends two options to reduce the duration of quarantine for close contacts without symptoms, based on local circumstances and availability of testing: 1) quarantine can end on day 10 without a test or 2) quarantine can end on day 7 after receiving a negative test result. However, shorter quarantine might permit ongoing disease transmission from persons who develop symptoms or become infectious near the end of the recommended 14-day period. Interim data from an ongoing study of household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed to understand the proportion of household contacts that had detectable virus after a shortened quarantine period. Persons who were household contacts of index patients completed a daily symptom diary and self-collected respiratory specimens for 14 days. Specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Among 185 household contacts enrolled, 109 (59%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 at any time; 76% (83/109) of test results were positive within 7 days, and 86% (94 of 109) were positive within 10 days after the index patient's illness onset date. Among household contacts who received negative SARS-CoV-2 test results and were asymptomatic through day 7, there was an 81% chance (95% confidence interval [CI] = 67%-90%) of remaining asymptomatic and receiving negative RT-PCR test results through day 14; this increased to 93% (95% CI = 78%-98%) for household members who were asymptomatic with negative RT-PCR test results through day 10. Although SARS-CoV-2 quarantine periods shorter than 14 days might be easier to adhere to, there is a potential for onward transmission from household contacts released before day 14.","Rolfes, Melissa A; Grijalva, Carlos G; Zhu, Yuwei; McLean, Huong Q; Hanson, Kayla E; Belongia, Edward A; Halasa, Natasha B; Kim, Ahra; Meece, Jennifer; Reed, Carrie; Talbot, H Keipp; Fry, Alicia M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,470

We aimed to quantify the associations between socio-economic status and COVID-19-related cases and mortality in the U.S. STUDY DESIGN: The study design includes nationwide COVID-19 data at the county level that were paired with the Distressed Communities Index (DCI) and its component metrics of socio-economic status. METHODS: Severely distressed communities were classified by DCI>75 for univariate analyses. Adjusted rate ratios were calculated for cases and fatalities per 100,000 persons using hierarchical linear mixed models. RESULTS: This cohort included 1,089,999 cases and 62,298 deaths in 3127 counties for a case fatality rate of 5.7%. Severely distressed counties had significantly fewer deaths from COVID-19 but higher number of deaths per 100,000 persons. In risk-adjusted analysis, the two socio-economic determinants of health with the strongest association with both higher cases per 100,000 persons and higher fatalities per 100,000 persons were the percentage of adults without a high school degree (cases: RR 1.10; fatalities: RR 1.08) and proportion of black residents (cases and fatalities: Relative risk(RR) 1.03). The percentage of the population aged older than 65 years was also highly predictive for fatalities per 100,000 persons (RR 1.07). CONCLUSION: Lower education levels and greater percentages of black residents are strongly associated with higher rates of both COVID-19 cases and fatalities. Socio-economic factors should be considered when implementing public health interventions to ameliorate the disparities in the impact of COVID-19 on distressed communities.","Hawkins, R B; Charles, E J; Mehaffey, J H",Public Health,,470

437391,Correction to: Psychological experience and coping strategies of patients in the Northeast US delaying care for infertility during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus (designated as SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic worldwide. Based on the current reports, hypertension may be associated with increased risk of sever condition in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was recently identified to functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2. Previous experimental data revealed ACE2 level was increased following treatment with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Currently doctors concern whether these commonly used renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers-ACEIs/ARBs may increase the severity of COVID-19. Methods: We extracted data regarding 50 hospitalized hypertension patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Feb 7 to Mar 03, 2020. These patients were grouped into RAS blockers group (Group A, n=20) and non-RAS blockers group (Group B, n=30) according to the basic blood pressure medications. All patients continued to use pre-admission antihypertensive drugs. Clinical severity (symptoms, laboratory and chest CT findings, etc.), clinical course, and short time outcome were analyzed after hospital admission. Results: Ten (50%) and seventeen (56.7%) of the Group A and Group B participants were males (P=0.643), and the average age was 52.65±13.12 and 67.77±12.84 years (P=0.000), respectively. The blood pressure of both groups was under effective control. There was no significant difference in clinical severity, clinical course and in-hospital mortality between Group A and Group B. Serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) (P=0.03), and N-terminal (NT)-pro hormone BNP (NT-proBNP) (P=0.04) showed significant lower level in Group A than in Group B. But the patients with more than 0.04ng/mL or elevated NT-proBNP level had no statistical significance between the two groups. In patients over 65 years or under 65 years, cTnI or NT-proBNP level showed no difference between the two groups. Conclusions: We observed there was no obvious difference in clinical characteristics between RAS blockers and non-RAS blockers groups. These data suggest ACEIs/ARBs may have few effects on increasing the clinical severe conditions of COVID-19.","Huang, Zheyong; Cao, Jiatian; Yao, Yumeng; Jin, Xuejuan; Luo, Zhe; Xue, Yuan; Zhu, Chouwen; Song, Yanan; Wang, Ying; Zou, Yunzeng; Qian, Juying; Yu, Kaihuan; Gong, Hui; Ge, Junbo",Ann.

Despite the challenges, ISPRS is organizing its second consecutive virtual Congress to motivate, inspire and connect geospatial researchers around the globe to share the knowledge and communicate their research results. This year Commission IV shares the successful research endeavours of many members of working groups and their graduate students and research teams.In the years since the XXIII ISPRS congress, 2016, there have been many important developments. Managing the social and economic challenges brought by increased complexity and interconnectivity of activities in human society requires new dimensions of analysing information and specifically spatial information. The increased pressure on the usage of geographic space, maintaining sustainable development and creating liveable community environments increases the requirements for spatial decision-making tools. The last years of Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns pose a range of new challenges to spatial information such as occupancy estimations, efficient use of building space and safe navigation within buildings. The focus on dynamic changes and analysing real-time sensor data is increasing. The developments of Spatial Digital Twins are maturing in the context of providing tools and methods for high density human settlements to be more resilient, sustainable, liveable, and safe.Commission IV Spatial Information Science (2016–2022) is dedicated to advance research activities in spatial information sciences for modelling, structuring, management, analysis, visualization and simulation of (big) data with focus on the third spatial dimension and taking into consideration dynamic changes. Special attention is given to linking information about real-world physical phenomena with societal, governmental, organizational and legal information in order to address the complexity of issues in their entirety. The Commission has contributed to advancements in data modelling, data fusion and management, visualization (web-based, VR and AR), simulation and city analytics, and 3D applications. The work had largely been implemented in cooperation with international organizations such as FIG, UDMS, 3DGeoinfo, ICA, OGC, ISO and Web3D.The Commission consists of 10 scientific areas of research that is coordinated by 10 working groups (WG) and one inter commission working group (ICWG) as follows – WG1: Multidimensional spatial models;WG2: Ontologies, semantics and knowledge representation for geospatial information;WG3: Spatial data analysis, statistic and uncertainty modelling;WG4: Collaborative crowdsourced cloud mapping (C3M);WG5: Indoor/outdoor seamless modelling, LBS and mobility;WG6: SDI: Internet of things and spatial decision support;WG7: Geo-data management;WG8: Geo-computation and geo-simulation;WG9: Geovisualisation, augmented and virtual reality;WG10: Advanced geospatial applications for smart cities and regions;ICWG IV/III: Global mapping: updating, verification and interoperability.The papers received for the ISPRS virtual event reflect the above-mentioned scientific research areas. The reported research ranges from advancements in new and emerging theories, through experiments and analysis to demonstration of technologies in different applications. The research was captured through papers and abstracts published in the collection of ISPRS Annals and ISPRS Archives. The ISPRS Annals contain 24 papers and the ISPRS Archives contain 56 papers. The diversity of the research presented in the published papers clearly indicates the wide range of topics within the field of Spatial Information Science. A rigorous peer-review process by the ISPRS TC IV Scientific Committee contributed to high quality proceedings.In closing we would like to note the commission’s plans for the upcoming year. Because the pandemic has forced many to work remotely, we have been motivated to find new ways to remain informed of changes in the work of the commission and working gr ups. The commission plans to host monthly webinars at which working groups can showcase their activities and achievements. We hope that this will generate greater interest in the work of the commission and enhance the profile of the commission’s working groups.","Zlatanova, S.; Dragicevic, S.; Sithole, G.","ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences",,470

439776,The 5-factor model of psychological response to COVID-19: its correlation with anxiety and depression,2021,"SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease COVID-19, generally has a mild disease course in children. However, a severe post-infectious inflammatory process known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children has been observed in association with COVID-19. This inflammatory process is a result of an abnormal immune response with similar clinical features to Kawasaki disease. It is well established that multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is associated with myocardial dysfunction, coronary artery dilation or aneurysms, and occasionally arrhythmias. The most common electrocardiographic abnormalities seen include premature atrial or ventricular ectopy, variable degrees of atrioventricular block, and QTc prolongation, and rarely, haemodynamically significant arrhythmias necessitating extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. However, presentation with fever, hypotension, and relative bradycardia with a left axis idioventricular rhythm has not been previously reported. We present a case of a young adolescent with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children with myocarditis and a profoundly inappropriate sinus node response to shock with complete resolution following intravenous immunoglobulin.","Tomlinson, Lesya G; Cohen, Mitchell I; Levorson, Rebecca E; Tzeng, Megan B",Cardiol Young,,470

Currently, treatments are limited, and there is no approved vaccine. Interventions such as handwashing, masks, social distancing, and ""social bubbles"" are used to limit community transmission, but it is challenging to choose the best interventions for a given activity. Here, we provide a quantitative framework to determine which interventions are likely to have the most impact in which settings. We introduce the concept of ""event R,"" the expected number of new infections due to the presence of a single infectious individual at an event. We obtain a fundamental relationship between event R and four parameters: transmission intensity, duration of exposure, the proximity of individuals, and the degree of mixing. We use reports of small outbreaks to establish event R and transmission intensity in a range of settings. We identify principles that guide whether physical distancing, masks and other barriers to transmission, or social bubbles will be most effective. We outline how this information can be obtained and used to reopen economies with principled measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission.","Tupper, Paul; Boury, Himani; Yerlanov, Madi; Colijn, Caroline",Proc.

NAD+ is an essential coenzyme that plays important roles in various metabolic pathways and increasing its overall content has been confirmed as a valuable strategy for treating a wide variety of pathophysiological conditions. Accumulating evidence on NRs' health benefits has validated its efficiency across numerous animal and human studies for the treatment of a number of cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and metabolic disorders. As the prevalence and morbidity of these conditions increases in modern society, the great necessity has arisen for a rapid translation of NR to therapeutic use and further establishment of its availability as a nutritional supplement. Here, we summarize currently available data on NR effects on metabolism, and several neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disorders, through to its application as a treatment for specific pathophysiological conditions. In addition, we have reviewed newly published research on the application of NR as a potential therapy against infections with several pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, to support rapid NR translation to therapeutics, the challenges related to its bioavailability and safety are addressed, together with the advantages of NR to other NAD+ precursors.","Mehmel, Mario; Jovanovic, Nina; Spitz, Urs",Nutrients,,470

Fighting this infodemic has been declared one of the most important focus areas of the World Health Organization, with dangers ranging from promoting fake cures, rumors, and conspiracy theories to spreading xenophobia and panic. Addressing the issue requires solving a number of challenging problems such as identifying messages containing claims, determining their check-worthiness and factuality, and their potential to do harm as well as the nature of that harm, to mention just a few. To address this gap, we release a large dataset of 16K manually annotated tweets for fine-grained disinformation analysis that (i) focuses on COVID-19, (ii) combines the perspectives and the interests of journalists, fact-checkers, social media platforms, policy makers, and society, and (iii) covers Arabic, Bulgarian, Dutch, and English.

The outbreak was originally reported in Wuhan, China, but has subsequently been spread world-widely. As the COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world, computed tomography (CT) has become essentially important for fast diagnoses. Thus, it is urgent to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians to identify COVID-19-infected patients by CT images. We collected chest CT scans of 88 patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 from hospitals of two provinces in China, 101 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy persons for comparison and modeling. A deep learning-based CT diagnosis system was developed to identify patients with COVID-19. The experimental results showed that our model can accurately identify the COVID-19 patients from the healthy with an AUC of 0.99, recall (sensitivity) of 0.93, and precision of 0.96. When integrating three types of CT images, our model achieved a recall of 0.93 with precision of 0.86 for discriminating COVID-19 patients from others. Moreover, our model could extract main lesion features, especially the ground-glass opacity (GGO) that is visually helpful for assisted diagnoses by doctors.

443306,The Telematic solutions in plastic surgery during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Background: The trans-membrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cell entry and infection. Efficacy and safety of TMPRSS2 inhibitors in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have not been evaluated in randomized trials. Methods: We conducted an investigator-initiated, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial in patients hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from April 4, to December 31, 2020. Within 48 h of admission, participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive the TMPRSS2 inhibitor camostat mesilate 200 mg three times daily for 5 days or placebo. The primary outcome was time to discharge or clinical improvement measured as &#8805;2 points improvement on a 7-point ordinal scale. Other outcomes included 30-day mortality, safety and change in oropharyngeal viral load. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04321096. EudraCT Number: 2020-001,200-42. Findings: 137 patients were assigned to receive camostat mesilate and 68 to placebo. Median time to clinical improvement was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3 to 7) in the camostat group and 5 days (IQR, 2 to 10) in the placebo group (P = 0·31). The hazard ratio for 30-day mortality in the camostat compared with the placebo group was 0·82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0·24 to 2·79; P = 0·75). The frequency of adverse events was similar in the two groups. Median change in viral load from baseline to day 5 in the camostat group was -0·22 log10 copies/mL (p <0·05) and -0·82 log10 in the placebo group (P <0·05). Interpretation: Under this protocol, camostat mesilate treatment was not associated with increased adverse events during hospitalization for Covid-19 and did not affect time to clinical improvement, progression to ICU admission or mortality.","Gunst, Jesper D; Staerke, Nina B; Pahus, Marie H; Kristensen, Lena H; Bodilsen, Jacob; Lohse, Nicolai; Dalgaard, Lars S; Brønnum, Dorthe; Fröbert, Ole; Hønge, Bo; Johansen, Isik S; Monrad, Ida; Erikstrup, Christian; Rosendal, Regitze; Vilstrup, Emil; Mariager, Theis; Bove, Dorthe G; Offersen, Rasmus; Shakar, Shakil; Cajander, Sara; Jørgensen, Nis P; Sritharan, Sajitha S; Breining, Peter; Jespersen, Søren; Mortensen, Klaus L; Jensen, Mads L; Kolte, Lilian; Frattari, Giacomo S; Larsen, Carsten S; Storgaard, Merete; Nielsen, Lars P; Tolstrup, Martin; Sædder, Eva A; Østergaard, Lars J; Ngo, Hien T T; Jensen, Morten H; Højen, Jesper F; Kjolby, Mads; Søgaard, Ole S",EClinicalMedicine,,470

443829,Online psychological counselling during lockdown reduces anxiety symptoms and negative affect: Insights from Italian framework,2021,"The COVID-19 virus has caused a global pandemic since March 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided guidelines on how to reduce the spread of the virus and one of the most important measures is social distancing. Maintaining a minimum of one meter distance from other people is strongly suggested to reduce the risk of infection. This has created a strong interest in monitoring the social distances either as a safety measure or to study how the measures have affected human behavior and country-wise differences in this. The need for automatic social distance estimation algorithms is evident, but there is no suitable test benchmark for such algorithms. Collecting images with measured ground-truth pair-wise distances between all the people using different camera settings is cumbersome. Furthermore, performance evaluation for social distance estimation algorithms is not straightforward and there is no widely accepted evaluation protocol. In this paper, we provide a dataset of varying images with measured pair-wise social distances under different camera positionings and focal length values. We suggest a performance evaluation protocol and provide a benchmark to easily evaluate social distance estimation algorithms. We also propose a method for automatic social distance estimation. Our method takes advantage of object detection and human pose estimation. It can be applied on any single image as long as focal length and sensor size information are known. The results on our benchmark are encouraging with 92% human detection rate and only 28.9% average error in distance estimation among the detected people.","Seker, Mert; Mannisto, Anssi; Iosifidis, Alexandros; Raitoharju, Jenni",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06759v3.pdf,470

Exposure(s)Confirmed COVID-19 positive by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Main outcomes were percentages of patients prescribed medications, overall, by age group, and by comorbidity based on hospitalization status. Use percentage by month of COVID-19 diagnosis was measured. Cumulative count of potential therapeutic options was measured over time. ResultsDataset included 22897 unique patients with COVID-19 (mean [SD] age, 42.4 [20.4] years; 12154 [53%] female). Among the sample, 6326 28%) were non-Hispanic White, 8475 (37%) were Hispanic, 1562 (7%) Asian, and 1313 (6%) Black. A COVID-related hospitalization occurred in 3546 patients. Of the hospitalized patients, more than 30% had baseline comorbidities of hypertension (48%), hyperlipidemia (37%), and type 2 diabetes (35%). Most frequently used medications in patients overall were acetaminophen (21.2%), albuterol (14.9%), ondansetron (13.9%), and enoxaparin (10.8%). Medications used were generally similar across ages and comorbidities. Prior to May, dexamethasone was rarely used, with well under 50 COVID-19 patients that had been hospitalized to that point receiving the medication. By mid-August, more than 500 patients to that point had received dexamethasone. Hydroxychloroquine use effectively halted in COVID-19 hospitalized patients after May. Throughout the period of March to December 2020, enoxaparin was used in the most patients to that point at any instance. By mid-December, more than 2000 in the analysis cohort of hospitalized patients had received enoxaparin. Conclusions and RelevanceIn this retrospective cohort study, across age and comorbidity groups, predominant utilization was for supportive care therapy. Dexamethasone and remdesivir experienced large increases in use. Conversely, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin use markedly dropped. Medication utilization rapidly shifted towards more evidence-concordant treatment of patients with COVID-19 as rigorous study findings emerged.","Watanabe, Jonathan H; Kwon, Jimmy; Nan, Bin; Abeles, Shira R; Mehta, Sanjay",,,470
444036,The trajectory of loneliness in UK young adults during the summer to winter months of COVID-19,2021,"Taking pride in the vibrancy and transparency of democracy, countries such as the USA have prioritized the spread of democracy in its foreign policy. The admirable impact that this political agenda has garnered across the globe pushes us to ponder what China would offer as it aspires for a more prominent position on the international stage. Particularly, how would China foster its image in Asia and, as a result, earn a favorable voice and even all-out support from Asian countries, countries economically underdeveloped and politically volatile? This paper sets out to answer this question by critiquing whether or not popular perceptions of China's political system impact how Asians perceive China's influence in general. Conducting statistical analysis using the fourth wave of Asian Barometer Survey (2016) to assess the above argument, we find that Asians who lend their support for China are more keen to the economic opportunities that China's growing economy offers their country than they are of China's political system. In short, China's authoritarian regime type does not factor into Asians' perception of China, except when individuals are highly educated with and committed to democratic principles.","Xi, Jinrui; Primiano, Christopher",East Asia (Piscataway),,470

The prevention of DFU may be achieved by the identification of patients at risk of DFU and the institution of preventative measures through education and offloading. Several studies have reported that thermogram images may help to detect an increase in plantar temperature prior to DFU. However, the distribution of plantar temperature may be heterogeneous, making it difficult to quantify and utilize to predict outcomes. We have compared a machine learning-based scoring technique with feature selection and optimization techniques and learning classifiers to several state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on foot thermogram images and propose a robust solution to identify the diabetic foot. A comparatively shallow CNN model, MobilenetV2 achieved an F1 score of ~95% for a two-feet thermogram image-based classification and the AdaBoost Classifier used 10 features and achieved an F1 score of 97 %. A comparison of the inference time for the best-performing networks confirmed that the proposed algorithm can be deployed as a smartphone application to allow the user to monitor the progression of the DFU in a home setting.","Khandakar, Amith; Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

Our focus is the potential impact of COVID-19 on widening access to medicine. We provide an account of the process, in the form of comparative cases, of applying for medical school for two applicants from differing backgrounds. Three challenges were identified: family circumstances and support (financial security and parental educational support); staying connected (access to educational material, technology and Wifi); getting the grades and meeting other entry criteria (predicting grades and work experience). We propose that medical schools adopt drastic measures to protect widening access including increasing the use of aptitude tests, contextualised admissions, online multiple mini interviews (MMIs), creative outreach and promotion of alternative means of gaining relevant experience.","Smith, Katherine Gibson; Cleland, Jennifer",J R Coll Physicians Edinb,,470
445230,Adaptation and psychometric evaluation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale in the general Colombian population,2021,"The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has placed an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems around the world. In patients who experience severe disease, acute respiratory distress is often accompanied by a pathological immune reaction, sometimes referred to as 'cytokine storm'. One hallmark feature of the profound inflammatory state seen in patients with COVID-19 who succumb to pneumonia and hypoxia is marked elevation of serum cytokines, especially interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 17 (IL-17), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Initial experience from the outbreaks in Italy, China and the USA has anecdotally demonstrated improved outcomes for critically ill patients with COVID-19 with the administration of cytokine-modulatory therapies, especially anti-IL-6 agents. Although ongoing trials are investigating anti-IL-6 therapies, access to these therapies is a concern, especially as the numbers of cases worldwide continue to climb. An immunology-informed approach may help identify alternative agents to modulate the pathological inflammation seen in patients with COVID-19. Drawing on extensive experience administering these and other immune-modulating therapies, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer offers this perspective on potential alternatives to anti-IL-6 that may also warrant consideration for management of the systemic inflammatory response and pulmonary compromise that can be seen in patients with severe COVID-19.","Arnaldez, Fernanda I; O039,; Day, Steven J; Drake, Charles G; Fox, Bernard A; Fu, Bingqing; Urba, Walter J; Montesarchio, Vincenzo; Weber, Jeffrey S; Wei, Haiming; Wigginton, Jon M; Ascierto, Paolo Antonio",J. immunotherap. cancer,,470

Predisposing factors to contracting COVID-19 and to severe outcomes have been described in registries but were not compared between solid tumors and hematological malignancies. METHOD: This retrospective single oncologic center study included adults with solid tumors or hematological malignancies referred to testing by naso-pharyngeal swab for a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from March 10 to May 18, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 212 patients were included in the study. Forty-five (21%) were tested positive with SARS-CoV-2. The univariate analysis with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR as a dependent variable reveals significant odds ratios (ORs) for age-with a mean of 62.5 years-(OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.08), performance status &#8805;2 (OR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.22-4.70), inpatient status (OR: 2.36, 95%CI: 1.11-4.91), and hematological malignancies (OR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.23-4.96). In contrast, OR for solid tumors reveals a negative association (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.20-0.81). When integrating severe outcome (ICU admission or COVID-19-related death) as a dependent variable, the univariate logistic regression model shows significant ORs for pre-existing lymphopenia (OR: 4.0, 95% CI: 1.17-15.04), hematological malignancies (OR: 3.73, 95% CI: 1.09-13.80), and a negative association for solid tumors (OR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.07-0.92). CONCLUSION: In patients referred for SARS-CoV-2 testing, hematological malignancies were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes. Other factors were age and inpatient status.","Goudsmit, Anouk; Cubilier, Edouard; Meert, Anne-Pascale; Aftimos, Philippe; Stathopoulos, Konstantinos; Spilleboudt, Chloe; Loizidou, Angela",Support. care cancer,,470

447836,From stigma to forgetfulness: The rights of people with psychosocial disabilities in the new Middle Ages of the Covid era,2020,"BACKGROUND: A high incidence of pulmonary embolism has been described during the coronavirus pandemic. METHODS: This work is a single-center retrospective study which reviewed computed tomography pulmonary angiograms ordered due to suspected pulmonary embolism during two periods: from March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020 (pandemic) and during the same interval in 2019 (control). RESULTS: Twenty-two pulmonary embolisms were diagnosed during the control period and 99 in the pandemic, 74 of which were associated with COVID-19. Of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 5.3% had a pulmonary embolism, with a delay between the two diagnoses of 9.1 ± 8.4 days. During the pandemic, patients with pulmonary embolism had fewer predisposing conditions (previous pulmonary embolism 5.1 vs. 18.2%, p = .05; previous surgery 2 vs. 35.4%, p = .0001; deep vein thrombosis 11.1 vs. 45.5%, p = .0001); peripheral pulmonary embolisms were the most frequent (73.5 vs. 50%, p = . 029). CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk of having a pulmonary embolism during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which affects patients with a different clinical profile and more often causes distal pulmonary embolisms.","García-Lledó, A; Del Palacio-Salgado, M; Álvarez-Sanz, C; Pérez-Gil, M M; Cruz-Díaz, Á","Rev. clin. esp.

We evaluate the temporal COVID-19 infection behavior among HCW-D, HCW-A, and non-HCW. MethodsFrom February 2020 to April 2021, trained nurses recorded age, gender, occupation, and symptoms in a COVID-19 testing outpatient health center. We allocated data into weekly time fractals and calculated the proportion of COVID-19 positive among HCW vs. non-HCW and incorporated an ARFIMA model (traditionally used in weather forecast) to predict future cases of COVID-19. ResultsAmong 8,998 COVID-19 RT-PCR tests, 3,462 (42%) patients were HCW-D, and 933 (11%) were HCW-A. Overall, 1,914 (21.3%) returned positive, representing 27%, 25% and 19% of HCW-D, HCW-A and non-HCW, respectively. HCW-D or HCW-A were significantly more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than non-HCW (OR=1.5, p<0.0001). The percentage of positive to negative test results remained steady over time. In the positive cases, the percentage of HCW to non-HCW declined significantly over time (Mann-Kendal trend test: tau=-0.58, p<0.0001). Our ARFIMA model showed a long-memory infection pattern in the occurrence of new COVID-19 cases lasting for months. Average error was 1.9 cases per week comparing predicted to actual values three months later (May-July 2021). ConclusionHCW have a sustained 50% higher risk of COVID-19 positivity in the pandemic. Time-series analysis showed a long-memory infection pattern with virus spread mainly among HCWs before the general population.

449681,Preparing for COVID-19: The lessons from SARS 2003 in Canada,2020,"BACKGROUND: We investigated the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Italian plasma pools and intravenous immunoglobulins sent to our Institute (Italian National Institute of Health - Istituto Superiore di Sanità) in the context of the Official Control Authority Batch Release. The plasma pools were made up from donations collected in several different Italian regions from May 2017 to October 2020, i.e. in the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All plasma pools were initially tested for the qualitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein using the Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test kit. Plasma pools positive for these antibodies were further tested using the Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S test kit for the quantitative detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain. All plasma pools showing reactivity to these antibodies were tested undiluted for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the Grifols Procleix SARS-CoV-2 transcription-mediated amplification assay. Intravenous immunoglobulins were tested using both test kits to determine the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: All plasma pools made up from donations collected in the pre-pandemic period were negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein. Of the plasma pools made up from donations collected from December 2018 to March 2020, only 1 pool out of 68 (1.4%), that was made up from donations from the Lombardy region, was reactive for these antibodies. Interestingly, 105 out of 174 (60.3%) of the plasma pools made up from donations collected from November 2018 to October 2020 showed the presence of these antibodies. All plasma pools positive for these antibodies were tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain and were confirmed positive. DISCUSSION: None of these plasma pools tested were reactive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In the case of intravenous immunoglobulins, 20 out of 25 (80%) batches showed the presence of both anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, reflecting the concentration in the plasma pools used for their production.","Pisani, Giulio; Cristiano, Karen; Simeoni, Matteo; Martina, Antonio; Pati, Ilaria; Carocci, Alberto; Gaggioli, Andrea; Marino, Francesco; Adriani, Daniela; Pupella, Simonetta; Candura, Fabio; De Angelis, Vincenzo","Blood transfus.

450207,Virtual Care Takes Off During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"This article reviews the performance of the Fijian economy from 2015 to 2019. After several years of decent growth (around 5%), GDP growth fell to as low as 0.5% in 2019. Earlier hopes that a ‘new normal’ of GDP growth of around 5% per annum had been established have faded. The principle reason for this, it is argued, is a lack of business confidence, which is associated with the 2018 elections, but more fundamentally with a lack of faith in Fiji's political system. At the same time, the government has also been forced to embark on a course of fiscal consolidation, as announced in the 2019–2020 National Budget, due to disappointing revenue collections and undisciplined expenditure in earlier years. The banking sector is hamstrung by a lack of liquidity. This article is written to understand the Fijian economy pre-COVID-19, but with the sharp downturn in economic growth in particular due to the impact of the COVID-19 virus on tourism—Fiji's most important sector—and no room for fiscal expansion, growth prospects in Fiji are currently not bright. An improved medium-term outlook will require greater confidence (both political and economic) to increase investment, both foreign and domestic. Reforms to reduce the costs of doing business will also help.","Gounder, Neelesh",Asia Pacafic Policy. Stud.,,470

Yet very little is known about the reliability of the highly speculative investment advice disseminated on WSB. This paper analyses WSB data spanning from January 2019 to April 2021 in order to assess how successful an investment strategy relying on the community's recommendations could have been. We detect buy and sell advice and identify the community's most popular stocks, based on which we define a WSB portfolio. Our evaluation shows that this portfolio has grown approx. 200% over the last three years and approx. 480% over the last year, significantly outperforming the S&P500. The average short-term accuracy of buy and sell signals, in contrast, is not found to be significantly better than randomly or equally distributed buy decisions within the same time frame. However, we present a technique for estimating whether posts are proactive as opposed to reactive and show that by focusing on a subset of more promising buy signals, a trader could have made investments yielding higher returns than the broader market or the strategy of trusting all posted buy signals. Lastly, the analysis is also conducted specifically for the period before 2021 in order to factor out the effects of the GameStop hype of January 2021 - the results confirm the conclusions and suggest that the 2021 hype merely amplified pre-existing characteristics.","Buz, Tolga; Melo, Gerard de",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02728v1.pdf,470

METHODS: Between March 2016 and January 2019, 66 rectal cancer patients who completed biplane TRUS plus UE and CEUS for preoperative workup and were treated by primary total mesorectal excision (TME) were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The accuracy of TRUS plus UE and CEUS in all T staging of rectal cancer was 69.7%. The highest accuracy was achieved in the T3 stage (87.5%), while it was 71.4 and 50.0% in the T1 and T2 stage, respectively. The mean sizes of uT1-T2 lesions and uT3-T4 lesions were 30.0 ± 10.6 mm (range, 10.0-55.0) and 40.2 ± 11.2 mm (range, 14.0-57.0), respectively (p < 0.001). According to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to predict pT stages (pT1,2 vs. pT3), the optimal cut-off value of lesions in greatest dimension was 28.5 mm by TRUS with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.769, and the optimal cut-off values of peak systolic velocity (PSV) and resistive index (RI) were 18.8 cm/sec and 0.645, respectively. The AUCs of PSV and RI were 0.588 and 0.555, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic accuracy of TRUS plus UE and CEUS in T staging of rectal cancer does not reach the excellent published study results, especially for patients with early rectal cancer.

454492,A comparison of direct laryngoscopy versus videolaryngoscopy using aerosol box for intubation in emergency surgeries during Covid-19 pandemic: A pilot study,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review considers the potential and demonstrated impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on the sexually transmissible infection (STI)/HIV transmission. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 increases the vulnerability of those at highest risk of acquiring STI/HIV. Altered health-seeking behaviour, reductions in STI/HIV clinic capacity, service disruptions and redeployment of human resources to assist COVID-19 control efforts have impacted on STI/HIV control programmes. Reports of reduced STI incidence are emerging, but it is hard to determine whether this is real or due to decreased testing during COVID-19 lockdown periods. Fear of COVID-19 and implemented control measures have altered STI/HIV transmission dynamics. Sexual health services adapted to the pandemic by reducing face-to-face patient encounters in favour of telehealth and mail-based initiatives as well as more stringent triage practice. Many sexual health and HIV treatment services now operate at reduced capacity and experience ongoing service disruptions, which necessarily translates into poorer outcomes for patients and their communities. SUMMARY: In the short-term, COVID-19 related sexual behaviour change is driving STI/HIV transmission downwards. However, the impacts of the global COVID-19 response on sexual health-seeking behaviour and STI/HIV services threaten to drive STI/HIV transmission upwards. Ultimately, the expected rebound in STI/HIV incidence will require an appropriate and timely public health response.

455601,Bereavement care during and after the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To more comprehensively estimate COVID-19-related mortality in Los Angeles County by determining excess all-cause mortality and pneumonia, influenza, or COVID (PIC) mortality. DESIGN: We reviewed vital statistics data to identify deaths registered in Los Angeles County between March 15, 2020, and August 15, 2020. Deaths with an ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) code for pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 listed as an immediate or underlying cause of death were classified as PIC deaths. Expected deaths were calculated using negative binomial regression. Excess mortality was determined by subtracting the expected from the observed number of weekly deaths. The Department of Public Health conducts surveillance for COVID-19-associated deaths: persons who died of nontraumatic/nonaccidental causes within 60 days of a positive COVID-19 test result were classified as confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Deaths without a reported positive SARS-Cov-2 polymerase chain reaction result were classified as probable COVID-19 deaths if COVID-19 was listed on their death certificate or the death occurred 60 to 90 days of a positive test. We compared excess PIC deaths with the number of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths ascertained by surveillance. SETTING: Los Angeles County. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of Los Angeles County who died. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Excess mortality. RESULTS: There were 7208 excess all-cause and 5128 excess PIC deaths during the study period. The Department of Public Health also reported 5160 confirmed and 323 probable COVID-19-associated deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The number of excess PIC deaths estimated by our model was approximately equal to the number of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths identified by surveillance. This suggests our surveillance definition for confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths might be sufficiently sensitive for capturing the true burden of deaths caused directly or indirectly by COVID-19.","Traub, Elizabeth; Amoon, Aryana T; Rollin-Alamillo, Louise; Haddix, Meredith; Poortinga, Kathleen; Ibrahim, Mireille; Feregrino, Gustavo; Foo, Chelsea; Itano, Alison; Lee, Rebecca; Fisher, Rebecca; Jarashow, Claire; Balter, Sharon; Gounder, Prabhu",J Public Health Manag Pract,,470

456186,COVID-19 Pandemic: Can Maintaining Optimal Zinc Balance Enhance Host Resistance?,2020,"Surveillance of highly pathogenic viruses circulating in both human and animal populations is crucial to unveil endemic infections and potential zoonotic reservoirs. Monitoring the burden of disease by serological assay could be used as an early warning system for imminent outbreaks as an increased seroprevalance often precedes larger outbreaks. However, the multitude of highly pathogenic viruses necessitates the need to identify specific antibodies against several targets from both humans as well as from potential reservoir animals such as bats. In order to address this, we have developed a broadly reactive multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) for the detection of antibodies against several highly pathogenic viruses from both humans and animals. To this aim, nucleoproteins (NP) of Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg virus (MARV) and nucleocapsid proteins (NP) of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus and Dobrava-Belgrade hantavirus were employed in a 5-plex assay for IgG detection. After optimisation, specific binding to each respective NP was shown by testing sera from humans and non-human primates with known infection status. The usefulness of our assay for serosurveillance was shown by determining the immune response against the NP antigens in a panel of 129 human serum samples collected in Guinea between 2011 and 2012 in comparison to a panel of 88 sera from the German blood bank. We found good agreement between our MMIA and commercial or in-house reference methods by ELISA or IIFT with statistically significant higher binding to both EBOV NP and MARV NP coupled microspheres in the Guinea panel. Finally, the MMIA was successfully adapted to detect antibodies from bats that had been inoculated with EBOV- and MARV- virus-like particles, highlighting the versatility of this technique and potentially enabling the monitoring of wildlife as well as human populations with this assay. We were thus able to develop and validate a sensitive and broadly reactive high-throughput serological assay which could be used as a screening tool to detect antibodies against several highly pathogenic viruses.","Surtees, Rebecca; Stern, Daniel; Ahrens, Katharina; Kromarek, Nicole; Lander, Angelika; Kreher, Petra; Weiss, Sabrina; Hewson, Roger; Punch, Emma K; Barr, John N; Witkowski, Peter T; Couacy-Hymann, Emmanuel; Marzi, Andrea; Dorner, Brigitte G; Kurth, Andreas",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,470

Our key finding is that a client and streaming server system with sub-15ms latency can achieve 5x better compression than traditional techniques while also using simpler software algorithms than previous work.","Hsiao, Luke; Krajancich, Brooke; Levis, Philip; Wetzstein, Gordon; Winstein, Keith",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12720v3.pdf,470

457933,Factors Influencing Nurses' Work Interruption in Wuhan Isolation Wards During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) is an infrequent subtype of ovarian cancer, corresponding to 5% of epithelial neoplasms. This subtype of ovarian carcinoma characteristically has molecular features, pathogenesis, clinical behaviour, sensitivity to chemotherapy, and prognosis distinct to high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). Knowing the difference between LGSC and other ovarian serous tumours is vital to guide clinical management, which currently is only possible histologically. However, imaging can provide several clues that allow differentiating LGSC from other tumours and enable precise staging and follow-up of ovarian cancer treatment. Characteristically, LGSC appears as mixed lesions with variable papillary projections and solid components, usually in different proportions from those detected in serous borderline tumour and HGSC. Calcified extracellular bodies, known as psammoma bodies, are also a common feature of LGSC, frequently detectable within lymphadenopathies and metastases associated with this type of tumour. In addition, the characterisation of magnetic resonance imaging enhancement also plays an essential role in calculating the probability of malignancy of these lesions. As such, in this review, we discuss and update the distinct radiological modalities features and the clinicopathologic characteristics of LGSC to allow radiologists to be familiarised with them and to narrow the differential diagnosis when facing this type of tumour.","Amante, Sofia; Santos, Filipa; Cunha, Teresa Margarida",Insights Imaging,,470

Dans une étude de cohorte rétrospective, nous avons précédemment distingué les facteurs associés au coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) et à la dengue de ceux associés à d’autres maladies fébriles (OFI). L’objectif de cette nouvelle analyse était de développer un score pour discriminer les deux infections à leur présentation. Méthodes Les facteurs associés aux deux infections ont été identifiés à l’aide de modèles de régression logistique multinomiale (OFI pris comme sujets contrôles) parmi tous les sujets suspects de la COVID-19 ayant fréquenté le centre de dépistage du coronavirus de type 2 (SRAS-CoV-2) de l’hôpital universitaire de Saint-Pierre, île de La Réunion, entre le 23 mars et 10 mai 2020. Deux scores COVIDENGUE ont été développés et validés en interne par bootstrapping pour prédire chaque infection après pondération des odd ratios selon une règle prédéfinie. Le pouvoir discriminant de chaque score a été évalué à l’aide des aires sous la courbe ROC (« receiver operating characteristic curve »). Leur calibration a été évaluée à l’aide du test d’adéquation modifié d’Hosmer–Lemeshow pour les variables dépendantes polytomiques. Résultats Sur les deux mois de la période d’étude, 80 cas de COVID-19, 60 cas de dengue non sévères et 872 cas d’OFI ont été diagnostiqués. Les scores COVIDENGUE étaient composés de 11 critères : contact avec un cas positif de COVID-19 (+3 points pour COVID-19 ;0 point pour la dengue), retour de voyage à l’étranger dans les 15 jours précédents (+3 ;−1), antécédents de dengue (+1 ;+3), tabagisme actif (−3 ;0), courbatures (0 ;+5), toux (0 ;−2), symptômes d’infection des voies respiratoires supérieures (−1 ;−1), anosmie (+7 ;−1), maux de tête (0 ;+5), douleur rétro-orbitaire (−1 ;+5) et présentation tardive (&gt;3 jours) à l’hôpital (+1 ;0). L’aire sous la courbe ROC était de 0,79 (IC95 % : 0,76–0,82) pour la COVID-19 et de 0,88 (IC95 % : 0,85–0,90) pour la dengue. La calibration était satisfaisante pour les deux scores (valeurs de p du Chi2 du Goodness-of-Fit à 0,94 et 0,55, respectivement). Pour la COVID-19, la sensibilité était de 97 % au seuil de 0 point et la spécificité de 99 % au seuil de 10 points. Pour la dengue, la sensibilité était de 93 % au seuil de 2 points et la spécificité de 94 % au seuil de 10 points. Conclusion Les scores COVIDENGUE sont des outils discriminants pour distinguer la COVID-19 et la dengue des autres maladies fébriles dans le contexte d’une co-épidémie à l’île de La Réunion. D’autres études sont nécessaires pour valider ou affiner ces scores dans d’autres contextes épidémiques pour la COVID-19 (selon, par exemple, le niveau de circulation des nouveaux variants) ou d’endémie pour la dengue (selon, par exemple, les proportions de dengues primaires et de dengues secondaires), ces situations épidémiologiques pouvant modifier la présentation clinique de ces deux affections.","Levin, C.; Andry, F.; Bruneau, L.; Joubert, A.; Accot, F.; Maillard, O.; Bertolotti, A.; Gérardin, P.",Revue d&#039;Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,,470

458435,COVID-19: Current Understanding of Pathophysiology,2020,"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma, widely utilized in viral infections that induce neutralizing antibodies, has been proposed for COVID-19, and preliminary evidence shows that it might have beneficial effect. Our objective was to determine the risk factors for 28-days mortality in patients who received convalescent plasma for COVID-19 compared to those who did not, who were admitted to hospitals in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, throughout the pandemic. METHODS: This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 2-month duration beginning on June 1, 2020, including unselected, consecutive adult patients with diagnosed COVID-19, admitted to 215 hospitals with pneumonia. Epidemiological and clinical variables were registered in the Provincial Hospital Bed Management System. Convalescent plasma was supplied as part of a centralized, expanded access program. RESULTS: We analyzed 3,529 patients with pneumonia, predominantly male, aged 62±17, with arterial hypertension and diabetes as main comorbidities; 51.4% were admitted to the ward, 27.1% to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 21.7% to the ICU with mechanical ventilation requirement (ICU-MV). 28-day mortality was 34.9%; and was 26.3%, 30.1% and 61.4% for ward, ICU and ICU-MV patients. Convalescent plasma was administered to 868 patients (24.6%); their 28-day mortality was significantly lower (25.5% vs. 38.0%, p<0.001). No major adverse effects occurred. Logistic regression analysis identified age, ICU admission with and without MV requirement, diabetes, and preexistent cardiovascular disease as independent predictors of 28-day mortality, whereas convalescent plasma administration acted as a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the administration of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the hospital might be associated with improved outcomes.","Salazar, Martín R; González, Soledad E; Regairaz, Lorena; Ferrando, Noelia S; González Martínez, Verónica V; Carrera Ramos, Patricia M; Muñoz, Laura; Pesci, Santiago A; Vidal, Juan M; Kreplak, Nicolás; Estenssoro, Elisa",PLoS One,,470

459726,COVID-19 and the Health Workforce,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the role of international travel in spreading infections. Travellers visiting friends and relatives (VFR) are at higher risk of acquiring infections than other travellers, therefore improving the travel health behaviour of these travellers is important. Ethnic Chinese are one of the largest migrant groups in many countries, yet there have been no published studies regarding this population as VFR travellers. We present findings of a study of Australian Chinese VFR travellers relevant to the pandemic response. METHODS: In 2013, five focus groups were conducted with Australian Chinese VFR travellers, exploring topics such as vaccines, face masks, outbreaks and travel health seeking behaviour. Participants were aged 18 years or older and had travelled to China for VFR purposes in the preceding 18 months. Sessions were recorded and transcribed, and thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Participants viewed VFR travel as low risk, and underestimated the risks associated with travelling during an outbreak. However, they were generally willing to receive pre-travel vaccination specifically for an outbreak, but not otherwise. Attitudes towards face masks and other infection control measures were mixed. Multiple factors influenced their travel health behaviour, including low risk awareness, misconceptions, and cultural barriers to seeking health care. CONCLUSION: Our research found that Chinese VFR travellers undertake suboptimal precautions related to VFR travel, associated with an underestimation of risks. While they share many characteristics with other VFR travellers, unique cultural health beliefs should be taken into account when developing risk communication and educational interventions as part of a pandemic response.","Ma, Tara; Heywood, Anita; MacIntyre, C Raina",Infect.

460606,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Physician-Pharmaceutical Office-Based Interactions,2021,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare concerns, social distancing, health care disruptions, and telemedicine use in patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease (ARD) and non-ARD and to evaluate factors associated with immunomodulatory medication interruptions. METHODS: Patients in a multistate community rheumatology practice network completed surveys from April 2020 to May 2020. Adults with common ARD (rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus) or non-ARD (gout, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis) were evaluated. Concerns about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), social distancing, health care disruptions, and telemedicine use were compared in patients with ARD versus non-ARD, adjusting for demographics, rural residence, and zipcode-based measures of socioeconomic status and COVID-19 activity. Factors associated with medication interruptions were assessed in patients with ARD. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 2319/36 193 (6.4%) patients with non-ARD and 6885/64 303 (10.7%) with ARD. Concerns about COVID-19 and social distancing behaviors were similar in both groups, although patients receiving a biologic or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor reported greater concerns and were more likely to avoid friends/family, stores, or leaving the house. Patients with ARD were less likely to avoid office visits (45.2% vs. 51.0%, odds ratio [OR] 0.79 [0.70-0.89]) with similar telemedicine use. Immunomodulatory medications were stopped in 9.7% of patients with ARD, usually (86.9%) without a physician recommendation. Compared with patients with an office visit, the likelihood of stopping medication was higher for patients with a telemedicine visit (OR 1.54 [1.19-1.99]) but highest for patients with no visits (OR 2.26 [1.79-2.86]). CONCLUSION: Patients with ARD and non-ARD reported similar concerns about COVID-19 and similar social distancing behaviors. Missed office visits were strongly associated with interruptions in immunomodulatory medication.","George, Michael D; Baker, Joshua F; Banerjee, Shubhasree; Busch, Howard; Curtis, David; Danila, Maria I; Gavigan, Kelly; Kirby, Daniel; Merkel, Peter A; Munoz, George; Nowell, William Benjamin; Stewart, Patrick; Sunshine, William; Venkatachalam, Shilpa; Xie, Fenglong; Curtis, Jeffrey R",,,470

The incidence of COVID-19, the disease associated with this new coronavirus, continues to rise. The epidemic threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems, and identifying those regions where the disease burden is likely to be high relative to the rest of the country is critical for enabling prudent and effective distribution of emergency medical care and public health resources. Globally, the risk of severe outcomes associated with COVID-19 has consistently been observed to increase with age2,3. We used age-specific mortality patterns in tandem with demographic data to map projections of the cumulative case burden of COVID-19 and the subsequent burden on healthcare resources. The analysis was performed at the county level across the United States, assuming a scenario in which 20% of the population of each county acquires infection. We identified counties that will probably be consistently, heavily affected relative to the rest of the country across a range of assumptions about transmission patterns, such as the basic reproductive rate, contact patterns and the efficacy of quarantine. We observed a general pattern that per capita disease burden and relative healthcare system demand may be highest away from major population centers. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring equitable and adequate allocation of medical care and public health resources to communities outside of major urban areas.","Miller, Ian F; Becker, Alexander D; Grenfell, Bryan T; Metcalf, C Jessica E",Nat Med,,470

462252,Global health disparities in vulnerable populations of psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rapid shift to online delivery in higher education. This learning and teaching environment is associated with reduced student engagement, a crucial prerequisite of student satisfaction, retention and success. This paper presents a case study that explored student engagement in the synchronous virtual learning environment, during the mandatory move to exclusive online learning in Australian higher education in April to June 2020. Three university instructors used the Teaching and Learning Circles Model to observe a series of their peers' synchronous virtual classrooms, from which they reflected on ways to enhance their own practice. The findings demonstrate how student engagement in these classrooms can be strengthened across the four constructs of Kahu and Nelson’s (2018) engagement conceptual framework: belonging;emotional response;wellbeing and self-efficacy. The case study also reveals limitations of the synchronous virtual environment as a means of supporting student engagement in the online learning and teaching environment, and proposes ways to address them. Against emerging reports of increased mental health issues among isolated university students during the current pandemic, the case study's recommendations to improve student wellbeing and belonging are particularly salient. This article also highlights the usefulness of the Teaching and Learning Circles Model of peer observation as a way to guide its participants' reflections on their own practice, support their collegiality with academic peers and build their confidence and competence in the synchronous virtual learning environment. © 2021, University of Wollongong.

462760,Lessons from the frontlines: a junior doctor's experience of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in a resource-limited setting,2021,"BACKGROUND: To increase bed capacity and resources, hospitals have postponed elective surgeries, although the financial impact of this decision is unknown. We sought to report elective surgical case distribution, associated gross hospital revenue and regional hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity as elective surgical cases are cancelled and then resumed under simulated trends of COVID-19 incidence. METHODS: A retrospective, cohort analysis was performed using insurance claims from 161 million enrollees from the MarketScan database from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2017. COVID-19 cases were calculated using Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation models. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports on the number of hospitalized and intensive care patients by age estimated the number of cases seen in the ICU, the reduction in elective surgeries and the financial impact of this from historic claims data, using a denominator of all inpatient revenue and outpatient surgeries. RESULTS: Assuming 5% infection prevalence, cancelling all elective procedures decreases ICU overcapacity from 160 to 130%, but these elective surgical cases contribute 78% (IQR 74, 80) (1.1 trillion (T) US dollars) to inpatient hospital plus outpatient surgical gross revenue per year. Musculoskeletal, circulatory and digestive category elective surgical cases compose 33% ($447B) of total revenue. CONCLUSIONS: Procedures involving the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and digestive system account for the largest loss of hospital gross revenue when elective surgery is postponed. As hospital bed capacity increases following the COVID-19 pandemic, restoring volume of these elective cases will help maintain revenue. In these estimates, adopting universal masking would help to avoid overcapacity in all states.","Tonna, Joseph E; Hanson, Heidi A; Cohan, Jessica N; McCrum, Marta L; Horns, Joshua J; Brooke, Benjamin S; Das, Rupam; Kelly, Brenna C; Campbell, Alexander John; Hotaling, James",BMC Health Serv Res,,470
462761,Lessons from the frontlines: a junior doctor's experience of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in a resource-limited setting,2021,"The covid-19 pandemic has forced universities around the world to transition to online, remote, or hybrid instruction. This challenge is exacerbated in the laboratory sciences as the limitations on in-person instruction force instructors to conduct curriculum triage and develop new creative avenues for providing meaningful experiential learning opportunities. However, some learning objectives such as nucleic acid structure function relationships can still be pursued with the rigor necessary to train future biochemists and biophysicists using web-based RNA and DNA structural analysis programs. The decades of research in nucleic acid structure prediction algorithms and modeling programs have laid an exceptional foundation for remote teaching and learning in the biosciences. We evaluate the various nucleic acid secondary and tertiary structure prediction programs and their capabilities for remote laboratory activities and research projects. We identify the particular strengths of each program and learning objectives each one can be used to pursue. We also present a series of guided and independent inquiry activities using these prediction programs exploring nucleic acid secondary and tertiary structure suitable for introductory or advanced biochemistry courses using asynchronous or synchronous modalities. Activities include an exploration of nucleic acid secondary structures and relative stabilities, identifying non-canonical interactions within RNA folds, predicting tertiary interactions, comparing predicted structures to published experimentally-determined secondary structures, and investigating how mutations in the nucleic acid sequence can affect secondary and tertiary structure. Tools to increase engagement and discussion in synchronous virtual laboratory sessions are also presented. These activities focus on the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA structure but can be modified for any particular RNA or DNA. Available biophysical technology resources provide an avenue for continuing high-level instruction despite the challenges of classroom and laboratory de-densification.","Mullen Davis, Melissa Sokoloski Joshua Nallagatla Sanjana Tenaglia Brandon",The FASEB Journal,,470

We test our approach in Colombia, which has implemented an unparalleled number of mitigation measures and has reopened its economy earlier than regional neighbors. We find that COVID-19 increases the poverty headcount to a daunting degree (between 3.0 and 9.1 pp increases).

465228,Grief in Covid 19 pandemic,2020,"India has the highest burden of incident tuberculosis (TB) cases and deaths globally. TB is strongly associated with poverty and this risk is largely mediated by undernutrition in India. COVID-19 response related lockdown has resulted in an economic crisis which may double levels of poverty, has exacerbated food insecurity, and disrupted TB services. These developments may have serious implications for TB progression and transmission in India. The nutritional status of a population is a strong determinant of the TB incidence, and undernutrition in adults alone accounts for 32–44% of TB incidence in India. A systematic review has shown that a 14% increase in TB incidence can occur per one unit decrease in body mass index (BMI), across the BMI range of 18.5–30 kg/m2. We believe that one unit decrease in BMI (corresponding to a 2–3 kg weight loss) may result in the poor in India as a result of the lockdown and its aftermath. This may result in an increase in estimated (uncertainty interval) incident TB by 185 610 (180 230, 190 990) cases. A 59% reduction in TB case detection between end March and May 2020, may result in an estimated (uncertainty interval) additional 87 711 (59 998, 120 630) TB deaths [19.5% increase (14.5, 24.7)] in 2020. Disadvantaged social groups and those living in states with higher levels of poverty, under-nutrition,and migrant workers are at particular risk. We suggest enhanced rations including pulses through the public distribution system and direct cash transfers to the poor pending restoration of livelihoods. TB services should be resumed immediately with enhanced efforts at case detection including active case finding. To prevent deaths among TB detected within the national TB programme, systemic identification, referral and management of severe disease at notification should be considered.","Bhargava, Anurag; Shewade, Hemant Deepak",Indian J.

465362,Increased Risk for Family Violence During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying extraordinary measures engaged restrictions of fundamental human rights and liberties to an unprecedented scale. Inevitably, this had implications in the family context as well. Even though children are not considered to be an endangered category from a medical perspective, they are adversely affected by the pandemic in practically all aspects of life, in the short-term and in the long-term. One of the child's rights directly affected is the right to maintain direct contact with both parents on a regular basis. Digital means of communication can somewhat mitigate the lack of personal contact, however, not everyone has access to the necessary technologies and there might be various disagreements about exercising such indirect contact. The closure of judiciary and social services placed the burden of resolving contact related disputes almost entirely upon parents. This paper aims to examine the relevant legal framework and measures taken in relation to the child's right to maintain contact with both parents in the circumstances of the pandemic, with particular focus on the Croatian context and the response of the Croatian authorities to the challenges arisingfrom this extraordinary situation, and to identify actions which could be taken in order to improve the child's unfavourable position.","Radina, Ana PhD Assistant Professor",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,,470

METHODS: Descriptive and qualitative study, with 11 elders hospitalized in a university hospital, aiming to identify their needs for Comfort. RESULTS: Discourses were categorized in four thematic units: Physical, Environmental, Sociocultural, and Psychospiritual. In the Physical context, several subcategories were found, namely, Symptom Relief; Daily Life Activities; Hygiene and personal care; Diet; Sleep and rest. In the Environmental context, the Comfort was considered to be superior than in the elders' home; in the Sociocultural one, family bonds were found to become more distant, triggering feelings of missing one's family and isolation, in the Psychospiritual context, spirituality and religiosity stood out. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: The Comfort needs of the hospitalized elders enable one to reflect on nursing care, offering information to improve the quality of assistance and to attend to the real needs of the elderly.","Oliveira, Sanni Moraes de; Costa, Kátia Neyla de Freitas Macêdo; Santos, Kamyla Félix Oliveira Dos; Oliveira, Jacira Dos Santos; Pereira, Maria Auxiliadora; Fernandes, Maria das Graças Melo",Rev Bras Enferm,,470

466841,"Eating behaviour, physical activity and lifestyle of Italian children during lockdown for COVID-19",2021,"This paper focuses on how technology might reshape payments going forward. It considers the policy issues and choices associated with crypto-currencies, stablecoins and sovereign digital currencies and emphasises that there is no single model for sovereign digital currency design. While Bitcoin and its progenies could be safely ignored by regulators, Facebook’s proposal for Libra, a global stablecoin, brought an immediate and potent response from regulators globally. Any proposal by the private sector to move into the creation of currency — the traditional preserve of sovereigns — was always likely to trigger such a regulatory response, as well as the launch of sovereign digital currencies by other major central banks. While China has moved first, dozens of other countries are now investigating their own central bank digital currencies or other forms of sovereign digital currency. This paper argues that central banks should first focus not on rolling out novel new forms of sovereign digital currencies, but rather on transforming their payment systems. In time, domestic money and payment systems are expected to evolve so that central banks cooperate with (new and old) private entities to launch digital currencies that better underpin monetary and payment systems at the domestic, regional and international levels. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.","Buckley, R.

However, it is unclear how newly synthesized genomes and messenger RNAs can travel from these sealed replication compartments to the cytosol to ensure their translation and the assembly of progeny virions. In this study, we used cellular cryo-electron microscopy to visualize a molecular pore complex that spans both membranes of the double-membrane vesicle and would allow export of RNA to the cytosol. A hexameric assembly of a large viral transmembrane protein was found to form the core of the crown-shaped complex. This coronavirus-specific structure likely plays a key role in coronavirus replication and thus constitutes a potential drug target.","Wolff, Georg; Limpens, Ronald W A L; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C; Laugks, Ulrike; Zheng, Shawn; de Jong, Anja W M; Koning, Roman I; Agard, David A; Grünewald, Kay; Koster, Abraham J; Snijder, Eric J; Bárcena, Montserrat",Science,,470

Our analysis suggests that compared with MUA clinics, clinics in non-MUAs were more likely to conduct a majority of their visits via telehealth before May 1st, 2020. However, later surveys indicated that differences in telehealth use between MUA and non-MUA clinics lessened, suggesting that some of the barriers that MUA clinics initially faced might have resolved over time.

In this report, we use mobile phone data to infer the movements of people between Italian provinces and municipalities, and we analyze the incoming, outcoming and internal mobility flows before and during the national lockdown (March 9th, 2020) and after the closure of non-necessary productive and economic activities (March 23th, 2020). The population flow across provinces and municipalities enable for the modelling of a risk index tailored for the mobility of each municipality or province. Such an index would be a useful indicator to drive counter-measures in reaction to a sudden reactivation of the epidemics. Mobile phone data, even when aggregated to preserve the privacy of individuals, are a useful data source to track the evolution in time of human mobility, hence allowing for monitoring the effectiveness of control measures such as physical distancing. We address the following analytical questions: How does the mobility structure of a territory change? Do incoming and outcoming flows become more predictable during the lockdown, and what are the differences between weekdays and weekends? Can we detect proper local job markets based on human mobility flows, to eventually shape the borders of a local outbreak?","Bonato, Pietro; Cintia, Paolo; Fabbri, Francesco; Fadda, Daniele; Giannotti, Fosca; Lopalco, Pier Luigi; Mazzilli, Sara; Nanni, Mirco; Pappalardo, Luca; Pedreschi, Dino; Penone, Francesco; Rinzivillo, Salvatore; Rossetti, Giulio; Savarese, Marcello; Tavoschi, Lara",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11278v1.pdf,470
468279,Epidemiology of Pediatric Trauma During the COVID-19 Pandemic Shelter in Place,2021,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing demand for post-acute care services, which is amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. AIMS: We studied the pattern of spatial association between post-acute care services and acute care facilities and evaluated how geographic variability could influence their use. METHODS: We compiled data on CMS-certified acute care and critical access hospitals and post-acute health care services (nursing homes, home health care services, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, long-term care hospitals, and hospice facilities). We used the colocation quotient (CLQ) to measure the magnitude and direction of association (clustering or segregation) between post-acute care providers and hospitals. This metric allows pairwise comparison of categorical data; a value <1 indicates spatial segregation and a value >1 spatial clustering. Unity marks the lack of spatial dependence (random distribution). RESULTS: With the exception of nursing homes (CLQ 1.26), all other types of post-acute care providers are spatially segregated from rural critical access hospitals. Long-term care facilities ranked first (had the lowest global CLQ, 0.06), hospice facilities ranked last (had the highest global CLQ estimate, 0.54). Instead, post-acute care services either clustered with (inpatient rehabilitation 2.76, long-term care 2.10, nursing homes 1.37) or were only weakly segregated (home health care 0.86) from acute care hospitals. Home health care (1.44), hospice services (1.46), and nursing homes (1.08) spatially clustered with the same category of services. Results were robust in the sensitivity analysis and we provided illustrative examples of local variation for the states of MA and IA. CONCLUSION: Post-acute care services are isolated from critical access hospitals, and have a clustering pattern with the same category services and acute care hospitals. Such misdistribution of resources may result in both underuse and a substitution effect on the type of post-acute care between rural and urban areas and undermine public health during increasing demand, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ziakas, Panayiotis D; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",PLoS One,,470

METHODS: This study was conducted at 28 centres from February 2020 to April 2020. Participants filled out a 62-item online survey including sociodemographic, COVID-19-related, epilepsy-related and psychological variables and were divided into two groups based on whether their seizure frequency increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chi-square tests and t-tests were used to test differences in significant characteristics. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for seizure worsening. RESULTS: A total of 1,237 adult PWE were enrolled for analysis. Of this sample, 31 (8.33%) patients experienced an increase in seizures during the pandemic. Multivariate logistic regression suggested that feeling nervous about the pandemic (P < 0.05), poor quality of life (P = 0.001), drug reduction/withdrawal (P = 0.032), moderate anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak (P = 0.046) and non-seizure free before the COVID-19 outbreak (P < 0.05) were independently related to seizure increase during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, PWE with poor quality of life and mental status, as well as AED reduction/withdrawal, were more likely to experience seizure increase. This observation highlights the importance of early identification of the population at high risk of seizure worsening and implementation of preventive strategies during the pandemic.","Zeng, Chang; Meng, Hongmei; Zhu, Yulan; Yao, Lifen; Lian, Yajun; Zhu, Yanmei; Zhang, Min; Dai, Yuwei; Wang, Kang; Han, Xiong; Li, Ling; Zhang, Lifang; Xu, Huiqing; Yao, Dongai; Luo, Xinmin; Jiang, Wen; Wang, Xiahong; Zhao, Chuansheng; Chen, Yangmei; Deng, Xuejun; Liu, Chaorong; Feng, Li; Song, Yanmin; Wu, Yuan; Liao, Weiping; Wang, Furong; Zhu, Suiqiang; Xiao, Bo; Wang, Qun; Long, Lili",Seizure,,470

470458,Prioritizing otological surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"In a rare neurologic disease known as IgM monoclonal gammopathy the immune system targets a sulfated trisaccharide known as the Human Natural Killer-1 (HNK-1) epitope that comprises a constituent of the myelin sheath known as MAG (myelin-associated glycoprotein). This Editorial highlights a study by Aliu and colleagues in the current issue of the Journal of Neurochemistry, in which the investigators constructed a biodegradable poly-l-lysine backbone with multiple copies of this sulfated HNK-1 trisaccharide. This decoy, poly(phenyl disodium 3-O-sulfo-ß-d-glucopyranuronate)-(1â3)-ß-d-galactopyranoside, known as PPSGG, removed anti-MAG IgM autoantibodies from the blood, while not activating the immune system. These findings provide a path for the selective removal of a pathogenic set of antibodies that target the myelin sheath resulting in neuropathy. These findings are applicable to a parallel strategy for the generation of polysaccharides similar to those present in the receptor-binding domain of CoViD-19, which might inhibit viral adhesion to its receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein, thereby impairing cellular uptake of the virus itself. The deployment of complex polysaccharides that mimic actual COVID19 polysaccharides on the spike protein may also provide a feasible structural basis for a vaccine. Carbohydrate mimics, if conjugated to a carrier or backbone, might provoke an immune response to the spike protein. A vaccine that targets critical carbohydrates on COVID19, and then neutralizes the virus would recapitulate a successful strategy employed in other microbial vaccines, like the pneumococcal vaccines and the meningococcal vaccines. These vaccines direct an immune response to complex carbohydrates and successfully prevent life-threatening disease. This paper provides lessons from a rare neurologic disease that may teach us strategies applicable to a global pandemic.","Steinman, Lawrence",J Neurochem,,470

Subjects presented mild symptoms in 79% (95%CI 65-91%; I2 = 93.5%) of cases, whereas only 4% (95%CI 1-9%; I2 = 76.4%) were critical. Among those with pneumonia on computed tomography, 26.4% (95%CI 13-41%; I2 = 80.8%) presented a unilateral involvement, 16% (95%CI 5-29%, I2 = 81.2%) had bilateral involvement and 9% (95%CI 0-24%; I2 = 88.7%) had interstitial pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Children and/or adolescents tend to have a mild COVID-19 course with a good prognosis. IMPACT: Compared to adults, children and/or adolescents tend to have a mild COVID-19 course with a good prognosis.This study provides new and consistence information on the clinical and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 in pediatrics.This study may help to fight COVID-19 in pediatric population.","Mantovani, Alessandro; Rinaldi, Elisabetta; Zusi, Chiara; Beatrice, Giorgia; Saccomani, Marco Deganello; Dalbeni, Andrea",Pediatr. res,,470

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children is typically minimally symptomatic. We report a series of febrile pediatric patients with acute heart failure potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. METHODS: Over a 2-month period, contemporary with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France and Switzerland, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, therapeutic, and early outcomes data in children who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in 14 centers for cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction, and severe inflammatory state. RESULTS: Thirty-five children were identified and included in the study. Median age at admission was 10 years (range, 2-16 years). Comorbidities were present in 28%, including asthma and overweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent. Left ventricular ejection fraction was <30% in one-third; 80% required inotropic support with 28% treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Inflammation markers were suggestive of cytokine storm (interleukin-6 median, 135 pg/mL) and macrophage activation (D-dimer median, 5284 ng/mL). Mean BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) was elevated (5743 pg/mL). Thirty-one of 35 patients (88%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swab or serology. All patients received intravenous immunoglobulin, with adjunctive steroid therapy used in one-third. Left ventricular function was restored in the 25 of 35 of those discharged from the intensive care unit. No patient died, and all patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were successfully weaned. CONCLUSIONS: Children may experience an acute cardiac decompensation caused by severe inflammatory state after SARS-CoV-2 infection (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children). Treatment with immunoglobulin appears to be associated with recovery of left ventricular systolic function.","Belhadjer, Zahra; Méot, Mathilde; Bajolle, Fanny; Khraiche, Diala; Legendre, Antoine; Abakka, Samya; Auriau, Johanne; Grimaud, Marion; Oualha, Mehdi; Beghetti, Maurice; Wacker, Julie; Ovaert, Caroline; Hascoet, Sebastien; Selegny, Maëlle; Malekzadeh-Milani, Sophie; Maltret, Alice; Bosser, Gilles; Giroux, Nathan; Bonnemains, Laurent; Bordet, Jeanne; Di Filippo, Sylvie; Mauran, Pierre; Falcon-Eicher, Sylvie; Thambo, Jean-Benoît; Lefort, Bruno; Moceri, Pamela; Houyel, Lucile; Renolleau, Sylvain; Bonnet, Damien",Circulation,,470
473132,Effects of home confinement due to COVID-19 pandemic on eccentric hamstring muscle strength in football players,2020,"Background: Echinochrome A (EchA) is a pigment from sea urchins. EchA is a polyhydroxylated 1,4-naphthoquinone that contains several hydroxyl groups appropriate for free-radical scavenging and preventing redox imbalance. EchA is the most studied molecule of this family and is an active principle approved to be used in humans, usually for cardiopathies and glaucoma. EchA is used as a pharmaceutical drug. Methods: A comprehensive literature and patent search review was undertaken using PubMed, as well as Google Scholar and Espacenet search engines to review these areas. Conclusions: In the bloodstream, EchA can mediate cellular responses, act as a radical scavenger, and activate the glutathione pathway. It decreases ROS imbalance, prevents and limits lipid peroxidation, and enhances mitochondrial functions. Most importantly, EchA contributes to the modulation of the immune system. EchA can regulate the generation of regulatory T cells, inhibit pro-inflammatory IL-1ß and IL-6 cytokine production, while slightly reducing IL-8, TNF-&#945;, INF-&#945;, and NKT, thus correcting immune imbalance. These characteristics suggest that EchA is a candidate drug to alleviate the cytokine storm syndrome (CSS).","Rubilar, Tamara; Barbieri, Elena S; Gazquez, Ayelén; Avaro, Marisa",Mar. drugs,,470

473761,"Increases in Risky Drinking During the COVID-19 Pandemic Assessed via Longitudinal Cohort Design: Associations With Racial Tensions, Financial Distress, Psychological Distress and Virus-Related Fears",2021,"Global shifts toward a disease-oriented, vertical approach to health has involved limiting the right for communities to participate in decision-making. Ecuador's authoritarian legacy has forced civil society and social organizations to adopt 'coping strategies', while large protests recently derived into violent struggles. The country has been severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic amid corruption scandals involving hospital and food purchases by government during the response. This study critically examines how Ecuador's government took into consideration 'community participation' as a value and tenet of health promotion. Our systematic textual analysis focuses on 53 consecutive resolutions by the National Emergency Operations Committee (EOC) leading the decision-making processes, which, explicitly requires community participation. Results show that the 'lifecycle' of the central government's evolving policy framing centered on law enforcement and the private sector, followed by the social sector. Further, there is no evidence of stakeholders from civil society or organizations taking part in decision-making. Having legitimized the exclusion of community participation in Ecuador's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that the government will fail to consider the wider social implications of its impact. In particular, the limits to local governments becoming informed and making decisions without mediation by the National EOC will further impede community participation in health decision-making in the future. This implies that local knowledge and experiences will also not inform health policy.","Torres, Irene; López-Cevallos, Daniel",Health promot. internation,,470

474029,The self-coping method in online psychological aid at COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically challenged the national health systems worldwide in the last months. Dalbavancin is a novel antibiotic with a long plasmatic half-life and simplified weekly administration regimens, thus representing a promising option for the outpatient treatment of Gram-positive infections and the early discharge of hospitalized patients. Dalbavancin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs). Many preliminary data seem to support its use in other indications, such as osteomyelitis, prosthetic joint infections, and infective endocarditis. AREAS COVERED: A search in the literature using validated keywords (dalbavancin, Gram-positive infections, Gram-positive cocci, ABSSSI, intravenous treatment, and long-acting antibiotics) was conducted on biomedical bibliographic databases (PubMed and Embase) from 2004 to 30 September 2020. Results were analyzed during two consensus conferences with the aim to review the current evidence on dalbavancin in Gram-positive infections, mainly ABSSSI, osteomyelitis, and infective endocarditis, highlight the main limitations of available studies and suggest possible advantages of the molecule. EXPERT OPINION: The board identifies some specific subgroups of patients with ABSSSIs who could mostly benefit from a treatment with dalbavancin and agrees that the design of homogenous and robust studies would allow a broader use of dalbavancin even in other clinical settings.","Andreoni, Massimo; Bassetti, Matteo; Corrao, Salvatore; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Esposito, Vincenzo; Falcone, Marco; Grossi, Paolo; Pea, Federico; Petrosillo, Nicola; Tascini, Carlo; Venditti, Mario; Viale, Pierluigi",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,,470

476072,Impact of COVID-19 infection control measures on influenza-related outcomes in Hong Kong,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic increases the demand for postacute care in patients after a severe disease course. Various long-term sequelae are expected and rehabilitation medicine is challenged to support physical and cognitive recovery. AIM: We aimed to explore the dysfunctions and outcome of COVID-19 survivors after early postacute rehabilitation. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. METHODS: This study evaluated the postacute sequelae of patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection and analyzed rehabilitative outcomes of a subgroup of patients included in the prospective observational multicenter CovILD study. RESULTS: A total of 23 subjects discharged after severe to critical COVID-19 infection underwent an individualized, multiprofessional rehabilitation. At the start of postacute rehabilitation, impairment of pulmonary function (87%), symptoms related to postintensive care syndrome, and neuropsychological dysfunction (85%) were frequently found, whereas cardiac function appeared to be largely unaffected. Of interest, multi-disciplinary rehabilitation resulted in a significant improvement in lung function, as reflected by an increase of forced vital capacity (P=0.007) and forced expiratory volume in one second (P=0.014), total lung capacity (P=0.003), and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (P=0.002). Accordingly, physical performance status significantly improved as reflected by a mean increase of six-minute walking distance by 176 (SD±137) meters. Contrarily, a considerable proportion of patients still had limited diffusion capacity (83%) or neurological symptoms including peripheral neuropathy at the end of rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals discharged after a severe course of COVID-19 frequently present with persisting physical and cognitive dysfunctions after hospital discharge. Those patients significantly benefit from multi-disciplinary inpatient rehabilitation. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Our data demonstrated the highly promising effects of early postacute rehabilitation in survivors of severe or critical COVID-19. This findings urge further prospective evaluations and may impact future treatment and rehabilitation strategies.","Puchner, Bernhard; Sahanic, Sabina; Kirchmair, Rudolf; Pizzini, Alex; Sonnweber, Bettina; Wöll, Ewald; Mühlbacher, Andreas; Garimorth, Katja; Dareb, Bernhard; Ehling, Rainer; Wenter, Johanna; Schneider, Sybille; Brenneis, Christian; Weiss, Günter; Tancevski, Ivan; Sonnweber, Thomas; Löffler-Ragg, Judith",Eur J Phys Rehabil Med,,470

A specific adaptation of the Shewhart p-chart, called a funnel chart, was used to compare case fatality rates. Important differences in case fatality rates across the counties did not appear to be reflective of differences in testing or incidence rates. Instead, a higher prevalence of comorbidities and vulnerabilities was observed in high fatality rate counties, while showing no differences in access to acute care. Funnel charts reliably identify counties with unexpected high and low COVID-19 case fatality rates. Social determinants of health are strongly associated with such differences. These data may assist in public health decisions including vaccination strategies, especially in southern states with similar demographics.","Velayati, Arash; Dahale, Devesh; Dahlin, Arielle; Hamilton, Caleb; Provost, Lloyd P; Erwin, Paul",J Public Health Manag Pract,,470

Interpretation of results generated by different platforms and prioritization for testing algorithms required cross-comparison. OBJECTIVE.­: To compare the analytical sensitivity of 3 commercial SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays, selected samples were studied in parallel with Cobas SARS-CoV-2 test, NxTAG CoV Extended Panel, and ID NOW COVID-19 assays. DESIGN.­: A total of 8043 SARS-CoV-2 tests performed from March 22 to April 19, 2020, were included in this study. For all 1794 positive specimens detected by the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay, the cycle threshold (Ct) values were manually tracked and plotted to demonstrate the distribution of sample viral levels. Additionally, 50 and 63 low-positive specimens (Ct values >32) as well as 50 and 61 consecutive positive specimens by the cobas assay were tested with NxTAG and ID NOW, respectively, to estimate their relative sensitivities. RESULTS.­: The Ct values of cobas SARS-CoV-2-positive samples were evenly distributed throughout ranges of 13.32 to 39.50 (mean, 25.06) and 13.60 to 42.49 (mean, 26.45) for ORF1 and E gene targets, respectively. NxTAG reliably detected only specimens with E gene Ct values lower than 33, and is estimated to detect 89.4% of positive specimens detected by cobas assay. ID NOW had performance variation independent of Ct value and is estimated to detect 83.5% of cobas positives. CONCLUSIONS.­: Clinical specimens exhibit a wide range of viral burden, with a significant portion at low levels. Analytical sensitivity of testing platforms is critical for reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 and uniform care to patients.","Jin, Run; Pettengill, Matthew A; Hartnett, Nicole L; Auerbach, Herbert E; Peiper, Stephen C; Wang, Zixuan",Arch Pathol Lab Med,,470
477674,The psychological impact of fertility treatment suspensions during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Objective: To describe the impact a global pandemic has had on a teaching movement disorders program, as well as its subsequent transition to telemedicine. Methods: In the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we transitioned our movement disorders fellowship program virtually over the course of a few days. Here we describe the parameters used for the telemedicine fellow supervised clinic visit over the course of 2 months. Fellow's input was obtained from a brief survey at the end of the experience. Faculty's experience was collected upon independent faculty discussions. We also summarize the challenges and advantages of this teaching experience and its downsides. Results: A total of 130 patients (102 follow-up and 28 new patients) were seen over 22 clinic days with any of our 3 fellows being supervised by 1 of the 6 attending physicians. The main challenges were related to technical difficulties and lack of portions of the examination such as tone, reflexes, and sensory testing. The main advantages were related to increased patient access and a decrease in scheduling barriers. The overall satisfaction with the experience of the fellows was positive (69%). Conclusions: This sample shows the feasibility (despite lack of prior experience) of virtual clinical supervision of movement disorders fellows for follow-up and new complex patient encounters. This novel method for movement disorders training has implications for training locally, nationally, and internationally. Limitations and possible future directions such as the inclusion of nonsynchronous recordings and devices for tone and balance testing are also discussed.","Suarez-Cedeno, Gerson; Pantelyat, Alexander; Mils, Kelly; Murthy, Maitreiyi; Alshaikh, Jumana; Rosenthal, Liana; Bang, Jee; Moukheiber, Emile",Telemed. j. e. health,,470

Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 - part of the family members (first-generation) who had exposure history and others (second-generation) infected through them, and Group 2 - patients from the same family having identical exposure history. We collected clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) features for each patient. Comparison tests were performed between the first- and second-generation patients in Group 1. RESULTS: In total there were 21 patients in Group 1 and 20 patients in Group 2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional follow-up study is a sequel to a study by Biadsee et al. Among the previous study population of 128 non-hospitalized patients, positive for COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 97 patients participated in a survey designed for this study. Information and data regarding loss of smell and taste, rate of recovery, xerostomia, and additional symptoms; (Cough, Myalgia, Weakness, Rhinorrhea, Nasal congestion) were collected. RESULTS: A total of 43 men and 54 women were included. Mean age was 37.5 years (range 19-74). Mean follow-up was 229 days (range 191-253). Sixty-five patients reported gustatory dysfunction during the disease of which 61.5% reported full recovery, 38.5% partial recovery. Of 65 patients who reported olfactory impairment during the disease, 52% had full recovery and 48% reported partial recovery of olfactory function. Complete recovery of olfactory function was positively associated with full recovery of gustatory function (p = 0.01). Gender did not significantly affect the recovery of OD and GD (p = 0.45, p = 0.90, respectively). Patients who experienced olfactory dysfunction as an initial symptom had lower rates of olfactory complete recovery (p = 0.043). CONCLUSION: After a mean follow-up of 229 days, complete recovery of smell and taste functions occurred in 52% and 61.5%, respectively. However, dysfunction persisted in 48%-38.5% of patients.","Biadsee, Ameen; Dagan, Or; Ormianer, Zeev; Kassem, Firas; Masarwa, Shchada; Biadsee, Ameer",Am J Otolaryngol,,470

480388,Return to Work in COVID-19: Review of Current Guidelines,2020,"A pandemic caused by the COVID-19 has caused disorders and enormous damage in all modes of transport. Carriers as well as transport users have faced great challenges of maintaining traffic. Measures and requirements imposed on them were often obscure, imprecise, and the journey itself was uncertain. Passengers were in fear of whether they would be able to reach their destination, but also whether they will succeed in preserving their health. Carriers, on the other hand, have also sought to adapt and provide passengers with safe transport. Nevertheless, the pandemic caused financial collapse of many carriers, landed the world fleet and closed many airports. Various legal instruments related to the protection of public health are applied in air transport, and they have been adopted within the framework of the World Health Organisation (WHO), the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which will be presented in the paper. Various epidemiological measures related to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic have been prescribed in air transport, applicable during the journey, which have certain specifics in relation to other modes of transport. The paper will present epidemiological measures as well as the procedure applied when there is a passenger on the flight who shows symptoms of an infectious disease, and new procedures related to transport of goods. It will also address the obligation to complete certain forms and provide various information as well as the obligation to compensate costs for cancelled flights. There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has a significant economic impact on air transport, and efforts will be made to present measures and provide forecasts for the recovery of air traffic in the period that follows. The paper will also address the question as to whether existing legislation and measures are appropriate, whether relevant international organisations have taken prompt measures to protect and ensure air transport during the pandemic, and whether sufficient measures have been taken to protect the health of passengers on the flight.","Vasilj, Aleksandra PhD Full Professor Erceg Biljana Činčurak PhD Assistant Professor Perković Aleksandra bacc admin publ Head of Cabin Crew",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,,470

480460,An appropriate and reactive response to the repeated waves of the COVID-19 pandemic by the national medico-psychological network (CUMP) in France,2021,"Graph neural networks, trained on experimental or calculated data are becoming an increasingly important tool in computational materials science. Networks, once trained, are able to make highly accurate predictions at a fraction of the cost of experiments or first-principles calculations of comparable accuracy. However these networks typically rely on large databases of labelled experiments to train the model. In scenarios where data is scarce or expensive to obtain this can be prohibitive. By building a neural network that provides a confidence on the predicted properties, we are able to develop an active learning scheme that can reduce the amount of labelled data required, by identifying the areas of chemical space where the model is most uncertain. We present a scheme for coupling a graph neural network with a Gaussian process to featurise solid-state materials and predict properties \textit{including} a measure of confidence in the prediction. We then demonstrate that this scheme can be used in an active learning context to speed up the training of the model, by selecting the optimal next experiment for obtaining a data label. Our active learning scheme can double the rate at which the performance of the model on a test data set improves with additional data compared to choosing the next sample at random. This type of uncertainty quantification and active learning has the potential to open up new areas of materials science, where data are scarce and expensive to obtain, to the transformative power of graph neural networks.","Allotey, Johannes; Butler, Keith T.; Thiyagalingam, Jeyan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02077v2.pdf,470

In Japan, remdesivir was approved in May 2020 for COVID-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In February 2021, a vaccine against COVID-19 was approved. These two approvals were made using the Special Approval for Emergency system in Japan. This Japanese system was started in 2010 and has been used to approve four drugs to date, including remdesivir and the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. This paper discusses future challenges for Japan's Special Approval for Emergency system and organizes what can be learned from experiences to date. As a result, I would like to point Out the following issues. (i) Special Approval for Emergency is a system for approving drugs approved overseas, not a system for approving drugs originally developed in Japan. A system to approve drugs that have not been approved in foreign countries needs to be considered. (ii) In the Special Approval for Emergency system, it is necessary to ensure that postmarketing activities are conducted in accordance with the Risk Management Plan and the conditions of approval, to disclose the results in a timely and speedy manner, and to judge the appropriateness of continued approval based on the results of postmarketing activities.","Maeda, Hideki",Clin. pharmacol. ther,,470

While there have been several reviews published on COVID-19 and population health disparities generally-including some with attention to HIV-none has focused on sexual health (ie, STI care, female sexual health, sexual behaviour). We have conducted a scoping review focused on sexual health (excluding reproductive health (RH), intimate partner violence (IPV) and gender-based violence (GBV)) in the COVID-19 era, examining sexual behaviours and sexual health outcomes. METHODS: A scoping review, compiling both peer-reviewed and grey literature, focused on sexual health (excluding RH, IPV and GBV) and COVID-19 was conducted on 15 September 2020. Multiple bibliographical databases were searched. Study selection conformed to Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Reviewers' Manual 2015 Methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews. We only included English-language original studies. RESULTS: We found that men who have sex with men may be moving back toward pre-pandemic levels of sexual activity, and that STI and HIV testing rates seem to have decreased. There was minimal focus on outcomes such as the economic impact on sexual health (excluding RH, IPV and GBV) and STI care, especially STI care of marginalised populations. In terms of population groups, there was limited focus on sex workers or on women, especially women's sexual behaviour and mental health. We noticed limited use of qualitative techniques. Very few studies were in low/middle-income countries (LMICs). CONCLUSIONS: Sexual health research is critical during a global infectious disease pandemic and our review of studies suggested notable research gaps. Researchers can focus efforts on LMICs and under-researched topics within sexual health and explore the use of qualitative techniques and interventions where appropriate.","Kumar, Navin; Janmohamed, Kamila; Nyhan, Kate; Forastiere, Laura; Zhang, Wei-Hong; Kågesten, Anna; Uhlich, Maximiliane; Sarpong Frimpong, Afia; Van de Velde, Sarah; Francis, Joel M; Erausquin, Jennifer Toller; Larrson, Elin; Callander, Deton; Scott, John; Minichiello, Victor; Tucker, Joseph",Sex. transm. infect,,470

A total of 1424 human cell membrane proteins were predicted to constitute the receptorome of the human-infecting virome. In addition, the combination of the random-forest model with protein-protein interactions between human and viruses predicted in previous studies enabled further prediction of the receptors for 693 human-infecting viruses, such as the enterovirus, norovirus and West Nile virus.

Drawing upon Singer and Clair's syndemics model, I focus on synergistic interaction among chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, and COVID-19 in Pakistan. I argue that over 36 million people in Pakistan are standing at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, developing severe complications, and losing their lives. These two diseases, but several other socio-cultural, economic, and political factors contributing to structured vulnerabilities, would function as confounders. To deal with the critical effects of these syndemics the government needs appropriate policies and their implementation during the pandemic and post-pandemic.

Researchers herein try to determine the influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). Influenza VE depends on the vaccinated personal characteristics and the closeness of matching between the vaccine and the prevalent strains of the virus. The aim of our research was to identify the 2018-2019 seasonal influenza VE in HCWs. METHODS: a record-based study was carried out using the test-negative design from October 2018 to September 2019 to calculate the influenza VE. HCWs with influenza like illness (ILI) were screened to detect the positive cases, and the vaccination status was determined based on vaccination database. VE was assessed from the ratio of the odds of vaccination among positive cases to the odds of vaccination among negative controls. Statistical analysis Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted VE. RESULTS: a total of 556 HCWs presented with ILI, 65.6% were females, and 54.1% were nurses, 152 HCWs (27.3%) had laboratory-confirmed influenza, shows two peaks in January and March 2019. VE for all types was 35.0% and rose to 42.0% after adjustment for HCWs age, gender, nationality, and job position, influenza A (H3N2) VE was 78.0%. H1N1 VE was 55.0% but no significant VE for type B was found. CONCLUSION: Our VE estimates are in agreement with VE estimates published for that season.

AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review aims to discuss the current status concerning the taxonomy, ethnobotanical uses, phytochemistry and biological properties of species which compose the subtribe Hyptidinae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The available information was collected from scientific databases (ScienceDirect, Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, ChemSpider, SciFinder ACS Publications, Wiley Online Library), as well as other literature sources (e.g. books, theses). RESULTS: The phytochemical investigations of plants of this subtribe have led to the identification of almost 300 chemical constituents of different classes such as diterpenes, triterpenes, lignans, &#945;-pyrones, flavonoids, phenolic acids and monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, as components of essential oils. Extracts, essential oils and isolated compounds showed a series of biological activities such as insecticide/repellent, antimicrobial and antinociceptive, justifying some of the popular uses of the plants. In addition, a very relevant fact is that several species produce podophyllotoxin and related lignans. CONCLUSION: Several species of Hyptidinae are used in folk medicine for treating many diseases but only a small fraction of the species has been explored and most of the traditional uses have not been validated by current investigations. In addition, the species of the subtribe appears to be very promising, as alternative sources of podophyllotoxin-like lignans which are the lead compounds for the semi-synthesis of teniposide and etoposide, important antineoplastic agents. Thus, there is a wide-open door for future studies, both to support the popular uses of the plants and to find new biologically active compounds in this large number of species not yet explored.","Bridi, Henrique; de Carvalho Meirelles, Gabriela; Lino von Poser, Gilsane",J Ethnopharmacol,,470
486848,The Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak on the Household Economy,2020,"Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 19 April 2020: notifications = 6,606; deaths = 69. The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of the disease. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked. The distribution of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.0%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (6.8%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (4.7%) and the United Kingdom (13.5%). The low CFR is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases. High case ascertainment enables public health response and reduction of disease transmission. Internationally, cases continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained. Interpretation of international epidemiology should be conducted with caution as it differs from country to country depending not only on the disease dynamics, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures.",,,,470
487215,Exploratory study on the psychological impact of COVID-19 on the general Brazilian population,2021,"Safety of healthcare workers in hospitals is a major concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being exposed for several working hours per day to infected patients, nurses dealing with COVID-19 face several issues that lead to physical/psychological breakdown. This study focused on burnout and its associated factors in nurses working in an Italian University Hospital during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. We designed a web-based cross-sectional study addressed to nurses working at the University Hospital in Foggia, Italy. The online questionnaire was organized in sections aimed at collecting demographic and occupational variables, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OBI). Two hundred and ninety-three nurses agreed to participate. According to MBI, we reported moderate/high emotional exhaustion in 76.5%, depersonalization in 50.2%, and personal gratification in 54.6% of participants. COVID-19-related burnout measured by OBI resulted medium/high in 89.1% of participants. Among demographic and occupational factors, a multivariate regression analysis identified emotional support, consideration of leaving job, and workload as predictive of burnout in nurses. In conclusion, this study suggests that the improvement of employer and family support to nurses, as well as reduction of workload and job-related stress, would contribute to reducing burnout in nurses during COVID-19 pandemics.","Bellanti, Francesco; Lo Buglio, Aurelio; Capuano, Erika; Dobrakowski, Michal; Kasperczyk, Aleksandra; Kasperczyk, Slawomir; Ventriglio, Antonio; Vendemiale, Gianluigi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,470

As uncertainty existed regarding patient's outcomes, early guidelines recommended against establishing new ECMO centers. We aimed to explore the epidemiology and outcomes of ECMO for COVID-19 related cardiopulmonary failure in five countries in the Middle East and India and to evaluate the results of ECMO in 5 new centers. METHODS: This is a retrospective, multicenter international, observational study conducted in 19 ECMO centers in five countries in the Middle East and India from March 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020. We included patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO for refractory hypoxemia and severe respiratory acidosis with or without circulatory failure. Data collection included demographic data, ECMO-related specific data, pre-ECMO patient condition, 24 h post-ECMO initiation data, and outcome. The primary outcome was survival to home discharge. Secondary outcomes included mortality during ECMO, survival to decannulation, and outcomes stratified by center type. RESULTS: Three hundred and seven COVID-19 patients received ECMO support during the study period, of whom 78 (25%) were treated in the new ECMO centers. The median age was 45 years (interquartile range IQR 37-52), and 81% were men. New center patients were younger, were less frequently male, had received higher PEEP, more frequently inotropes and prone positioning before ECMO and were less frequently retrieved from a peripheral center on ECMO. Survival to home discharge was 45%. In patients treated in new and established centers, survival was 55 and 41% (p = 0.03), respectively. Multivariable analysis retained only a SOFA score < 12 at ECMO initiation as associated with survival (odds ratio, OR 1.93 (95% CI 1.05-3.58), p = 0.034), but not treatment in a new center (OR 1.65 (95% CI 0.75-3.67)). CONCLUSIONS: During pandemics, ECMO may provide favorable outcomes in highly selected patients as resources allow. Newly formed ECMO centers with appropriate supervision of regional experts may have satisfactory results.","Rabie, Ahmed A; Azzam, Mohamed H; Al-Fares, Abdulrahman A; Abdelbary, Akram; Mufti, Hani N; Hassan, Ibrahim F; Chakraborty, Arpan; Oza, Pranay; Elhazmi, Alyaa; Alfoudri, Huda; Pooboni, Suneel Kumar; Alharthy, Abdulrahman; Brodie, Daniel; Zakhary, Bishoy; Shekar, Kiran; Antonini, Marta Velia; Barrett, Nicholas A; Peek, Giles; Combes, Alain; Arabi, Yaseen M",Intensive Care Med,,470

487744,#StayHomeStayFit: UNIMI's approach to online healthy lifestyle promotion during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Aside from primary vestibular symptoms such as vertigo and dizziness, persons with vestibular dysfunction frequently express cognitive and motor problems. These symptoms have mainly been assessed in single-task setting, which might not represent activities of daily living accurately. Therefore, a dual-task protocol, consisting of the simultaneous performance of cognitive and motor tasks, was developed. This protocol assesses cognitive and motor performance in general, as well as cognitive-motor interference in specific. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The motor component of the 2BALANCE protocol consists of a static and dynamic postural task. These motor tasks are combined with different cognitive tasks assessing visuospatial cognition, processing speed, working memory and response inhibition. First, test-retest reliability will be assessed with an interval of 2 weeks in a group of young adults. Second, the 2BALANCE protocol will be validated in persons with bilateral vestibulopathy. Finally, the protocol will be implemented in persons with unilateral vestibular loss. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The 2BALANCE project aims to elucidate the impact of vestibular dysfunction on cognitive and motor performance in dual-task setting. This protocol represents everyday situations better than single-task protocols, as dual-tasks such as reading street signs while walking are often encountered during daily activities. Ultimately, this project could enable individualised and holistic clinical care in these patients, taking into account single as well as dual-task performance. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The current study was approved by the ethics committee of Ghent University Hospital on 5 July 2019 with registration number B670201940465. All research findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at vestibular as well as multidisciplinary international conferences and meetings.

488502,Bioethical problems in the provision of nursing care during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Repurposed medicines may have a role against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The antiparasitic ivermectin, with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, has now been tested in numerous clinical trials. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: We assessed the efficacy of ivermectin treatment in reducing mortality, in secondary outcomes, and in chemoprophylaxis, among people with, or at high risk of, COVID-19 infection. DATA SOURCES: We searched bibliographic databases up to April 25, 2021. Two review authors sifted for studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted and certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach and additionally in trial sequential analyses for mortality. Twenty-four randomized controlled trials involving 3406 participants met review inclusion. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Meta-analysis of 15 trials found that ivermectin reduced risk of death compared with no ivermectin (average risk ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.73; n = 2438; I2 = 49%; moderate-certainty evidence). This result was confirmed in a trial sequential analysis using the same DerSimonian-Laird method that underpinned the unadjusted analysis. This was also robust against a trial sequential analysis using the Biggerstaff-Tweedie method. Low-certainty evidence found that ivermectin prophylaxis reduced COVID-19 infection by an average 86% (95% confidence interval 79%-91%). Secondary outcomes provided less certain evidence. Low-certainty evidence suggested that there may be no benefit with ivermectin for ""need for mechanical ventilation,"" whereas effect estimates for ""improvement"" and ""deterioration"" clearly favored ivermectin use. Severe adverse events were rare among treatment trials and evidence of no difference was assessed as low certainty. Evidence on other secondary outcomes was very low certainty. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-certainty evidence finds that large reductions in COVID-19 deaths are possible using ivermectin. Using ivermectin early in the clinical course may reduce numbers progressing to severe disease. The apparent safety and low cost suggest that ivermectin is likely to have a significant impact on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic globally.","Bryant, Andrew; Lawrie, Theresa A; Dowswell, Therese; Fordham, Edmund J; Mitchell, Scott; Hill, Sarah R; Tham, Tony C",Am J Ther,,470

METHODS: To explore the efficacy and safety of Reduning injection in the treatment of COVID-19, a randomized, open-labeled, multicenter, controlled trial was conducted from 12 general hospitals between 2020.02.06 and 2020.03.23. Patients with COVID-19 who met the diagnostic criteria of the ""Diagnosis and Treatment Program for Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia (Trial Fifth Edition)"". Patients were randomized to routine treatment with or without Reduning injection (20 mL/day for 14 days) (ChiCTR2000029589). The primary endpoint was the rate of achieving clinical symptom recovery on day 14 of treatment. RESULTS: There were 77 and 80 participants in the Reduning and control groups. The symptom resolution rate at 14 days was higher in the Reduning injection than in controls [full-analysis set (FAS): 84.4% vs. 60.0%, P=0.0004].

To assess the ecological risk of azoxystrobin in real soil environments, we performed a study on the toxic effects of azoxystrobin on earthworms (Eisenia fetida) in three different natural soils (fluvo-aquic soil, black soil and red clay soil) and an artificial soil. Acute toxicity of azoxystrobin was determined by filter paper test and soil test. Accordingly, exposure concentrations of chronic toxicity were set at 0, 0.1, 1.0 and 2.5 mg kg-1. For chronic toxicity test, reactive oxygen species, activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase), detoxifying enzyme (glutathione transferase), level of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) and level of oxygen damage of DNA (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine) in earthworms were determined on the 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 42nd and 56th days after treatment. Both acute and chronic toxic results showed azoxystrobin exhibit higher toxicity in natural soil than in artificial soil, indicating that traditional artificial soil testing method underestimate ecotoxicity of azoxystrobin in a real agricultural environment on the earthworm population. Combining with the analysis of soil physicochemical properties, the present experiment provided scientific guidance for rational application of azoxystrobin in agricultural production systems.","Xu, Yaqi; Li, Bing; Hou, Kaixuan; Du, Zhongkun; Allen, Samuel C; Zhu, Lusheng; Li, Wenxiu; Zhu, Lei; Wang, Jinhua; Wang, Jun",Environ Res,,470

491184,"COVID-19: the critical balance between appropriate governmental restrictions and expected economic, psychological and social consequences in Italy. Are we going in the right direction?",2020,"The COVID-19 epidemic broke out in Wuhan, Hubei in December 2019 and in January 2020 and was later transmitted to the entire country. Quarantine measures during Chinese New Year effectively alleviated the spread of the epidemic, but they simultaneously resulted in a decline in anthropogenic emissions from industry, transportation, and import and export of goods. Herein, we present the major chemical composition of non-refractory PM2.5 (NR-PM2.5) and the concentrations of gaseous pollutants in an urban site in Shanghai before and during the quarantine period of the COVID-19 epidemic, which was Jan. 8-23 and Jan. 24-Feb. 8, respectively. The observed results show that the reduction in PM2.5 can be mainly attributed to decreasing concentrations of nitrate and primary aerosols. Nitrate accounted for 37% of NR-PM2.5 before the quarantine period when there was no emission reduction. During the quarantine period, the nitrate concentration decreased by approximately 60%, which is attributed to a reduction in the NOx concentration. Ammonium, as the main balancing cation, showed an approximately 45% simultaneous decrease in concentration. The concentrations of chloride and hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols from primary emissions also declined due to limited human activities. By contrast, sulphate and oxygenated organic aerosols showed a slight decrease in concentration, with their contributions increasing to 27% and 18%, respectively, during the quarantine period, which resulted in two pollution episodes with PM2.5 exceeding 100 µg/m3. This study provides a better understanding of the impact of quarantine measures on variations of the PM2.5 concentration and chemical compositions. Atmospheric oxidation capacities based on the oxidant (Ox = O3 + NO2) and oxidation ratios have been discussed for elucidating the source and formation of haze in an environment with lower anthropogenic emissions. With increasing contribution of secondary aerosols, lower NOx and nitrate concentrations did not completely avoid haze in Shanghai during the epidemic.","Chen, Hui; Huo, Juntao; Fu, Qingyan; Duan, Yusen; Xiao, Hang; Chen, Jianmin",Sci Total Environ,,470

In Survey 1, pet owners (n = 686) responded during the final week of the five-week Alert Level 4 lockdown (highest level of restrictions-April 2020), and survey 2 involved 498 respondents during July 2020 whilst at Alert Level 1 (lowest level of restrictions). During the lockdown, 54.7% of owners felt that their pets' wellbeing was better than usual, while only 7.4% felt that it was worse. Most respondents (84.0%) could list at least one benefit of lockdown for their pets, and they noted pets were engaged with more play (61.7%) and exercise (49.7%) than pre-lockdown. Many respondents (40.3%) expressed that they were concerned about their pet's wellbeing after lockdown, with pets missing company/attention and separation anxiety being major themes. In Survey 2, 27.9% of respondents reported that they continued to engage in increased rates of play with their pets after lockdown, however, the higher levels of pet exercise were not maintained. Just over one-third (35.9%) of owners took steps to prepare their pets to transition out of lockdown. The results indicate that pets may have enjoyed improved welfare during lockdown due to the possibility of increased human-pet interaction. The steps taken by owners to prepare animals for a return to normal life may enhance pet wellbeing long-term if maintained.","Esam, Fiona; Forrest, Rachel; Waran, Natalie",,,470

492468,Challenges to Behavioral Health and Injury Surveillance During the COVID-19 Pandemic-Reply,2021,"By calculating the mutual information of stock indexes of 10 primary industry sectors in China, this paper analyzes the dependence relationship among Chinese stock sectors during the COVID-19 and the dynamic evolution of the relationship by using the sliding window method. According to the actual situation of the development of COVID-19 in China, the samples were divided into three stages, namely, calm period, pandemic period, and post-pandemic period. The results show that the dependence relationship among Chinese stock sectors is significantly enhanced in the pandemic period, but it decreases in the post-pandemic period and the dependence structure is similar to that in the calm period. The industrials sector is most closely connected with other sectors in the pandemic period. The information technology sector and telecommunication services sector maintain strong dependence in the three periods and share little contact with other sectors. In the pandemic period, the dependence between the consumer staples sector and other sectors is significantly enhanced, and consumer staples sector and health care sector maintain a strong dependence. From the results of the sliding window, the Chinese stock market is sensitive to the impact of COVID-19, but the duration of the impact on the dependence among the stock sectors is not long.

492728,Impact of the COVID‑19 Pandemic on the Psychosocial Wellbeing of Dental Therapists in Nigeria,2021,"Cardiac arrest is common in critically-ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is associated with poor survival. Simulation is frequently used to evaluate and train code teams with the goal of improving outcomes. All participants engaged in a training on personal protective equipment donning and doffing for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. Thereafter, simulations of in-hospital cardiac-arrest of COVID-19 patients, so-called ""protected code blue"", were conducted at a quaternary academic center. The primary endpoint was the mean time-to-defibrillation. A total of 114 individuals participated in 33 ""protected code blue"" simulations over 8 weeks: 10 were senior residents, 17 were attending physicians, 86 were nurses and 5 were respiratory therapists. Mean time-to defibrillation was 4.38 minutes. Mean time-to-room-entry, time-to-intubation, time-to-first-chest-compression and time-to-epinephrine were 2.77, 5.74, 6.31 and 6.20 minutes respectively. 92.84% of the 16 criteria evaluating the proper management of a COVID-19 cardiac arrest patient were met. Mean time-to-defibrillation was longer than guidelines-expected time during ""protected code blue"" simulations. While adherence to the modified advanced cardiovascular life support protocol was high, breaches that carry an additional infectious risk and reduce the efficacy of the resuscitation team were observed.","Boivin-Proulx, Laurie-Anne; Doherty, Amélie; Rousseau-Saine, Nicolas; Doucet, Serge; Ly, Hung Q; Lavoie, Patrick; Thibodeau-Jarry, Nicolas",Can. j. cardiol,,470
492765,Differential diagnoses in COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective descriptive study,2021,"Since 2014, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has reemerged in Europe. RT-PCR methods have been described for the detection of PEDV, but none have been validated according to a norm. In this study we described the development and validation of a SYBR&#8482; Green one-step RT-qPCR according to the French norm NF U47-600, for the detection and quantification of PEDV viral RNA. The method was validated from sample preparation (feces or jejunum) through to nucleic acid extraction and RT-qPCR detection. Specificity and sensitivity, limit of detection (LoD), limit of quantification (LQ), linearity, intra and inter assay variability were evaluated using transcribed RNA and fecal and jejunum matrices spiked with virus. The analytical and diagnostic specificities and sensitivities of this RT-qPCR were 100% in this study. A LoD of 50 genome copies/5 µl of extract from fecal matrices spiked with virus or RNA transcript and 100 genome copies/5 µl of extract from jejunum matrices spiked with virus were obtained. The Lower LQ (LLQ) was 100 genome copies/5 µl and the Upper LQ (ULQ) 108 copies/5 µl. This method is the first, validated according a norm for PEDV and may serve as a global reference method to harmonize detection and quantification of PEDV viral RNA in both field and experimental settings.","Bigault, Lionel; Brown, Paul; Bernard, Cécilia; Blanchard, Yannick; Grasland, Béatrice",J Virol Methods,,470

However, at the first moments of Pandemic, no information on the matter was known and technologies to fight the Pandemic were not readily available. However, searches in patent databases, if strategically designed, can offer quick responses to new pandemics. OBJECTIVE: Aiming to provide existing information in patent documents useful to develop technologies addressing COVID-19, considering the emergency situation the world was facing and the knowledge of COVID-19 available until April, 2020, this work presents an analysis of the main characteristics of the technological information in patent documents worldwide, related to coronaviruses and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHOD: Regions of concentration of such technologies, the number of available documents and their technological fields are disclosed in three approaches: 1) a wide search, retrieving technologies on SARS or coronaviruses; 2) a targeted search, retrieving documents additionally referring to Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2), which is used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter a cell and 3) a punctual search, which retrieved patents disclosing aspects related to SARS-CoV-2 available at that time. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Results evidence the high-level technology involved in these developments and a monopoly tendency of such technologies, evidencing that it is possible to find answers to new problems in patent documents.","Martins, Tatiana Duque; Cordeiro, Diéricon Sousa",Recent patents on biotechnology (Online),,470

494057,Bayesian Cox Regression for Population-scale Inference in Electronic Health Records,2021-06-18,"INTRODUCTION: The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus virus has altered all facets of clinical practice in the United States. The goal of this study is to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on rhinologic ambulatory and operative practice. METHODS: A 27-item survey to assess these objectives was created and approved by the Division of Rhinology faculty at Rush University Medical Center in April 2020. The survey was then distributed to rhinologists in a web based format via www.surveymonkey.com from April 10 through April 23, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 277 U.S based rhinologists responded to the survey (23.04%). The most common practice types were single specialty private (44.9%) and academic (24.6%). 90.2% practice in a state under a shelter in place order. Comparing pre-COVID baseline to during-COVID, there was statistically significant reduction in the number of patients of seen daily in clinic (p < 0.001). The number of nasal endoscopies in the office and surgical procedures fell dramatically. Overall, 5 respondent rhinologists have been infected with COVID-19 and 27 have been furloughed. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has drastically affected rhinologic practice. There is a dramatic reduction of in person care in the office setting and surgical management of sinonasal and skull base disease. Enhanced PPE is being used in only half of potentially aerosolizing procedures which represents an area of further education. Novel approaches such as use of virtual encounters and point of care testing should be considered as options to facilitate care.","Papagiannopoulos, P; Ganti, A; Kim, Y J; Raad, R A; Kuan, E C; Losavio, P; Tajudeen, B A; Batra, P S",Am J Rhinol Allergy,,470
494402,Determinants of the Covid-19 Pandemic in the West Herzegovina Canton,2020,"BACKGROUND: The effect of extended shift length on pediatric residency is controversial. Israeli residents perform shifts extending up to 26 hours, a practice leading to general dissatisfaction. In early 2020, during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many Israeli hospitals transitioned from 26-hour shifts to 13-hour shifts in fixed teams (capsules) followed by a 24-hour rest period at home. The regulation changes enacted by the Israeli government during the COVID-19 pandemic provided a rare opportunity to assess perception by residents regarding length of shifts before and after the change. OBJECTIVES: To assess perception of pediatric residency in three aspects: resident wellness, ability to deliver quality healthcare, and acquisition of medical education following the change to the shorter shifts model. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study among pediatric residents. Residents completed an online self-assessment questionnaire before and after the COVID-19 emergency regulations changed toward shorter shifts. RESULTS: Sixty-seven residents answered the questionnaires before (37) and after (30) the shift changes. The average score was significantly better for the 13-hour shifts versus the 26-hour shifts, except for questions regarding available time for research. There was a positive perception regarding the shorter night shifts model among pediatric residents, with an increase in general satisfaction and improvement in perception of general wellness, ability to deliver quality healthcare, and medical education acquisition. CONCLUSIONS: Following the change to shorter shift length, perception of pediatric residents included improvement in wellness, ability to deliver quality healthcare, and availability of medical education.","Damari, Eytan; Fargel, Alon; Berger, Itai; Ron, Reut; Yeshayahu, Yonatan",Isr Med Assoc J,,470
494403,Determinants of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the West Herzegovina Canton,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Despite its alarming spread throughout the world, no effective drug and vaccine is discovered for COVID-19 so far. According to WHO, the recovery time from COVID-19 was estimated to be 2 weeks for patients with mild infection, and 3 to 6 weeks for those with serious illnesses. A studies regarding the median recovery time and its predictors are limited globally and specifically in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the median time to recovery from COVID-19 and its predictors among COVID-19 cases admitted to WURH, Western Ethiopian. METHODS: This was a hospital-based retrospective cohort study conducted among 263 adult patients admitted with COVID-19 in WURH treatment center from March 29, 2020 through September 30, 2020. Epidata version 3.2 was used for data entry, and STATA version 14 for analysis. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was fitted to determine factors associated with recovery time. A variable with P-value &#8804; 0.25 at bivariable Cox regression analysis were selected for multivariable Cox proportional model. Multivariable Cox regression model with 95% CI and Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) was used to identify a significant predictor of time to recovery from COVID-19 at P-value < 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of patient was 36.8 (SD± 10.68) years. At the end of follow up, two hundred twenty seven observations were developed an event (recovered) with median time to recovery of 18 days with IQR of 10-27 days. The overall incidence rate of recovery was of 4.38 per 100 (95% CI: 3.84, 4.99) person-days observations. Being older age (AHR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.49), presence of fever on admission (AHR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.21, 2.62), and comorbidity (AHR = 0.56, 95% CI, 0.34, 0.90) were found to have statistically significant association with recovery time. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: In general, the median recovery time of patients with COVID-19 cases was long, and factors such as older age group, presence of fever, and comorbidity was an independent predictors of delayed recovery from COVID-19. Intervention to further reduce recovery time at treatment center has to focus on patients those shows symptoms and with comorbidities.","Tolossa, Tadesse; Wakuma, Bizuneh; Seyoum Gebre, Dejene; Merdassa Atomssa, Emiru; Getachew, Motuma; Fetensa, Getahun; Ayala, Diriba; Turi, Ebisa",PLoS One,,470

I merged 2020 data from the Virginia Department of Health, Google Mobility Reports, and the US Census to estimate a series of 2-way fixed-effect event-study regression models.Results. A stay-at-home order caused people to increase the amount of time spent at home by 12 percentage points and decrease the time the spent at work by 30 percentage points, retail and recreation venues by 40 percentage points, and grocery stores and pharmacies by 10 percentage points. People did not sustain changes in mobility and gradually returned to prepandemic levels before the stay-at-home order was lifted. In areas where people spent the most time at indoor locations, there was a large increase in COVID-19.Conclusions. A more robust and stricter policy response coordinated at the national level combined with a strong economic response from policymakers could have increased the effectiveness of the stay-at-home order.","Murray, Tim",Am J Public Health,,470

497484,Understanding the effects of COVID-19 on the health and safety of immigrant hospitality workers in the United States,2020,"Over the past two decades there has been a number of global outbreaks of viral diseases. This has accelerated the efforts to model and forecast the disease spreading, in order to find ways to confine the spreading regionally and between regions. Towards this we have devised a model of geographical spreading of viral infections due to human spatial mobility and adapted it to the latest COVID-19 pandemic. In this the region to be modelled is overlaid with a two-dimensional grid weighted with the population density defined cells, in each of which a compartmental SEIRS system of delay difference equations simulate the local dynamics (microdynamics) of the disease. The infections between cells are stochastic and allow for the geographical spreading of the virus over the two-dimensional space (macrodynamics). This approach allows to separate the parameters related to the biological aspects of the disease from the ones that represent the spatial contagious behaviour through different kinds of mobility of people acting as virus carriers. These provide sufficient information to trace the evolution of the pandemic in different situations. In particular we have applied this approach to three in many ways different countries, Mexico, Finland and Iceland and found that the model is capable of reproducing and predicting the stochastic global path of the pandemic. This study sheds light on how the diverse cultural and socioeconomic aspects of a country influence the evolution of the epidemics and also the efficacy of social distancing and other confinement measures.","Barrio, Rafael A.; Kaski, Kimmo K.; Haraldsson, Gudmundur G.; Aspelund, Thor; Govezensky, Tzipe",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10806v1.pdf,470
497489,COVID-19 Pandemic effect on Cytopathology Practice: Results from 23 Laboratories in 11 Countries,2020,"Amid COVID-19, there have been rampant increase in the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits by frontline health and sanitation communities, to reduce the likelihoods of infections. The used PPE kits, potentially being infectious, pose a threat to human health, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems, if not scientifically handled and disposed. However, with stressed resources on treatment facilities and lack of training to the health and sanitation workers, it becomes vital to vet different options for PPE kits disposal, to promote environmentally sound management of waste. Given the various technology options available for treatment and disposal of COVID-19 patients waste, Life Cycle Assessment, i.e., cradle to grave analysis of PPE provides essential guidance in identifying the environmentally sound alternatives. In the present work, Life Cycle Assessment of PPE kits has been performed using GaBi version 8.7 under two disposal scenarios, namely landfill and incineration (both centralized and decentralized) for six environmental impact categories covering overall impacts on both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, which includes Global Warming Potential (GWP), Human Toxicity Potential (HTP), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Acidification Potential (AP), Freshwater Aquatic Ecotoxicity Potential (FAETP) and Photochemical Ozone Depletion Potential (POCP). Considering the inventories of PPE kits, disposal of PPE bodysuit has the maximum impact, followed by gloves and goggles, in terms of GWP. The use of metal strips in face-mask has shown the most significant HTP impact. The incineration process (centralized-3816 kg CO2 eq. and decentralized-3813 kg CO2 eq.) showed high GWP but significantly reduced impact w.r.t. AP, EP, FAETP, POCP and HTP, when compared to disposal in a landfill, resulting in the high overall impact of landfill disposal compared to incineration. The decentralized incineration has emerged as environmentally sound management option compared to centralized incinerator among all the impact categories, also the environmental impact by transportation is significant (2.76 kg CO2 eq.) and cannot be neglected for long-distance transportation. Present findings can help the regulatory authority to delineate action steps for safe disposal of PPE kits.","Kumar, Harender; Azad, Amaanuddin; Gupta, Ankit; Sharma, Jitendra; Bherwani, Hemant; Labhsetwar, Nitin Kumar; Kumar, Rakesh",Environ Dev Sustain,,470

While contact tracing only aims to track past activities of infected users, one path to safe reopening is to develop reliable spatiotemporal risk scores to indicate the propensity of the disease. Existing works which aim to develop risk scores either rely on compartmental model-based reproduction numbers (which assume uniform population mixing) or develop coarse-grain spatial scores based on reproduction number (R0) and macro-level density-based mobility statistics. Instead, in this paper, we develop a Hawkes process-based technique to assign relatively fine-grain spatial and temporal risk scores by leveraging high-resolution mobility data based on cell-phone originated location signals. While COVID-19 risk scores also depend on a number of factors specific to an individual, including demography and existing medical conditions, the primary mode of disease transmission is via physical proximity and contact. Therefore, we focus on developing risk scores based on location density and mobility behaviour. We demonstrate the efficacy of the developed risk scores via simulation based on real-world mobility data. Our results show that fine-grain spatiotemporal risk scores based on high-resolution mobility data can provide useful insights and facilitate safe re-opening.","Rambhatla, Sirisha; Zeighami, Sepanta; Shahabi, Kameron; Shahabi, Cyrus; Liu, Yan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07283v1.pdf,470

The views of the following scholars are discussed: Walter Brueggemann, Ying Zhang, John Goldingay and Kathleen Scott Goldingay, N.T. Wright, Philemon M. Chamburuka and Ishanesu S. Gusha, and Peter Lampe. This is followed by the reflections of a biblical scholar and a systematic theologian. From the perspective of a biblical scholar, the following issues are raised: the richness of biblical traditions, the influence of social location on the interpretation of the pandemic in the light of the Bible, the importance of the emphasis on lament, the reluctance to interpret the pandemic as a punishment from God, the importance of the interpreter’s view of God and the emphasis on the way in which the ‘new normal’ should be approached. From the perspective of a systematic theologian the following issues are discussed: The nature of doing theology, the role of the symbol of the Divine, performativity of sense-making, the Trinitarian confession, an emerging new self and the importance of an ethic of responsibility. Contribution: The article is a response to the COVID-19 pandemic and emphasises the critical importance of engaging the Christian scripture. The role accorded to hermeneutics and to an explicit interdisciplinary conversation makes a particular contribution to the emerging crisis discourse. © 2021. The Authors.

499530,CORR Insights®: How Did the Number and Type of Injuries in Patients Presenting to a Regional Level I Trauma Center Change During the Coronavirus-19 Pandemic with a Stay-at-home Order?,2020,"The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) is an ongoing cohort study among older adults in the Netherlands. Respondents are usually interviewed approximately every 3 years. Because of the exceptional situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was decided to add an extra assessment in between, consisting of a postal/digital questionnaire with measures assessing the impact of the COVID-19 situation, as well as a selection of measures from regular LASA measurement cycles covering the physical, social and mental domains. In total, 1128 LASA respondents aged 62-102 years provided data, just after the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. This paper describes the methods and design of the LASA COVID-19 questionnaire, as well as the basic characteristics of the sample, including an overview of impactful situations experienced by older adults during the first months of the pandemic. The data of the questionnaire may be used to study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on multiple domains of functioning in older adults.","Hoogendijk, Emiel O; van der Horst, Marleen H L; Poppelaars, Jan; van Vliet, Majogé; Huisman, Martijn",Aging Clin Exp Res,,470

DESIGN: We performed a laboratory study to assess the ability of 2 commercially available portable GUV devices to inactivate 2 common cold coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on the surface of whole N95 respirators and coupons cut from those respirators. We experimentally contaminated N95 respirators with coronavirus cultures and then assessed viral inactivation after GUV exposure by plaque assay, the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay, and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: We found that GUV could efficiently inactivate coronaviruses on the surface of N95 masks, with an average reduction in viral titers of 5-log for HCoV-229E, 3-log for HCoV-OC43, and 5-log for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the GUV susceptibility of HCoV-229E was similar on coupons and whole N95 respirators. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that diverse human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, are susceptible to GUV inactivation, and 2 scalable portable GUV devices were effective in inactivating coronaviruses on N95 respirators. Thus, GUV treatment with commercially scalable devices may be an effective method to decontaminate PPE, allowing their safe reuse.","Camargo, Carolina; Lupien, Andréanne; McIntosh, Fiona; Menzies, Dick; Behr, Marcel A; Sagan, Selena M",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,470

Despite the presence of respiratory and physical impairments, the patient achieved significant improvements in functional mobility and ADLs. The patient improved her activity tolerance and was discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Rehabilitation management of lung transplant recipients with Covid-19 has not been studied and therefore it is crucial to investigate the effects of early evaluation and treatment of impairments exhibited by these patients, as they will likely require acute and long-term rehabilitation.

MethodsWe enrolled 378 healthcare workers (255 women, 123 men) whose blood samples were collected 91{+/-}15 days after the second of two inoculations of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech) given 3 weeks apart. Medical histories and demographic characteristics were recorded using a structured self-reported questionnaire. The relationships between Ab titres and these factors were analysed. ResultsMedian age (interquartile range [IQR]) of the participants was 44 (32-54) years. Median Ab titre (IQR) against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike antigen was 764 (423-1140) U/mL. Older participants had significantly lower Ab titres; median (IQR) Ab titres were 942 (675-1390) and 1095 (741-1613) U/mL in men and women in their 20s, respectively, but 490 (297-571) and 519 (285-761) U/mL in men and women in their 60s-70s, respectively. In the age-adjusted analysis, the only risk factors for lower Ab titres were male sex and smoking. However, the sex difference may have arisen from the sex difference in smoking rate. Moreover, Ab titres were significantly lower in current smokers than in ex-smokers. ConclusionThe most important factors associated with low Ab titres were age and smoking habit. In particular, current smoking status caused lower Ab titres, and smoking cessation before vaccination may improve the individual efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine.","Nomura, Yushi; Sawahata, Michiru; Nakamura, Yosikazu; Kurihara, Momoko; Koike, Ryousuke; Katsube, Otohiro; Hagiwara, Koichi; Niho, Seiji; Masuda, Norihiro; Tanaka, Takaaki; Sugiyama, Kumiya",,,470

The knowledge on this new disorder is growing fast, but our experience is still limited and when a physician cannot rely on evidence-based medicine, the experience of his peers can support the decision-making and operational process of reopening sleep laboratories. The aim of this paper is to focus on the safety of patients and operators accessing hospitals and the practice of diagnosing and treating sleep-related respiratory disorders. The whole process requires a careful plan, starting with a triage preceding the access to the facility, to minimize the risk of infection. Preparation of the medical record can be performed through standard questionnaires administered over the phone or by e-mail, including an assessment of the COVID-19 risk. The home sleep test should include single-patient sensors or easy-to-sanitize material. The use of nasal cannulas is discouraged in view of the risk of the virus colonizing the internal reading chamber, since no filter has been tested and certified to be used extensively for coronavirus due to its small size. The adaptation to positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment can also be performed mainly using telemedicine procedures. In the adaptation session, the mask should be new or correctly sanitized and the PAP device, without a humidifier, should be protected by an antibacterial/antiviral filter, then sanitized and reassigned after at least 4 days since SARS-CoV-2 was detected on some surfaces up to 72 h after. Identification of pressure should preferably be performed by telemedicine. The patient should be informed of the risk of spreading the disease in the family environment through droplets and how to reduce this risk. The follow-up phase can again be performed mainly by telemedicine both for problem solving and the collection of data. Public access to hospital should be minimized and granted to patients only. Constant monitoring of institutional communications will help in implementing the necessary recommendations.","Insalaco, Giuseppe; Dal Farra, Fabrizio; Braghiroli, Alberto; Salvaggio, Adriana",Respiration,,470

Design: Survey study. Setting: National virtual conference administered by the Orthopaedic Trauma Association. Participants: Attendees of virtual fracture conference. Intervention: Participation at a national virtual fracture conference. Main outcome measure: Surveys of perception of quality and value of virtual conferences relative to in-person conferences. Results: Ninety-six percent of participants rated the virtual fracture conference as similar or improved educational quality relative to conventional in-person fracture conference. Participants also felt they learned as much (35%) or more (57%) at each virtual fracture conference compared to the amount learned in-person. The quality of interpersonal interactions at both the resident-faculty level and faculty-faculty level was also perceived to be overall superior to those at participants' own institutions. Learners felt they were more likely to engage the primary literature as well. Overall, 100% of participants were likely to recommend virtual conference to their colleagues and 100% recommended continuing this conference even after COVID-19 issues resolve. Conclusions: We found that learners find significant educational value in a national virtual fracture conference compared to in-person fracture conferences at their own institution.

Few studies have reported transmission rates to tracheotomy surgeons. We describe our safety practices and the transmission rate to our surgical team after performing tracheotomy on patients with COVID-19 during the peak of the pandemic at a US epicenter. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary academic hospital. METHODS: Tracheotomy procedures for patients with COVID-19 that were performed April 15 to May 28, 2020, were reviewed, with a focus on the surgical providers involved. Methods of provider protection were recorded. Provider health status was the main outcome measure. RESULTS: Thirty-six open tracheotomies were performed, amounting to 65 surgical provider exposures, and 30 (83.3%) procedures were performed at bedside. The mean time to tracheotomy from hospital admission for SARS-CoV-2 symptoms was 31 days, and the mean time to intubation was 24 days. Standard personal protective equipment, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was worn for each case. Powered air-purifying respirators were not used. None of the surgical providers involved in tracheotomy for patients with COVID-19 demonstrated positive antibody seroconversion or developed SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms to date. CONCLUSION: Tracheotomy for patients with COVID-19 can be done with minimal risk to the surgical providers when standard personal protective equipment is used (surgical gown, gloves, eye protection, hair cap, and N95 mask). Whether timing of tracheotomy following onset of symptoms affects the risk of transmission needs further study.","Thal, Arielle G; Schiff, Bradley A; Ahmed, Yasmina; Cao, Angela; Mo, Allen; Mehta, Vikas; Smith, Richard V; Cohen, Hillel W; Ow, Thomas J",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,470

506977,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on characteristics of retinal detachments: the Canadian experience,2020,"Although transgender women of color, specifically Black and Latina experience gender-based violence in a variety of contexts, one of the most consistently reported is from a dating or romantic partner. This qualitative study sought to understand the manifestations and consequences of stigma experienced by transgender women of color in their dating or romantic relationships. Between January and February 2019, we purposively recruited 33 transgender women of color to participate in five focus group discussions and complete a brief survey. We employed both inductive and deductive approaches to coding and thematic analysis. We identified different forms of anti-transgender interpersonal stigma experienced by transgender women of color seeking romantic relationships and by those in romantic relationships. For those dating and seeking relationships, anti-transgender interpersonal stigma took the form of dehumanizing stereotypes and sexual objectification. While these manifestations of anti-transgender interpersonal stigma persisted for some within relationships, concealment behaviors from partners was the predominant type of anti-transgender interpersonal stigma. Each of these forms of anti-transgender interpersonal stigma had significant gender-based violence consequences, specifically encountering physical violence, experiencing psychological trauma, and engaging in survival strategies. In the current climate of COVID-19, which is exacerbating risks of gender-based violence, there is an urgent need to understand and address the nuanced manifestations of stigma in relationships and their consequences on the lives of transgender women of color. Culturally grounded gender-based violence prevention policies and programs with transgender women should address these forms of stigma and build on community strengths. Findings also highlight the importance of future research and gender-based violence prevention programming with cisgender men in/seeking partnerships with transgender women of color.","Gamarel, Kristi E; Jadwin-Cakmak, Laura; King, Wesley M; Lacombe-Duncan, Ashley; Trammell, Racquelle; Reyes, Lilianna A; Burks, Cierra; Rivera, Bré; Arnold, Emily; Harper, Gary W",J Interpers Violence,,470

Several variants of concern have emerged including those in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil. SARS-CoV-2 can cause a dysregulated inflammatory response known as a cytokine storm, which can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, and death. Suppressing these cytokine elevations may be key to improving outcomes. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a simple, non-invasive procedure whereby a blood pressure cuff is inflated and deflated on the upper arm for several cycles. ""RIC in COVID-19"" is a pilot, multi-center, randomized clinical trial, designed to ascertain whether RIC suppresses inflammatory cytokine production. METHODS: A minimum of 55 adult patients with diagnosed COVID-19, but not of critical status, will be enrolled from centers in the United Kingdom, Brazil, and South Africa. RIC will be administered daily for up to 15 days. The primary outcome is the level of inflammatory cytokines that are involved in the cytokine storm that can occur following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The secondary endpoint is the time between admission and until intensive care admission or death. The in vitro cytotoxicity of patient blood will also be assessed using primary human cardiac endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study will provide initial evidence on the ability of RIC to suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines in the setting of COVID-19.

Findings show that scientific globalism occurs differently when comparing COVID-19 publications with non-COVID-19 publications during as well as before the pandemic. Despite the tense geopolitical climate, countries increased their proportion of international collaboration and open-access publications during the pandemic. However, not all countries engaged more globally. Countries that have been more impacted by the crisis and those with relatively lower GDPs tended to participate more in scientific globalism than their counterparts.","Lee, Jenny J; Haupt, John P",High Educ (Dordr),,470

Statins, given their anti-inflammatory properties, may reduce the associated morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to determine the association between statin use prior to hospitalization and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records of patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 infection from March 1, 2020 to April 24, 2020. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to study the association of pre-admission statin use with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of 255 patients, 116 (45.5%) patients were on statins prior to admission and 139 (54.5%) were not. The statin group had a higher proportion of end stage renal disease (ESRD) (13.8% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.001), diabetes mellitus (63.8% vs. 35.2%, p<0.001), hypertension (87.9% vs. 61.1%, p < 0.001) and coronary artery disease (CAD) (33.6% vs. 5%, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, we found a statistically significant decrease in the odds of in-hospital mortality in patients on statins before admission (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03- 0.61, p = 0.008). In the subgroup analysis, statins were associated with a decrease in mortality in those with CAD (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.0003-0.92 p = 0.045) and those without CAD (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.005-0.43, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that statins are associated with reduced in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19, regardless of CAD status. More comprehensive epidemiological and molecular studies are needed to establish the role of statins in COVID-19.","Chacko, Shireen R; DeJoy, Robert; Lo, Kevin Bryan; Albano, Jeri; Peterson, Eric; Bhargav, Ruchika; Gu, Fahad; Salacup, Grace; Pelayo, Jerald; Azmaiparashvili, Zurab; Rangaswami, Janani; Patarroyo-Aponte, Gabriel; Benzaquen, Sadia; Gupta, Ena",Am J Med Sci,,470

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in China occurred during the Spring Festival when a large number of migrants traveled between cities, which greatly increased the infection risk of COVID-19 across the country. Financially supported by the Wuhan government, and based on cellphone signaling data from Unicom (a mobile phone carrier) and Baidu location-based data, this paper analyzed the effects that city dwellers, non-commuters, commuters, and people seeking medical services had on the transmission risk of COVID-19 in the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan. The paper also evaluated the effects of the city lockdown policy on the spread of the pandemic outside and inside Wuhan. The results show that although the daily business activities in the South China Seafood Wholesale Market and nearby commuters’ travel behaviors concentrated in the Hankou area, a certain proportion of these people were distributed in the Wuchang and Hanyang areas. The areas with relatively high infection risks of COVID-19 were scattered across Wuhan during the early outbreak of the pandemic. The lockdown in Wuhan closed the passageways of external transport at the very beginning, largely decreasing migrant population and effectively preventing the spread of the pandemic to the outside. However, the Wuhan lockdown had little effect on preventing the spread of the pandemic within Wuhan at that time. During this period, a large amount of patients who went to hospitals for medical services were exposed to a high risk of cross-infection without precaution awareness. The pandemic kept dispersing in three towns until the improvement of the capacity of medical treatment, the management of closed communities, the national support to Wuhan, and the implementation of a series of emergency responses at the same time. The findings in this paper reveal the spatiotemporal features of the dispersal of infection risk of COVID-19 and the effects of the prevention and control measures during the early days of the pandemic. The findings were adopted by the Wuhan government to make corresponding policies and could also provide supports to the control of the pandemic in the other regions and countries.","Luo, Minghai Qin Sixian Tan Bo Cai Mingming Yue Yufeng Xiong Qiangqiang",ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,,470

METHODS: We used descriptive statistics to compare ED volume and rates of admission for patients presenting to the ED between January and early May of 2018, 2019, and 2020. RESULTS: Immediately after California's ""safer-at-home"" declaration, ED utilization dropped by 11,000 visits (37%) compared to the same nine weeks in prior years. The drop affected patients regardless of acuity, demographics, or diagnosis. Reductions were observed in the number of patients reporting symptoms often associated with COVID-19 and all other complaints. After the declaration, higher acuity, older, male, Black, uninsured or non-Medicaid, publicly insured, accounted for a disproportionate share of utilization. CONCLUSION: We show an abrupt, discontinuous impact of COVID-19 on ED utilization with a slow return as safer-at-home orders have lifted. It is imperative to determine how this reduction will impact patient outcomes, disease control, and the health of the community in the medium and long terms.","Lam, Chun Nok; Axeen, Sarah; Terp, Sophie; Burner, Elizabeth; Dworkis, Daniel A; Arora, Sanjay; Menchine, Michael",West J Emerg Med,,470

Limited data exist on the magnitude and durability of antibodies generated by natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 and whether they can provide long-lasting immunity from reinfection. Vaccination has proven the most effective measure for controlling and preventing pandemics and, thus, development of a vaccine against COVID-19 is a top priority. However, the doses required to induce effective, long-lasting antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 remain undetermined. Here, we present the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates encoding the viral spike (S) gene, generated using plasmid (p)DNA technology, and we demonstrate the eliciting of S-specific antibodies in mice after three and four doses. The magnitude of binding and neutralizing antibody responses with three doses of synthetic, codon-optimized, full-length S (S.opt.FL) vaccine is comparable to that generated after four doses, suggesting that three doses are sufficient to elicit robust immune responses. Conversely, four doses of S1.opt pDNA vaccine, containing the S globular head, are required to elicit high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, the S.opt.FL pDNA vaccine induces the highest serum levels of interferon (IFN)-Î³, a marker for activation of cellular immune responses. Overall, our data show that three doses of S.FL pDNA vaccine elicit potent neutralizing antibody responses, with preclinical data that support the immunogenicity of these COVID-19 vaccine candidates and provide justification for further translational studies.","Almansour, Iman; Macadato, Nabela Calamata; Alshammari, Thamer",,,470

513661,Model-based Evaluation of Continued COVID-19 Risk at Long Term Care Facilities,2021,"ORF7a is an accessory protein common to SARS-CoV1 and the recently discovered SARS-CoV2, which is causing the COVID19 pandemic. The ORF7a protein has a structural homology with ICAM-1 which binds to the T lymphocyte integrin receptor LFA-1. As COVID19 has a strong immune component as part of the disease, we sought to determine whether SARS-CoV2 would have a similar structural interaction with LFA-1. Using molecular docking simulations, we found that SARS-CoV2 ORF7a has the key structural determinants required to bind LFA-1 but also the related leukocyte integrin Mac-1, which is also known to be expressed by macrophages. Our study shows that SARS-CoV2 ORF7a protein has a conserved Ig immunoglobulin-like fold containing an integrin binding site that provides a mechanistic hypothesis for SARS-CoV2's interaction with the human immune system. This suggests that experimental investigation of ORF7a mediated effects on immune cells such as T lymphocytes and macrophages (leukocytes) could help understand the disease further and develop effective treatments.","Nizamudeen, Zubair A; Xu, Emma-Ruoqi; Karthik, Vivin; Halawa, Mohamed; Arkill, Kenton P; Jackson, Andrew; Bates, David O; Elmsley, Jonas",Biosci. rep,,470

514686,Racial Disparities in Potentially Avoidable Hospitalizations During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading all over the world, particularly in developed countries where obesity is also widespread. There is a high frequency of increased BMI in patients admitted to intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 infection with a major severity in patients with an excess of visceral adiposity. Patients at risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory syndrome are characterised by the high prevalence of pre-existing diseases (high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer), most of them typically present in severely obese patients. Indeed, the biological role of adipose tissue in sustaining SARS-CoV-2 infection is not completely elucidated. SUMMARY: The forced isolation due to pandemic containment measures abruptly interrupted the rehabilitation programs to which many patients with severe obesity were enrolled. People affected by obesity, and especially those with severe obesity, should continue clinical rehabilitation programs, taking extra measures to avoid COVID-19 infection and reinforcing the adoption of preventive procedures. In this review, the available data on obesity and COVID-19 are discussed along with evidence-based strategies for maintaining the necessary continuous rehabilitation programs. Key Messages: Greater attention is needed for obese and severely obese patients in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic, which represents a huge challenge for both patients and healthcare professionals. The adoption of new strategies to guarantee adequate and continuous multidisciplinary nutritional rehabilitation programs will be crucial to control the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in high-risk populations as well as the worsening of obesity-linked complications. Health authorities should be urged to equip hospitals with tools for the diffusion of telemedicine to maintain physician-patient communication, which is fundamental in chronic and complicated obese patients.","De Amicis, Ramona; Cancello, Raffaella; Capodaglio, Paolo; Gobbi, Michele; Brunani, Amelia; Gilardini, Luisa; Castenuovo, Gianluca; Molinari, Enrico; Barbieri, Valerio; Mambrini, Sara Paola; Battezzati, Alberto; Bertoli, Simona",Obes Facts,,470

515420,The Epidemiology of Hip and Knee Primary and Revision Arthroplasties during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide and poses a severe health risk. While most patients present mild symptoms, descending pneumonia can lead to severe respiratory insufficiency. Up to 50% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea or nausea, intriguingly associating with prolonged symptoms and increased severity. Thus, models to understand and validate drug efficiency in COVID-19 patients are of urgent need. METHODS: Human intestinal organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSC-HIOs) have led, due to their complexity in mimicking human intestinal architecture, to an unprecedented number of successful disease models including gastrointestinal infections. Here, we employed PSC-HIOs to dissect SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its inhibition by remdesivir, one of the leading drugs investigated for treatment of COVID-19. RESULTS: Immunostaining for viral entry receptor ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein priming protease TMPRSS2 showed broad expression in the gastrointestinal tract with highest levels in the intestine, the latter faithfully recapitulated by PSC-HIOs. Organoids could be readily infected with SARS-CoV-2 followed by viral spread across entire PSC-HIOs, subsequently leading to organoid deterioration. However, SARS-CoV-2 spared goblet cells lacking ACE2 expression. Importantly, we challenged PSC-HIOs for drug testing capacity. Specifically, remdesivir effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection dose-dependently at low micromolar concentration and rescued PSC-HIO morphology. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, PSC-HIOs are a valuable tool to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify and validate drugs especially with potential action in the gut.","Krüger, Jana; Groß, Rüdiger; Conzelmann, Carina; Müller, Janis A; Koepke, Lennart; Sparrer, Konstantin M J; Weil, Tatjana; Schütz, Desirée; Seufferlein, Thomas; Barth, Thomas F E; Stenger, Steffen; Heller, Sandra; Münch, Jan; Kleger, Alexander",Cell Mol.

517805,COVID-19 concerns and worries in patients with mental illness,2020,"From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic we, the nuclear medicine (NM) community, expediently mobilized to enable continuity of essential services to the best of our abilities. For example, we effectuated adapted guidelines for NM standard operating procedures (SOPs) and enacted heightened infection protection measures for staff, patients, and the public, alike. Challenges in radionuclide supply chains were identified and often met. NM procedural volumes declined globally and underwent restoration of varying degrees, contingent upon local contexts. Serial surveys have gauged and chronicled such geographical variance of the impact of COVID-19 on NM service delivery and, though it may be too early to fully understand the long-term consequences of reduced NM services, overall, we can certainly expect that this era adversely affected the management of many patients afflicted with non-communicable diseases. Today we are unquestionably better prepared to face unforeseen outbreaks, but a degree of uncertainty lingers. Which lessons learned will endure in the form of permanent NM pandemic preparedness procedures and protocols? In this spirit, the present manuscript presents a revision of prior recommendations issued mid-pandemic to NM centers, some of which may become mainstays in NM service delivery and implementation. Discussed herein are (1) comparative worldwide survey results of the measurable impact of COVID-19 on the practice of nuclear medicine (2) the definitions of a pandemic and its phases (3) relevant, recently developed or updated guidelines specific to nuclear medicine (4) incidental findings of COVID-19 on hybrid nuclear medicine studies performed primarily for oncologic indications and (5) how pertinent pedagogical methods for medical education, research, and development have been re-invented in a suddenly more virtual world. NM professionals shall indefinitely adopt many of the measures implemented during this pandemic, to enable continuity of essential services while preventing the spread of the virus. Which ones? Practices must remain ready for possible new peaks or variants of the roiling COVID-19 contagion and for the emergence of potential new pathogens that may incite future outbreaks or pandemics. Communications technologies are here to stay and will continue to be used in a broad spectrum of applications, from telemedicine to education, but how best? NM departments must align synergistically with these trends, considering what adaptations to a more virtual professional environment should not only last but be further innovated. The paper aims to provide recent history, analysis, and a springboard for continued constructive dialogue. To best navigate the future, NM must continue to learn from this crisis and must continue to bring new questions, evidence, ideas, and warranted systematic updates to the figurative table.","Paez, Diana; Mikhail-Lette, Miriam; Gnanasegaran, Gopinath; Dondi, Maurizio; Estrada-Lobato, Enrique; Bomanji, Jamshed; Vinjamuri, Sobhan; El-Haj, Noura; Morozova, Olga; Alonso, Omar; Pellet, Olivier; Orellana, Pilar; Navarro, Maria C; Delgado Bolton, Roberto C; Giammarile, Francesco",Semin. nucl. med,,470

METHODS: To this end, a population-based study, in the province of Udine (466,700 inhabitants, with age > 15 years old, Friuli Venezia Giulia region, Italy) was planned. The primary outcome was the prevalence of COVID-19 in the first two months of the outbreak. All the rheumatic patients treated with biologic agents or small molecules in the last 6 months in our province were included (N=1051). RESULTS: From February 29 to April 25, 2020, 4 adult patients (4/1051, i.e. 3.8/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.5-9.7/1000) were registered as swab test positive by PCR for COVID-19. Overall, a total of 47/1051 (4,5%) cases were tested for COVID-19 by PCR in the same period, and 15 of them due to symptoms compatible with COVID-19. In the general population, the prevalence was 937 cases/466700 (2/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.9-2.1/1000, p value=0.33, chi square test), and 20,179/466,700 (4.3%) swab tests for COVID-19 were performed.. CONCLUSION: The risk of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients under biologic agents or small molecules does not appear different from that observed in the general population.

Women retrospectively reported their mental/emotional health before the pandemic, as well as depression, stress, and substance use as a result of the pandemic at both time points. Linear regression measured cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between mental health and substance use.Results: Pre-COVID-19 reports of poorer mental/emotional health (b = 0.46) were significantly (p < .05) associated with number of substances used to cope with the pandemic. Elevated stress (b = 0.35) and depressive symptoms (b = 0.27) and poorer mental/emotional health (b = 0.14) in April were also significantly related to higher numbers of substances used in May (p < .05).Conclusion: Pregnant women's psychological well-being may be a readily measured indicator substance use risk during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

520585,"Lessons learned with remote research among older adults during COVID-19, a qualitative reflection",2021,"The objectives of this study are to examine the factors affecting the intention and actual usage behavior on mHealth adoption, investigate the effect of actual usage behavior of mHealth on mental well-being of the end-users, and investigate the moderating role of self-quarantine on the intention-actual usage of mHealth under the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic situation. The required primary data were gathered from the end-users of mHealth in Bangladesh. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), this study has confirmed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, and facilitating conditions have a positive influence on behavioral intention whereas health consciousness has an impact on both intention and actual usage behavior. mHealth usage behavior has an affirmative and meaningful effect on the mental well-being of the service users. Moreover, self-quarantine has strong influence on actual usage behavior but does not moderate the intention-behavior relationship. In addition, due to the existence of a non-linearity problem in the data set, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach was engaged to sort out relatively significant predictors acquired from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). However, this study contributes to the emergent mHealth literature by revealing how the use of the mHealth services elevates the quality of patients' mental well-being under this pandemic situation.","Alam, Mirza Mohammad Didarul; Alam, Mohammad Zahedul; Rahman, Syed Abidur; Taghizadeh, Seyedeh Khadijeh",J Biomed Inform,,470

Nowadays the patient with co-infection of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 was rarely reported. Here we reported a special case with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, which showed a prolonged viral shedding duration. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was infected with HIV 8 years ago through sexual transmission and had the normal CD4+T cell count. She was found SARS-CoV-2 positive using real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) during the epidemic. Most importantly, the patient had a prolonged viral shedding duration of SARS-CoV-2 about 28 days. CONCLUSION: The viral shedding duration may be prolonged in people living with HIV. The 14 days isolation strategy might not be long enough for them. The isolation or discharge of these patients needs further confirmation for preventing epidemics.","Menghua, Wu; Xin, Zheng; Jianwei, Liu; Yu, Zhang; Qinwei, Yao",AIDS Res Ther,,470
521696,COVID-19 pandemic and the necessity of spiritual care,2020,"Interactions in biology and social systems are not restricted to pairwise but can take arbitrary sizes. Extensive studies have revealed that the arbitrary-sized interactions significantly affect the spreading dynamics on networked systems. Competing spreading dynamics, i.e., several epidemics spread simultaneously and compete with each other, have been widely observed in the real world, yet the way arbitrary-sized interactions affect competing spreading dynamics still lacks systematic study. This study presents a model of two competing simplicial susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemics on a higher-order system represented by simplicial complex and analyzes the model's critical phenomena. In the proposed model, a susceptible node can only be infected by one of the two epidemics, and the transmission of infection to neighbors can occur through pairwise (i.e., an edge) and high-order (e.g., 2-simplex) interactions simultaneously. Through a mean-field (MF) theory analysis and numerical simulations, we show that the model displays rich dynamical behavior depending on the 2-simplex infection strength. When the 2-simplex infection strength is weak, the model's phase diagram is consistent with the simple graph, consisting of three regions: the absolute dominant regions for each epidemic and the epidemic-free region. With the increase of the 2-simplex infection strength, a new phase region called the alternative dominant region emerges. In this region, the survival of one epidemic depends on the initial conditions. Our theoretical analysis can reasonably predict the time evolution and steady-state outbreak size in each region. In addition, we further explore the model's phase diagram both when the 2-simplex infection strength is symmetrical and asymmetrical. The results show that the 2-simplex infection strength has a significant impact on the system phase diagram.","Li, Wenyao; Xue, Xiaoyu; Pan, Liming; Lin, Tao; Wang, Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08234v1.pdf,470
521829,COVID-19-Related Fear and Health-Related Safety Behavior in Oncological Patients,2020,"This is a short review of the basic molecular mechanisms of ovarian aging, written with a particular focus on the use of this data to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic protocols both for women affected by physiological (age-related) ovarian decay and for those suffering premature ovarian insufficiency. Ovarian aging has a genetic basis that conditions the ovarian activity via a plethora of cell-signaling pathways that control the functions of different types of cells in the ovary. There are various factors that can influence these pathways so as to reduce their efficiency. Oxidative stress, often related to mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to the apoptosis of ovarian cells, can be at the origin of vicious circles in which the primary cause feeds back other abnormalities, resulting in an overall decline in the ovarian activity and in the quantity and quality of oocytes. The correct diagnosis of the molecular mechanisms involved in ovarian aging can serve to design treatment strategies that can slow down ovarian decay and increase the quantity and quality of oocytes that can be obtained for an in vitro fertilization attempt. The available treatment options include the use of antioxidants, melatonin, growth hormones, and mitochondrial therapies. All of these treatments have to be considered in the context of each couple's history and current clinical condition, and a customized (patient-tailored) treatment protocol is to be elaborated.","Tesarik, Jan; Galán-Lázaro, Maribel; Mendoza-Tesarik, Raquel",Int. j. mol. sci.

Molecular understanding of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) would greatly help advance the development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy, as well as the design of next generation recombinant vaccines. Here, we applied H2L2 transgenic mice encoding the human immunoglobulin variable regions, together with a state-of-the-art antibody discovery platform to immunize and isolate NAbs. From a large panel of isolated antibodies, 25 antibodies showed potent neutralizing activities at sub-nanomolar levels by engaging the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). Importantly, one human NAb, termed PR1077, from the H2L2 platform and 2 humanized NAb, including PR953 and PR961, were further characterized and subjected for subsequent structural analysis. High-resolution X-ray crystallography structures unveiled novel epitopes on the receptor-binding motif (RBM) for PR1077 and PR953, which directly compete with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for binding, and a novel non-blocking epitope on the neighboring site near RBM for PR961. Moreover, we further tested the antiviral efficiency of PR1077 in the Ad5-hACE2 transduction mouse model of COVID-19. A single injection provided potent protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in either prophylactic or treatment groups. Taken together, these results shed light on the development of mAb-related therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.","Fu, Dan; Zhang, Guangshun; Wang, Yuhui; Zhang, Zheng; Hu, Hengrui; Shen, Shu; Wu, Jun; Li, Bo; Li, Xin; Fang, Yaohui; Liu, Jia; Wang, Qiao; Zhou, Yunjiao; Wang, Wei; Li, Yufeng; Lu, Zhonghua; Wang, Xiaoxiao; Nie, Cui; Tian, Yujie; Chen, Da; Wang, Yuan; Zhou, Xingdong; Wang, Qisheng; Yu, Feng; Zhang, Chen; Deng, Changjing; Zhou, Liang; Guan, Guangkuo; Shao, Na; Lou, Zhiyong; Deng, Fei; Zhang, Hongkai; Chen, Xinwen; Wang, Manli; Liu, Louis; Rao, Zihe; Guo, Yu",PLoS Biol,,470

COVID-19 has caused significant loss of life and disrupted global society at a level never before encountered. While the disease was predominantly characterized by respiratory symptoms initially, it became clear that other systems including the cardiovascular and neurological systems were also involved. Several thrombotic complications were reported including venous thrombosis, vasculitis, cardiomyopathy, and stroke. Thrombosis and inflammation are implicated in various non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This is of significant concern as people with pre-existing conditions such as cardiovascular disorders, renal disorders, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes are at greater risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Consequently, the research surrounding the use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet, and antithrombotic strategies for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 is of critical importance. The adoption of a healthy diet, physical exercise, and lifestyle choices can reduce the risk factors associated with NCDs and the thrombo-inflammatory complications. In this review, these thrombotic complications and potential foods, nutraceuticals, and the antithrombotic constituents within that may prevent the onset of severe thrombotic complications as a result of infection are discussed. While nutrition is not a panacea to tackle COVID-19, it is apparent that a patient's nutritional status may affect patient outcomes.

As a matter of fact, clear evidence of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via respiratory aerosol would be of primary importance; at the same time, checking the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can be extremely useful to control the diffusion of the disease. Up to now, many studies report SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in indoor/outdoor air samples or water/wastewater samples that can differ by order of magnitude. Unfortunately, complete information about the scientific approach of many studies is still missing, relating to: samplers and sampling materials performances, recovery tests, measurement uncertainty, robustness, detection and quantification limits, infectivity of captured virus, virus degradation during sampling, influence of sample pre-treatments (included freezing) on results, effects of inhibitors, sample alterations due to manipulation, validation of methods and processes, quality assurance according to ISO/IEC 17025 requirements. Based on the first experiences focused on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples such as air quality filters or impingers collection solutions, the present study describes a coherent preliminary approach to SARS-CoV-2 indoor and outdoor air sampling in order to overcome the evident lack of standardization. Three aspects are highlighted here: the first solution to assure quality and consistency to air sampling relies on the development of recovery tests using standard materials and investigating sampling materials, sampling techniques, sampling durations, sample conservation and pre-treatments; secondly, in order to overcome the shortcomings of every single sampling technique, coupling different samplers in parallel sampling could be an efficient strategy to collect more information and make data more reliable; finally, with regards to airborne virus sampling, the results could be confirmed by simplified emission and dilution models.","Robotto, Angelo; Quaglino, Paola; Lembo, David; Morello, Marcello; Brizio, Enrico; Bardi, Luisella; Civra, Andrea",Environ Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121001419; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121001419?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.110847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33556355/,470

Therefore, several prevention and mitigation measures have been imposed to control the spread of the virus worldwide. The aim of the current study is to identify the commitment level to social distancing and its relationship to psychological stress among members of Saudi society during COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The descriptive correlational design was employed in the current study, and the sample of the study consisted of 536 Saudis selected using convenient sampling method. The study was conducted in four cities in Saudi Arabia (Altayef, Mecca, and Najran, in 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic using quantitative survey method. Several analysis methods using SPSS software were used to analyze the data such as mean and standard deviation, three-way ANOVA, Scheffe's test, and Pearson correlation. RESULTS: The study revealed that the psychological stress and commitment level to social distancing by the study sample during COVID-19 pandemic was moderate, and differences were observed among the study variables. Furthermore, the study revealed a statistically significant negative correlation between the commitment level to social distancing and the exposure to psychological pressures. CONCLUSION: The study contributed to literature by developing a model to enhance the importance of social distancing of people during COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: This cross-sectional, observational study was performed between July 16, 2020 and August 31, 2020, in the retina clinic of a tertiary care eye hospital in south India. All patients undergoing elective retinal surgical procedures underwent RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 before being posted for surgery and after obtaining informed consent. Patients planned for surgery under general anesthesia underwent additional computed tomography of the chest. Testing strategies and outcomes were documented. RESULTS: Out of a total of 413 patients who were given appointments for surgery during this period, nine patients (2.2%) were found to have positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and their surgeries were postponed. The test positivity (prevalence) rate of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection among all elective vitreoretinal surgical patients in our hospital was 2.2%. None of the patients were symptomatic for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that among patients visiting high volume ophthalmic centers in the near future, approximately 1 in 45 patients may be asymptomatic, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. Asymptomatic COVID-19 patients may lead to chances of transmission of the virus inside healthcare facilities among other visiting patients and healthcare workers.","Kannan, Naresh Babu; Sen, Sagnik; Reddy, Harshavardhan; Kumar, Karthik; Rajan, Renu P; Ramasamy, Kim",Indian J Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33120621/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_2870_20,470
592086,Systematic Delineation of Media Polarity on COVID-19 Vaccines in Africa: Computational Linguistic Modeling Study,2021-03-16,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals faced psychological stress caused by fear and anxiety due to the high transmission and mortality rate of the disease, the social isolation, economic problems, and difficulties in reaching health services. Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic centralized pain sensitivity disorder. Psychological, physical and/or autoimmune stressors were found to increase FM symptoms. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the COVID-19 fear and anxiety level, and to examine their effect on disease severity, sleep quality, and mood in FM patients compared to control group. METHODS: This pilot study conducted as a cross-sectional study, and included 62 participants. Participants were divided into two groups: FM patient group (n = 31) and control group (n = 31). Symptom severity, sleep quality, and mood were determined using the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR), Pitsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. In order to evaluate the level of COVID-19 fear and anxiety, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) were used compared to control group. RESULTS: FIQR, PSQI, HAD-A, HAD-D, FCV-19S and CAS scores were significantly higher in the FM group (p = 0.01). A positive significant correlation was found between FCV-19S and CAS results and FIQR, PSQI, and HAD-anx results in FM patients (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This pilot study showed that, the individuals with FM can be more affected by psychological stress, and this situation negatively affects the symptom severity, sleep quality, and mood in FM patients, so these patients should be closely monitored in terms of psychological stressors and their effects during pandemics. More studies with more participants are necessary to describe the challenges lived by fibromyalgia population.","Cankurtaran, Damla; Tezel, Nihal; Ercan, Buse; Yildiz, Sadik Yigit; Akyuz, Ece Unlu",Adv Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34193303/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s42358-021-00200-9,470

PATIENT Few days after the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, a 21-year-old woman experienced massive thrombosis in the deep and superficial cerebral veins together with seizures, neurologic focal deficit, and thrombocytopenia. In the neurointensive care unit, her condition worsened despite early decompressive craniectomy. She developed bilateral segmental pulmonary embolism, left hepatic, and left external iliac venous thrombosis. INTERVENTION Argatroban (0.5-2.2 µg/kg/min) and high-dose IV immunoglobulin (1 g/kg/d for 2 consecutive days) were initiated on day 6 after admission. With these therapies, there was a gradual resolution of multiple sites of venous thrombosis, and platelet count returned to normal. The patient left the ICU with full consciousness, expressive aphasia, and right hemiparesis. CONCLUSIONS This case of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia shows that a good outcome can be obtained even with multiple and life-threatening venous thrombotic lesions.

592244,Gastrointestinal manifestations and nutritional therapy during COVID-19 pandemic: a practical guide for pediatricians,2020-07-07,"Given considerable variation in diagnostic and therapeutic practice, there is a need for national guidance on the use of neuroimaging, fluid biomarkers, cognitive testing, follow-up and diagnostic terminology in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI is a heterogenous clinical syndrome reflecting a change in cognitive function and deficits on neuropsychological testing but relatively intact activities of daily living. MCI is a risk state for further cognitive and functional decline with 5–15% of people developing dementia per year. However, ~50% remain stable at 5 years and in a minority, symptoms resolve over time. There is considerable debate about whether MCI is a useful clinical diagnosis, or whether the use of the term prevents proper inquiry (by history, examination and investigations) into underlying causes of cognitive symptoms, which can include prodromal neurodegenerative disease, other physical or psychiatric illness, or combinations thereof. Cognitive testing, neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers can improve the sensitivity and specificity of aetiological diagnosis, with growing evidence that these may also help guide prognosis. Diagnostic criteria allow for a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease to be made where MCI is accompanied by appropriate biomarker changes, but in practice, such biomarkers are not available in routine clinical practice in the UK. This would change if disease-modifying therapies became available and required a definitive diagnosis but would present major challenges to the National Health Service and similar health systems. Significantly increased investment would be required in training, infrastructure and provision of fluid biomarkers and neuroimaging. Statistical techniques combining markers may provide greater sensitivity and specificity than any single disease marker but their practical usefulness will depend on large-scale studies to ensure ecological validity and that multiple measures, e.g. both cognitive tests and biomarkers, are widely available for clinical use. To perform such large studies, we must increase research participation amongst those with MCI.","Dunne, Ross A; Aarsland, Dag; O’Brien, John T; Ballard, Clive; Banerjee, Sube; Fox, Nick C; Isaacs, Jeremy D; Underwood, Benjamin R; Perry, Richard J; Chan, Dennis; Dening, Tom; Thomas, Alan J; Schryer, Jeffrey; Jones, Anne-Marie; Evans, Alison R; Alessi, Charles; Coulthard, Elizabeth J; Pickett, James; Elton, Peter; Jones, Roy W; Mitchell, Susan; Hooper, Nigel; Kalafatis, Chris; Rasmussen, Jill G C; Martin, Helen; Schott, Jonathan M; Burns, Alistair",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197937/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afaa228,470

This tool can contribute to public health surveillance at both community (wastewater treatment system) and institutional (e.g., colleges, prisons, nursing homes) scales. OBJECTIVES: This research aims to understand the successes, challenges, and lessons learned from initial wastewater surveillance efforts at colleges and university systems to inform future research, development and implementation. METHODS: This paper presents the experiences of 25 college and university systems in the United States that monitored campus wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 during the fall 2020 academic period. We describe the broad range of approaches, findings, resource needs, and lessons learned from these initial efforts. These institutions range in size, social and political geographies, and include both public and private institutions. DISCUSSION: Our analysis suggests that wastewater monitoring at colleges requires consideration of information needs, local sewage infrastructure, resources for sampling and analysis, college and community dynamics, approaches to interpretation and communication of results, and follow-up actions. Most colleges reported that a learning process of experimentation, evaluation, and adaptation was key to progress. This process requires ongoing collaboration among diverse stakeholders including decision-makers, researchers, faculty, facilities staff, students, and community members.","Harris-Lovett, Sasha; Nelson, Kara; Beamer, Paloma; Bischel, Heather N.; Bivins, Aaron; Bruder, Andrea; Butler, Caitlyn; Camenisch, Todd D.; De Long, Susan K.; Karthikeyan, Smruthi; Larsen, David A.; Meierdiercks, Katherine; Mouser, Paula; Pagsuyoin, Sheree; Prasek, Sarah; Radniecki, Tyler S.; Ram, Jeffrey L.; Roper, D.

The admirable impact that this political agenda has garnered across the globe pushes us to ponder what China would offer as it aspires for a more prominent position on the international stage. Particularly, how would China foster its image in Asia and, as a result, earn a favorable voice and even all-out support from Asian countries, countries economically underdeveloped and politically volatile? This paper sets out to answer this question by critiquing whether or not popular perceptions of China’s political system impact how Asians perceive China’s influence in general. Conducting statistical analysis using the fourth wave of Asian Barometer Survey (2016) to assess the above argument, we find that Asians who lend their support for China are more keen to the economic opportunities that China’s growing economy offers their country than they are of China’s political system. In short, China’s authoritarian regime type does not factor into Asians’ perception of China, except when individuals are highly educated with and committed to democratic principles.","Xi, Jinrui; Primiano, Christopher",East Asia (Piscataway),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837181/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12140-020-09334-x,470

U-Report is a mobile empowerment platform that connects young people all over the world to information that will change their lives and influence decisions. Previous studies of U-Report’s effectiveness highlight strengths in the timeliness, low cost and high credibility for collecting and sending information, however they also highlight areas to improve on concerning data representation. EquityTool has developed a simpler approach to assess the wealth quintiles of respondents based on fewer questions derived from large household surveys such as Multiple Indicators Cluster Surveys (MICS) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). METHODS: The methodology of Equity Tool was adopted to assess the socio-economic profile of U-Reporters (ie, enrolled participants of U-Report) in Bangladesh. The RapidPro flow collected the survey responses and scored them against the DHS national wealth index using the EquityTool methodology. This helped placing each U-Reporter who completed all questions into the appropriate wealth quintile. RESULTS: With 19% of the respondents completing all questions, the respondents fell into all 5 wealth quintiles, with 79% in the top-two quintiles and only 21% in the lower-three resulting in an Equity Index of 53/100 where 100 is completely in line with Bangladesh equity distribution and 1 is the least in line. An equitable random sample of 1828 U-Reporters from among the regular and frequent respondents was subsequently created for future surveys and the sample has an Equity Index of 98/100. CONCLUSIONS: U-Report in Bangladesh does reach the poorest quintiles while the initial recruitment skews to respondents towards better off families. It is possible to create an equitable random sub-sample of respondents from all five wealth quintiles and thus process information and data for future surveys. Moving forward, U-Reporters from the poorly represented quintiles may be incentivized to recruit peers to increase equity and representation. In times of COVID-19, U-Report in combination with the EquityTool has the potential to enhance the quality of crowdsourced data for statistical analysis.","Powell, James; Brooks, Christopher; Watanabe, Miku; Balaji, Lakshmi N",Journal of global health,https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.11.09001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791099/,470
595185,Puppy love in the time of Corona: Dog ownership protects against loneliness for those living alone during the COVID-19 lockdown,2020-07-23,"Natural ventilation is an effective strategy to control thermal comfort in buildings, and can be enhanced depending on the window style. The combination of natural ventilation and window can also facilitate the removal or dilution of gaseous pollutants from indoor sources in newly decorated buildings. However, the windows on the same facade may cause gaseous pollutant cross-transmission during single-sided natural ventilation between households on different floors close to the source. Although some research has focused on the pollutant cross-transmission in buildings, the simplification of windows into rectangular openings often affects accurate knowledge of pollutant transmission characteristics. Therefore, this investigation explored gaseous pollutant cross-transmission through real windows during single-sided, buoyancy-driven ventilation in a multistory building. Six types of windows were modeled for the indoor pollutant of gaseous formaldehyde (HCHO). Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was utilized to solve characteristics of pollutant transmission inside and outside the multistory building. The results indicated that the ventilation rates, thermal profiles and pollutant transmission inside and outside the building varied for each window type, although the open window areas were identical. The re-entry ratio of exhausted air entering upper floors and the infection risk of epidemic viruses caused by airborne cross-transmission was sensitive to ventilation rates and window configurations, while the sensitivities for window configurations varied case by case. The comparisons also revealed that the specification of ambient temperature and pollutant release rate ultimately did not affect the evaluation of pollutant cross-transmission using CFD.","Wang, Jihong; Zhang, Tengfei; Wang, Shugang; Battaglia, Francine",Energy Build,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378778817318303; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.08.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288118/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778817318303,470
595210,From predictions to prescriptions: A data-driven response to COVID-19,2021-02-15,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in an enormous dislocation of society especially in South Africa. The South African government has imposed a number of measures aimed at controlling the pandemic, chief being a nationwide lockdown. This has resulted in income loss for individuals and firms, with vulnerable populations (low earners, those in informal and precarious employment, etc.) more likely to be adversely affected through job losses and the resulting income loss. Income loss will likely result in reduced ability to access healthcare and a nutritious diet, thus adversely affecting health outcomes. Given the foregoing, we hypothesize that the economic dislocation caused by the coronavirus will disproportionately affect the health of the poor. METHODS: Using the fifth wave of the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) dataset conducted in 2017 and the first wave of the NIDS-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM) dataset conducted in May/June 2020, this paper estimated income-related health inequalities in South Africa before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health was a dichotomized self-assessed health measure, with fair and poor health categorized as “poor” health, while excellent, very good and good health were categorized as “better” health. Household per capita income was used as the ranking variable. Concentration curves and indices were used to depict the income-related health inequalities. Furthermore, we decomposed the COVID-19 era income-related health inequality in order to ascertain the significant predictors of such inequality. RESULTS: The results indicate that poor health was pro-poor in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, with the latter six times the value of the former. Being African (relative to white), per capita household income and household experience of hunger significantly predicted income-related health inequalities in the COVID-19 era (contributing 130%, 46% and 9% respectively to the inequalities), while being in paid employment had a nontrivial but statistically insignificant contribution (13%) to health inequality. CONCLUSIONS: Given the significance and magnitude of race, hunger, income and employment in determining socioeconomic inequalities in poor health, addressing racial disparities and hunger, income inequality and unemployment will likely mitigate income-related health inequalities in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nwosu, Chijioke O.; Oyenubi, Adeola",Int J Equity Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33413442/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-020-01361-7,470

Several guidelines on tracheostomy procedures and care of tracheostomized patients have been introduced. In addition to these guidelines, further details of the procedure and perioperative care would be helpful. The purpose of this study is to describe our experience and tracheostomy protocol for patients with MERS or COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with MERS were admitted to the ICU, 9 (69.2%) of whom underwent surgical tracheostomy. During the COVID-19 outbreak, surgical tracheostomy was performed in one of seven patients with COVID-19. We reviewed related documents and collected information through interviews with healthcare workers who had participated in designing a tracheostomy protocol. RESULTS: Compared with previous guidelines, our protocol consisted of enhanced PPE, simplified procedures (no limitation in the use of electrocautery and wound suction, no stay suture, and delayed cannula change) and a validated screening strategy for healthcare workers. Our protocol allowed for all associated healthcare workers to continue their routine clinical work and daily life. It guaranteed safe return to general patient care without any related complications or nosocomial transmission during the MERS and COVID-19 outbreaks. CONCLUSION: Our protocol and experience with tracheostomies for MERS and COVID-19 may be helpful to other healthcare workers in building an institutional protocol optimized for their own COVID-19 situation.","Yong Choi, Sung; Shin, Joongbo; Park, Woori; Choi, Nayeon; Sei Kim, Jong; i Choi, Chan; Ko, Jae-Hoon; Ryang Chung, Chi; Son, Young-Ik; Jeong, Han-Sin",Oral Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32590297/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1368837520302979; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1368837520302979?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2020.104861,470

While normal aging produces trends of decreasing white matter (WM) integrity, research on cognitive brain reserve suggests that complex sensory–motor activities across the life span may slow down or reverse these trends. Previous research has focused on structural and functional changes to the human brain caused by training and experience in both linguistic (especially bilingualism) and musical domains. The current research uses diffusion tensor imaging to examine the integrity of subcortical white matter fiber tracts in lifelong musicians. Our analysis, using Tortoise and ICBM-81, reveals higher fractional anisotropy, an indicator of greater WM integrity, in aging musicians in bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi and bilateral uncinate fasciculi. Statistical methods used include Fisher’s method and linear regression analysis. Another unique aspect of this study is the accompanying behavioral performance data for each participant. This is one of the first studies to look specifically at musicianship across the life span and its impact on bilateral WM integrity in aging.","Andrews, Edna; Eierud, Cyrus; Banks, David; Harshbarger, Todd; Michael, Andrew; Rammell, Charlotte",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33419228/; https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11010067,470

METHODS: A survey study was held among members of the Indonesian Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons during week 5 after the first report of COVID-19. A 10 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and 1 essay covered key questions on the area of surgery and operating room, clinics, internal meeting, and consultation. The only open-ended question relates to the last MCQ addresses a future “flipped” medical practice. RESULTS: Response rate was 45.6% among 228 members, with 89.4% did no practice or limited their service to emergency and urgent cases only. Only 1.9% kept their official meeting as usual, while the majority modified it. The practice in the operating theatre and clinic were also altered to comply with the measures; with 21.2% from the total respondents only allowed patients with exposure to come for visit after taking 14 days of self-quarantine. Teleconsultation was practiced by 50% of the respondents, while 41.3% agreed and 10.6% disagreed upon the future “flipped” medical practice. CONCLUSION: In general plastic surgeons have made supportive actions during the pandemic. Surgery was performed with all precautions at the utmost as a reflection of high alert of viral infection.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to quantify the impact of the presence of emergent patients and other related factors on the delay in service for non-emergent patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in patients who visited the ED of a large hospital in Hong Kong from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010. We estimated waiting and length of stay (LOS) for individual non-emergent patients registered during day and evening shifts. Using multiple linear regression, we estimated waiting time and LOS as a function of the presence of emergent patients and other related factors such as patient demographics and clinical factors. In particular, we evaluated the influence of the arrival or presence of emergent patients on the odds of violating the 120-min waiting time target for semi-urgent patients. RESULTS: The arrival of a new emergent patient prolonged the waiting time and LOS of a non-emergent patient by 14.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.2–15.5) and 10.8% (95% CI 10.6–11.0), respectively. An additional patient-hour needed for an emergent patient increased the probability of violating the waiting time target for non-emergent patients (odds ratio 2.3, 95% CI 2.2–2.4). CONCLUSIONS: The arrival of an emergent patient significantly prolonged the waiting time and LOS for non-emergent patients. Discouraging non-urgent ED utilization and building a real-time decision-support system are critical methods needed to relieve staff pressure and guide contingent resource reallocation when emergent patients arrive.","Xu, Mai; Wong, Tse Chiu; Wong, Shui Yee; Chin, Kwai Sang; Tsui, Kwok Leung; Hsia, Renee Y.",J Emerg Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736467913001303; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2012.11.102; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0736467913001303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23759699/,470

Healthy broilers are resistant to inhaled E. coli, but previous infection with vaccine or virulent strains of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) predisposes birds for severe colibacillosis. We investigated whether IBV affects recruitment and function of phagocytic cells and examined NO production, phagocytic and bactericidal activity, and kinetics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and splenocytes. Moreover, we measured cytokine mRNA expression in lung and spleen samples. Broilers were inoculated with IBV H120 vaccine or virulent M41 and challenged 5 days later with E. coli 506. A PBS control and E. coli group without previous virus inoculation were also included. Birds were sacrificed at various time points after inoculation (h/dpi). Inoculation with IBV induced extended and more severe colibacillosis than with E. coli alone. At 4 dpi, the number of KUL-01(+) PBMC in all E. coli-inoculated groups was significantly higher than in PBS-inoculated birds, which correlated with lesion scores. From 1 to 4 dpi, NO production by PBMC from all E. coli-inoculated animals was elevated compared to PBS birds. Bactericidal activity of PBMC in IBV-inoculated animals at 7 dpi was lower than in PBS- and E. coli-inoculated birds, but phagocytic capacity and recruitment were not severely impaired. In spleen samples of IBV-infected animals reduced expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18 and IFN-γ mRNA was found 1 dpi. Our results suggest that enhanced colibacillosis after IBV infection or vaccination is caused at least by altered innate immunity and less by impairment of phagocytic cell function.","Ariaans, Mark P.; Matthijs, Mieke G.R.; van Haarlem, Daphne; van de Haar, Peter; van Eck, Jo H.H.; Hensen, Evert J.; Vervelde, Lonneke",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242708000640; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.02.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18359518/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242708000640,470

598231,Life With Corona: Increased Gender Differences in Aggression and Depression Symptoms Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic Burden in Germany,2021-07-27,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 lockdown, the advent of working from home, and other unprecedent events have resulted in multilayer and multidimensional impacts on our personal, social, and occupational lives. Mental health conditions are deteriorating, financial crises are increasing in prevalence, and the need to stay at home has resulted in the increased prevalence of domestic violence. In Bangladesh, where domestic violence is already prevalent, the lockdown period and stay-at-home orders could result in more opportunities and increased scope for perpetrators of domestic violence. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence and pattern of domestic violence during the initial COVID-19 lockdown period in Bangladesh and the perceptions of domestic violence survivors with regard to mental health care. METHODS: We conducted this cross-sectional web-based study among the Bangladeshi population and used a semistructured self-reported questionnaire to understand the patterns of domestic violence and perceptions on mental health care from August to September 2020. The questionnaire was disseminated on different organizational websites and social media pages (ie, those of organizations that provide mental health and domestic violence services). Data were analyzed by using IBM SPSS (version 22.0; IBM Corporation). RESULTS: We found that 36.8% (50/136) of respondents had faced domestic violence at some point in their lives; psychological abuse was the most common type of violence. However, the prevalence of the economical abuse domestic violence type increased after the COVID-19 lockdown was enforced. Although 96.3% (102/136) of the participants believed that domestic violence survivors need mental health support, only 25% (34/136) of the respondents had an idea about the mental health services that are available for domestic violence survivors in Bangladesh and how and where they could avail mental health services. CONCLUSIONS: Domestic violence is one of the most well-known stressors that have direct impacts on physical and mental health. However, the burden of domestic violence is often underreported, and its impact on mental health is neglected in Bangladesh. The burden of this problem has increased during the COVID-19 crisis, and the cry for mental health support is obvious in the country. However, it is necessary to provide information about available support services; telepsychiatry can be good option for providing immediate mental health support in a convenient and cost-effective manner.","Rashid Soron, Tanjir; Ashiq, Md Ashiqur Rahman; Al-Hakeem, Marzia; Chowdhury, Zaid Farzan; Uddin Ahmed, Helal; Afrooz Chowdhury, Chaman",JMIR Form Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34346893/; https://doi.org/10.2196/24624,470
598558,Sex-tailored pharmacology and COVID-19: next steps towards appropriateness and health equity(),2021-08-26,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative motor disorder characterized by selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of the midbrain, depletion of dopamine (DA), and impaired nigrostriatal pathway. The pathological hallmark of PD includes the aggregation and accumulation α-synuclein (α-SYN). Although the precise mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of PD are still unknown, the activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs), mainly TLR4 and subsequent neuroinflammatory immune response, seem to play a significant role. Mounting evidence suggests that viral infection can concur with the precipitation of PD or parkinsonism. The recently identified coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), responsible for 160 million cases that led to the death of more than three million individuals worldwide. Studies have reported that many patients with COVID-19 display several neurological manifestations, including acute cerebrovascular diseases, conscious disturbance, and typical motor and non-motor symptoms accompanying PD. In this review, the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 and its possible involvement in the pathogenesis of PD are discussed. Specifically, the involvement of the TLR4 signaling pathway in mediating the virus entry, as well as the massive immune and inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients is explored. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to TLR4 and the possible interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and α-SYN as contributing factors to neuronal death are also considered.","Conte, Carmela",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22137135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34281186/,470
598903,Pediatric Ophthalmology Provider and Staff Attitudes and Patient Satisfaction in Telehealth Implementation During COVID-19,2021,"ABSTRACT: The Na,K-ATPase establishes the electrochemical gradient of cells by driving an active exchange of Na(+) and K(+) ions while consuming ATP. The minimal functional transporter consists of a catalytic α-subunit and a β-subunit with chaperon activity. The Na,K-ATPase also functions as a cell adhesion molecule and participates in various intracellular signaling pathways. The maturation and trafficking of the Na,K-ATPase include co- and post-translational processing of the enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus and subsequent delivery to the plasma membrane (PM). The ER folding of the enzyme is considered as the rate-limiting step in the membrane delivery of the protein. It has been demonstrated that only assembled Na,K-ATPase α:β-complexes may exit the organelle, whereas unassembled, misfolded or unfolded subunits are retained in the ER and are subsequently degraded. Loss of function of the Na,K-ATPase has been associated with lung, heart, kidney and neurological disorders. Recently, it has been shown that ER dysfunction, in particular, alterations in the homeostasis of the organelle, as well as impaired ER-resident chaperone activity may impede folding of Na,K-ATPase subunits, thus decreasing the abundance and function of the enzyme at the PM. Here, we summarize our current understanding on maturation and subsequent processing of the Na,K-ATPase in the ER under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

The possibility that IBD is an infection has been debated since the first description of Crohn’s disease. Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis was the first organism to be suggested as an IBD pathogen, and it has been argued that it fulfils Koch’s postulates and could be designated the cause of Crohn’s disease. Other organisms have been postulated as possible IBD pathogens, including various Helicobacter species, one of which has been identified in primate colitis; others are widely used in animal models of IBD. Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli appear specific to ileal Crohn’s disease and have been shown to induce the release of TNF-α, a key cytokine in IBD inflammation. The aim of this article is to give a concise overview of the infections postulated as being relevant to the onset of IBD. We will also briefly cover the immunology underpinning IBD, in addition to reviewing current knowledge regarding other microorganisms that are associated with modifying the risk of developing IBD. It may be that infectious organisms have an orchestrator role in the development of dysbiosis and subsequently IBD.","Hansen, Richard; Thomson, John M.; El-Omar, Emad M.; Hold, Georgina L.",J Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20076977/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00535-009-0191-y,470

Cancer patients seem to exhibit exacerbated conditions and higher mortality rates. Vaccines are a promising solution to minimize the problem amongst cancer patients but there are limitations to be considered. Case summary: Herein, we present two cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cases which were in long-term remission and experienced a flare after immunization with a viral vector COVID-19 vaccine (Vaxzevria, Oxford/AstraZeneca). The first case was a 60-year-old male with early-stage (T1a) folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (MF) clinically presented as alopecia areata-like lesions. The patient was in clinical remission during the last two years, maintaining a T1aN0M0 stage with only a single, stable alopecic patch on the scalp. Four weeks after the first COVID-19 vaccine dose, a minor lichenoid induration was observed in the periphery of the lesion, while a week after the second dose, small nodules surrounding the lesion were also noted. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of CD30+ Large cell transformation (LCT) of tumor-stage MF. The second case was a 73-year-old female with early-stage MF (T1a/IA) and Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP). Clinically, she presented with pruritic erythematous patches and nodules on the trunk and upper legs. The patient was successfully treated with psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) phototherapy remaining in clinical remission for six years. After vaccination, she developed multiple erythematous papules and nodules on the trunk and limbs. A flare of LyP was confirmed from the pathology, which correlated to her clinical picture. Discussion: These cases raise the question of whether and via which pathways the vaccine might induce disease exacerbation of both MF and LyP. According to the literature, the education of T (CD4+ and CD8+) and B cells against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein appears to be the main strategy for COVID-19 vaccine production. Both cancers and viral infections can provide a chronic and persistent antigenic load, leading to up-regulated programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) expression and ultimately T cell exhaustion. CD30 is known to be expressed in a small subset of activated T and B cells, as well as a variety of lymphoid neoplasms. Initial studies showed that CD30 expression on lymphocytes could be induced via in vitro antigenic stimulation by mitogens or viruses. CD30 expression also appears to be higher on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing a Th2-type cytokine profile. In our cases, the viral vector-based vaccines used do not contain a live virus but specific parts of the coronavirus attached to adenovirus, which can also stimulate an anti-viral immune response. Conclusion: The reported cases suggest that disease flare-ups may be associated with overproduction and exhaustion of CD4+/CD8+ T cells expressing CD30 after stimulation by the adenovirus. Expression of CD30, which can be a marker for disease progression, was high in biopsy samples of our patients.","Panou, Evdoxia; Nikolaou, Vasiliki; Kaliampou, Stella; Sidiropoulou, Polytimi; Stratigos, Alexander",European Journal of Cancer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804921007553; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0959-8049(21)00755-3; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804921007553,470

Kaplan-Meier analysis displayed symptomatic infection (P < 0.001), fever (P = 0.006), pneumonia (P = 0.003) and lymphocyte counts <2.0 × 10(9)/L (P = 0.008) in children with COVID-19 were associated with prolonged duration of viral shedding in children with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Prolonged duration of viral shedding in children with COVID-19 was associated with symptomatic infection, fever, pneumonia and lymphocyte count less than 2.0 × 10(9)/L. Monitoring of symptoms could help to know the viral shedding in children with COVID-19.","Lu, Yingying; Li, Yi; Deng, Wenyue; Liu, Mingyang; He, Yuanzhi; Huang, Lingyue; Lv, Mengxue; Li, Jianxin; Du, Hao",Pediatr Infect Dis J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32379191/; https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002729,470

To minimize the risk of death and to allow those confirmed with COVID-19 to safely wait for hospitalization at home, the local government of Gyeonggi-do in South Korea developed a novel home management system (HMS). The HMS team, comprised of doctors and nurses, was organized to operate HMS. HMS provided a two-way channel for the taskforce and patients to monitor the severity of patient's condition and to provide healthcare counseling as needed. In addition, the HMS team cooperated with a triage/bed assignment team to expedite the response in case of an emergency, and managed a database of severity for real-time monitoring of patients. The HMS became operational for the first time in August 2020, initially managing only 181 patients; it currently manages a total of 3,707 patients. The HMS supplemented the government's COVID-19 confirmed case management framework by managing patients waiting at home for hospitalization due to lack of hospital and residential treatment center beds. HMS also could contribute a sense of psychological stability in patients and prevented the situation from worsening by efficient management of hospital beds and reduction of workloads on public healthcare centers. To stabilize and improve the management of COVID-19 confirmed cases, governments should organically develop self-treatment and HMS, and implement a decisive division of roles within the local governments.","Lee, Yeji; Han, Jin-Ok; Lee, Heeyoung; Lim, Seungkwan",J Korean Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34002552/,470

601608,Reevaluating chronic opioid monitoring during and after the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-09-18,"BACKGROUND: Remote reporting in anatomic pathology is an important advantage of digital pathology that has not been much explored. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an opportunity to explore this important application of digital pathology system in a tertiary care cancer center to ensure patient care and staff safety. Regulatory guidelines have been described for remote reporting following the pandemic. Herein, we describe our experience of validation of digital pathology workflow for remote reporting to encourage pathologists to utilize this facility which opens door for multiple, multidisciplinary collaborations. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the validation and the operational feasibility of remote reporting using a digital pathology system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our retrospective validation included whole-slide images (WSIs) of 60 cases of histopathology and 20 cases each of frozen sections and a digital image-based breast algorithm after a washout period of 3 months. Three pathologists with different models of consumer-grade laptops reviewed the cases remotely to assess the diagnostic concordance and operational feasibility of the modified workflow. The slides were digitized on a USFDA-approved Philips UFS 300 scanner at ×40 resolution (0.25 μm/pixel) and viewed on the Image Management System through a web browser. All the essential parameters were reported for each case. After successful validation, 886 cases were reported remotely from March 29, 2020, to June 30, 2020, prospectively. Light microscopy formed the gold standard reference in remote reporting. RESULTS: 100% major diagnostic concordance was observed in the validation of remote reporting in the retrospective and prospective studies using consumer-grade laptops. The deferral rate was 0.34%. 97.6% of histopathology and 100% of frozen sections were signed out within the turnaround time. Network speed and a lack of virtual private network did not significantly affect the study. CONCLUSION: This study of validation and reporting of complete pathology cases remotely, including their operational feasibility during a public health emergency, proves that remote sign-out using a digital pathology system is not inferior to WSIs on medical-grade monitors and light microscopy. Such studies on remote reporting open the door for the use of digital pathology for interinstitutional consultation and collaboration: Its main intended use.","Ramaswamy, Veena; Tejaswini, B.

METHODS: Self-taken nasal swabs from household contacts of PCR confirmed cases of COVID-19 and blood samples on day 35 were tested for evidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus. RESULTS: The secondary attack rate (SAR) among 431 contacts of 172 symptomatic index cases was 33% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 25-40) and was lower from primary cases without respiratory symptoms, 6% (CI 0-14) vs 37% (CI 29-45), p=0.030. The SAR from index cases <11 years was 25% (CI 12-38). SARs ranged from 16% (4-28) in contacts <11 years old to 36% (CI 28-45) in contacts aged 19-54 years (p=0.119). The proportion infected who developed symptoms (78%) was similar by age (p=0.44) though <19 year olds had fewer mean number of symptoms than adults (p=0.001) and fewer reported loss of sense of taste or smell (p=0.0001).

How this novel beta-coronavirus virus, and coronaviruses more generally, alter cellular metabolism to support massive production of ~30 kB viral genomes and subgenomic viral RNAs remains largely unknown. To gain insights, transcriptional and metabolomic analyses are performed 8 hours after SARS-CoV-2 infection, an early timepoint where the viral lifecycle is completed but prior to overt effects on host cell growth or survival. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 remodels host folate and one-carbon metabolism at the post-transcriptional level to support de novo purine synthesis, bypassing viral shutoff of host translation. Intracellular glucose and folate are depleted in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, and viral replication is exquisitely sensitive to inhibitors of folate and one-carbon metabolism, notably methotrexate. Host metabolism targeted therapy could add to the armamentarium against future coronavirus outbreaks.","Zhang, Yuchen; Guo, Rui; Kim, Sharon H.; Shah, Hardik; Zhang, Shuting; Liang, Jin Hua; Fang, Ying; Gentili, Matteo; Leary, Colin N.

Independently of baseline kidney function, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of COVID-19, associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Most frequently, COVID-19 causes acute tubular necrosis; however, in some cases, collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and direct viral tropism of the kidneys have also been documented. AKI secondary to COVID-19 has a multi-factorial origin. Even mild impairment of renal function is an independent risk factor for COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and mortality. Dialysis patients also carry an increased risk of other severe COVID-related complications, including arrhythmias, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute heart failure. In such patients, COVID-19 may even present with atypical clinical symptoms, including gastrointestinal disorders and deterioration of mental status. More research is needed on the exact effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the kidneys.

Phosphate release assay and FRET-based assay of the ADK analogues showed that the ADKs selectively inhibit the duplex DNA-unwinding activity without significant impact on the helicase ATPase activity. Also, antiviral activities of the ADKs were shown dependent upon the substituent. Taken together, these results suggest that there might be ADK-specific binding site in the SCV Hel, which warrants further investigations with diverse ADKs to provide valuable insights into rational design of specific SCV Hel inhibitors.","Lee, Chaewoon; Lee, Jin Moo; Lee, Na-Ra; Jin, Bong-Suk; Jang, Kyoung Jin; Kim, Dong-Eun; Jeong, Yong-Joo; Chong, Youhoon",Bioorg Med Chem Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19233643/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2009.02.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960894X09001528; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960894X09001528,470

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducted on patients with SARS-Co-V-2 infection, at a dedicated tertiary COVID-19 hospital in South India from April 1 to July 31, 2020. At the time of their admission to the COVID hospital, demographic data such as name, age, sex was recorded. A thorough history regarding the onset, duration, progression, nature of symptoms and its associated factors, medication history, treatment history were elicited and documented. Ocular examination was performed under torchlight by an ophthalmologist posted for COVID duty. Further investigations including imaging were sought for, depending on clinical indications. Serial follow-up examinations of all patients were carried out every 72 hours or when patients complained of any ocular symptoms whichever earlier, until discharge. All relevant data were compiled and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 2742 patients were examined. Of them, 1461 (53.28%) were males and 1281 (46.72%) were females. The mean age (±SD) was 39.46 ± 17.63 years. None of the patients in our study had any ocular symptoms or signs as the presenting complaint at the time of their admission. On subsequent follow-up, only 20 (0.72%) developed ocular manifestations, of which 19 (95%) had features suggestive of Bilateral viral conjunctivitis.

603443,Response of Practicing Chiropractors during the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Descriptive Report,2020-06-13,"Here, we report on a computational comparison of the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) on the spike proteins of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV in free forms and as complexes with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their receptor in humans. The impact of 42 mutations discovered so far on the structure and thermodynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RBD was also assessed. The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for ACE2 is higher than that of SARS-CoV RBD. The binding of COVA2-04 antibody to SARS-CoV-2 RBD is more energetically favorable than the binding of COVA2-39, but also less favorable than the formation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex. The net charge, the dipole moment and hydrophilicity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD are higher than those of SARS-CoV RBD, producing lower solvation and surface free energies and thus lower stability. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD is also more flexible and more open, with a larger solvent-accessible surface area than that of SARS-CoV RBD. Single-point mutations have a dramatic effect on distribution of charges, most prominently at the site of substitution and its immediate vicinity. These charge alterations alter the free energy landscape, while X→F mutations exhibit a stabilizing effect on the RBD structure through π stacking. F456 and W436 emerge as two key residues governing the stability and affinity of the spike protein for its ACE2 receptor. These analyses of the structural differences and the impact of mutations on different viral strains and members of the coronavirus genera are an essential aid in the development of effective therapeutic strategies.

603481,A dynamic scale for surgical activity (DYSSA) stratification during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-07-31,"The COVID-19 pandemic affected individuals, governments, and health care centers all around the globe. Social isolation obligation, restricted working shifts, and curfews posed unprecedented challenges for the population. Social isolation, boredom, and financial problems have been shown to stress peoples' mental health in previous comparable pandemics and even in regular situations. Individuals with a mental illness may particularly be at risk due to an already instable mental health status. While research mainly focused on the pandemic's impact on somatic health care and risk group patients, psychological obstacles caused by legal restrictions and their impact on already mentally affected individuals have been discussed, but so far only scarcely been investigated in a large sample. For this study, 12,028 people completed an online-survey during that time in Germany, when the COVID-19 outbreak gained momentum with a surge in cases and death rates as well as a lockdown of the public life. Generalized anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-2), distress (distress thermometer) and COVID-19-specific items, especially COVID-19-related fear, were assessed in healthy individuals, patients suffering from mental illnesses, and in patients with chronic somatic diseases, known to be at risk for an unfavorable course of COVID-19. Results show that the COVID-19-pandemic significantly worsens psychometric scores throughout the population - individuals with already heightened levels, like people with mental illnesses now reach concerning levels. Surprisingly, even though generalized anxiety, depressive symptoms, and perceived distress are elevated in individuals with mental illness, these individuals seem to be less affected by explicit COVID-19-related fear, than the general population or individuals with chronic somatic diseases. This study thus objectively quantifies the psychological impact of COVID-19 in a large sample and provides evidence for not only the public, but also critically affected individuals with a mental illness.","Skoda, Eva-Maria; Bäuerle, Alexander; Schweda, Adam; Dörrie, Nora; Musche, Venja; Hetkamp, Madeleine; Kohler, Hannah; Teufel, Martin; Weismüller, Benjamin",Int J Soc Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33040668/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020960773,470

This group was 11 times as likely to have no visitors than matched controls and reported higher levels of pain in delivery, lower newborn weights, and more infant admission to neonatal intensive care units. Visitor restrictions were associated with these birth outcomes. COVID-19 positive women with no visitors were 6 times as likely to report clinical acute stress in birth than COVID-19 positive women with visitors.

Chest CT data of 128 cases of COVID-19 and 47 cases of non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia confirmed by several hospitals were retrospectively collected, the imaging performance was evaluated and recorded, different imaging features were statistically analyzed, and a prediction model and independent predicted imaging features were obtained by multivariable analysis. COVID-19 was more likely than non-COVID-19 pneumonia to have a high-grade ground glass opacities (P = .01), extensive lesion distribution (P < .001), mixed lesions of varying sizes (27.7% vs 57.0%, P = .001), subpleural prominence (23.4% vs 86.7%, P < .001), and lower lobe prominence (48.9% vs 82.0%, P < .001). However, peribronchial interstitial thickening was more likely to occur in non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia (36.2% vs 19.5%, P = .022). The statistically significant differences from multivariable analysis were the degree of ground glass opacities (P = .001), lesion distribution (P = .045), lesion size (P = .020), subpleural prominence (P < .001), and lower lobe prominence (P = .041). The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 94.5% and 76.6%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.91. The imaging characteristics of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia are different, and the prediction model can further improve the specificity of chest CT diagnosis.","Zhang, Bo; Wang, Xia; Tian, Xiaoyan; Zhao, Xiaoying; Liu, Bin; Wu, Xingwang; Du, Yaqing; Huang, Guoquan; Zhang, Qing",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33080737/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000022747,470

Here, we show that a DNA vaccine encoding the first 725 amino acids (S1) of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein induces antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. With three immunizations, high titers of neutralizing antibodies (up to 1: 10(4)) were generated without adjuvant. DNA vaccination with the MERS-CoV S1 gene markedly increased the frequencies of antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells secreting IFN-γ and other cytokines. Both pcDNA3.1-S1 DNA vaccine immunization and passive transfer of immune serum from pcDNA3.1-S1 vaccinated mice protected Ad5-hDPP4-transduced mice from MERS-CoV challenge. These results demonstrate that a DNA vaccine encoding MERS-CoV S1 protein induces strong protective immune responses against MERS-CoV infection.","Chi, Hang; Zheng, Xuexing; Wang, Xiwen; Wang, Chong; Wang, Hualei; Gai, Weiwei; Perlman, Stanley; Yang, Songtao; Zhao, Jincun; Xia, Xianzhu",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.02.063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28314561/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17302888; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X17302888,470

Diagnosis and treatment guidelines for clinicians caring for patients are needed. In the early stage, we have issued “A rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)”; now there are many direct evidences emerged and may change some of previous recommendations and it is ripe for develop an evidence-based guideline. We formed a working group of clinical experts and methodologists. The steering group members proposed 29 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 covering the following areas: chemoprophylaxis, diagnosis, treatments, and discharge management. We searched the literature for direct evidence on the management of COVID-19, and assessed its certainty generated recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of ungraded consensus-based statement. Finally, we issued 34 statements. Among them, 6 were strong recommendations for, 14 were weak recommendations for, 3 were weak recommendations against and 11 were ungraded consensus-based statement. They covered topics of chemoprophylaxis (including agents and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) agents), diagnosis (including clinical manifestations, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respiratory tract specimens, IgM and IgG antibody tests, chest computed tomography, chest x-ray, and CT features of asymptomatic infections), treatments (including lopinavir-ritonavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, interferon, remdesivir, combination of antiviral drugs, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, interleukin-6 inhibitors, interleukin-1 inhibitors, glucocorticoid, qingfei paidu decoction, lianhua qingwen granules/capsules, convalescent plasma, lung transplantation, invasive or noninvasive ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), and discharge management (including discharge criteria and management plan in patients whose RT-PCR retesting shows SARS-CoV-2 positive after discharge).

606741,Factors Associated with Nurses Emotional Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-09-25,"ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) are small GTP-binding proteins that have an essential function in intracellular trafficking and organelle structure. To date, little information is available on the Arfs in the economically important giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii and their relationship to viral infection. Here we identified two Arf genes from M. rosenbergii (MrArf1 and MrArf2) for the first time. Phylogenetic analysis showed that MrArf1, together with MjArf1 from shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus belonged to Class I Arfs. By contrast, MrArf2 didn't not match any of the Arfs classes of I/II/III, although it could be clustered with an Arf protein from M. japonicas called MjArfn, which may represent an analog of the Arf. MrArf1 was ubiquitously expressed in all the examined tissues, with the highest transcription level in the hepatopancreas, whereas MrArf2 was only highly expressed in the hepatopancreas and exhibited very low levels in the heart, stomach, gills and intestine. The expression level of MrArf1 in the gills was down-regulated post 24 h WSSV challenge, and reached the maximal level at 48 h. MrArf1 in the hepatopancreas went up from 24 to 48 h WSSV challenge. MrArf2 transcript in the gill also went down at 24 h and then was upregulated at 48 h WSSV challenge. MrArf2 increased significantly in the hepatopancreas 24 h after infection and then went down at 48 h WSSV challenge. RNAi results showed that knockdown of MrArf1 or MrArf2 could inhibit the expression of the envelope protein gene vp28 of the WSSV. So, it could be speculated that MrArf1 and MrArf2 might play important roles in the innate immune system against WSSV infection.","Ding, Zheng-Feng; Ren, Jie; Tan, Jing-Min; Wang, Zheng; Yin, Shao-Wu; Huang, Ying; Huang, Xin; Wang, Wen; Lan, Jiang-Feng; Ren, Qian",Dev Comp Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2014.10.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145305X14002535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25451300/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145305X14002535,470

METHODS: A retrospective analytical cross‐sectional study was performed in our hospital, analyzing medical charts of all children under 2 years of age with a diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis admitted to our ED in the last years. Demographics and clinical data of patients affected with acute bronchiolitis during the 2020–2021 season—COVID‐19 outbreak—were compared to those of the 5 previous years. RESULTS: We observed an average drop of 84% of the rate of acute bronchiolitis managed by pediatricians in ED in 2020–2021 compared with bronchiolitis seasons of 5 previous years. We also reported, during the COVID‐19 outbreak, a higher number of children affected by acute bronchiolitis referred to ED as Emergency Consultations who required hospitalization. Regarding etiological agents, no differences in respiratory virus circulation, especially RSV, were observed in the two groups. The multivariate analysis showed no correlation between the diagnosis of RSV bronchiolitis and COVID‐19 period or prematurity; lower age was associated with an increased likelihood of exhibiting RSV bronchiolitis (odds ratio 0.9; 95% confidence interval 0.86–0.95 p < .01). CONCLUSION: Our data emphasize the reduction in the rate of admission to pediatric ED for acute bronchiolitis during the COVID‐19 outbreak, regardless of changes in circulating respiratory viruses. Therefore we want to highlight the importance of nonpharmacological preventive hygiene measures that should be maintained even at the end of the COVID‐19 outbreak.","Curatola, Antonietta; Lazzareschi, Ilaria; Bersani, Giulia; Covino, Marcello; Gatto, Antonio; Chiaretti, Antonio",Pediatr Pulmonol,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25442; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33961732/,470
607024,"Observations on the Occurrence, Transmission and Management of the COVID-19 Pandemic Derived from Physics",2021-01-16,"Glycyrrhizin (GL) is known to have various immunomodulating activities and has long been used clinically as an anti-allergic and anti-hepatitis agent. While the potency of GL against lung inflammatory diseases has been expected, the effect of GL on the lung has been poorly understood. Lung fibroblasts are known as a potent producer of inflammatory chemokines, IL-8 and eotaxin 1, by which neutrophils and eosinophils are strongly attracted during inflammation. Therefore, we studied the effects of GL on the production of these chemokines using a human fetal lung fibroblast cell line, HFL-1, stimulated with TNF-α and IL-4. Moreover, we examined the structure–activity relationships of GL to explore more beneficial compounds. 18α,β-GL inhibited IL-8 dose-dependently and inhibited eotaxin 1 slightly. 18α,β-Glycyrrhetic acid (GA) did not inhibit IL-8 but inhibited eotaxin 1. The effect of 18α,β-glycyrrhetic acid monoglucuronide (MGA) resembled that of 18α,β-GL but was weaker. Both 3β-[(2-O-β-d-glucopyranuronosyl-β-d-glucopyranuronosyl)oxy]-18β-11-deoxo-olean-12-en-30-oic acid (11-deoxo-GL) and 3β-[(2-O-β-d-glucopyranuronosyl-β-d-glucopyranuronosyl)oxy]-olean-11,13,(18)-dien-30-oic acid (hetero-GL) exhibited inhibitory activity with significant cytotoxicity. 3β-[(2-O-β-d-Glucopyranuronosyl-β-d-glucopyranuronosyl)oxy]-18β-olean-9,12-dien-30-oic acid (homo-GL) did not have cytotoxicity but its activity was mild like that of 18α,β-GL. 3β-[(2-O-β-d-Glucopyranuronosyl-β-d-glucopyranuronosyl)oxy]-olean-11,13(18)-dien-30-ol (hetero-30-OH-GL) and 3β-[(2-O-β-d-glucopyranuronosyl-β-d-glucopyranuronosyl)oxy]-18β-olean-9,12-dien-30-ol (homo-30-OH-GL) showed potent inhibitory effects, at concentrations lower than 18α,β-GL with no significant cytotoxicity. These results suggest that GL-related compounds are effective in reducing chemokine production and that GL-modified compounds including hetero-30-OH-GL and homo-30-OH-GL appear most beneficial in view of their inhibitory capacity with less cytotoxicity.","Matsui, Sachiko; Matsumoto, Hiroatsu; Sonoda, Yoshiko; Ando, Kumi; Aizu-Yokota, Eriko; Sato, Toshitsugu; Kasahara, Tadashi",Int Immunopharmacol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576904002498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15454116/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576904002498,470

This research contributes with a Multidimensional Assessment System of the Built Environment (MASBE) that provides an integral diagnosis on the perceived suitability of urban and housing environments for an ageing population, whose novel approach is structured and weighted through 35 multidisciplinary variables that are organised in seven dimensions: design, accessibility, comfort, maintenance, security and health, use and control, and stimulus. The system is applied and tested in reference case studies from Spain and Mexico, in order to demonstrate its operation and replicability. The weighted and displayed results help to identify the weaknesses and strengths of each application scale, obtaining average values far from 7.50, as the ideal value for ageing in place, and certain dimensions below 5.00, discussing through a sensitivity analysis the main influencing factors, health risks and major demands of elderly residents before deciding action strategies.

The patient returned from Angola, a non-epidemic country, with an infection of a new reassortant from different lineages of Rift Valley fever viruses (RVFVs). The patient developed multiorgan dysfunction and gradually recovered with continuous renal replacement therapy and a short regimen of methylprednisolone treatment. The disordered cytokines and chemokines in the plasma of the patient revealed hypercytokinemia, but the levels of protective cytokines were low upon admission and fluctuated as the disease improved. Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the imported strain was a reassortant comprising the L and M genes from lineage E and the S gene from lineage A. This case highlights that RVFV had undergone genetic reassortment, which could potentially alter its biological properties, cause large outbreaks and pose a serious threat to global public health as well as the livestock breeding industry.","Liu, Jingyuan; Sun, Yulan; Shi, Weifeng; Tan, Shuguang; Pan, Yang; Cui, Shujuan; Zhang, Qingchao; Dou, Xiangfeng; Lv, Yanning; Li, Xinyu; Li, Xitai; Chen, Lijuan; Quan, Chuansong; Wang, Qianli; Zhao, Yingze; lv, Qiang; Hua, Wenhao; Zeng, Hui; Chen, Zhihai; Xiong, Haofeng; Jiang, Chengyu; Pang, Xinghuo; Zhang, Fujie; Liang, Mifang; Wu, Guizhen; Gao, George F; Liu, William J; Li, Ang; Wang, Quanyi",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2016.136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28096531/,470

Self-compassion is put forth as a salutogenic perspective on oneself that buffers the adverse mental health impacts of these threats. During the peak of a local outbreak in Hong Kong in Spring 2020, 761 participants completed questionnaires on self-compassion, perceived threats, as well as perceived benefits and psychological distress. Controlling for demographic variables, negative indicators of self-compassion (aka self-coldness) was found to intensify the impacts of threats on psychological distress. The positive indicators of self-compassion also moderated the link between threats and perceived benefits, such that perceived benefits tend to be less related to threats in participants with higher self-compassion. Our findings highlight the impacts of both positive and negative indicators of self-compassion on the adjustment to such unprecedented challenges, and point to the possibility of enhancing people's resilience through fostering self-compassion and alleviating self-coldness.","Lau, Bobo Hi-Po; Chan, Cecilia Lai-Wan; Ng, Siu-Man",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.585270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33250793/,470

COVID‐related demands and hours worked were hypothesized to be positively related to mental health strain, whereas meaningful work and social support were hypothesized to be negatively related to mental health strain. Hours worked the prior week were hypothesized to exacerbate the positive relationships between COVID‐19 demands and mental health strain, whereas the resources of meaningful work and social support were expected to buffer the relationships. Multilevel models controlling for mental health strain the prior week revealed that COVID‐19 demands, along with hours worked, were each related to higher mental health strain during the week. Hours worked magnified the within‐person relationship between personal COVID‐19 demands and mental health strain. Contrary to hypotheses, social support and meaningful work were not related to mental health strain.

607898,COVID-19: District level vulnerability assessment in India,2020-09-03,"BACKGROUND: Parents of children with intellectual disability (ID) report comparatively lower levels of well‐being than parents of children without ID. Similarly, children with ID, and to a lesser extent their siblings, are reported to show comparatively higher levels of behaviour and emotional problems. Psychological problems may be accentuated by restrictions associated with the COVID‐19 pandemic, due to increased social, caring and economic stressors and reduced social support. However, existing studies have not been able to examine the impact of COVID‐19 restrictions accounting for pre‐COVID levels of well‐being in these families. In a naturalistic design, we examined outcomes for parents, siblings and children with ID in a two‐wave longitudinal study where Wave 2 data were gathered for some families before and some during COVID‐19 restrictions. METHODS: Parents of children with ID who took part in a Wave 2 survey pre‐lockdown (n = 294) and during/post‐lockdown (n = 103) completed a number of measures about their well‐being and the behaviour and emotional problems of both their child with ID and their nearest‐in‐age sibling. These same measures had also been completed for all families 2–3 years previously in Wave 1 of the study. RESULTS: After accounting for covariates including family socio‐economic circumstances, pre‐lockdown and post‐lockdown groups did not differ on Waves 1 to 2 change for measures of parental psychological distress, life satisfaction, the impact of caregiving on their lives or perceived positive gains; nor child or sibling internalising or externalising behaviour problems. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of the current study indicate that during and shortly after the COVID‐19 lockdown in the United Kingdom, well‐being in families of children with an ID (as reported by parents) was at similar levels compared with prior to the lockdown period.","Bailey, T.; Hastings, R.

This study was undertaken to test the association of TNF-α − 308 and IFN-γ + 874 gene polymorphisms with the susceptibility of Leishmania (L) species among CL patients in central region of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This is a case-control study involved 169 Saudi subjects with different L. species and 199 healthy controls from central region of Saudi Arabia. All subjects were characterized by TNF-α − 308 G/A and IFN-γ + 874 A/T gene polymorphisms using PCR. RESULTS: Evaluation of genotyping and allelic frequency of TNF-α − 308 G/A in different L. species showed no significant association compared to controls (p > 0.05). Except, in cases of L. tropica that showed significantly higher TNF-α − 308 A versus G allele frequency (p = 0.0004). Evaluation of genotyping of IFN-γ + 874 (TT versus AA+AT recessive) and allelic frequency of IFN-γ + 874 (T versus A) showed significant higher in L. major and also in total CL cases as compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). Furthermore, a strong association was observed between the susceptibility of L. major, L. tropica or total CL cases with synergistically combined high TNF-α 308/INF-γ 874 alleles. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that shows the gene polymorphisms of TNF-α − 308 G/A and IFN-γ + 874 A/T in Saudi patients with different L. species infections. Data showed that the TNF-α-308 G/A gene polymorphism is not associated with the susceptibility of CL in Saudi subjects. The only correlation was found in between A versus G allelic frequency in L. tropica. Importantly, IFN-γ + 874 A/T polymorphism was found to be associated with the susceptibility of L. major and also with total CL subjects. Moreover, data from synergistically combined high TNF-α 308/INF-γ 874 alleles strongly suggest their potential role in the susceptibility of leishmania infection.","Ahmed, Ahmed A.; Rasheed, Zafar; Salem, Tarek; Al-Dhubaibi, Mohammed S.; Al Robaee, Ahmad A.; Alzolibani, Abdullateef A.",BMC Med Genet,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12881-020-01043-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404058/,470

608775,Association of COVID-19-imposed lockdown and online searches for toothache in Iran,2021-02-15,"Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, which plays an essential role in both innate and adaptive immunity. However, the key molecular mechanisms that regulate SYK activity are poorly understood. Here we identified the E3 ligase TRIM31 as a crucial regulator of SYK activation. We found that TRIM31 interacted with SYK and catalyzed K27-linked polyubiquitination at Lys375 and Lys517 of SYK. This K27-linked polyubiquitination of SYK promoted its plasma membrane translocation and binding with the C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), and also prevented the interaction with the phosphatase SHP-1. Therefore, deficiency of Trim31 in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and macrophages (BMDMs) dampened SYK-mediated signaling and inhibited the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines against the fungal pathogen Candida albicans infection. Trim31(−/−) mice were also more sensitive to C. albicans systemic infection than Trim31(+/+) mice and exhibited reduced Th1 and Th17 responses. Overall, our study uncovered the pivotal role of TRIM31-mediated K27-linked polyubiquitination on SYK activation and highlighted the significance of TRIM31 in anti-C. albicans immunity.","Wang, Xueer; Zhang, Honghai; Shao, Zhugui; Zhuang, Wanxin; Sui, Chao; Liu, Feng; Chen, Xiaorong; Hou, Jinxiu; Kong, Lingli; Liu, Hansen; Zheng, Yi; Liu, Bingyu; Chen, Tian; Zhang, Lei; Jia, Xinming; Gao, Chengjiang",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00711-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34362877/,470

609928,Ongoing Global Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Endoscopy: A Subsequent International Survey of 121 Centers From 35 Countries (BRIEF REPORT),2021-09-23,"BACKGROUND: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to the postponement of low-acuity surgical procedures in an effort to conserve resources and ensure patient safety. This study aimed to characterize patient-reported concerns about undergoing surgical procedures during the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: We administered a cross-sectional survey to patients who had their general and plastic surgical procedures postponed at the onset of the pandemic, asking about barriers to accessing surgical care. Questions addressed dependent care, transportation, employment and insurance status, as well as perceptions of and concerns about COVID-19. Mixed methods and inductive thematic analyses were conducted. RESULTS: One-hundred and thirty-five patients were interviewed. We identified the following patient concerns: contracting COVID-19 in the hospital (46%), being alone during hospitalization (40%), facing financial stressors (29%), organizing transportation (28%), experiencing changes to health insurance coverage (25%), and arranging care for dependents (18%). Non-white participants were 5 and 2.5 times more likely to have concerns about childcare and transportation, respectively. Perceptions of decreased hospital safety and the consequences of possible COVID-19 infection led to delay in rescheduling. Education about safety measures and communication about scheduling partially mitigated concerns about COVID-19. However, uncertainty about timeline for rescheduling and resolution of the pandemic contributed to ongoing concerns. CONCLUSION: Providing effective surgical care during this unprecedented time requires both awareness of societal shifts impacting surgical patients and system-level change to address new barriers to care. Eliciting patients’ perspectives, adapting processes to address potential barriers, and effectively educating patients about institutional measures to minimize in-hospital transmission of COVID-19 should be integrated into surgical care.","Johnson, Christopher L.; Schwartz, Hope; Greenberg, Anya; Hernandez, Sophia; Nnamani Silva, Ogonna N.; Wong, Laura E.; Martins, Deborah B.; Broering, Jeanette M.; Kumar, Sandhya B.; Bongiovanni, Tasce; Wick, Elizabeth C.; Roman, Sanziana A.",J Surg Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33744775/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2021.01.028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002248042100055X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002248042100055X,470

However, the association between frailty and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) prognosis remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between frailty and mortality over 6 months in middle‐aged and older patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 and the association between acute morbidity severity and mortality across frailty strata. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Large academic medical center in Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1830 patients aged ≥50 years hospitalized with COVID‐19 (March–July 2020). MEASUREMENTS: We screened baseline frailty using the CFS (1–9) and classified patients as fit to managing well (1–3), vulnerable (4), mildly (5), moderately (6), or severely frail to terminally ill (7–9). We also computed a frailty index (0–1; frail >0.25), a well‐known frailty measure. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between frailty and time to death within 30 days and 6 months of admission. We also examined whether frailty identified different mortality risk levels within strata of similar age and acute morbidity as measured by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. RESULTS: Median age was 66 years, 58% were male, and 27% were frail to some degree. Compared with fit‐to‐managing‐well patients, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval [CI]) for 30‐day and 6‐month mortality were, respectively, 1.4 (1.1–1.7) and 1.4 (1.1–1.7) for vulnerable patients; 1.5 (1.1–1.9) and 1.5 (1.1–1.8) for mild frailty; 1.8 (1.4–2.3) and 1.9 (1.5–2.4) for moderate frailty; and 2.1 (1.6–2.7) and 2.3 (1.8–2.9) for severe frailty to terminally ill. The CFS achieved outstanding accuracy to identify frailty compared with the Frailty Index (area under the curve = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.93–0.95) and predicted different mortality risks within age and acute morbidity groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results encourage the use of frailty, alongside measures of acute morbidity, to guide clinicians in prognostication and resource allocation in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19.","Aliberti, Márlon Juliano Romero; Szlejf, Claudia; Avelino‐Silva, Vivian I.; Suemoto, Claudia Kimie; Apolinario, Daniel; Dias, Murilo Bacchini; Garcez, Flavia Barreto; Trindade, Carolina B.; Amaral, José Renato das Graças; de Melo, Leonardo Rabelo; de Aguiar, Renata Cunha; Coelho, Paulo Henrique Lazzaris; Hojaij, Naira Hossepian Salles de Lima; Saraiva, Marcos Daniel; da Silva, Natalia Oliveira Trajano; Jacob‐Filho, Wilson; Avelino‐Silva, Thiago J.",J Am Geriatr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33818759/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17146,470

Compared to other developing countries like India, it has special positive features of career incentives promoting growth at the local level, the ability to take long-term decisions relatively quickly, and a unique blend of political centralization and decentralization of economic power and responsibility, that is conducive to central guidance and local business development. On the other hand, with a lack of sufficient downward (as opposed to upward) accountability and absence of institutionalized systems of scrutiny and challenge from below, mistakes or abuse of power are more difficult to check and correct quickly, political loyalty may often get a premium over performance at the upper levels, and there are insufficient checks on collusion between business and officials. The over-all organizational system is prone to over-reaction in times of crisis and thus only weakly resilient compared to systems where information flows from below are less controlled or choked.","Bardhan, Pranab",China Economic Review,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043951X20300274; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X20300274,470

Air pressure measurements within prototypes were followed by prospective evaluation of 30 consecutive patients treated with the device assessed through questionnaires and monitoring oximetry. RESULTS: The NPFS is a transparent acrylic barrier with two anterior instrumentation ports and a side port to which continuous suction is applied. It is positioned on a stand and employs a disposable antimicrobial wrap to secure an enclosure around the head. This assembly was successfully used to complete transnasal laryngoscopy in all 30 patients studied. Tolerance of the design was excellent, with postprocedure questionnaire identifying no shortness of breath (27/30), no claustrophobia (27/30), no pain (29/30), and no significant changes in pulse oximetry. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic laryngoscopy was successfully performed in a negative pressure microenvironment created to limit dispersion of aerosols.

612352,International nurse education leaders’ experiences of responding to the COVID‐19 pandemic: A qualitative study,2021-06-09,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a public catastrophe and global concern. The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and lower respiratory tract infection signs. Almost all populations are susceptible to the virus, and the basic reproduction number (R(0)) is 2.8–3.9. The fight against COVID-19 should have two aspects: one is the treatment of infected patients, and the other is the mobilization of the society to avoid the spread of the virus. The treatment of patients includes supportive treatment, antiviral treatment, and oxygen therapy. For patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and circulatory support are recommended. Plasma therapy and traditional Chinese medicine have also achieved good outcomes. This review is intended to summarize the research on this new coronavirus, to analyze the similarities and differences between COVID-19 and previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and to provide guidance regarding new methods of prevention, diagnosis and clinical treatment based on autodock simulations. METHODS: This review compares the multifaceted characteristics of the three coronaviruses including COVID-19, SARS and MERS. Our researchers take the COVID-19, SARS, and MERS as key words and search literatures in the Pubmed database. We compare them horizontally and vertically which respectively means concluding the individual characteristics of each coronavirus and comparing the similarities and differences between the three coronaviruses. RESULTS: We searched for studies on each outbreak and their solutions and found that the main biological differences among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are in ORF1a and the sequence of gene spike coding protein-S. We also found that the types and severity of clinical symptoms vary, which means that the diagnosis and nursing measures also require differentiation. In addition to the common route of transmission including airborne transmission, these three viruses have their own unique routes of transmission such as fecal-oral route of transmission COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In evolutionary history, these three coronaviruses have some similar biological features as well as some different mutational characteristics. Their receptors and routes of transmission are not all the same, which makes them different in clinical features and treatments. We discovered through the autodock simulations that Met124 plays a key role in the efficiency of drugs targeting ACE2, such as remdesivir, chloroquine, ciclesonide and niclosamide, and may be a potential target in COVID-19.","Zhang, Xue-Yan; Huang, Hao-Jie; Zhuang, Dong-Lin; Nasser, Moussa Ide; Yang, Ming-Hua; Zhu, Ping; Zhao, Ming-Yi",Infect Dis Poverty,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32690096/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00691-6,470

The Canadian Community Health Survey (n = 2737), a transportation survey, and multiple secondary data sources were used to identify the environmental characteristics associated with older Quebecers’ social participation according to living area. Greater social participation was associated with: (1) a higher concentration of older adults (IRR = 2.172 (95% CI 1.600, 2.948); p < 0.001), more kilometers traveled by paratransit (IRR = 1.714 (95% CI 1.286, 2.285); p < 0.01), a lack of medical clinics (IRR = 0.730 (95% CI 0.574, 0.930); p = 0.01), and more funded home adaptations (IRR = 1.170 (95% CI 1.036, 1.320); p = 0.01) in large metropolitan areas; (2) larger paratransit fleets (IRR = 1.368 (95% CI 1.044, 1.791); p = 0.02) and a lower density of road intersections (IRR = 0.862 (95% CI 0.756, 0.982); p = 0.03) in regular metropolitan areas; (3) less social deprivation (IRR = 1.162 (95% CI 1.025, 1.318); p = 0.02) in urban areas; and (4) a higher concentration of older populations (IRR = 2.386 (95% CI 1.817, 3.133); p < 0.001) in rural areas.

METHODS: We performed an observational monocentric cohort study at the Adolphe de Rothschild Foundation Hospital ophthalmology division (Paris, France). Electronic medical records (EMR) data were searched for keywords associated with SLE, RA, SjS, or PsA. Patients were contacted by phone and were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire. The primary outcome was the occurrence of a positive COVID-19 test result during the study period. We determined the adjusted association between various antirheumatic drugs intake, COVID-19 risk factors, and occurrence of COVID-19 using a logistic regression model. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04345159). RESULTS: Patients were recruited between Apr 17, 2020, and Apr 30, 2020 and were recontacted between Oct 6, 2020, and Nov 2, 2020. A total of 569 patients were included, of whom 459 patients were eligible for data analysis. One hundred and eighty-one patients were treated with long-term HCQ and 18 patients had tested positive for COVID-19. No antirheumatic drug intake, including HCQ intake, was significantly associated with an increased or decreased risk of developing COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: No antirheumatic drug intake was associated with an increased or decreased risk of developing COVID-19 infection in our cohort of patients suffering from immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.","Guillaume, Debellemanière; Magalie, Bouvet; Sina, Elahi; Imène, Salah-Mabed; Frédéric, Vayr; Mathieu, Dubois; Aurore, Muselier; Yoni, Gozlan; Emma, Elbaz; Charlotte, Badatcheff; Laura, Fabre; Alain, Saad; Steven, Nahaisi; Pierre, Zeboulon; Jean-Luc, Febbraro; Romain, Courtin; Alice, Grise-Dulac; Adrien, Mazharian; Wassim, Ghazal; Pierre-Emmanuel, Remongin; Christophe, Panthier; Catherine, Chirouze; Kevin, Bertrand; Thomas, Sené; Damien, Gatinel",Rheumatol Ther,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40744-021-00373-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529226/,470

RECENT FINDINGS: Studies investigating the association between vitamin D levels and risk of COVID-19 infection and risk of severe disease and mortality among those infected have yielded mixed results. Thus far, the majority of studies investigating the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 have been observational and rely on vitamin D levels obtained at the time of admission, limiting causal inference. Currently, clinical trials assessing the effects of vitamin D supplementation in individuals with COVID-19 infection are extremely limited. Randomized, interventional trials may offer more clarity on the protective effects of vitamin D against COVID-19 infection and outcomes. SUMMARY: Decreased levels of vitamin D may amplify the inflammatory effects of COVID-19 infection, yet, data regarding the mortality benefits of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19-infected individuals are still limited. Current observational data provides the impetus for future studies to including randomized controlled trials to determine whether vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19-infected individuals with kidney disease can improve mortality outcomes.","Szeto, Betsy; Fan, Lena; Nickolas, Thomas L",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,https://doi.org/10.1097/mnh.0000000000000723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33990506/,470
613955,Post-Traumatic Growth among Older People after the Forced Lockdown for the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-09-10,"Among various vaccination strategies, peptide-based vaccines appear as excellent candidates because they are cheap to produce, are highly stable and harbor low toxicity. However, predicting which MHC-I Associated Peptide (MAP) will ultimately reach cell surface remains challenging, due to high false discovery rates. Previously, we demonstrated that synonymous codon arrangement (usage and placement) is predictive of, and modulates MAP presentation. Here, we apply CAMAP (Codon Arrangement MAP Predictor), the artificial neural network we used to unveil the role of codon arrangement in MAP presentation, to predict SARS-CoV MAPs. We report that experimentally identified SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 MAPs are associated with significantly higher CAMAP scores. Based on CAMAP scores and binding affinity, we identified 48 non-overlapping MAP candidates for a peptide-based vaccine, ensuring coverage for a high proportion of HLA haplotypes in the US population (>78%) and SARS-CoV-2 strains (detected in >98% of SARS-CoV-2 strains present in the GISAID database). Finally, we built an interactive web portal (https://www.epitopes.world) where researchers can freely explore CAMAP predictions for SARS-CoV-1/2 viruses. Collectively, we present an analysis framework that can be generalizable to empower the rapid identification of virus-specific MAPs, including in the context of an emergent virus, to help accelerate target identification for peptide-based vaccine designs that could be critical in safely attaining group immunity in the context of a global pandemic.","Daouda, Tariq; Dumont-Lagacé, Maude; Feghaly, Albert; Villani, Alexandra-Chloé",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.04.429819,470

Treatment with 100 or 1000 units/ml of IFN resulted in increased 2–5 A synthetase activity, but there was no significant response to 1 unit/ml of IFN. Titres of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were reduced between 6 and 15 hours post-infection in ST cells treated with 1000 or 2500 units/ml of IFN. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of lysates of TGEV-infected ST cells, and of lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-TGEV antibodies, revealed that the synthesis of the N and S proteins of TGEV was reduced in cells treated with 100 or 1000 units/ml of IFN. Viral RNA production, as determined with a probe which hybridized to the S gene of TGEV, was found to be reduced in ST cells treated with 1000 units/ml of IFN, but not in cells treated with 100 units/ml. It was concluded that, in IFN-treated ST cells, TGEV protein production may be decreased in the absence of reduced viral RNA production, and that 2–5 A synthetase may not be a significant factor in the antiviral activity of IFN against TGEV.","Jordan, L.

This study describes mental health issues among caregivers of young children and pregnant women in three urban informal settlements in Kenya during the first pandemic year, and factors associated with poor mental health. A cross-sectional telephone survey was administered to 845 participants. Survey instruments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, COVID-19 Anxiety Scale, and questions on the perceived COVID-19 effects on caregiver wellbeing and livelihood. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and univariate and multivariate analysis. Caregivers perceived COVID-19 as a threatening condition (94.54%), affecting employment and income activities (>80%). Caregivers experienced discrimination (15.27%) and violence (12.6%) during the pandemic. Levels of depression (34%), general anxiety (20%), and COVID-19 related anxiety (14%) were highly prevalent. There were significant associations between mental health outcomes and economic and socio-demographic factors, violence and discrimination experiences, residency, and perceptions of COVID-19 as a threatening condition.

In this study, an immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual radiography simulation tool was piloted in an undergraduate Radiography curriculum and user feedback retrieved. METHODS: The 3D virtual simulation tool by Virtual Medical Coaching Ltd was introduced to first year radiography students (n = 105). This technology guided students through a comprehensive process of learning anatomy, radiographic positioning and pathology. Students then X-rayed a virtual patient in the VR suite using HTC Vive Pro™ headsets and hand controllers. Instant feedback was provided. An online survey was later disseminated to students to gather user feedback. Thematic and descriptive statistical analyses were applied. RESULTS: A response rate of 79% (n = 83) was achieved. Most respondents (58%) reported enjoying VR simulation, whilst some felt indifferent towards it (27%). Ninety-four percent would recommend this tool to other students. The mean length of time it took for students to feel comfortable using the technology was 60 min (10–240 min). Most respondents (58%) desired more VR access. Students attributed enhanced confidence in the areas of beam collimation (75%), anatomical marker placement (63%), centring of the X-ray tube (64%) and exposure parameter selection (56%) to their VR practice. Many students (55%) advocated the use of VR in formative or low stakes assessments. Issues flagged included technical glitches, inability to palpate patient and lack of constructive feedback. CONCLUSION: Student feedback indicates that 3D virtual radiography simulation is a valuable pedagogical tool in radiography education IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: 3D immersive VR simulation is perceived by radiography students to be a valuable learning resource. VR needs to be strategically implemented into curricula to maximise its benefits.","O'Connor, M.; Stowe, J.; Potocnik, J.; Giannotti, N.; Murphy, S.; Rainford, L.",Radiography (Lond),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078817420301413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32800641/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078817420301413; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2020.07.017,470
614208,"Correction: Correlation between hospitalized patients’ demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, and COVID-19 pandemic in Bahia, Brazil",2021-03-11,"OBJECTIVE: Risk factors for in-hospital mortality in confirmed COVID-19 patients have been summarized in numerous meta-analyses, but it is still unclear whether they vary according to the age, sex and health conditions of the studied populations. This study explored these variables as potential mortality predictors. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted by searching the MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases of studies available through July 27, 2020. The pooled risk was estimated with the odds ratio (p-OR) or effect size (p-ES) obtained through random-effects meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were applied to explore differences by age, sex and health conditions. The MOOSE guidelines were strictly followed. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 60 studies, with a total of 51,225 patients (12,458 [24.3%] deaths) from hospitals in 13 countries. A higher in-hospital mortality risk was found for dyspnoea (p-OR = 2.5), smoking (p-OR = 1.6) and several comorbidities (p-OR range: 1.8 to 4.7) and laboratory parameters (p-ES range: 0.3 to -2.6). Age was the main source of heterogeneity, followed by sex and health condition. The following predictors were more markedly associated with mortality in studies with patients with a mean age ≤60 years: dyspnoea (p-OR = 4.3), smoking (p-OR = 2.8), kidney disease (p-OR = 3.8), hypertension (p-OR = 3.7), malignancy (p-OR = 3.7), diabetes (p-OR = 3.2), pulmonary disease (p-OR = 3.1), decreased platelet count (p-ES = -1.7), decreased haemoglobin concentration (p-ES = -0.6), increased creatinine (p-ES = 2.4), increased interleukin-6 (p-ES = 2.4) and increased cardiac troponin I (p-ES = 0.7). On the other hand, in addition to comorbidities, the most important mortality predictors in studies with older patients were albumin (p-ES = -3.1), total bilirubin (p-ES = 0.7), AST (p-ES = 1.8), ALT (p-ES = 0.4), urea nitrogen (p-ES), C-reactive protein (p-ES = 2.7), LDH (p-ES = 2.4) and ferritin (p-ES = 1.7). Obesity was associated with increased mortality only in studies with fewer chronic or critical patients (p-OR = 1.8). CONCLUSION: The prognostic effect of clinical conditions on COVID-19 mortality vary substantially according to the mean age of patients.

COVID-19 contains major structural proteins that among them, S protein can promote fusion of the viral and cellular membranes and facilitate the entry of coronavirus into the host cells. Basigin (BSG) is one of the most important receptors for COVID-19 that mediates its entry to host cells. Also, Basi- gin has an important role in male and female reproduction. Basigin is expressed in the uterus and plays an important role during embryo implantation and needed for successful implantation. Therefore, disruption or inhibition of Basigin causes to a weakness in embryo implantation. Therefore, if a woman or a man is infected with COVID-19, it is recommended that they do not attempt to conception until their treatment is complete. It is also recommended tests for COVID-19 be performed on infertile couples before using assisted reproductive technology (ART).","Mahdian, Soodeh; Shahhoseini, Maryam; Moini, Ashraf",Int J Fertil Steril,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33098397/; https://doi.org/10.22074/ijfs.2020.134702,470

Vulnerability factors (Socioeconomic Status, Minority Status & Language, Housing type, Transportation, Household Composition & Disability, Epidemiological Factors, Healthcare system Factors, High-risk Environments, and Population density) do not only influence an individual’s likelihood of getting infected but also influence the likelihood of his/her neighbors getting infected. Thus, spatial interactions occurring among individuals are likely to lead to spillover effects which may cause further virus transmission. METHODS: This research uses the COVID-19 community index (CCVI), which defines communities likely vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic and captures the multi-dimensionality of vulnerability. The spatial Durbin model was used to estimate the spillover effects of vulnerability to COVID-19 in U.S. counties, from May 1 to December 15, 2020. RESULTS: The findings confirm the existence of spatial spillover effects; with indirect effects (from neighboring counties) dominating the direct effects (from county-own vulnerability level). This not only validates social distancing as a strategy to contain the spread of the pandemic but also calls for comprehensive and coordinated approach to fight its effects. By keeping vulnerability factors constant but varying the number of reported infected cases every 2 weeks, we found that marginal effects of vulnerability vary significantly across counties. This might be the reflection of both the changing intensity of the pandemic itself but also the lack of consistency in the measures implemented to combat it. CONCLUSION: Overall, the results indicate that high vulnerability in Minority, Epidemiological factors, Healthcare System Factors, and High-Risk Environments in each county and adjacent counties leads to an increase in COVID-19 confirmed cases.

Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. As with domestic violence, we need to look for these symptoms in order to enable management. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.","Mengin, Amaury; Alle, Mélissa; Rolling, Julie; Ligier, Fabienne; Schroder, Carmen; Lalanne, Laurence; Berna, Fabrice; Jardri, Renaud; Vaiva, Guillaume; Geoffroy, Pierre A; Brunault, Paul; Thibaut, Florence; Chevance, Astrid; Giersch, Anne",Encephale,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620300750?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32370983/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620300750,470

At the same time, social distance, physical distance and physical distancing have become current in the same context. This paper examines these terms in (samples of) four corpora of British English (BNC, ukWaC, NOW 2019 and NOW 2020), with the following aims: (i) to study the frequency and usage of these phrases in corpora of different kinds, representing texts created both before and during the Covid-19 pandemic; (ii) to determine whether the recent spread of the phrases in the Covid-19 context has entailed any shifts in the collocational profile of the constituent words. By looking at the most frequent collocations over time we establish to what extent the corpora reflect stability and change in patterning and to what extent the external factor of the pandemic outbreak has far reaching consequences for the lexical semantics of the language. The case of social distance/distancing has special relevance to accounts of semantic change through the sudden and radical shifts in the collocational profile of the items concerned.","Butler, Christopher S.; Simon-Vandenbergen, Anne-Marie",Corpus Pragmat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34222774/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41701-021-00107-2,470

Some of their functions include contractility, locomotion, collagen and elastin fiber production, and the regulation and degradation of the extracellular matrix. Also, fibroblasts act as sentinels to produce inflammatory mediators in response to several microorganisms. There is evidence that fibroblasts can synthesize toll-like receptors (TLRs), antimicrobial peptides, proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, which are important molecules involved in innate immune response against microorganisms. Fibroblasts can express TLRs (TLR-1 to TLR-10) to sense microbial components or microorganisms. They can synthesize antimicrobial peptides, such as LL-37, defensins hBD-1, and hBD-2, molecules that perform antimicrobial activity. Also, they can produce proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, INFγ, IL-6, IL-12p70, and IL-10; other chemokines, such as CCL1, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL10, and CX3CL1; and the growth factors granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to induce and recruit inflammatory cells. According to their immunological attributes, we can conclude that fibroblasts are sentinel cells that recognize pathogens, induce the recruitment of inflammatory cells via cytokines and growth factors, and release antimicrobial peptides, complying with the characteristics of real sentinels.","Bautista-Hernández, Luis Antonio; Gómez-Olivares, José Luis; Buentello-Volante, Beatriz; Bautista-de Lucio, Victor Manuel",Eur J Microbiol Immunol (Bp),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29034104/; https://doi.org/10.1556/1886.2017.00009,470

The frequency of GI symptoms ranges from 16% to 61%. Although COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are related to pulmonary disease, poor outcomes have been linked to GI symptoms. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the outcomes of COVID-19 patients who presented with GI symptoms. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study at Isra University Hospital in Hyderabad, Pakistan, from April 2020 to October 2020. Results In total, 395 polymerase chain reaction-positive individuals were included. No differences in age or comorbidities were found. Of the 84 patients who needed intensive care unit admission, 17 had GI symptoms (P= 0.357). Moreover, GI symptoms were reported in 9/42 patients who required mechanical ventilation (P = 0.674) and 35/184 patients who required non-invasive ventilation (P = 0.029).

618897,Depressive symptoms among Peruvian adult residents amidst a National Lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-02-18,"The immune system is intricately regulated allowing potent effectors to expand and become rapidly mobilized after infection, while simultaneously silencing potentially detrimental responses that averts immune-mediated damage to host tissues. This relies in large part on the delicate interplay between immune suppressive regulatory CD4(+) T (Treg) cells and immune effectors that without active suppression by Treg cells cause systemic and organ-specific autoimmunity. Although these beneficial roles have been classically described as counterbalanced by impaired host defence against infection, newfound protective roles for Treg cells against specific viral pathogens (e.g. herpes simplex virus 2, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, West Nile virus) have been uncovered using transgenic mice that allow in vivo Treg-cell ablation based on Foxp3 expression. In turn, Foxp3(+) Treg cells also provide protection against some parasitic (Plasmodium sp., Toxoplasma gondii) and fungal (Candida albicans) pathogens. By contrast, for bacterial and mycobacterial infections (e.g. Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), experimental manipulation of Foxp3(+) cells continues to indicate detrimental roles for Treg cells in host defence. This variance is probably related to functional plasticity in Treg cell suppression that shifts discordantly following infection with different types of pathogens. Furthermore, the efficiency whereby Treg cells silence immune activation coupled with the plasticity in Foxp3(+) cell activity suggest that overriding Treg-mediated suppression represents a prerequisite ‘signal zero’ that together with other stimulation signals [T-cell receptor (signal 1), co-stimulation (signal 2), inflammatory cytokines (signal 3)] are essential for T-cell activation in vivo. Herein, the importance of Foxp3(+) Treg cells in host defence against infection, and the significance of infection-induced shifts in Treg-cell suppression are summarized.","Rowe, Jared H; Ertelt, James M; Way, Sing Sing",Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22211994/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2011.03551.x,470

Anaesthesia for category 1 caesarean section during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-06-09,"The frequency of colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis has decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Health system planning is needed to address the backlog of undiagnosed patients. We developed a framework for analyzing barriers to diagnosis and estimating patient volumes under different system relaunch scenarios. This retrospective study included CRC cases from the Alberta Cancer Registry for the pre-pandemic (1 January 2016–4 March 2020) and intra-pandemic (5 March 2020–1 July 2020) periods. The data on all the diagnostic milestones in the year prior to a CRC diagnosis were obtained from administrative health data. The CRC diagnostic pathways were identified, and diagnostic intervals were measured. CRC diagnoses made during hospitalization were used as a proxy for severe disease at presentation. A modified Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted relative risk (adjRR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the effect of the pandemic on the risk of hospital-based diagnoses. During the study period, 8254 Albertans were diagnosed with CRC. During the pandemic, diagnosis through asymptomatic screening decreased by 6·5%. The adjRR for hospital-based diagnoses intra-COVID-19 vs. pre-COVID-19 was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.49). Colonoscopies were identified as the main bottleneck for CRC diagnoses. To clear the backlog before progression is expected, high-risk subgroups should be targeted to double the colonoscopy yield for CRC diagnosis, along with the need for a 140% increase in monthly colonoscopy volumes for a period of 3 months. Given the substantial health system changes required, it is unlikely that a surge in CRC cases will be diagnosed over the coming months. Administrators in Alberta are using these findings to reduce wait times for CRC diagnoses and monitor progression.","Walker, Emily; Fu, Yunting; Sadowski, Daniel C.; Stewart, Douglas; Tang, Patricia; Kaposhi, Bethany; Chappell, Heather; Robson, Paula; Veldhuyzen van Zanten, Sander",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501687/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179098,470

619690,"COVID-19 pandemic: an online-based survey of knowledge, perception, and adherence to preventive measures among educated Nigerian adults",2021-01-07,"BACKGROUND: India bears the second largest burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A multitude of RT-PCR detection assays with disparate gene targets including automated high throughput platforms are available. Varying concordance and interpretation of diagnostic results in this setting can result in significant reporting delays leading to suboptimal disease management. Here, we report the development of a novel ORF-1a based SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay, Viroselect, showing high concordance with conventional assays and the ability to resolve inconclusive results generated during the peak of the epidemic in Mumbai, India. METHODS: We identified a unique target region within SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a, non-structural protein (nsp3), that was used to design and develop our assay. This hypervariable region (1923-3956) between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV was utilized to design our primers and probe for RT-PCR assay. We further evaluated concordance of our assay with commonly used EUA (USFDA) manual kits as well as an automated high throughput testing platform. Further, a retrospective analysis using Viroselect on samples reported as ‘inconclusive’ during April-October 2020 was carried out. RESULTS: A total of 701 samples were tested. Concordance analysis of 477 samples demonstrated high overall agreement of Viroselect assay with both manual (87.6%; 95% CI) as well as automated (84.7%; 95% CI) testing assays. Also, in the retrospective analysis of 224 additional samples reported as ‘inconclusive’, Viroselect was able to resolve 100% (19/19) and 93.7% (192/205) samples which were termed inconclusive by manual and automated high throughput platform respectively. CONCLUSION: We show that Viroselect had high concordance with conventional assays, both manual and automated, as well as highlight its potential in resolving inconclusive samples.","Jawade, Ketki; Sinha, Akhauri Yash; Bhagat, Sharad; Bhowmick, Shilpa; Chauhan, Bhagyashree; Kaginkar, Snehal; Palav, Harsha; Kasarpalkar, Nandini; Devadiga, Pratik; Karandikar, Kalyani; Agarwal, Sachee; Shastri, Jayanthi; Munne, Kiran; Bhor, Vikrant M.; Mahale, Smita D.; Bhowmik, Subhanjan; Jagtap, Dhanashree; Patel, Vainav",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221003179; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.04.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221003179?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33852938/,470

620294,Online behavioural activation during the COVID-19 pandemic decreases depression and negative affective bias,2021-08-17,"OBJECTIVE(S): Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents an enormous challenge to healthcare systems globally. Optimizing access to healthcare while minimizing face-to-face patient encounters is critical to limiting exposures, conserving resources, and preserving health. We aimed to evaluate the utility of a COVID-focused telehealth program in avoiding potential in-person visits while maintaining high patient satisfaction. METHODS: All patients with COVID-related virtual visits at our center between March and May 2020 were included. Demographic, satisfaction, and clinical information were gathered using a modified, validated telehealth satisfaction questionnaire disseminated via email or telephone. Data were analyzed using Stata. RESULTS: Of 581 eligible patients, 180 (31%) responded to the survey. Symptoms (73%) and possible exposure (22%) were the main reasons cited for pursuing a virtual visit; cough (44%) and fever (36%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Regarding patient satisfaction, most patients rated the experience as “very good” or “excellent”, and 94% of respondents said they would recommend COVID-focused triage through telehealth to others. Over 81% of patients indicated that, if telehealth was not an option, they would have sought an in-person encounter. Ultimately, only 27% of patients reported pursuing a face-to-face encounter after participating in the virtual visit. CONCLUSION: Based on patient self-reporting, telemedicine potentially prevented face-to-face COVID-related encounters. Patients expressed satisfaction with the virtual process and were less likely to pursue in-person consultation. Leveraging a telehealth strategy for forward triage has the potential to reduce exposures while conserving healthcare resources.","Gupta, Vikas S.; Popp, Elizabeth C.; Garcia, Elisa I.; Qashqai, Sahar; Ankrom, Christy; Wu, Tzu-Ching; Harting, Matthew T.",Healthc (Amst),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hjdsi.2021.100567; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213076421000506; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213076421000506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34274883/,470
620412,Suicidal Ideation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Insomnia,2020-05-27,"Background: In the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases started to emerge in local hospitals in Wuhan, China. This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created. Cumulation number of patients at the end of period 1 (day50) is 2868.7 ± 1739.0. Total infected patients could be 913396.5 ± 559099.9 by the end of period 2 (day70) in free transmission state. And at day90, total patients number is 913396.5 ± 559099.9. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a novel severe respiratory disease. This will put great burden on the shoulder of healthcare workers as well as on medical hardware and supplements. Current strict control measures help to contain disease from spreading. An early detecting, reporting and fast reacting system needs to be setup to prevent future unknown infectious disease.","ZHOU, Guopeng; CHI, Chunhua",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023168,470

However, there is paucity of data in developing countries. Hence, this study aims to assess the prevalence of early postnatal discharge during COVID-19 in Jimma Health Centers. METHODS: Facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 February to 30 March 2021. Sample was calculated using single population proportion formula and allocated proportionally to the health centers. Data were interred into Epidata version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 22.0 for analysis. Multivariable regression was done to identify associating factors at p < 0.05. RESULT: Three hundred ninety women were included into study making a response rate of 96.8%. Early discharge prevalence was 316 (81.0%). Attending elementary school adjusted odds ratio = 0.26 (confidence interval = 0.087–0.798), plan for postnatal care within a week adjusted odds ratio = 0.410 (confidence interval = 0.221–0.760), knowing postnatal maternal danger sign adjusted odds ratio = 0.258 (confidence interval = 0.141–0.473), women adjusted odds ratio = 0.421 (confidence interval = 0.211–0.838), or husband adjusted odds ratio = 0.051 (confidence interval = 0.014–0.186) made decision of discharge were negatively and distance on foot <30 min adjusted odds ratio = 3 (confidence interval = 1.121–8.058) was positively associated with early discharge significantly.

Study Design The clinical course of two women hospitalized with ARDS due to COVID-19 care in our intensive care (ICU) is summarized; both participants provided consent to be included in this case series. Results Both women recovered with no clinical sequelae. Neonatal outcomes were within the realm of expected for prematurity with the exception of coagulopathy. There was no vertical transmission to the neonates. Conclusion This case series highlights that ECMO is a feasible treatment in the pregnant woman with severe COVID-19 and that delivery can be performed safely on ECMO with no additional risk to the fetus. While ECMO carries its natural risks, it should be considered a viable option during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Key Points: COVID-19 may present with a more severe course in pregnancy. ECMO may be used in pregnant woman with severe COVID-19. Delivery can be performed on ECMO without added fetal risk.","Douglass, K.

621933,The Experiences of Primary Healthcare Nurses During the COVID‐19 Pandemic in Australia,2020-07-31,"A hydrophobic gadolinium-based magnetic ionic liquid (MIL) was investigated for the first time as an extraction solvent in dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (DLLME). The tested MIL was composed of trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium cations and paramagnetic gadolinium chloride anions. The prepared MIL showed low water miscibility, reasonable viscosity, markedly high magnetic susceptibility, adequate chemical stability, low UV background, and compatibility with reversed-phase HPLC solvents. These features resulted in a more efficient extraction than the corresponding iron or manganese analogues. Accordingly, the overall method sensitivity and reproducibility were improved, and the analysis time was reduced. The applicability of the proposed MIL was examined through the microextraction of four sartan antihypertensive drugs from aqueous samples followed by reversed-phase HPLC with UV detection at 240 nm. The DLLME procedures were optimized for disperser solvent type, MIL mass, disperser solvent volume, as well as acid, base, and salt addition. The limits of quantitation (LOQs) obtained with the analysis of 1.2-mL samples after DLLME and HPLC were 80, 30, 40, and 160 ng/mL for azilsartan medoxomil, irbesartan, telmisartan, and valsartan, respectively. Correlation coefficients were greater than 0.9988 and RSD values were in the range of 2.48–4.07%. Under the optimized microextraction conditions and using a 5-mL sample volume, enrichment factors were raised from about 40 for all sartans using a 1.2-mL sample to 175, 176, 169, and 103 for azilsartan medoxomil, irbesartan, valsartan, and telmisartan, respectively. The relative extraction recoveries for the studied sartans in river water varied from 82.5 to 101.48% at a spiked concentration of 0.5 μg/mL for telmisartan and irbesartan and 1 μg/mL for azilsartan medoxomil and valsartan.

622845,Risks of viral contamination in healthcare professionals during laparoscopy in the Covid-19 pandemic,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation may be used as a potential bridge to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), or as a ceiling-of-care for persistent hypoxaemia despite standard oxygen therapy, according to UK guidelines. We examined the association of mode of respiratory support and ceiling-of-care on mortality. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of routinely collected de-identified data of adults with nasal/throat SARs-CoV-2 swab-positive results, at the Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust between 10th March-19th April 2020 (outcomes determined on 22nd May). FINDINGS: Of 347 patients with SARs-CoV-2 swab-positive results, 294 (84.7%) patients admitted for Covid-19 were included in the study. Sixty-nine patients were trialled on CPAP, mostly delivered by face mask, either as an early ceiling of care instituted within 24 hours of admission (N = 19), or as a potential bridge to IMV (N = 44). Patients receiving a ceiling of care more than 24 hours after admission (N = 6) were excluded from the analysis. Two hundred and fifteen patients (73.1%) maximally received air/standard oxygen therapy, and 45 (15.3%) patients maximally received CPAP. Thirty-four patients (11.6%) required IMV, of which 24 had received prior CPAP. There were 138 patients with an early ceiling-of-care plan (pre-admission/within 24h). Overall, 103(35.0%) patients died and 191(65.0%) were alive at study end. Among all patients trialled on CPAP either as a potential bridge to IMV (N = 44) or as a ceiling-of-care (N = 19) mortality was 25% and 84%, respectively. Overall, there was strong evidence for higher mortality among patients who required CPAP or IMV, compared to those who required only air/oxygen (aOR 5.24 95%CI: 1.38, 19.81 and aOR 46.47 95%CI: 7.52, 287.08, respectively; p<0.001), and among patients with early ceiling-of-care compared to those without a ceiling (aOR 41.81 95%CI: 8.28, 211.17; p<0.001). Among patients without a ceiling of care (N = 137), 10 patients required prompt intubation following failed oxygen therapy, but 44 patients received CPAP. CPAP failure, defined as death (N = 1) or intubation (N = 24), occurred in 57% (N = 25) of patients. But in total, 75% (N = 33) of those started on CPAP with no ceiling of care recovered to discharge—19 without the need for IMV, and 14 following IMV. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that among patients with no ceiling-of-care, an initial trial of CPAP as a potential bridge to IMV offers a favourable therapeutic alternative to early intubation. In contrast, among patients with a ceiling-of care, CPAP seems to offer little additional survival benefit beyond oxygen therapy alone. Information on ceilings of respiratory support is vital to interpreting mortality from Covid-19. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY: Sample size relatively small. Study sample representative of hospitalised Covid-19 patients in UK. Previously unreported data on role of ceilings-of-care in hospitalised Covid-19 patients.

The aim of this study was to conduct an initial exploration of the reasons for using digital platforms in blood donation. Using a Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) framework, microdata for 389 participants from Latin American countries and Spain, and Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), the study obtained three main prediction paths. The first two started from feelings of trust in the digital community and a positive mood state associated with a modern lifestyle, and they were linked to attitudes and behavioural control in the explanation of the intention to donate and actual blood donation. The third path started from modern lifestyles, and was linked to the subjective norm in the prediction of intention and actual donation. These paths represent one of the very first attempts to predict intentions of donation and collaborative donation by taking a PLS-SEM approach. By determining the paths underpinning collaborative blood donors’ motives, the results of this study provide strong support for the usefulness of the TPB model within the context of digital platform use and blood donation.","Torrent-Sellens, Joan; Salazar-Concha, Cristian; Ficapal-Cusí, Pilar; Saigí-Rubió, Francesc",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18084270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33920606/,470

Facing this critical situation, health care workers on the front line who are directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms including emotional disturbance. OBJECTIVE: the aim of this study will be to assess the current state of emotional responses and perceived stressors of frontline medical staffs in case of Addis Ababa COVID-19 Treatment Centers and obstetrics emergency and abortion care, Ethiopia 2020. METHODS: Hospital based comparative cross-section study design was conducted by using self-administered questionnaire survey from June 1st to 30th of 2020 among 133 and 266 frontline medical staffs from obstetric emergency and abortion care clinic and COVID-19 treatment centers respectively. The data were collected after getting written consent from each participant and it entered into the computer using Epi-data version 7, then exported to SPSS version 20 for further analysis. Descriptive analysis was done using frequencies & percent. All independent determinants with P-value < 0.05 were used to identify important predictors of emotional responses and perceived stressors. RESULT: A total of 399 frontline medical staffs were included in the study. The mean age of the respondents of those who were working in obstetrics emergency and abortion care clinic was 27.47 (SD, 3.46) years and it was 28.12 (SD, 4.09) years for the other groups. This study revealed that, 72.9 and 5.6% of the study participant from obstetrics emergency and abortion clinic and COVID-19 treatment centers had a positive emotional response, respectively. Factors such as having a low level of motivational factors (AOR 2.78, 95% CI (1.13, 6.84)), being a nurse (AOR 10.53, 95% CI (1.31, 85.26)) and working at triage (AOR 8.61, 95% CI (1.15, 64.81))) had statistically significant association with negative emotional response. CONCLUSION: The current study revealed that a high proportion of front line a negative emotional responses had negative emotional response.

624853,The Prospective Influence of COVID-19 Affective Risk Assessments and Intolerance of Uncertainty on Later Dimensions of Health Anxiety,2020-08-12,"Cholera was a major global scourge in the 19(th) century, with frequent large-scale epidemics in European cities primarily originating in the Indian subcontinent. John Snow conducted pioneering investigations on cholera epidemics in England and particularly in London in 1854 in which he demonstrated that contaminated water was the key source of the epidemics. His thorough investigation of an epidemic in the Soho district of London led to his conclusion that contaminated water from the Broad Street pump was the source of the disease and, consequently, the removal of the handle led to cessation of the epidemic. He further studied cholera in London homes that were receiving water from two water supply systems; one from the sewage contaminated portion of the Thames River and the other that drew its water upstream from an uncontaminated part of the river. Rates of infection among clients of the distribution system drawing contaminated water far exceeded the, rates among those served by the company whose water intake was from above the contaminated section of the river. This demonstration reinforced the goals of the sanitation movement, which developed sewage drainage systems and water purification systems in cities and towns in the following decades, therewith vastly reducing the threats of cholera, typhoid and many other waterborne diseases. Despite progress being made globally, the public health problems of waterborne disease, including cholera, are by no means gone today, even in high-income countries. The tragic introduction of cholera after the earthquake devastation in Haiti in 2010 resulted in many thousands of cases and deaths from cholera indicating the still-present dangers of diseases spread into disaster situations. Cholera and other waterborne diseases remain some of the heaviest burdens of disease and death in low-income countries, especially after natural disasters or warfare as in Yemen in 2017 and are continuing challenges for global health.","Tulchinsky, Theodore H.",Case Studies in Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128045718000172; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128045718000172,470

Nonstructural protein 10 (nsp10) is a superfamily 1 helicase participating in multiple processes of virus replication and one of the three most conserved proteins in nidoviruses. Here we report three high resolution crystal structures of highly pathogenic PRRSV nsp10. PRRSV nsp10 has multiple domains, including an N-terminal zinc-binding domain (ZBD), a β-barrel domain, a helicase core with two RecA-like domains, and a C-terminal domain (CTD). The CTD adopts a novel fold and is required for the overall structure and enzymatic activities. Although each domain except the CTD aligns well with its homologs, PRRSV nsp10 adopts an unexpected extended overall structure in crystals and solution. Moreover, structural and functional analyses of PRRSV nsp10 versus its closest homolog, equine arteritis virus nsp10, suggest that DNA binding might induce a profound conformational change of PRRSV nsp10 to exert functions, thus shedding light on the mechanisms of activity regulation of this helicase.","Tang, Chenjun; Deng, Zengqin; Li, Xiaorong; Yang, Meiting; Tian, Zizi; Chen, Zhenhang; Wang, Guoguo; Wu, Wei; Feng, Wen-hai; Zhang, Gongyi; Chen, Zhongzhou",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32075207/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12020215,470
625115,Impact of COVID‐19 pandemic restrictions on the cardio‐respiratory health of New Zealanders,2021-08-08,"BACKGROUND: In the lung, melanoma is mostly arranged as patterns of multiple nodules, solitary nodules, or miliary invasions. Very rarely, it also displays a “crazy paving” pattern (also described as a “paving stone,” “flagstone,” or “slabstone” pattern), which is rarer still in discrete bilateral nodules. This pattern is considered to be caused by pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, but its association with various diseases is unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with pulmonary melanoma. Computed tomography revealed discrete bilateral nodules surrounded by a “paving” pattern. A literature review found more than 40 types of diseases that have presented with “paving” patterns in the lung—predominantly pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, viral pneumonia, exogenous lipoid pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis, interstitial pneumonia, ARDS, squalene aspiration pneumonia, radiation pneumonitis, drug-induced pneumonitis, pulmonary leptospirosis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and pulmonary nocardiosis. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the first case of pulmonary melanoma in the form of discrete bilateral nodules accompanied with a computed tomography paving pattern. Although pulmonary paving patterns are rare, more than 40 diseases reportedly display them; clinicians should consider melanoma of the lung in differential diagnoses for patients who show such a pattern.","Feng, Yikuan; Zhao, Jianping; Yang, Qun; Xiong, Weining; Zhen, Guohua; Xu, Yongjian; Zhang, Zhenxiang; Zhang, Huilan",BMC Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27488496/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-016-2630-5,470

The spectrum of disease seen in patients with COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe pneumonia and even acute respiratory distress syndrome, which often requires invasive ventilation and intensive care. COVID-19-associated infection can be catastrophic, leading to both arterial and venous occlusion, microinfarcts, and multiorgan failure, although retinal vein occlusion has not yet been reported. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 40-year-old man who presented with a 3-day history of shortness of breath, cough, and fever. He also reported right calf pain and blurring of vision in both eyes. His medical history included hypertension and morbid obesity. The patient was found to have severe COVID-19 pneumonia on high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, right leg deep venous thrombosis on Doppler ultrasonography, and bilateral central retinal vein occlusion (RVO) on fundal examination. He was started on full-dose anticoagulation and discharged on rivaroxaban for 3 months. After 2 weeks of therapy, he had fully recovered from his COVID-19 symptoms and had near-normal vision. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection can cause RVO. Early full-dose anticoagulation should be considered in high-risk patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Ophthalmologists and other clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for RVO in patients with COVID-19 infection who presenting with blurred vision and severe pneumonia.","Gaba, Waqar Haider; Ahmed, Deena; Nuaimi, Rawdha Khaleefa Al; Dhahani, Aishah Ali Al; Eatmadi, Habibullah",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33116072/; https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.927691,470

Upon physical examination, a 2‐mm‐diameter focal area of opacity was noted in the left cornea. In addition, the ferret was quiet, in poor body condition, and dehydrated. A complete blood count and plasma biochemistry revealed a severe nonregenerative anemia, azotemia, hyperproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and mild hyperphosphatemia and hyperchloremia. Urinalysis revealed hyposthenuria. Whole body radiographs showed multifocal thoracic nodular disease, splenomegaly, and renomegaly. Abdominal ultrasonography confirmed bilaterally enlarged kidneys, hypoechoic liver and spleen, and a caudal abdominal hypoechoic mobile nodule. The ferret was humanely euthanized, and a postmortem examination with subsequent histopathology showed multifocal necrotizing pyogranulomas in the lung, spleen, kidneys, mesenteric lymph nodes, and serosa of the duodenum. Pyogranulomatous panophthalmitis was diagnosed in the left eye. The multisystemic granulomatous lesions were suggestive of ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV). The presence of coronavirus in the left eye was confirmed by positive immunohistochemistry. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue from the lung, spleen, and kidney was negative for FRSCV and positive for ferret enteric coronavirus (FRECV). Systemic coronavirus disease in ferrets closely resembles feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in domestic cats, which can manifest with anterior uveitis, chorioretinitis, optic neuritis, and retinal detachment. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of ocular lesions in a ferret with systemic coronavirus disease, suggesting that ferrets presented with similar ocular lesions should also be evaluated for evidence of coronavirus infection.","Lindemann, Dana M.; Eshar, David; Schumacher, Loni L.; Almes, Kelli M.; Rankin, Amy J.",Vet Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25918975/; https://doi.org/10.1111/vop.12274,470
625617,National drug shortages worsen during COVID-19 crisis: Proposal for a comprehensive model to monitor and address critical drug shortages,2020-07-27,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Myasthenia gravis (MG) patients could be a vulnerable group in the pandemic era of coronavirus 2019 (COVID‐19) mainly due to respiratory muscle weakness, older age and long‐term immunosuppressive treatment. We aimed to define factors predicting the severity of COVID‐19 in MG patients and risk of MG exacerbation during COVID‐19. METHODS: We evaluated clinical features and outcomes after COVID‐19 in 93 MG patients. RESULTS: Thirty‐five patients (38%) had severe pneumonia and we recorded 10 deaths (11%) due to COVID‐19. Higher forced vital capacity (FVC) values tested before COVID‐19 were shown to be protective against severe infection (95% CI 0.934–0.98) as well as good control of MG measured by the quantified myasthenia gravis score (95% CI 1.047–1.232). Long‐term chronic corticosteroid treatment worsened the course of COVID‐19 in MG patients (95% CI 1.784–111.43) and this impact was positively associated with dosage (p = 0.005). Treatment using azathioprine (95% CI 0.448–2.935), mycophenolate mofetil (95% CI 0.91–12.515) and ciclosporin (95% CI 0.029–2.212) did not influence the course of COVID‐19. MG patients treated with rituximab had a high risk of death caused by COVID‐19 (95% CI 3.216–383.971). Exacerbation of MG during infection was relatively rare (15%) and was not caused by remdesivir, convalescent plasma or favipiravir (95% CI 0.885–10.87). CONCLUSIONS: As the most important predictors of severe COVID‐19 in MG patients we identified unsatisfied condition of MG with lower FVC, previous long‐term corticosteroid treatment especially in higher doses, older age, the presence of cancer, and recent rituximab treatment.","Jakubíková, Michala; Týblová, Michaela; Tesař, Adam; Horáková, Magda; Vlažná, Daniela; Ryšánková, Irena; Nováková, Iveta; Dolečková, Kristýna; Dušek, Pavel; Piťha, Jiří; Voháňka, Stanislav; Bednařík, Josef",Eur J Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34080271/,470

In this study, we used an integrative computational approach to examine molecular mechanisms underlying functional effects of the D614G mutation by exploring atomistic modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins as allosteric regulatory machines. We combined atomistic simulations, deep mutational scanning and sensitivity mapping together with the network-based community analysis to examine structures of the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in different functional states. Conformational dynamics and analysis of collective motions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins demonstrated that the D614 position anchors a key regulatory cluster that dictates functional transitions between open and closed states. Using mutational scanning and sensitivity analysis of the spike residues, we identified the evolution of stability hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 spike structures of the mutant trimers. The results offer support to the reduced shedding mechanism of as a driver of the increased infectivity triggered by the D614G mutation. By employing the landscape-based network community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, our results revealed that the D614G mutation can promote the increased number of stable communities in the open form by enhancing the stability of the inter-domain interactions. This study provides atomistic view of the interactions and stability hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, offering a useful insight into the molecular mechanisms of the D614G mutation that can exert its functional effects through allosterically induced changes on stability of the residue interaction networks.","Verkhivker, Gennady M.; Agajanian, Steve; Oztas, Deniz Yazar; Gupta, Grace",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.18.444742,470

However, T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells suppress B cell activation. Since changes in the number and functions of Tfr cells lead to dysregulated GC reaction and autoantibody response, targeting Tfr cells may benefit the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Differentiation of Tfr cells is a multistage and multifactorial process with various positive and negative regulators. Therefore, understanding the signals regulating Tfr cell generation is crucial for the development of targeted therapies. In this review, we discuss recent studies that have elucidated the roles of Tfr cells in autoimmune diseases and investigated the modulators of Tfr cell differentiation.

Here, we describe four different institutions’ approaches to addressing the impact of curricular transformation on clerkships using an implementation science lens. Specifically, we explore four different approaches to managing the ‘bulge’ as classes overlap in clerkships Curriculum leaders at four medical schools report on managing the bulge of core clinical placements resulting from reducing the duration of the foundational sciences curriculum and calendar shifts for the respective clerkship curriculum. These changes, which occurred between 2014 and 2018, led to more students being enrolled in core clinical rotations at the same time than occurred previously. Schools provided respective metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of their bulge management technique. These data typically included number of students affected in each phase of their curricular transformation, performance on standardized examinations, and student and faculty feedback. Not all data were available from all schools, as some schools are still working through their ‘bulge’ or are affected by COVID-19. There is much to be learned about managing curricular transformations.

The plague of 1630 in Milan and the COVID-19 pandemia,2020-05-11,"Background: Ultrasonography’s usefulness in endometrial cancer (EC) diagnosis consists in its roles in staging and prediction of metastasis. Ultrasound-measured tumor-free distance from the tumor to the uterine serosa (uTFD) is a promising marker for these diagnostic and prognostic variables. The aim of the study was to determine the usefulness of this biomarker in locoregional staging, and thus in the prediction of lymph node metastasis (LNM). Methods: We conducted a single-institutional, prospective study on 116 consecutive patients with EC who underwent 2D transvaginal ultrasound examination. The uTFD marker was compared with the depth of ultrasound-measured myometrial invasion (uMI). Univariable and multivariable logit models were evaluated to assess the predictive power of the uTFD and uMI in regard to LNM. The reference standard was a final histopathology result. Survival was assessed by the Kaplan–Meier method. Results: LNM was found in 17% of the patients (20/116). In the univariable analysis, uMI and uTFD were significant predictors of LNM. The accuracy was 70.7%, and the NPV was 92.68% (OR 4.746, 95% CI 1.710–13.174) for uMI (p = 0.002), and they were 63.8% and 89.02% (OR 0.842, 95% CI 0.736–0.963), respectively, for uTFD (p = 0.01). The cutoff value for uTFD in the prediction of LNM was 5.2 mm. The association between absence of LNM and biomarker values of uMI < 1/2 and uTFD ≥ 5.2 mm was greater than that between the presence of metastases and uMI > 1/2 and uTFD values <5.2 mm. In the multivariable analysis, the accuracy of the uMI–uTFD model was 74%, and its NPV was 90.24% (p = non-significant). Neither uMI nor uTFD were surrogates for overall and recurrence-free survivals in endometrial cancer. Conclusions: Both uMI and uTFD, either alone or in combination, were valuable tools for gaining additional preoperative information on expected lymph node status. Negative lymph nodes status was better described by ultrasound biomarkers than a positive status. It was easier to use the uTFD rather than the uMI measurement as a biomarker of EC invasion, and the former still maintained a similar predictive value for lymph node metastases to the latter at diagnosis.","Liro, Marcin; Śniadecki, Marcin; Wycinka, Ewa; Wojtylak, Szymon; Brzeziński, Michał; Stańczak, Agata; Wydra, Dariusz",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34441406/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11081472,470

We divide these emergencies into four types—natural disasters, accidents, public health events, and social security events—and conduct a simulation using three examples from each group. The results show that government control of public opinion is both cheaper and more effective when it occurs at the initial stages of an incident.

628923,Historical and methodological highlights of quarantine measures: from ancient plague epidemics to current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic,2020-05-11,"BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA. Despite the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation promoting the early antiviral treatment of high-risk patients, treatment coverage remains low. METHODS: To evaluate the population-level impact of increasing antiviral treatment timeliness and coverage among high-risk patients in the USA, we developed an influenza transmission model that incorporates data on infectious viral load, social contact, and healthcare-seeking behavior. We modeled the reduction in transmissibility in treated individuals based on their reduced daily viral load. The reduction in hospitalizations following treatment was based on estimates from clinical trials. We calibrated the model to weekly influenza data from Texas, California, Connecticut, and Virginia between 2014 and 2019. We considered in the baseline scenario that 2.7–4.8% are treated within 48 h of symptom onset while an additional 7.3–12.8% are treated after 48 h of symptom onset. We evaluated the impact of improving the timeliness and uptake of antiviral treatment on influenza cases and hospitalizations. RESULTS: Model projections suggest that treating high-risk individuals as early as 48 h after symptom onset while maintaining the current treatment coverage level would avert 2.9–4.5% of all symptomatic cases and 5.5–7.1% of all hospitalizations. Geographic variability in the effectiveness of earlier treatment arises primarily from variabilities in vaccination coverage and population demographics. Regardless of these variabilities, we found that when 20% of the high-risk individuals were treated within 48 h, the reduction in hospitalizations doubled. We found that treatment of the elderly population (> 65 years old) had the highest impact on reducing hospitalizations, whereas treating high-risk individuals aged 5–19 years old had the highest impact on reducing transmission. Furthermore, the population-level benefit per treated individual is enhanced under conditions of high vaccination coverage and a low attack rate during an influenza season. CONCLUSIONS: Increased timeliness and coverage of antiviral treatment among high-risk patients have the potential to substantially reduce the burden of seasonal influenza in the USA, regardless of influenza vaccination coverage and the severity of the influenza season.

However, due to the recent emergence of this virus in the human population it is not yet known how long these Ab responses will be maintained or whether they will provide protection from re-infection. Using sequential serum samples collected up to 94 days post onset of symptoms (POS) from 65 RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, we show seroconversion in >95% of cases and neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses when sampled beyond 8 days POS. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the nAb response is dependent upon the disease severity, but this does not affect the kinetics of the nAb response. Declining nAb titres were observed during the follow up period. Whilst some individuals with high peak ID50 (>10,000) maintained titres >1,000 at >60 days POS, some with lower peak ID50 had titres approaching baseline within the follow up period. A similar decline in nAb titres was also observed in a cohort of seropositive healthcare workers from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals. We suggest that this transient nAb response is a feature shared by both a SARS-CoV-2 infection that causes low disease severity and the circulating seasonal coronaviruses that are associated with common colds. This study has important implications when considering widespread serological testing, Ab protection against re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the durability of vaccine protection.","Seow, J.; Graham, C.; Merrick, B.; Acors, S.; Steel, K.

To fill this gap, we estimate the adjustments required to extrapolate estimates of the IFR from high- to lower-income regions. Accounting for differences in the distribution of age, sex, and relevant comorbidities yields substantial differences in the predicted IFR across 21 world regions, ranging from 0.11% in Western Sub-Saharan Africa to 0.95% for High Income Asia Pacific. However, these predictions must be treated as lower bounds, as they are grounded in fatality rates from countries with advanced health systems. In order to adjust for health system capacity, we incorporate regional differences in the relative odds of infection fatality from childhood influenza. This adjustment greatly diminishes, but does not entirely erase, the demography-based advantage predicted in the lowest income settings, with regional estimates of the predicted COVID-19 IFR ranging from 0.43% in Western Sub-Saharan Africa to 1.74% for Eastern Europe.","Ghisolfi, S.; Ingvild Almas, I.; Sandefur, J.; von Carnap, T.; Heitner, J.; Bold, T.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.05.20123489; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.05.20123489v1?rss=1,470

The aim of this study was to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of a self-guided web-based intervention of the Parenting Forest program. The intervention program consists of six self-applied sequential modules that use strategies from contextual therapies for providing a parenting style open to experience, mindful and committed to its actions. A pilot controlled open trial was conducted. Eligible parents (n = 12) enrolled in the web-based intervention completed baseline (T1) and post-intervention (T2) assessment instruments. Parental psychological flexibility, avoidance, emotional regulation, parental stress, satisfaction with life, children’s psychological adjustment and client satisfaction were measured to assess the effects of the intervention. Mood, coping, and value-related actions were assessed as measures of progress. The results showed positive effects on the parents’ psychological flexibility and emotion regulation. Parents’ mood and coping skills improved throughout the intervention program. These results provide preliminary evidence of the web-based Parenting Forest’s efficacy, although further research is needed to assess its effectiveness for prevention and in clinical populations.","Flujas-Contreras, Juan M.; García-Palacios, Azucena; Gómez, Inmaculada",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33805835/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18062958,470

This study aimed to investigate the incidence of VTE among mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 pneumonia, compared to patients with respiratory failure related to other causes. Prospective study that enrolled critically ill adults with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia between June 2, 2020 and August 11, 2020. Critically ill adults with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia who required mechanical ventilation within 24 h after hospital admission were followed until death or hospital discharge. Sequential ultrasonography screening of the lower extremities and catheter insertion sites, as well as testing for plasma biochemical markers, were performed at the intensive care unit admission, day 3, day 7, and day 14. The primary outcome was a composite of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and thrombosis at the central catheter insertion sites. We enrolled 70 patients, including 57 patients with COVID-19 and 13 patients without COVID-19, and all patients completed follow-up. The incidence of the primary outcome was higher among patients with COVID-19 than among patients with respiratory failure related to other etiologies (36.8% vs. 0%, p = 0.023). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that VTE was independently associated with a COVID-19 diagnosis (odds ratio: 6.28, 95% confidence interval: 1.19–68.07) and D-dimer concentration (1-ng/mL increase, odds ratio: 1.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.05–1.30).

The objective of this study is to investigate the factors associated with the professional identity of nursing undergraduates in the epidemic of COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design with convenience sampling was used. A total of 3875 nursing undergraduates were recruited from seven universities across China from March to April 2020. A general information questionnaire was used to collect students’ information, and the Professional Identity Questionnaire for Nurse Students was used to survey their professional identity during the early and later stages of the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. RESULTS: The score of professional identity in the later stage (59.49 ± 12.41) was higher than that in the early stage (56.96 ± 12.61). The stepwise regression indicated that several factors were associated with professional identity, including gender, residential area, major (rehabilitation nursing), impact of the epidemic on intention to work after graduation, reasons for choosing nursing major and students’ scores of professional identity in early stage. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing educators can utilize the positive impact of responding to public health emergencies to increase the professional identity of students. Meanwhile, educators should give those students with lower professional identity more targeted education to cultivate their professional identity after the occurrence of public health emergencies.","TANG, Man; SUN, Yumie; ZHANG, Kaili; LUO, Ruzhen; LIU, Yanhui; SUN, Hongyu; ZHOU, Fang",Int J Nurs Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352013221000946?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352013221000946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34567827/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnss.2021.09.005,470

(Letter #2),2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND: The role of vitamin D in the susceptibility and severity of various viral diseases has been well documented. Recently, some reports highlighted the possible importance of vitamin D in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although India receives adequate sunlight throughout the year, the majority of Indians are deficient in vitamin D levels. In the present study, we hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency would be associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate and mortality in the Indian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality data were obtained from the Government of India's official website (accessed on 16(th) August 2020). Various literature databases like PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to find the mean of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in different states and union territories of India, Pearson correlation was carried out to investigate the possible link between mean 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality per million of the population. RESULTS: An inverse correlation was observed between the mean level of 25(OH)D and SARS-CoV-2 infection rate (r= -0.43, p= 0.02) and mortality rate (r= -0.42, p= 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The present observational study revealed an association of vitamin D with SARS-CoV-2 infection and related mortality.

We aimed to assess the risk of COVID‐19 infection, COVID‐19‐associated hospitalization, and mortality among Israeli patients with psoriasis treated by TNFi relative to other systemic agents. A population‐based cohort study was conducted to compare psoriasis patients treated by TNFi (n = 1943), with those treated by methotrexate (n = 1929), ustekinumab (n = 348), and acitretin (n = 1892) regarding COVID‐19 outcomes. Risk of investigated outcomes was assessed using uni‐ and multi‐variate Cox regression analyses. The incidence rate of COVID‐19, COVID‐19‐associated hospitalization, and mortality in the TNFi group was 35.8 (95% CI, 26.1‐47.9), 0.8 (95% CI, 0.0‐4.2), and 0.0 per 1000 person‐years, respectively. Exposure to TNFi was associated with a comparable risk of COVID‐19 infection [adjusted hazard ration (HR) for TNFi vs methotrexate: 1.07 (95% CI, 0.67‐1.71); TNFi vs ustekinumab: 1.07 (95% CI, 0.48‐2.40); TNFi vs acitretin: 0.98 (95% CI, 0.61‐1.57)]. TNFi was associated with a decreased risk of COVID‐19‐associated hospitalization relative to methotrexate (adjusted HR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01‐0.82) and ustekinumab (adjusted HR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.00‐0.64), but not to acitretin (adjusted HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.16‐6.16). No significant difference in COVID‐19‐associated mortality was found between the four different groups. TNFi was associated with a decreased risk of admissions due to COVID‐19.

Therefore, the objective of this review is to summarize emerging evidence on the vertical transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and CENTRAL. Likewise, a search for preprint publications was conducted using MedRxiv and Research Square. Studies that addressed vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (concept) among pregnant women infected by Covid-19 (population) in any setting (community, hospital, or home) in any country or context were considered for inclusion. Any types of studies or reports published between December 2019 and September 2020 addressing the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnant women and their newborn babies were included. Studies were screened for eligibility against the inclusion criteria for the review by two reviewers. RESULTS: We identified 51 studies reporting 336 newborns screened for COVID-19. From the 336 newborns screened for COVID-19, only 15 (4.4%) were positive for throat swab RT-PCR. All neonates with positive throat swab RT-PCR were delivered by cesarean section. Among neonates with throat swab SARS-CoV-2 positive only five (33.3%) had concomitant placenta, amniotic fluid, and cord blood samples tested, of which only one amniotic fluid sample is positive for RT PCR. Five neonates had elevated IgG and IgM but without intrauterine tissue tested. Four neonates had chest imaging suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Currently there is not enough evidence on vertical virologic transmission of COVID-19 infection during the third trimester of pregnancy. Additionally, there is no evidence to support cesarean delivery, abstaining from breast feeding nor mother and infant separation. Further research involving an adequate sample size of breast milk, placenta, amniotic fluid, and cord blood to ascertain the possibility of vertical transmission and breast milk transfer is needed.","Tolu, Lemi Belay; Ezeh, Alex; Feyissa, Garumma Tolu",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886645/,470

Proper treatment, however, depends on correct identification of the pathogen involved as antibiotics provide little or no benefit with viral infections. Here we describe a rapid and sensitive genotyping assay and microarray for URI identification using standard amplification and hybridization techniques, with electrochemical detection (ECD) on a semiconductor-based oligonucleotide microarray. The assay was developed to detect four bacterial pathogens (Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) and 9 viral pathogens (adenovirus 4, coronavirus OC43, 229E and HK, influenza A and B, parainfluinza types 1, 2, and 3 and respiratory syncytial virus. This new platform forms the basis for a fully automated diagnostics system that is very flexible and can be customized to suit different or additional pathogens. Multiple probes on a flexible platform allow one to test probes empirically and then select highly reactive probes for further iterative evaluation. Because ECD uses an enzymatic reaction to create electrical signals that can be read directly from the array, there is no need for image analysis or for expensive and delicate optical scanning equipment. We show assay sensitivity and specificity that are excellent for a multiplexed format.","Lodes, Michael J.; Suciu, Dominic; Wilmoth, Jodi L.; Ross, Marty; Munro, Sandra; Dix, Kim; Bernards, Karen; Stöver, Axel G.; Quintana, Miguel; Iihoshi, Naomi; Lyon, Wanda J.; Danley, David L.; McShea, Andrew",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17895966/,470

This paper models the interaction of pollution and disease preventive actions, either pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions, on transmission of infectious diseases in a neoclassical growth framework. There are two externalities – households do not take into account how their actions affect disease transmission, and productive activity results in pollution which increases the likelihood of infections. The disease dynamics are modeled to be of SIS type. We study the difference in health and economic outcomes between the decentralized economy, where households do not internalize externalities, and socially optimal outcomes, and characterize the taxes and subsidies that decentralize the latter. Thus, we examine the question whether there are sufficient incentives to reduce pollution, at both private and public levels, once its effects on disease transmission is considered. In competitive outcomes, pollution increases with increased productivity. The socially efficient outcome has higher pollution than a competitive outcome, despite increase in abatement, as the effect of higher productivity and larger labor supply dominates. The results question the hopes of a Green Recovery.","Goenka, Aditya; Liu, Lin; Nguyen, Manh-Hung",Econ Model,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2021.105639; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999321002285?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34539023/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264999321002285,470

Consultations most probably have significant implications for hospitalization outcomes. PURPOSE: To determine key aspects of consultations provided by various departments to formulate an optimal policy. METHODS: This study comprised two methods: first, a questionnaire was completed in 2019 by 127 physicians interns, residents and senior doctors) from the medical and surgical departments (64 from the surgical wards, 43 from the medical wards and 22 from the emergency room and General ICU) regarding the availability, timeliness and documentation rate of the consultations they received from different disciplines. The investigators rounded through the various departments that were included in the study and they accosted a sample of interns, residents and attending physicians, who were then asked to fill the questionnaire. Overall compliance of filling the questionnaire was 95%. Residents accounted for 72% of the filled questionnaires, seniors and interns accounted for 15 and 13% respectively. Second, a convenience sample of 300 electronic records of hospitalized patients (135 from the surgical wards, 129 from the Medical wards and 36 from the emergency room and General ICU) of actually carried out consultations was reviewed for validated indicators of quality for both the consultation request and response. We used a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from poor (1) to superb (5), to grade the measured parameters. RESULTS: The availability, timeliness and documentation rate for medical consultations were 4 ± 0.9, 4.1 ± 0.9 and 4.3 ± 0.9 respectively, as compared with surgical consultations 3.2 ± 1.1, 3.4 ± 1.2 and 3.6 ± 1.2 respectively (P < 0.001). The mean time (in hours) from the consultation request till documentation (of the requested consultation) by consultants in the medical and surgical departments was 3.9 ± 5.9 and 10.0 ± 15.6, respectively (P < 0.001). The quality of requests of consultations from the medical and surgical departments was 3.4 ± 1.1 and 2.8 ± 1.2, respectively (P < 0.001). Two different models of consultations are employed: while each medical department adopts several departments for medical consultations, each day’s on-call surgeon provides all the hospital’s surgical consultations. CONCLUSION: We detected significant differences in key aspects of consultations provided by the departments. The medical model of consultations, in which each medical department adopts several other wards to which it provides consulting services upon request, should probably be adopted as a major policy decision by hospitals directors to enhance inter-departmental consultations.

The virus is primarily associated with flu-like symptoms but can also lead to severe pathologies and death. We here present an ordinary differential equation model of the intrahost immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, fitted to experimental data gleaned from rhesus macaques. The model is calibrated to data from a nonlethal infection, but the model can replicate behavior from various lethal scenarios as well. We evaluate the sensitivity of the model to biologically relevant parameters governing the strength and efficacy of the immune response. We also simulate the effect of both anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs on the host immune response and demonstrate the ability of the model to lessen the severity of a formerly lethal infection with the addition of the appropriately calibrated drug. Our model emphasizes the importance of tight control of the innate immune response for host survival and viral clearance.

636619,COVID-19 emergencies around the globe: China’s experience in controlling COVID-19 and lessons learned,2020-12-15,"Background: The novel 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) poses a great threat to global public health and the economy. The earlier detection of COVID-19 is the key to its treatment and mitigating the transmission of the virus. Given that Machine Learning (ML) could be potentially useful in COVID-19 identification, we compared 7 decision tree (DT) algorithms to select the best clinical diagnostic model. Methods: A hospital-based retrospective dataset was used to train the selected DT algorithms. The performance of DT models was measured using performance criteria, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and precision-recall curves (PRC). Finally, the best decision model was obtained based on comparing the mentioned performance criteria. Results: Based on the Gini Index (GI) scoring model, 13 diagnostic criteria, including the lung lesion existence (GI= 0217), fever (GI= 0.205), history of contact with suspected people (GI= 0.188), O(2) saturation rate in the blood (GI= 0.181), rhinorrhea (GI= 0.177), dyspnea (GI = 0.177), cough (GI = 0.159), history of taking the immunosuppressive drug (GI= 0.145), history of respiratory failure (ARDS) (GI= 0.141), lung lesion situation (GI= 0.133) and appearance (GI= 0.126), diarrhea (GI= 0.112), and nausea and vomiting (GI = 0.092) have been obtained as the most important criteria in diagnosing COVID-19. The results indicated that the J-48, with the accuracy= 0.85, F-Score= 0.85, ROC= 0.926, and PRC= 0.93, had the best performance for diagnosing COVID-19.

637643,Gender-Specific Changes in Life Satisfaction After the COVID-19–Related Lockdown in Dutch Adolescents: A Longitudinal Study,2021-08-24,"Background: The novel coronavirus SARS-Cov2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as an entry point to the cell. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a risk factor for the novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) with poor outcomes. We hypothesized that the rate of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) use is associated with the rate of Covid-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Methods: We conducted a geospatial study using publicly available county-level data. The Medicare ACEIs and ARBs prescription rate was exposure. The Covid-19 confirmed case and death rates were outcomes. Spatial autoregression models were adjusted for the percentage of Black residents, children, residents with at least some college degree, median household income, air quality index, CVD hospitalization rate in Medicare beneficiaries, and CVD death rate in a total county population. Results: The ACEI use had no effect on Covid-19 confirmed case rate. An average ACEIs use (compared to no-use) was associated with a higher Covid-19 death rate by 1.1 (95%CI 0.4-1.8)%. If the use of ACEIs increases by 0.5% for all counties, the Covid-19 death rate will drop by 0.4% to 0.7(95%CI 0.3-1.1)%; P<0.0001. An average ARBs use (compared to no-use) was associated with a higher Covid-19 confirmed case rate (by 4.2; 95%CI 4.1-4.3 %) and death rate (by 1.1; 95%CI 0.7-1.5 %). Each percent increase in ARBs use was associated with an increase in confirmed case rate by 0.2(0.03-0.4)% and death rate by 0.14(0.08-0.21)%. Conclusions: ARBs, but not ACEIs use rate, is associated with Covid-19 confirmed case rate.","Johnson, K.; Khayyat-Kholghi, M.; Johnson, B.; Tereshchenko, L.

Here, we use mathematical modelling to study the dynamics of COVID-19 in Bahia, a state in northeastern Brazil, considering the influences of asymptomatic/non-detected cases, hospitalizations, and mortality. The impacts of policies on the transmission rate were also examined. Our results underscore the difficulties in maintaining a fully operational health infrastructure amidst the pandemic. Lowering the transmission rate is paramount to this objective, but current local efforts, leading to a 36% decrease, remain insufficient to prevent systemic collapse at peak demand, which could be accomplished using periodic interventions. Non-detected cases contribute to a ∽55% increase in R(0).

638279,KNOWLEDGE AND BEHAVIORS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN MALAWI,2020-06-18,"BACKGROUND: Mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a mortality of 24–53%, in part due to distal mucopurulent secretions interfering with ventilation. Dornase alfa is recombinant human DNase 1 and digests DNA in mucoid sputum. Nebulized dornase alfa is FDA-approved for cystic fibrosis treatment. DNA from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contributes to the viscosity of mucopurulent secretions. NETs are found in the serum of patients with severe COVID-19, and targeting NETs reduces mortality in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, dornase alfa may be beneficial to patients with severe COVID-19—acting as a mucolytic and targeting NETs. However, delivery of nebulized drugs can aerosolize SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, increasing the infection risk for staff. Here, we report a single center case series where dornase alfa was administered through an in-line nebulizer system to minimize risk of virus aerosolization. METHODS: Demographic, clinical data, and outcomes were collected from the electronic medical records of five mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19—including three requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO)—treated with nebulized in-line endotracheal dornase alfa co-administered with albuterol (used to increase delivery to the alveoli), between March 31 and April 24, 2020. Data on tolerability and responses, including longitudinal values capturing respiratory function and inflammatory status, were analyzed. RESULTS: Following nebulized in-line administration of dornase alfa with albuterol, the fraction of inspired oxygen requirements was reduced for all five patients. All patients remain alive and two patients have been discharged from the intensive care unit. No drug associated toxicities were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented in this case series suggest that dornase alfa will be well-tolerated by critically ill patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials are required to formally test the dosing, safety, and efficacy of dornase alfa in COVID-19, and two have recently been registered (NCT04359654 and NCT04355364). With this case series, we hope to contribute to the development of management approaches for critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Weber, Andrew G.; Chau, Alice S.; Egeblad, Mikala; Barnes, Betsy J.; Janowitz, Tobias",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.20087734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511514/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.13.20087734v1?rss=1,470
638283,COVID-19: Pros and cons of different caring techniques of elderly patients,2021-03-31,"The wave of COVID-19 is a big threat to the human population. Presently, the world is going through different phases of lock down in order to stop this wave of pandemic; India being no exception. We have also started the lock down on 23rd March 2020. In this current situation, apart from social distancing only a vaccine can be the proper solution to serve the population of human being. Thus it is important for all the nations to perform the genome-wide analysis in order to identify the genetic variation in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) so that proper vaccine can be designed. This fast motivated us to analyze publicly available 566 Indian complete or near complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes to find the mutation points as substitution, deletion and insertion. In this regard, we have performed the multiple sequence alignment in presence of reference sequence from NCBI. After the alignment, a consensus sequence is build to analyze each genome in order to identify the mutation points. As a consequence, we have found 933 substitutions, 2449 deletions and 2 insertions, in total 3384 unique mutation points, in 566 genomes across 29.9 K bp. Further, it has been classified into three groups as 100 clusters of mutations (mostly deletions), 1609 point mutations as substitution, deletion and insertion and 64 SNPs. These outcomes are visualized using BioCircos and bar plots as well as plotting entropy value of each genomic location. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis has also been performed to see the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus in India. It also shows the wide variation in tree which indeed vivid in genomic analysis. Finally, these SNPs can be the useful target for virus classification, designing and defining the effective dose of vaccine for the heterogeneous population.","Saha, Indrajit; Ghosh, Nimisha; Maity, Debasree; Sharma, Nikhil; Sarkar, Jnanendra Prasad; Mitra, Kaushik",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32659347/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134820302884; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104457; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820302884?v=s5,470
638317,"Health anxiety, cyberchondria, and coping in the current COVID-19 pandemic: Which factors are related to coronavirus anxiety?",2020-05-20,"OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous ultrasound-guided creation of an arteriovenous fistula (pAVF) for hemodialysis access is a relatively novel procedure with promising technical success and patency rates. The vascular surgery departments of two collaborating Swiss hospitals had decided to introduce the technique to their services. A surgeon experienced in the technique (AM) was supposed to come to Switzerland and proctor the first four procedures. Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and travel restrictions, this was not possible and we decided to perform the first four pAVF procedures tele-proctored via a video conference system. We present the setup and our experience with tele-proctoring. METHODS: The setup relied on an all-in-one live video production device, video encoder, video streamer and video recorder (Pearl-2, Epiphan), which made it possible to simultaneously transmit the live image from the ultrasound device (GE Logiq S8, linear probe 9L-D) and a live image from a video camera (JVC Camcorder G/-HM440E, Japan), both connected via HDMI (Figure). The live stream was shared with the proctor in France and the device support team in the US, using an encrypted Swiss video client (www.vitimway.ch). The setup was tested with all parties three days in advance. RESULTS: All 4 procedures started with a verbal briefing and a live ultrasound scan. All steps of the procedures were taken under the proctor’s instruction and supervision. The proctor gave on average 21 instructions per procedure. An average 4 were device-related but these became less frequent as we proceeded. The operators consulted the proctor on average 5 times per procedure. The average duration of the procedure was 34 min. The pAVF creation was successful in all 4 patients, with an average fistula flow measured at the end of the procedure of 600 ml/min. CONCLUSION: Our experience showed us that pAVF creation, which is a procedure performed entirely under sonographic guidance lends itself particularly well to tele-proctoring. The simultaneous transmission of the live sonographic image and the live image of the operators' hands allowed the proctor to supervise and correct the key steps of the procedures. The simplicity of the set-up and the quality of proctor-operator interaction was such a positive experience that we can well envisage a much wider use of tele-proctoring in the future.","Isaak, A; Mallios, A; Gürke, L; Wolff, T",Br J Surg,https://doi.org/10.1093/bjs/znab202.072,470
638408,Speculation vs. evidence in the association between e-cigarette use and COVID-19: A response to Soule et al,2021-08-11,"OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the nature and extent of research on rehabilitation care provision to COVID‐19 (COVID) patients. Specifically, we aimed to: (1) Describe the impact of COVID on patients and associated rehabilitation needs; (2) Outline the adaptations and preparations required to enable the provision of COVID rehabilitation; (3) Describe the types of rehabilitation services and treatments provided to COVID patients; and (4) Identify barriers and facilitators to delivering COVID rehabilitation. LITERATURE SURVEY: We searched Medline, PsychINFO, Embase, and CINAHL on June 26(th), 2020 using key words such as “rehabilitation”, “physical medicine”, “allied health professionals” and variations of “COVID”. The search was updated on October 13(th), 2020. We included articles published in English and that focused on some aspect of COVID rehabilitation for adults. We excluded articles focused on pediatric populations and those not focused (or minimally focused) on rehabilitation for COVID patients. METHODOLOGY: Data were charted based on article type (i.e. primary data, secondary data, guidelines). Key information extracted included: (i) COVID sequelae; (ii) rehabilitation adaptations; (iii) structure, function and content of rehabilitation services/programs; (iv) facilitators and/or barriers to providing COVID rehabilitation; and (v) recommendations for COVID rehabilitation programming. Data were synthesized narratively. SYNTHESIS: In total, 129 articles were included in the review that reported primary data (n=33), secondary data (n=82), and clinical practice/patient self‐management guidelines (n=13). Evidence begins to suggest that rehabilitation is necessary and valuable for addressing COVID‐related declines in health, function, and well‐being. Most articles recommended that an individualized rehabilitation program be provided across the continuum of care by an interdisciplinary team of professionals and that the nature and extent of rehabilitation be informed by the care setting and COVID severity. Most issues that challenged COVID rehabilitation delivery were directly addressed by the facilitators and adaptations identified. CONCLUSIONS: Future recommendations include a greater emphasis on the psychosocial aspects of COVID rehabilitation, inclusion of families in rehabilitation planning, and the use of qualitative approaches to complement clinical data.

We conducted an updated meta-analysis to assess the effect of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with ARDS. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to January 2021 via Ovid to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of patients with ARDS. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included the number of ventilator-free days at day 28, oxygenation improvement (PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratios), and adverse events. RESULTS: Nine studies with 1371 participants were analyzed. The pooled analysis revealed that glucocorticoid use was associated with reduced mortality [relative risk (RR), 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74–0.93; P < 0.01; I(2) = 37], and the statistical power was confirmed by trial sequential analysis. Glucocorticoids might also significantly increase the number of ventilator-free days at day 28 (mean deviation 3.66 days, 95% CI 2.64–4.68; P < 0.01) and improve oxygenation (standardized mean difference 4.17; 95% CI 2.32–6.02; P < 0.01). In addition, glucocorticoid use was not associated with increased risks of new infection (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.70–1.01; P = 0.07) and hyperglycemia (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.99–1.23; P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: The use of glucocorticoids might result in reduced mortality in patients with ARDS. Glucocorticoids might be recommended as an adjunct to standard care for ARDS; however, the optimal dose and duration of steroid therapy remains unknown and further studies are needed.

Les patients infectés présentent principalement les symptômes suivants : symptômes respiratoires, fièvre, rhinorrhée. Des épisodes de diarrhées, d’anosmie et d’agueusie ont pu être observés à plus faible fréquence. Récemment, une étude italienne rapportait que 20 % des patients hospitalisés pour COVID-19 présentaient une atteinte cutanée. L’objectif est de démontrer l’incidence des manifestations cutanées en France chez les patients atteints de COVID-19 et le type de réaction. Matériel et méthodes Étude observationnelle prospective réalisée entre le 15 mars et le 2 avril 2020 chez des patients dont le diagnostic de COVID-19 était confirmé par PCR nasopharyngée. Résultats Cent trois patients ont été inclus dans cette étude : 71 femmes et 32 hommes avec une moyenne d’âge de 47 ans (20-88 ans). Parmi ces patients, 76 étaient traités en ambulatoire, 23 en hospitalisation conventionnelle et 4 étaient admis en réanimation. Aucun ne décédait au cours de l’étude. Seulement 5 patients (4,9 %) présentaient des manifestations cutanées. Deux éruptions érythémateuses maculopapuleuses et 2 urticaires, principalement localisées sur le visage et le haut du corps étaient observées, ainsi qu’une réactivation d’herpès oral chez un patient en réanimation. Discussion En France, au début de la pandémie, seuls les patients ayant des symptômes respiratoires graves étaient dépistés. Il est donc difficile de déterminer une véritable incidence de l’infection et donc l’incidence des manifestations cutanées. C’est pourquoi l’incidence observée est minime par rapport à l’étude de Recalcati S en Italie. Depuis avril 2020, plusieurs études, dont une réalisée par la SFD, ont pu montrer qu’il existe surtout des exanthèmes maculopapuleux, des urticaires et des livédos chez des patients ayant une infection à SARS-Cov-2 confirmée ou suspectée. Finalement, l’incidence des éruptions cutanées semble faible, dans une revue de la littérature (Paulo Ricardo Criado et al.) réalisée début juin, on ne retrouve pas plus de 600 cas rapportés de manifestations cutanées sur plus 4 millions de patients atteints de la COVID-19. Ce faible nombre peut aussi être expliqué par une sous notification des cas de manifestations cutanées devant la gravité moindre. De plus, plusieurs cas d’engelures, inhabituellement fréquentes en cette saison, ont été rapportés par des dermatologues ou généralistes. Cette forme survient plutôt chez les jeunes et sans aucun signe infectieux associé dans la majorité des cas contrairement aux éruptions cutanées non spécifiques. Cependant, plusieurs patients atteints d’engelures ont été testés par PCR et le test était majoritairement négatif. Le recours aux tests sérologiques pourrait permettre d’établir un lien ou non, surtout s’il s’agit d’une manifestation post infectieuse.","Hedou, M.; Masson Regnault, M.; Hainaut, E.",Annales de Dermatologie et de Vénéréologie,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0151963820306360; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0151963820306360,470

Such apps keep track of proximity contacts and warn contacts of persons who tested positive for an infection. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we analyzed potential barriers to the large-scale adoption of the official contact tracing app that was introduced in Germany on June 16, 2020. METHODS: Survey data were collected from 3276 adults during the week the app was introduced using an offline-recruited, probability-based online panel of the general adult population in Germany. RESULTS: We estimate that 81% of the population aged 18 to 77 years possess the devices and ability to install the official app and that 35% are also willing to install and use it. Potential spreaders show high access to devices required to install the app (92%) and high ability to install the app (91%) but low willingness (31%) to correctly adopt the app, whereas for vulnerable groups, the main barrier is access (62%). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a pessimistic view on the effectiveness of app-based contact tracing to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. We recommend targeting information campaigns at groups with a high potential to spread the virus but who are unwilling to install and correctly use the app, in particular men and those aged between 30 and 59 years. In addition, vulnerable groups, in particular older individuals and those in lower-income households, may be provided with equipment and support to overcome their barriers to app adoption.","Blom, Annelies G; Wenz, Alexander; Cornesse, Carina; Rettig, Tobias; Fikel, Marina; Friedel, Sabine; Möhring, Katja; Naumann, Elias; Reifenscheid, Maximiliane; Krieger, Ulrich",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/23362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577466/,470

Additionally, telemedicine has pulled trainees into a new virtual education environment that finds them oftentimes physically separated from their preceptors. Medical educators are challenged with figuring out how to integrate learners into virtual workflows while teaching and providing patient-centered virtual care. In this viewpoint, we review principles of patient-centered care in the in-person setting, explore the concept of patient-centered virtual care, and advocate for the development and implementation of patient-centered telemedicine competencies.

Amidst ongoing global vaccination efforts, rare cases of severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have received significant attention. Although the exact nature of these reactions may be heterogeneous, various approaches exist to engage with patients, communities, public health departments, primary care providers, and other clinicians in a multidisciplinary approach to advance population health. While it is optimal for patients to receive COVID-19 vaccination as outlined in emergency use authorizations, second dose deferral of mRNA vaccines may be a consideration within a shared decision-making paradigm of care in select circumstances characterized by high durable first vaccine dose protection and significant elevations of vaccine anaphylaxis risk. Still, the durability of protection afforded by a single dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is uncertain, and alternative approaches to complete vaccination, including precautionary use of a COVID-19 viral vector vaccine, also remain patient preference sensitive options.

The bacterium infects and replicates in macrophages, leading to a Th2-biased immune response. Previous studies have shown that T. whipplei harbors complex surface glycoproteins with evidence of sialylation. However, the exact contribution of these glycoproteins for infection and survival remains obscure. To address this, we characterized the bacterial glycoprofile and evaluated the involvement of human β-galactoside-binding lectins, Galectin-1 (Gal-1) and Galectin-3 (Gal-3) which are highly expressed by macrophages as receptors for bacterial glycans. Tropheryma whipplei glycoproteins harbor different sugars including glucose, mannose, fucose, β-galactose and sialic acid. Mass spectrometry identification revealed that these glycoproteins were membrane- and virulence-associated glycoproteins. Most of these glycoproteins are highly sialylated and N-glycosylated while some of them are rich in poly-N-acetyllactosamine (Poly-LAcNAc) and bind Gal-1 and Gal-3. In vitro, T. whipplei modulates the expression and cellular distribution of Gal-1 and Gal-3. Although both galectins promote T. whipplei infection by enhancing bacterial cell entry, only Gal-3 is required for optimal bacterial uptake. Finally, we found that serum levels of Gal-1 and Gal-3 were altered in patients with T. whipplei infections as compared to healthy individuals, suggesting that galectins are also involved in vivo. Among T. whipplei membrane-associated proteins, poly-LacNAc rich-glycoproteins promote infection through interaction with galectins. T. whipplei modulates the expression of Gal-1 and Gal-3 both in vitro and in vivo. Drugs interfering with galectin–glycan interactions may provide new avenues for the treatment and diagnosis of T. whipplei infections.","Ayona, Diyoly; Zarza, Sandra Madariaga; Landemarre, Ludovic; Roubinet, Benoît; Decloquement, Philippe; Raoult, Didier; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Desnues, Benoit",Gut microbes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33573443/; https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2021.1884515,470

Here we describe a new phylogenetic analytical method to study the sources and dissemination paths of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections in Taiwan Methods A phylogenetic analytical tool for combining nucleotide sequences from 6 variable regions of a SARS-CoV genome was developed by use of 20 published SARS-CoV sequences; and this method was validated by use of 80 published SARS-CoV sequences. Subsequently, this new tool was applied to provide a better understanding of the entire complement of Taiwanese SARS-CoV isolates, including 20 previously published and 19 identified in this study. The epidemiological data were integrated with the results from the phylogenetic tree and from the nucleotide-signature pattern Results The topologies of phylogenetic trees generated by the new and the conventional strategies were similar, with the former having better robustness than the latter, especially in comparison with the maximum-likelihood trees: the new strategy revealed that during 2003 there were 5 waves of epidemic SARS-CoV infection, which belonged to 3 phylogenetic clusters in Taiwan Conclusions The new strategy is more efficient than its conventional counterparts.

We conducted an ecological analysis at regional scale of long-term exposure to air-borne particle matter and spread of Covid-19 cases during the first wave of epidemics. Global air pollution and climate data were calculated from satellite earth observation data assimilated into numerical models at 10 km resolution. Main outcome was defined as the cumulative number of cases of Covid-19 in the 14 days following the date when > 10 cumulative cases were reported. Negative binomial mixed effect models were applied to estimate the associations between the outcome and long-term exposure to air pollution at the regional level (PM(10), PM(2.5)), after adjusting for relevant regional and country level covariates and spatial correlation. In total we collected 237,749 Covid-19 cases from 730 regions, 63 countries and 5 continents at May 30, 2020. A 10 μg/m(3) increase of pollution level was associated with 8.1% (95% CI 5.4%, 10.5%) and 11.5% (95% CI 7.8%, 14.9%) increases in the number of cases in a 14 days window, for PM(2.5) and PM(10) respectively.

643961,Telemedicine During the COVID-19 in Italy: A Missed Opportunity?,2020-08-01,"The ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global public health emergency. SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen of COVID-19, is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae. For RNA viruses, virus-encoded RNA helicases have long been recognized to play pivotal roles during viral life cycles by facilitating the correct folding and replication of viral RNAs. Here, our studies show that SARS-CoV-2-encoded nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13) possesses the nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (NTPase) and RNA helicase activities that can hydrolyze all types of NTPs and unwind RNA helices dependently of the presence of NTP, and further characterize the biochemical characteristics of these two enzymatic activities associated with SARS-CoV-2 nsp13. Moreover, we found that some bismuth salts could effectively inhibit both the NTPase and RNA helicase activities of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, our findings demonstrate the NTPase and helicase activities of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13, which may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 replication and serve as a target for antivirals.

644384,Caring for Persons Living With Dementia During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Advocacy Perspectives From India,2020-10-27,"Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been international concern about the emergence of virus variants with mutations that increase transmissibility, enhance escape from the human immune response, or otherwise alter biologically important phenotypes. In late 2020, several “variants of concern” emerged globally, including the UK variant (B.1.1.7), South Africa variant (B.1.351), Brazil variants (P.1 and P.2), and two related California “variants of interest” (B.1.429 and B.1.427). These variants are believed to have enhanced transmissibility. For the South Africa and Brazil variants, there is evidence that mutations in spike protein permit it to escape from some vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Based on our extensive genome sequencing program involving 20,453 COVID-19 patient samples collected from March 2020 to February 2021, we report identification of all six of these SARS-CoV-2 variants among Houston Methodist Hospital patients residing in the greater metropolitan area. Although these variants are currently at relatively low frequency (aggregate of 1.1%) in the population, they are geographically widespread. Houston is the first city in the United States in which active circulation of all six current variants of concern has been documented by genome sequencing. As vaccine deployment accelerates, increased genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understanding the presence, frequency, and medical impact of consequential variants and their patterns and trajectory of dissemination.","Long, S.

Many governments around the world have responded by implementing lockdown measures of various degrees of intensity. To be effective, these measures must rely on citizens’ cooperation. In the present study, we drew samples from the United States (N = 597), Italy (N = 606), and South Korea (N = 693) and examined predictors of compliance with social distancing and intentions to report the infection to both authorities and acquaintances. Data were collected between April 6th and 8th 2020. We investigated the role of cultural orientations of horizontal and vertical individualism and collectivism, self-conscious emotions of shame and guilt related to the infection and trust in the government’s action. Across all countries, vertical collectivism (VC) predicted stronger shame, whereas horizontal collectivism predicted stronger trust in the government. Only in the United States, VC was associated with stronger trust. Stronger feelings of shame predicted lower compliance and intentions to report the infection to both authorities and acquaintances. In contrast, guilt was associated with stronger intentions to report the infection to the authorities. Finally, trust was associated with stronger compliance and intentions to report the infection to the authorities. Unlike Italy and South Korea, the association between trust on compliance was not statistically significant in the United States, implications of the findings, and directions for future research are discussed.","Travaglino, Giovanni A.; Moon, Chanki",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796038/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.565845,470
645108,Surgical Site Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance After Cesarean Section Delivery in Rural Rwanda,2021-08-06,"IMPORTANCE: Nursing home residents account for approximately 40% of deaths from SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 incidence, hospitalization, and mortality among nursing home residents in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted in long-stay residents aged 65 years or older with fee-for-service Medicare residing in 15 038 US nursing homes from April 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020. Data were analyzed from November 22, 2020, to February 10, 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was risk of diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 (per International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-10-CM] codes) by September 30 and hospitalization or death within 30 days after diagnosis. Three-level (resident, facility, and county) logistic regression models and competing risk models conditioned on nursing home facility were used to determine association of patient characteristics with outcomes. RESULTS: Among 482 323 long-stay residents included, the mean (SD) age was 82.7 (9.2) years, with 326 861 (67.8%) women, and 383 838 residents (79.6%) identifying as White. Among 137 119 residents (28.4%) diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 during follow up, 29 204 residents (21.3%) were hospitalized, and 26 384 residents (19.2%) died within 30 days. Nursing homes explained 37.2% of the variation in risk of infection, while county explained 23.4%. Risk of infection increased with increasing body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) (eg, BMI>45 vs BMI 18.5-25: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.15-1.24) but varied little by other resident characteristics. Risk of hospitalization after SARS-CoV-2 increased with increasing BMI (eg, BMI>45 vs BMI 18.5-25: aHR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.28-1.52); male sex (aHR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.29-1.35); Black (aHR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.24-1.32), Hispanic (aHR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15-1.26), or Asian (aHR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.36-1.57) race/ethnicity; impaired functional status (eg, severely impaired vs not impaired: aHR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.10-1.22); and increasing comorbidities, such as renal disease (aHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.18-1.24) and diabetes (aHR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.13-1.18). Risk of mortality increased with age (eg, age >90 years vs 65-70 years: aHR, 2.55; 95% CI, 2.44-2.67), impaired cognition (eg, severely impaired vs not impaired: aHR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.71-1.86), and functional impairment (eg, severely impaired vs not impaired: aHR, 1.94; 1.83-2.05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that among long-stay nursing home residents, risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with county and facility of residence, while risk of hospitalization and death after SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with facility and individual resident characteristics. For many resident characteristics, there were substantial differences in risk of hospitalization vs mortality. This may represent resident preferences, triaging decisions, or inadequate recognition of risk of death.","Mehta, Hemalkumar B.; Li, Shuang; Goodwin, James S.",JAMA Netw Open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.6315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787905/,470

Trade in wildlife likely played a role in the origin of COVID-19, and viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in bats and pangolins, both traded widely. To investigate the possible role of pangolins as a source of potential zoonoses, we collected throat and rectal swabs from 334 Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) confiscated in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah between August 2009 and March 2019. Total nucleic acid was extracted for viral molecular screening using conventional PCR protocols used to routinely identify known and novel viruses in extensive prior sampling (>50,000 mammals). No sample yielded a positive PCR result for any of the targeted viral families – Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae. In light of recent reports of coronaviruses including a SARS-CoV-2 related virus in Sunda pangolins in China, the lack of any coronavirus detection in our ‘upstream’ market chain samples suggests that these detections in ‘downstream’ animals more plausibly reflect exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network. While confirmatory serologic studies are needed, it is likely that Sunda pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses. Our findings further support the importance of ending the trade in wildlife globally.","Lee, Jimmy; Hughes, Tom; Lee, Mei-Ho; Field, Hume; Rovie-Ryan, Jeffrine Japning; Sitam, Frankie Thomas; Sipangkui, Symphorosa; Nathan, Senthilvel K.S.S.; Ramirez, Diana; Kumar, Subbiah Vijay; Lasimbang, Helen; Epstein, Jonathan H.; Daszak, Peter",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.19.158717,470

This paper provides statistical analysis of the air quality data monitored by the Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi (EAD) during the first 10 months of 2020, comparing the different stages of the preventive measures. Ground monitoring data is compared with satellite images and mobility indicators. The study shows a drastic decrease during lockdown in the concentration of the gaseous pollutants analysed (NO(2), SO(2), CO, and C(6)H(6)) that aligns with the results reported in other international cities and metropolitan areas. However, particulate matter (PM(10) and PM(2.5)) averaged concentrations followed a markedly different trend from the gaseous pollutants, indicating a larger influence from natural events (sand and dust storms) and other anthropogenic sources. The ozone (O(3)) levels increased during the lockdown, showing the complexity of O(3) formation. The end of lockdown led to an increase of the mobility and the air pollution; however, air pollutant concentrations remained in lower levels than during the same period of 2019. The results in this study show the large impact of human activities on the quality of air and present an opportunity for policymakers and decision-makers to design stimulus packages to overcome the economic slow-down, with strategies to accelerate the transition to resilient, low-emission economies and societies more connected to the nature that protect human health and the environment.

(A. chinensis) is widely used in East Asia as a diuretic and stomachic drug, for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, digestive disorders, night blindness, and influenza as it contains a variety of sesquiterpenoids and other components of medicinal importance. AIM OF THE REVIEW: A systematic summary on the botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, and quality control of AR was presented to explore the future therapeutic potential and scientific potential of this plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the literature was performed by consulting scientific databases including Google Scholar, Web of Science, Baidu Scholar, Springer, PubMed, ScienceDirect, CNKI, etc. Plant taxonomy was confirmed to the database “The Plant List”. RESULTS: Over 200 chemical compounds have been isolated from AR, notably sesquiterpenoids and alkynes. Various pharmacological activities have been demonstrated, especially improving gastrointestinal function and thus allowed to assert most of the traditional uses of AR. CONCLUSIONS: The researches on AR are extensive, but gaps still remain. The molecular mechanism, structure-activity relationship, potential synergistic and antagonistic effects of these components need to be further elucidated.

Any effort to increase public awareness and comprehension of SARS-Cov-2 in Bangladesh will then offer preference to males, who did not practice self-quarantine and are less worried about the propagation of this kind of virus.","Abir, Tanvir; Kalimullah, Nazmul Ahsan; Osuagwu, Uchechukwu Levi; Yazdani, Dewan Muhammad Nur -A.; Mamun, Abdullah Al; Husain, Taha; Basak, Palash; Permarupan, P.

To investigate the distribution of HBoV1 and determine the effect of meteorological conditions, hospitalized pediatric patients were studied in a subtropical region of China. METHODS: Samples from 11,399 hospitalized pediatric patients (≤14 years old), with ARI were tested for HBoV1 and other common respiratory pathogens using real-time PCR, between July 2009 and June 2016. In addition, local meteorological data were collected. RESULTS: Of the 11,399 patients tested, 5606 (49.2%) were positive for at least one respiratory pathogen. Two hundred forty-eight of 11,399 (2.2%) were positive for HBoV1 infection. Co-infection was common in HBoV1-positive patients (45.2%, 112/248). A significant difference in the prevalence of HBoV1 was found in patients in different age groups (p < 0.001), and the peak prevalence was found in patients aged 7–12 months (4.7%, 56/1203). Two HBoV1 prevalence peaks were found in summer (between June and September) and winter (between November and December). The prevalence of HBoV1 was significantly positively correlated with mean temperature and negatively correlated with mean relative humidity, and the mean temperature in the preceding month had better explanatory power than the current monthly temperature. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a better understanding of the characteristics of HBoV1 infection in children in subtropical regions. Data from this study provide useful information for the future control and prevention of HBoV1 infections.","Liu, Wen-Kuan; Liu, Qian; Chen, De-Hui; Tan, Wei-Ping; Cai, Yong; Qiu, Shu-Yan; Xu, Duo; Li, Chi; Li, Xiao; Lin, Zheng-Shi; Zhou, Rong",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3225-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30012099/,470
648677,The Canadian response to the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-09-28,"Critically ill COVID-19 patients are characterized by a severely dysregulated cytokine profile and elevated neutrophil counts, which are thought to contribute to disease severity. However, to date it remains unclear how neutrophils contribute to pathophysiology during COVID-19. Here, we assessed the impact of the dysregulated cytokine profile on the tightly regulated cell death program of neutrophils. We show that in a subpopulation of neutrophils, canonical apoptosis was skewed towards rapidly occurring necroptosis. This phenotype was characterized by abrogated caspase-8 activity and increased RIPK1 levels, favoring execution of necroptosis via the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL axis, as further confirmed in COVID-19 biopsies. Moreover, reduction of sFas-L levels in COVID-19 patients and hence decreased signaling to Fas directly increased RIPK1 levels and correlated with disease severity. Our results suggest an important role for Fas signaling in the regulation of cell death program ambiguity via the ripoptosome in neutrophils during COVID-19 and a potential therapeutic target to curb inflammation and thus influence disease severity and outcome.","Schweizer, Tiziano A.; Shambat, Srikanth Mairpady; Vulin, Clément; Hoeller, Sylvia; Acevedo, Claudio; Huemer, Markus; Gomez-Mejia, Alejandro; Chang, Chun-Chi; Baum, Jeruscha; Hertegonne, Sanne; Hitz, Eva; Hofmaenner, Daniel A.; Buehler, Philipp K.; Moch, Holger; Schuepbach, Reto A.; Brugger, Silvio D.; Zinkernagel, Annelies S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.19.436166,470

The occurrence of ARDS in COVID 19 patients is thought to occur secondary to an exaggerated immunologic response. In this meta-analysis, we aim to comprehensively study the various levels of immunological parameters in patients with COVID 19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, EuropePMC, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Database, and medRxiv with the search terms, “COVID-19” and “Interleukin”. The outcome of interest was prognosis in COVID 19 patients. RESULTS: We performed meta analysis of 16 studies. Higher counts of CD4 and CD8 with Lower Levels of TNF-a, IL2R, IL6, IL8 were observed on patients with good prognosis compared to patients with poor prognosis; −0.57 (pg/mL) (−1.10, −0.04, p = 0.04), (I(2) 91%, p < 0.001); was −579.84 (U/mL) (−930.11, −229.57, p < 0.001), (I(2) 96%, p < 0.001); −1.49 (pg/mL) (−1.97, −1.01, p < 0.001), (I(2) 94%, p < 0.001); −0.80 (pg/mL) (−1.21, −0.40, p < 0.001), (I2 79%, p < 0.001); −2.51 (pg/mL) (−3.64, −1.38, p < 0.00001), (I(2) 98%, p < 0.001) respectively.

The duration of immunity provided by an inactivated FeLV vaccine, Versifel FeLV, when administered to cats of the target age was determined. Kittens received two vaccinations when aged 7 to 9 weeks old, and were subsequently challenged up to 36 months later with the FeLV-A Glasgow isolate. RESULTS: In all studies, all of the younger aged control kittens showed persistent FeLV p27 antigenaemia confirming that the challenge virus was severe and efficacious. In contrast, the control cats did not show the required level of persistent antigenaemia, with a maximum of 45% cats affected in the middle duration study and only 10% in the longer study. However, apart from one animal in the short duration study, all of the cats vaccinated with Versifel FeLV were negative for persistent antigenaemia and can be considered treatment successes. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we have shown that although age-related resistance to infection with a virulent FeLV challenge is evident from as early as 10 months of age, vaccination with Versifel FeLV may aid in the protection of cats from FeLV related disease up to three years after primary vaccination as kittens.","Wilson, Stephen; Greenslade, Juliet; Saunders, Gillian; Holcroft, Catherine; Bruce, Lynn; Scobey, Andy; Childers, Tedd; Sture, Gordon; Thompson, James",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22839692/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-125,470

METHODS: “on the field” experience of the Authors is reported, followed by a narrative review of the literature, mainly on the topic of health-personnel redeployment during an emergency. RESULTS: a brief chronological discussion of the progressive reorganization of the hospital, in relation to the progress of the epidemic in the area, is reported, with specific reference to the experience of orthopedic and other branches specialist surgeons, that was characterized by a high degree of uncertainty about what to do, worsened by organizational difficulties due to the incessant arrival of patients and subsequent overcrowding. Observations relating to the critical aspects that have emerged and the various solutions proposed or implemented, if they have been identified, as well as the problems still open, are then made and compared to current literature. CONCLUSIONS: the most significant aspect that we have tried to outline is the organizational difficulty, due to the rapid and unpredictable change in the situation: greater efficiency and flexibility, seen as the ability to overcome bureaucratic, logistical, regulatory or budgetary obstacles that prevent the rapid changes made necessary by the epidemic, could perhaps help to face better any subsequent pandemic wave, like the fierce one ongoing at the present moment (www.actabiomedica.it)","Ferrara, Fabrizio; Galmarini, Valter; Tosco, Piermario; Molinari, Giampaolo; Capelli, Roberto Maria",Acta Biomed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33988153/; https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v92i2.10921,470

Primary routes of transmission of the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), are through respiratory droplets and close person-to-person contact. While information about other potential modes of transmission are relatively sparse, evidence supporting the possibility of a fecally-mediated mode of transmission has been accumulating. Here, current knowledge on the potential for fecal transmission is briefly reviewed and the possible implications are discussed from a public health perspective.","Amirian, E.

Using the lens of communication ecology, this study examines the online communication of national public health agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, Sweden, and the United States. Based on content analysis of Twitter data (n = 856) and agency press releases (n = 95), this article investigates two main questions: (1) How, and to what extent, did national public health agencies coordinate their online communication with other agencies and organizations? (2) How was online communication from the agencies diversified in terms of targeting specific organizations and social groups? Our findings indicate that public health agencies relied heavily on internal scientific expertise and predominately coordinated their communication efforts with national government agencies. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that agencies in each country differed in how they diversify information; however, all agencies provided tailored information to at least some organizations and social groups. Across the three countries, information tailored for several vulnerable groups (e.g., pregnant women, people with disabilities, immigrants, and homeless populations) was largely absent, which may contribute to negative consequences for these groups.","Tagliacozzo, Serena; Albrecht, Frederike; Ganapati, N.

Using this system, we evaluated compounds with known and unknown efficacy against related arenaviruses, with the aim of identifying LUJV-specific and potential new pan-arenavirus antivirals. We identified six compounds demonstrating robust anti-LUJV activity, including several compounds with previously reported activity against other arenaviruses.

651258,Cognitive Biases Affecting the Maintenance of COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-12,"Like many other RNA viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) produces polyproteins containing several non‐structural proteins, which are then processed by the viral proteases. These proteases often exist within the polyproteins, and are excised by their own proteolytic activity (‘autoprocessing’). It is important to investigate the autoprocessing mechanism of these proteases from the point of view of anti‐SARS‐CoV drug design. In this paper, we describe a new method for investigating the autoprocessing mechanism of the main protease (M (pro)), which is also called the 3C‐like protease (3CL (pro)). Using our method, we measured the activities, under the same conditions, of the mature form and pro‐forms with the N‐terminal pro‐sequence, the C‐terminal pro‐sequence or both pro‐sequences, toward the pro‐form with both N‐ and C‐terminal pro‐sequences. The data indicate that the pro‐forms of the enzyme have proteolytic activity, and are stimulated by the same proteolytic activity. The stimulation occurs in two steps, with approximately eightfold stimulation by N‐terminal cleavage, approximately fourfold stimulation by C‐terminal cleavage, and 23‐fold stimulation by the cleavage of both termini, compared to the pro‐form with both the N‐ and C‐terminal pro‐sequences. Such cleavage mainly occurs in a trans manner; i.e. the pro‐form dimer cleaves the monomeric form. The stimulation by N‐terminal pro‐sequence removal is due to the cis (intra‐dimer and inter‐protomer) effect of formation of the new N‐terminus, whereas that by C‐terminal cleavage is due to removal of its trans (inter‐dimer) inhibitory effect. A numerical simulation of the maturation pathway is presented.","Muramatsu, Tomonari; Kim, Yong‐Tae; Nishii, Wataru; Terada, Takaho; Shirouzu, Mikako; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki",FEBS J,https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.12222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23452147/,470

The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with workplace cognitive failure in a sample of U.S. nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire was administered in May 2020 to Michigan nurses statewide via three nursing organizations (n = 695 respondents). Path analysis was conducted to test the parallel effects of frequency of contact with COVID patients and personal protective equipment (PPE) supply on workplace cognitive failure scores. Mediation effects of stress, sleep quality, secondary trauma, and work-related exhaustion were examined for each exposure. Results revealed significant indirect effects of all mediators except sleep quality of contact with COVID patients (cumulative indirect effect = 1.30, z = 6.33, p < 0.001) and PPE (cumulative indirect effect = −2.10, z = −5.22, p < 0.001) on cognitive failure. However, 58% of the PPE effect was direct.

Compared to the nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, several studies have established saliva as a more amenable specimen type for early detection of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the limitations and high demand for COVID-19 testing, we employed MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry in the analysis of 60 gargle samples from human donors and compared the resultant spectra against COVID-19 status. Several standards, including isolated human serum immunoglobulins, and controls, such as pre-COVID-19 saliva and heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, were simultaneously analyzed to provide a relative view of the saliva and viral proteome as they would appear in this workflow. Five potential biomarker peaks were established that demonstrated high concordance with COVID-19 positive individuals. Overall, the agreement of these results with RT-qPCR testing on NP swabs was ≥90% for the studied cohort, which consisted of young and largely asymptomatic student athletes. From a clinical standpoint, the results from this pilot study suggest that MALDI-ToF could be used to develop a relatively rapid and inexpensive COVID-19 assay.","Chivte, Prajkta; LaCasse, Zane; Seethi, Venkata Devesh R.; Bharti, Pratool; Bland, Joshua; Kadkol, Shrihari S.; Gaillard, Elizabeth R.",Journal of mass spectrometry and advances in the clinical lab,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34518823/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667145X2100016X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667145X2100016X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsacl.2021.09.001,470

The city of New Orleans, Louisiana experienced one of the earliest and fastest accelerating outbreaks, coinciding with the annual Mardi Gras festival, which went ahead without precautions. To gain insight into the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. and how large, crowded events may have accelerated early transmission, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Louisiana. We show that SARS-CoV-2 in Louisiana initially had limited sequence diversity compared to other U.S. states, and that one successful introduction of SARS-CoV-2 led to almost all of the early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Louisiana. By analyzing mobility and genomic data, we show that SARS-CoV-2 was already present in New Orleans before Mardi Gras and that the festival dramatically accelerated transmission, eventually leading to secondary localized COVID-19 epidemics throughout the Southern U.S.. Our study provides an understanding of how superspreading during large-scale events played a key role during the early outbreak in the U.S. and can greatly accelerate COVID-19 epidemics on a local and regional scale.","Zeller, Mark; Gangavarapu, Karthik; Anderson, Catelyn; Smither, Allison R.; Vanchiere, John A.; Rose, Rebecca; Snyder, Daniel J.; Dudas, Gytis; Watts, Alexander; Matteson, Nathaniel L.; Robles-Sikisaka, Refugio; Marshall, Maximilian; Feehan, Amy K.; Sabino-Santos, Gilberto; Bell-Kareem, Antoinette R.; Hughes, Laura D.; Alkuzweny, Manar; Snarski, Patricia; Garcia-Diaz, Julia; Scott, Rona S.; Melnik, Lilia I.; Klitting, Raphaälle; McGraw, Michelle; Belda-Ferre, Pedro; DeHoff, Peter; Sathe, Shashank; Marotz, Clarisse; Grubaugh, Nathan; Nolan, David J.; Drouin, Arnaud C.; Genemaras, Kaylynn J.; Chao, Karissa; Topol, Sarah; Spencer, Emily; Nicholson, Laura; Aigner, Stefan; Yeo, Gene W.; Farnaes, Lauge; Hobbs, Charlotte A.; Laurent, Louise C.; Knight, Rob; Hodcroft, Emma B.; Khan, Kamran; Fusco, Dahlene N.; Cooper, Vaughn S.; Lemey, Phillipe; Gardner, Lauren; Lamers, Susanna L.; Kamil, Jeremy P.; Garry, Robert F.; Suchard, Marc A.; Andersen, Kristian G.",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251235v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33564781/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.05.21251235,470

Our objective is to describe the morbidity and mortality of elderly patients admitted for a hip fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile, with a minimum 90-day follow-up. Also, to elucidate predictors for mortality and to compare mortality results with the pre-pandemic era. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Multicentric retrospective review of patients admitted for a fragility hip fracture in 3 hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, and during the same time in 2019. All clinical information and images were recorded, and patients were followed for a minimum of 90-days. Morbidity and mortality were the primary outcomes. Uni/multivariable models were performed to elucidate predictors for mortality utilizing the Weibull’s regression. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-one cases were included. From the 2020 cohort (162 patients), 24 (15%) had a concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fourteen patients (58%) tested positive after admission. The COVID-19(+) group had a higher risk of in-hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality (p < 0.001). They also had a prolonged hospital stay and presented with more complications and readmissions (p < 0.05). Only COVID-19(+) status and older age were independent predictors for mortality with a HR = 6.5 (p = < 0.001) and 1.09 (p = 0.001), respectively. The 2020 cohort had twice the risk of mortality with a HR = 2.04 (p = 0.002) compared to the 2019 cohort. However, comparing only the COVID-19 (-) patients, there was no difference in mortality risk, with a HR = 1.30 (p = 0.343). DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected healthcare systems and elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hip fracture patients with a concomitant SARS-CoV-2 virus infection were associated with increased morbidity and mortality throughout the first 3 months. COVID-19 status and older age were significant predictors for mortality. Efforts should be directed into nosocomial infection reduction and prompt surgical management.

653074,Nursing Moral Distress and Intent to Leave Employment During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"This study examined the difficulties of running online physical education classes in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and used the findings to develop an efficient operation plan to address these difficulties. Six middle and high school physical education teachers participated; three were experts in online physical education and active in the Korea Council School Physical Education Promotion, and three were recommended teachers making efforts to improve the online classes offered by the Korea Ministry of Education. A qualitative case study method employing phenomenological procedures to collect and analyze the data was used. The difficulties of operating middle and high school online physical education classes for the first time included (1) the monotony of the classes within their limited environmental conditions and limited educational content that did not adequately convey the value of physical education, (2) trial-and-error methods applied nationwide, resulting from a lack of expertise in operating online physical education classes, and (3) very limited evaluation guidelines proposed by the Korea Ministry of Education, which made systematic evaluation with online methods impossible. To address the identified problems and facilitate the efficient operation of online physical education classes, changes in strategic learning methods are needed to understand online physical education characteristics and thereby better communicate the value of physical education. It is also necessary to cultivate teaching expertise through sharing online physical education classes, where collaboration among physical education teachers is central. In addition, evaluation processes should be less formal to encourage active student participation.","Jeong, Hyun-Chul; So, Wi-Young",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17197279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33028002/,470

METHODS: Descriptive cohort study using electronic general practice records of patients in England, who attended an influenza vaccination aged ≥65 years and were diagnosed with AF between 2008 and 2018. Patients were stratified by 10-year age group and year of diagnosis. Proportion anticoagulated, type of anticoagulation (direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) or warfarin) initiated at diagnosis and persistence with anticoagulation over time are reported. RESULTS: 42 290 patients (49% female), aged 65–74 (n=11 722), 75–84 (n=19 055) and 85+ (n=11 513) years at AF diagnosis are included. Prescription of anticoagulation at diagnosis increased over the time period from 55% to 86% in people aged 65–74 years, from 54% to 86% in people aged 75–84 years and from 27% to 75% in people aged 85 years and over. By 2018, 92% of patients with newly diagnosed AF were started on a DOAC. Survivor function for 5-year persistence in patients prescribed DOAC was 0.80 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.82) and for warfarin 0.71 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.72). Survivor function for any anticoagulation at 5 years was 0.79 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.81), 0.73 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.75) and 0.58 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.64) for people aged 65–74, 75–84 and 85+ years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of anticoagulation in AF in those aged ≥65 years have increased from 2008 to 2018, over which time period there has been a shift from initiating anticoagulation with warfarin to DOAC. Persistence with anticoagulation is higher in people on DOACs than on warfarin and in people aged <85 years.","Lund, Jenny; Saunders, Catherine L; Edwards, Duncan; Mant, Jonathan",Open Heart,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34344724/; https://doi.org/10.1136/openhrt-2021-001737,470

The global COVID-19 outbreak started in Guangdong Province, China’s southernmost province. The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by the sheer number of infected people, many of whom need intensive care before succumbing to the disease. The epidemic is being handled by a combination of disease control by public health interventions and compassionate treatment for those who have been impacted. There is no clear anti-COVID-19 medication available at this time. However, the need to find medications that can turn the tide has led to the development of a number of investigational drugs as potential candidates for improving outcomes, especially in the severely and critically ill. Although many of these adjunctive medications are still being studied in clinical trials, professional organizations have attempted to define the circumstances in which their use is deemed off-label or compassionate. It is important to remind readers that new information about COVID-19’s clinical features, treatment options, and outcomes is released on a regular basis. The mainstay of treatment remains optimized supportive care, and the therapeutic effectiveness of the subsequent agents is still being studied.","Abd El Hadi, Soha R; Zien El-Deen, Esmat E; Bahaa, Mostafa M; Sadakah, Abdelfattah A; Yassin, Heba A",Drug Des Devel Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34366663/; https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s320320,470

This study aimed to develop and compare prognosis prediction machine learning models based on invasive laboratory and noninvasive clinical and demographic data from patients’ day of admission. Three Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were developed and compared using invasive, non-invasive, and both groups. The results suggested that non-invasive features could provide mortality predictions that are similar to the invasive and roughly on par with the joint model. Feature inspection results from SVM-RFE and sparsity analysis displayed that, compared with the invasive model, the non-invasive model can provide better performances with a fewer number of features, pointing to the presence of high predictive information contents in several non-invasive features, including SPO(2), age, and cardiovascular disorders. Furthermore, while the invasive model was able to provide better mortality predictions for the imminent future, non-invasive features displayed better performance for more distant expiration intervals. Early mortality prediction using non-invasive models can give us insights as to where and with whom to intervene. Combined with novel technologies, such as wireless wearable devices, these models can create powerful frameworks for various medical assignments and patient triage.","Mahdavi, Mahdi; Choubdar, Hadi; Zabeh, Erfan; Rieder, Michael; Safavi-Naeini, Safieddin; Jobbagy, Zsolt; Ghorbani, Amirata; Abedini, Atefeh; Kiani, Arda; Khanlarzadeh, Vida; Lashgari, Reza; Kamrani, Ehsan",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34214101/,470

In vitro, activation induces virus-cell membrane fusion at the cell surface. However, the roles of TMPRSS2 during coronavirus infection in vivo are unclear. Here, we used animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection to investigate the role of TMPRSS2. Th1-prone C57BL/6 mice and TMPRSS2-knockout (KO) mice were used for SARS-CoV infection, and transgenic mice expressing the human MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 (hDPP4-Tg mice) and TMPRSS2-KO hDPP4-Tg mice were used for MERS-CoV infection. After experimental infection, TMPRSS2-deficient mouse strains showed reduced body weight loss and viral kinetics in the lungs. Lack of TMPRSS2 affected the primary sites of infection and virus spread within the airway, accompanied by less severe immunopathology. However, TMPRSS2-KO mice showed weakened inflammatory chemokine and/or cytokine responses to intranasal stimulation with poly(I·C), a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist. In conclusion, TMPRSS2 plays a crucial role in viral spread within the airway of murine models infected by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and in the resulting immunopathology. IMPORTANCE Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against highly pathogenic coronaviruses and other emerging viruses are desirable to enable a rapid response to pandemic threats. Transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), a protease belonging to the type II transmembrane serine protease family, cleaves the coronavirus spike protein, making it a potential therapeutic target for coronavirus infections. Here, we examined the role of TMPRSS2 using animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. The results suggest that lack of TMPRSS2 in the airways reduces the severity of lung pathology after infection by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Taken together, the results will facilitate development of novel targets for coronavirus therapy.","Iwata-Yoshikawa, Naoko; Okamura, Tadashi; Shimizu, Yukiko; Hasegawa, Hideki; Takeda, Makoto; Nagata, Noriyo",Journal of Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626688/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01815-18; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/6/e01815-18.full.pdf,470
655010,3rd National Conference Academic Medical Centre: Health System Resilience During the Covid-19 Pandemic: Virtual. 22-23 March 2021,2021-08-26,"OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the literature on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing in patients with altered olfactory/gustatory function due to COVID-19 for evidence of viral neuroinvasion. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of Medline and Embase to identify publications that described at least one patient with COVID-19 who had altered olfactory/gustatory function and had CSF testing performed. The search ranged from December 1, 2019 to November 18, 2020. RESULTS: We identified 51 publications that described 70 patients who met inclusion criteria. Of 51 patients who had CSF SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, 3 (6%) patients had positive results and 1 (2%) patient had indeterminate results. Cycle threshold (Ct; the number of amplification cycles required for the target gene to exceed the threshold, which is inversely related to viral load) was not provided for the patients with a positive PCR. The patient with indeterminate results had a Ct of 37 initially, then no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on repeat testing. Of 6 patients who had CSF SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, 3 (50%) were positive. Testing to distinguish intrathecal antibody synthesis from transudation of antibodies to the CSF via breakdown of the blood-brain barrier was performed in 1/3 (33%) patients; this demonstrated antibody transmission to the CSF via transudation. CONCLUSION: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF via PCR or evaluation for intrathecal antibody synthesis appears to be rare in patients with altered olfactory/gustatory function. While pathology studies are needed, our review suggests it is unlikely that these symptoms are related to viral neuroinvasion.","Lewis, Ariane; Frontera, Jennifer; Placantonakis, Dimitris G.; Galetta, Steven; Balcer, Laura; Melmed, Kara R.",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303846721002894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34146842/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2021.106760; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303846721002894?v=s5,470

Methods A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was completed by 348 physicians who met the study inclusion criteria, from 20 out of 36 randomly selected healthcare facilities in Yerevan, Armenia, between Dec 2017 to Sep 2018. The aim of the questionnaire was to identify physicians awareness of and attitudes to HPV-related cervical cancer and the Gardasil vaccine. Responses were analysed using SPSS software (Version 16). Results The responding physicians displayed a respectable level of knowledge and awareness regarding vaccination with regard to some characteristics (e.g. more than 81% knew that HPV infection was commonly asymptomatic, 87% were knew that HPV infection was implicated in most cervical cancers and 87% knew that cervical cancer is the most prevalent cancer amongst women) but low knowledge in others and poor understanding of key issues such as the age at which women were most likely to develop cervical cancer (only 15% answered correctly); whether or not the vaccine should be administered to people who had already been affected (27% answered correctly) and whether sexually active young people should be treated for infection before vaccination (26%). Lack of confidence within the surveyed groups regarding the value of vaccination and, in particular concerns over the reasons for administering it to certain age cohorts, was driven by misconceptions. Conclusions Armenian physicians awareness of vaccine characteristics, the reasons for their inclusion in the national vaccination programme and the characteristics of the diseases they treat can be poor. The study further suggests that drivers of vaccine hesitancy are complex, may not be consistent from vaccine to vaccine, and may vary from generation to generation. The Armenian healthcare sector may need to provide additional training, awareness-raising and educational activities to improve understanding of and trust in vaccination programmes. Further studies are warranted to better understand knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding immunization and vaccination programmes amongst Armenian healthcare workers.","Badalyan, A.

METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected during the period of tightest restrictions between 26 April 2020 and 6 June 2020. Eligible participants included all Russian adults aged 18 years and over. Participants reported their sleep patterns and problems, frequency and duration of walking, moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA, and muscle strengthening activities before COVID-19 and during the past 7 days. Access to an outdoor green space and fitness centres, use of online resources, adherence to self-isolation recommendations and other preventive measures from Ministry of Health were self-reported. RESULTS: The sample included 2432 participants from 62 regions, 83% of who were female. There was a significant decline in the number of days per week participants reported not getting enough sleep (3.21 ± 2.44 to 2.86 ± 2.57; P < 0.001); participants also reported an increase in the number of days per week they had trouble falling asleep (1.70 ± 2.24 to 2.13 ± 2.48; P < 0.001). The proportion of participants who met the WHO Guidelines for PA declined from 68 to 49% (P < 0.001). The proportion who participated in muscle strengthening activities for 2 or more days per week declined from 53 to 45% (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Compared with before COVID-19, PA and sleep hygiene were adversely affected during COVID-19.

Objective: To gain insight into the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs working in elderly care settings. Design: Cross-sectional study among HCWs working in elderly care in the South-East of the Netherlands, testing for SARS-CoV-2, between March 31 and April 17, 2020. Setting: HCWs working in geriatric rehabilitation, somatic and psychogeriatric wards or small-scale living groups and district nursing, with a total of 5245 HCWs within 4 organisations. Participants: 621 HCWs with mild respiratory symptoms. Main Outcomes: Number of HCWs testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swabs, using real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 E-gene, N-gene, and RdRP. HCWs filled out a survey to collect information on symptoms and possible sources of infection. Results: 133/615 (21.6%) HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, ranging from 15.6 to 44.4% per elderly care organisation, and from 0 to 64.3% per separate location of the organizations, respectively. 74.6% of tested HCWs were nursing staff, 1.7% elderly care physicians, 20.3% other HCWs with patient contact and 3.4% HCWs without patient contact. In the univariate analysis, fever, runny or stuffy nose, anosmia, general malaise, myalgia, headache and ocular pain were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity, while gastro-intestinal symptoms and respiratory symptoms, other than runny or stuffy nose were not. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 positivity were contact with patients or colleagues with suspected or proven COVID-19. Whole genome sequencing of 22 samples in 2 facilities strongly suggests spread within facilities. Conclusions and Relevance: We found a high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs in nursing homes and district nursing, supporting the hypothesis of undetected spread within elderly care facilities. Structural testing of elderly care HCWs, including track and trace of contacts, should be performed to control this spread, even when only mild symptoms are present.","Dautzenberg, Mirjam Jeanne Dorine; Eikelenboom-Boskamp, Andrea; Janssen, Jacqueline; Drabbe, Miranda; Jong, Ewoud de; Weesendorp, Eefke; Koopmans, Marion; Voss, Andreas",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.07.20178731; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.07.20178731v1?rss=1,470

Older people with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and in particular hypertension, are at higher risk of hospitalization and death for COVID-19. Whether hypertension medications may increase the risk for death in older COVID 19 inpatients at the highest risk for the disease is currently unknown. Methods: Data from 5,625 COVID-19 inpatients were manually extracted from medical charts from 61 hospitals across Italy. From the initial 5,625 patients, 3,179 were included in the study as they were either discharged or deceased at the time of the data analysis. Primary outcome was inpatient death or recovery. Mixed effects logistic regression models were adjusted for sex, age, and number of comorbidities, with a random effect for site. Results: A large proportion of participating inpatients were ≥65 years old (58%), male (68%), non-smokers (93%) with comorbidities (66%). Each additional comorbidity increased the risk of death by 35% [(adj)OR = 1.35 (1.2, 1.5) p < 0.001]. Use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers or Ca-antagonists was not associated with significantly increased risk of death. There was a marginal negative association between ARB use and death, and a marginal positive association between diuretic use and death. Conclusions: This Italian nationwide observational study of COVID-19 inpatients, the majority of which ≥65 years old, indicates that there is a linear direct relationship between the number of comorbidities and the risk of death. Among CVDs, hypertension and pre-existing cardiomyopathy were significantly associated with risk of death. The use of hypertension medications reported to be safe in younger cohorts, do not contribute significantly to increased COVID-19 related deaths in an older population that suffered one of the highest death tolls worldwide.","Polverino, Francesca; Stern, Debra A.; Ruocco, Gaetano; Balestro, Elisabetta; Bassetti, Matteo; Candelli, Marcello; Cirillo, Bruno; Contoli, Marco; Corsico, Angelo; D'Amico, Filippo; D'Elia, Emilia; Falco, Giuseppe; Gasparini, Stefano; Guerra, Stefano; Harari, Sergio; Kraft, Monica; Mennella, Luigi; Papi, Alberto; Parrella, Roberto; Pelosi, Paolo; Poletti, Venerino; Polverino, Mario; Tana, Claudio; Terribile, Roberta; Woods, Jason C.; Di Marco, Fabiano; Martinez, Fernando D.",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33195473/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2020.585866,470

Presence of some genera, such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Corynebacterium, Cutibacterium (formerly known as Propionibacterium), Lactobacillus, Lactococcus and Bifidobacterium, has been detected by both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. DNA from some gut-associated strict anaerobes has also been repeatedly found and some studies have revealed the presence of cells and/or nucleic acids from viruses, archaea, fungi and protozoa in human milk. Colostrum and milk microbes are transmitted to the infant and, therefore, they are among the first colonizers of the human gut. Still, the significance of human milk microbes in infant gut colonization remains an open question. Clinical studies trying to elucidate the question are confounded by the profound impact of non-microbial human milk components to intestinal microecology. Modifications in the microbiota of human milk may have biological consequences for infant colonization, metabolism, immune and neuroendocrine development, and for mammary health. However, the factors driving differences in the composition of the human milk microbiome remain poorly known.

While the goals are clear—to produce the health workforce that society needs to improve health outcomes—both education and healthcare systems continue to evolve concurrently amidst changes in knowledge, skills, population demographics and social contracts. In observing a significant anniversary of this journal, which sits at the junction of education and healthcare systems, it is appropriate to reflect on how the relationship is evolving. Health professions educators must listen to the voices of regulators, employers, students and patients when adapting to new service delivery models that emerge in response to pressures for change. The recent COVID-19 pandemic is one example of disruptive change, but other factors, such as population pressures and climate change, can also drive innovations that result in lasting change. Emerging technology may act as either a servant of change or a disruptor. There is a pressing need for interdisciplinary research that develops a theory and evidence base to strengthen sustainability of change.","Hays, R.

Using the 2016 American National Election Studies dataset, we build on the literature regarding “egotropic"" and “sociotropic"" economic concerns to distinguish between “micro"" insecurity (perceived insecurity regarding the individual’s own personal economic well-being), and “macro"" insecurity (negative expectations concerning the macro economy). Our results suggest micro insecurity is not significantly correlated with attitudinal differences, but macro-level insecurity is associated with increased levels of political distrust, accompanied by greater authoritarianism. Greater macro-level insecurity is also associated with more negative feelings toward “out-groups"" (e.g. Muslims, the LGBTQ+ community, feminists, immigrants) and was a key predictor in reduced affinity for Hillary Clinton and the rise in support for Donald Trump. Results are robust to controls for political affiliation and aggregate macroeconomic indicators, suggesting that rising levels of income inequality and weakening social safety nets increase political polarization and encourage xenophobia, racism, and homophobia.","Watson, Barry; Law, Stephen; Osberg, Lars",Soc Indic Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-021-02767-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34366546/,470

Due to the limited availability of annotated Coronavirus X-ray and CT images, the detection of COVID-19 remains the biggest challenge in diagnosing this disease. This paper provides a promising solution by proposing a COVID-19 detection system based on deep learning. The proposed deep learning modalities are based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM). Two different datasets are adopted for the simulation of the proposed modalities. The first dataset includes a set of CT images, while the second dataset includes a set of X-ray images. Both of these datasets consist of two categories: COVID-19 and normal. In addition, COVID-19 and pneumonia image categories are classified in order to validate the proposed modalities. The proposed deep learning modalities are tested on both X-ray and CT images as well as a combined dataset that includes both types of images. They achieved an accuracy of 100% and an F1 score of 100% in some cases. The simulation results reveal that the proposed deep learning modalities can be considered and adopted for quick COVID-19 screening.","Sedik, Ahmed; Hammad, Mohamed; Abd El-Samie, Fathi E.; Gupta, Brij B.; Abd El-Latif, Ahmed A.",Neural Comput Appl,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-020-05410-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33487885/,470

The study reflects that there is an enormous disparity in growth rate and total COVID-19 cases. The major outbreak clusters associated with major cities of India. COVID-19 cases are very swiftly amplifying with exponential growth in every four to seven days in main affected states during first phase of lockdown. The result shows the vibrant disproportion in the aspect of, hospital bed ratio, coronavirus case-hospital bed ratio, provision of isolation and ventilators, test ratio, distribution of testing laboratories and accessibility of test centres all over India. The study indicates the sharp inequality in transmission potentiality and resilience capacity of different states.

658551,Development of a fasting blood glucose-based strategy to diagnose women with gestational diabetes mellitus at increased risk of adverse outcomes in a COVID-19 environment,2020-12-03,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) will play a key role in any response to pandemic influenza, and the UK healthcare system's ability to cope during an influenza pandemic will depend, to a large extent, on the number of HCWs who are able and willing to work through the crisis. UK emergency planning will be improved if planners have a better understanding of the reasons UK HCWs may have for their absenteeism, and what might motivate them to work during an influenza pandemic. This paper reports the results of a qualitative study that explored UK HCWs' views (n = 64) about working during an influenza pandemic, in order to identify factors that might influence their willingness and ability to work and to identify potential sources of any perceived duty on HCWs to work. METHODS: A qualitative study, using focus groups (n = 9) and interviews (n = 5). RESULTS: HCWs across a range of roles and grades tended to feel motivated by a sense of obligation to work through an influenza pandemic. A number of significant barriers that may prevent them from doing so were also identified. Perceived barriers to the ability to work included being ill oneself, transport difficulties, and childcare responsibilities. Perceived barriers to the willingness to work included: prioritising the wellbeing of family members; a lack of trust in, and goodwill towards, the NHS; a lack of information about the risks and what is expected of them during the crisis; fear of litigation; and the feeling that employers do not take the needs of staff seriously. Barriers to ability and barriers to willingness, however, are difficult to separate out. CONCLUSION: Although our participants tended to feel a general obligation to work during an influenza pandemic, there are barriers to working, which, if generalisable, may significantly reduce the NHS workforce during a pandemic. The barriers identified are both barriers to willingness and to ability. This suggests that pandemic planning needs to take into account the possibility that staff may be absent for reasons beyond those currently anticipated in UK planning documents. In particular, staff who are physically able to attend work may nonetheless be unwilling to do so. Although there are some barriers that cannot be mitigated by employers (such as illness, transport infrastructure etc.), there are a number of remedial steps that can be taken to lesson the impact of others (providing accommodation, building reciprocity, provision of information and guidance etc). We suggest that barriers to working lie along an ability/willingness continuum, and that absenteeism may be reduced by taking steps to prevent barriers to willingness becoming perceived barriers to ability.","Ives, Jonathan; Greenfield, Sheila; Parry, Jayne M; Draper, Heather; Gratus, Christine; Petts, Judith I; Sorell, Tom; Wilson, Sue",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-9-56; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19216738/,470

Briefly, recreancy is loss of societal trust that results when institutional actors can no longer be counted on to perform their responsibilities. Our study of mental well-being and recreancy focuses on the role of universities and government regulators within the education sector. We surveyed 600 UK students attending 161 different public higher education providers in October 2020 during a time when many UK students were isolated in their residences and engaged in online learning. We assessed student well-being using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (scored 7–35) and found the mean score to be 19.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.6, 20.2]. This level of well-being indicates that a significant proportion of UK students face low levels of mental well-being. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis indicates that high recreancy—measured as a low trust in universities and the government—is associated with low levels of mental well-being across the student sample. While these findings are suggestive, they are also important and we suggest that government and university leaders should not only work to increase food and housing security during the Covid-19 pandemic, but also consider how to combat various sector trends that might intensify recreancy.","Defeyter, Margaret Anne; Stretesky, Paul B.; Long, Michael A.; Furey, Sinéad; Reynolds, Christian; Porteous, Debbie; Dodd, Alyson; Mann, Emily; Kemp, Anna; Fox, James; McAnallen, Andrew; Gonçalves, Lara",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.646916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33981666/,470

659332,A message from the trench: A day in the hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-05-19,"BACKGROUND: Severe COVID-19 pneumonia results from a hyperinflammatory immune response (cytokine storm, CS), characterized by GM-CSF mediated activation and trafficking of myeloid cells, leading to elevation of downstream inflammatory chemokines (MCP-1, IL-8, IP-10), cytokines (IL-6, IL-1), and other markers of systemic inflammation (CRP, D-dimer, ferritin). CS leads to fever, hypotension, coagulopathy, respiratory failure, ARDS, and death. Lenzilumab is a novel Humaneered(®) anti-human GM-CSF monoclonal antibody that directly binds GM-CSF and prevents signaling through its receptor. The LIVE-AIR Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigated the efficacy and safety of lenzilumab to assess the potential for lenzilumab to improve the likelihood of ventilator-free survival (referred to herein as survival without ventilation, SWOV), beyond standard supportive care, in hospitalized subjects with severe COVID-19. METHODS: Subjects with COVID-19 (n=520), ≥18 years, and ≤94% oxygen saturation on room air and/or requiring supplemental oxygen, but not invasive mechanical ventilation, were randomized to receive lenzilumab (600 mg, n=261) or placebo (n=259) via three intravenous infusions administered 8 hours apart. Subjects were followed through Day 28 following treatment. RESULTS: Baseline demographics were comparable between the two treatment groups: male, 64.7%; mean age, 60.5 years; mean BMI, 32.5 kg/m(2); mean CRP, 98.36 mg/L; CRP was <150 mg/L in 77.9% of subjects. The most common comorbidities were obesity (55.1%), diabetes (53.4%), chronic kidney disease (14.0%), and coronary artery disease (13.6%). Subjects received steroids (93.7%), remdesivir (72.4%), or both (69.1%). Lenzilumab improved the likelihood of SWOV by 54% in the mITT population (HR: 1.54; 95%CI: 1.02-2.31, p=0.041) and by 90% in the ITT population (HR: 1.90; 1.02-3.52, nominal p=0.043) compared to placebo. SWOV also relatively improved by 92% in subjects who received both corticosteroids and remdesivir (1.92; 1.20-3.07, nominal p=0.0067); by 2.96-fold in subjects with CRP<150 mg/L and age <85 years (2.96; 1.63–5.37, nominal p=0.0003); and by 88% in subjects hospitalized ≤2 days prior to randomization (1.88; 1.13-3.12, nominal p=0.015). Survival was improved by 2.17-fold in subjects with CRP<150 mg/L and age <85 years (2.17; 1.04-4.54, nominal p=0.040). CONCLUSION: Lenzilumab significantly improved SWOV in hospitalized, hypoxic subjects with COVID-19 pneumonia over and above treatment with remdesivir and/or corticosteroids. Subjects with CRP<150 mg/L and age <85 years demonstrated an improvement in survival and had the greatest benefit from lenzilumab.

Method: A short course, including an introductory lecture and a three component competency based assessment exercise testing student's knowledge and ability in infection control measures was incorporated into the previously established training programme. The assessment exercises included a written test of students’ knowledge of the Infection Control Policy, a unit management exercise and a hand hygiene assessment. The infection control competency was initially incorporated into the final term of the second year in 2004 and is now an established part of the 5‐year dental undergraduate degree programme. Re‐assessments were scheduled (at the start of third year) for students failing to meet the required standard as successful completion of this course was compulsory prior to students being allowed to treat their first patients. Student performance over the last 2 years on this course and during their first year on clinic were analysed to determine potential improvements in student knowledge and application in infection control. Examination results from the year 3, infection control spot test were compared with those of earlier years. In addition, the opinions, as assessed by questionnaire analysis, of dental staff and students on the infection control competency were obtained. Results: All students successfully completed the infection control competency (either at first or second attempt) and were subsequently allowed to enter clinical training in year 3. Significant improvements were seen in students passing the course at their initial attempt, 42% and 78%, in the 2004 and 2005 academic years, respectively. Also subsequent testing of these students during their first year on clinic showed marked increases in awareness and knowledge of the infection control protocols. Staff and student feedback on this course was also found to be highly supportive of the introduction of the infection control competency. Conclusion: Incorporation of additional formal pre‐clinical teaching and introduction of an infection competency potentially provides enduring knowledge and clinical application benefits.","Milward, Mike R.; Cooper, Paul R.",Eur J Dent Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17640258/,470

Although the entry of herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) by endocytosis has been documented in different cell types, its dependence on clathrin has not been described whereas its dependence on dynamin has been shown according to the cell line used. The present work shows how clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is one way that HSV-1 infects the human oligodendroglial (HOG) cell line. Partial dynamin inhibition using dynasore revealed a relationship between decrease of infection and dynamin inhibition, measured by viral titration and immunoblot. Co-localization between dynamin and HSV-1 was verified by immunofluorescence at the moment of viral entry into the cell. Inhibition by chlorpromazine revealed that viral progeny also decreased when clathrin was partially inhibited in our cell line. RT-qPCR of immediately early viral genes, specific entry assays and electron microscopy all confirmed clathrin’s participation in HSV-1 entry into HOG cells. In contrast, caveolin entry assays showed no effect on the entry of this virus. Therefore, our results suggest the participation of dynamin and clathrin during endocytosis of HSV-1 in HOG cells.","Praena, Beatriz; Bello-Morales, Raquel; López-Guerrero, José Antonio",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12070734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645983/,470

Macroautophagy (MaA), chaperone-mediated autophagy, and microautophagy are the three main types of autophagy. It is regulated by the integration of signaling from the AMPK and mTOR-ULK1 pathways. Autophagy plays a physiological role in health, and its dysregulation could be a pathophysiologic mechanism in different disease conditions. In the current study, we reviewed papers of Google Scholar database, PubMed, PubMed Central, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, and MedlinePlus with no time limitation and a recent World Health Organization report. In the current review, it could be concluded that autophagy plays many physiological functions, including immune system modulation, and regulates different cellular processes such as metabolism, protein synthesis, and cellular transportation. Dysregulation of autophagy is implicated in tumorigenesis, aging, age-related neurodegeneration, and endothelial dysfunctions. Autophagy dysregulation is also implicated in the newly discovered CoV-COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Alharbi, Yasser M.; Bima, Abdulhadi I.; Elsamanoudy, Ayman Z.",J Microsc Ultrastruct,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350099/; https://doi.org/10.4103/jmau.jmau_33_20,470

Methods: This retrospective, observational, cohort study enrolled 49 patients with Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19, which included 30 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Third Hospital and 19 patients either admitted to or receiving telemedicine consultation from Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Xuhui Dahua Hospital, and hospitals in other provinces. CT scans were performed in all enrolled patients and the radiographic features including simple ground-glass opacities (GGOs), GGO with interlobular septal thickening, consolidations with GGO, and consolidations only were monitored by repeating the CT. The progression of these radiographic features was analyzed in combination with their clinical staging and the time interval between onset of symptoms to CT. Results: Based on illness severity, the 49 patients were classified into four stages: mild (n = 6), moderate (n = 12), severe (n = 16), and critically ill (n = 15). The CT findings were classified into three phases: early (n = 5), progression (n = 39), and recovery (n = 5). Among the 49 patients, 9 had bilateral diffuse GGO or diffuse consolidations (white lungs) and were counted as 18 lesions. Three patients had no abnormal findings on initial CT, but their repeat CT showed new lesions. In all, we identified 892 lesions including simple GGO, GGO with interlobular septal thickening, consolidations with GGO, and consolidations only. Conclusions: Most patients had pulmonary lesions on the posterior, inferior, and peripheral lung fields on CT. The development of GGO with interlobular septal thickening, GGO with consolidations, and consolidations only happened mainly between days 8 and 14. The emergence of consolidations may suggest the progression to the severe phase of the illness, whereas simple consolidations or “white lung” may suggest a critically ill phase.","Xie, Yun; Yang, Luyu; Dong, Hui; Cao, Song; Zhang, Wenkai; Chen, Qiong; Jin, Baoliang; Zhou, Zhiguo; Liu, Jun; He, Zhiyan; Wang, Ruilan",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667100X2100013X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667100X2100013X?v=s5,470

661883,Hospital Collaboration in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Kansas City Metropolitan Region,2021-04-19,"BACKGROUND: There have been large regional differences in COVID-19 virus activity across the UK with many commentators suggesting that these are related to age, ethnicity and social class. There has also been a focus on cases, hospitalisations and deaths rather than on hospitalisation rates expressed per 100,000 population. The purpose of our study was to examine regional variation in COVID-19 positive hospitalisation rates in Scotland during the first wave of the pandemic and the possibility that these might be related to population density. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a repeated point prevalence study. The number of COVID-19 positive patients hospitalised in the eleven Scottish mainland health boards peaked at 1517 on 19th April, then fell to a low of 243 on 16th August before rising slightly to 262 on 15th September. In July, August and September only four boards had more than 5 hospitalised patients. There was a statistically significant relationship between hospitalisation rates and population density on 97.7% of individual days during the first wave of the pandemic (Pearson’s r 0.62–0.93, with 123 of a possible 174 days having p values <0.001). Multiple linear regression analyses performed on data from the 11 mainland boards across six time points suggest that population density accounted for 70.2% of the variation in hospitalisation rate in April, 72.3% in May, 81.2% in June, 91.0% in July, 91.0% in August, and 88.1% in September. Neither population median age nor median social deprivation score at health board level were statistically significant in the final model for hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: There were large differences in crude COVID-19 hospitalisation rates across the 11 mainland Scottish health boards, that were significantly related to population density. Given that lockdown was originally introduced to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed, we believe our results support a regional rather than a national approach to lifting or reimposing more restrictive measures, and that hospitalisation rates should be part of the decision making process.","Rideout, Andrew; Murray, Calum; Isles, Chris",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34242268/,470

Primary precursors such as NO and CO dropped dramatically as early as 13 March 2020, due to school closures, but ambient ozone did not change. In this work we use a chemical box model in order to estimate regimes of ozone production before and after the lockdown. We constrain the model with observations in Quito (ozone, NO(x), CO, and meteorology) and with estimations of traffic-associated VOCs that are tightly linked to CO. To this end, we use the closest observational data of VOC/CO ratios at an urban area that shares with Quito conditions of high altitude and is located in the tropics, namely Mexico City. A shift in the chemical regime after mobility restrictions was evaluated in light of the magnitude of radical losses to nitric acid and to hydrogen peroxide. With reduced NO(x) in the morning rush hour (lockdown conditions), ozone production rates at 08:30–10:30 increased from 4.2 to 17 to 9.7–23 ppbv h(−1), respectively. To test further the observed shift in chemical regime, ozone production was recalculated with post-lockdown NO(x) levels, but setting VOCs to pre-lockdown conditions. This change tripled ozone production rates in the mid-morning and stayed higher throughout the day. In light of these findings, practical scenarios that present the potential for ozone accumulation in the ambient air are discussed.","Cazorla, María; Herrera, Edgar; Palomeque, Emilia; Saud, Nicolás",Atmos Pollut Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32863711/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1309104220302567?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1309104220302567; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2020.08.028,470

We developed a twofold framework in this study, which is composed by one novel descriptive model to depict the recurrent global outbreaks of COVID-19 and one dynamic model to understand the intrinsic mechanisms of recurrent outbreaks. We used publicly available data of cumulative infected cases from 1 January 2020 to 2 January 2021 in 30 provinces in China and 43 other countries around the world for model validation and further analyses. These time series data could be well fitted by the new descriptive model. Through this quantitative approach, we discovered two main mechanisms that strongly correlate with the extent of the recurrent outbreak: the sudden increase in cases imported from overseas and the relaxation of local government epidemic prevention policies. The compartmental dynamical model (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Dead and Recovered (SEIDR) Model) could reproduce the obvious recurrent outbreak of the epidemics and showed that both imported infected cases and the relaxation of government policies have a causal effect on the emergence of a new wave of outbreak, along with variations in the temperature index. Meanwhile, recurrent outbreaks affect consumer confidence and have a significant influence on GDP. These results support the necessity of policies such as travel bans, testing of people upon entry, and consistency of government prevention and control policies in avoiding future waves of epidemics and protecting economy.","Han, Chuanliang; Li, Meijia; Haihambo, Naem; Babuna, Pius; Liu, Qingfang; Zhao, Xixi; Jaeger, Carlo; Li, Ying; Yang, Saini",Nonlinear Dyn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758464/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11071-021-06371-w,470

The ability of nursing homes to invest in quality improvement initiatives may depend on resource availability. In this study, we sought to examine whether lower profit margins, as a proxy for lack of resources, are associated with persistent infection control citations. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Medicare-certified nursing homes in the US with financial and facility characteristics data (n = 12,194). METHODS: We combined facility-level data on nursing home profit margins from Medicare Cost Reports with deficiency citation data from Nursing Home Compare (2017-2019) and facility characteristics data from LTCFocus.org. We descriptively analyzed infection control citations by profit margins quintiles. We used logistic regressions to examine the relationship between profit margin quintiles and citations for infection prevention and control, adjusting for facility and market characteristics. RESULTS: About three-fourths of all facilities received deficiency citations for infection prevention and control during 1 or more years from 2017 to 2019 with about 10% of facilities cited in all 3 years. Facilities in the highest profit margin quintile had 7.6% of facilities with citations for infection prevention and control in each of the 3 years compared with 8.1%, 10.0%, 10.7%, and 13.7% for facilities in the fourth, third, second, and first quintiles of profit margins, respectively. Multivariable regressions showed that facilities with the lowest profit margins (first quintile) had 54.3% higher odds of being cited in at least 1 year and 87.6% higher odds of being cited in each of the 3 years compared with facilities with the highest profit margins (fifth quintile). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings indicate that nursing homes may need more resources to prevent citations for infection prevention and control.","Sharma, Hari; Xu, Lili",J Am Med Dir Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33930318/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525861021003339; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861021003339; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2021.03.024,470

663663,Protecting children from maltreatment during COVID-19: Struggling to see children and their families through the lockdowns,2021-04-27,"Many countries hit by the COVID-19 epidemic consider the introduction of vaccination passes. So far, no thorough impact assessment of vaccination passes and of lower restrictions for their holders has been conducted. Here, we propose the VAP-SIRS model that accounts for susceptible, infected, and recovered subpopulations, also within the group of vaccinated pass holders. The model accounts for imperfect vaccination effectiveness, revaccinations and waning immunity. Different restrictions for pass holders and the rest of the population result in different scenarios of the epidemic evolution, some of which yield unfavourable COVID-19 dynamics and new waves. We identify critical variables that should be considered by policymakers and show how unfavourable outcomes can be avoided using adaptive policies. In particular, while pass holders could initially be allowed large freedoms, the gradual loss of immunity will require either increased restrictions for pass holders, or accelerated revaccination. In the long-term, common restrictions for both the pass holders and the rest of the population will have to be kept to avoid epidemic resurgence. Such minimum required restrictions depend on vaccination effectiveness, revaccination rate, waning rate and fraction of never-vaccinated population, and, for realistic combinations of these parameters, range between 29% and 69% reduction of contacts.","Krueger, T.; Gogolewski, K.; Bodych, M.; Gambin, A.; Giordano, G.; Cuschieri, S.; Czypionka, T.; Perc, M.; Petelos, E.; Rosinska, M.; Szczurek, E.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.07.21256847; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.07.21256847v1?rss=1,470

Several hundred trials are ongoing globally in the hope of a solution. However, nearly all treatments rely on systemic delivery but COVID-19 damages the lungs preferentially. The use of a targeted delivery approach is reviewed where engineered products are able to reach damaged lung tissue directly, which includes catheter-based and aerosol-based approaches. In this review we have outlined various target directed approaches which include microbubbles, extracellular vesicles including exosomes, adenosine nanoparticles, novel bio-objects, direct aerosol targeted pulmonary delivery and catheter-based drug delivery with reference to their relative effectiveness for the specific lesions. Currently several trials are ongoing to determine the effectiveness of such delivery systems alone and in conjunction with systemic therapies. Such approaches may prove to be very effective in the controlled and localized COVID-19 viral lesions in the lungs and potential sites. Moreover, localized delivery offered a safer delivery mode for such drugs which may have systemic adverse effects.","Kipshidze, Nicholas; Iversen, Patrick; Porter, Thomas R.; Kipshidze, Nodar; Siddiqui, Fakiha; Dangas, George; Fareed, Jawed",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32936689/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1076029620954911,470

Design: A cross-sectional survey collecting data in Hong Kong and Fujian Province of China. Self-administered questionnaires were collected via online platform in April 2020. Participants: A convenience and snowball sample of 2706 students aged 18 years or older and studying a healthcare programme in Hong Kong or Fujian. Setting: Students were recruited in tertiary education institutions/universities in Hong Kong and Putian (a prefecture-level city in eastern Fujian province). The institutions offered various healthcare programmes in degree or sub-degree levels. Main outcome measures: Compliances to social distancing and personal hygiene measures were assessed by 10-item Social Distancing Scale and 5-item Personal Hygiene Scale respectively. Path analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the compliance outcomes. Results: The participants reported high compliances to both social distancing and personal hygiene measures. Confidence to manage the current situation, wishful thinking and empathetic responding directly predicted compliance to social distancing ({beta}=-0.31, p<0.001; {beta}=0.35, p=0.015; {beta}=0.33, p<0.001 respectively) and personal hygiene measures ({beta}=-0.16, p<0.001; {beta}=0.21, p<0.001; {beta}=0.16, p<0.001 respectively). Gender, geographical location, and clinical experience were the only three demographic variables having direct and/or indirect effects on social distancing and personal hygiene measures. The final model constructed demonstrated a very good fit to the data (Chi-square X2=27.27, df=17, P=0.044; X2/df=1.61; GFI=0.998, CFI=0.997, TLI=0.992, RMSEA=0.015). Conclusions: The predictive model constructed in this study is the first one to explore factors associating with the compliance to infection control measures in healthcare students amid the COVID-19 outbreak. The findings suggest that students who are male, habituate in Hong Kong, have more clinical experience and weak confidence to manage the threat tend to have lower compliance to social distancing and personal hygiene measures. Wishful thinking, contrasting to previous studies, was first found to positively associate with adherence to COVID-19 control measures.","Tang, A. C. Y.; Kwong, E. W. Y.; Chen, L.; Cheng, W. L.

We aimed to report the demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, molecular results, and treatment outcomes of 2 FD cases. This study was a retrospective review of 2 family clusters of FD on follow-up in Sarawak, Malaysia. CASE REPORTS: Two index patients were confirmed to have FD. Index patient 1, who had nephrotic-range proteinuria and cornea verticillata, carried a variant within exon 4 of the GLA gene: c.610 T>C (p.Trp204Arg). Agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme(®)) enzyme replacement therapy was initiated, with the absence of neutralizing antibody after 24 months. No hypersensitivity or adverse reactions were reported. The patient’s proteinuria and renal function remained stable. Other family members who carried the same mutation were asymptomatic. Index patient 2, who had residual activity of α-galactosidase A and a normal globotriaosylsphingosine level, carried a novel GLA mutation of c.548-5T>A. He was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease on regular dialysis and had nonspecific headache with 1 episode of seizure a few years prior to FD genetic screening. One brother had chronic neuropathic pain but refused further investigations. Other family members who had the same mutation were asymptomatic. This mutation has never been reported in literature, and its pathogenicity warrants further studies. CONCLUSIONS: It is of utmost importance to increase awareness of FD among clinicians, so that appropriate screening may be done to determine its true prevalence and prompt treatment can be initiated early.","Tang, Andy Sing Ong; Wong, Qi Ying; Ting, Ingrid Pao Lin; Selvesten, Panting; Yeo, Siaw Tze; Chew, Lee Ping; Fam, Tem Lom; Tan, Clare Hui Hong",Am J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.932923; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34354036/,470

India experiences some of the highest RTC mortality and morbidity rates globally, but advocacy and effective action to mitigate this has been limited. We conducted an analysis of Indian media in English to assess whether coverage met the WHO’s Reporting on Road Safety guidelines for evidence-based reporting of RTCs. METHODS: English-language articles published online between March 2018 and February 2019 were assessed against the seven recommended story angles and seven recommended key elements in the WHO guidelines. RESULTS: 458 articles were included in the analysis. The most common story angle was descriptions of single collisions, which was not a WHO-recommended story angle. These included limited key elements such as use of human story or linking to road safety risks or evidence-based solutions. However, some articles did follow the WHO-recommended story angles, with 22.1% discussing specific road safety solutions and a further 6.3% discussing vulnerable groups. Almost all articles avoided the use of technical language, but only 2.0% explicitly stated that RTCs were preventable. More than half identified at least one evidence-based solution. Very few articles discussed economic or health impacts of RTCs, including the burden they present to the public health system. CONCLUSION: Indian media in English can improve reporting by focusing on human stories and documenting experiences of those injured in RTCs. Coverage should also focus more on evidence-based solutions, emphasising the systems approach which encourages government action rather than changes to individual behaviour.","Gupta, Medhavi; Kakar, Inayat Singh; Peden, Margaret; Altieri, Elena; Jagnoor, Jagnoor",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789868/,470

The aim of this study was to develop efficient bacterial source tracking capabilities to identify sources of Escherichia coli aerosol pollution caused by pigs. Airborne E. coli were isolated from indoor air, upwind air (10 and 50 m away) and downwind air samples (10, 50, 100, 200 and 400 m away) for five swine houses using six-stage Andersen microbial samplers and Reuter-Centrifugal samplers (RCS). E. coli strains from pig fecal samples were also collected simultaneously. The enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerize chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) and the repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP-PCR) approaches were used to study the genetic variability and to determine the strain relationships among E. coli isolated from different sites in each swine house. Results showed that 35.1% (20/57) of the bacterial DNA fingerprints from the fecal isolates matched with the corresponding strains isolated from indoor and downwind air samples (similarity ⩾90%). E. coli strains from the indoor and downwind air samples were closely related to the E. coli strains isolated from feces, while those isolated from upwind air samples (swine house C) had low similarity (61–69%). Our results suggest that some strains isolated from downwind and indoor air originated in the swine feces.

In addition, DDX3 is also implicated in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, Wnt-β-catenin signaling, tumorigenesis, and viral infection. Notably, recent studies suggest that DDX3 is a component of anti-viral innate immune signaling pathways. Indeed, DDX3 contributes to enhance the induction of anti-viral mediators, interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 and type I IFN. However, DDX3 seems to be an important target for several viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and poxvirus. DDX3 interacts with HIV-1 Rev or HCV Core protein and modulates its function. At least, DDX3 is required for both HIV-1 and HCV replication.

Globally, the COVID-19 has a transforming effect on health care provision. Substantial evidence was clear that the global surgical services were impacted. The field of neurosurgery was primarily affected, and most elective surgeries were suspended. There are no current reports from Egypt that describe the mortality outcome of neurosurgical procedures in the context of the pandemic. METHODS: We performed that study at a large tertiary center in Egypt (Cairo University Hospital). It is a single-center matched cohort study. RESULTS: Our results examined about 346 patients earlier during the COVID-19 pandemic. About 46 (13.29%) were unmatched, so we excluded them from the final analysis of the data. About 300 patients' were matched to 304 patients' before the pandemic in 2019. The mortality outcome of neurosurgical interventions was higher during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the mortality outcome of neurosurgical procedures was higher than on regular days at our center.

First, the NOS activity in haemocytes of shrimps was determined by the means of NBT reduction and changes in cell conformation. And the variations of NOS activity in shrimps after challenge with WSSV intramuscularly were evaluated through the analysis of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate (both as NO derivates) concentrations. The result showed that NOS activity in the haemocytes of F. chinensis increased slightly from 0 to 12 h postchallenge, indicated by the variations of l-citrulline (from 11.15 ± 0.10 to 12.08 ± 0.64 μM) and total nitrite/nitrate concentrations (from 10.45 ± 0.65 to 12.67 ± 0.52 μM). Then it decreased sharply till the end of the experiment (84 h postchallenge), the concentrations of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate at 84 h were 1.58 ± 0.24 and 2.69 ± 0.70 μM, respectively. The LPS-stimulated NOS activity kept constant during the experiment. However, in M. japonicus, the NOS activity kept increasing during the first 72 h postchallenge, the concentrations of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate increased from 7.82 ± 0.77 at 0 h to 10.79 ± 0.50 μM at 72 h, and from 8.98 ± 0.43 at 0 h to 11.20 ± 0.37 μM at 72 h, respectively. Then it decreased till the end of the experiment (216 h postchallenge), and the concentrations of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate at 216 h were 5.66 ± 0.27 and 4.68 ± 0.16 μM, respectively. More importantly, an apparent increase of LPS-stimulated NOS activity was observed in M. japonicus at 48 h postchallenge, which was about 4 times higher than that in the control group of health shrimps. In correspondence with the difference of NOS activity between the two species of shrimps, the cumulative mortalities of the shrimps were also different. All shrimps of F. chinensis in the mortality experiment died in 66 h, much more quickly than M. japonicus, whose accumulative mortality reached 100% after 240 h. Data here reported let us hypothesize that NOS activity in the haemocytes of shrimps F. chinensis and M. japonicus responses to WSSV infection differently, and this might be one of the reasons for the different susceptibility of F. chinensis and M. japonicus to WSSV infection.","Jiang, Guojian; Yu, Rencheng; Zhou, Mingjiang",Nitric Oxide,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1089860305001722; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089860305001722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16403661/,470

Although few studies have used computed tomographic scans to confirm the diagnosis, this could be challenging in resource-limited setup. We present a series of 15 cases that highlight the clinical heterogeneity with respect to stage of illness, ventilatory status, and varied clinical scenarios at the time of development of these syndromes. All cases in our series were diagnosed clinically and confirmed by bedside chest X-ray and were managed promptly. Though mortality was not so infrequent in our experience, these air-leak syndromes were not directly attributed as cause of death in these patients. Therefore, high level of clinical suspicion and vigilance is necessary to identify and manage cases of air-leak syndrome.

This study examines the perceptions and attitudes of small family farmers toward climate change and identifies adaptation strategies supporting household food security in the Middle Eastern context, Lebanon. The study uses cross-sectional, primary data of households that own small family farms in the Central Bekaa region. The results show that the majority of the households believe that climate change is occurring, has adverse impacts on livelihoods, and is attributable to human factors. They perceived an increase in temperature and a decrease in rainfall patterns over the last 20 years. In response, the households used multiple agricultural practices to adapt to climate change. Based on the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) scores, only 7.5% of the households were food secure, while 89% were mild to moderately food insecure. Generally, the households had modest access to nutritious diets. All the households used two or more environmentally sustainable agricultural practices. However, the use of multiple environmentally sustainable practices did not correlate with improved food security. This latter result may be due to the limited knowledge of the farmers about trade-offs between various climate change adaptation measures. The findings suggest the need to refocus research from the question of whether small family farmers are willing to adopt (or not) climate change adaptation practices to identifying those practices that are capable of balancing economic, social, and environmental goals in a specific context.","Al Dirani, Aliaa; Abebe, Gumataw Kifle; Bahn, Rachel A.; Martiniello, Giuliano; Bashour, Isam",Food Secur,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12571-021-01188-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34221190/,470

Our results provide evidence that when responding to PCAOB sanctions, BOAs under Republican regimes impose less severe penalties than do BOAs under Democratic regimes. Our data and analyses inform the regulatory and enforcement practices of the accounting profession and other professions. Most directly, motivated by improvements in technology that facilitate the cross-jurisdiction practice of public accounting, states have adopted mobility laws where CPAs are only required to be licensed in their state of residence to practice in multiple states. These laws simplify licensing but may complicate enforcement. Beyond generalized red-state, blue-state differences in enforcement, we find that non-resident CPAs receive less severe disciplinary actions. If not reasonably consistent across BOAs, regulators may be unwilling to delegate responsibility for enforcement to another state’s BOA.","Al-Moshaigeh, Abdullah; Dickins, Denise; Higgs, Julia L.",J Bus Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-020-04733-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33487784/,470

The defensin class of AMPs represented an evolutionarily ancient family containing cationic cysteine residue and frequently expressed in epithelial or neutrophils cells. It plays myriad functions in host innate immune responses against various infection. Defensin has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities, including anti-bacteria, anti-viruses (AVPs), anti-fungi, anti-cancers, and also overcoming bacterial drug resistance. In this review, we compiled the progress on defensin, particularly incorporating the mechanism of action, their application as an antiviral agent, prospects in different areas, and limitations to be solved as an antiviral peptide. Defensins were explored, in particular, their capacity to stimulate innate and adaptive immunity by trigging as anti-coronavirus (COVID-19) peptides.

671650,Life after COVID-19: preparing for changes in mental healthcare service demand,2020-06-02,"ABSTRACT: The non-structural protein (nsp)-3 of SARS-CoV2 coronavirus is sought to be an essential target protein which is also named as papain-like protease (PLpro). This protease cleaves the viral polyprotein, but importantly in human host it also removes ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulated gene 15 protein (ISG15) from interferon responsive factor 3 (IRF3) protein which ultimately downregulates the production of type I interferon leading to weakening of immune response. GRL0617 is the most potent known inhibitor for PLpro that was initially developed for SARS outbreak of 2003. The PLpro of SARS-CoV and CoV2 share 83% sequence identity but interestingly have several identical conserved amino acids that suggests GRL0617 to be an effective inhibitor for PLpro of SARS-CoV2. GRL0617 is a naphthalene-based molecule and interacts with Tyr268 of SARS-CoV2-PLpro (and Tyr269 of SARS-CoV-PLpro). To identify PLpro inhibitors, we prepared a library of secondary metabolites from fungi with aromatic nature and docked them with PLpro of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2. We found six hits which interacts with Tyr268 of SARS-CoV2-PLpro (and Tyr269 of SARS-CoV-PLpro). More surprisingly the top hit, Fonsecin, has naphthalene moiety in its structure, which recruits Tyr268 of SARS-CoV2-PLpro (and Tyr269 of SARS-CoV-PLpro) and has binding energy at par with control (GRL0617). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation showed Fonsecin to interact with Tyr268 of SARS-CoV2-PLpro more efficiently than control (GRL0617) and interacting with a greater number of amino acids in the binding cleft of PLpro.

No definitive therapy exists to treat sepsis and physicians rely on supportive care including antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors. With the rising incidence of antibiotic resistant microbes, it is becoming increasingly critical to discover novel therapeutics. Sepsis-induced leukocyte dysfunction and immunosuppression is recognized as an important contributor towards increased morbidity and mortality. Pre-clinical and clinical studies show that specific cell surface inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors and ligands including PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA4, BTLA, TIM3, OX40, and 2B4 play important roles in the pathophysiology of sepsis by mediating a fine balance between host immune competency and immunosuppression. Pre-clinical studies targeting the inhibitory effects of these immune checkpoints have demonstrated reversal of leukocyte dysfunction and improved host resistance of infection. Measurement of immune checkpoint expression on peripheral blood leukocytes may serve as a means of stratifying patients to direct individualized therapy. This review focuses on advances in our understanding of the role of immune checkpoints in the host response to infections, and the potential clinical application of therapeutics targeting the inhibitory immune checkpoint pathways for the management of septic patients.","McBride, Margaret A.; Patil, Tazeen K.; Bohannon, Julia K.; Hernandez, Antonio; Sherwood, Edward R.; Patil, Naeem K.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.624272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33613563/,470

However, the seasonal and interannual risks of pathogens importation and onward transmission from endemic countries have rarely been quantified and validated. We constructed a modelling framework, integrating air travel, epidemiological, demographical, entomological and meteorological data, to measure the seasonal probability of dengue introduction from endemic countries. This framework has been applied retrospectively to elucidate spatiotemporal patterns and increasing seasonal risk of dengue importation from South-East Asia into China via air travel in multiple populations, Chinese travelers and local residents, over a decade of 2005–15. We found that the volume of airline travelers from South-East Asia into China has quadrupled from 2005 to 2015 with Chinese travelers increased rapidly. Following the growth of air traffic, the probability of dengue importation from South-East Asia into China has increased dramatically from 2005 to 2015. This study also revealed seasonal asymmetries of transmission routes: Sri Lanka and Maldives have emerged as origins; neglected cities at central and coastal China have been increasingly vulnerable to dengue importation and onward transmission. Compared to the monthly occurrence of dengue reported in China, our model performed robustly for importation and onward transmission risk estimates. The approach and evidence could facilitate to understand and mitigate the changing seasonal threat of arbovirus from endemic regions.","Lai, Shengjie; Johansson, Michael A.; Yin, Wenwu; Wardrop, Nicola A.; van Panhuis, Willem G.; Wesolowski, Amy; Kraemer, Moritz U.

673421,How can medical schools compensate for the loss of clinical placements during the COVID-19 pandemic?,2021-07-01,"In recent years, the introduction of real-time simulators (RTS) has changed the way of researching the power network. In particular, researchers and system operators (SOs) are now capable of simulating the complete network and of making it interact with the real world thanks to the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) and digital twin (DT) concepts. Such tools create infinite scenarios in which the network can be tested and virtually monitored to, for example, predict and avoid faults or energy shortages. Furthermore, the real-time monitoring of the network allows estimating the status of the electrical assets and consequently undertake their predictive maintenance. The success of the HIL and DT application relies on the fact that the simulated network elements (cables, generation, accessories, converters, etc.) are correctly modeled and characterized. This is particularly true if the RTS acquisition capabilities are used to enable the HIL and the DT. To this purpose, this work aims at emphasizing the role of a preliminary characterization of the virtual elements inside the RTS system, experimentally verifying how the overall performance is significantly affected by them. To this purpose, a virtual phasor measurement unit (PMU) is tested and characterized to understand its uncertainty contribution. To achieve that, firstly, the characterization of a virtual PMU calibrator is described. Afterward, the virtual PMU calibration is performed, and the results clearly highlight its key role in the overall uncertainty. It is then possible to conclude that the characterization of the virtual elements, or models, inside RTS systems (omitted most of the time) is fundamental to avoid wrong results. The same concepts can be extended to all those fields that exploit HIL and DT capabilities.","Mingotti, Alessandro; Costa, Federica; Cavaliere, Diego; Peretto, Lorenzo; Tinarelli, Roberto",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21186133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577340/,470
673838,Alternative Strategies of Home Therapy in Clinical Orthopaedics during COVID-19 Pandemic: a Hand Surgeon Perspective,2020-07-11,"BACKGROUND: Patient portals are consumer health applications that allow patients to view their health information. Portals facilitate the interactions between patients and their caregivers by offering secure messaging. Patients communicate different needs through portal messages. Medical needs contain requests for delivery of care (e.g. reporting new symptoms). Automating the classification of medical decision complexity in portal messages has not been investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We trained two multiclass classifiers, multinomial Naïve Bayes and random forest on 500 message threads, to quantify and label the complexity of decision-making into four classes: no decision, straightforward, low, and moderate. We compared the performance of the models to using only the number of medical terms without training a machine learning model. RESULTS: Our analysis demonstrated that machine learning models have better performance than the model that did not use machine learning. Moreover, machine learning models could quantify the complexity of decision-making that the messages contained with 0.59, 0.45, and 0.58 for macro, micro, and weighted precision and 0.63,0.41, and 0.63 for macro, micro, and weighted recall. CONCLUSIONS: This study is one of the first to attempt to classify patient portal messages by whether they involve medical decision-making and the complexity of that decision-making. Machine learning classifiers trained on message content resulted in better message thread classification than classifiers that employed medical terms in the messages alone.","Sulieman, Lina; Robinson, Jamie R.; Jackson, Gretchen P.",J Surg Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022480420303127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32570124/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022480420303127; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2020.05.039,470

As per Chinese experience, approximately, 15% of patients of COVID-19 progress to severe disease and 5% become critically ill. The incidence of severe and critical illness is higher among men, patients older than 65 years of age and in persons with other medical comorbidities. Cytokine storm cause pronounced lung damage and multiorgan failure. Coagulopathy is a key component of severe COVID-19. Critically ill patients are generally predisposed to a high risk of thromboembolism as well. Lymphopenia predisposes to severe disease. None of the antiviral or immunomodulators has proven efficacy in severe COVID-19. Supplemental oxygen need be administered in patients with hypoxemia. Excessive breathing effort, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), encephalopathy, and multiorgan failure are indications for mechanical ventilation.

However, uncontrolled proteolytic activity of proteases results in various human diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, thrombosis, and autoimmunity. In addition, proteases can be hijacked by several viruses to prime virus-derived surface proteins and evade immune detection by entering into the host cell. Indeed, porcine elastase increases the suitability of host cells to be infected by SARS-CoV-1. We compared the cleavage sites of human NE, PR3, and CatG as well as porcine-derived trypsin within the amino acid sequence of the proteolytic sensitive activation loop at the interface of S1/S2 of the spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-1 as well as SARS-CoV-2. As a result, NE and PR3, but not CatG, hydrolyze the scissile peptide bond adjacent to the polybasic amino acid sequence of the S1/S2 interface of SARS-CoV-2, which is distinctive from SARS-CoV-1. These findings suggest that neutrophil-derived NE and PR3 participate in priming of the S1/S2 interface during an immune response.","Mustafa, Zhadyra; Zhanapiya, Anuar; Kalbacher, Hubert; Burster, Timo",ACS Omega,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.1c00363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33748632/,470
675394,Men's health: COVID-19 pandemic highlights need for overdue policy action,2020-06-18,"We develop an agent-based model to assess the cumulative number of deaths during hypothetical Covid-19-like epidemics for various non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies. The model simulates three interrelated stochastic processes: epidemic spreading, availability of respiratory ventilators and changes in death statistics. We consider local and non-local modes of disease transmission. The first simulates transmission through social contacts in the vicinity of the place of residence while the second through social contacts in public places: schools, hospitals, airports, etc., where many people meet, who live in remote geographic locations. Epidemic spreading is modelled as a discrete-time stochastic process on random geometric networks. We use the Monte–Carlo method in the simulations. The following assumptions are made. The basic reproduction number is [Formula: see text] and the infectious period lasts approximately ten days. Infections lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome in about one percent of cases, which are likely to lead to respiratory default and death, unless the patient receives an appropriate medical treatment. The healthcare system capacity is simulated by the availability of respiratory ventilators or intensive care beds. Some parameters of the model, like mortality rates or the number of respiratory ventilators per [Formula: see text] inhabitants, are chosen to simulate the real values for the USA and Poland. In the simulations we compare ‘do-nothing’ strategy with mitigation strategies based on social distancing and reducing social mixing. We study epidemics in the pre-vacine era, where immunity is obtained only by infection. The model applies only to epidemics for which reinfections are rare and can be neglected. The results of the simulations show that strategies that slow the development of an epidemic too much in the early stages do not significantly reduce the overall number of deaths in the long term, but increase the duration of the epidemic. In particular, a hybrid strategy where lockdown is held for some time and is then completely released, is inefficient.","Burda, Zdzislaw",Entropy (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/e22111236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33287004/,470

Methods: A social network campaign on Instagram was raised to approach the target population. The dental students responded to a multiple-response question asking where they get information about COVID-19. The possible answers were government official websites or health and education institutions websites, TV Programs, professors, social media, scientific articles, other health professionals, and family members. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and frequency distributions of responses were evaluated by gender, age, type of institution, and year of enrollment. Results: A total of 833 valid responses were received. The main source of information used by the dental students were government official websites or health and education institutions websites (88.7%), other health professionals (57.3%), and scientific articles (56.2%). The use of social media was reported by 54.1% of the students, while TV programs were information sources used by 39.9% of the students. The least used information sources were professors (38.1%) and family members (7.8%). Conclusions: The respondents seem to be acquainted to seek information in reliable sources and also use social media as a gateway to keep updated about the pandemics.

METHODS: The dance programme was developed in collaboration with British Lung Foundation Breathe Easy members in NE England (Darlington) and London (Haringey). Members of the Darlington group were invited to participate in the programme. An exercise instructor, trained and mentored by a dance facilitator delivered 60–90 min dance classes for 10 consecutive weeks. Exercise capacity, mobility, quadriceps strength, health status, mood and interoceptive awareness were assessed at baseline and after the 10-week programme. Second-to-second heart rate (HR) monitoring was conducted during one of the classes. RESULTS: Ten individuals were enrolled (n=8 women). Mean (SD) age was 70 (24); Body Mass Index 29.7 (8.1) kg/m(2); one participant used oxygen and one a walking aid. Seven completed the dance programme. Improvements in all outcome measures were detected, with the exception of the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness, which individuals found hard to comprehend. Eight participants wore HR monitors during one dance class and spent on average 43.5 (21.8) min with HR corresponding to at least moderate intensity physical activity (≥64% HRmax).

677008,The Impact of COVID-19 on Provider Perceptions of Telemental Health,2021-03-20,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated economic vulnerabilities and disrupted the Australian food supply, with potential implications for food insecurity. This study aims to describe the prevalence and socio-demographic associations of food insecurity in Tasmania, Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey (deployed late May to early June 2020) incorporated the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module: Six-Item Short Form, and fifteen demographic and COVID-related income questions. Survey data (n = 1170) were analyzed using univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression. The prevalence of food insecurity was 26%. The adjusted odds of food insecurity were higher among respondents with a disability, from a rural area, and living with dependents. Increasing age, a university education, and income above $80,000/year were protective against food insecurity. Food insecurity more than doubled with a loss of household income above 25% (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 2.02; 95% CI: 1.11, 3.71; p = 0.022), and the odds further increased with loss of income above 75% (AOR: 7.14; 95% CI: 2.01, 24.83; p = 0.002). Our results suggest that the prevalence of food insecurity may have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among economically vulnerable households and people who lost income. Policies that support disadvantaged households and ensure adequate employment opportunities are important to support Australians throughout and post the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kent, Katherine; Murray, Sandra; Penrose, Beth; Auckland, Stuart; Visentin, Denis; Godrich, Stephanie; Lester, Elizabeth",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12092682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887422/,470

With the preventive measures to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, all face-to-face teaching and learning are converted to e-learning. The COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of e-learning may influence these students' mental conditions. This study aimed to determine the association of factors with mental health status (depression, anxiety and stress) among university students in Malaysia. Study participants were tertiary education students from both the private and public universities in Malaysia. Participants were recruited via university emails and social media. The survey was administered via the online REDCap platform, from April to June 2020, during the movement control order period in the country. The questionnaire captured data on socio-demographic characteristics, academic information, implementation of e-learning, perception towards e-learning and COVID-19; as well as DASS 21 to screen for depression, anxiety and stress. The levels of stress, anxiety and depression were 56.5% (95% CI: 50.7%, 62.1%), 51.3% (95% CI: 45.6%, 57.0%) and 29.4% (95% CI: 24.3%, 34.8%) respectively. Most participants had good perception towards e-learning but negative perception on COVID-19. From the multivariate analysis, participants with positive perception on COVID-19 were protective towards stress (aOR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.99), anxiety (aOR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90, 0.98) and depression (aOR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.91, 0.99). Older students were 14% (aOR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.79, 0.94) and 11% (aOR: 0.89: 95% CI: 0.80, 0.99) less likely for anxiety and depression, respectively. Students originated from the Malay ethnicity had higher odds (aOR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.05, 3.56) for depression. These findings demonstrated that the mental status of university students was greatly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.

678011,Rapid Report 2: Symptoms of anxiety and depression during the first 12 weeks of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Australia,2020-10-22,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in China in late 2019 and is caused by newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Previous studies had reported the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture media and deposited onto surfaces under a limited set of environmental conditions. Here, we broadly investigated the effects of relative humidity, temperature, and droplet size on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in a simulated clinically relevant matrix dried on nonporous surfaces. The results show that SARS-CoV-2 decayed more rapidly when either humidity or temperature was increased but that droplet volume (1 to 50 μl) and surface type (stainless steel, plastic, or nitrile glove) did not significantly impact decay rate. At room temperature (24°C), virus half-life ranged from 6.3 to 18.6 h depending on the relative humidity but was reduced to 1.0 to 8.9 h when the temperature was increased to 35°C. These findings suggest that a potential for fomite transmission may persist for hours to days in indoor environments and have implications for assessment of the risk posed by surface contamination in indoor environments. IMPORTANCE Mitigating the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical settings and public spaces is critically important to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases while effective vaccines and therapeutics are under development. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is thought to primarily occur through direct person-to-person transfer of infectious respiratory droplets or through aerosol-generating medical procedures. However, contact with contaminated surfaces may also play a significant role. In this context, understanding the factors contributing to SARS-CoV-2 persistence on surfaces will enable a more accurate estimation of the risk of contact transmission and inform mitigation strategies. To this end, we have developed a simple mathematical model that can be used to estimate virus decay on nonporous surfaces under a range of conditions and which may be utilized operationally to identify indoor environments in which the virus is most persistent.","Biryukov, Jennifer; Boydston, Jeremy A.; Dunning, Rebecca A.; Yeager, John J.; Wood, Stewart; Reese, Amy L.; Ferris, Allison; Miller, David; Weaver, Wade; Zeitouni, Nathalie E.; Phillips, Aaron; Freeburger, Denise; Hooper, Idris; Ratnesar-Shumate, Shanna; Yolitz, Jason; Krause, Melissa; Williams, Gregory; Dawson, David G.; Herzog, Artemas; Dabisch, Paul; Wahl, Victoria; Hevey, Michael C.; Altamura, Louis A.",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00441-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32611701/,470

At present, development of specific treatment for COVID-19 is in progress and several countermeasures have been subjected to clinical trials. However, efficacy of these countermeasures is limited. For development of effective medicines or vaccines against infectious diseases, it is mandatory to elucidate its etiology and pathogenesis by means of pathological analysis. Pathological studies revealed that the COVID-19 mainly affects respiratory tracts although other organs are also involved. In addition, immunological studies demonstrated that host immune response may exacerbates COVID-19 through systemic inflammation.

However, some COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for emergency use, although the duration of their protection, their ability to interrupt viral transmission, and their efficacy against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 are being studied. Chile's SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign required design and planning, like any other campaign. This process included the prioritization of risk groups for vaccination given the limited supply of COVID-19 vaccines globally. Throughout 2020, CAVEI issued recommendations on the prioritization of population groups to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 in response to different needs and in accordance with available evidence. These recommendations are consolidated in Table 1 in this report. In summary, it was recommended that healthcare workers, people in long-term residences and essential State personnel be vaccinated in phase 1.

The effects of landscape heterogeneity on parasite communities are poorly understood, although it has been shown that anthropogenic impacts may contribute to outbreaks of both parasites and pathogens. We tested for effects of landcover type, composition, configuration, and urbanisation on avian diversity and avian malaria prevalence in 26 communities of wetland-associated passerines in the Western Cape of South Africa. We predicted that avian malaria prevalence would be influenced by the pattern of farmland and urban areas in the surrounding landscapes and the sizes of the wetlands in which birds were sampled. We quantified landscape pattern using a six-class simplification of the National Landcover data set at 35 × 35 m resolution and five extents of between 1 and 20 km from each wetland. The bird community was sampled using point counts and we collected blood samples from birds at each site. We screened these for malaria using PCR and molecular techniques. Passerine species richness and infection prevalence varied significantly between different landcover types. Host richness and parasite prevalence were highest in viticultural and cropping sites respectively and lowest in urban sites. Wetlands located in indigenous vegetation had intermediate numbers of bird species and intermediate parasite prevalence. Landscape composition and habitat type surrounding wetlands emerged as useful correlates of infection prevalence. Anthropogenic landscape modification appears to have both direct and indirect effects on avian communities and their associated parasite assemblages, with attendant consequences for avian health.","Okanga, Sharon; Cumming, Graeme S.; Hockey, Phillip A.

In some human tumors, including HNSCC, a number of mutations are caused by aberrantly activated DNA-modifying enzymes, such as the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) family of cytidine deaminases. As the enzymatic activity of APOBEC proteins contributes to the innate immune response to viruses, including HPV, the role of APOBEC proteins in HPV-driven head and neck carcinogenesis has recently gained increasing attention. Ongoing research efforts take the cue from two key observations: (1) APOBEC expression depends on HPV infection status in HNSCC; and (2) APOBEC activity plays a major role in HPV-positive HNSCC mutagenesis. This review focuses on recent advances on the role of APOBEC proteins in HPV-positive vs. HPV-negative HNSCC.","Riva, Giuseppe; Albano, Camilla; Gugliesi, Francesca; Pasquero, Selina; Pacheco, Sergio Fernando Castillo; Pecorari, Giancarlo; Landolfo, Santo; Biolatti, Matteo; Dell’Oste, Valentina",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22031402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33573337/,470

A Prospective Study Among Medical Students,2021-07-29,"To limit the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many individuals were instructed to stay at home, and teleworking became commonplace. Meanwhile, many others were laid off or worked reduced hours, and some front line workers were required to work longer hours. Concurrently, a surge in reports of “pandemic baking” suggested a cascade effect on eating behaviors, which may be an inadvertent strategy to cope with stress. We conducted an online survey of people living in Canada or the United States (N = 680) to assess how employment change may have been experienced as stressful and linked to a shift in food choices. Regression models suggested that reduced hours and being laid off were associated with greater stress appraisals, avoidant- and emotion-focused coping responses, and negative affect. In turn, negative affect was associated with eating to cope and unhealthy snack choices, like salty or sweet treats. Our study emphasizes that under stressful conditions, such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, some coping strategies may contribute to the greater vulnerability to downstream effects, particularly those relating to eating choices and nutritional balances.","Chee, Melissa J.; Koziel Ly, Nikita K.; Anisman, Hymie; Matheson, Kimberly",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33322367/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12123803,470

SARS-CoV-2 surface protein S presents as a trimer on the viral surface and is covered by a dense shield of N-linked glycans, and a few O-glycosites have been reported. The location of O-glycans is controlled by a large family of initiating enzymes with variable expression in cells and tissues and hence is difficult to predict. Here, we used our well-established O-glycoproteomic workflows to map the precise positions of O-linked glycosylation sites on three different entities of protein S—insect cell or human cell-produced ectodomains, or insect cell derived receptor binding domain (RBD). In total 25 O-glycosites were identified, with similar patterns in the two ectodomains of different cell origin, and a distinct pattern of the monomeric RBD. Strikingly, 16 out of 25 O-glycosites were located within three amino acids from known N-glycosites. However, O-glycosylation was primarily found on peptides that were unoccupied by N-glycans, and otherwise had low overall occupancy. This suggests possible complementary functions of O-glycans in immune shielding and negligible effects of O-glycosylation on subunit vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2.","Bagdonaite, Ieva; Thompson, Andrew J.; Wang, Xiaoning; Søgaard, Max; Fougeroux, Cyrielle; Frank, Martin; Diedrich, Jolene K.; Yates, John R.; Salanti, Ali; Vakhrushev, Sergey Y.; Paulson, James C.; Wandall, Hans H.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13040551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33806155/,470

While there have been data about the impact of COVID-19 on adult asthma, much remains unknown about the impact of COVID-19 on childhood asthma. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all pediatric patients aged 2 to 12 years who were admitted to Abha Maternity and Children Hospital for acute asthma exacerbation between June 1, 2020, and May 31, 2021, and underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Sixty children hospitalized with the diagnosis of asthma were included in the study. Out of these patients, 10 (16.7%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. The enrolled patients were between 2 and 12 years, with a median age of five years (interquartile range, 3.8), and 58% were males (35/60). Cough, shortness of breath, and hypoxia were the most common presenting symptoms and signs. Severe asthma was more prevalent among positive COVID-19 compared with negative COVID-19 patients (60 vs 20%; P= 0.016). In addition, chronic asthma for more than five years was more prevalent among positive COVID-19 than negative COVID-19 patients (60 vs 40%, P= 0.305). Fifty-five percent of the enrolled patients had eosinophilic asthma using a 300cells/μL threshold. None of the children required invasive respiratory support (ventilation through an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy), but 12 patients (21.7%) required respiratory support via high-flow nasal cannula. The total days of hospitalization in either PICU or pediatric general ward did not differ between the two groups. All patients were discharged, and there were no reports of serious morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSION: Eosinophilic asthma was the most prevalent asthma phenotype in the study group. Furthermore, there was no difference in the presenting symptoms of an asthma flare-up, laboratory indicators, and hospitalization outcomes (critical care admission and hospital stay) between asthmatics with and without a COVID-19 diagnosis.","Asseri, Ali Alsuheel",J Asthma Allergy,https://doi.org/10.2147/jaa.s326860; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34594113/,470

No meta-analysis has explored the impact of varied definitions of liver injury on the reported prevalence of liver injury. Moreover, few studies reported the extent of hypertransaminasemia stratified by COVID-19 disease severity. Methods: A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Embase. The pooled prevalence of liver injury and hypertransaminasemia was estimated. Results: In total, 60 studies were included. The overall prevalence of liver injury was 25%. Compared to subgroups with the non-strict definition of liver injury (33%) and subgroups without giving detailed definition (26%), the subgroup with a strict definition had a much lower prevalence of liver injury (9%). The overall prevalence of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation was 19% and 22%. The prevalence of elevated ALT and AST were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 cases compare to non-severe cases (31% vs 16% and 44% vs 11%). In critically ill and fatal cases, no difference was found in the prevalence of elevated ALT (24% vs 30%) or AST (54% vs 49%). Sensitivity analyses indicated that the adjusted prevalence of ALT elevation, AST elevation, and liver injury decreased to 14%, 7%, and 12%. Conclusion: The overall prevalence of liver injury and hypertransaminasemia in COVID-19 patients might be overestimated. Only a small fraction of COVID-19 patients have clinically significant liver injury. The prevalence of hypertransaminasemia was significantly higher in severe COVID-19 cases compare to non-severe cases.

681451,Feasibility and effectiveness of teleconsultation in children with epilepsy amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in a resource-limited country,2020-07-18,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel beta-coronavirus causing over 200.000 lethal cases within six months of first infecting humans. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, a form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). COVID-19 is characterized by two phases: the first resembles the flu with pneumonia, but after about seven or eight days the disease suddenly worsens to a sepsis-like syndrome. It is difficult to explain this virus-immune-pathology sequence from virology or immunology only. This paper hypothesizes that host-produced anti-spike protein antibodies are responsible for immune-induced viral dissemination. Subsequently, systemic distribution of virus-antibodies complexes activates the immune pathology observed in severe COVID-19. This hypothesis may be counterintuitive to immunologist that consider many anti-spike antibodies to be virus-neutralizing antibodies. Although anti-spike antibodies may hinder infection of epithelial cells, antibody binding to the spike protein may facilitate virus infection of myeloid leukocytes. If myeloid leukocytes reenter the circulation, they could spread the virus from a locoregional infection to a systemic disease. Disseminated virus in combination with antibodies results in dispersed virus-antibody complexes that overstimulate the immune system. The hypothesis aligns with the sequences of virus, immune and pathological events in COVID-19. The delay in onset from both syndromes results from an immune system still naïve to the non-cross-reactive spike protein. Details of this hypothesis are in concordance with many clinical characteristics of COVID-19, including its predominant lethality for the elderly, and the mostly asymptomatic course of disease in children. It predicts putative detrimental effects of vaccines that induce virus-neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein, as has been shown for other coronaviruses. This hypothesis has consequences for treatment of patients, evaluation of personal and herd immunity and vaccine development. In patients, cellular immunity should be stimulated. Neutralizing antibodies might not be indicative for immunity. Vaccines should aim to stimulate cellular immunity COVID-19 and/or stimulate humoral immunity against viral proteins except for the immunodominant spike protein.","Jacobs, J.J.L.",Med Hypotheses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720311270; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32512289/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720311270,470

Studying how people react and reflect on the information provided and how it affects their trust in health systems is essential for effective risk communication. This study was undertaken to explore and analyse newspaper readers’ reactions to the unfolding news of the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh and how this affected and shaped their compliance with the mitigation measures advised by the Government. METHODS: We collected readers’ comments on relevant news and features on the COVID-19 outbreak (n = 1,055) which were posted in the online versions of the four top circulating Bangla newspapers and one online news portal published during Jan.–Apr. 2020. A search protocol was developed and a team of three researchers searched and extracted data for content analysis according to some pre-determined study themes. RESULTS: Data analysis revealed several characteristics with implications for risk-communication: a faith-based and fatalistic attitude to the unfolding pandemic, a “denial” syndrome in the initial stage, a returning expatriate-bashing for specific countries, and a concern about the safety of the frontline health workers. The readers were resentful of the all-pervasive corruption in the health sector even in times of a pandemic and the Government's poorly coordinated, fragmented, and delayed COVID-19 response. The pandemic severely shook their trust in the already weak health system and perceived it to be incompetent, corrupt, and non-responsive. They had deplorable personal and family experiences while seeking treatment for COVID-19 patients. Expert committees were formed to advise the Government, but few recommendations were implemented on the ground. This helpless scenario made people sharply critical of the political leadership, especially for the failure of providing stewardship at the moment of crisis. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 related information reaching the people, including misinformation, disinformation, and rumours was equivocal in the early months of the pandemic and failed to build the trust and transparency that is necessary for an inclusive response across constituencies. The Government should pay attention and weightage to people's perceptions about its COVID-19 response and take appropriate measures to re-build trust for implementing pandemic control measures.","Tune, Samiun Nazrin Bente Kamal; Sarkar, Md.

The reaction types include elimination, solvolysis, condensation and oxidation, whether or not the substrates are pre-charged. In a detailed mechanistic study, we provide evidence using nanoESI showing that glass surfaces can act as strong bases and convert protic solvents into their conjugate bases which then act as bases/nucleophiles when participating in chemical reactions. In aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile, glass surfaces act as ‘green’ heterogeneous catalysts that can be recovered and reused after simple rinsing.

People with intellectual disability (ID) are especially vulnerable to the physical, mental and social effects of the pandemic. Cognitive impairments can limit understanding of information to protect them relying on carers to be vigilant on their behalf during quarantine. Restrictions on usual activities are likely to induce mental stress especially among those who are autistic leading to an escalation in challenging behaviours, risk of placement breakdown and increased the use of psychotropic medication. People with ID are vulnerable to exploitation by others where the usual community supports no longer function to protect them. In future pandemics, it is important that lessons are learned from the impacts COVID-19 have on people with ID. Collecting the evidence through a rigorous approach should help to empower people with ID and their carers to face future outbreaks of infectious diseases.","Courtenay, K.; Perera, B.",Irish journal of psychological medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404232/; https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.45,470
683965,Black-White Disparities in 2009 H1N1 Vaccination among Adults in the United States: A Cautionary Tale for the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-01-11,"BACKGROUND: Furin is a calcium-dependent protease that processes various precursor proteins through diverse secretory pathways. The deregulation of FURIN correlated with the prognosis of patients in numerous diseases. However, the role of FURIN in human pan-cancer is still largely unknown. METHODS: Multiple bioinformatic methods were employed to comprehensively analyze the correlation of FURIN expression with prognosis, mismatch repair (MMR), microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutational burden (TMB), DNA methylation, tumor immune infiltration, and common immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) from the public database, and aim to evaluate the potential prognostic value of FURIN across cancers. RESULTS: FURIN was aberrantly expressed and was strongly correlated with MMR, MSI, TMB, and DNA methylation in multiple types of cancer. Moreover, survival analysis across cancers revealed that FURIN expression was correlated with overall survival (OS) in four cancers, disease-specific survival (DSS) in five cancers, progression-free interval (PFI) in seven cancers, and disease-free interval (DFI) in two cancers. Also, FURIN expression was related to immune cell infiltration in 6 cancers and ImmuneScore/StromalScore in 10 cancers, respectively. In addition, FURIN expression also showed strong association between expression levels and immune checkpoint markers in three cancers. CONCLUSION: FURIN can serve as a significant prognostic biomarker and correlate with tumor immunity in human pan-cancer.","Zhou, Bolun; Gao, Shugeng",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33968987/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2021.648402,470

In this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analysis of this new virus. A phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequences of 2019‐nCoV, 12 whole genome sequences of 2019‐nCoV, and 12 highly similar whole genome sequences available in gene bank (five from the severe acute respiratory syndrome, two from Middle East respiratory syndrome, and five from bat SARS‐like coronavirus). Fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation analysis shows that the nucleocapsid and the spike glycoprotein have some sites under positive pressure, whereas homology modeling revealed some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019‐nCoV significantly clustered with bat SARS‐like coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in Spike Glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein. From these results, the new 2019‐nCoV is distinct from SARS virus, probably trasmitted from bats after mutation conferring ability to infect humans.","Benvenuto, Domenico; Giovanetti, Marta; Ciccozzi, Alessandra; Spoto, Silvia; Angeletti, Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31994738/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25688,470
684336,COVID-19 Pandemic in Nigeria: Palliative Measures and the Politics of Vulnerability,2020-07-08,"The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is having negative health, social and economic consequences worldwide. In Europe, the pandemic started to develop strongly at the end of February and beginning of March 2020. Subsequently, it spread over the continent, with special virulence in northern Italy and inland Spain. In this study we show that an unusual persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing in southwestern Europe during February 2020 (i.e. anomalously strong positive phase of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations) could have resulted in favorable conditions, e.g., in terms of air temperature and humidity among other factors, in Italy and Spain for a quicker spread of the virus compared with the rest of the European countries. It seems plausible that the strong atmospheric stability and associated dry conditions that dominated in these regions may have favored the virus propagation, both outdoors and especially indoors, by short-range droplet and aerosol (airborne) transmission, or/and by changing social contact patterns. Later recent atmospheric circulation conditions in Europe (July 2020) and the U.S. (October 2020) seem to support our hypothesis, although further research is needed in order to evaluate other confounding variables. Interestingly, the atmospheric conditions during the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 seem to resemble at some stage with the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Sanchez-Lorenzo, A.; Vaquero-Martínez, J.; Calbó, J.; Wild, M.; Santurtún, A.; Lopez-Bustins, J.A.; Vaquero, J.M.; Folini, D.; Antón, M.",Environ Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120315231?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110626; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120315231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33345895/,470

Project ECHO is a telementoring platform that uses video conferencing technology to educate and support healthcare professionals through case-based learning and brief lectures. This manuscript explores the results of a learning collaborative focused on combining QI and Project ECHO to increase human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates within pediatric practices. METHODS: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recruited 3 AAP chapters that then recruited individual pediatricians and their practices for participation. Participants responded to surveys regarding chapter and pediatrician experience and satisfaction. Impact on HPV immunization rates (HPV initiation, series completion, and missed opportunities to vaccinate during visits) was measured using practice reports of chart reviews to AAP’s data aggregator, which produced run charts. RESULTS: Thirty-four pediatricians within 8 practices completed the project; 1 practice withdrew. Physicians self-reported increased confidence in communicating with vaccine-hesitant families and implementing QI activities. We analyzed practice run charts utilizing QI run chart rules and found nonrandom change towards improvement for aggregate missed opportunities to vaccinate but not for HPV vaccine initiation or series completion. CONCLUSIONS: An HPV QI learning collaborative improved participant confidence in HPV vaccine communication and QI skills and decreased missed opportunities to vaccinate. Future projects should consider a more extended project period or more frequent data collection to reduce data variability to make it easier to spot nonrandom changes.","Oliver, Kristin; Beskin, Kera; Noonan, Laura; Shah, Amy; Perkins, Rebecca; Humiston, Sharon",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://doi.org/10.1097/pq9.0000000000000377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33409429/,470
685286,Clinical preventive services to reduce pandemic deaths,2020-11-25,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections can be treated with direct acting antivirals like acyclovir and foscarnet, but long-term use can lead to drug resistance, which motivates research into broadly-acting antivirals that can provide a greater genetic barrier to resistance. Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) employs a photosensitizer, light, and oxygen to create a local burst of reactive oxygen species that inactivate microorganisms. The botanical plant extract Orthoquin(TM) is a powerful photosensitizer with antimicrobial properties. Here we report that Orthoquin also has antiviral properties. Photoactivated Orthoquin inhibited herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection of target cells in a dose-dependent manner across a broad range of sub-cytotoxic concentrations. HSV inactivation required direct contact between Orthoquin and the inoculum, whereas pre-treatment of target cells had no effect. Orthoquin did not cause appreciable damage to viral capsids or premature release of viral genomes, as measured by qPCR for the HSV-1 genome. By contrast, immunoblotting for HSV-1 antigens in purified virion preparations suggested that higher doses of Orthoquin had a physical impact on certain HSV-1 proteins that altered protein mobility or antigen detection. Orthoquin PDI also inhibited the non-enveloped adenovirus (AdV) in a dose-dependent manner, whereas Orthoquin-mediated inhibition of the enveloped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was light-independent. Together, these findings suggest that the broad antiviral effects of Orthoquin-mediated PDI may stem from damage to viral attachment proteins.","Monjo, Andrea L.-A.; Pringle, Eric S.; Thornbury, Mackenzie; Duguay, Brett A.; Monro, Susan M.

The increasing spread of COVID-19 presents challenges for the clinical care of patients with gynecological tumors. The Multicenter Italian Trials in Ovarian cancer and gynecologic malignancies (MITO) performed a survey to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical treatment of gynecological cancer, with a focus on chemotherapy and oral treatment with poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARP-i). METHODS: The survey consisted of a self-administered online questionnaire, sent via email between November 2020 and January 2021 to all members of MITO group. RESULTS: Forty-nine centers completed the questionnaire. The majority of respondents (83%) use screening tests to determine COVID-19 status in patients who were to undergo chemotherapy or oral medications. All respondents to our survey continued cancer therapy in patients who tested negative for COVID-19 during the pandemic. Seventy-three percent of respondents declared they stopped treatment with chemotherapy or PARP-i only after a positive swab and resumed therapy when negative tests were confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 positivity impacted patterns of treatment in patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer within the MITO group. Further investigations are needed to evaluate whether these modifications influence oncological clinical outcomes.","Cioffi, Raffaella; Sabetta, Giulia; Rabaiotti, Emanuela; Bergamini, Alice; Bocciolone, Luca; Candotti, Giorgio; Candiani, Massimo; Valabrega, Giorgio; Mangili, Giorgia; Pignata, Sandro",Int J Gynecol Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2021-002784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34426526/,470

The study involved 401 adult participants currently residing in the Philippines. Data were collected using a self-reported online questionnaire administered to the participants. Findings revealed that one individual level factor, such as individual resilience, and two family level factors, such as safety at home and being a parent, negatively influenced psychological distress. On the other hand, a family level factor, family’s financial difficulties, positively predicted psychological distress. Societal level factor such as national resilience, but not the community level factor, community resilience, positively predicted psychological distress in Filipino adults. Findings identified individual resilience, national resilience, and financial difficulties as the strongest predictors of psychological distress among Filipino adults during the COVID-19 crisis.

686625,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Routine Childhood Immunization in Saudi Arabia,2020-10-03,"Background: Early reports in the COVID-19 pandemic suggested higher mortality for cancer patients. The impact of potentially immunosuppressive systemic anti-cancer treatments (SACT) was unknown. This study analysed the delivery of SACT for patients with solid malignancies during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 to inform future clinical decision-making. Methods: All patients receiving at least one SACT at Guy's comprehensive Cancer Centre during the COVID-19 outbreak for solid tumours (1st March- 31st May 2020) were compared to the same period in 2019. SARS-CoV2 infection was by positive RT-PCR test. Data collected: demographics, tumour type/stage and treatment (chemotherapy, immunotherapy (IO), biological-targeted (BT)). Results: 2125 patients received SACT in 2020, compared to 2450 in 2019 (13% decrease). Demographics were comparable with mean age of 62. 56% females in 2020 vs 54% in 2019, 85% vs 83% in the low socio-economic category, 63% vs 73% PS 0-1;30% vs 29% uro-gynaecological, 27% vs 24% breast and 20% vs 23% GI tumours. In 2020 compared to 2019, there was an increase in metastatic disease (71% vs 62%), decrease in CT (34% vs 42%), increase in IO (10% vs 6%), but similar rates of BT treatments (38% vs 37%). Treatment paradigms were similar in 2020 and 2019: neo/adjuvant (28% vs 29%), radical (4% vs 5%) and palliative (69% vs 67%). Earlier palliative treatments were prioritised in 2020 with significant increase in treatments in 1st-2nd line (72% vs 67%;p=0.02) and reduction in > 3rd line (12% vs 27%;p<0.05). 42 of 2125 patients (2%) developed SARS-CoV2 infections;38% GI, 26% breast with 69% on CT. Of 42 patients with COVID-19, 24 (57%) had severe infections and 6 (14%) resulted in COVID-related death. Conclusions: These data suggest that SACT does not put solid tumour patients at much a higher additional risk from COVID-19. Despite a 13% decline in treatment rates, radical and early palliative treatment were prioritised. There was a low frequency (2%) of SARS-CoV-2 infection;comparable to the 1.4% point prevalence rate in our cancer population. However, this was during national lockdown with limited COVID-19 testing.

686740,Role of children in the transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid scoping review,2020-06-21,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have been the most common cause of death worldwide for decades. Until recently the most affected patients were middle-aged and elderly, predominantly males, with more frequent ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) caused by obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). However, in the last two decades we have noticed an increased incidence of ischemia with non-obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA), which includes myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) and non-myocardial infarction syndromes, such as microvascular and vasospastic angina, conditions that have been particularly pronounced in women and young adults - the population we considered low-risky till than. Therefore, it has become apparent that for this group of patients conventional methods of assessing the risk of future cardiovascular (CV) events are no longer specific and sensitive enough. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is another disease, the incidence of which has been rising rapidly during last two decades, and predominantly affects elderly population. Although the etiology and pathophysiology of INOCA and HFpEF are complex and not fully understood, there is no doubt that the underlying cause of both conditions is endothelial dysfunction (ED) which further promotes the development of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD). Plasma biomarkers of ED, as well as natriuretic peptides (NPs), have been intensively investigated recently, and some of them have great potential for early detection and better assessment of CV risk in the future.

It presents a machine learning method for affect recognition applied to recordings taken during the COVID-19 winter lockdown in Scotland (UK). This method is exclusively based on acoustic features extracted from voice recordings collected through home and mobile devices (i.e. phones, tablets), thus providing insight into the feasibility of monitoring people's psychological wellbeing remotely, automatically and at scale. The proposed model is able to predict affect with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.4230 (using Random Forest) and 0.3354 (using Decision Trees) for arousal and valence respectively. Clinical relevance: In 2018/2019, 12% and 14% of Scottish adults reported depression and anxiety symptoms.

687103,COVID‐19 Pandemic in Assisted Living Communities: Results from Seven States,2020-09-21,"BACKGROUND: The current 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is hitting citizen’s life and health like never before, with its significant loss to human life and a huge economic toll. In this case, the fever clinics (FCs) were still preserved as one of the most effective control measures in China, but this work is based on experience and lacks scientific and effective guidance. Here, we use travel time to link facilities and populations at risk of COVID-19 and identify the dynamic allocation of patients’ medical needs, and then propose the optimized allocation scheme of FCs. METHODS: We selected Shenzhen, China, to collect geospatial resources of epidemic communities (ECs) and FCs to determine the ECs’ cumulative opportunities of visiting FCs, as well as evaluate the rationality of medical resources in current ECs. Also, we use the Location Set Covering Problem (LSCP) model to optimize the allocation of FCs and evaluate efficiency. RESULTS: Firstly, we divide the current ECs into 3 groups based on travel time and cumulative opportunities of visiting FCs within 30 min: Low-need communities (22.06%), medium-need communities (59.8%), and high-need communities (18.14%) with 0,1–2 and no less than 3 opportunities of visiting FCs. Besides, our work proposes two allocation schemes of fever clinics through the LSCP model. Among which, selecting secondary and above hospitals as an alternative in Scheme 1, will increase the coverage rate of hospitals in medium-need and high-need communities from 59.8% to 80.88%. In Scheme 2, selecting primary and above hospitals as an alternative will increase the coverage rate of hospitals in medium-need and high-need communities to 85.29%, with the average travel time reducing from 22.42 min to 17.94 min. CONCLUSIONS: The optimized allocation scheme can achieve two objectives: a. equal access to medical services for different types of communities has improved while reducing the overutilization of high-quality medical resources. b. the travel time for medical treatment in the community has reduced, thus improving medical accessibility. On this basis, during the early screening in prevention and control of the outbreak, the specific suggestions for implementation in developing and less developed countries are made.

In this multicenter cohort study, 166 COVID‐19 patients with cancer were compared with 498 non‐cancer COVID‐19 patients and 498 non‐COVID cancer patients. The 1‐year all‐cause mortality and hospital mortality rates in Cancer COVID‐19 Cohort (30% and 20%) were significantly higher than those in COVID‐19 Cohort (9% and 8%, both P < .001) and Cancer Cohort (16% and 2%, both P < 0.001). The 12‐month all‐cause post‐discharge mortality rate in survival discharged Cancer COVID‐19 Cohort (8%) was higher than that in COVID‐19 Cohort (0.4%, P < .001) but similar to that in Cancer Cohort (15%, P = .084). The incidence of sequelae in Cancer COVID‐19 Cohort (23%, 26/114) is similar to that in COVID‐19 Cohort (30%, 130/432, P = .13). The 1‐year all‐cause mortality was high among patients with hematologic malignancies (59%), followed by those who have nasopharyngeal, brain, and skin tumors (45%), digestive system neoplasm (43%), and lung cancers (32%). The rate was moderate among patients with genitourinary (14%), female genital (13%), breast (11%), and thyroid tumors (0). COVID‐19 patients with cancer showed a high rate of in‐hospital mortality and 1‐year all‐cause mortality, but the 12‐month all‐cause post‐discharge mortality rate in survival discharged cancer COVID‐19 patients was similar to that in Cancer Cohort. Comparing to COVID‐19 Cohort, risk stratification showed that hematologic, nasopharyngeal, brain, digestive system, and lung tumors were high risk (44% vs 9%, P < 0.001), while genitourinary, female genital, breast, and thyroid tumors had moderate risk (10% vs 9%, P = .85) in COVID‐19 Cancer Cohort. Different tumor subtypes had different effects on COVID‐19. But if cancer patients with COVID‐19 manage to survive their COVID‐19 infections, then long‐term mortality appears to be similar to the cancer patients without COVID‐19, and their long‐term clinical sequelae were similar to the COVID‐19 patients without cancer.","Chai, Chen; Feng, Xiaojun; Lu, Meixia; Li, Shoupeng; Chen, Kui; Wang, Hongxiang; Wang, Wendan; Tang, Zhaoming; Cheng, Gang; Wu, Xiaoxiong; Li, Yunfeng; Wen, Yuying; Da, Banghong; Fan, Hong; Wang, Lei; Ai, Fen; Li, Wei; Peng, Cao; Zhang, Hongrong; Wen, Shuang; Zhang, Jinnong; Weng, Yuxiong; Tang, Zehai",IUBMB Life,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34318585/; https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.2536,470

Thus, only non-deferrable consultations were performed in the outbreak's acute phase. Along with the re-opening of elective clinical services and the impending second wave of the outbreak, a reorganization is necessary to minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission (De Bernardi et al., 2020 [1]). METHODS: This video shows how to safely conduct an outpatient Otorhinolaryngological consultation, focusing on complete ear, nose and throat examination, according to evidences from the published literature and Otolaryngological societies guidelines [2,3]. RESULTS: After telephonic screening, patients reporting Covid-19 symptoms or close contact with a Covid-19 case within the last 14 days are referred to telehealth services (De Bernardi et al., 2020 [[1], [2], [3]]). To avoid crowding, the patient is admitted alone, after body temperature control, except for underage or disabled people (De Bernardi et al., 2020 [1]). The waiting room assessment must guarantee a social distance of 6 ft. De Bernardi et al. (2020) [[1], [2], [3]] The consultation room is reorganized into two separate areas: 1) a clean desk area, where an assistant wearing a surgical mask and gloves, handles the patient's documentation and writes the medical report, keeping proper distance from the patient, and 2) a separate consultation area, where the examiner, equipped with proper personal protective equipment (Coden et al., 2020 [3,4]), carries out the medical interview and physical examination. Endoscopic-assisted ear, nose and throat inspection using a dedicated monitor allows the examiner to maintain an adequate distance from the patient throughout the procedure while providing an optimal view [3]. Recent evidence shows that nasal endoscopy does not increase droplet production compared to traditional otolaryngological examination (Murr et al., 2020 [5]). When necessary, nasal topic decongestion and anesthesia must be performed using cottonoids rather than sprays [3]. The patient keeps the nose and mouth covered throughout the consultation, lowering the surgical mask on the mouth for nasal endoscopy and removing it only for oropharyngoscopy. After the consultation, the doffing procedure must be carried out carefully to avoid contamination (Coden et al., 2020 [4]). All the equipment and surfaces must undergo high-level disinfection with 70% alcohol or 0.1% bleach solutions [3]. Proper room ventilation must precede the next consultation [3]. CONCLUSIONS: The hints provided in this video are useful to ensure both patient and examiner safety during Otolaryngological outpatient consultations and to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Arosio, Alberto Daniele; Russo, Federico; Coden, Elisa; Castelnuovo, Paolo; Volpi, Luca; Karligkiotis, Apostolos",Am J Otolaryngol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102873; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196070920305676?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196070920305676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33431196/,470
687897,Congenital Bleeding Disorders amid the COVID-19 pandemic: open questions and recommendations,2020-09-07,"We examined whether the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) and influenza in Serbia, a Southeast European country with a low TB incidence rate and a mandatory BCG vaccination at birth. The first case of COVID-19 was registered on March 6, 2020. Despite the need for a sudden adaptation of the health care system, routines of mycobacterial laboratories have never stopped. In 2020, the number of newly diagnosed TB patients was significantly lower than expected (p = 0.04), but the number of patients with influenza increased when compared to 2019. Although many patients with influenza A H1N1 were observed before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the increment of cases could also be a consequence of cases of influenza with COVID-like symptoms detected thereafter. It may also be attributed to misclassification of clinical cases that were negative for SARS-CoV-2 and reported as influenza. Difficulties to seek medical attention because of the COVID-19 pandemic and possible underreporting are considered as reasons for the decline in the incidence rate of TB. On the other hand, individual and social measures to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 such as wearing face masks, social distancing, lockdown, which were strictly applied to COVID-19 patients, health care staffs and most of the population, could have hindered TB infections more than the two viral diseases, which appear to be more contagious. The increased motivation of the population to protect their health during the COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity for their effective education. This is crucial in further combating TB as a preventable disease.","Pavlovic, Jovana Milan; Pesut, Dragica Petar; Stosic, Maja Borivoje",Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34190955/; https://doi.org/10.1590/s1678-9946202163053,470

688232,Emotion Regulation Strategies Predict PTSS During the COVID-19 Pandemic in an American Indian Population,2021-02-09,"Publisher Summary Coronavirus and coronavirus-like infections are described in swine, cattle, horses, cats, dogs, rats, birds, bats, rabbits, ferrets, mink, and various wildlife species, although many coronavirus infections are subclinical or asymptomatic. In humans, coronaviruses are included in the spectrum of viruses that cause the common cold and, recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is a zoonosis. This chapter explains that the family Coronaviridae is included with the families Arteriviridae and Roniviridae in the order nidovirales; viruses in these three families share a distinctive replication strategy. The genus Coronavirus contains a substantial number of pathogens of mammals and birds that individually cause a remarkable variety of diseases, including pneumonia, reproductive disease, enteritis, polyserositis, sialodacryoadenitis, hepatitis, encephalomyelitis, nephritis, and various other disorders. The genus Coronavirus can be subdivided into at least three cluster groups on the basis of genetic and serologic properties, with subgroups in two of these. Group 1a includes transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine, porcine respiratory coronavirus, canine coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus, ferret and mink coronaviruses, and spotted hyena coronavirus. Group 1b includes certain human coronaviruses, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and bat coronavirus. Group 2a includes mouse hepatitis virus, bovine coronavirus, sialodacryoadenitis virus of rats, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, canine respiratory coronavirus, and other human coronaviruses. Group 2b includes human SARS coronavirus and civet cat, raccoon dog, and horseshoe bat coronaviruses.

A protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021-05-04,"This is the first study focused on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in different freshwater environments of an urban setting. Groundwater and surface water reservoirs for drinking water as well as water from receiving rivers of Monterrey Metropolitan Area were sampled repeatedly during a peak phase between October 2020 and January 2021, and the virus RNA was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Forty-four percent of groundwater samples demonstrated detectable virus loads between 2.9 and 5.6 copies/ml. A significant correlation with sucralose concentration in groundwater reaffirmed the hypothesis of leaching and infiltration of effluents from surface and/or failing sewage pipes, and emphases the importance of water disinfection. Thirteen percent of surface water dam samples tested positive, with values varying between 3.3 and 3.8 copies/ml. Finally, 21% of river samples marked positive for viral RNA, with concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 7.0 copies/ml. Raw wastewater samples taken in the same period show viral loads of up to 3535 copies/ml, demonstrating a dilution effect and/or efficiency of wastewater facilities. Variations of viral loads over time and at sub-metropolitan level in groundwater and surface water in general reflects the reported variation of infections for Monterrey.","Mahlknecht, J.; Alonso-Padilla, D.; Ramos, E.; Reyes, L.

688501,Association Between Current Physical Activity and Current Perceived Anxiety and Mood in the Initial Phase of COVID-19 Confinement,2020-07-23,"AIM: The isolating public health measures mandated during the COVID‐19 pandemic had complex influences on the lives and body image of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer individuals (LGBTQ+) in Canada. The aim of this study was to explore the impact the COVID‐19 pandemic had on body image for LGBTQ+ Canadians. METHODS: The qualitative research process was guided by queer theory and poststructuralism and consisted of an online survey with open‐ended questions and semi‐structured virtual interviews. A total of 70 self‐identifying LGBTQ+ individuals completed the survey, and eight individuals partook in the interviews. Responses were analysed using Foucauldian discourse analysis. RESULTS: Four major discursive considerations were found to shape participants' experiences, including, (a) time for reflection, (b) time away from social surveillance, (c) time to work on oneself, and (d) time to (dis)connect. Woven through these considerations were social discourses of hetero‐cis‐normativity, healthism, and resistance. DISCUSSION: The COVID‐19 pandemic was a ‘queer time’ for LGBTQ+ people. Competing social discourses created complex and often contradictory meanings of bodies and body image. COVID‐19‐related self‐isolation was for some participants a reprieve from constant body monitoring while for others it was a time of continued pressure to embody body ideals. Participants suggested that nutritional messages during such times be ones of compassion and non‐judgement of bodies.","Quathamer, Natalie (Nat); Joy, Phillip",Nutr Diet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34337841/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1747-0080.12699,470
688548,A Rise of Public Interest in Aesthetic Facial Surgery Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Google Trends Analysis,2021-03-29,"We present a topic modelling and data visualization methodology to examine gender-based disparities in news articles by topic. Existing research in topic modelling is largely focused on the text mining of closed corpora, i.e., those that include a fixed collection of composite texts. We showcase a methodology to discover topics via Latent Dirichlet Allocation, which can reliably produce human-interpretable topics over an open news corpus that continually grows with time. Our system generates topics, or distributions of keywords, for news articles on a monthly basis, to consistently detect key events and trends aligned with events in the real world. Findings from 2 years worth of news articles in mainstream English-language Canadian media indicate that certain topics feature either women or men more prominently and exhibit different types of language. Perhaps unsurprisingly, topics such as lifestyle, entertainment, and healthcare tend to be prominent in articles that quote more women than men. Topics such as sports, politics, and business are characteristic of articles that quote more men than women. The data shows a self-reinforcing gendered division of duties and representation in society. Quoting female sources more frequently in a caregiving role and quoting male sources more frequently in political and business roles enshrines women’s status as caregivers and men’s status as leaders and breadwinners. Our results can help journalists and policy makers better understand the unequal gender representation of those quoted in the news and facilitate news organizations’ efforts to achieve gender parity in their sources. The proposed methodology is robust, reproducible, and scalable to very large corpora, and can be used for similar studies involving unsupervised topic modelling and language analyses.","Rao, Prashanth; Taboada, Maite",Front Artif Intell,https://doi.org/10.3389/frai.2021.664737; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34222857/,470

Virtual simulation emerged as a key component of providing clinical experiences to nursing students. PROBLEM: Commercial virtual simulation products can be costly, and it is difficult to ensure the content meets student needs. In addition, there is a potential for cheating as answers are available online. METHODS: Faculty recorded 16 different scenarios in pre-determined segments, including patient report, assessment, provider communication, and conclusion. During the clinical experience, the students watched the videos and participated in faculty-led discussion. At the conclusion of the activity, students completed a reflection assignment providing qualitative data for review. RESULTS: Student feedback was positive. Themes identified in the comments include critical thinking, variety of scenarios, observer role, debriefing, and overall quality of experience.

689106,Major Stressors and Coping Strategies of Internal Migrant Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Exploration,2021-05-20,"Almost a year after the COVID-19 pandemic had begun, The United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil became the epicenter of new lineages, the Variant of Concern (VOCs), B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1, respectively. These VOCs are increasingly associated with enhanced transmissibility, immunity evasion, and mortality. The previous most prevalent lineages in the state of Rio Grande do South (Brazil), B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 were rapidly replaced by P.1 and P.2, two B.1.1.28-derived lineages harboring the E484K mutation. To perform a genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 samples from COVID-19 patients from the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil), in this second pandemic wave, we sequenced viral samples from patients of this region to: (i) identify the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the region, the state and bordering countries/states, (ii) characterize the mutation spectra, and (iii) hypothesize possible viral dispersal routes by using phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches. As results, we not only confirmed that 96.4% of the samples belonged to the P.1 lineage but also that approximately 20% of which could be assigned as the newer P.1.2 (a P.1 derived new sublineage harboring new signature substitutions recently described and present in other Brazilian states and foreign countries). Moreover, P.1 sequences from this study were allocated in several distinct branches (four clades and five clusters) of the P.1 phylogeny, suggesting multiple introductions of P.1 in Rio Grande do Sul still in 2020 and placing this state as a potential core of diffusion and emergence of P.1-derived clades. It is still uncertain if the emergence of P.1.2 and other P.1 clades are related to further virological, clinical, or epidemiological consequences. However, the clear signs of viral molecular diversification from recently introduced P.1 warrant further genomic surveillance.","Franceschi, V. B.; Caldana, G.

689271,The Unpreparedness of the Healthcare System for the Management of COVID-19 Pandemic Leading to the Mistreatment of the Elderly: A Newly Emerging Moral Dilemma,2020-06-06,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic health condition exacerbated by negative emotional stress experiences. In the current study, we examined whether the outbreak of the COVID‐19 pandemic coincided with an increase in stress experiences and accordingly an aggravation of disease activity in IBD patients. Sixty‐three IBD patients (30 Crohn's disease or CD, 33 ulcerative colitis) completed an online survey during the COVID‐19‐related lockdown, assessing clinical disease activity, disease‐related quality of life, presence of functional gastrointestinal symptoms, social isolation and stress experiences. Scores were then compared to pre‐lockdown baseline screening. The pandemic yielded a significant baseline‐to‐lockdown increase in emotional stress and social isolation. Stress increments, particularly those occasioned by interpersonal tension and excessive interpersonal proximity, were associated with a worsening of functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Exacerbations of loneliness coincided with an escalation of CD activity, functional gastrointestinal symptoms and a decline in subjective health. Lastly, COVID‐19 anxiety was significantly related to CD symptom severity and social dysfunction. The findings show that shifts in IBD expression are closely linked to changes in emotional stress experiences and interpersonal relatedness. As such, they contribute to a better understanding of inter‐individual differences in IBD progression and provide leads for therapeutic interventions.","Nass, Boukje Yentl Sundari; Dibbets, Pauline; Markus, C.

In March 2020 New York City became the USA epicenter for the pandemic. On March 27, 2020 a Malayan tiger (Panthera tigris jacksoni) at the Bronx Zoo in New York City developed a cough and wheezing with subsequent inappetence. Over the next week, an additional Malayan tiger and two Amur tigers (P. t. altaica) in the same building and three lions (Panthera leo krugeri) in a separate building also became ill. The index case was immobilized, and physical examination and bloodwork results were unremarkable. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonography revealed peribronchial cuffing with bronchiectasis, and mild lung consolidation with alveolar-interstitial syndrome, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified by real-time, reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) on oropharyngeal and nasal swabs and tracheal wash fluid. Cytologic examination of tracheal wash fluid revealed necrosis, and viral RNA was detected in necrotic cells by in situ hybridization, confirming virus-associated tissue damage. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the tracheal wash fluid of the index case, as well as the feces from one Amur tiger and one lion. Fecal viral RNA shedding was confirmed in all seven clinical cases and an asymptomatic Amur tiger. Respiratory signs abated within 1-5 days for most animals, though persisted intermittently for 16 days in the index case. Fecal RNA shedding persisted for as long as 35 days beyond cessation of respiratory signs. This case series describes the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of tigers and lions infected with SARS-CoV-2, and describes the duration of viral RNA fecal shedding in these cases. This report documents the first known natural transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to animals in the USA, and is the first report of SARS-CoV-2 in non-domestic felids.","Bartlett, Susan L.; Diel, Diego G; Wang, Leyi; Zec, Stephanie; Laverack, Melissa; Martins, Mathias; Caserta, Leonardo Cardia; Killian, Mary Lea; Terio, Karen; Olmstead, Colleen; Delaney, Martha A.; Stokol, Tracy; IvanÄiÄ, Marina; Jenkins-Moore, Melinda; Ingerman, Karen; Teegan, Taryn; McCann, Colleen; Thomas, Patrick; McAloose, Denise; Sykes, John M.; Calle, Paul P.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.14.250928,470

Recently a combinatorial product with toltrazuril plus iron has been developed for parenteral application. In this study we compared the efficacy of the injectable product with the oral suspension against experimentally induced piglet cystoisosporosis. METHODS: In a randomised controlled study, three groups of piglets (n = 10–13) were treated either with a fixed dose of 45 mg toltrazuril + 200 mg gleptoferron i.m. per piglet (Forceris®) on the second day of life (study day 2; SD 2) or with 20 mg toltrazuril/kg body weight as an oral suspension (Baycox® 5%) on SD 4 or left untreated (Control group). The Baycox® and the Control group received 200 mg of iron dextran/piglet on SD 2. All piglets were infected with 1000 sporulated C. suis oocysts on SD 3. Faecal samples were taken daily from SD 7 to SD 20 to determine faecal consistency, oocyst shedding and other diarrhoeal pathogens. Body weight was recorded on SD 1 and then weekly until SD 29. Animals were observed daily for general health and after treatment for possible adverse events. RESULTS: In the Control group all animals shed oocysts for 3.1 days on average and all animals showed diarrhoea for an average of five days. Excretion peaked on SD 9 (max. 48,618 oocysts per gram of faeces). Treatment with Forceris® completely suppressed oocyst excretion. In the Baycox® group, low levels of excretion could be detected. Diarrhoea was reduced to single piglets in the treated groups. Body weight development was reduced in the Control group compared to the treated groups. Enteropathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens) could be detected. All parameters related to oocyst excretion, faecal consistency and weight gain were significantly improved in the treated groups compared to the Control group without significant differences between the treated groups. Both products were safe to use. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with both the injectable (Forceris®) and the oral (Baycox®) formulation of toltrazuril in the prepatent period were safe and highly effective against experimental infection with C. suis in newborn piglets.","Joachim, Anja; Shrestha, Aruna; Freudenschuss, Barbara; Palmieri, Nicola; Hinney, Barbara; Karembe, Hamadi; Sperling, Daniel",Parasit Vectors,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2797-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29580269/,470
