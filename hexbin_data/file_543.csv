However, the expression of Btk in T cells and its role in T-cell function remain largely unknown. Here, we unexpectedly found high expression and activation of BTK in T cells. Deficiencies in BTK resulted in the impaired activation and proliferation of autoreactive T cells and ameliorated bone marrow failure (BMF) in aplastic anemia. Mechanistically, BTK is activated after TCR engagement and then phosphorylates PLCγ1, thus promoting T-cell activation. Treatment with acalabrutinib, a selective BTK inhibitor, decreased T-cell proliferation and ameliorated BMF in mice with aplastic anemia. Our results demonstrate an unexpected role of BTK in optimal T-cell activation and in the pathogenesis of autoimmune aplastic anemia, providing insights into the molecular regulation of T-cell activation and the pathogenesis of T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease.","Xia, Simo; Liu, Xiang; Cao, Xuetao; Xu, Sheng",Cell Mol Immunol,543,1

Besides classical methods, several techniques such as the naive credal classifier (for categorical data) and imprecise logistic regression (for continuous data) have been proposed to handle sparse data. However, a convincing approach to the classification problem in high dimensional problems (i.e., when the number of attributes is larger than the number of observations) is yet to be explored in the context of imprecise probability. In this article, we propose a sensitivity analysis based on penalised logistic regression scheme that works as binary classifier for high dimensional cases. We use an approach based on a set of likelihood functions (i.e. an imprecise likelihood, if you like), that assigns a set of weights to the attributes, to ensure a robust selection of the important attributes, whilst training the model at the same time, all in one fell swoop. We do a sensitivity analysis on the weights of the penalty term resulting in a set of sparse constraints which helps to identify imprecision in the dataset.","Basu, Tathagata; Troffaes, Matthias C.

Although automated machine learning (AutoML) has proved to be successful dealing with the model selection problem in other applications areas, only a few papers have explored the performance of general-purpose AutoML methods, purely based on optimisation, when tackling TF. In this paper, we provide a thorough exploration of the benefits of Auto-sklearn for TF, as a general-purpose AutoML method that follows a hybrid search strategy combining optimisation with meta-learning and ensemble learning. Particularly, we focus on how well Auto-sklearn is able to recommend competitive machine learning pipelines to forecast traffic, modelled as a TF multi-class imbalanced classification problem, along different time horizons at two spatial scales (point and road segment) and two environments (freeway and urban). Concretely, we test the following scenarios: I) a hybrid search strategy with the three components (optimisation, meta-learning, ensemble learning), II) a strategy based on meta-learning and ensemble learning, and III) a strategy based on the estimation of the best performing pipeline from those suggested by the meta-learning. Experimental results show that the meta-learning component of Auto-sklearn does not work properly on TF problems, and on the other hand, that the optimisation does not contribute too much to the final performance of predictions.","Angarita-Zapata, Juan S.; Masegosa, Antonio D.; Triguero, Isaac",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,543,33

Artificial intelligence has the potential to reduce their burden by automatically addressing the routine part of this interaction, which will free them up to focus on more important aspects of learning. We explore the use of automated question answering methods to power virtual TAs in online course discussion forums, which are heavily relied on during the COVID-19 pandemic as classes transition online. First, we focus on answering frequent and repetitive logistical questions and adopt a question answering framework that consists of two steps: retrieving relevant documents from a repository and extracting answers from retrieved documents. The document repository consists of course materials that contain information on course logistics, e.g., the syllabus, lecture slides, course emails, and prior discussion forum posts. This question answering framework can help virtual TAs decide whether a question is answerable and how to answer it. Second, we analyze the timing of student posts in discussion threads and develop a classifier to predict the timing of follow-up posts. This classifier can help virtual TAs decide whether to respond to a question and when to do so. We conduct experiments on data collected from an introductory physics course and discuss both the utility and limitations of our approach .","Zylich, Brian; Viola, Adam; Toggerson, Brokk; Al-Hariri, Lara; Lan, Andrew",Artificial Intelligence in Education,543,1

In practice, beyond being a property of AIEd systems alone, adaptivity is often jointly enacted by AI systems and human facilitators (e.g., teachers or peers). Despite much recent research activity, theoretical and conceptual guidance for the design of such human–AI systems remains limited. In this paper we explore how adaptivity may be shared across AIEd systems and the various human stakeholders who work with them. Based on a comparison of prior frameworks, which tend to examine adaptivity in AIEd systems or human coaches separately, we first synthesize a set of dimensions general enough to capture human–AI hybrid adaptivity. Using these dimensions, we then present a conceptual framework to map distinct ways in which humans and AIEd systems can augment each other’s abilities. Through examples, we illustrate how this framework can be used to characterize prior work and envision new possibilities for human–AI hybrid approaches in education.","Holstein, Kenneth; Aleven, Vincent; Rummel, Nikol",Artificial Intelligence in Education,543,1

Multimodal affect detection combining sensor-based and sensor-free approaches has shown significant promise in both laboratory and classroom settings. However, important questions remain regarding which data channels are most predictive and how they should be combined. In this paper, we investigate a multimodal affect detection framework that integrates motion tracking-based posture data and interaction-based trace data to recognize the affective states of students engaged with a game-based learning environment for emergency medical training. We compare several machine learning-based affective models using competing feature-level and decision-level multimodal data fusion approaches. Results indicate that multimodal affect detectors induced using joint feature representations from posture-based and interaction-based data channels yield improved accuracy relative to unimodal models across several learner-centered affective states. These findings point toward implications for the design of multimodal affect-responsive learning environments that support learning and engagement.","Henderson, Nathan; Rowe, Jonathan; Paquette, Luc; Baker, Ryan S.; Lester, James",Artificial Intelligence in Education,543,1

RECENT FINDINGS: While traditional work in trustworthy robotics has focused on studying the antecedents and consequences of trust in robots, recent work has gravitated towards the development of strategies for robots to actively gain, calibrate, and maintain the human user’s trust. Among these works, there is emphasis on endowing robotic agents with reasoning capabilities (e.g., via probabilistic modeling). SUMMARY: The state-of-the-art in trust research provides roboticists with a large trove of tools to develop trustworthy robots. However, challenges remain when it comes to trust in real-world human-robot interaction (HRI) settings: there exist outstanding issues in trust measurement, guarantees on robot behavior (e.g., with respect to user privacy), and handling rich multidimensional data. We examine how recent advances in psychometrics, trustworthy systems, robot-ethics, and deep learning can provide resolution to each of these issues. In conclusion, we are of the opinion that these methodological advances could pave the way for the creation of truly autonomous, trustworthy social robots.","Kok, Bing Cai; Soh, Harold",Curr Robot Rep,543,1

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can bring additional benefits to these patients but has few adverse effects. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Jia Wei Bushen Yiqi (JWBY) formulas in patients who suffer from COPD exacerbations and to investigate whether the short-term (5-days) systemic glucocorticoid therapy is non-inferior to the long-term (9-day) regime. METHODS: In this multi-center, randomized, double-blinded trial, eligible inpatients with COPD exacerbation are randomly assigned to four groups (A, B, C, and D). Group A will receive placebo plus 5-day prednisone, group B will receive placebo plus 9-day prednisone, group C will receive JWBY formulas plus 5-day prednisone, and group D will receive JWBY formulas plus 9-day prednisone. The primary outcomes are the time interval to the patient’s next exacerbation during a 180-day following up and the COPD assessment test (CAT) during treatment. Secondary outcomes include lung function, TCM syndrome assessment, laboratory tests, and safety. The changes of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenaline axis (HPA axis) and inflammatory cytokine will be measured as well. DISCUSSION: By demonstrating the advantages of utilizing TCM and an appropriate duration of systemic glucocorticoids, this effectiveness comparison trial will provide new references to physicians on how to improve the management of COPD exacerbation. The results of HPA axis and inflammation cytokine measurements will shed light on the molecular mechanisms and entail further mechanism studies.

Continual refinement of animal toxicity and carcinogenesis studies, however, can be an effective means of reducing the numbers of animals used and conserving time and resources without compromising scientific quality. We must continue to strive to find species and strains that can metabolize chemicals similar to humans, are small enough to be housed in large numbers, and have low prevalence of spontaneous lesions with sufficient life span to express the toxic and carcinogenic potential of chemicals. Adequate care of animals with control of variables such as light, temperature, diet, bedding, diseases, and genetic characters of laboratory animals will decrease the variability. Humane considerations and euthanasia of animals with large masses and other conditions interfering with eating and drinking, major injuries and ulcers related to husbandry and treatment, and diseases indicating pain and suffering will help not only to alleviate further pain and distress but also to facilitate collection of tissues without secondary complications for detection of chemical treatment-related lesions. Limiting the duration of studies to decrease the variability due to age-associated changes will also refine long-term studies. Other considerations for refinement of carcinogenesis studies include selection of the most sensitive sex of one or more species for evaluation of selected chemicals in a class where toxic and carcinogenic potential of other representative chemicals are known. Genetically engineered animal models with known oncogenes may reduce the duration and increase the sensitivity of carcinogenesis studies with a reduction in the use of animals.","RAO, GHANTA N.; HUFF, JAMES",Fundam Appl Toxicol,543,22

A study with multiple exposure groups and large group sizes was performed to establish whether exposure to 60-Hz electric fields would result in reproductive and developmental toxicity. A response model was developed from previous results and tested in groups of rats exposed to electric fields at various field strengths. Female rats were mated, and sperm-positive animals randomly distributed among four groups: sham-exposed or exposed to 10, 65, or 130 kV/m, 60-Hz vertical electric fields. Animals were exposed for 19 hr/day throughout the experiment. During gestation, exposure to the higher field strengths resulted in slightly depressed weight gains of dams. Offspring were born in the field and remained with their dams through the suckling period. Numbers of pups per litter and pup mortality did not differ among the exposure groups. Dams exposed at 65 kV/m lost slightly more weight through the lactation period than the control group. Male pups exposed to higher field strengths gained slightly less weight from 4 to 21 days of age than did sham-exposed animals. At weaning, two F(1) females per litter (randomly selected) continued on the same exposure regimen were mated at 11 weeks of age to unexposed males, and euthanized at 20 days of gestation. Uterine contents were evaluated, and all live fetuses were weighed and examined for external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. Fertility and gestational weight gain of F(1) females were not affected by exposure, nor was prenatal viability or fetal body weight. No significant increase in the incidence of litters with malformations was observed. Although no developmental toxicity was detected, exposures produced physical changes in the dams, evidenced as a rust-colored deposit on the muzzle and ears (chromodac-ryorrhea) that increased in incidence and severity at 65 and 130 kV/m. Incidence of chromodac-ryorrhea was not significantly different between sham-exposed rats and those exposed at 10 kV/m.","ROMMEREIM, D. N.; ROMMEREIM, R. L.; SIKOV, M. R.; BUSCHBOM, R.

Historically these have been prose documents, with all the problems that entails, but research over the last ten years has developed rigorous and executable-as-test-oracle specifications of mainstream architecture instruction sets and “user-mode” concurrency, clarifying architectures and bringing them into the scope of programming-language semantics and verification. However, the system semantics, of instruction-fetch and cache maintenance, exceptions and interrupts, and address translation, remains obscure, leaving us without a solid foundation for verification of security-critical systems software. In this paper we establish a robust model for one aspect of system semantics: instruction fetch and cache maintenance for ARMv8-A. Systems code relies on executing instructions that were written by data writes, e.g. in program loading, dynamic linking, JIT compilation, debugging, and OS configuration, but hardware implementations are often highly optimised, e.g. with instruction caches, linefill buffers, out-of-order fetching, branch prediction, and instruction prefetching, which can affect programmer-observable behaviour. It is essential, both for programming and verification, to abstract from such microarchitectural details as much as possible, but no more. We explore the key architecture design questions with a series of examples, discussed in detail with senior Arm staff; capture the architectural intent in operational and axiomatic semantic models, extending previous work on “user-mode” concurrency; make these models executable as test oracles for small examples; and experimentally validate them against hardware behaviour (finding a bug in one hardware device). We thereby bring these subtle issues into the mathematical domain, clarifying the architecture and enabling future work on system software verification.","Simner, Ben; Flur, Shaked; Pulte, Christopher; Armstrong, Alasdair; Pichon-Pharabod, Jean; Maranget, Luc; Sewell, Peter",Programming Languages and Systems,543,16

Mints have been used since ancient Babylon, but it was in Classical Antiquity that their medical uses flourished, with major contributions from Pliny the Elder. In the Middle Ages, the increased knowledge surrounding mints came from Byzantine physicians, while, in the Modern Age, technological developments allowed the production of mint-based products, such as extracts and essential oils, which have become part of elaborate galenic formulas employed by an increasing number of physicians, and have also stimulated both scientific and artistic interests alike. In present-day medicine, several mints and mint-based products are being researched as potential therapeutic alternatives for many diseases, while also being vastly employed in food and cosmetic industries. ABSTRACT: Mints have been among the most widely used herbs for medicinal purposes since ancient civilizations. They are still presently used for numerous purposes, including non-medicinal, which makes them economically relevant herbs. Information regarding the medical and scientific uses given to mints throughout history are vastly scattered and/or incomplete. The aim of this paper is to provide an extensive descriptive overview of the medical uses given to these herbs, highlighting both the authors in medical culture responsible for their dissemination, as well as their major galenic formulations. Databases on medical science, reference textbooks on medical history, botanics (aromatic herbs), and pharmacognosy were consulted. The use of mints remotes to Classical Antiquity, with major contributions from Pliny the Elder. In the Middle Ages, the increased knowledge surrounding mints came from Byzantine physicians, while, in the Modern Age, technological developments allowed the production of mint-based products which have become part of elaborate galenic formulas employed by an increasing number of physicians, as well as have also stimulated both scientific and artistic interests alike. In present-day medicine, several mints and mint-based products are being researched as potential therapeutic alternatives for many diseases, while also being vastly employed in food and cosmetic industries.","Silva, Henrique",Biology (Basel),543,1

There is neither a treatment nor a vaccine available, and the only method to control its spread is by extensive culling of pigs. So far, classical vaccine development approaches have not yielded sufficiently good results in terms of concomitant safety and efficacy. Nowadays, thanks to advances in genomic and proteomic techniques, a reverse vaccinology strategy can be explored to design alternative vaccine formulations. In this study, ASFV protein sequences were analyzed using an in-house pipeline based on publicly available immunoinformatic tools to identify epitopes of interest for a prospective vaccine ensemble. These included experimentally validated sequences from the Immune Epitope Database, as well as de novo predicted sequences. Experimentally validated and predicted epitopes were prioritized following a series of criteria that included evolutionary conservation, presence in the virulent and currently circulating variant Georgia 2007/1, and lack of identity to either the pig proteome or putative proteins from pig gut microbiota. Following this strategy, 29 B-cell, 14 CD4(+) T-cell and 6 CD8(+) T-cell epitopes were selected, which represent a starting point to investigating the protective capacity of ASFV epitope-based vaccines.","Ros-Lucas, Albert; Correa-Fiz, Florencia; Bosch-Camós, Laia; Rodriguez, Fernando; Alonso-Padilla, Julio",Pathogens,543,28

In this retrospective, single-centre, observational study, we present our eight-year experience of antifungal prophylaxis using intermittent high-dose liposomal Amphotericin B (L-AmB). All adults identified through our Antifungal Stewardship Programme as receiving L-AmB prophylaxis at 7.5 mg/kg once-weekly between February 2012 and January 2020 were included. Adverse reactions, including infusion reactions, electrolyte loss, and nephrotoxicity, were recorded. ‘Breakthrough’ invasive fungal infection (IFI) occurring within four weeks of L-AmB was classified using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria. Moreover, 114 courses of intermittent high-dose L-AmB prophylaxis administered to 92 unique patients were analysed. Hypokalaemia was the most common grade 3–4 adverse event, with 26 (23%) courses. Grade 3 nephrotoxicity occurred in 8 (7%) and reversed in all six patients surviving to 90 days. There were two (1.8%) episodes of breakthrough IFI, one ‘probable’ and one ‘possible’. In this study, the largest evaluation of intermittent high-dose L-AmB prophylaxis conducted to date, toxicity was manageable and reversible and breakthrough IFI was rare. L-AmB prophylaxis represents a viable alternative for patients with a contraindication to triazoles.","Youngs, Jonathan; Low, Jen Mae; Whitney, Laura; Logan, Clare; Chase, Janice; Yau, Ting; Klammer, Matthias; Koh, Mickey; Bicanic, Tihana",J Fungi (Basel),543,1

In the past, other Coronaviruses have also been found to cause human infection, but not as widespread as COVID-19. Since Coronavirus sequences constantly change due to mutation and recombination, it is important to understand the pattern of changes and likely path the virus can take in the future. In this study, we have used the Shewhart control chart to identify and analyze hypervariable (hotspots) and hypovariable (coldspots) regions of the virus. Our analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 has changed in a few regions of the genome. Analysis of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS sequences suggests that over time, mutations start accumulating in different regions and most likely SARS-CoV-2 may also follow a similar path.

Its defining autoantibody is specific for the water channel protein, aquaporin‐4 (AQP4), which primarily is localized at the end-feet of astrocytes. Histopathology studies of early NMO lesions demonstrated prominent activation of microglia, the resident immune sentinels of the central nervous system (CNS). Significant microglial reactivity is also observed in NMO animal models induced by introducing AQP4-IgG into the CNS. Here we review the potential roles for microglial activation in human NMO patients as well as different animal models of NMO. We will focus primarily on the molecular mechanisms underlying microglial function and microglia-astrocyte interaction in NMO pathogenesis. Understanding the role of microglia in NMO pathology may yield novel therapeutic approaches for this disease.","Chen, Tingjun; Bosco, Dale B.; Ying, Yanlu; Tian, Dai-Shi; Wu, Long-Jun",Front Immunol,543,12

Numerous computer-aided approaches have been devised for the early detection of hepatitis. In this study, we propose a method for the analysis and classification of cases of hepatitis-B virus ( HBV), hepatitis-C virus (HCV), and healthy subjects using Raman spectroscopy and a multiscale convolutional neural network (MSCNN). In particular, serum samples of HBV-infected patients (435 cases), HCV-infected patients (374 cases), and healthy persons (499 cases) are analyzed via Raman spectroscopy. The differences between Raman peaks in the measured serum spectra indicate specific biomolecular differences among the three classes. The dimensionality of the spectral data is reduced through principal component analysis. Subsequently, features are extracted, and then feature normalization is applied. Next, the extracted features are used to train different classifiers, namely MSCNN, a single-scale convolutional neural network, and other traditional classifiers. Among these classifiers, the MSCNN model achieved the best outcomes with a precision of 98.89%, sensitivity of 97.44%, specificity of 94.54%, and accuracy of 94.92%. Overall, the results demonstrate that Raman spectral analysis and MSCNN can be effectively utilized for rapid screening of hepatitis B and C cases.","Zhao, Y.; Tian, Sh.; Yu, L.; Zhang, Zh.; Zhang, W.",J Appl Spectrosc,543,1

In the Roman Catholic tradition, the council of Vatican II has defined worship in reference to the endogenous dimensions of the liturgy, with little awareness of outside factors. This paper examines worship in a Catholic parish, characterized by a dynamic Latino minority within a dominantly traditional Italian American population. The endogenous variables of ethnicity and clergy dominance are not recognized while the exogenous variables of national attendance decline, ineffective institutional faith transmission, religious individualism, consumerism, and secularism are ignored. This is so because the clergy defines its responsibility only in reference to the ritual part of the liturgy, not singing and devotions. More generally, the resistance to change can be explained in terms of an ideology of self-preservation, in the form of clerical professionalization and the privatization of worship.

We examined the association between multiple measures of food insecurity and frequent ED use in a random sample of ED patients. METHODS: We completed survey questionnaires with randomly sampled adult patients from an urban public hospital ED (n = 2,312). We assessed food insecurity using four questions from the United States Department of Agriculture Household Food Security Survey. The primary independent variable was any food insecurity, defined as an affirmative response to any of the four items. Frequent ED use was defined as self-report of ≥4 ED visits in the past year. We examined the relationship between patient food insecurity and frequent ED use using bivariate and multivariable analyses and examined possible mediation by anxiety/depression and overall health status. RESULTS: One-third (30.9%) of study participants reported frequent ED use, and half (50.8%) reported any food insecurity. Prevalence of food insecurity was higher among frequent vs. non-frequent ED users, 62.8% vs 45.4% (P <0.001). After controlling for potential confounders, food insecurity remained significantly associated with frequent ED use (adjusted odds ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval, 1.20–1.83). This observed association was partially attenuated when anxiety/depression and overall health status were added to models. CONCLUSION: The high observed prevalence of food insecurity suggests that efforts to improve care of ED patients should assess and address this need. Further research is needed to assess whether addressing food insecurity may play an important role in efforts to reduce frequent ED use for some patients.","Estrella, Alex; Scheidell, Joy; Khan, Maria; Castelblanco, Donna; Mijanovich, Tod; Lee, David C.; Gelberg, Lillian; Doran, Kelly M.",West J Emerg Med,543,5

One well-evidenced model encapsulating this is ‘hospital at home’, however limited research has examined staffs' views on its implementation, which may inform service development and increase job satisfaction. The aim within was to explore the staff perspective of implementing a ‘hospital at home’ model in a Scottish care setting which can inform service provision and ultimately increase job satisfaction. METHODS: The ‘Acute Care @ Home’ (AC@H) service had a multi-disciplinary team. Referrals were predominantly received from a geriatric hospital ward. Inclusion criteria were older adults with geriatric syndromes and who required care input for a duration between one to seven days. In-depth staff interviews (N = 13) were conducted and analysed thematically to understand barriers and facilitators to implementation. These were supplemented with questionnaires assessing constructs of interest including training, communication and overall satisfaction. RESULTS: Several themes urged from our study: inter-team and intra-team collaboration, service development and operation, and scaling considerations. High job satisfaction was reported (mean score 73%), particularly due to a perceived non-hierarchical team structure and inclusive management style. Staff attributed positive outcomes through better identifying patients' needs at home compared to in hospital. Continuity of care facilitated rapport building. Recruitment challenges restricted the acuity and volume of patients the team were able to care for. CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative methodology could be useful for future implementation of intermediate care resources for the future health and care system building.

56644,56644,56644,The future of private dentistry,14.197075,0.09898655,2021-08-09,"BACKGROUND: Some suspected criminal offenders in South Africa are required to undergo forensic psychiatry assessments before or during the trial, which can be delayed as a result of the shortage of psychiatrists and inpatient forensic psychiatry beds. In KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, only one hospital (Fort Napier Hospital [FNH]) is designated for the 30-day inpatient forensic psychiatry assessments and there is a long waiting list for suspected criminal offenders awaiting assessment. There is a need to find ways of alleviating the backlog in the waiting list, with the use of outpatient forensic assessments being a possible adjunctive method. AIM: To determine the demographic, clinical and forensic profile of suspected criminal offenders referred for outpatient preliminary assessment to Ngwelezana Hospital, and identify the profile of those who most likely require referral to FNH for a 30-day inpatient assessment. SETTING: The study was conducted at Ngwelezana Tertiary Hospital, in KZN, South Africa. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 207 suspected criminal offenders referred for outpatient forensic assessment from January 2009 to June 2015. RESULTS: The majority of the participants were males (94.2%), with a diagnosis of substance use disorder (28.2%), intellectual disability (23.4%) or psychotic disorders (21.8%). Forty three per cent were charged with sexual crimes and 10.7% with murder. Fifty seven per cent were recommended for referral to FNH for a 30-day inpatient forensic assessment, whilst 43% were not recommended for referral. Those recommended for inpatient assessment were significantly more likely to have a lower level of education (p = 0.02), to be on a disability grant (p < 0.01), and to have been diagnosed with intellectual disability (p < 0.01), than those not recommended for referral. CONCLUSION: Identifying the characteristics of suspected criminal offenders who are most likely to be recommended for referral to FNH will potentially reduce the number of unnecessary referrals.","Mngadi, Sithembisile; Tomita, Andrew; Khanyile, Vusi; Chiliza, Bonginkosi",S Afr J Psychiatr,543,1

Aim of this study was to compare NIV-NAVA with noninvasive pressure support (NIV-PS) in children with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF), in a single-center before-after study. A cohort of thirty-four NIV-PS patients (before group) admitted to our PICU within the 2 years prior NAVA introduction was compared with a cohort of thirty children treated with NIV-NAVA during implementation phase (after group). The primary end-point was intubation rate between groups. Days on mechanical ventilation, number of invasive devices, nosocomial infections, PICU/hospital length of stay (LOS), and physiological parameters at 2 and 24 h after admission were considered. RESULTS: Intubation rate was lower in the NIV-NAVA group as compared to the NIV-PS group (p = 0.006). Patients treated with NIV-NAVA required fewer invasive devices (p = 0.032) and had lower incidence of ventilator-acquired pneumonia (p = 0.004) and shorter PICU (p = 0.032) and hospital LOS (p = 0.013). At 2 h, NIV-NAVA compared with NIV-PS resulted in higher paO(2):FIO(2) (p = 0.017), lower paCO(2) (p = 0.002), RR (p = 0.026), and HR (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Early NIV-NAVA vs NIV-PS was associated to lower intubation rate and shorter PICU and hospital LOS. Further studies are needed in order to confirm these preliminary data.","Chidini, Giovanna; De Luca, Daniele; Calderini, Edoardo; Catenacci, Stefano Scalia; Marchesi, Tiziana; Langer, Thomas; Gregoretti, Cesare; Conti, Giorgio",J Anesth Analg Crit Care,543,16

However, the interplay between coping mechanism and positive mood state remains under-researched. AIM: To explore the associations among behavioral approach system (BAS) sensitivity level, coping, and positive mood states among people with BD. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, 90 participants with BD were presented with four BAS-activating life event scenarios and assessed with regard to their BAS trait sensitivity, coping flexibility, and mood states. A hierarchical clustering method was used to identify different groups with different styles of coping. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine the mediating and moderating roles of different components of coping on mood states. RESULTS: A three-cluster solution was found to best fit the present data set. The findings showed that a low mass of coping combined with low BAS sensitivity level protects people with BD from detrimentally accentuating mood states when they encounter BAS-activating life events. Moreover, coping flexibility is demonstrated to mediate and moderate the relationships between BAS sensitivity level and mood states. Specifically, subduing the perceived controllability and reducing the use of behavioral-activation/emotion-amplifying coping strategies could help buffer the effect of positive affect. CONCLUSION: The judicious use of coping in emotion regulation for people with BD when encountering BAS-activating life events was indicated. Practical applications and theoretical implications are highlighted.","Chan, Sunny Ho-Wan; Yu, Chong Ho; Liu, Ken Ho Kan; Lau, Charlie; Fung, Anna On Yee; Tse, Samson",World J Psychiatry,543,12

In this study, we evaluated adhesion formation to three relatively new meshes for intraperitoneal use. METHODS Three new meshes for intraperitoneal use (Omyra(®) mesh, Physiomesh(®), and Hi-Tex Endo-IP(®)) were implanted intraperitoneally in rats and compared with a polypropylene control mesh (Parietene(®)) after 7 or 90 days. Adhesion formation, incorporation (tensile strength), shrinkage, and foreign body reaction were scored. RESULTS Hi-Tex Endo-IP and Physiomesh(®) showed significantly less adhesion formation when compared to Parietene at both time points (p < 0.05). Shrinkage was highest in Omyra mesh after 90 days, which was significantly more compared to Parietene(®) (p < 0.001). Physiomesh(®) only showed a significant reduction in craniocaudal mesh length, compared to Parietene and Hi-Tex Endo-IP (p < 0.05). After 90 days, Hi-Tex Endo-IP(®) showed significantly higher and Physiomesh(®) significantly lower incorporation strengths compared to all other groups (p < 0.05). Microscopic evaluation revealed massive foreign body reaction to Hi-Tex Endo-IP(®), leading to an extensive and thick collagenous scar adherent to the abdominal wall. Fractioning of the Physiomesh(®) coating over time led to an increase in interfilamentary granuloma formation, leading to scar plate formation, but with only minimal to no abdominal wall adherence. Both Parietene(®) and Omyra(®) showed a mild foreign body response. CONCLUSION Although clear distinctions can be made between meshes and some meshes excel, none of the meshes are superior in all aspects required for effective and safe incisional hernia repair.","Vogels, R R M; van Barneveld, K W Y; Bosmans, J W A M; Beets, G; Gijbels, M J J; Schreinemacher, M H F; Bouvy, N D",Surgical endoscopy,543,1

Remifentanil 1.0 to 4.0 μg·kg(-1) and propofol 2.0-3.0 mg·kg(-1) or sevoflurane up to 8.0 Vol% provide acceptable, i.e. excellent or good intubating conditions. We hypothesized that sevoflurane 1.0 MAC would provide acceptable intubating conditions when combined with propofol and remifentanil. METHODS Eighty-three patients to be intubated were randomised to two groups. The SEVO group received propofol 1.5 mg kg(-1), remifentanil 0.30 μg kg min(-1) and sevoflurane 1.0 MAC; the MR group received the same doses of propofol and remifentanil plus rocuronium 0.45 mg kg(-1). We evaluated intubation and extubation conditions, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and bispectral index (BIS). The vocal cords were examined for injury by videolaryngoscopy before and 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS ACCEPTABLE INTUBATING CONDITIONS WERE SEEN MORE FREQUENTLY WITH ROCURONIUM THAN WITH SEVOFLURANE: 97% versus 82%; p = 0.03; the subscore for vocal cords was comparable: 100% versus 98%. MAP before intubation decreased significantly compared with the MAP at baseline to the same extent in both groups; ephedrine IV was given in 15 (SEVO) versus 16 (MR) patients; p = 0.93. BIS at tracheal intubation was 27 (13-65) in the SEVO group, 29 (14-62) in the MR group; p = 0.07. Vocal cord injuries (oedema, haematoma) were similar: 4 patients in each group.

Available reviews do not mention the concurrent occurrence of both myositis and acute kidney injury. METHODS In order to characterize the link between bacterial community-acquired atypical pneumonia and both myositis and a renal parenchymal disease, we reviewed the literature (United States National Library of Medicine and Excerpta Medica databases). RESULTS We identified 42 previously healthy subjects (35 males and 7 females aged from 2 to 76, median 42 years) with a bacterial atypical pneumonia associated both with myositis (muscle pain and creatine kinase ≥5 times the upper limit of normal) and acute kidney injury (increase in creatinine to ≥1.5 times baseline or increase by ≥27 μmol/L above the upper limit of normal). Thirty-six cases were caused by Legionella species (N = 27) and by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (N = 9). Further germs accounted for the remaining 6 cases. The vast majority of cases (N = 36) presented a diffuse myalgia. Only a minority of cases (N = 3) were affected by a calf myositis. The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis-associated kidney injury was retained in 37 and that of acute interstitial nephritis in the remaining 5 cases. CONCLUSION Bacterial atypical pneumonia may occasionally induce myositis and secondary kidney damage.","Simoni, Chiara; Camozzi, Pietro; Faré, Pietro B; Bianchetti, Mario G; Kottanattu, Lisa; Lava, Sebastiano A G; Milani, Gregorio P",Journal of infection and public health,543,16

The COVID-19 pandemic led Brazil to recommend and, at times, impose social distancing, with the partial closure of economic activities, schools, and restrictions on events and public services. Preliminary evidence shows that intense coexistence increases domestic violence, while social distancing measures may have prevented access to public services and networks, information, and help. We propose an agent-based model (ABM), called VIDA, to illustrate and examine multi-causal factors that influence events that generate violence. A central part of the model is the multi-causal stress indicator, created as a probability trigger of domestic violence occurring within the family environment. Two experimental design tests were performed: (a) absence or presence of the deterrence system of domestic violence against women and (b) measures to increase social distancing. VIDA presents comparative results for metropolitan regions and neighbourhoods considered in the experiments. Results suggest that social distancing measures, particularly those encouraging staying at home, may have increased domestic violence against women by about 10%. VIDA suggests further that more populated areas have comparatively fewer cases per hundred thousand women than less populous capitals or rural areas of urban concentrations. This paper contributes to the literature by formalising, to the best of our knowledge, the first model of domestic violence through agent-based modelling, using empirical detailed socioeconomic, demographic, educational, gender, and race data at the intraurban level (census sectors).","Madeira, L'igia Mori; Furtado, Bernardo Alves; Dill, Alan Rafael",,543,1

The success of this program to control the spread of COVID-19 is greatly influenced by knowledge, attitudes, and actions in the community. The purpose of this study was to identify behavioral factors during the pandemic. An online survey was conducted with 100 online taxibike drivers using a structured questionnaire and Google Forms. Data were analyzed using the Spearman rank test with CI of 95%. Although most online taxibike drivers have sufficient knowledge about COVID-19, some drivers had important misconceptions about COVID-19, namely that COVID-19 is not contagious, weak immune resistance may cause them to contract COVID-19, and it is highly unlikely that they will contract COVID-19 when leaving the house without wearing a mask, and believing that handwashing with soap and using hand sanitizer will not prevent COVID-19. To address these misconceptions, interventions should be targeted to online taxibike drivers to increase their health education and literacy regarding the urgency of preventing COVID-19.

Our model allowed us to make fairly accurate spatial predictions of both long-term and short-term exposure to air pollutants, with a low computational cost.

A major obstacle has been capturing variations in the underlying kinetics of transmission resulting from changes in public policy, individual behaviors, and evolution of the virus. However, the availability of standardized forecasts and versioned data sets from this period allows for continued work in this area. Here we introduce the Gaussian Infection State Space with Time-dependence (GISST) forecasting model. We evaluate its performance in 1-4 week ahead forecasts of COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions, and deaths in the state of California made with official reports of COVID-19, Google's mobility reports, and vaccination data available each week from June 29, 2020 to April, 26, 2021. Evaluation of these forecasts with a weighted interval score shows them to consistently outperform a naive baseline forecast and often score closer to or better than a high-performing ensemble forecaster. The GISST model also provides parameter estimates for a compartmental model of COVID-19 dynamics, includes a regression submodel for the transmission rate, and allows for parameters to vary over time according to a random walk. GISST provides a novel, balanced combination of computational efficiency, model interpretability, and applicability to large multivariate data sets that may prove useful in improving the accuracy of infectious disease forecasts.","O'Dea, E.

We conducted a prospective, quasi-randomized clinical trial in 511 patients with advanced COPD, or a recent COPD exacerbation, to test whether Proactive iCare impacts patient- centered outcomes and healthcare utilization. Patients were allocated to Proactive iCare (n =352) or Usual Care (n = 159), and were examined for changes in quality of life using the St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), symptoms, guideline-based care, and healthcare utilization. Findings. Proactive iCare improved the total SGRQ by 7-9 units (p<0.0001), symptom SGRQ by 9 units (p<0.0001), activity SGRQ by 6-7 units (p<0.001) and impact SGRQ by 7-11 units (p<0.0001) at 3, 6 and 9 months, compared with Usual Care.

The results show that depending on the specific stage of epidemic prevention and control, the number of unique pedestrian flow patterns decreased from four before the epidemic to two during the strict control stage and then increased to six during the initial resumption of work. The restrictions on movement are correlated with most of the visitations, and the release of restrictions led to an increase in the variety of unique pedestrian flow patterns compared to that in the pre-restriction period, even though the overall number of visitations decreased, indicating that social restrictions led to differences in the flow patterns of POIs and increased social distance.","Li, Yihang Xu Liyan",ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,543,16

Although early detection of the COVID-19 virus by Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is effective, it is not efficient;as there can be false negatives, it is time consuming and expensive. To increase the accuracy of in-vivo detection, radiological image-based methods like a simple chest X-ray (CXR) can be utilized. This reduces the false negatives as compared to solely using the RT-PCR technique. This paper employs various image processing techniques besides extracted texture features from the radiological images and feeds them to different artificial intelligence (AI) scenarios to distinguish between normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. The best scenario is then adopted to build an automated system that can segment the chest region from the acquired image, enhance the segmented region then extract the texture features, and finally, classify it into one of the three classes. The best overall accuracy achieved is 93.1% by exploiting Ensemble classifier. Utilizing radiological data to conform to a machine learning format reduces the detection time and increase the chances of survival. © 2021, Brno University of Technology.

Its main statistical properties are studied, including the cumulative and hazard rate functions, moments, and entropy. The new distribution is considered to be suitable for modeling purposes;its parameter is estimated by eight classical methods.

Additionally, accurate assessment of the evolution, extent, and dynamics of the outbreak are required to understand the transmission of the virus amongst seemingly unrelated cases and provide critical epidemiological information. To address these challenges, we evaluated a new high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel that includes 40 viral pathogens to analyze viral subtypes, mutational variants of SARS-CoV-2, model to understand the spread of the virus in the state of Georgia, USA, and to assess other circulating viruses in the same population. Methods This study evaluated a total of 522 samples that included 483 patient samples and 42 synthetic positive control materials. The performance metrics were calculated for both clinical and reference control samples by comparing detection results with the RT-PCR assay. The limit of detection (LoD) studies were conducted as per the FDA guidelines. Inference and visualization of the phylogeny of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences were performed through the Nextstrain Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool, utilizing the associated augur and auspice toolkits. Result The performance metric was calculated using both the clinical samples and the reference control with a PPA, NPA, and accuracy of 95.98%, 85.96%, and 94.4%, respectively. The LoD was determined to be 10 copies/ml with all 25 replicates detected across two different runs. The clade for pangolin lineage B contains certain distant variants, including P4715L in ORF1ab, Q57H in ORF 3a and, S84L in ORF8 covarying with the D614G spike protein mutation were found to be prevalent in the early pandemic in Georgia, USA. Isolates from the same county formed paraphyletic groups in our analysis, which indicated virus transmission between counties. Conclusion The study demonstrates the clinical utility of the NGS panel to identify novel variants that can provide actionable information to prevent or mitigate emerging viral threats, models that provide insights into viral transmission patterns and predict transmission/ resurgence of regional outbreaks and provide critical information on co-circulating respiratory viruses that might be independent factors contributing to the global disease burden.","Sahajpal, N.

In recent years however, several examples of box C/D snoRNAs regulating different levels of gene expression including transcript stability and splicing have been reported. These regulatory interactions typically require direct binding of the target but do not always involve the guide region. Supporting these new box C/D snoRNA functions, high- throughput RNA-RNA interaction datasets detect many interactions between box C/D snoRNAs and messenger RNAs. To facilitate the study of box C/D snoRNA functionality, we created snoGloBe, a box C/D snoRNA machine learning target predictor based on a gradient boosting classifier and considering snoRNA and target sequence and position as well as target type. SnoGloBe convincingly outperforms general RNA duplex predictors and PLEXY, the only box C/D snoRNA-specific target predictor available. The study of snoGloBe human transcriptome-wide predictions identifies enrichment in snoRNA interactions in exons and on exon-intron junctions. Some specific snoRNAs are predicted to target groups of functionally-related transcripts on common regulatory elements and the exact position of the predicted targets strongly overlaps binding sites of RNA-binding proteins involved in relevant molecular functions. SnoGloBe was also applied to predicting interactions between human box C/D snoRNAs and the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, identifying known and novel interactions. Overall, snoGloBe is a timely new tool that will accelerate our understanding of C/D snoRNA targets and function.","Deschamps-Francoeur, Gabrielle; Couture, Sonia; Abou-Elela, Sherif; Scott, Michelle S.",bioRxiv,543,9

Trait reduction is one of the major steps in decision making problems. It refers to the determination of a minimum subset of attributes which preserves the final decision based on the entire set of attributes. Unfortunately, most of the current features are irrelevant or redundant, which makes these systems unreliable and imprecise. This paper proposes a new paradigm based on fuzzy soft relationship and level fuzzy soft relationship, called Union - Intersection decision making method. Using these new principles, the decision-making strategy is structured to choose a fuzzy set of optimal elements from the alternatives on the basis of a fuzzy soft set.

The health care system had to accept the concept of destructuring crisis and ultimately piloting with uncertainty. The key factor during the crisis was to avoid the saturation of the care system especially for the intensive care unit. Upon the hospital medical crisis unit request, the DYNAMO team was accountable to propose solutions for “outflow”. Under the crisis medical director's green light, the DYNAMO unit has opened flow between the hospital intensive care unit and step down units created de novo (public and private). DYNAMO is the outcome of the collaboration and joint preparation between the university medical department DREAM and RAID Tactical medical unit allowing the use of technical tools and adding the tactical spirit into the hospital frame. This collaboration has supported the transfer in secure conditions of about 100 patients across the intensive care units with a consistent distribution of patients in order to maintain the most efficient intensive care units impacted by the crisis able to accept an influx of new patients. To achieve this, the DYNAMO team defined medical criteria to determine a patient's eligibility to be transferred under the team transfer supervision. The methodology is formed by 4 independent loops: the requester service, the transfer team, the medium for transfer and the receiver service. This model appeared to be simple, agile and autonomous.

Telemedicine is emerging as a cost effective way to enhance patient's care. With the COVID19 pandemic, vitualconsultation had been became more widely used. The effectiveness and safety of tele-health intervention in cardiovascular condition in the UK remains unclear. Aim To describe our early experience and outcomes setting up virtual teleconsultation for stable follow up cardiology patients in a district general hospital. Method Since April 2019, a single cardiologist (AF) started enrolling selected stable cardiology follow up patients onto the virtual follow-up. Following the initial standard consultation, the results of the investigations would be reviewed by the attending cardiologist and subsequent consultation would be carried out via pre-arranged telephone appointment if patients are agreeable. Patient's outcomes and satisfaction survey were collated, sustainability and social benefits and environmental impact of the pilot were analysed. Result A total of 116 patients were enrolled into the pilot. Fifty eight percent were males with an average age of 67 years (range 26-93). Conditions enrolled were: stable ischaemic heart disease (put numbers and percentage 42%), Stable valvular heart disease (26%), arrhythmias (13%), heart failure (9%) and others (9%). Sixty patients (52%) were discharged and 42% (49) patients had further routine tele-clinic follow-up. There were 6% (7) patients failed to attend the telephone consultation. Patients feedback was overwhelmingly positive with the main themes being: Convenience, avoiding car parking congestion, avoiding traffic / transportation issues as well as avoiding overall visit costs. The main concerns raised in patients using tele-consultation were related: 1) Mobile phone connectivity 2) Privacy issues and 3) Logistic of completing pre-requisite investigation prior appointment. Figure 1 demonstrates the clinic's sustainability benefits. The did not attend (DNA) rates were significantly less compared to standard clinic (5.8% vs 8.2%). This pilot saved the trust c.a £3000 on consumables and logistics support and maximised outpatient clinic capacity utilisation. Conclusion Telemedicine had been shown to be a safe and effective method in the care of stable cardiology patients. The social, economic and environmental benefit of tele-consultation raised exciting opportunity for future service designs. Collaboration between hospital specialist, management team, community health providers and communication service suppliers are vital to ensure the sustainable implementation of telemedicine in cardiology.","Yao, Z.; Farag, A.; Mullineux, P.; Matthews, W.; Carimichael, M.; Barlow, C.",Heart,543,16

A nationally representative, longitudinal survey of 2,490 Americans showed that prosocial concern had a larger positive influence on vaccination against influenza in sparser regions, as judged by a region's nonmetropolitan status, lesser population density, and lower proportion of urban land area. Two experiments (total n = 800), one preregistered, provide causal evidence that drawing attention to prosocial (vs. individual) concerns interacted with social density to affect vaccination intentions. Specifically, prosocial concern led to stronger intentions to vaccinate against influenza and COVID-19 but only when social density was low (vs. high). Moderated mediation analyses show that, in low-density conditions, the benefits of inducing prosocial concern were due to greater perceived impact of one's vaccination on others. In this light, public health communications may reap more benefits from emphasizing the prosocial aspects of vaccination in sparser environments.","Jung, Haesung; Albarracín, Dolores",Proc. Natl.

We aimed to investigate the blood coagulation function and its influences on clinical outcomes of patients with syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: A total of 71 severe patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were treated in Wuhan First Hospital from February 12 to March 20, 2020, were enrolled. The blood coagulation data in these patients and in 61 healthy controls were collected. The patients with COVID-19 were divided into two groups: the aggravated group and the nonaggravated group, respectively, basing on whether the patients' conditions turned to critically ill or not after admission. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with COVID-19 had significant performances with coagulation dysfunction, including dramatically elevated values of FIB, PT, APTT, INR, FDP, and D-Dimers but markedly reduced AT value (P < .05). Importantly, more noteworthy coagulation disorders similar to the differences between patients and controls were found in the aggravated patients with conditions deterioration after admission than those in the nonaggravated patients without conditions deterioration (P < .05). Moreover, the aggravated patients possessed a longer hospital stay and a higher mortality compared with the nonaggravated patients (P < .001). The coagulation parameters of COVID-19 patients were widely and closely related to the indexes of liver function and inflammation (P < .05), indicating the coagulation dysfunction of these patients may be caused by liver injury and inflammatory storm. CONCLUSION: Severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection often possess coagulation dysfunction on admission. A certain correlation exists in coagulation disorder and adverse clinical outcome among severe COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Yanhong; He, Liwei; Chen, Huixin; Lu, Shuangyan; Xiong, Yongfen; Liu, Juan; Zheng, Yao; Wang, Shun; Liu, Lei",Int. j. lab. hematol,543,16

Molecular clock analyses allowed us to estimate that the BCoV ancestor emerged in the 1940s, and that two geographically distinct lineages diverged from the 1960s-1970s. A recombination event in the spike gene (breakpoint at nt 1100) may be at the origin of the genetic divergence sixty years ago. Little evidence of genetic mixing between the spatially segregated lineages was found, suggesting that BCoV genetic diversity is a result of a global transmission pathway that occurred during the last century.

Coronaviruses encode polyproteins that are cleaved by 3CL protease (the main protease) for maturation. Therefore, 3CL protease is regarded as the main target of antivirals against coronaviruses. EGCG is a major constituent of brewed green tea, and several studies have reported that EGCG inhibits the enzymatic activity of the coronavirus 3CL protease. Moreover, EGCG has been reported to regulate other potential targets, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the viral spike protein. Finally, recent studies have demonstrated that EGCG treatment interferes with the replication of coronavirus. In addition, the bioavailability of EGCG and future research prospects are discussed.","Park, Junsoo; Park, Rackhyun; Jang, Minsu; Park, Yea-In",,543,25

METHODS: We undertook a quasi-experimental study reporting on a 5-month implementation period in 58 primary health care centres from municipal areas within Bogotá (Colombia), Mexico City (Mexico), and Lima (Peru). Within the municipal areas, units were randomized to four arms: (1) care as usual (control); (2) training alone; (3) training and municipal support, designed specifically for the study, using a less intensive clinical and training package; and (4) training and municipal support, designed specifically for the study, using a more intense clinical and training package. The primary outcome was the cumulative proportion of consulting adult patients out of the population registered within the centre whose alcohol consumption was measured (coverage). RESULTS: The combination of municipal support and training did not result in higher coverage than training alone (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.6 to 0.8). Training alone resulted in higher coverage than no training (IRR = 9.8, 95% CI = 4.1 to 24.7). Coverage did not differ by intensity of the clinical and training package (coefficient = 0.8, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.5). CONCLUSIONS: Training of providers is key to increasing coverage of alcohol measurement amongst primary health care patients. Although municipal support provided no added value, it is too early to conclude this finding, since full implementation was shortened due to COVID-19 restrictions.

This study aimed to assess the US public's initial understanding about the disease and virus to inform public health communication efforts. METHODS: We conducted a survey of US households from February 28 through March 2, 2020, using a probability-based web-panel survey of 1021 US residents. To assess knowledge about COVID-19, we asked respondents a series of 16 true/false questions. We conducted descriptive statistics and linear regression analyses to examine differences in knowledge scores based on demographic and background characteristics. RESULTS: Knowledge about COVID-19 and the virus was relatively low overall at the beginning of the outbreak, with average scores of 62% on a 16-item knowledge index (ie, answers for 6 of the 16 questions were incorrect or unknown). Knowledge was especially low among people who had low education and income levels, were unemployed, were Hispanic, were non-Hispanic Black, were aged 18-24 and 35-49, indicated having ""other"" health insurance, and had limited exposure to information about the pandemic. Non-Hispanic Black respondents were less knowledgeable about COVID-19 and the virus at every education level compared with non-Hispanic White respondents at higher education levels. Non-Hispanic Black respondents with <high school degree were the least knowledgeable of all subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study highlight the need for widespread, ongoing public health education about the virus and COVID-19, especially among certain populations. It is critical to effectively translate complex clinical and epidemiologic evidence into messages that most people can understand and act on during a pandemic, that combat misinformation about the virus and COVID-19, and that consider low levels of health literacy.","McCormack, Lauren A; Squiers, Linda; Frasier, Alicia M; Lynch, Molly; Bann, Carla M; MacDonald, Pia D M",Public Health Rep,543,12

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The total number of newly diagnosed cases of oral submucous fibrosis, oral leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, and oral cancers, recorded at two dental institutional settings before lockdown (January-March 2020) and after lockdown (June-August 2020), were included retrospectively and compared. RESULTS: The study included a total of 797 cases at both institutions. At Institution-I, a total of 312 cases were recorded before the lockdown, and 63 cases were recorded after the lockdown. At Institution-II, a total of 311 cases were reported before lockdown, and 111 cases were recorded after lockdown. Comparisons between the pre-lockdown and post-lockdown data yielded a significant change in the proportions of oral sub-mucous fibrosis, oral leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, and oral cancers at both institutions (Chi-square test; p < 0.001). Following the lockdown, a substantial reduction was observed in the proportion of oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) cases at both institutions, and the proportion of oral cancers increased at both institutions. There was a significant difference between the proportions of cases reported before lockdown at both institutions (p < 0.001). However, after-lockdown, no such differences were noted (p = 0.69); the absence of significance could most likely be due to the low sample size or low-power during the post-lockdown period. CONCLUSION: The oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) and oral cancer (OC) patient volumes reduced substantially following lockdown. During the post-lockdown period, the proportion of oral cancers increased, whereas the proportion of OSMF cases decreased. Results indicate that OPMD and oral cancer patients were impacted differently by the lockdown. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides insight into the impact of lockdown and highlights the importance of reestablishing oral oncology-related patient care.

The measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have brought various restrictions both in social life and in areas such as education, economy and health. Due to the pandemic and subsequent restrictions, students continuing to higher education are likely to experience some psychological problems such as anxiety and depression. Therefore, studies regarding the anxiety levels of students should be carried out. In line with this need, the aim of the study is to adapt the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) into Turkish in the context of higher education. The sample consisted of 513 undergraduate and graduate students. The data collection tools were the CAS and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The results of the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the factor structure of the original scale and yielded an excellent fit for all the indices. The original factor structure of the CAS was also confirmed, and the scores significantly correlated with gender, state-anxiety and health status of the participants. The scores obtained from the adapted scale were found highly reliable and valid. The increase in the spread of COVID-19, especially after the mutations of the virus have emerged, indicates that its psychological and behavioral consequences and effects might last longer.

METHOD: A convenience sample was collected via Facebook from 2173 New Zealanders 18+ years during pandemic restrictions April/May 2020. Measures included: the quantity typically consumed during a drinking occasion and heavier drinking (6+ drinks on a typical occasion) in the past week; place of purchase including online alcohol delivery. Descriptive statistics were generated, logistic and linear regression models predicted heavier drinking and typical occasion quantity, respectively. Weighting was not applied. RESULTS: During pandemic restrictions, around 75% of respondents purchased from supermarkets, 40% used online alcohol delivery services (18% for the first time during COVID-19). Purchasing online alcohol delivery during pandemic restrictions was associated with heavier drinking (75% higher odds) in the past week, while purchasing from supermarkets was not. About 58% of online purchasers under 25 reported no age checks. Sixteen percent of those purchasing online repeat ordered online to keep drinking after running out. Of respondents who had tried to buy alcohol and food online, 56% reported that alcohol was easier to get delivered than fresh food. Advertising for online alcohol delivery was seen by around 75% of the sample. Half of the sample reported drinking more alcohol during the restrictions. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Online alcohol delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions was associated with heavier drinking in the past week. The rapid expansion of online alcohol delivery coupled with a lack of regulatory control requires public health policy attention.","Huckle, Taisia; Parker, Karl; Romeo, Jose S; Casswell, Sally",Drug alcohol rev,543,1

Here, we show that interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) is a useful and effective tool for creating Mpro complexes. We make these tools and models freely available. iMD-VR provides an immersive environment in which users can interact with MD simulations and so build protein complexes in a physically rigorous and flexible way. Recently, we have demonstrated that iMD-VR is an effective method for interactive, flexible docking of small molecule drugs into their protein targets (Deeks et al. PLoS One 2020, 15, e0228461). Here, we apply this approach to both an Mpro inhibitor and an oligopeptide substrate, using experimentally determined crystal structures. For the oligopeptide, we test against a crystallographic structure of the original SARS Mpro. Docking with iMD-VR gives models in agreement with experimentally observed (crystal) structures. The docked structures are also tested in MD simulations and found to be stable. Different protocols for iMD-VR docking are explored, e.g., with and without restraints on protein backbone, and we provide recommendations for its use. We find that it is important for the user to focus on forming binding interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, and not to rely on using simple metrics (such as RMSD), in order to create realistic, stable complexes. We also test the use of apo (uncomplexed) crystal structures for docking and find that they can give good results. This is because of the flexibility and dynamic response allowed by the physically rigorous, atomically detailed simulation approach of iMD-VR. We make our models (and interactive simulations) freely available. The software framework that we use, Narupa, is open source, and uses commodity VR hardware, so these tools are readily accessible to the wider research community working on Mpro (and other COVID-19 targets). These should be widely useful in drug development, in education applications, e.g., on viral enzyme structure and function, and in scientific communication more generally.","Deeks, Helen M; Walters, Rebecca K; Barnoud, Jonathan; Glowacki, David R; Mulholland, Adrian J",J. chem. inf. model,543,24

ADI castings are difficult-to-cut materials; therefore, advanced techniques to improve manufacturing productivity are necessary and under research. On the other hand, spiral roughness pattern produced by turning operation is a common source of unconformities in several applications. Turning produces a defined kinematic pattern, similar to a thread. This work presents a theoretical and experimental validation using different burnishing conditions. Roughness and surface topography and surface integrity were checked. Results show that the technique greatly improves surface roughness, and eliminates the kinematic-driven roughness pattern of turning, leading to a more isotropic finishing.

Currently, the need for computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) relies on the Wells score and serum D-dimer levels. However, because COVID-19 patients have a different thrombotic and inflammatory milieu, the usefulness of the Wells score deserves further exploration for this patient population. We aimed to explore the ability of the Wells score to predict pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients found to have a CTPA and a COVID-19 diagnosis during the same admission were selected for analysis. Age and sex, CTPA results, and associated D-dimer levels were entered in a database. The Wells score sensitivity and specificity were calculated at different values, and the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve measured. RESULTS: Of 459 patients with COVID-19, 64 had a CTPA and 12 (19%) had evidence of pulmonary embolism. Previous or current evidence of deep vein thrombosis, a Wells score above 4 points, and serum D-dimer levels 5 times above age-adjusted upper normal values were associated with pulmonary embolism. However, only 33% of patients with pulmonary embolism had a Wells score of 4 points or higher. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic showed non-discriminating values (0.54) CONCLUSIONS: Although a Wells score of 4 or more points predicted pulmonary embolism in our cohort, the outcome can be present even with lower scores.","Kirsch, Brittany; Aziz, Moez; Kumar, Sungita; Burke, Michael; Webster, Tyler; Immadi, Amrutha; Sam, Maurine; Lal, Aditya; Estrada-Y-Martin, Rosa M; Cherian, Sujith; Aisenberg, Gabriel Marcelo",Am. j. med,543,32

COVID-19 also has indirect effects from the lockdown and the possible lack of food. We aimed to evaluate the perception of this in Celiac Disease (CeD) patients who require a lifelong gluten-free diet as a therapy. METHODS: We invited by e-mail CeD adult patients from the University of Salerno (Campania, South Italy) and the University of Padua (Veneto, North Italy) to answer an ad hoc COVID-19 survey. RESULTS: We sent the web survey to 651 email addresses and we received 276 answers (42,4%). CeD patients did not feel more vulnerable because they had CeD (not at all 56.6%) and they did not worry much about the possible shortness of gluten-free food during the epidemic (not at all 48.5%). The most worried were the elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities and females. Finally, CeD patients were happy with remote consultations and explicitly asked to have them. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted a proportion of patients with CeD; in particular, women, elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities. COVID-19, although a challenging experience from the medical and the psychological point of view, has offered an opportunity to practice, on a large-scale, a remote consultation approach for CeD healthcare.","Siniscalchi, Monica; Zingone, Fabiana; Savarino, Edoardo Vincenzo; D039,; Odorico, Anna; Ciacci, Carolina",Dig. liver dis,543,33

However, so far there has been scant attention paid to other important areas of psychiatry during COVID-19, including medico-legal aspects and human rights. In this paper, we discuss the legal implications for psychiatry of the COVID-19 pandemic and report a novel situation in which psychiatric patients may experience diminution of their statutory protections.

Anne McGuire had agreed to speak as a keynote, but time differences between Western Australia and Canada made even a Zoom call keynote impractical (the difficulties of syncing Zoom sessions and time zones became one of the many new problems of academic life in 2020). Accordingly, McGuire very kindly agreed to respond to my questions via email, the results of which were subsequently published in the conference catalogue, and served as a platform for a panel discussion on the final day, which included Will Davies (Goldsmiths), Stephanie Alice Baker (City, University of London), and Jeremy Gilbert. I had become aware of McGuire’s work through my own research on neoliberal mental healthcare and the newly emerging logics of spectrality that could be detected in institutional psychiatry’s interest in dimensions of health, illness, and comorbidity, and in the popular discourses around the ‘mental health spectrum’. As an academic working in disability studies, McGuire’s work on ‘mental illness’ (or madness, as many would prefer) is thought provoking and productive in its capacity to reassess contemporary institutional and discursive reformulations of health, sanity, and normality—and, furthermore, how these reformulations are irreducibly linked to the disempowerment and exploitation of the mad. McGuire’s work took on a new significance for me in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent global lockdowns, and with the emerging global discussion of the necessity of a more positive stance on tele-health and digital platforms for ‘sufferers’ of ‘mental illnesses’. Her capacity to show how supposedly novel and progressive forms of psychopathology and care—such as the notion of the mental health spectrum, which purportedly moves us beyond stigmatising notions of abnormality—reproduce hierarchies and social injustice, was incredibly helpful for negotiating the rhetoric of ‘the new normal’ that pervaded 2020. It was in the attempt to locate the meaning of the ‘new normal’ for those circumscribed within the institutions and discourses of ‘mental illness’—i.e., the reinvention of existing norms, inequalities, and injustices both in response to, and in some instances by way of the COVID-19 pandemic—that I turned to, and continue to turn to, McGuire’s work.

Kenya swiftly implemented mitigation policies; we assess the economic, social and health-related harm disproportionately impacting women. DESIGN: A prospective longitudinal cohort study with repeated mobile phone surveys in April, May and June 2020. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 2009 households across five informal settlements in Nairobi, sampled from two previously interviewed cohorts. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes include food insecurity, risk of household violence and forgoing necessary health services due to the pandemic. Gender-stratified linear probability regression models were constructed to determine the factors associated with these outcomes. RESULTS: By May, more women than men reported adverse effects of COVID-19 mitigation policies on their lives. Women were 6 percentage points more likely to skip a meal versus men (coefficient: 0.055; 95% CI 0.016 to 0.094), and those who had completely lost their income were 15 percentage points more likely versus those employed (coefficient: 0.154; 95% CI 0.125 to 0.184) to skip a meal.

Considering the high prevalence of pneumonia and kidneys injury in COVID-19, frequent acid-base alterations are expected in patients admitted with SARS-Cov-2 infection. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of acid-base disorders in symptomatic patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: The retrospective study enrolled COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Modena from 4 March to 20 June 2020. Baseline arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis was collected in 211 patients. In subjects with multiple ABG analysis, we selected only the first measurement. A pH of less than 7.37 was categorized as acidemia and a pH of more than 7.43 was categorized as alkalemia. RESULTS: ABG analyses revealed a low arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PO2, 70.2 ± 25.1 mmHg), oxygen saturation (SO2, 92%) and a mild reduction of PO2/FiO2 ratio (231 ± 129). Acid-base alterations were found in 79.7% of the patient. Metabolic alkalosis (33.6%) was the main alteration followed by respiratory alkalosis (30.3%), combined alkalosis (9.4%), respiratory acidosis (3.3%), metabolic acidosis (2.8%) and other compensated acid-base disturbances (3.6%). All six patients with metabolic acidosis died at the end of the follow-up. CONCLUSION: Variations of pH occurred in the majority (79.7%) of patients admitted with COVID-19. The patients experienced all the type of acid-base disorders, notably metabolic and respiratory alkalosis were the most common alterations in this group of patients.","Alfano, Gaetano; Fontana, Francesco; Mori, Giacomo; Giaroni, Francesco; Ferrari, Annachiara; Giovanella, Silvia; Ligabue, Giulia; Ascione, Elisabetta; Cazzato, Silvia; Ballestri, Marco; Di Gaetano, Margherita; Meschiari, Marianna; Menozzi, Marianna; Milic, Jovana; Andrea, Bedini; Franceschini, Erica; Cuomo, Gianluca; Magistroni, Riccardo; Mussini, Cristina; Cappelli, Gianni; Guaraldi, Giovanni",Int. urol. nephrol,543,16

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the rapid scoring system on admission of these patients. METHODS: A total of 138 medical records of critically ill patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics on admission used for calculating Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) and outcomes (survival or death) were collected for each case and extracted for analysis. All patients were divided into two age subgroups (<65 years and &#8805;65 years). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed for overall patients and both subgroups. RESULTS: The median [25th quartile, 75th quartile] of MEWS of survivors versus nonsurvivors were 1 [1, 2] and 2 [1, 3] and those of REMS were 5 [2, 6] and 7 [6, 10], respectively. In overall analysis, the area under the ROC curve for the REMS in predicting mortality was 0.833 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.737 to 0.928), higher than that of MEWS (0.677, 95% CI = 0.541 to 0.813). An optimal cutoff of REMS (&#8805;6) had a sensitivity of 89.5%, a specificity of 69.8%, a positive predictive value of 39.5%, and a negative predictive value of 96.8%. In the analysis of subgroup of patients aged <65 years, the area under the ROC curve for the REMS in predicting mortality was 0.863 (95% CI = 0.743 to 0.941), higher than that of MEWS (0.603, 95% CI = 0.462 to 0.732). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this study was the first exploration on rapid scoring systems for critically ill patients with COVID-19. The REMS could provide emergency clinicians with an effective adjunct risk stratification tool for critically ill patients with COVID-19, especially for the patients aged <65 years. The effectiveness of REMS for screening these patients is attributed to its high negative predictive value.","Hu, Hai; Yao, Ni; Qiu, Yanru",Acad Emerg Med,543,17

Here, we characterized and compared the immunogenicity of two alphavirus-based DNA-launched self-replicating (DREP) vaccine candidates encoding either SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (DREP-S) or a spike ectodomain trimer stabilized in prefusion conformation (DREP-Secto). We observed that the two DREP constructs were immunogenic in mice inducing both binding and neutralizing antibodies as well as T cell responses. Interestingly, the DREP coding for the unmodified spike turned out to be more potent vaccine candidate, eliciting high titers of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies that were able to efficiently neutralize pseudotyped virus after a single immunization. In addition, both DREP constructs were able to efficiently prime responses that could be boosted with a heterologous spike protein immunization. These data provide important novel insights into SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design using a rapid response DNA vaccine platform. Moreover, they encourage the use of mixed vaccine modalities as a strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2.","Szurgot, Inga; Hanke, Leo; Sheward, Daniel J; Vidakovics, Laura Perez; Murrell, Ben; McInerney, Gerald M; Liljeström, Peter",Sci Rep,543,16

The country's borders were closed on March 23, and the lockdown of cities was also implemented. The unanticipated disruption of scholarly or professional advancement for the 94% of university students who are not currently learning may increase the burden of mental illness among these students and predispose them to social vices. Two suicide deaths occurred during the lockdown. Poverty, lack of trust in the government, ignorance, denial and misplaced religious zealotry negatively impact on the behavior of Nigerians. Fear-induced behavioral changes such as consuming lemon, ginger, garlic, local herbs, and other substances for protection have also become rampant. Loss of income due to the lockdown and the accompanying destitution can also be a pathfinder for numerous other sicknesses and deaths. For the benefit of enhanced prevention and control of infection, only government-funded hospitals and a few designated privately owned hospitals have been permitted to provide continued services at this time. The number of shifts in these hospitals were adjusted such that there are fewer health care professionals in the hospital at a given time. This strategy has inhibited treatment and care for certain groups of people who are not COVID-19 patients. Efforts are being made to develop telehealth services, but most rural residents may not benefit from them.

and group homes for the disabled are at signi?cant risk of contracting COVID-19 and subsequently infecting the residents, fellow co-workers, and their family In addition, lower paying long-term care healthcare workers maybe working multiple jobs which increases the risk of exposure In April 2020, 27% of all deaths in the population was among residents in long-term care The elderly population has the greatest risk for mortality from COVID-19 (Liu et al 2020) and are disproportionality a?ected by social distance and self-isolation Most long-term care settings have implemented lockdowns preventing families from visiting and limiting interactions among residents Social isolation of the elderly is considered a serious public health concern Social disconnection is a risk factor for increased depression and anxiety among the elderly It is hypothesized that elderly persons are at high risk for poor mental health outcomes from the COVID-19 pandemic The Alzheimer's Disease International suggest that those with dementia “may become more anxious, angry, stressed, agitated, and withdrawn during the outbreak” These factors potentially may increase stress on healthcare workers in long-term care settings beyond the fears of exposure and transmitting COVID-19 to their families There are few studies to date that examine the mental health impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers in long-term care The United Nations has highlighted the mental health risk to workers in long-term care “First responders and front line workers, particularly workers in health and long-term care play a crucial role in ?ghting the outbreak and saving lives However, they are under exceptional stress, being faced with extreme workloads, di?cult decisions, risks of becoming infected and spreading infection to families and communities, and witnessing deaths of patients ” Methods Healthcare workers in long-term care facilities, and assisted living facilities in Rhode Island were given questionnaires to complete that examined mental health and risk factors associated with COVID-19 The questionnaire includes items on the healthcare worker's experience with COVID-19 Resilience is measured using The Brief Resilience Scale assessing the individual's ability to bounce back or recover from stress Subjective incompetence is de?ned as the perceived incapacity to perform tasks and express feelings deemed appropriate in a stressful situation Increasing distress and subjective incompetence may convert a normal reaction to stress into mental disorder requiring intervention Demoralization is measured using the Demoralization Scale-II Depression and anxiety is measured using two of the most commonly used screens in clinical care, the PHQ-9 for depression and the GAD-7 for generalized anxiety Family functioning during and before the COVID-19 pandemic is measured using the three-item Brief Assessment of Family Functioning Social support is measured during and before the COVID-19 pandemic using the emotional-informational support subscale of the Brief Social Support Scale derived from the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey Coronavirus Anxiety Scale is a mental health screener designed to aid in the identi?cation of probable cases of dysfunctional anxiety associated with the COVID-19 pandemic The fear of Coronavirus-19 Scale was used to measure this construct The ?ve-item Primary Care PTSD Screen was adapted to COVID-19 as a traumatic event Items measuring healthcare worker workplace stress was developed based on a items from a number of existing scales A 15-item health care workers attitudes toward the management of COVID-19 in the long-term care facility was developed by the research team that focuses on training of sta?, safety, and resident care Results Preliminary data will be presented Data collection is currently underway There are 65 assisted living facilities and 85 nursing homes in Rhode Island Approximately 10% of the facilities are currently participating with the aim to recruit nearly all facilities in the state Conclusions The hypotheses to be tested is that healthcare workers in long-term care settings have mental health issues including demoralization, depression and anxiety due to the COVID-19 pandemic disaster That those who are in facilities with COVID-19 residents have increased stress Those facilities that have placed increased demands on healthcare workers will have employees that are having more difficulty in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic This study examines how healthcare

Whilst a number of recent reports suggest that COVID-19 associated stroke tends to be severe, there is limited data on the effects of COVID-19 in prospective registries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To determine how COVID-19 infection may affect cerebrovascular disease, we evaluated the ischemic stroke sub-types, clinical course and outcomes prior to and during the pandemic in Qatar. The Hamad General Hospital (HGH) stroke database was interrogated for stroke admissions during the last 4 months of 2019 and January-May 2020. RESULTS: In Qatar the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased from only 2 in February to 779 in March, 12,628 in April and 45,501 in May. Stroke admissions to HGH declined marginally from an average of 97/month for six pre-COVID months to 72/month in March-May. There were 32 strokes that were positive for COVID-19. When compared to non-COVID-19 stroke during the three months of the pandemic, COVID-19 patients were younger with significantly lower rates of hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia. COVID-19 positive patients had more cortical strokes (34.4% vs 5.6%; p = 0.001), severe disease (NIHSS >10: 34.4% vs 16.7%; p = 0.001) prolonged hospitalization and fewer with good recovery (mRS 0-2: 28.1% vs 51.9%; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: When compared to six pre-COVID-19 months, the number of ischemic stroke admissions during the three months of the pandemic declined marginally. COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to have a large cortical stroke with severe symptoms and poor outcome.","Akhtar, Naveed; Abid, Fatma Ben; Kamran, Saadat; Singh, Rajvir; Imam, Yahia; AlJerdi, Salman; AlMaslamani, Muna; Shuaib, Ashfaq",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,543,16

METHODS: We obtained weekly mortality data for all-cause and four underlying causes of death (circulatory and respiratory disease (CRD), pneumonia and influenza (P&I), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ischemic heart disease (IDH)), and influenza surveillance data, from 2012 to 2018. A negative-binomial regression model was used to estimate influenza-associated EMRs in two age groups (<65 years and &#8805;65 years). RESULTS: It was estimated that an annual average of 10025 influenza-associated deaths occurred in Chongqing, corresponding to 5.2% of all deaths. The average EMR for all-cause death associated with influenza was 33.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 31.5-35.6) per 100 000 persons, and in separate cause-specific models we attributed 24.7 (95% CI: 23.3-26.0), 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7-0.8), 8.5 (95% CI: 8.1-9.0) and 5.0 (95% CI: 4.7-5.3) per 100 000 persons EMRs to CRD, P&I, COPD and IDH, respectively. The estimated EMR for influenza B virus was 20.6 (95% CI: 20.3-21.0), which was significantly higher than the rates of 5.3 (95% CI: 4.5-6.1) and 7.5 (95% CI: 6.7-8.3) for A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) pdm09 virus, respectively. The estimated EMR was 152.3 (95% CI: 136.1-168.4) for people aged &#8805;65 years, which was significantly higher than the rate for those aged <65 years (6.8, 95% CI: 6.3-7.2). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza was associated with substantial EMRs in Chongqing, especially among elderly people.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze gender differences in state anxiety, daily functional self-actualization, and functional cognition as well as the relationships among those factors in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: We collected data on the web from a sample of 204 people (102 men and 102 women) aged 60 years and older. In addition to a demographic questionnaire, we used the State-Trait Personality Inventory to assess state anxiety, the Daily Functional Actualization questionnaire to evaluate daily functional self-actualization, and the Daily Living Questionnaire to measure functional cognition. RESULTS: Significant gender differences were found for state anxiety (t202=-2.36, P=.02); daily functional self-actualization (t202=2.15, P=.03); and the functional cognition components: complex tasks (Z=-3.07, P=.002); cognitive symptoms that might be interfering (Z=-2.15, P=.028); executive functions (Z=-2.21, P=.024); and executive function monitoring (Z=-2.21, P=.027). Significant medium correlations were found between both state anxiety level and daily functional self-actualization (r=-0.62, P<.001) and functional cognition (r=0.37-0.40, P<.001). Gender predicted 3% of the variance in state anxiety level, while daily functional self-actualization predicted 41% and complex activities (Daily Living Questionnaire) predicted an additional 3% (F3,200=58.01, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: In older adults, anxiety is associated with cognitive decline, which may harm daily functional abilities and lead to social isolation, loneliness, and decreased well-being. Self-awareness and knowledge of gender differences and relationships between common available resources of daily functional self-actualization and functional cognition with anxiety may be strengthening factors in crisis periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rosenblum, Sara; Cohen Elimelech, Ortal",JMIR Aging,543,1

Courts around the world have had to respond quickly to the challenges presented by the pandemic and the associated social distancing restrictions. This has created significant challenges for the justice system and such challenges are likely to be further compounded in the post-pandemic era as there is a 'tsunami' of COVID-19-related disputes predicted. Methods: This study will examine how global court responses have transitioned from being primarily traditional, face-to-face proceedings to online court processes (as supported by internet technology). By adopting a comparative approach, we will analyse how some countries have adapted to this shift to online mode while also maintaining a focus on access to justice. Results: We argue that online modes of dispute resolution, often referred to as Online Dispute Resolution (ODR), can promote resolution while facilitating social distancing in this new COVID-era. The rapid shift from traditional court processes to an online mode has further assisted the public, lawyers and experts to access the justice system in some jurisdictions, even during the crisis. In light of the scale of recent changes, there have been concerns about the capacity of courts to adopt newer technologies as well as issues relating to the impact of a new online model of justice, particularly in terms of the barriers for more vulnerable members of society. Further, the use of disruptive technologies in some courts have posed questions around whether outcomes generated by these innovations reflect the meaning of 'justice' in its traditional sense. Conclusions: This article argues that courts should embrace newer technologies that support court services while being mindful of possible tech-related issues that can impact on justice objectives. We argue that by placing further emphasis on alternative dispute resolution methods and ODR into the future, this might offset the likely tsunami of COVID-related litigation which would enable courts, hospitals, medical professionals and patients to settle disputes in a just, equitable and more efficient manner.","Sourdin, Tania; Li, Bin; McNamara, Donna Marie",,543,1

The purpose was to assess and triage potential COVID-19 symptoms and to reduce the number of calls to public health-care helplines. The device was used almost 150,000 times in a few weeks and was described by politicians and administrators as a solution and success. However, high usage cannot serve as the sole criterion of success. What might be adequate criteria? And should digital triage for citizens by default be considered low risk? METHODS: This paper reflects on the uncertain aspects of the performance, risks and issues of accountability pertaining to the digital diagnostic device in order to draw lessons for future improvements. The analysis is based on the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM), the EU and US regulations of medical devices and the taxonomy of uncertainty in health care by Han et al. RESULTS: Lessons for future digital devices are (a) the need for clear criteria of success, (b) the importance of awareness of other severe diseases when triaging, (c) the priority of designing the device to collect data for evaluation and (d) clear allocation of responsibilities. CONCLUSIONS: A device meant to substitute triage for citizens according to its own criteria of success should not by default be considered as low risk. In a pandemic age dependent on digitalisation, it is therefore important not to abandon the ethos of EBM, but instead to prepare the ground for new ways of building evidence of effect.","Haase, Christoffer Bjerre; Bearman, Margaret; Brodersen, John; Hoeyer, Klaus; Risor, Torsten",Scand J Public Health,543,20

However, there is still significant debate in the scientific community as to which transmission pathways are most significant and how settings and behaviour affect risk of infection, which all have implications for which mitigation strategies are most effective. This study presents a general model to estimate the rate of viral transfer between individuals, objects, and the air. The risk of infection to individuals in a setting is then computed considering the behaviour and interactions of individuals between themselves and the environment in the setting, survival times of the virus on different surface types and in the air, and mitigating interventions (ventilation, hand disinfection, surface cleaning, etc.). The model includes discrete events such as touch events, individuals entering/leaving the setting, and cleaning events. We demonstrate the model capabilities on three case studies to quantify and understand the relative risk associated with the different transmission pathways and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies in different settings. The results show the importance of considering all transmission pathways and their interactions, with each scenario displaying different dominant pathways depending on the setting and behaviours of individuals therein. The flexible model, which is freely available, can be used to quickly simulate the spread of any respiratory virus via the modelled transmission pathways and the efficacy of potential mitigation strategies in any enclosed setting by making reasonable assumptions regarding the behaviour of its occupants. It is hoped that the model can be used to inform sensible decision-making regarding viral infection mitigations that are targeted to specific settings and pathogens.","Demis, Panagiotis; Mel, Ishanki De; Wragg, Hayley; Short, Michael; Klymenko, Oleksiy V.",,543,1

The main problem here is that the numerical solver is hard to combine with standard inference techniques. Recent work in probabilistic numerics has developed a new class of solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that phrase the solution process directly in terms of Bayesian filtering. We here show that this allows such methods to be combined very directly, with conceptual and numerical ease, with latent force models in the ODE itself. It then becomes possible to perform approximate Bayesian inference on the latent force as well as the ODE solution in a single, linear complexity pass of an extended Kalman filter / smoother - that is, at the cost of computing a single ODE solution.

Patients with multiple co-morbidities are more likely to develop these severe forms of the disease. The aim of this report is to highlight cases the analysis of which might help discover factors that influence the course and mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia. The past medical history of our elderly patient (75-year-old female) includes rectum resection with intraoperative cardiac arrest and successful resuscitation. In January 2020, the patient was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon and concomittant pulmonary embolism. Following 6 weeks of therapeutic dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) treatment, the cancerous colonic section was resected. The patient arrested intraoperatively but was successfully resuscitated. On post-operative day 15, the patient developed arterial anastomosis bleed, which necessitated acute right-sided hemicolectomy. Post-operatively she became pyrexial and COVID-19 was confirmed, but later became apyrexial with symptomatic treatment. Subsequently, the patient developed partial anastomosis insufficiency, which resolved with conservative management. Following three negative SARS-CoV-2 tests, she was successfully discharged from hospital. It is worthy of note that due to the active anastomosis bleed the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor treatment was stopped, and later the patient got infected with SARS-CoV-2. A long-lasting LMWH therapy was performed. The timely management of colorectal carcinoms remains important even during an epidemic. The appropriate treatment of these patients during the pandemic presents a great challenge for all doctors, but, as shown in our case report, surgical treatment of even those with multiple co-morbidities can be successful.

There were 243 representative participants of the Spanish population according to sex, age, and educational level. The methodology was mixed, qualitative for the first objective and quantitative for the second. The first used the Thematic Network, while the second used logistic regression. From the qualitative analysis, three major categories were extracted: intrinsic orientation, extrinsic orientation, and empty orientation. The quantitative results showed a clear advantage in well-being for the intrinsically oriented group. The group of intrinsic orientation presented a better coping ability while the group of extrinsic orientation was as little adaptive as the group of empty orientation.

Identification of biomarkers associated with ARDS risk may guide clinical diagnosis and prognosis. Objective: To systematically evaluate the association of blood metabolites with ARDS risk and survival. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, data from the Molecular Epidemiology of ARDS (MEARDS) study, a prospective cohort of 403 patients with ARDS and 1227 non-ARDS controls, were analyzed. Patients were recruited in intensive care units (ICUs) at Massachusetts General Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, both in Boston, Massachusetts, from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2014. Data analysis was performed from December 9, 2018, to January 4, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Participants were followed up daily for ARDS development defined by Berlin criteria, requiring fulfillment of chest radiograph and oxygenation criteria on the same calendar day during invasive ventilatory assistance. A 2-stage study design was used to explore novel metabolites associated with ARDS risk and survival. Results: Of the 1630 participants from MEARDS who were admitted to the ICU , 403 (24.7%) were diagnosed with ARDS (mean [SD] age, 63.0 [17.0] years; 251 [62.3%] male) and 1227 (75.3%) were at-risk but did not have ARDS (mean [SD] age, 62.3 [16.9] years; 753 [61.4%] male). Mendelian randomization suggested that genetically regulated serum mannose was associated with ARDS risk (odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53-0.78; P = 7.46 × 10-6) in the discovery stage. In the functional validation stage incorporating 83 participants with ARDS and matched at-risk participants in the control group from the ICU, the protective association of mannose with ARDS risk was validated (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.97; P = .03). Furthermore, serum mannose was associated with 28-day (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11-0.56; P = 6.95 × 10-4) and 60-day (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.19-0.71; P = 3.12 × 10-3) mortality and 28-day (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32-0.74; P = 6.41 × 10-4) and 60-day (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37-0.80; P = 2.11 × 10-3) survival. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, genetically regulated serum mannose appeared to be associated with ARDS risk and outcome, and increased serum mannose at admission was associated with reduced ARDS risk and better survival. These findings could inform prevention and clinical intervention in ARDS cases, which have increased with the expansion of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Wei, Yongyue; Huang, Hui; Zhang, Ruyang; Zhu, Zhaozhong; Zhu, Ying; Lin, Lijuan; Dong, Xuesi; Wei, Liangmin; Chen, Xin; Liu, Zhonghua; Zhao, Yang; Su, Li; Chen, Feng; Christiani, David C",JAMA Netw Open,543,16

The vascular impact will be greater in patients who have preexisting CAD. Here, we report a patient with COVID 19 disease with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) who developed acute STEMI in spite of prophylactic dose anticoagulation. Case Description - A 67 year old male with significant CAD s/p CABG X 5 and PCI with 18 stents, DM II, HTN presented with dyspnea, fever and non productive cough. He tested positive for Covid19 and found to have bilateral infiltrates on chest X ray and elevated inflammatory markers. Patient was hypoxic requiring 80 % High-flow nasal oxygen supplementation. His D dimer levels on admission was normal around 250 and his serial D dimer were in range of 250-310, with no evidence of venous thromboembolism on ultrasound of lower extremities. He was started on prophylactic anticoagulation with enoxaparin. On Day 9, patient was found to have apical and anterior STEMI. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated significant thrombus burden with occluded left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, occluded sephanous vein graft, occluded left anterior descending artery, occluded right coronary artery and left main with 90% occlusion. Percutaneous coronary intervention was deemed futile and not attempted in presence of mixed, refractory shock and profound respiratory failure. Patient died shortly thereafter. Discussion - Our patient developed severe acute coronary artery thrombosis in spite of prophylactic enoxaparin. The American Society of Hematology and CHEST guidelines suggests using prophylactic-intensity over intermediate or therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with COVID19 who do not have suspected or confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE). Our case highlights the fact that in COVID 19 affected patients with significant CAD, therapeutic anticoagulation should be seriously considered in spite of absence of randomized evidence and a normal D dimer doesn't necessarily preclude this risk.","Sidhu, G.; Kizhakkepat, J.; Padmanabhan, K.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,543,12

The first decision tree classifies the CXR images as normal or abnormal. The second tree identifies the abnormal images that contain signs of tuberculosis, whereas the third does the same for COVID-19. The accuracies of the first and second decision trees are 98 and 80%, respectively, whereas the average accuracy of the third decision tree is 95%. The proposed deep learning-based decision-tree classifier may be used in pre-screening patients to conduct triage and fast-track decision making before RT-PCR results are available.","Yoo, Seung Hoon; Geng, Hui; Chiu, Tin Lok; Yu, Siu Ki; Cho, Dae Chul; Heo, Jin; Choi, Min Sung; Choi, Il Hyun; Cung Van, Cong; Nhung, Nguen Viet; Min, Byung Jun; Lee, Ho",Front.

Therefore, during the different waves of the COVID-19 pandemic we have to face the problems of how to perform elective cardiac invasive procedures in non-COVID patients and which patients/procedures should be prioritised. In this context, the interplay between the pandemic stage, the availability of healthcare resources and the priority of specific cardiac disorders is crucial. Clear pathways for ""hot"" or presumed ""hot"" patients and ""cold"" patients are mandatory in each hospital. Depending on the local testing capacity and intensity of transmission in the area, healthcare facilities may test patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection before the interventional procedure, regardless of risk assessment for COVID-19. Pre-hospital testing should always be conducted in the presence of symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In cases of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 positive patients, full personal protective equipment using FFP 2/N95 masks, eye protection, gowning and gloves is indicated during cardiac interventions for healthcare workers.

The main hematological laboratory findings associated with the severe form of disease are represented by lymphopenia and eosinopenia which mostly occur in the elderly population characterized by cardiovascular comorbidities and immunosenescence. Besides, increased levels of D-dimer, procalcitonin, and C reactive protein (CRP) seem to be powerful prognostic biomarkers helping to predict the onset of coagulopathy. The host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can lead to an aberrant inflammatory response or ""cytokine storm"" which contributes to the severity of illness. At immunological level, patients affected by a severe form of COVID-19 show poor clinical trajectories characterized by differential ""immunotypes"" for which T cell response seems to play a critical role in understanding pathogenic mechanisms of disease. Also, patients with mild to severe COVID-19 displayed macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), very low human leukocyte antigen D related (HLA-DR) expression with a parallel reduction of CD04+ lymphocytes, CD19 lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. Corticosteroids resulted the best therapy for the immune dysregulation whereas repurposing of tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antagonist) appears to have mixed results in patients with COVID-19. Besides, anticoagulative therapy was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality and need of intubation among COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the beneficial use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma needs to be validated in large controlled clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the main hematological parameters with a prognostic value in COVID-19 and the basis of immunological reactivity during COVID-19, with a focus on ongoing clinical trials evaluating immune targets as possible therapeutic strategies.","Napoli, Claudio; Benincasa, Giuditta; Criscuolo, Clelia; Faenza, Mario; Liberato, Cinzia; Rusciano, Mariangela",Immunol Lett,543,10

This is most apparent when caregivers face high levels of stress or life adversity. To study this phenomenon in the current global context, this study examined the relation between stress/disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic and the mental health of female and male caregivers. Pre-pandemic childhood adversity was considered as a moderator of this association. A multi-national sample (United Kingdom, 76%; United States, 19%; Canada, 4%, and Australia, 1%) was recruited in May 2020, of whom 348 female and 143 male caregivers of 5-18 year-old children provided data on the constructs of interest. At this time, caregivers reported on their history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and COVID stress/disruption. About two months later (July 2020) caregiver mental health was evaluated. We examined differences between female and male caregivers on ACEs, COVID stress/disruption, and mental health (distress, anxiety, substance use, and posttraumatic stress). Main and interactive effects of ACEs and COVID stress/disruption on each mental health outcome were examined. Female caregivers reported higher COVID stress/disruption, more ACEs, and greater distress, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms compared to male caregivers. Among female caregivers, higher COVID stress/disruption and more adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) independently predicted all mental health outcomes, consistent with a stress accumulation model. Among male caregivers, a pattern of interactions between COVID stress/disruption and ACEs suggested that the effects of COVID stress/disruption on mental health was stronger for those with higher ACEs, especially for substance use, consistent with a stress sensitization model. Higher levels of stress and mental health difficulties among female caregivers suggests a disproportionate burden due to pandemic-related disruption compared to male caregivers. Findings speak to the disparate effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of female compared to male caregivers, and the role of pre-existing vulnerabilities in shaping current adaptation.","Wade, Mark; Prime, Heather; Johnson, Dylan; May, Shealyn S; Jenkins, Jennifer M; Browne, Dillon T",Soc Sci Med,543,24

Government reactions varied in different countries. In Malta, the authorities took immediate action, assessments scaling of the potential public health threat. The article aims to briefly outline Malta's pandemic preparedness while describing the processes and purchases to face this pandemic. Costings for this exercise in risk mitigation were estimated as a percentage of the country's gross domestic product and the national budget. RESULTS: Among many actions, the Intensive Care facilities were ramped up from 20 beds in one area to 100 beds in five areas. Up to 600 extra COVID-19 beds for severely ill patients were also catered for, in addition to creation of several swabbing centers. The Central Procurement and Supplies Department (CPSU) was responsible for the sourcing and distribution of all protective wear and equipment across the country for all Government departments. CPSU was also involved in sourcing alternative clinical locations to house COVID-19 positive patients. In Malta, COVID-19 preparations cost at least 100 million, that is 1.9% of total anticipated government expenditure for 2020. CONCLUSION: The local pandemic preparation ran smoothly apart from a number of hitches that were dealt with swiftly and efficiently, displaying an agility and nimbleness. Malta has been fortunate in that the Government, advised by Public Health, reacted swiftly in order to control local spread. The silver lining is that these preparations and the preparedness exercise will serve in good stead in the setting of future pandemics.","Grech, Victor; Cuschieri, Sarah; Grech, Peter; Farrugia, Ing Karl; Gauci, Charmaine",Early Hum Dev,543,33

The procedure comprises of apoptosis and pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a programmed procedure for cell death which is inflammatory in nature and this pathway gets activated via human caspase-4, human caspase-11 and human caspase-5. The activation of this process leads to release of pro-inflammatory mediators including cytokines, alarmins, IL-18 and IL-1ß. The pro-inflammatory mediators released via interaction of intracellular kinases direct the development of Rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized as disorder/disease that is auto-immune and chronic in nature. It involves erosions in marginal bone along with articular cartilage which is responsible for joint destruction. The cytokine along with its complex network is responsible for inflammation. The process of pyroptosis is linked with the destruction of plasma membrane, that releases these mediators and excessive release of these mediators is linked with rheumatoid arthritis.","Chadha, Swati; Behl, Tapan; Bungau, Simona; Kumar, Arun; Arora, Rashmi; Gupta, Amit; Uddin, Md Sahab; Zengin, Gokhan; Aleya, Lotfi; Setia, Dhruv; Arora, Sandeep",Curr.

The high number of undetected or asymptomatic cases of COVID-19, however, limits the capacity of the approach to model the full dynamics. As a result, the risk for countries with a low number of passengers from Hubei province appeared as low.

The goal of this study was to predict the potential of 25 small molecule drugs in clinical trials for COVID-19 to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions (DDIs), which could lead to potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with the use of concomitant medications. We focused on 11 transporters, which are targets for DDIs. In vitro potency studies in membrane vesicles or HEK293 cells expressing the transporters coupled with DDI risk assessment methods revealed that 20 of the 25 drugs met the criteria from regulatory authorities to trigger consideration of a DDI clinical trial. Analyses of real-world data from electronic health records, including a database representing nearly 120,000 patients with COVID-19, were consistent with several of the drugs causing transporter-mediated DDIs (e.g., sildenafil, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine). This study suggests that patients with COVID-19, who are often older and on various concomitant medications, should be carefully monitored for ADRs. Future clinical studies are needed to determine whether the drugs that are predicted to inhibit transporters at clinically relevant concentrations, actually result in DDIs.","Yee, Sook Wah; Vora, Bianca; Oskotsky, Tomiko; Zou, Ling; Jakobsen, Sebastian; Enogieru, Osatohanmwen J; Koleske, Megan L; Kosti, Idit; Rödin, Mattias; Sirota, Marina; Giacomini, Kathleen M",Clin. pharmacol. ther,543,16

We address this question by analyzing plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV and from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that, although cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare, indicating the presence of a non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether such low or non-neutralizing antibody response leads to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future.

During the first emergency phase of the epidemic, RT-qPCR on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, which is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, exhibited limitations due to availability of reagents and budget constraints. This stressed the need to develop screening procedures that require fewer resources and are suitable to be extended to larger portions of the population. RT-qPCR on pooled samples from individual NP swabs seems to be a promising technique to improve surveillance. We performed preliminary experimental analyses aimed to investigate the performance of pool testing on samples with low viral load and we evaluated through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations alternative screening protocols based on sample pooling, tailored to contexts characterized by different infection prevalence. We focused on the role of pool size and the opportunity to develop strategies that take advantage of natural clustering structures in the population, e.g. families, school classes, hospital rooms. Despite the use of a limited number of specimens, our results suggest that, while high viral load samples seem to be detectable even in a pool with 29 negative samples, positive specimens with low viral load may be masked by the negative samples, unless smaller pools are used. The results of MC simulations confirm that pool testing is useful in contexts where the infection prevalence is low. The gain of pool testing in saving resources can be very high, and can be optimized by selecting appropriate group sizes. Exploiting natural groups makes the definition of larger pools convenient and potentially overcomes the issue of low viral load samples by increasing the probability of identifying more than one positive in the same pool.","Baccini, Michela; Rocco, Emilia; Paganini, Irene; Mattei, Alessandra; Sani, Cristina; Vannucci, Giulia; Bisanzi, Simonetta; Burroni, Elena; Peluso, Marco; Munnia, Armelle; Cellai, Filippo; Pompeo, Giampaolo; Micio, Laura; Viti, Jessica; Mealli, Fabrizia; Carozzi, Francesca Maria",PLoS One,543,16

In multivariate analysis, CA-AKI was strongly associated to a history of CKD (OR 4.17, 95% CI 1.53-11.3), hypertension (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01-2.36), Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.32), and SOFA score (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.87-2.57). HA-AKI was associated with the requirement for mechanical ventilation (OR 68.2, 95% CI 37.1-126), elevated troponin I (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.01-3.83), and glucose levels at admission (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: CA-AKI and HA-AKI portend an adverse prognosis in CO-VID-19. Nevertheless, CA-AKI was associated with a higher comorbidity burden (including CKD and hypertension), while HA-AKI occurred in younger patients by the time severe multiorgan disease developed.","Martínez-Rueda, Armando J; Álvarez, Rigoberto D; Méndez-Pérez, R Angélica; Fernández-Camargo, Dheni A; Gaytan-Arocha, Jorge E; Berman-Parks, Nathan; Flores-Camargo, Areli; Comunidad-Bonilla, Roque A; Mejia-Vilet, Juan M; Arvizu-Hernandez, Mauricio; Ramirez-Sandoval, Juan C; Correa-Rotter, Ricardo; Vega-Vega, Olynka",Blood Purif,543,16

Indeed, estimation of unreported infections is crucial for a better understanding of the current emergency in China and in other countries. In this study, we aimed to estimate the unreported number of infections in China prior to the 23 January 2020 restrictions. To do this, we developed a Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered–Dead (SEIRD) model that estimated unreported infections from the reported number of deaths. Our approach relied on the fact that observed deaths were less likely to be affected by ascertainment biases than reported infections. Interestingly, we estimated that the basic reproductive number (R0) was 2.43 (95%CI = 2.42–2.44) at the beginning of the epidemic and that 92.9% (95%CI = 92.5%–93.1%) of total cases were not reported. Similarly, the proportion of unreported new infections by day ranged from 52.1% to 100%, with a total of 91.8% (95%CI = 91.6%–92.1%) of infections going unreported. Agreement between our estimates and those from previous studies proves that our approach is reliable for estimating the prevalence and incidence of undocumented SARS-CoV-2 infections. Once it has been tested on Chinese data, our model could be applied to other countries with different surveillance and testing policies.","Maugeri, Andrea; Barchitta, Martina; Battiato, Sebastiano; Agodi, Antonella",J.

Larvae obtained by induced reproduction were maintained individually in tissue-culture plates, at 25°C. Daily observations and morphometric measurements were performed. Larvae hatched with a total length (TL) of 3.02 ± 0.34 mm (average ± standard deviation) without pigmentation and 0.06 ± 0.02 mm³ of yolk reserves. The yolk-sac larval period lasted 26 h post-hatching (hph). During this period, eye pigmentation started, the digestive tract emerged, the anus opened, and the animals began to show steady movements. Inflation of the swimming bladder initiates the preflexion stage, which extended until 230 hph. During this stage, the transition from endogenous to exogenous feeding was observed, with the yolk reserve being completely absorbed after 74 hph (TL: 4.17 ± 0.36 mm). Up to 86 hph it was possible to observe the first food ingested within the digestive tract. This period was followed by the flexion stage, with the folding of the notochord tip and development of the caudal fin (11-13 days post-hatching). Finally, during the last larval developmental stage (postflexion), the segmentation of the fin rays was completed, and the emergence of scales was observed (TL: 5.97 ± 0.65 mm).

To this end, we adopted advanced deep network architectures and proposed a transfer learning strategy using custom-sized input tailored for each deep architecture to achieve the best performance. We conducted extensive sets of experiments on two CT image datasets, namely, the SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan and the COVID19-CT. The results show superior performances for our models compared with previous studies. Our best models achieved average accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score values of 99.4%, 99.6%, 99.8%, 99.6%, and 99.4% on the SARS-CoV-2 dataset, and 92.9%, 91.3%, 93.7%, 92.2%, and 92.5% on the COVID19-CT dataset, respectively.

For this critical review, dietary interventions recommended by the Expert Committee for the treatment of pediatric overweight/obesity were categorized according to their potential degree of dietary structure, and their impact on weight outcomes was described. Four levels of dietary structure were reviewed, operationalized as alterations to the following: food groups, such as fruits and vegetables (low structure); daily eating occasions, such as meals (moderate structure); large nutrients, such as energy (high structure); and energy plus additional dietary alterations (very high structure). In total, 24 interventions (four low, three moderate, five high, and 12 very high structure structure) were identified and reviewed.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, MedRxiv Database. We compared the laboratory indicators of renal impairment and incidences of AKI in the severe versus non-severe cases, and survival versus non-survival cases, respectively. RESULTS: In 41 studies with 10,335 COVID-19 patients, the serum creatinine (sCr) in severe cases was much higher than that in non-severe cases (SMD = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.29-0.39), with a similar trend for blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (SMD = 0.66, 95%CI: 0.51-0.81), hematuria (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.15-2.19), and proteinuria (OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.58-5.38).

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the information about the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the internet. METHODS: On February 29, 2020, we performed a Google search with the terms ""Prevention coronavirus,"" ""Prevention COVID-19,"" ""Prevención coronavirus,"" and ""Prevención COVID-19"". A univariate analysis was performed to study the association between the type of authorship, country of publication, and recommendations to avoid COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: In total, 80 weblinks were reviewed. Most of them were produced in the United States and Spain (n=58, 73%) by digital media sources and official public health organizations (n=60, 75%). The most mentioned WHO preventive measure was ""wash your hands frequently"" (n=65, 81%). A less frequent recommendation was to ""stay home if you feel unwell"" (n=26, 33%).

The C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR) is a novel inflammation-based prognostic score. This study was performed to examine the associations of the preoperative CAR with clinical outcomes in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) after curative resection. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the preoperative CAR in 184 patients who underwent curative resection for CRLM from November 2001 to January 2018 at Kumamoto University (Kumamoto, Japan). The optimal cutoff level of the preoperative CAR was determined by survival classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. We compared clinicopathological factors and prognoses between the high-CAR and low-CAR groups. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs), controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: A higher preoperative CAR was associated with worse overall survival (OS) (p < 0.0001) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p = 0.003). Applying survival CART analysis, the high-CAR group comprised 33 patients (17.9%). In the multivariate analyses, a high CAR was independently associated with shorter OS (HR, 2.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.63-4.72; p = 0.0004) and RFS (HR, 1.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.49; p = 0.040). A high CAR was associated with a large tumor size, high serum carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels, high intraoperative blood loss, and more postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: A high preoperative CAR is associated with shorter OS and RFS and might serve as a prognostic marker for patients with CRLM after curative resection.","Sakamoto, Yuki; Mima, Kosuke; Imai, Katsunori; Miyamoto, Yuji; Tokunaga, Ryuma; Akiyama, Takahiko; Daitoku, Nobuya; Hiyoshi, Yukiharu; Iwatsuki, Masaaki; Nagai, Yohei; Baba, Yoshifumi; Iwagami, Shiro; Yamashita, Yo-Ichi; Yoshida, Naoya; Baba, Hideo",Surg Oncol,543,1

Here we present the Najmanovich Research Group Toolkit for Elastic Networks (NRGTEN). NRGTEN is a Python toolkit that implements four different NMA models in addition to popular and novel metrics to benchmark and measure properties from these models. Furthermore, the toolkit is available as a public Python package and is easily extensible for the development or implementation of additional NMA models. The inclusion of the ENCoM model (Elastic Network Contact Model) developed in our group within NRGTEN is noteworthy, owing to its account for the specific chemical nature of atomic interactions. This makes possible some unique predictions of the effect of mutations, such as on stability (via changes in vibrational entropy differences), on the transition probability between different conformational states or on the flexibility profile of the whole macromolecule/complex (to study allostery and signalling). In addition, all NMA models can be used to generate conformational ensembles from a starting structure to aid in protein-protein, protein-ligand or other docking studies among applications. NRGTEN is freely available via a public Python package which can be easily installed on any modern machine and includes a detailed user guide hosted online.

METHODS: Participants were consented to answer a physician-administered questionnaire following Ramadan 2020. Impact of COVID-19 on the decision of fasting, intentions to fast and duration of Ramadan and Shawal fasting, hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia events were assessed. Specific analysis comparing age categories of <65 years and &#8805;65 years were performed. RESULTS: Among the 5865 participants, 22.5% were &#8805;65 years old. Concern for COVID-19 affected fasting decision for 7.6% (&#8805;65 years) vs 5.4% (<65 years). More participants &#8805;65 years old did not fast (28.8% vs 12.7%, <65 years). Of the 83.6%, participants fulfilling Ramadan-fasting, 94.8% fasted &#8805;15 days and 12.6% had to break fast due to diabetes-related illness. The average number of days fasting within and post-Ramadan were 27 and 6 days respectively, regardless of age. Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia occurred in 15.7% and 16.3% of participants respectively, with 6.5% and 7.4% requiring hospital care respectively. SMBG was performed in 73.8% of participants and 43.5% received Ramadan-focused education. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, universally high rates of Ramadan-fasting were observed regardless of fasting risk level. Glycemic complications occurred frequently with older adults requiring higher rates of acute hospital care. Risk stratification is essential followed by pre-Ramadan interventions, Ramadan-focused diabetes education and self-monitoring to reduce and prevent complications, with particular emphasis in older adults.","Hassanein, Mohamed; Hussein, Zanariah; Shaltout, Inass; Wan Seman, Wan Juani; Tong, Chin Voon; Mohd Noor, Nurain; Buyukbese, Mehmet Akif; El Tony, Lobna; Shaker, Gamal Mohamed; Alamoudi, Reem M; Hafidh, Khadija; Fariduddin, M; Batais, Mohammed A; Shaikh, Shehla; Malek, Pr Rachid; Alabbood, Majid; Sahay, Rakesh; Alshenqete, Abdulwadod M; Yakoob Ahmedani, Muhammad",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,543,16

This study aimed to identify what factors influence adherence to recently implemented public health measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing, trust of scientific organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) on information pertaining to the pandemic, and level of perceived risk. Data were collected from June 30, 2020 to July 22, 2020 on 951 adult residents of the United States using an online survey through Microsoft Forms. Multiple linear regression was used to identify the strongest predictors for compliance to pandemic-related health measures, trust in the scientific community, and perceived risk. Results showed that the strongest predictor of all variables of interest was degree of policy liberalism. Additionally, participants who consumed more conservative news media conformed less to the pandemic health guidelines and had less trust in the scientific community. Degree of policy liberalism was found to have a significant moderating effect on the relationship between gender and conformity to pandemic-related health behaviors. These findings have concerning implications that factors like degree of policy liberalism and source of news are more influential in predicting adherence to life-saving health measures than established risk factors like pre-existing health conditions.","Reinhardt, Madeleine; Findley, Matthew B; Countryman, Renee A",PLoS One,543,15

We aimed to evaluate the impact of the intervention on hospital visits in Yinzhou District, Ningbo, Zhejiang province, China. METHODS: We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis from 1 January 2017 to 6 September 2020 based on the Yinzhou Health Information System in Ningbo, Zhejiang province. The beginning of the intervention was on 23 January 2020, and thus, there were 160 weeks before the intervention and 32 weeks after the implementation of the intervention. Level changes between expected and observed hospital visits in the post-intervention period were estimated using quasi-Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Compared with the expected level, there was an estimated decrease of -22.60% (95% confidence interval (CI): -27.53%, -17.36%) in the observed total hospital visits following the intervention. Observed hospital visits for diseases of the respiratory system were found to be decreased dramatically (-62.25%; 95% CI: -65.62%, -58.60%). However, observed hospital visits for certain diseases were estimated to be increased, including diseases of the nervous system (+11.17%; 95% CI: +3.21%, +19.74%); diseases of pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (+27.01%; 95% CI: +17.89%, +36.85%); certain conditions originating in the perinatal period (+45.05%; 95% CI: +30.24%, +61.56%); and congenital malformation deformations and chromosomal abnormalities (+35.50%; 95% CI: +21.24%, +51.45%).

First, I analyse the virus itself and how its stealthy nature has transformed our lives. Second, I describe how the invisible epidemic of social media sharing of fake news about the virus worsens the situation further. Third, I explore how the virus has revealed to us what really matters in our lives and has forced us to re-evaluate our priorities. Fourth, I go on to explore the underlying structural weaknesses and disparities in society that have been exposed by the virus but previously remained unconsidered for so long that they too have become camouflaged, even if their effects are all too apparent; like the virus, neoliberal capitalism is an invisible enemy that has made prisoners of us all.

There is no report on XA presenting as a functioning adrenal mass in the literature. We present a case of XA mimicking a functioning adrenocortical carcinoma. CASE REPORT: A 52-year-old man presented with right flank pain, fever, vomiting, and loss of appetite for 2 weeks. He had signs of dehydration and elevated blood glucose level. Ultrasonography revealed a right adrenal mass. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed lobulated and necrotic mass replacing the right suprarenal gland and encasing the right renal vein, adjacent inferior vena cava, psoas, and diaphragm. There was loss of fat planes with liver and upper pole of the right kidney. Biochemical evaluation indicated increased serum and urine cortisol levels. As a sequel to hypercortisolism-induced hyperglycemia, he developed spontaneous chest wall abscess and bilateral sudden vision loss due to vitreous hemorrhages. Pus and blood culture grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Adrenal suppressant ketoconazole was administered for better glycemic control. With a diagnosis of locally advanced adrenocortical malignancy, right radical adreno-nephrectomy was performed, and cut section revealed a pus collection of around 100 mL. Histopathology examination showed xanthogranulomatous inflammation involving adrenal gland, Gerota's fascia, psoas, and lymph nodes. Postoperatively, the patient recovered satisfactorily with favorable glycemic control. CONCLUSION: XA can mimic adrenal neoplasms both clinically and radiologically and is associated with staphylococcal infection. It warrants surgical excision and culture-based antibiotics and is mostly diagnosed on postoperative histopathology.","Jayanth, Kalkunte Sriram; Balamurugan, S; Sureshkumar, Sathasivam; Anandhi, Amaranathan; Sree Rekha, J; Abdulbasith, K M; Rajesh, B S; Tajudeen, Muhamed",Tumori,543,16

The main organ affected in this infection is the lung and the virus uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the target cells. In this context, a controversy raised regarding the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAAS) blockers, as these drugs might increase ACE2 expression in some tissues and potentially increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is specially concerning in diabetic patients as diabetes is a risk factor for COVID-19. METHODS: 12-week old diabetic mice (db/db) were treated with ramipril, or vehicle control for 8 weeks. Non-diabetic db/m mice were included as controls. ACE2 expression and activity were studied in lung, kidney and heart of these animals. RESULTS: Kidney ACE2 activity was increased in the db/db mice as compared to the db/m (143.2% ± 23% vs 100% ± 22.3%, p = 0.004), whereas ramipril had no significant effect. In the lung, no differences were found in ACE2 when comparing db/db mice to db/m and ramipril also had no significant effect. In the heart, diabetes decreased ACE2 activity (83% ± 16.8%, vs 100% ± 23.1% p = 0.02), and ramipril increased ACE2 significantly (83% ± 16.8% vs 98.2% ± 15%, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: In a mouse model of type 2 diabetes, ramipril had no significant effect on ACE2 activity in either kidneys or in the lungs. Therefore, it is unlikely that RAAS blockers or at least angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection through increasing ACE2.","Vergara, Ander; Jacobs-Cachá, Conxita; Molina-Van den Bosch, Mireia; Domínguez-Báez, Pamela; Benito, Begoña; García-Carro, Clara; Serón, Daniel; Soler, María José",Mol Cell Endocrinol,543,16

Children, although important drivers of silent transmission, are not included in the current COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. Objective: To estimate the benefits of identifying silent infections among children as a proxy for their vaccination. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used an age-structured disease transmission model, parameterized with census data and estimates from published literature, to simulate the estimated synergistic effect of interventions in reducing attack rates during the course of 1 year among a synthetic population representative of the US demographic composition. The population included 6 age groups of 0 to 4, 5 to 10, 11 to 18, 19 to 49, 50 to 64, and 65 years or older based on US census data. Data were analyzed from December 12, 2020, to February 26, 2021. Exposures: In addition to the isolation of symptomatic cases within 24 hours of symptom onset, vaccination of adults was implemented to reach a 40% to 60% coverage during 1 year with an efficacy of 95% against symptomatic and severe COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: The combinations of proportion and speed for detecting silent infections among children that would suppress future attack rates to less than 5%. Results: In the base-case scenarios with an effective reproduction number Re = 1.2, a targeted approach that identifies 11% of silent infections among children within 2 days and 14% within 3 days after infection would bring attack rates to less than 5% with 40% vaccination coverage of adults. If silent infections among children remained undetected, achieving the same attack rates would require an unrealistically high vaccination coverage (&#8805;81%) of this age group, in addition to 40% vaccination coverage of adults. The estimated effect of identifying silent infections was robust in sensitivity analyses with respect to vaccine efficacy against infection and reduced susceptibility of children to infection. Conclusions and Relevance: In this simulation modeling study of a synthetic US population, in the absence of vaccine availability for children, a targeted approach to rapidly identify silent COVID-19 infections in this age group was estimated to significantly mitigate disease burden. These findings suggest that without measures to interrupt transmission chains from silent infections, vaccination of adults is unlikely to contain the outbreaks in the near term.","Moghadas, Seyed M; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C; Shoukat, Affan; Zhang, Kevin; Galvani, Alison P",JAMA Netw Open,543,6

The present study describes detailed observations of the frequency and nature of hand-to-mouth and other hand-to-face touching behavior among 14 male and female volunteers in a controlled, quasi-naturalistic setting. Participants performed four 15-min tasks: 1) installation of a brass object as part of a short home improvement project, 2) completion of a pen-and-paper survey, 3) engagement in a telephone conversation, and 4) use of headphones to listen to music. Video recordings of the participants performing each task were reviewed and coded for touches to the face with emphasis on specific regions of the face and palmar versus dorsal contacts. During the installation task, only one of the 14 participants was observed touching his face; this was to the nose, on two separate occasions. Summed across the three non-installation tasks, including palmar and dorsal contacts, participants touched their lips, their mouth, and anywhere on their face on average (range) 5.1 (0-19), 0.4 (0-3), and 27.7 (6-49) times, respectively. Facial contacts during these three non-installation tasks were predominantly with the palmar surface of the hand. The implications of these data are contextually specific, as the potential health impacts of face touching behavior among adults might differ based upon toxicity or virulence of hand contaminants of interest.","Lewis, Ryan C; Rauschenberger, Robert; Kalmes, Renee",J Toxicol Environ Health A,543,1

Both, in addition to growing poverty and severely limited access to resources and health services, are particularly devastating in marginalized and vulnerable communities in the Global South. The article looks at specific regions and countries to illustrate wider challenges faced by LGBTQ populations, ethnic minorities, domestic workers, migrants and sex workers. Against the background of these gendered intersectional challenges, the article then moves to discuss feminist initiatives and mobilizations to deal with the crisis in specific local contexts as well as nationally, regionally and transnationally.

We noted that, while social distancing interventions were in place, most new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were averted, even with modest reductions in contact among adults. However, when interventions ended, the epidemic rebounded.

The need for more accurate and efficient ways to manage blood demand and supply is an increasing concern. Building a technology-based, robust blood demand and supply chain that can achieve the goals of reducing ordering frequency, inventory level, wastage and shortage, while maintaining the safety of blood usage, is essential in modern healthcare systems. In this study, we summarize the key challenges in current demand and supply management for red blood cells (RBCs). We combine ideas from statistical time series modeling, machine learning, and operations research in developing an ordering decision strategy for RBCs, through integrating a hybrid demand forecasting model using clinical predictors and a data-driven multi-period inventory problem considering inventory and reorder constraints. We have applied the integrated ordering strategy to the blood inventory management system in Hamilton, Ontario using a large clinical database from 2008 to 2018. The proposed hybrid demand forecasting model provides robust and accurate predictions, and identifies important clinical predictors for short-term RBC demand forecasting. Compared with the actual historical data, our integrated ordering strategy reduces the inventory level by 40% and decreases the ordering frequency by 60%, with low incidence of shortages and wastage due to expiration. If implemented successfully, our proposed strategy can achieve significant cost savings for healthcare systems and blood suppliers. The proposed ordering strategy is generalizable to other blood products or even other perishable products.","Li, Na; Chiang, Fei; Down, Douglas G.; Heddle, Nancy M.",,543,26

However, the observational designs of the studies in which these associations are observed preclude causal inferences of hospitalization risk. Mendelian Randomization (MR) is an alternative risk estimation method more robust to these limitations that allows for causal inferences. We applied four MR methods (MRMix, IMRP, IVW, MREgger) to publicly available GWAS summary statistics from European (COVID-19 GWAS n = 2956) and multi-ethnic populations (COVID-19 GWAS n = 10,908) to better understand extant causal associations between Type II Diabetes (GWAS n = 659,316), BMI (n = 681,275), diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure (n = 757,601 for each) and COVID-19 hospitalization risk across populations. Although no significant causal effect evidence was observed, our data suggested a trend of increasing hospitalization risk for Type II diabetes (IMRP OR, 95% CI 1.67, 0.96-2.92) and pulse pressure (OR, 95% CI 1.27, 0.97-1.66) in the multi-ethnic sample.

The aim of this study was to longitudinally assess symptoms of (un-)specific anxiety and depression along different stages of the pandemic to generate knowledge about the progress of psychological consequences of the pandemic and to test the role of potential risk and resilience factors that were derived from cross-sectional studies and official recommendations. METHODS: The present study uses a longitudinal observational design with four waves of online data collection (from March 27 to June 15, 2020) in a convenience sample of the general population in Germany. A total of N = 2376 participants that completed at least two waves of the survey were included in the analyses. FINDINGS: Specific COVID-19-related anxiety and the average daily amount of preoccupation with the pandemic decreased continuously over the four waves. Unspecific worrying and depressive symptoms decreased on average but not on median level. Self-efficacy, normalization, maintaining social contacts, and knowledge, where to get medical support, were associated with fewer symptoms relative to baseline. Suppression, unhealthy habits, and a longer average daily time of thinking about the pandemic were correlated with a relative increase of symptoms. INTERPRETATION: Our findings provide insight into the longitudinal changes of symptoms of psychological distress along the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Furthermore, we were able to reaffirm the anticipated protective and risk factors that were extracted from previous studies and recommendations.","Bendau, Antonia; Plag, Jens; Kunas, Stefanie; Wyka, Sarah; Ströhle, Andreas; Petzold, Moritz Bruno",Brain Behav,543,20

ULs can cause excessive bleeding, pain and infertility1, and are a common cause of hysterectomy2. They emerge through at least three distinct genetic drivers: mutations in MED12 or FH, or genomic rearrangement of HMGA23. Here we created genome-wide datasets, using DNA, RNA, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and HiC chromatin immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) sequencing of primary tissues to profoundly understand the genesis of UL. We identified somatic mutations in genes encoding six members of the SRCAP histone-loading complex4, and found that germline mutations in the SRCAP members YEATS4 and ZNHIT1 predispose women to UL. Tumours bearing these mutations showed defective deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z. In ULs, H2A.Z occupancy correlated positively with chromatin accessibility and gene expression, and negatively with DNA methylation, but these correlations were weak in tumours bearing SRCAP complex mutations. In these tumours, open chromatin emerged at transcription start sites where H2A.Z was lost, which was associated with upregulation of genes. Furthermore, YEATS4 defects were associated with abnormal upregulation of bivalent embryonic stem cell genes, as previously shown in mice5. Our work describes a potential mechanism of tumorigenesis-epigenetic instability caused by deficient H2A.Z deposition-and suggests that ULs arise through an aberrant differentiation program driven by deranged chromatin, emanating from a small number of mutually exclusive driver mutations.","Berta, Davide G; Kuisma, Heli; Välimäki, Niko; Räisänen, Maritta; Jäntti, Maija; Pasanen, Annukka; Karhu, Auli; Kaukomaa, Jaana; Taira, Aurora; Cajuso, Tatiana; Nieminen, Sanna; Penttinen, Rosa-Maria; Ahonen, Saija; Lehtonen, Rainer; Mehine, Miika; Vahteristo, Pia; Jalkanen, Jyrki; Sahu, Biswajyoti; Ravantti, Janne; Mäkinen, Netta; Rajamäki, Kristiina; Palin, Kimmo; Taipale, Jussi; Heikinheimo, Oskari; Bützow, Ralf; Kaasinen, Eevi; Aaltonen, Lauri A",Nature (Lond.),543,15

This seroreactivity was evenly distributed across age and sex, correlated with circulating coronaviruses' reactivity, and was partially outcompeted by soluble circulating coronaviruses' spike. Using a custom SARS-CoV-2 peptide mapping array, we found that this antibody reactivity broadly mapped to spike and to conserved nonstructural viral proteins. We conclude that most adults display preexisting antibody cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2, which further supports investigation of how this may impact the clinical severity of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses.","Majdoubi, Abdelilah; Michalski, Christina; O039,; Connell, Sarah E; Dada, Sarah; Narpala, Sandeep; Gelinas, Jean; Mehta, Disha; Cheung, Claire; Winkler, Dirk Fh; Basappa, Manjula; Liu, Aaron C; Görges, Matthias; Barakauskas, Vilte E; Irvine, Mike; Mehalko, Jennifer; Esposito, Dominic; Sekirov, Inna; Jassem, Agatha N; Goldfarb, David M; Pelech, Steven; Douek, Daniel C; McDermott, Adrian B; Lavoie, Pascal M",JCI insight,543,8

The PPE being used in neurosurgical operations is not designed for use with specialist equipment (82% of respondents reported having to remove PPE to use the microscope) and the reported physical difficulties using PPE intraoperatively could significantly impact on both neurosurgeon performance and patient outcomes. This requires urgent attention by NHS procurement and management and should be urgently escalated to trust occupational health authorities as a workplace safety concern.","Finn, Roisin; Ganau, Mario; Jenkinson, Michael D; Plaha, Puneet",Br J Neurosurg,543,16

Addressing these challenges will require fundamental changes to public health data systems. For example, one of the core data systems for immunization campaigns is the immunization information system (IIS); however, IISs were designed for tracking the vaccinated, not finding the patients who are high risk and need to be vaccinated. Health systems have this data in their electronic health records (EHR) systems and often have a greater capacity for outreach. Clearly, a partnership is needed. However, successful collaborations will require public health to change from its historical hierarchical information supply chain model to an ecosystem model with a peer-to-peer exchange with population health providers. Examples of the types of informatics innovations necessary to support such an ecosystem include a national patient identifier, population-level data exchange for immunization data, and computable electronic quality measures. Rather than think of these components individually, a comprehensive approach to rapidly adaptable tools for collaboration is needed.","Lenert, Leslie A; Ding, Wei; Jacobs, Jeff",J. am. med. inform. assoc,543,1

To the best of our knowledge, the association between severe COVID-19 and dermatologic comorbidities has not been reported yet. In this study, we aimed to describe the dermatologic comorbidities of patients with severe COVID-19 and compare it with the control group. Patients who have died at Usak Training and Research Hospital due to COVID-19 and other diseases in the COVID-19 Intensive Care Units and Internal Medicine Intensive Care Units were recruited into the study. Two groups were compared with each other regarding the most common dermatologic comorbidities. A total of 198 patients including 111 patients with COVID-19 and 87 age and sex-matched patients with other diseases were enrolled in the study. The most common dermatologic comorbidities were pruritus (8.1%), eczema (6.3%), skin infections (3.6%), leukocytoclastic vasculitis (1.8%), and urticaria (0.9%) in the COVID-19 group while they were skin infections (9.2%), eczema (3.4%), pruritus (2.3%), and urticaria (1.1%) in the control group. None of patients in the control group had leukocytoclastic vasculitis. There were no significant differences between COVID-19 and control groups in terms of pruritus, eczema, skin infections, and urticaria (P values were .117, .517, .181, .505, and 1.000, respectively). In conclusion, although it is not statistically significant, it appears that pruritus and leukocytoclastic vasculitis are more common in severe COVID-19 patients. These cytokines-related diseases in the immuno-cutaneous systems may give some clues on the COVID-19 severity. Further studies are required to elucidate the relationship between the immuno-cutaneous system and COVID-19 severity.","Kutlu, Ömer; Ögüt, Neslihan Demirel; Erbagci, Ece; Metin, Ahmet",Dermatol Ther,543,1

OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in Europe. METHODS: Patients with positive diagnosis of COVID-19 were recruited from 18 European hospitals. Epidemiological and clinical data were obtained through a standardized questionnaire. Bayesian analysis was used for analysing the relationship between outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1,420 patients completed the study (962 females, 30.7% of healthcare workers). The mean age of patients was 39.17 ± 12.09 years. The most common symptoms were headache (70.3%), loss of smell (70.2%), nasal obstruction (67.8%), cough (63.2%), asthenia (63.3%), myalgia (62.5%), rhinorrhea (60.1%), gustatory dysfunction (54.2%) and sore throat (52.9%). Fever was reported by 45.4%. The mean duration of COVID-19 symptoms of mild-to-moderate cured patients was 11.5 ± 5.7 days. The prevalence of symptoms significantly varied according to age and sex. Young patients more frequently had ear, nose and throat complaints, whereas elderly individuals often presented fever, fatigue and loss of appetite. Loss of smell, headache, nasal obstruction and fatigue were more prevalent in female patients. The loss of smell was a key symptom of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients and was not associated with nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea. Loss of smell persisted at least 7 days after the disease in 37.5% of cured patients. CONCLUSION: The clinical presentation of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 substantially varies according to the age and the sex characteristics of patients. Olfactory dysfunction seems to be an important underestimated symptom of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 that needs to be recognized as such by the WHO.","Lechien, Jerome R; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M; Place, Sammy; Van Laethem, Yves; Cabaraux, Pierre; Mat, Quentin; Huet, Kathy; Plzak, Jan; Horoi, Mihaela; Hans, Stéphane; Rosaria Barillari, Maria; Cammaroto, Giovanni; Fakhry, Nicolas; Martiny, Delphine; Ayad, Tareck; Jouffe, Lionel; Hopkins, Claire; Saussez, Sven",J Intern Med,543,20

Quarantine of exposed persons (contacts) for 14 days following their exposure reduces transmission (4-7). Contact tracing provides an opportunity to identify contacts, inform them of quarantine recommendations, and monitor their symptoms to promptly identify secondary COVID-19 cases (7,8). On March 12, 2020, Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) identified the first case of COVID-19 in the state. Because of resource constraints, including staffing, Maine CDC could not consistently monitor contacts, and automated technological solutions for monitoring contacts were explored. On May 14, 2020, Maine CDC began enrolling contacts of patients with reported COVID-19 into Sara Alert (MITRE Corporation, 2020),* an automated, web-based, symptom monitoring tool. After initial communication with Maine CDC staff members, enrolled contacts automatically received daily symptom questionnaires via their choice of e-mailed weblink, text message, texted weblink, or telephone call until completion of their quarantine. Epidemiologic investigations were conducted for enrollees who reported symptoms or received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. During May 14-June 26, Maine CDC enrolled 1,622 contacts of 614 COVID-19 patients; 190 (11.7%) eventually developed COVID-19, highlighting the importance of identifying, quarantining, and monitoring contacts of COVID-19 patients to limit spread. In Maine, symptom monitoring was not feasible without the use of an automated symptom monitoring tool. Using a tool that permitted enrollees to specify a method of symptom monitoring was well received, because the majority of persons monitored (96.4%) agreed to report using this system.","Krueger, Anna; Gunn, Jayleen K L; Watson, Joanna; Smith, Andrew E; Lincoln, Rebecca; Huston, Sara L; Dirlikov, Emilio; Robinson, Sara",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,543,23

However, it is increasingly appreciated that healthcare-associated infections derive from both community and healthcare environments, and that the primary sites of C. difficile transmission may be strain-dependent. We conducted a multisite genomic epidemiology study to assess differential genomic evidence of healthcare vs community spread for two of the most common C. difficile strains in the USA: sequence type (ST) 1 (associated with ribotype 027) and ST2 (associated with ribotype 014/020). We performed whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses on 382 ST1 and ST2 C. difficile isolates recovered from stool specimens collected during standard clinical care at 3 geographically distinct US medical centres between 2010 and 2017. ST1 and ST2 isolates both displayed some evidence of phylogenetic clustering by study site, but clustering was stronger and more apparent in ST1, consistent with our healthcare-based study more comprehensively sampling local transmission of ST1 compared to ST2 strains. Analyses of pairwise single-nucleotide variant (SNV) distance distributions were also consistent with more evidence of healthcare transmission of ST1 compared to ST2, with 44â% of ST1 isolates being within two SNVs of another isolate from the same geographical collection site compared to 5.5â% of ST2 isolates (P-value=<0.001). Conversely, ST2 isolates were more likely to have close genetic neighbours across disparate geographical sites compared to ST1 isolates, further supporting non-healthcare routes of spread for ST2 and highlighting the potential for misattributing genomic similarity among ST2 isolates to recent healthcare transmission. Finally, we estimated a lower evolutionary rate for the ST2 lineage compared to the ST1 lineage using Bayesian timed phylogenomic analyses, and hypothesize that this may contribute to observed differences in geographical concordance among closely related isolates. Together, these findings suggest that ST1 and ST2, while both common causes of C. difficile infection in hospitals, show differential reliance on community and hospital spread. This conclusion supports the need for strain-specific criteria for interpreting genomic linkages and emphasizes the importance of considering differences in the epidemiology of circulating strains when devising interventions to reduce the burden of C. difficile infections.","Miles-Jay, Arianna; Young, Vincent B; Pamer, Eric G; Savidge, Tor C; Kamboj, Mini; Garey, Kevin W; Snitkin, Evan S",Microb. genom,543,16

This study aims to analyze the universities in India utilizing e-resources through the INFED facility. It seeks to analyze region-wise, category-wise and state-wise access of INFED by different universities across the country. Data was collected directly from the INFED website. A total of 171 institutions were identified as member institutions in INFED till 1stFebruary 2021.Out of these 171 member institutions, 101 institutions identified as universities were taken for the present study. It is surprising to note that only 10.44% of the Indian universities are using the INFED facility. The lion’s share of universities (89.56%) is not using the INFED technology. INFED accessing universities were also broken down by region and category wise and it is found that universities in the South (38.61 %) and North (32.67%) are more accessing than universities in other regions and regarding the category-wise analysis, state universities (45.54 %) are accessing more. The region-wise university analysis shows that despite the fact that the number of universities is higher in Northern region (336) than Southern region (201), the higher the number of universities joined in INFED is from Southern region (4.03%). Tamil Nadu (14.85 %) and Karnataka (12.87 %) states have more INFED accessing universities and furthermore these states are located in the Southern zone.

We analyzed the expression levels of ACE2 in the Oncomine and TIMER databases, the correlation between ACE2 and overall survival in the PrognoScan, GEPIA and Kaplan-Meier plotter databases. The correlation between ACE2 and immune infiltration level and the type markers of immune cells was investigated in TIMER database. A prognosis analysis based on the expression levels of ACE2 was further performed in related immune cells subgroup. The ACE2 promoter methylation profile was tested in the UALCAN database. In addition, we used GSE30589 and GSE52920 databases to elucidate the changes of ACE2 expression in vivo and in vitro after SARS-CoV infection. ACE2 was elevated in UCEC and KIRP, and high ACE2 had a favorable prognosis. The expression of ACE2 was positively correlated with the level of immune infiltration of macrophage in KIRP, B cell, CD4+T cell, neutrophil and dendritic cell immune infiltration levels in UCEC. ACE2 was significantly positively correlated with the type markers of B cells and neutrophils, macrophages in UCEC, while ACE2 in KIRP was positively correlated with the type markers of macrophages. High ACE2 expression level had a favorable prognosis in different enriched immune cells subgroups in UCEC and KIRP. And the promoter methylation levels of ACE2 in UCEC and KIRP were significantly reduced. What's more, we found that the expression of ACE2 decreased in vivo and in vitro after SARS-CoV infection. In conclusion, ACE2 expression increased significantly in UCEC and KIRP, elevated ACE2 was positively correlated with immune infiltration and prognosis. Moreover, tumor tissues may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients with UCEC and KIRP, which may worsen the prognosis.","Yang, Jing; Li, Hongxia; Hu, Shengda; Zhou, Yafeng",Aging (Albany NY),543,16

This paper proposes a retrospective analysis of the evolution of labour resources in Romania, after joining the European Union. The methodology used combines descriptive statistical analysis (labour resources, activity rate, employment rate, unemployment rate, average net earnings), hierarchical cluster analysis to compare the employment situation in Romania in the year of accession to the European Union (2007) versus the year before the onset of the pandemic crisis (2019) and the simple linear regression analysis, having as an independent variable the „unemployment rate"" and as a dependent variable „the number of employees"". Simple linear regression is used not only for teaching purposes, but in addition to testing the link between variables, we wanted to find out how much the number of employees decreases if the unemployment rate increases by one percentage point nationwide.

Multiple large reports of CCP treatment in adults exist. Pediatric data on CCP safety and efficacy are limited. METHODS: Single-center prospective, open-label trial looking at safety, antibody kinetics and outcomes of CCP (10 mL/kg, max 1 unit) treatment for COVID-19 in hospitalized pediatric patients with moderate to severe disease or at high-risk for serious illness. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled. No infusion-related adverse events occurred. No hematologic or metabolic adverse events were noted during hospitalization or at 3-weeks. Ten patients had clinical improvement by day 7 (WHO eight-category ordinal severity scale for COVID-19). Following CCP, anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid IgG increased significantly at 24 hours and high levels were sustained at 7- and 21-days. Transient IgM response was noted. Twelve patients (92.3%) were discharged home, 9 (75%) by day 7 post-CCP. One remained on invasive ventilatory support 42 days after CCP and was eventually discharged to an intermediate care facility. The single patient death was retrospectively confirmed to have had brain death before CCP. CONCLUSION: CCP was well tolerated in pediatric patients, resulted in rapid antibody increase, and did not appear to interfere with immune responses measured at 21 days. More pediatric data are necessary to establish the efficacy of CCP, but our data suggest benefit in moderate to severe COVID-19 when used early. Other immunologic or antiviral interventions may be added as supported by emerging data.","Arrieta, Antonio; Galvis, Alvaro E; Morphew, Tricia; Ehwerhemuepha, Louis; Osborne, Stephanie; Enriquez, Claudia; Imfeld, Karen; Hoang, Janet; Nieves, Delma; Ashouri, Negar; Singh, Jasjit; Nugent, Diane",Pediatr Infect Dis J,543,21

Characterizing the viral concentration and modelling the viral transmission are, therefore, considered major milestones for enhancing viral detection capabilities. This paper addresses the problem of viral aerosol detection based on the exhaled breath in a bounded environment, e.g., a bounded room. The paper models the exhaled breath as a cloud which is emitted through the room continuously, and analyzes the temporal-spatial virus concentration by accounting for partial absorption and reflection at each side of the room. The paper first derives a closed form expression of the temporal-spatial virus concentration. It then considers the deployment of a receiver composed of an air sampler and a bio-sensor to detect the viral existence of a specific virus. We, therefore, assess the detection capabilities of the proposed system via evaluating the viral miss-detection probability as a function of the sampling volume and the detection time-instance at the receiver side. Our numerical simulations verify the validity of the analytical results, and illustrate the ability of the proposed system to detect viruses in indoor environments. The results further characterize the impacts of several system parameters on the miss-detection probability.","Amin, Osama; Dahrouj, Hayssam; Almayouf, Nojood; Al-Naffouri, Tareq Y.; Shihada, Basem; Alouini, Mohamed-Slim",,543,13

The Italian case,14.132307,0.044333912,2020,"BACKGROUND: During pandemics, healthcare workers (HCWs) may be prone to higher levels of anxiety than those of the general population. This study aimed to explore the anxiety levels among HCWs in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic and the predictors of increased anxiety levels. METHOD: HCW participants in this cross-section study were solicited by email from the database of registered practitioners of the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties between 15 May and 18 May 2020. Sociodemographic characteristics, work-related factors, and organization-related factors were collected. RESULTS: Four thousand nine hundred and twenty HCWs (3.4%) responded. Reported levels of anxiety were low anxiety (31.5%; n = 1552), medium (36.1%; n = 1778), and high (32.3%; n = 1590). Participants reporting high anxiety levels were more likely to be unmarried (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.14-1.52); nurses (OR = 1.54, 95% 1.24-1.91); workers in radiology (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.01-2.28); or respiratory therapists (OR = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.14-4.54). Social factors associated with high anxiety levels were: living with a person who is elderly (p = 0.01), has a chronic disease (p < 0.0001), has immune deficiency (p < 0.0001), or has a respiratory disease (p-value <0.0001). Organization-related factors associated with a high level of anxiety were: working in an organization that hosts COVID-19 patients and working with such patients (p-value <0.0001). CONCLUSION: Self-reported medium and high levels of anxiety were present in 68.5% of HCWs in the COVID-19 pandemic. This highlights the urgent need to identify high-risk individuals to offer psychological support and provide up to date information on the pandemic. These data should help policymakers drive initiatives forward to protect and prepare HCWs psychological wellbeing.","Alenazi, Thamer H; BinDhim, Nasser F; Alenazi, Meteb H; Tamim, Hani; Almagrabi, Reem S; Aljohani, Sameera M; H Basyouni, Mada; Almubark, Rasha A; Althumiri, Nora A; Alqahtani, Saleh A",J Infect Public Health,543,5

This powerful but simple concept is widely used by the public media, scientists, and political decision makers to explain and justify political strategies to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we explore the effectiveness of political interventions using the reproduction number of COVID-19 across Europe. We propose a dynamic SEIR epidemiology model with a time-varying reproduction number, which we identify using machine learning. During the early outbreak, the basic reproduction number was 4.22 ± 1.69, with maximum values of 6.33 and 5.88 in Germany and the Netherlands. By May 10, 2020, it dropped to 0.67 ± 0.18, with minimum values of 0.37 and 0.28 in Hungary and Slovakia. We found a strong correlation between passenger air travel, driving, walking, and transit mobility and the effective reproduction number with a time delay of 17.24 ± 2.00 days. Our new dynamic SEIR model provides the flexibility to simulate various outbreak control and exit strategies to inform political decision making and identify safe solutions in the benefit of global health.","Linka, Kevin; Peirlinck, Mathias; Kuhl, Ellen",Comput Mech,543,32

The present analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg versus empagliflozin 25 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy from a healthcare payer perspective in the UK. METHODS: Outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects of initiation of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg were based on an indirect comparison conducted using patient-level data, as there is currently no head-to-head clinical trial comparing these therapies. Modelled patients received treatments until glycated haemoglobin exceeded 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), at which point patients initiated basal insulin. The analysis captured pharmacy costs and costs of diabetes-related complications, expressed in 2019 pounds sterling (GBP). Projected outcomes were discounted at 3.5% annually. Scenario analyses were prepared to assess uncertainty around projected outcomes. RESULTS: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was associated with increases in life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.12 years and 0.23 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively, compared with empagliflozin 25 mg. Projected improvements in quality and duration of life resulted from a reduced cumulative incidence and a delayed time to onset of diabetes-related complications. Once-weekly semaglutide was associated with increased pharmacy costs, but this was partially offset by avoided costs of treating complications. Once-weekly semaglutide was associated with an increase in costs of GBP 1017 per patient, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 4439 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was projected to be a cost-effective treatment option from a healthcare payer perspective compared with empagliflozin 25 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK setting.","Capehorn, Matthew; Hallén, Nino; Baker-Knight, James; Glah, Divina; Hunt, Barnaby",,543,26

This is particularly true in the field of neuro-oncology, where the perceived benefit of therapeutic interventions is often low, although this notion is partially incorrect. We acknowledge that the recommendations for care of patients with cancer have become a moving target and that all recommendations are subject to modification based on national and institutional regulations. Still, some important considerations and proposals may apply broadly. First, it is important to note that old age and cardiovascular and pulmonary co-morbidities are the major risk factors for experiencing a severe course of and for dying of COVID-19, not chronic immunosuppression and cancer. Second, many of the considerations on how we should adapt clinical practice in neuro-oncology in view of COVID-19 that are now dominating discussions at local tumour boards, as well as on the institutional level and within societies of neuro-oncology, are not novel but have been valid before and only now have become a priority. More than ever, it seems to be mandatory to adhere to evidence-based medicine and not to prescribe potentially toxic, notably immunsuppresssive systemic therapy where evidence for efficacy is low. Furthermore, it is more obvious now that oncologists must not miss the right time for advance care planning, that is, supporting patients in understanding and sharing their personal values, life goals and preferences regarding future medical care. The major psychological impact of transforming oncology care to teleconferences and videoconferences and of the important strict recommendation of social distancing must not be overlooked in a patient population that is characterised by significant prevalence of cognitive decline and by the general perception that their life span may not exceed the life span of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Weller, Michael; Preusser, Matthias",,543,20

Multiple clinical trials are currently underway to assess effectiveness of the vaccine in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the durability and mechanism of BCG trained immunity remain unclear. Here, an integrative analysis of available epidemiological transcriptomic data related to BCG vaccination and respiratory tract viral infections as well as of reported transcriptomic alterations in COVID-19 is presented toward addressing this gap. Results suggest that the vaccine induces very long-lasting transcriptomic changes that mimic viral infections by, consistent with the present concept of trained immunity, upregulation of antiviral defense response, and oppose viral infections by, inconsistent with the concept, downregulation of myeloid cell activation. These durability and mechanistic insights argue against possible indiscriminate use of the vaccine and activated innate immune response associated safety concerns in COVID-19, in that order.","Sharma, Abhay",Gene,543,1

Here we report two sensitive and automated testing-on-a-probe (TOP) biosensor assays for SARS-CoV-2 viral specific total antibodies (TAb) and surrogate neutralizing antibodies (SNAb), which are suitable for clinical use. The TOP assays employ an RBD-coated quartz probe using a Cy5-Streptavidin-polysacharide conjugate to improve sensitivity and minimize interference. Disposable cartridges containing pre-dispensed reagents require no liquid manipulation or fluidics during testing. The TOP-TAb assay exhibited higher sensitivity in the 0-7 DAOS window than a widely used FDA-EUA assay. The rapid and automated TOP-SNAb correlated well with two well-established SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization tests. The clinical utility of the TOP assays was demonstrated by evaluating early antibody responses in 120 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive adult hospitalized patients. Higher TAb and SNAb positivity rates and more robust antibody responses at patient's initial hospital presentation were seen in inpatients who survived COVID-19 than those who died in the hospital. Survival analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model showed that patients who had negative TAb and/or SNAb at initial hospital presentation were at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, TAb and SNAb levels at presentation were inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load based on concurrent RT-PCR testing. Overall, the sensitive and automated TAb and SNAb assays allow the detection of early SARS-CoV-2 antibodies which associate with mortality.","Yang, He S; Racine-Brzostek, Sabrina E; Karbaschi, Mohsen; Yee, Jim; Dillard, Alicia; Steel, Peter A D; Lee, William T; McDonough, Kathleen A; Qiu, Yuqing; Ketas, Thomas J; Francomano, Erik; Klasse, P J; Hatem, Layla; Westblade, Lars; Wu, Heng; Chen, Haode; Zuk, Robert; Tan, Hong; Girardin, Roxanne C; Dupuis, Alan P; Payne, Anne F; Moore, John P; Cushing, Melissa M; Chadburn, Amy; Zhao, Zhen",Biosens Bioelectron,543,23

The feasibility of using this technology was examined by assessing client engagement. METHODS: The authors created and implemented procedures for the clinic's transition to telemental health. Once clients' consent was obtained, a HIPAA compliant platform was used to continue service provision. RESULTS: Client engagement during this period improved compared to the same quarter the previous year. Telemental health was also practical for providing groups and other supportive services to meet clients' needs. CONCLUSION: Telemental health is an effective approach to providing care at an FEP clinic during a pandemic. Successes and lessons learned from the first wave of the pandemic can be used to prevent an uptick in symptoms and sustain engagement for this vulnerable population during the anticipated second wave.","Chaudhry, Serena; Weiss, Ashley; Dillon, Grinasha; O039,; Shea, Ariana; Hansel, Tonya Cross",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,543,16

Key to this influence is lyrics and their meaning in conjunction with the acoustic properties of the track. Recent work has focused on analysing these acoustic properties and showing that individuals prone to depression primarily consume low valence and low energy music. However, no studies yet have explored lyrical content preferences in relation to online music consumption of such individuals. In the current study, we examine lyrical simplicity, measured as the Compressibility and Absolute Information Content of the text, associated with preferences of individuals at risk for depression. Using the six-month listening history of 541 Last.fm users, we compare lyrical simplicity trends for users grouped as being at risk (At-Risk) of depression from those that are not (No-Risk). Our findings reveal that At-Risk individuals prefer songs with greater information content (lower Compressibility) on average, especially for songs characterised as Sad. Furthermore, we found that At-Risk individuals also have greater variability of Absolute Information Content across their listening history. We discuss the results in light of existing socio-psychological lab-based research on music habits associated with depression and their relevance to naturally occurring online music listening behaviour.","Shriram, Jaidev; Paruchuri, Sreeharsha; Alluri, Vinoo",,543,1

METHODS: The investigation analyzed pre- and post-COVID-19 characteristics in 191 opioid use disorder (OUD) buprenorphine outpatients who completed an 18-question survey in late 2020 related to COVID testing, OUD relapses, obstacles to maintaining abstinence, and treatment resources. RESULTS: The study revealed no statistically significant changes in drug use before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic despite monthly volume increases. Results further demonstrated statistically significant barriers to treatment, including loss of housing and transportation, food insecurity, and onset of depression. No patients required hospitalization or succumbed to OUD or COVID-19. Potentially effective resource utilization findings included clinic transportation and 24/7 crisis intervention. Respondents rated telehealth as helpful when used in an individualized hybrid model matching patient's need to available resources based on COVID-19 safety guidelines. CONCLUSION: This report yields key clinical insights into providing outpatient MOUD care during the COVID-19 pandemic, validating in-person care as both safe and effective. Patients' experiences proved helpful in identifying and quantifying obstacles to abstinence in conjunction with facilitating continued patient access to essential clinical resources. Notably, telehealth can supplement rather than replace in-person treatment.","Cales, Richard H; Cales, Shannon C; Shreffler, Jacob; Huecker, Martin R",J Subst Abuse Treat,543,1

Blood samples were collected before inoculation and at day post-inoculation (dpi) 3, 6, 9 and 12 and tested for the presence of PRRSV antibody and RNA, PCV2 antibody and DNA, complete blood counts, and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) levels. Regardless of concurrent PCV2 infection, VR-2385 initially replicated at higher levels and reached peak replication levels at dpi 6. Pigs infected with VR-2385 had significantly higher amounts of viral RNA in serum on both dpi 3 and dpi 6, compared to pigs infected with NC16845b. The peak of NC16845b virus replication occurred between dpi 9 and dpi 12 and was associated with a delayed anti-PRRSV antibody response in these pigs. PCV2 coinfection resulted in significantly more severe macroscopic and microscopic lung lesions and a stronger anti-PRRSV IgG response compared to pigs infected with PRRSV alone. This work further emphasizes in vivo replication differences among PRRSV strains and the importance of coinfecting pathogens.","Opriessnig, Tanja; Gauger, Phillip C.; Faaberg, Kay S.; Shen, Huigang; Beach, Nathan M.; Meng, Xiang-Jin; Wang, Chong; Halbur, Patrick G.",Vet Microbiol,543,26

A mixed-methods research approach was adopted and the analysis involved the use of textual analysis software and statistical techniques including descriptive statistics and the PLS-SEM program, Warp-PLS. Such findings as an intolerance of growing queues, dim lighting and poor or little interpretation represent challenges for Museum management. The paper then identifies the role of the perceived value of the visit to the Museum as a determinant of satisfaction, and proceeds to describe the actions taken by Museum management to enhance visitor satisfaction. This involved a significant introduction of hi-tech presentational values, more web-based ticketing (so permitting better control over crowding) and web-based souvenir purchasing – so moving the Museum closer to best international practice.","Chen, Hui; Ryan, Chris",Journal of Destination Marketing & Management,543,16

In order to rapidly characterize the spread of this and other emerging VOCs and variants of interest (VOIs), NGS-SA partnered with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the African Society of Laboratory Medicine through the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative to strengthen SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance across the region. Here, we report the first genomic surveillance results from Angola, which has had 21 500 reported cases and around 500 deaths from COVID-19 up to March 2021 (Supplemental Fig S1). On 15 January 2021, in response to the international spread of VOCs, the government instituted compulsory rapid antigen testing of all passengers arriving at the main international airport, in addition to the existing requirement to present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of travel. All individuals with a positive antigen test are isolated in a government facility for a minimum of 14 days and require two negative RT-PCR tests at least 48 hours apart for de-isolation, whilst all travelers with a negative test on arrival proceed to mandatory self-quarantine for 10 days followed by a repeat test. In March 2021, we received 118 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected between June 2020 and February 2021, a number of which were from incoming air travelers (Supplemental Fig S1). From these, we produced 73 high quality genomes (>80% coverage), 14 of which were known VOCs/VOIs (seven 501Y.V2/B.1.351, six B.1.1.7, one B.1.525), 44 of which were C.16 (a common lineage circulating in Portugal), and twelve of which were other lineages (Supplemental Fig S2). In addition, we detected a new VOI in three incoming travelers from Tanzania who were tested together at the airport in mid-February. The three genomes from these passengers were almost identical and presented highly divergent sequences within the A lineage (Figure 1A & 1B). The GISAID database contains nine other sequences reported to be sampled from cases involving travel from Tanzania, two of which are basal to the three sampled in Angola (Figure 1A, Supplemental Table S1). This new VOI, temporarily designated A.VOI.V2, has 31 amino acid substitutions (11 in spike) and three deletions (all in spike) (Figure 1C & 1D). The spike mutations include three substitutions in the receptor-binding domain (R346K, T478R and E484K); five substitutions and three deletions in the N-terminal domain, some of which are within the antigenic supersite (Y144{Delta}, R246M, SYL247-249{Delta} and W258L)4; and two substitutions adjacent to the S1/S2 cleavage site (H655Y and P681H). Several of these mutations are present in other VOCs/VOIs and are evolving under positive selection.","de Oliveira, T.; Lutucuta, S.; Nkengasong, J.; Morais, J.; Paula Paixao, J.; Neto, Z.; Afonso, P.; Miranda, J.; David, K.; Ingles, L.; Carralero, A.

The k-mode algorithm, proposed since 1998, and its multiple variants were widely used in this context. However, they suffer from a great limitation related to the update of the modes in each iteration. The mode in the last step of these algorithms is randomly selected although it is possible to identify many candidate ones. In this paper, a rough density mode selection method is proposed to identify the adequate modes among a list of candidate ones in each iteration of the k-modes. The proposed method, called Density Rough k-Modes (DRk-M) was experimented using real world datasets extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and a set of collected Tweets. The DRk-M was also compared to many states of the art clustering methods and has shown great efficiency.","Salem, Semeh Ben; Naouali, Sami; Chtourou, Zied",Int J Mach Learn Cybern,543,30

Complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults but has not been studied in the pediatric population. We hypothesized that complement activation plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and sought to understand if TMA was present in these patients. We enrolled 50 hospitalized pediatric patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 21, minimal coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]; n = 11, severe COVID-19) or MIS-C (n = 18). As a biomarker of complement activation and TMA, soluble C5b9 (sC5b9, normal 247 ng/mL) was measured in plasma, and elevations were found in patients with minimal disease (median, 392 ng/mL; interquartile range [IQR], 244-622 ng/mL), severe disease (median, 646 ng/mL; IQR, 203-728 ng/mL), and MIS-C (median, 630 ng/mL; IQR, 359-932 ng/mL) compared with 26 healthy control subjects (median, 57 ng/mL; IQR, 9-163 ng/mL; P < .001). Higher sC5b9 levels were associated with higher serum creatinine (P = .01) but not age. Of the 19 patients for whom complete clinical criteria were available, 17 (89%) met criteria for TMA. A high proportion of tested children with SARS-CoV-2 infection had evidence of complement activation and met clinical and diagnostic criteria for TMA. Future studies are needed to determine if hospitalized children with SARS-CoV-2 should be screened for TMA, if TMA-directed management is helpful, and if there are any short- or long-term clinical consequences of complement activation and endothelial damage in children with COVID-19 or MIS-C.","Diorio, Caroline; McNerney, Kevin O.; Lambert, Michele; Paessler, Michele; Anderson, Elizabeth M.; Henrickson, Sarah E.; Chase, Julie; Liebling, Emily J.; Burudpakdee, Chakkapong; Lee, Jessica H.; Balamuth, Frances B.; Blatz, Allison M.; Chiotos, Kathleen; Fitzgerald, Julie C.; Giglia, Therese M.; Gollomp, Kandace; Odom John, Audrey R.; Jasen, Cristina; Leng, Tomas; Petrosa, Whitney; Vella, Laura A.; Witmer, Char; Sullivan, Kathleen E.; Laskin, Benjamin L.; Hensley, Scott E.; Bassiri, Hamid; Behrens, Edward M.; Teachey, David T.",Blood Adv,543,5
