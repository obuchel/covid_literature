279,Insertion/Deletion Polymorphism of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Gene in Kawasaki Disease,2006-04-20,"Polymorphism of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene is reported to be associated with ischemic heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Kawasaki disease and insertion/deletion polymorphism of ACE gene. Fifty five Kawasaki disease patients and 43 healthy children were enrolled. ACE genotype was evaluated from each of the subjects' DNA fragments through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Frequencies of ACE genotypes (DD, ID, II) were 12.7%, 60.0%, 27.3% in Kawasaki group, and 41.9%, 30.2%, 27.9% in control group respectively, indicating low rate of DD and high rate of ID genotype among Kawasaki patients (p<0.01). Comparing allelic (I, D) frequencies, I allele was more prevalent in Kawasaki group than in control group (57.3% vs. 43.0%, p<0.05). In Kawasaki group, both genotype and allelic frequencies were not statistically different between those with coronary dilatations and those without. ACE gene I/D polymorphism is thought to be associated with Kawasaki disease but not with the development of coronary dilatations.","Shim, Yoon Hee; Kim, Hae Soon; Sohn, Sejung; Hong, Young Mi",J Korean Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2733992/,133
297,"Initial psychological responses to Influenza A, H1N1 (""Swine flu"")",2009-10-06,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the pandemic flu, Influenza A H1N1 (Swine Flu) in early 2009, provided a major challenge to health services around the world. Previous pandemics have led to stockpiling of goods, the victimisation of particular population groups, and the cancellation of travel and the boycotting of particular foods (e.g. pork). We examined initial behavioural and attitudinal responses towards Influenza A, H1N1 (""Swine flu"") in the six days following the WHO pandemic alert level 5, and regional differences in these responses. METHODS: 328 respondents completed a cross-sectional Internet or paper-based questionnaire study in Malaysia (N = 180) or Europe (N = 148). Measures assessed changes in transport usage, purchase of preparatory goods for a pandemic, perceived risk groups, indicators of anxiety, assessed estimated mortality rates for seasonal flu, effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccination, and changes in pork consumption RESULTS: 26% of the respondents were 'very concerned' about being a flu victim (42% Malaysians, 5% Europeans, p < .001). 36% reported reduced public transport use (48% Malaysia, 22% Europe, p < .001), 39% flight cancellations (56% Malaysia, 17% Europe, p < .001). 8% had purchased preparatory materials (e.g. face masks: 8% Malaysia, 7% Europe), 41% Malaysia (15% Europe) intended to do so (p < .001). 63% of Europeans, 19% of Malaysians had discussed the pandemic with friends (p < .001). Groups seen as at 'high risk' of infection included the immune compromised (mentioned by 87% respondents), pig farmers (70%), elderly (57%), prostitutes/highly sexually active (53%), and the homeless (53%). In data collected only in Europe, 64% greatly underestimated the mortality rates of seasonal flu, 26% believed seasonal flu vaccination gave protection against swine flu. 7% had reduced/stopped eating pork. 3% had purchased anti-viral drugs for use at home, while 32% intended to do so if the pandemic worsened. CONCLUSION: Initial responses to Influenza A show large regional differences in anxiety, with Malaysians more anxious and more likely to reduce travel and to buy masks and food. Discussions with family and friends may reinforce existing anxiety levels. Particular groups (homosexuals, prostitutes, the homeless) are perceived as at greater risk, potentially leading to increased prejudice during a pandemic. Europeans underestimated mortality of seasonal flu, and require more information about the protection given by seasonal flu inoculation.","Goodwin, Robin; Haque, Shamsul; Neto, Felix; Myers, Lynn B",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2765446/,133
420,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 autoantibodies: further evidence for a role of the renin-angiotensin system in inflammation,2010-06-28,"Traditionally viewed as important in the regulation of blood pressure, the renin-angiotensin system - and specifically the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-angiotensin (Ang) II-AT(1 )receptor axis - may play a prominent role to promote inflammation and fibrosis. ACE2, a new component of the renin-angiotensin system, has emerged as a key enzyme that selectively degrades Ang II and generates Ang-(1-7), a bioactive peptide with anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic actions. Takahashi and colleagues demonstrate circulating titers of inhibitory autoantibodies against ACE2 in patients with systemic sclerosis. The current study reveals a potentially novel mechanism to attenuate the catalytic activity of ACE2, thereby promoting the actions of Ang II.","Chappell, Mark C",Arthritis Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2911909/,133
628,"Poverty, Global Health, and Infectious Disease: Lessons from Haiti and Rwanda",2011-09-06,"Poverty and infectious diseases interact in complex ways. Casting destitution as intractable, or epidemics that afflict the poor as accidental, erroneously exonerates us from responsibility for caring for those most in need. Adequately addressing communicable diseases requires a biosocial appreciation of the structural forces that shape disease patterns. Most health interventions in resource-poor settings could garner support based on cost/benefit ratios with appropriately lengthy time horizons to capture the return on health investments and an adequate accounting of externalities; however, such a calculus masks the suffering of inaction and risks eroding the most powerful incentive to act: redressing inequality.","Alsan, Marcella M.; Westerhaus, Michael; Herce, Michael; Nakashima, Koji; Farmer, Paul E.",Infect Dis Clin North Am,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168775/,133
629,Forecasting incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in China using ARIMA model,2011-08-15,"BACKGROUND: China is a country that is most seriously affected by hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) with 90% of HFRS cases reported globally. At present, HFRS is getting worse with increasing cases and natural foci in China. Therefore, there is an urgent need for monitoring and predicting HFRS incidence to make the control of HFRS more effective. In this study, we applied a stochastic autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model with the objective of monitoring and short-term forecasting HFRS incidence in China. METHODS: Chinese HFRS data from 1975 to 2008 were used to fit ARIMA model. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Ljung-Box test were used to evaluate the constructed models. Subsequently, the fitted ARIMA model was applied to obtain the fitted HFRS incidence from 1978 to 2008 and contrast with corresponding observed values. To assess the validity of the proposed model, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the observed and fitted HFRS incidence (1978-2008) was calculated. Finally, the fitted ARIMA model was used to forecast the incidence of HFRS of the years 2009 to 2011. All analyses were performed using SAS9.1 with a significant level of p < 0.05. RESULTS: The goodness-of-fit test of the optimum ARIMA (0,3,1) model showed non-significant autocorrelations in the residuals of the model (Ljung-Box Q statistic = 5.95,P = 0.3113). The fitted values made by ARIMA (0,3,1) model for years 1978-2008 closely followed the observed values for the same years, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 12.20%. The forecast values from 2009 to 2011 were 0.69, 0.86, and 1.21per 100,000 population, respectively. CONCLUSION: ARIMA models applied to historical HFRS incidence data are an important tool for HFRS surveillance in China. This study shows that accurate forecasting of the HFRS incidence is possible using an ARIMA model. If predicted values from this study are accurate, China can expect a rise in HFRS incidence.","Liu, Qiyong; Liu, Xiaodong; Jiang, Baofa; Yang, Weizhong",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3169483/,133
739,Influenza A/H1N1 septic shock in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. A case report,2011-12-29,"BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised patients, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) sufferers have an increased risk of mortality, following influenza infection. In the recent pandemic, influenza A H1NI virus caused 18449 deaths, mainly because of adult respiratory distress syndrome or bacterial co-infections. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report, an SLE patient with viral-induced septic shock, without overt pulmonary involvement, is discussed. The patient was administered oseltamivir and supportive treatment, including wide-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors and steroids, according to the guidelines proposed for bacterial sepsis and septic shock. She finally survived and experienced a lupus flare soon after intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case to report severe septic shock from influenza A/H1N1 virus, without overt pulmonary involvement.","Tselios, Konstantinos; Tsioka, Ritsa; Sarantopoulos, Alexandros; Mouloudi, Eleni; Boura, Panagiota",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3265447/,133
992,Lower Respiratory Tract Infection in a Renal Transplant Recipient: Do not Forget Metapneumovirus,2012-11-14,"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is emerging as a cause of a severe respiratory tract infection in immunocompromised patients. hMPV pneumonia has only been seldom reported in nonpulmonary solid organ transplanted patients, such as renal transplant recipients. We report here a case of a 39-year-old patient presenting with fever, cough, and interstitial opacities on CT scan diagnosed as a nonsevere hMPV pneumonia 11 years after a renal transplantation. Infection resolved spontaneously. Differential diagnosis with Pneumocystis pneumonia was discussed. We review the medical literature and discuss clinical presentation and detection methods that can be proposed in solid organ transplant recipients.","Noel, N.; Rammaert, B.; Zuber, J.; Sayre, N.; Mamzer-Bruneel, M.

1025,"Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus infection and TNF, LTA, IL1B, IL6, IL8, and CCL polymorphisms in Mexican population: a case–control study",2012-11-13,"BACKGROUND: Some patients have a greater response to viral infection than do others having a similar level of viral replication. Hypercytokinemia is the principal immunopathological mechanism that contributes to a severer clinical course in cases of influenza A/H1N1. The benefit produced, or damage caused, by these cytokines in severe disease is not known. The genes that code for these molecules are polymorphic and certain alleles have been associated with susceptibility to various diseases. The objective of the present study was to determine whether there was an association between polymorphisms of TNF, LTA, IL1B, IL6, IL8, and CCL1 and the infection and severity of the illness caused by the pandemic A/H1N1 in Mexico in 2009. METHODS: Case–control study. The cases were patients confirmed with real time PCR with infection by the A/H1N1 pandemic virus. The controls were patients with infection like to influenza and non-familial healthy contacts of the patients with influenza. Medical history and outcome of the disease was registered. The DNA samples were genotyped for polymorphisms TNF rs361525, rs1800629, and rs1800750; LTA rs909253; IL1B rs16944; IL6 rs1818879; IL8 rs4073; and CCL1 rs2282691. Odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. The logistic regression model was adjusted by age and severity of the illness in cases. RESULTS: Infection with the pandemic A/H1N1 virus was associated with the following genotypes: TNF rs361525 AA, OR = 27.00; 95% CI = 3.07–1248.77); LTA rs909253 AG (OR = 4.33, 95% CI = 1.82–10.32); TNF rs1800750 AA (OR = 4.33, 95% CI = 1.48–12.64); additionally, LTA rs909253 AG showed a limited statistically significant association with mortality (p = 0.06, OR = 3.13). Carriers of the TNF rs1800629 GA genotype were associated with high levels of blood urea nitrogen (p = 0.05); those of the TNF rs1800750 AA genotype, with high levels of creatine phosphokinase (p=0.05). The IL1B rs16944 AA genotype was associated with an elevated number of leukocytes (p <0.001) and the IL8 rs4073 AA genotype, with a higher value for P(a)O(2) mm Hg. CONCLUSION: The polymorphisms of genes involved in the inflammatory process contributed to the severity of the clinical behavior of infection by the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus.","Morales-García, Guadalupe; Falfán-Valencia, Ramcés; García-Ramírez, Román Alejandro; Camarena, Ángel; Ramirez-Venegas, Alejandra; Castillejos-López, Manuel; Pérez-Rodríguez, Martha; González-Bonilla, César; Grajales-Muñíz, Concepción; Borja-Aburto, Víctor; Mejía-Aranguré, Juan Manuel",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3534505/,133
1170,Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis: Clinical characteristics and outcome,2013,"BACKGROUND: ADEM, although relatively uncommon, is probably under-recognized. OBJECTIVES: To spotlight the clinical profile and therapeutic outcome of children with ADEM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective study of patients with ADEM who were admitted to the Pediatric Departments in Aladan and Alfarawanya Hospitals in Kuwait, from January 2009 to January 2011. Clinical, microbiological and radiological data were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 48 patients presented with acute neurological symptoms and signs, 21 patients fulfilled criteria for ADEM. 80.95% of cases were presenting in winter and spring, 57% of patients had a history of upper respiratory tract illness. The commonest presentations were motor deficits, convulsions and altered consciousness. CSF virology studies showed herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (3 patients) whereas nasal and nasopharyngeal swab showed evidence of influenza H1N1 virus (1 patient). Brain MRI was performed in all patients and revealed multiple hyperintense supratentorial brain lesions on T2/FLAIR images. 85.7% of patients had cortical and/or subcortical white matter lesions which were bilateral and asymmetric in location and size. CONCLUSION: ADEM although rare must be considered in children with acute onset of neurological signs and symptoms and must be distinguished from any acute neurological insult.","Elhassanien, Ahmed Farag; Aziz, Hesham Abdel",J Pediatr Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3680891/,133
1229,"Severe leukopenia in Staphylococcus aureus-necrotizing, community-acquired pneumonia: risk factors and impact on survival",2013-08-01,"BACKGROUND: Necrotizing pneumonia attributed to Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive Staphylococcus aureus has mainly been reported in otherwise healthy children and young adults, with a high mortality rate. Erythroderma, airway bleeding, and leukopenia have been shown to be predictive of mortality. The objectives of this study were to define the characteristics of patients with severe leukopenia at 48-h hospitalization and to update our data regarding mortality predicting factors in a larger population than we had previously described. METHODS: It was designed as a case-case study nested in a cohort study. A total of 148 cases of community-acquired, necrotizing pneumonia were included. The following data were collected: basic demographic information, medical history, signs and symptoms, radiological findings and laboratory results during the first 48 h of hospitalization. The study population was divided into 2 groups: (1) with severe leukopenia (leukocyte count ≤3,000 leukocytes/mL, n=62) and (2) without severe leukopenia (>3,000 leukocytes/mL, n=86). RESULTS: Median age was 22 years, and the male-to-female gender ratio was 1.5. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 41.2%. Death occurred in 75.8% of severe leukopenia cases with median survival time of 4 days, and in 16.3% of cases with leukocyte count >3,000/mL (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that the factors associated with severe leukopenia were influenza-like illness (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.45, 95% CI (95% confidence interval) 1.67-11.88, P=0.003), airway bleeding (aOR 4.53, 95% CI 1.85-11.13, P=0.001) and age over 30 years (aOR 2.69, 95% CI 1.08-6.68, P=0.033). A personal history of furuncles appeared to be protective (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-0.96, P=0.046). CONCLUSION: S. aureus-necrotizing pneumonia is still an extremely severe disease in patients with severe leukopenia. Some factors could distinguish these patients, allowing better initial identification to initiate adapted, rapid administration of appropriate therapy.","Khanafer, Nagham; Sicot, Nicolas; Vanhems, Philippe; Dumitrescu, Oana; Meyssonier, Vanina; Tristan, Anne; Bès, Michèle; Lina, Gérard; Vandenesch, François; Gillet, Yves; Etienne, Jérôme",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3750359/,133
1350,Early responses to H7N9 in southern Mainland China,2014-01-07,"BACKGROUND: H7N9 posed potentially serious health challenges for Chinese society. The previous SARS outbreak in this country was accompanied by contradictory information, while worries about wide-spread influenza led to discrimination worldwide. Early understanding of public threat perceptions is therefore important for effective public health communication and intervention. METHODS: We interviewed 1011 respondents by phone two weeks after the first case. Questions examined risk awareness and media use, beliefs about the emergence of the threat and those most at risk, anxiety about infection and preventive and avoidant behaviours. RESULTS: Results demonstrate moderate levels of anxiety but relatively high levels of trust towards government officials. Threat emergence was associated with hygiene levels, temperature change, floating pigs in the Huangpu River and migration to the city. Anxiety predicted both recommended and non-recommended behavioural changes. CONCLUSIONS: Comparatively high levels of trust in Chinese government advice about H7N9 contrast positively with previous pandemic communications in China. Anxiety helped drive both recommended and non-recommended behaviours, with potentially important economic and social implications. This included evidence of 'othering’ of those associated with the threat (e.g. migrants). Findings emphasise the need to manage public communications early during new influenza outbreaks.","Goodwin, Robin; Sun, Shaojing",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3890621/,133
1371,Idiopathic acute myocarditis during treatment for controlled human malaria infection: a case report,2014-01-30,"A 23-year-old healthy male volunteer took part in a clinical trial in which the volunteer took chloroquine chemoprophylaxis and received three intradermal doses at four-week intervals of aseptic, purified Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites to induce protective immunity against malaria. Fifty-nine days after the last administration of sporozoites and 32 days after the last dose of chloroquine the volunteer underwent controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) by the bites of five P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes. Eleven days post-CHMI a thick blood smear was positive (6 P. falciparum/μL blood) and treatment was initiated with atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone®). On the second day of treatment, day 12 post-CHMI, troponin T, a marker for cardiac tissue damage, began to rise above normal, and reached a maximum of 1,115 ng/L (upper range of normal = 14 ng/L) on day 16 post-CHMI. The volunteer had one ~20 minute episode of retrosternal chest pain and heavy feeling in his left arm on day 14 post-CHMI. ECG at the time revealed minor repolarization disturbances, and cardiac MRI demonstrated focal areas of subepicardial and midwall delayed enhancement of the left ventricle with some oedema and hypokinesia. A diagnosis of myocarditis was made. Troponin T levels were normal within 16 days and the volunteer recovered without clinical sequelae. Follow-up cardiac MRI at almost five months showed normal function of both ventricles and disappearance of oedema. Delayed enhancement of subepicardial and midwall regions decreased, but was still present. With the exception of a throat swab that was positive for rhinovirus on day 14 post-CHMI, no other tests for potential aetiologies of the myocarditis were positive. A number of possible aetiological factors may explain or have contributed to this case of myocarditis including, i) P. falciparum infection, ii) rhinovirus infection, iii) unidentified pathogens, iv) hyper-immunization (the volunteer received six travel vaccines between the last immunization and the CHMI), v) atovaquone/proguanil treatment, or vi) a combination of these factors. Definitive aetiology and pathophysiological mechanism for the myocarditis have not been established.","van Meer, Maurits PA; Bastiaens, Guido JH; Boulaksil, Mohamed; de Mast, Quirijn; Gunasekera, Anusha; Hoffman, Stephen L; Pop, Gheorghe; van der Ven, André JAM; Sauerwein, Robert W",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3909449/,133
1448,Tanshinone IIA Attenuates Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis via Modulating Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2/ Angiotensin-(1-7) Axis in Rats,2014-04-07,"Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a common complication in those interstitial lung diseases patients, which will result in poor prognosis and short survival. Traditional therapeutic methods such as glucocorticoid and cytotoxic drugs are insufficient for treating PF and may cause severe side effects. Recent studies showed that traditional Chinese herbal abstraction such as Tanshinone IIA (TIIA) was displayed significant anti-PF effects in animal models. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the protective effects of TIIA were not fully understood. Here we further investigated the protective effects of TIIA and its mechanisms underlying. PF models of rat were induced by bleomycin (BLM); TIIA was administered subsequently. The PF changes were identified by histopathological analyses. The results showed that BLM resulted in severe PF and alveolar inflammation; together with significant elevation of transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β1). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) together with angiotensin-(1-7) [ANG-(1-7)] were both greatly reduced after BLM administration. TIIA treatment notably attenuated BLM induced PF and inflammation, decreased expression of TGF-β1 and reversed ACE-2 and ANG-(1-7) production in rat lungs. Thus we may draw the conclusion that TIIA may exert protective effects on BLM induced PF in rats, and the ACE-2/ANG-(1-7) axis may ascribe to those protective effects.","Wu, Huajie; Li, Yan; Wang, Yanxia; Xu, Dunquan; Li, Congcong; Liu, Manling; Sun, Xin; Li, Zhichao",Int J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4003542/,133
1619,"Knowledge, attitudes and practices relating to influenza A(H7N9) risk among live poultry traders in Guangzhou City, China",2014-10-18,"BACKGROUND: Live poultry traders (LPTs) have greater risk to avian influenza due to occupational exposure to poultry. This study investigated knowledge, attitudes and practices of LPTs relating to influenza A (H7N9). METHODS: Using multi-stage cluster sampling, 306 LPTs were interviewed in Guangzhou by a standardized questionnaire between mid-May to June, 2013. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with preventive practices and attitudes towards various control measures implemented in live poultry markets against H7N9. RESULTS: Only 46.1% of the respondents recognized risks associated with contacts with bird secretions or droppings, and only 22.9% perceived personally ""likely/very likely"" to contract H7N9 infection. Around 60% of the respondents complied with hand-washing and wearing gloves, and only 20% reported wearing face masks. Only 16.3% of the respondents agreed on introducing central slaughtering of poultry. Being younger, involving in slaughtering poultry, having longer working hours, less access to H7N9-related information and poorer knowledge, and perceiving lower personal susceptibility to H7N9 infection were negatively associated with preventive practices. Comparing with previous studies conducted when human cases of H5N1 avian influenza infection was first identified in Guangdong, LPTs' perceived susceptibility to novel influenza viruses increased significantly but acceptance for central slaughtering of poultry remained low. CONCLUSIONS: Information on avian influenza provided through multiple communication tools may be necessary to promote knowledge among poultry traders. Familiarity with risk may have led to the lower perceived vulnerability to avian influenza and less protective actions among the LPTs particularly for those involving more risky exposure to live poultry. Reasons for the consistently low acceptance for central slaughtering of poultry await further exploration.

1649,Drug sales data analysis for outbreak detection of infectious diseases: a systematic literature review,2014-11-18,"BACKGROUND: This systematic literature review aimed to summarize evidence for the added value of drug sales data analysis for the surveillance of infectious diseases. METHODS: A search for relevant publications was conducted in Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, African Index Medicus and Lilacs databases. Retrieved studies were evaluated in terms of objectives, diseases studied, data sources, methodologies and performance for real-time surveillance. Most studies compared drug sales data to reference surveillance data using correlation measurements or indicators of outbreak detection performance (sensitivity, specificity, timeliness of the detection). RESULTS: We screened 3266 articles and included 27 in the review. Most studies focused on acute respiratory and gastroenteritis infections. Nineteen studies retrospectively compared drug sales data to reference clinical data, and significant correlations were observed in 17 of them. Four studies found that over-the-counter drug sales preceded clinical data in terms of incidence increase. Five studies developed and evaluated statistical algorithms for selecting drug groups to monitor specific diseases. Another three studies developed models to predict incidence increase from drug sales. CONCLUSIONS: Drug sales data analyses appear to be a useful tool for surveillance of gastrointestinal and respiratory disease, and OTC drugs have the potential for early outbreak detection. Their utility remains to be investigated for other diseases, in particular those poorly surveyed.

Over the last decade angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has emerged as a key player in the pathophysiology of hypertension and cardiovascular and renal disease due to its pivotal role in metabolizing vasoconstrictive/hypertrophic/proliferative angiotensin II into favorable angiotensin-(1-7). This review addresses a considerable advancement in research on the role of tissue ACE2 in development and progression of hypertension and cardiorenal injury. We also summarize the results from recent clinical and experimental studies suggesting that serum or urine soluble ACE2 may serve as a novel biomarker or independent risk factor relevant for diagnosis and prognosis of cardiorenal disease.

1692,Accounting for behavioral responses during a flu epidemic using home television viewing,2015-01-23,"BACKGROUND: Theory suggests that individual behavioral responses impact the spread of flu-like illnesses, but this has been difficult to empirically characterize. Social distancing is an important component of behavioral response, though analyses have been limited by a lack of behavioral data. Our objective is to use media data to characterize social distancing behavior in order to empirically inform explanatory and predictive epidemiological models. METHODS: We use data on variation in home television viewing as a proxy for variation in time spent in the home and, by extension, contact. This behavioral proxy is imperfect but appealing since information on a rich and representative sample is collected using consistent techniques across time and most major cities. We study the April-May 2009 outbreak of A/H1N1 in Central Mexico and examine the dynamic behavioral response in aggregate and contrast the observed patterns of various demographic subgroups. We develop and calibrate a dynamic behavioral model of disease transmission informed by the proxy data on daily variation in contact rates and compare it to a standard (non-adaptive) model and a fixed effects model that crudely captures behavior. RESULTS: We find that after a demonstrable initial behavioral response (consistent with social distancing) at the onset of the outbreak, there was attenuation in the response before the conclusion of the public health intervention. We find substantial differences in the behavioral response across age subgroups and socioeconomic levels. We also find that the dynamic behavioral and fixed effects transmission models better account for variation in new confirmed cases, generate more stable estimates of the baseline rate of transmission over time and predict the number of new cases over a short horizon with substantially less error. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that A/H1N1 had an innate transmission potential greater than previously thought but this was masked by behavioral responses. Observed differences in behavioral response across demographic groups indicate a potential benefit from targeting social distancing outreach efforts.","Springborn, Michael; Chowell, Gerardo; MacLachlan, Matthew; Fenichel, Eli P",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4304633/,133

METHODS: This project was conducted as part of an ongoing community-based surveillance study in New York City to identify viral etiologies of acute respiratory infection. In January 2014, following sample collection by trained research assistants, participants with acute respiratory infection from 30 households subsequently collected and returned a self-collected/parent-collected nasal swab via mail. Self/parental swabs corresponding with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction primary research samples were analyzed. RESULTS: Nearly all (96.8%, n=30/31) households agreed to participate; 100% reported returning the sample and 29 were received (median time: 8 days). Most (18; 62.1%) of the primary research samples were positive. For eight influenza-positive research samples, seven (87.5%) self-swabs were also positive. For ten other respiratory pathogen-positive research samples, eight (80.0%) self-swabs were positive. Sensitivity of self-swabs for any respiratory pathogen was 83.3% and 87.5% for influenza, and specificity for both was 100%. There was no relationship between level of education and concordance of results between positive research samples and their matching participant swab. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, self-swabbing was feasible and valid in a low-income, urban minority population.","Vargas, Celibell Y; Wang, Liqun; Castellanos de Belliard, Yaritza; Morban, Maria; Diaz, Hilbania; Larson, Elaine L; LaRussa, Philip; Saiman, Lisa; Stockwell, Melissa S",Clin Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4708198/,133
2616,Clinical features of community acquired adenovirus pneumonia during the 2011 community outbreak in Southern Taiwan: role of host immune response,2017-03-07,"BACKGROUND: Human adenovirus 7 (HAdV-7) was responsible for a significant number of fatalities during the 2011 community outbreak in Taiwan. The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of severe adenovirus infections in non-immunocompromised individuals remain unclear. Adenovirus pneumonia was associated with pleural effusion in a number of patients from the 2011 outbreak suggesting that similar to bacterial pneumonia, patients diagnosed with adenovirus pneumonia who have pleural effusion are more severely and systemically infected, and may have a more protracted disease course. We hypothesized that the host immunological response determines the severity of adenoviral infection. METHODS: This retrospective case series study included patients diagnosed with severe lower respiratory tract infections at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital in southern Taiwan between December 2010 and October 2011. The main inclusion criteria were 1) presence of multifocal patchy infiltrates, lobar consolidation or reticular interstitial opacities in chest X-rays, and 2) presence of adenovirus isolated from respiratory specimens. All patients had adenovirus isolated from respiratory specimens, and were negative for other viruses. Pleural effusion was confirmed in all patients using chest echography. Clinical features and laboratory data were compared in patients with (n = 12) and without (n = 15) parapneumonic effusion. RESULTS: Presence of parapneumonic effusion was significantly associated with a longer febrile duration, more complicated clinical management, and a greater risk of extrapulmonary involvement, notably hepatitis. Patients without pleural effusion had significantly higher numbers of WBCs, platelets, and absolute segment cell counts (ASCs) compared to patients with pleural effusion (all p < 0.05). Patients without pleural effusion had significantly higher counts of CD4+, CD8+, and CD20+ T cells (all p < 0.05) compared to patients with pleural effusion. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that presence of parapneumonic effusion in adenoviral pneumonia was associated with longer febrile duration, more complicated clinical management, a greater risk of hepatitis, and suppression of host cellular immunity. Further prospective, large-scale studies are needed to validate our results.","Shen, Ching-Fen; Wang, Shih-Min; Ho, Tzong-Shiann; Liu, Ching-Chuan",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5341368/,133
2853,Lessons from a decade of individual-based models for infectious disease transmission: a systematic review (2006-2015),2017-09-11,"BACKGROUND: Individual-based models (IBMs) are useful to simulate events subject to stochasticity and/or heterogeneity, and have become well established to model the potential (re)emergence of pathogens (e.g., pandemic influenza, bioterrorism). Individual heterogeneity at the host and pathogen level is increasingly documented to influence transmission of endemic diseases and it is well understood that the final stages of elimination strategies for vaccine-preventable childhood diseases (e.g., polio, measles) are subject to stochasticity. Even so it appears IBMs for both these phenomena are not well established. We review a decade of IBM publications aiming to obtain insights in their advantages, pitfalls and rationale for use and to make recommendations facilitating knowledge transfer within and across disciplines. METHODS: We systematically identified publications in Web of Science and PubMed from 2006-2015 based on title/abstract/keywords screening (and full-text if necessary) to retrieve topics, modeling purposes and general specifications. We extracted detailed modeling features from papers on established vaccine-preventable childhood diseases based on full-text screening. RESULTS: We identified 698 papers, which applied an IBM for infectious disease transmission, and listed these in a reference database, describing their general characteristics. The diversity of disease-topics and overall publication frequency have increased over time (38 to 115 annual publications from 2006 to 2015). The inclusion of intervention strategies (8 to 52) and economic consequences (1 to 20) are increasing, to the detriment of purely theoretical explorations. Unfortunately, terminology used to describe IBMs is inconsistent and ambiguous. We retrieved 24 studies on a vaccine-preventable childhood disease (covering 7 different diseases), with publication frequency increasing from the first such study published in 2008. IBMs have been useful to explore heterogeneous between- and within-host interactions, but combined applications are still sparse. The amount of missing information on model characteristics and study design is remarkable. CONCLUSIONS: IBMs are suited to combine heterogeneous within- and between-host interactions, which offers many opportunities, especially to analyze targeted interventions for endemic infections. We advocate the exchange of (open-source) platforms and stress the need for consistent “branding”. Using (existing) conventions and reporting protocols would stimulate cross-fertilization between research groups and fields, and ultimately policy making in decades to come.

We review and illustrate a simple data assimilation framework for calibrating mathematical models based on ordinary differential equation models using time series data describing the temporal progression of case counts relating, for instance, to population growth or infectious disease transmission dynamics. In contrast to Bayesian estimation approaches that always raise the question of how to set priors for the parameters, this frequentist approach relies on modeling the error structure in the data. We discuss issues related to parameter identifiability, uncertainty quantification and propagation as well as model performance and forecasts along examples based on phenomenological and mechanistic models parameterized using simulated and real datasets.","Chowell, Gerardo",Infect Dis Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5726591/,133
3309,The usefulness of hand washing during field training to prevent acute respiratory illness in a military training facility,2018-07-27,"Hand washing plays a key role in preventing respiratory infection in many clinical settings. However, its effectiveness in preventing acute respiratory illness (ARI) during field training in military training facilities has been not studied. A quasi-interventional study was performed to evaluate the prevalence of ARIs over 4 weeks in a Korean army training center in South Korea from January 2009 to February 2009. A total of 1291 recruits participating in military training for 4 weeks were randomly distributed to 2 battalions (one with 631 and the other with 660). After noticing there is a difference between the 2 battalions in terms of the development of ARIs at the end of 2 weeks of training, we conducted interviews with the battle commanders to determine factors that may be related to one battalion having a higher incidence of ARI. Thereafter, we performed an intervention, which consists of instructing the battalion having a higher incidence of ARI to implement field hand washing from the third week. Following the intervention, we compared the cumulative rate of ARI during 4 weeks of training. The interviews revealed that there were no major differences between the 2 battalions in terms of the training schedules, living environments, or indoor hand washing methods. However, there was difference in terms of hand washing during field training for the first 2 weeks; whereas one battalion (the early hand washing group) implemented hand washing during field training starting in the first week, the other battalion did not implement hand washing for the first 2 weeks but instead began in the third week (the late hand washing group). The cumulative incidence rate of ARI during 4 weeks of training was significantly lower in the early hand washing group (13.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.6%–15.9%) than in the late hand washing group (28.0%, 95% CI, 24.7%–31.5%). Our study suggests that outdoor hand washing during field training may be an effective precaution for reducing ARI incidence among recruits participating in military training.","Kim, Ho Seung; Ko, Ryoung Eun; Ji, Misuk; Lee, Ju-Hyung; Lee, Chang-Seop; Lee, Hyun",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6078659/,133
4173,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 regulates endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial function to preserve skeletal muscle lipid metabolism,2019-11-27,"OBJECTIVE: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial function affected intramuscular fat accumulation. However, there is no clear evident on the effect of the regulation of ER stress and mitochondrial function by Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the prevention of intramuscular fat metabolism. We investigated the effects of ACE2 on ER stress and mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle lipid metabolism. METHODS: The triglyceride (TG) content in skeletal muscle of ACE2 knockout mice and Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice were detected by assay kits. Meanwhile, the expression of lipogenic genes (ACCα, SREBP-1c, LXRα, CPT-1α, PGC-1α and PPARα), ER stress and mitochondrial function related genes (GRP78, eIF2α, ATF4, BCL-2, and SDH6) were analyzed by RT-PCR. Lipid metabolism, ER stress and mitochondrial function related genes were analyzed by RT-PCR in ACE2-overexpression C2C12 cell. Moreover, the IKKβ/NFκB/IRS-1 pathway was determined using lysate sample from skeletal muscle of ACE2 knockout mice. RESULTS: ACE2 deficiency in vivo is associated with increased lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle. The ACE2 knockout mice displayed an elevated level of ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions in skeletal muscle. In contrast, activation of ACE2 can ameliorate ER stress and mitochondrial function, which slightly accompanied by reduced TG content and down-regulated the expression of skeletal muscle lipogenic proteins in the db/db mice. Additionally, ACE2 improved skeletal muscle lipid metabolism and ER stress genes in the C2C12 cells. Mechanistically, endogenous ACE2 improved lipid metabolism through the IKKβ/NFκB/IRS-1 pathway in skeletal muscle. CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 was first reported to play a notable role on intramuscular fat regulation by improving endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial function. This study may provide a strategy for treating insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.","Cao, Xi; Lu, Xin-Meng; Tuo, Xiu; Liu, Jing-Yi; Zhang, Yi-Chen; Song, Li-Ni; Cheng, Zhi-Qiang; Yang, Jin-Kui; Xin, Zhong",Lipids Health Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6882339/,133
4348,Implementation of human factors engineering approach to improve environmental cleaning and disinfection in a medical center,2020-01-16,"BACKGROUND: Inadequate hospital cleaning may contribute to cross-transmission of pathogens. It is important to implement effective cleaning for the safe hospital environment. We conducted a three-phase study using human factors engineering (HFE) approach to enhance environmental cleanliness. METHODS: This study was conducted using a prospective interventional trial, and 28 (33.3%) of 84 wards in a medical center were sampled. The three-phases included pre-intervention analysis (Phase 1), implementing interventions by HFE principles (Phase 2), and programmatic analysis (Phase 3). The evaluations of terminal cleaning and disinfection were performed using the fluorescent marker, the adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence assay, and the aerobic colony count method simultaneously in all phases. Effective terminal cleaning and disinfection was qualified with the aggregate outcome of the same 10 high-touch surfaces per room. A score for each high-touch surface was recorded, with 0 denoting a fail and 10 denoting a pass by the benchmark of the evaluation method, and the total terminal cleaning and disinfection score (TCD score) was a score out of 100. RESULTS: In each phase, 840 high-touch surfaces were collected from 84 rooms after terminal cleaning and disinfection. After the interventions, the TCD score by the three evaluation methods all showed significant improved. The carriage incidence of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) decreased significantly from 4.1 per 1000 patient-days to 3.6 per 1000 patient-days (P = .03). CONCLUSION: The HFE approach can improve the thoroughness and the effectiveness of terminal cleaning and disinfection, and resulted in a reduction of patient carriage of MDRO at hospitals. Larger studies are necessary to establish whether such efforts of cleanliness can reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infection.","Hung, I-Chen; Chang, Hao-Yuan; Cheng, Aristine; Chen, Mei-Wen; Chen, An-Chi; Ting, Ling; Lai, Yeur-Hur; Wang, Jann-Tay; Chen, Yee-Chun; Sheng, Wang-Huei",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6966902/,133
4428,Novel Variants of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 of Shorter Molecular Size to Target the Kidney Renin Angiotensin System,2019-12-17,"ACE2 is a monocarboxypeptidase which generates Angiotensin (1–7) from Angiotensin II (1–8). Attempts to target the kidney Renin Angiotensin System using native ACE2 to treat kidney disease are hampered by its large molecular size, 100 kDa, which precludes its glomerular filtration and subsequent tubular uptake. Here, we show that both urine and kidney lysates are capable of digesting native ACE2 into shorter proteins of ~60–75 kDa and then demonstrate that they are enzymatically very active. We then truncated the native ACE2 by design from the C-terminus to generate two short recombinant (r)ACE2 variants (1-605 and 1-619AA). These two truncates have a molecular size of ~70 kDa, as expected from the amino acid sequence and as shown by Western blot. ACE2 enzyme activity, measured using a specific substrate, was higher than that of the native rACE2 (1-740 AA). When infused to mice with genetic ACE2 deficiency, a single i.v. injection of 1-619 resulted in detectable ACE2 activity in urine, whereas infusion of the native ACE2 did not. Moreover, ACE2 activity was recovered in harvested kidneys from ACE2-deficient mice infused with 1-619, but not in controls (23.1 ± 4.3 RFU/µg creatinine/h and 1.96 ± 0.73 RFU/µg protein/hr, respectively). In addition, the kidneys of ACE2-null mice infused with 1-619 studied ex vivo formed more Ang (1–7) from exogenous Ang II than those infused with vehicle (AUC 8555 ± 1933 vs. 3439 ± 753 ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.05) further demonstrating the functional effect of increasing kidney ACE2 activity after the infusion of our short ACE2 1-619 variant. We conclude that our novel short recombinant ACE2 variants undergo glomerular filtration, which is associated with kidney uptake of enzymatically active proteins that can enhance the formation of Ang (1–7) from Ang II. These small ACE2 variants may offer a potentially useful approach to target kidney RAS overactivity to combat kidney injury.","Wysocki, Jan; Schulze, Arndt; Batlle, Daniel",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6995632/,133
4565,Suspension microarray-based comparison of oropharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for pathogen identification in young children hospitalized with respiratory tract infection,2020-02-22,"Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza virus is a multifunctional protein that plays an important role in virus replication and virulence. In this study, an acetylation modification was identified at the K108 residue of the NS1 protein of H1N1 influenza virus. To further explore the function of the K108 acetylation modification of the NS1 protein, a deacetylation-mimic mutation (K108R) and a constant acetylation-mimic mutation (K108Q) were introduced into the NS1 protein in the background of A/WSN/1933 H1N1 (WSN), resulting in two mutant viruses (WSN-NS1-108R and WSN-NS1-108Q). In vitro and mouse studies showed that the deacetylation-mimic mutation K108R in the NS1 protein attenuated the replication and virulence of WSN-NS1-108R, while the constant acetylation-mimic mutant virus WSN-NS1-108Q showed similar replication and pathogenicity as the wild-type WSN virus (WSN-wt). The results indicated that acetylation at K108 of the NS1 protein has an important role in the replication and virulence of influenza virus. To further explore the potential mechanism, the type I interferon (IFN-I) antagonistic activity of the three NS1 proteins (NS1-108Q, NS1-108R, and NS1-wt) was compared in cells, which showed that the K108R mutation significantly attenuated the IFN-β antagonistic activity of the NS1 protein compared with NS1-wt and NS1-108Q. Both NS1-wt and NS1-108Q inhibited the IFN-β response activated by RIG-I CARD domain, MAVS, TBK1, and IRF3 more efficiently than the NS1-108R protein in cells. Taken together, the results indicated that acetylation at NS1 K108 is important for the IFN antagonistic activity of the NS1 protein and virulence of the influenza virus.","Ma, Jingjiao; Wu, Rujuan; Xu, Guanlong; Cheng, Yuqiang; Wang, Zhaofei; Wang, Heng’an; Yan, Yaxian; Li, Jinxiang; Sun, Jianhe",Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7038556/,133
6335,Relationship between circulating levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-angiotensin-(1–7)-MAS axis and coronary heart disease,2019-07-29,"BACKGROUND: Influenza virus infection of the respiratory tract is associated with a range of neurologic complications. The emergence of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus has been linked to neurological complications, including encephalopathy and encephalitis. METHODS: Case report and literature review. RESULTS: We reviewed case management of a 20-year old Hispanic male who developed febrile upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms followed by a confusional state. He had rapid neurologic decline and his clinical course was complicated by refractory seizures and malignant brain edema. He was managed with oseltamavir and peramavir, corticosteroids, intravenous gamma globulin treatment, anticonvulsants, intracranial pressure management with external ventricular drain placement, hyperosmolar therapy, sedation, and mechanical ventilation. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasal secretions confirmed 2009 H1N1 virus infection; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for 2009 H1N1 viral RNA. Follow-up imaging demonstrated improvement in brain edema but restricted diffusion in the basal ganglia. We provide a review of the clinical spectrum of neurologic complications of seasonal influenza and 2009 H1N1, and current approaches towards managing these complications. CONCLUSIONS: 2009 H1N1-associated acute encephalitis and encephalopathy appear to be variable in severity, including a subset of patients with a malignant clinical course complicated by high morbidity and mortality. Since the H1N1 influenza virus has not been detected in the CSF or brain tissue in patients with this diagnosis, the emerging view is that the host immune response plays a key role in pathogenesis.","Akins, Paul Taylor; Belko, John; Uyeki, Timothy M.; Axelrod, Yekaterina; Lee, Kenneth K.; Silverthorn, James",Neurocrit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100075/,133

On the basis of this preclinical model, we conditioned 30 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies with rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and TBI, to reduce rates of fatal acute GVHD. Patients were enrolled in two sequential groups: cohort 1 received ATG 10 mg/kg in divided doses (days −4 to −1)+200 cGy TBI (n=16), and cohort 2 received ATG (days −10 to −7)+450 cGy TBI (n=14). Median donor blood chimerism for the combined group was 94, 93 and 93% in the first, second and third months after transplant. Only three developed grade II acute GVHD despite 43% of patients receiving unrelated donor transplants. One-year survival was 71±11 and 54±14%, respectively, in recipients of related and unrelated donor SCT. Donor lymphocyte infusions were needed in 12 patients for the management of relapse and for mixed donor–recipient chimerism in 4 patients. We conclude that 10 mg/kg ATG and TBI allows engraftment with a low risk of acute GVHD; however, further dose optimization of ATG is required to achieve a balance between GVHD and disease relapse.","Toor, A; Rodriguez, T; Bauml, M; Mathews, H; Shanti, S; Senitzer, D; Kini, A; Norton, J; Parthasarathy, M; Mohideen, N; Petrowsky, C; Bonilla, B; Smith, S; Stiff, P",Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101790/,133

We performed a retrospective nationwide survey to clarify the current status of RSV disease among infants with hematological malignancies. Clinical course, treatment, and outcome of patients with hematological malignancies who suffered from RSV infections at the age of <24 months during anti-tumor therapy from April 2006 to March 2009 were investigated by sending a questionnaire to all member institutions of the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (JPLSG). Twelve patients with acute leukemia were identified as having experienced RSV disease. The primary diseases were acute myeloid leukemia (n = 8) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 4). RSV infection occurred pre- or during induction therapy (n = 8) and during consolidation therapy (n = 4). Eight patients developed LRTI, four of whom had severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome; these four patients died despite receiving intensive care. In our survey, the prognosis of RSV disease in pediatric hematological malignancies was poor, and progression of LRTI in particular was associated with high mortality.

6758,Primary Immunodeficiency Disorders in Kuwait: First Report from Kuwait National Primary Immunodeficiency Registry (2004–2006),2007-11-16,"BACKGROUND: The radiologic evaluation of the transplanted bowel is largely unknown and rather complex because it involves several techniques that depend on indications and times that have not been fully defined. METHODS: From December 2000 to November 2002 in the Section of Radiology I of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Modena, Italy), 11 patients with transplanted bowel were studied with different methods: traditional radiologic evaluation with contrast agent (all patients), evaluation of transit time with radiopaque markers (five patients), ultrasonographic (US) evaluation of the intestinal wall and Doppler US of the vascular axes (five patients), computed tomographic (CT) evaluation (all patients), and magnetic resonance (MR) evaluation of the bowel and the vascular axes (five patients). Traditional contrast examination enabled evaluation of the gastroesophageal transit and cardia functionality; anatomy and integrity of the anastomoses (proximal and distal); time of gastric emptying; morphology, tone, and kinesis of the transplanted small bowel loops and time of global transit. The study of transit with radiopaque markers was carried out in five patients to define the time of transit through the entire transplanted bowel, confirm recovery of intestinal motility, and identify possible abnormalities. The US examination was carried out in five patients to evaluate the morphology, thickness, and echo structural features of the intestinal loops. Color Doppler was performed to visualize the superior mesenteric artery and a wall arteriole of the sampled loop. CT examination was performed 2 to 4 weeks after surgery to evaluate the anatomy of the transplanted organs, arterial and venous anastomoses in case of complications identified with other methods or suspected, and periodically in the follow-up of patients who underwent transplantation due to Gardner syndrome. The protocol for MR evaluation of the bowel included coronal single-shot fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences, axial and/or sagittal single-shot fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences, coronal fast multiplanar spoiled gradient-echo (FMP- SPGR) sequences, coronal FMPSPGR sequences with and without administration of intravenous paramagnetic contrast agent, and axial or sagittal FMPSPGR fat-saturated sequences performed after dynamic gadolinium administration. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The study of transit with radiopaque markers was useful in patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction because it identified recovery and normalization of motility. Traditional contrast examination of the gastrointestinal tract continues to play an important role in transplanted patients because it is a simple examination that allows evaluation of the graft anatomy and recovery of motility of the residual native bowel and the transplanted loops. Moreover, it plays a crucial role in early detection of major postoperative complications such as intestinal obstruction, perforation, fistulas, and anastomotic complications (stenosis and dehiscence). CT examination is crucial for the detection of fluid collections, abscesses, and fistulas because it can serve as a guide of drainage and during follow-up of patients with Gardner syndrome can be used to investigate all possible sites in which desmoids might arise in addition to their relation to the graft. Because patients with transplanted bowel are generally rather a young population of reproductive age and because of technologic advances, MR may represent an effective method that does not use ionizing radiation and can therefore substitute for traditional radiologic evaluation. US represents a quick examination technique that is easily available and well tolerated by patients, and it has a role to play in the follow-up of transplanted patients and in the identification of major postoperative complications. However, its role in monitoring possible rejection remains to be defined with studies on wider and more representative samples.","Pecchi, A.; De Santis, M.; Torricelli, P.; Romagnoli, R.; Francesco, F. di; Cautero, N.; Pinna, A.",Abdom Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102087/,133

METHODS: From September 2009 to February 2011, we treated 117 children infected with 2009 influenza A virus who were admitted in different hospitals in Rajkot city. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was used to confirm infection, and the clinico-epidemiological features of the disease were closely monitored. RESULTS: In the 117 patients, with a median age of 2 years, 59.8% were male.

Aetiological studies have focused on the presence of a limited number of pathogens. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of a wide range of bacteria and viruses, including Fusobacterium necrophorum, in patients with pharyngotonsillitis and in asymptomatic controls. A prospective case control study was performed in primary healthcare in Kronoberg County, Sweden. Patients (n = 220) aged 15 to 45 years with a suspected acute pharyngotonsillitis, and controls (n = 128), were included. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were analysed for β-hemolytic streptococci, F. necrophorum, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and 13 respiratory viruses. Serum samples were analysed for antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus. The patient history and symptoms, including Centor score, were analysed in relation to pathogens. In 155/220 (70.5%) of the patients, as compared to 26/128 (20.3%) of the controls (p <0.001), at least one microorganism was found. Group A streptococci, F. necrophorum, and influenza B virus were the three most common findings, and all significantly more common in patients than in controls (p <0.001, p 0.001, and p 0.002, respectively). Patients with F. necrophorum only (n = 14) displayed a lower Centor score than patients with Group A streptococcus only (n = 46), but a higher score than patients with influenza B, other viruses, or no potential pathogen (Kruskal-Wallis p <0.001). A pathogen was detected in 70% of the patients, displaying a wide range of pathogens contributing to the aetiology of pharyngotonsillitis. This study supports F. necrophorum as one of the pathogens to be considered in the aetiology of pharyngotonsillitis.","Hedin, K.; Bieber, L.; Lindh, M.; Sundqvist, M.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128797/,133

10247,Initially elevated arterial lactate as an independent predictor of poor outcomes in severe acute pancreatitis,2020-04-19,"Positive‐stranded RNA viruses, like many other viruses, have evolved to exploit the host cellular machinery to their own advantage. In eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin‐proteasome system (UPS) that serves as the major intracellular pathway for protein degradation and modification plays a crucial role in the regulation of many fundamental cellular functions. A growing amount of evidence has suggested that the UPS can be utilized by positive‐sense RNA viruses. The UPS eliminates excess viral proteins that prevent viral replication and modulates the function of viral proteins through post‐translational modification mediated by ubiquitin or ubiquitin‐like proteins. This review will discuss the current understanding of how positive RNA viruses have evolved various mechanisms to usurp the host UPS to modulate the function and stability of viral proteins. In addition to the pro‐viral function, UPS‐mediated viral protein degradation may also constitute a host defense process against some positive‐stranded RNA viral infections. This issue will also be discussed in the current review.

10870,The burden of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection in Lebanon between 2008 and 2016: a single tertiary care center experience,2020-05-12,"BACKGROUND: In addition to causing the pandemic influenza outbreaks of 1918 and 2009, subtype H1N1 influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused seasonal epidemics since 1977. Antigenic property of influenza viruses are determined by both protein sequence and N-linked glycosylation of influenza glycoproteins, especially hemagglutinin (HA). The currently available computational methods are only considered features in protein sequence but not N-linked glycosylation. RESULTS: A multi-task learning sparse group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) (MTL-SGL) regression method was developed and applied to derive two types of predominant features including protein sequence and N-linked glycosylation in hemagglutinin (HA) affecting variations in serologic data for human and swine H1N1 IAVs. Results suggested that mutations and changes in N-linked glycosylation sites are associated with the rise of antigenic variants of H1N1 IAVs. Furthermore, the implicated mutations are predominantly located at five reported antibody-binding sites, and within or close to the HA receptor binding site. All of the three N-linked glycosylation sites (i.e. sequons NCSV at HA 54, NHTV at HA 125, and NLSK at HA 160) identified by MTL-SGL to determine antigenic changes were experimentally validated in the H1N1 antigenic variants using mass spectrometry analyses. Compared with conventional sparse learning methods, MTL-SGL achieved a lower prediction error and higher accuracy, indicating that grouped features and MTL in the MTL-SGL method are not only able to handle serologic data generated from multiple reagents, supplies, and protocols, but also perform better in genetic sequence-based antigenic quantification. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the results of this study suggest that mutations and variations in N-glycosylation in HA caused antigenic variations in H1N1 IAVs and that the sequence-based antigenicity predictive model will be useful in understanding antigenic evolution of IAVs.","Li, Lei; Chang, Deborah; Han, Lei; Zhang, Xiaojian; Zaia, Joseph; Wan, Xiu-Feng",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7216668/,133

Yet, the World Health Organization (WHO) aims to reduce morbidity and mortality by 90 and 95%, respectively, between 2015 and 2035. Although diagnostics, therapeutics, and a vaccine are available, it is beyond doubt that better intervention measures are needed to accomplish this ambitious goal. The vaccine bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) partially protects infants against TB, but it is virtually ineffective against pulmonary TB in adolescents and adults. The efficacy of this vaccine, however, has not yet been fully exploited. In addition, new vaccine candidates are currently being assessed in clinical trials. Because a quarter of all people are latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), new vaccines must be applied not only prior to infection (pre-exposure vaccination) but also after infection (postexposure vaccination). Prevention of infection, prevention of disease, and prevention of recurrence are currently assessed as clinical endpoints. Because protection against TB is primarily mediated by T lymphocytes, TB vaccine development focuses on protective T cell responses. Protein adjuvant formulations, viral vectors, and killed and live bacterial vaccines are currently being assessed in clinical trials. Moreover, therapeutic vaccination is clinically tested, notably in adjunct to canonical drug therapy to multiresistant TB. It is likely that a single vaccine cannot accomplish the various indications and that different vaccination strategies are required.","Kaufmann, Stefan H.

15133,Clinical characteristics of refractory mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children treated with glucocorticoid pulse therapy,2021-01-28,"It has long been known that noncoding genomic regions can be obligate cis elements acted upon in trans by gene products. In viruses, cis elements regulate gene expression, encapsidation, and other maturation processes, but mapping these elements relies on targeted iterative deletion or laborious prospecting for rare spontaneously occurring mutants. Here, we introduce a method to comprehensively map viral cis and trans elements at single-nucleotide resolution by high-throughput random deletion. Variable-size deletions are randomly generated by transposon integration, excision, and exonuclease chewback and then barcoded for tracking via sequencing (i.e., random deletion library sequencing [RanDeL-seq]). Using RanDeL-seq, we generated and screened >23,000 HIV-1 variants to generate a single-base resolution map of HIV-1’s cis and trans elements. The resulting landscape recapitulated HIV-1’s known cis-acting elements (i.e., long terminal repeat [LTR], Ψ, and Rev response element [RRE]) and, surprisingly, indicated that HIV-1’s central DNA flap (i.e., central polypurine tract [cPPT] to central termination sequence [CTS]) is as critical as the LTR, Ψ, and RRE for long-term passage. Strikingly, RanDeL-seq identified a previously unreported ∼300-bp region downstream of RRE extending to splice acceptor 7 that is equally critical for sustained viral passage. RanDeL-seq was also used to construct and screen a library of >90,000 variants of Zika virus (ZIKV). Unexpectedly, RanDeL-seq indicated that ZIKV’s cis-acting regions are larger than the untranscribed (UTR) termini, encompassing a large fraction of the nonstructural genes. Collectively, RanDeL-seq provides a versatile framework for generating viral deletion mutants, enabling discovery of replication mechanisms and development of novel antiviral therapeutics, particularly for emerging viral infections.","Notton, Timothy; Glazier, Joshua J.; Saykally, Victoria R.; Thompson, Cassandra E.; Weinberger, Leor S.",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7845639/,133

We report 5-year results of a longitudinal, parallel-group, blinded end-point study of living kidney donors (n=50) and healthy controls (n=45). The primary end point, left ventricular mass, was measured using cardiac magnetic resonance. Secondary end points, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, and pulse wave velocity were measured using validated blood pressure monitors and the SphygmoCor device. Effect sizes were calculated as differences between change from baseline in the donor and control groups. In donors, estimated glomerular filtration rate was 95±15 mL/min per 1.73 m2 at baseline (predonation) and 67±14 mL/min per 1.73 m2 at 5 years. In controls, there was a −1±2 mL/min per 1.73 m2 decline per annum. Change in left ventricular mass at 5 years was not significantly different between donors and controls (mean difference, +0.40 g [95% CI, −4.68 to 5.49] P=0.876), despite an initial increase in mass in donors compared with controls at 12 months. Pulse wave velocity, which increased in donors at 12 months, returned to levels not different from controls at 5 years (mean difference, −0.24 m/s [95% CI, −0.69 to 0.21]). Change in ambulatory systolic blood pressure was not different in donors compared with controls (mean difference, +1.91 mm Hg [95% CI, −2.72 to 6.54]).

Incorporating this methodology into the decision-making routine of clinical practice will improve the patients’ health care, increase patient safety, and optimize resources use. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate a new tool (KNOWBED system) as a clinical decision support system to support scientific knowledge, enabling health care professionals to quickly carry out decision-making processes based on EBM during their routine clinical practice. METHODS: Two components integrate the KNOWBED system: a web-based knowledge station and a mobile app. A use case (bronchiolitis pathology) was selected to validate the KNOWBED system in the context of the Paediatrics Unit of the Virgen Macarena University Hospital (Seville, Spain). The validation was covered in a 3-month pilot using 2 indicators: usability and efficacy. RESULTS: The KNOWBED system has been designed, developed, and validated to support clinical decision making in mobility based on standards that have been incorporated into the routine clinical practice of health care professionals. Using this tool, health care professionals can consult existing scientific knowledge at the bedside, and access recommendations of clinical protocols established based on EBM. During the pilot project, 15 health care professionals participated and accessed the system for a total of 59 times.

Malnutrition in older people increases the risk of infections, disease period and hospitalization rates. This study aimed to compare the different anthropometric indices for detecting malnutrition among older people and comparing these indices among males and females to explain the possible differences. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 2721 aged 65 years and older in Turkey were enrolled. Anthropometric measurements weight, height, hip circumference (HC), and waist circumference (WC), abdominal circumference (AC), mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), triceps skinfold thickness (TST), calf circumference (CC)) were measured. Body mass index (BMI), abdominal volume index (AVI), body roundness index (BRI) and body adiposity index (BAI), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) indices were calculated using standardized formulas. The receiver operator characteristic curves (ROCs) were conducted in detecting the best anthropometric parameters. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) (stratified by sex) calculated for each anthropometric index. RESULTS: Participants with both BMI < 18.5 (1.1%) and BMI > 25 (80%) defined as the malnourished group and BMI of 18.5–24.99 (18.9%) defined as the normal group. In both sexes, the area under the curve (AUC) was > 0.7 for all anthropometric indices except WHR in females (AUC 0.66). BRI, WHR, WHtR, and AVI indices strongly predict the risk of malnutrition among both sexes. In males, the ORs were for BRI (6.83, 95% CI 5.39–8.66), WHR (6.43, 95% CI 5.9–6.9), AVI (2.02, 95% CI 1.86–2.12). In females, the ORs were for BRI (3.72, 95% CI 3.09–4.48), WtHR (2.63, 95% CI 1.3–3.5), and WHR (2.45, 95% CI 1.9–3.06).

We hypothesized that patients with a high risk of pulmonary infection could be screened out as early after surgery. Hence, we developed and validated the first risk prediction model to verify our hypothesis. METHODS: Patients who underwent CHD surgery from October 2012 to December 2017 in the Children’s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were included in the development group, while patients who underwent CHD surgery from December 2017 to October 2018 were included in the validation group. The independent risk factors associated with pulmonary infection following CHD surgery were screened using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. The corresponding nomogram prediction model was constructed according to the regression coefficients. Model discrimination was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) (AUC), and model calibration was conducted with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. RESULTS: The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified the following six independent risk factors of pulmonary infection after cardiac surgery: age, weight, preoperative hospital stay, risk-adjusted classification for congenital heart surgery (RACHS)-1 score, cardiopulmonary bypass time and intraoperative blood transfusion. We established an individualized prediction model of pulmonary infection following cardiopulmonary bypass surgery for CHD in children. The model displayed accuracy and reliability and was evaluated by discrimination and calibration analyses. The AUCs for the development and validation groups were 0.900 and 0.908, respectively, and the P-values of the calibration tests were 0.999 and 0.452 respectively. Therefore, the predicted probability of the model was consistent with the actual probability. CONCLUSIONS: Identified the independent risk factors of pulmonary infection after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. An individualized prediction model was developed to evaluate the pulmonary infection of patients after surgery. For high-risk patients, after surgery, targeted interventions can reduce the risk of pulmonary infection.","Ren, Chunnian; Wu, Chun; Pan, Zhengxia; Wang, Quan; Li, Yonggang",J Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8025064/,133

The present study aimed at evaluating hunger-based early feeding for its efficacy in reducing length of hospitalisation. AIMS AND METHODS: This was a parallel arm superiority randomized control trial. Patients with moderate and severe acute pancreatitis were randomised into hunger-based feeding and conventional feeding groups. Patients in hunger-based feeding group commenced feeding once they felt hungry and in conventional feeding group after normalization of biochemical parameters and resolution of symptoms. Patients were followed up till their discharge and were analyzed for length of hospitalisation, fasting duration, feed intolerance, incidence of infective morbidities and invasive procedures. RESULTS: Hunger-based feeding and conventional feeding group included 56 and 54 patients, respectively. Hunger-based feeding led to a decrease in length of hospitalization (6.3 days in hunger-based feeding vs 7.3 days in conventional feeding group, P = 0.041) and fasting duration (1.6 days in hunger-based feeding vs 2.7 days in conventional feeding group, P = 0.001).The incidence of feed intolerance (P = 0.098), infective morbidities and invasive non-surgical procedures were similar in both the groups.

19767,"Infection Prevention and Control in Health Care, Part 1: Facility Planning and Management",2021-08-04,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) is endemic in many parts of the world. Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) in DENV infections occurs when a person with primary immunity is infected by a second, different DENV strain. Antibodies to Zika virus (ZIKV), which emerged in the Western Hemisphere in 2015, are cross reactive with DENV and theoretically could provoke ADE in a DENV naïve individual. CASE PRESENTATION: DENV infection was suspected in a child who had recently returned from a one-month stay in the Dominican Republic. The child presented with fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, and in hypovolemic shock. Volume and pressor resuscitation were unsuccessful, and the child died less than 24 h after hospitalization. Laboratory results suggested an early acute first DENV infection since serum, plasma, and spinal fluid had DENV1 detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), yet the serum lacked IgG antibodies to DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of all four DENV serotypes. This acute DENV infection occurred in the presence of a remote ZIKV infection as determined by antibodies to ZIKV NS1 envelope by multiplex microsphere immunoassay and an exceptionally high plaque reduction neutralization titer to ZIKV. ZIKV IgG avidity index was high, confirming a past infection. DENV1 RNA was detected in all ten organs and tissues examined by PCR. The severe and fatal complications reported here suggest that a remote ZIKV infection may provoke an exaggerated immune response leading to hypovolemic shock when primarily infected by DENV1. CONCLUSION: We report the first known patient in the United States with a rapidly progressive and fatal case of travel-associated DENV in which prior exposure to ZIKV likely played a role in triggering an ADE phenomenon. This association of prior ZIKV immunity and subsequent new dengue infection is a worrisome phenomenon and an important contribution to the body of knowledge on immunity to flaviviruses.","Bonheur, Ashley N.; Thomas, Sarah; Soshnick, Sara H.; McGibbon, Emily; Dupuis, Alan P.; Hull, Rene; Slavinski, Sally; Del Rosso, Paula E.; Weiss, Don; Hunt, Danielle T.; McCabe, Megan E.; Dean, Amy B.; Folkerth, Rebecca; Laib, Anne M.; Wong, Susan J.",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8334327/,133

Although clinical evidence for PPCs prevention is often unclear and crucial, measures occur to reduce PPCs. One device usually used for this reason is incentive spirometry (IS). The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of preoperative incentive spirometry to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications, improve postoperative oxygenation, and decrease hospital stay following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery patients. METHODS: This was a clinical randomized prospective study. A total of 80 patients were selected as candidates for CABG at An-Najah National University Hospital, Nablus-Palestine. Patients had been randomly assigned into two groups: incentive spirometry group (IS), SI performed before surgery (study group) and control group, preoperative spirometry was not performed. The 40 patients in each group received the same protocol of anesthesia and ventilation in the operating room. RESULT: The study findings showed a significant difference between the IS and control groups in the incidence of postoperative atelectasis. There were 8 patients (20.0%) in IS group and 17 patients (42.5%) in the control group (p = 0.03). Mechanical ventilation duration was significantly less in IS group. The median was four hours versus six hours in the control group (p < 0.001). Hospital length of stay was significantly less in IS group, and the median was six days versus seven days in the control group (p < 0.001). The median of the amount of arterial blood oxygen and oxygen saturation was significantly improved in the IS group (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Preoperative incentive spirometry for two days along with the exercise of deep breathing, encouraged coughing, and early ambulation following CABG are in connection with prevention and decreased incidence of atelectasis, hospital stay, mechanical ventilation duration and improved postoperative oxygenation with better pain control.

We aimed to perform an epidemiological study of tick-borne zoonotic Rickettsia, Borrelia, and Anaplasmataceae in horses from Midwestern Brazil. We also evaluated whether Borrelia spp. and Anaplasmataceae may be associated with hematological disorders in the sampled animals.

Seropositivity rates of 20.6% for Borrelia spp., 25.6% for Rickettsia spp., and 31.6% for Anaplasmataceae were found in the sampled horses. Considering both molecular and serological tests for Borrelia spp., the infection rate was 48.0% (126/262). None of the tested horses showed molecular positivity for Anaplasma phagocytophilum. The horses sampled displayed 7.2% of parasitism by ixodid ticks in single and coinfestations. We did not find DNA of any studied bacteria in the sampled ticks. Positive horses for Borrelia spp. and Anaplasmataceae agents displayed leukopenia, monocytopenia, and lymphopenia. Together, our results suggest that horses may play a role as sentinel host for zoonotic bacteria and Borrelia spp. and Anaplasmataceae agents can impair the health of horses.","Campos, João Bosco Vilela; Martins, Filipe Santos; de Oliveira, Carina Elisei; Taveira, Amanda Alves; Oliveira, João Roberto de; Gonçalves, Luiz Ricardo; Cordeiro, Matheus Dias; Calchi, Ana Claudia; de Campos Binder, Lina; Serpa, Maria Carolina de Azevedo; Barbieri, Amália Regina Mar; Labruna, Marcelo B.; Machado, Rosangela Zacarias; de Andrade, Gisele Braziliano; André, Marcos Rogério; Herrera, Heitor Miraglia",Trop Anim Health Prod,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8457776/,133

This article describes how an artificial intelligence (AI) mechanism that operates continuously on input from the user may alleviate such problems by using a type of machine learning known as Bayesian optimization. The basic AI mechanism is described, and studies showing its effects both in the laboratory and in the field are summarized. A crucial fact about the use of this AI is that it generates large amounts of user data that serve as input for scientific understanding as well as for the development of hearing aids and hearing care. Analyses of users' listening environments based on these data show the distribution of activities and intentions in situations where hearing is challenging. Finally, this article demonstrates how further AI-based analyses of the data can drive development.","Balling, Laura Winther; Mølgaard, Lasse Lohilahti; Townend, Oliver; Nielsen, Jens Brehm Bagger",Semin Hear,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8463120/,133

These molecules were developed during evolution through natural selection in that they fit many important molecular targets, often receptors, of cells, which are seen in molecules that mimic endogenous neurotransmitters. The chapter discusses that microorganisms and herbivores rely on plants as a food source. Since both have survived, there must be mechanisms of adaptations toward the defensive chemistry of plants. Many herbivores have evolved strategies to avoid the extremely toxic plants and prefer the less toxic ones. Many herbivores have potent mechanisms to detoxify xenobiotics, which allow the exploitation of at least the less toxic plants. In insects, many specialists evolved that are adapted to the defense chemicals of their host plant, in that they accumulate these compounds and exploit them for their own defense. Alkaloids function as defense molecules against insect predators in the examples studied, and this is further support for the hypothesis that the same compound also serves for chemical defense in the host plant. It needs more experimental data to understand fully the intricate interconnections between plants, their alkaloids, and herbivores, microorganisms, and other plants.","Wink, Michael",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148816/,133

Here, we have investigated how two types of APCs, monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), react to different bacterial strains typical of the commensal intestinal flora. Purified monocytes and monocyte‐derived DCs were stimulated with UV‐inactivated gram‐positive (Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis) and gram‐negative (Escherichia coli and Veillonella parvula) bacterial strains. Monocytes produced higher levels of IL‐12p70 and TNF, as detected by ELISA, in response to L. plantarum than to E. coli and V. parvula. In contrast, DCs secreted high amounts of IL‐12p70, TNF, IL‐6 and IL‐10 in response to E. coli and V. parvula but were practically unresponsive to L. plantarum and B. adolescentis. The lack of response to the gram‐positive strains correlated with a lower surface expression of Toll‐like reseptor 2 (TLR2) on DCs compared to monocytes. The surface expression of TLR4 on DCs was undetectable when analysed by flow cytometry, but blocking this receptor decreased the TNF production in response to V. parvula, indicating that low TLR4 expression on DCs is sufficient to mount an inflammatory response to gram‐negative bacteria. IFN‐γ increased the expression of TLR4 on DCs and also potentiated the cytokine response to gram‐negative bacteria. Our results indicate that, when monocytes differentiate into DCs, their ability to respond to different commensal bacteria dramatically changes, thereby becoming unresponsive to probiotic gram‐positive bacteria. These results may have important implications for the capacity of different groups of commensal bacteria to regulate mucosal and systemic immunity.","Karlsson, H.; Larsson, P.; Wold, A.

Several studies consider the determinants of corporate governance reporting, including external factors such as country-specific legislation and scandals, and internal factors such as financial performance, size and culture. Others consider the consequences of corporate governance reporting, using simple proxies for corporate governance mechanisms such as board composition characteristics to analyse the impact on financial reporting quality and company valuation. Yet the determinants and consequences of corporate governance reporting may be interlinked, and many quantitative studies fail to consider these links and their multiple effects adequately. Poor financial performance, for example, can be both a determinant and a consequence of the underlying governance mechanisms that corporate governance reporting aims to capture. The framework provided in this paper considers both the determinants and consequences of corporate governance and likely links between them, and also considers internal corporate governance mechanisms and the measures that are used as their proxies. In combining these three aspects of corporate governance and showing potential links, the framework offers insights into future research opportunities. The framework can be adapted to any country or organisational setting and also offers the opportunity to consider theories other than agency theory when studying corporate governance disclosures.","de Villiers, Charl; Dimes, Ruth",J Manag Gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471492/,133
40590,Associated posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) to SARS-CoV-2. Case report(),2020-10-08,"This article advances the thesis that disciplinary proceedings may constitute a tool for breaking the rule of law in Poland. In 2017, as part of a package of legal changes to the judiciary, a disciplinary system was created in Poland to ensure that judges were subservient to the political will of the authorities. From the beginning, new disciplinary officers appointed by the Minister of Justice (the Prosecutor General) have targeted judges who disagree with unconstitutional changes to the judiciary. Disciplinary proceedings are by no means repressions that affect judges who demand that other authorities respect the rule of law in Poland. The article discusses, on a step by step basis, the practical mechanisms taken by the political authorities to break the rule of law in Poland. Particular attention is paid to the measures which have been taken concerning the judiciary. The article discusses the judgment of the CJEU on 19 November 2019 in combined cases C-585/18, C-624/18, and C-625/18 and the implementing resolution of the combined Civil, Criminal and Labour and Social Insurance Chambers of the Supreme Court on 23 January 2020 as well as the collapse of the rule of law in Poland from a practical perspective. The analysis of the recent events shows that after the so-called Muzzle Law (A bill amending the Act on the Organization of Ordinary Courts, the Act on the Supreme Court and the Act on the National Council of the Judiciary was submitted on 12 December 2019, and then voted on by the parliamentary majority in the lower house of the Polish Parliament (Sejm) on 20 December 2019.) came into force, the application of the resolution of the combined Civil, Criminal and Labour and Social Insurance Chambers of the Supreme Court on 23 January 2020 implementing the CJEU judgment in the joined cases C-585/18, C-624/18, and C-625/18 of 19 November 2019 can be and, in fact, is penalized by further disciplinary proceedings, which constitutes a real threat to the already weakened rule of law.

In this research note, we examine the role that scientific knowledge and gender played in citizen perceptions of these virus containment policies, both in the general population and among partisans. We find that while a gender gap persists in scientific knowledge, both in the general population and within the parties, women are generally more likely to use this knowledge to inform their policy views on necessary government action during the COVID-19 pandemic.

46310,DETERMINANTS OF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE PATIENT SATISFACTION AFTER TRANSITION TO VIRTUAL VISITS,2021-01-21,"Chemoresistance is one of the main causes of recurrence in bladder cancer patients and leads to poor prognosis. Recently, long non-coding RNAs, like HOXA-AS3, have been reported to regulate chemoresistance in several types of cancer. In this study, we aimed to determine whether HOXA-AS3 can mediate cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer, and its potential mechanism of action. We determined the viability, proliferation, and apoptosis of bladder cancer cells using a CCK-8 assay, EdU staining, and flow cytometry, respectively. We used western blot analysis to assess the expression of markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Notch1. We then confirmed expression of these EMT-related markers by immunofluorescence analysis. We found that hypoxia promoted resistance to cisplatin and upregulated the level of HOXA-AS3 in BC cells. Inhibition of HOXA-AS3 enhanced hypoxia-induced cisplatin sensitivity by regulating EMT and Notch1 in BC cells. A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that HOXA-AS3 directly targets miR-455-5p and that Notch1 was a potential target of miRNA-455-5p. We also found that the positive effect of HOXA-AS3 inhibition on cisplatin resistance and tumorigenesis was alleviated when BC cells were transfected with miR-455-5p. Finally, we showed combining HOXA-AS3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) with cisplatin treatment inhibited tumorigenesis in a BALB/c nu/nu mouse model. Our findings indicate that HOXA-AS3 may function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of miR-455-5p to regulate Notch1 and play an important role in regulating chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity in BC cells. Therefore, HOXA-AS3 may be a novel therapeutic target for treating bladder cancer.","Chen, Dajin; Xie, Shangzhi; Wu, Ying; Cui, Yu; Cai, Ying; Lan, Lan; Yang, Hao; Chen, Jianghua; Chen, Wei",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7907523/,133
46492,ESTUDO OBSERVACIONAL SOBRE ADESÃO AO USO DE MÁSCARAS FACIAIS EM UMA REGIÃO METROPOLITANA,2021-03-06,"BACKGROUND: As the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to evolve, its influence on specific patient populations suffering from chronic disorders becomes increasingly important. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are commonly immunosuppressed with immunomodulators, biologics, and steroids. Therefore, IBD patients have been considered as a risk population for COVID-19. Yet, emerging epidemiologic data may indicate otherwise. It is still unclear, however, how COVID-19 infection affects IBD patients and how seroconversion against the virus might take place depending upon disease states and treatments. We describe a single center cohort of pediatric IBD patients with COVID-19, a subset of whom were tested for seroconversion subsequent to the laboratory test supported infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: The electronic medical records of pediatric IBD patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab based PCR testing were included in the study. The clinical course of IBD, concurrent medications, COVID-19 related symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 testing date, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing date and result were examined. A total of 13 pediatric IBD patients at Texas Children’s Hospital tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patient demographics and specifics of IBD disease and management are detailed in table 1. Management was not altered in any of these patients in response to the positive COVID-19 test. Seven (53.8%) had symptoms including fever, sore throat, fatigue, loss of taste, dizziness, loss of smell, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea; six (46.2%) were asymptomatic. No patients required hospitalization attributed to COVID-19. Of the 13 patients, 6 (46.2%) have been already tested for seroconversion. Four (67.7%) had elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgG of whom 3 patients (50%) had acute and resolved symptoms; one (16.7%) had an ambiguous serology (reactive total IgG and IgM but negative IgG and IgM individually), and one (16.7%) had nonreactive antibody titers. Seroconversion was tested between 0.4, or 4 to 13.7 weeks after initial positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. The close antibody testing at 0.4 weeks had the ambiguous results. Serologic testing for the additional cases is pending. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a cohort of pediatric IBD patients with COVID-19 ranging from 1 week to 4 months after infection whose disease course has not been significantly affected. A large proportion of patients tested for seroconversion were found to mount a detectable IgG based immune response in spite of their medical immunosuppression. More research needs to be performed to evaluate the importance of seroconversion with relation to disease course andCOVID-19 reinfection in pediatric IBD patients.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Cardiac involvement in patients with COVID-19 is still unclear. We made a systematic echocardiographic and biochemical assessment of patients admitted with COVID-19 infection to assess correlation with various clinical outcomes. METHODS: We prospectively assessed 119 consecutive COVID-19 positive in-patients with full echocardiography studies, including left ventricle (LV) systolic function, right ventricle (RV) basal dimension and systolic function using Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE) and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP). We excluded all patients with known left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) prior to admission. We also recorded laboratory biochemical findings including troponin-T, D-dimer and NT-proBNP levels. We carried out correlation analyses of the echocardiography and the laboratory biochemical findings with various clinical outcomes including mortality, length of stay (LOS), admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the three month re-admission rates. RESULTS: 119 patients (38% female); age range 35 to 96 years (mean 71, median 73). 37 (31%) patients died during hospital admission. The mean LOS for surviving patients was 32 days. 20 (17%) patients had significant LSVD (by biplane Simpson method, EF cut off 45%), 31 (26%) patients had RV dilatation, 28 patients (24%) had RV systolic dysfunction by TAPSE and 41 (35%) patients had raised pulmonary artery pressures. There was a weak Pearson’s correlation between mortality and LVSD (0.184, p 0.046), a moderate correlation with RVSD (0.303, p 0.001) and RV dilatation (0.231, p 0.012). Raised troponin-T and NT-proBNP levels correlated moderately with mortality (0.254, p 0.013 and 0.253, p 0.02 respectively). D-dimer levels did not correlate with mortality or any of the other clinical outcomes. Raised troponin-T levels had moderate correlation with admission to ICU and LOS (0.210, p 0.043 and 0.267, p 0.01 respectively). SPAP in isolation did not correlate with any of the clinical outcomes. None of the echocardiography or laboratory biochemical variants correlated with re-admission rates. CONCLUSION: In our cohort of patients with COVID-19 infection there is a weak to moderate mortality correlation with LV function, RV function and RV size. Laboratory biochemical markers especially troponin-T correlated more widely and moderately with clinical outcomes.","Al Barjas, M; Lancioni, M; Eley, A; Catibog, J",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7929047/,133

The efficiency of frameshifting varies widely for different sites, but the factors that determine frameshifting efficiency are not yet fully understood. Previous work has suggested that frameshifting efficiency is related to the resistance of the pseudoknot against mechanical unfolding. We tested this hypothesis by studying the mechanical properties of a panel of pseudoknots with frameshifting efficiencies ranging from 2% to 30%: four pseudoknots from retroviruses, two from luteoviruses, one from a coronavirus, and a nonframeshifting bacteriophage pseudoknot. Using optical tweezers to apply tension across the RNA, we measured the distribution of forces required to unfold each pseudoknot. We found that neither the average unfolding force, nor the unfolding kinetics, nor the parameters describing the energy landscape for mechanical unfolding of the pseudoknot (energy barrier height and distance to the transition state) could be correlated to frameshifting efficiency. These results indicate that the resistance of pseudoknots to mechanical unfolding is not a primary determinant of frameshifting efficiency. However, increased frameshifting efficiency was correlated with an increased tendency to form alternate, incompletely folded structures, suggesting a more complex picture of the role of the pseudoknot involving the conformational dynamics.","Ritchie, Dustin B; Foster, Daniel A N; Woodside, Michael T",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1204114109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22988073/,133
61109,First ever case report of co-occurrence of hobnail variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma and intrathyroid parathyroid adenoma in the same thyroid lobe.,2020-05-05,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by severe lung involvement and hemodynamic alterations. Critical care ultrasonography is vital because it provides real time information for diagnosis and treatment. Suggested protocols for image acquisition and measurements have not yet been evaluated. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted at two centers from 1 April 2020 to 30 May 2020 in adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to the critical care unit. Cardiac and pulmonary evaluations were performed using the ORACLE protocol, specifically designed for this study, to ensure a structured process of image acquisition and limit staff exposure to the infection. RESULTS Eighty-two consecutively admitted patients were evaluated. Most of the patients were males, with a median age of 56 years, and the most frequent comorbidities were hypertension and type 2 diabetes, and 25% of the patients had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. The most frequent ultrasonographic findings were elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (69.5%), E/e' ratio > 14 (29.3%), and right ventricular dilatation (28%) and dysfunction (26.8%). A high rate of fluid responsiveness (82.9%) was observed. The median score (19 points) on pulmonary ultrasound did not reveal any variation between the groups. Elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was associated with higher in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION The ORACLE protocol was a feasible, rapid, and safe bedside tool for hemodynamic and respiratory evaluation of patients with COVID-19. Further studies should be performed on the alteration in pulmonary hemodynamics and right ventricular function and its relationship with outcomes.","García-Cruz, Edgar; Manzur-Sandoval, Daniel; Rascón-Sabido, Rafael; Gopar-Nieto, Rodrigo; Barajas-Campos, Ricardo Leopoldo; Jordán-Ríos, Antonio; Sierra-Lara Martínez, Daniel; Jiménez-Rodríguez, Gian Manuel; Murillo-Ochoa, Adriana Lizeth; Díaz-Méndez, Arturo; Lazcano-Díaz, Emmanuel; Araiza-Garaygordobil, Diego; Cabello-López, Alejandro; Melano-Carranza, Efrén; Bucio-Reta, Eduardo; González-Ruiz, Francisco Javier; Cota-Apodaca, Luis Antonio; Santos-Martínez, Luis Efrén; Fernández-de la Reguera, Guillermo; Ramos-Enríquez, Ángel; Rojas-Velasco, Gustavo; Álvarez-Álvarez, Rolando Joel; Baranda-Tovar, Francisco",Echocardiography,https://doi.org/10.1111/echo.14837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32862474/,133

Although the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic necessitated cancellation of all in-person events across the university, the neonatal nurse practitioner students' learning needs remained the same. METHOD The onsite experience was redesigned for virtual delivery. Procedural content was accomplished through student-led small-group collaborative critical thinking activities surrounding procedural complications, and other faculty-led scenario discussions. RESULTS Students collaborated for a Complications Rounds activity (1-day) that promoted learning about procedural skills from a global perspective including safe techniques, monitoring, risks, and troubleshooting complications. CONCLUSION Procedural content can be achieved when in-person learning is not possible. The Complications Rounds approach can mitigate delays or gaps in practical experiences. Examining complications in-depth increases preparedness, promoting greater awareness of harm prevention when these present in future practice.

METHODS Between September 2014 and March 2016, laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) ureterolithotomy with renal stone extraction or holmium laser lithotripsy under flexible cystoscopy was performed on 15 patients who had concurrent upper ureteral and renal stones. The ureteral stone was treated with LESS ureterolithotomy. After the ureteral stone had been removed, a flexible cystoscope was inserted through one of the laparoscopic ports into the renal pelvis and collecting systems. Renal stones were extracted with a stone basket or broken by a holmium laser and then removed. The perioperative and postoperative data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Patients were followed up postoperatively for evidence of long-term side-effects. RESULTS Nine patients underwent LESS ureterolithotomy and flexible cystoscope-assisted renal stone extraction. Six patients underwent concomitant holmium laser lithotripsy because of larger renal stones. All procedures were completed successfully. The ureteral stones were 15-23 mm in diameter and the renal stones were 4-20 mm in diameter. The mean surgery time was 156 min. Estimated blood loss was 70 ml. Complete stone clearance was confirmed by postoperative imaging in all patients. The median length of hospital stay after surgery was 9.1 days. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred during a mean follow-up of 10.2 months. CONCLUSIONS LESS ureterolithotomy with renal stone extraction or holmium laser lithotripsy under flexible cystoscopy can be considered an effective treatment for patients with concurrent large ureteral and renal stones.","Su, Jian; Zhu, Qingyi; Yuan, Lin; Zhang, Yang; Zhang, Qingling; Wei, Yunfei; Shen, Luming",Scandinavian journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1080/21681805.2017.1310129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28388334/,133
64661,Transdural retrieval of a retropulsed lumbar interbody cage: Technical case report.,2016,"Purpose Some patients undergoing thoracotomy may suffer from chronic post-thoracotomy pain (CPTP). Treatment of CPTP has been a clinical challenge and the underlying mechanisms of CPTP remain elusive. Recently, sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling has been shown to be associated with various pain states but its role in the pathogenesis of CPTP is still unclear. Methods CPTP was induced in rats by thoracotomy. Rats were divided into CPTP group and non-CPTP group based on the mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT). Rats were administered with Shh signaling inhibitor cyclopamine and activator smoothened agonist (SAG), and then evaluated by MWT and cold allodynia testing. The expressions of Shh signaling (Shh ligand, patched and smoothened receptor, Gli transcription factors), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (Trk-B), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt) in rat T4-5 spinal cord dorsal horn (SDH) were detected by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results The expression of Shh signaling significantly increased and the BDNF/TrkB pathway was activated in T4-5 SDH of CPTP rats. Cyclopamine attenuated hyperalgesia and down-regulated the expressions of Gil1, BDNF, p-TrkB, p-PI3K and p-Akt in CPTP rats. SAG induced hyperalgesia in non-CPTP rats and elevated the expressions of Gil1, BDNF, p-TrkB, p-PI3K and p-Akt. Conclusion Shh signaling may contribute to CPTP via activating BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway, and inhibition of Shh signaling may effectively alleviate CPTP.","Yang, Yitian; Wang, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Xuan; You, Shaohua; Feng, Long; Zhang, Yunliang; Shi, Yizheng; Xu, Yuhai; Zhang, Hong",Journal of pain research,https://doi.org/10.2147/jpr.s245515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32765048/,133
67748,Basophil activation test reduces oral food challenges to nuts and sesame.,2020-12-29,"BACKGROUND On 26 March 2020, the South African (SA) government initiated a 21-day national level 5 lockdown which was subsequently eased off and downgraded to level 4 on 1 May and to level 3 on 1 June. The effect of lockdown measures on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is currently uncertain. In this article, we analyse the effects of the lockdown measures on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in one of the epicentres in SA. OBJECTIVES To measure the effects of lockdown measures introduced in SA on SARS-CoV-2 attack rates (ARs, the percentage of individuals who tested positive in a specified time period) in Gauteng Province during a 4-month period (March - June 2020). METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, we used a comprehensive database from an independent pathology laboratory in Gauteng. We analysed trends of positivity rates of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests done during the 4-month period. The ARs are reported over time (unweighted and age-weighted 14-day moving averages) by age groups, gender, and different regions/districts in Gauteng. RESULTS A total of 162 528 tests were performed at a private laboratory between 5 March and 30 June 2020, of which 20 574 were positive (overall AR 12.7%). These positive tests constituted 44.8% of all positive cases in the province (20 574/45 944). Sixty-two percent of all tests were done in June during lockdown level 3. There was an exponential increase in the AR in June (18.3%) when lockdown was eased to level 3, in comparison with 4.2% (March), 2.2% (April) and 3.3% (May). The increase in June was seen in all the age groups, although it was more pronounced in the 21 - 60 years age groups than the younger (0 - 20 years) and older (>60 years) age groups. The AR was significantly higher in males (13.2%) compared with females (12.1%) (χ2 test, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study testify to the rapid increase in ARs resulting from easing of the lockdown regulations, especially to level 3 in June. Of concern is the upward trend in the AR across all age groups, especially <20 years (15.9%), which was not reported in other parts of the world. Population age dynamics should therefore be considered when taking future decisions about lockdown regulations.","Pillai, J; Motloba, P; Motaung, K S C; Ozougwu, L U; Ikalafeng, B K; Marinda, E; Lukhele, M; Basu, D",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,https://doi.org/10.7196/samj.2020.v110i11.15222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33403990/,133

As it has neuromuscular blocking effects, we tested the impact of an intravenous lidocaine infusion on the time course of a rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block. METHODS Fifty-two adults undergoing surgery were randomly allocated to intravenous lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 2 mg/kg/h or physiological saline (control) throughout surgery. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with a target-controlled propofol infusion and sufentanil. After loss of consciousness, rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was given. Neuromuscular transmission was measured using train-of-four (TOF)-watch SX (Organon, Swords Co., Dublin, Ireland) acceleromyography. RESULTS Onset time (to 95% depression of first twitch) was on average 113.9 s (standard deviation 35.3) with lidocaine and 119.5 s (44.9) with saline (P = 0.618). Total recovery time (TOF ratio 0.9) was on average 58.1 min (15.1) with lidocaine and 54.3 min (16.9) with saline (P = 0.394). Clinical duration (until first twitch has recovered to 25%) was on average 33.3 min (7.2) with lidocaine and 30.6 min (8.1) with saline (P = 0.21). Recovery index (time between 25% and 75% recovery of the first twitch) was on average 11.5 min (5.0) with lidocaine and 10.6 min (4.1) with saline (P = 0.458). Recovery time (between 25% recovery of the first twitch and TOF ratio 0.9) was on average 24.8 min (9.3) with lidocaine and 23.2 min (9.2) with saline (P = 0.541). CONCLUSION A continuous intravenous infusion of lidocaine has no impact on the time course of the neuromuscular blockade induced by a standard intubation dose of rocuronium.","Czarnetzki, C; Lysakowski, C; Elia, N; Tramèr, M R",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-6576.2011.02625.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22260297/,133

We examined factors associated with food worry during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We collected survey data on worry about food shortages, worry about contracting COVID-19, and concerns about DHH people staying home and being lonely from April 17 through May 1, 2020, via a bilingual American Sign Language/English online survey platform. The sample consisted of 537 DHH adults living in the United States. We examined the relationship between demographic characteristics and food worry. We used logistic regression and model fitting to predict the likelihood of experiencing food worry. RESULTS The mean (SD) age of survey respondents was 47 (16), and 25% of the sample identified as people of color. Forty-two percent of survey respondents had a high level of food worry. Increased worry about contracting COVID-19 and concerns about DHH people staying home and being lonely among DHH younger adults or those without a college degree predicted food worry. Gender and race/ethnicity did not contribute to the model for food worry. CONCLUSIONS Food worry was explained by multiple, intersecting factors, including demographic variables, worry about contracting COVID-19, and concerns about loneliness. Interventions or programs implemented by DHH-serving organizations as well as government programs, social service providers, and food banks should be fully accessible to subgroups of DHH young adults without a college degree who are at risk for food insecurity.","Engelman, Alina; Paludneviciene, Raylene; Wagner, Kathryn; Jacobs, Katja; Kushalnagar, Poorna",Public health reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033354920974666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33296264/,133

70301,Treatment of two Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) with severe injuries and their subsequent release into the wild: a case report.,2021-03-20,"The discovery of the ionizing effect of strong electric fields in the order of volts per Ångstrom in the early 1950s eventually led to the development of field ionization-mass spectrometry (FI-MS). Due to the very low ion currents, and thus, limited by the instrumentation of the 1960s, it took some time for the, by then, new technique to become adopted for analytical applications. In FI-MS, volatile or at least vaporizable samples mainly deliver molecular ions, and consequently, mass spectra showing no or at least minor numbers of fragment ion signals. The next major breakthrough was achieved by overcoming the need to evaporate the analyte prior to ionization. This was accomplished in the early 1970s by simply depositing the samples onto the field emitter and led to field desorption-mass spectrometry (FD-MS). With FD-MS, a desorption ionization method had become available that paved the road to the mass spectral analysis of larger molecules of low to high polarity and even of organic salts. In FD-MS, all of these analytes deliver spectra with no or at least few fragment ion peaks. The last milestone was the development of liquid injection field desorption/ionization (LIFDI) in the early 2000s that allows for sample deposition under the exclusion of atmospheric oxygen and water. In addition to sampling under inert conditions, LIFDI also enables more robust and quicker operation than classical FI-MS and FD-MS procedures. The development and applications of FI, FD, and LIFDI had mutual interference with the mass analyzers that were used in combination with these methods. Vice versa, the demand for using these techniques on other than magnetic sector instruments has effectuated their adaptation to different types of modern mass analyzers. The journey started with magnetic sector instruments, almost skipped quadrupole analyzers, encompassed Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) and orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight (oaTOF) analyzers, and finally arrived at Orbitraps. Even interfaces for continuous-flow LIFDI have been realized. Even though being niche techniques to some degree, one may be confident that FI, FD, and LIFDI have a promising future ahead of them.

However, conventional CT (C CT) has a significantly higher radiation dose (RD) than plain radiography. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of ultra-low-dose CT (ULDCT) protocol for ankle fractures. METHODS Ninety-eight consecutive patients who had ankle CT for suspected ankle fracture were included in our prospective study. C CT and ULDCT protocols were simultaneously performed on these 98 patients. Two observers independently evaluated ULDCT and C CT images. The effective RD of the ULDCT and C CT groups was calculated. RESULTS The interobserver agreement was 1 (perfect). ULDCT and C CT group images showed no significant difference in image quality. The effective RD of the ULDCT was significantly lower than the C CT (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS By evaluating the results of this study, ULDCT proved to be a reliable diagnostic imaging method for fractures of the ankle. The satisfactory diagnostic image quality of the ULDCT protocol provides promising results.

71166,Predominant DNMT and TET mediate effects of allergen on the human bronchial epithelium in a controlled air pollution exposure study.,2020-10-15,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT Manual contouring of spinal rods is often required intraoperatively for proper alignment of the rods within the pedicle screw heads. Residual misalignments are frequently reduced by using dedicated reduction devices. The forces exerted by these devices, however, are uncontrolled and may lead to excessive reaction forces. As a consequence, screw pullout might be provoked and surrounding tissue may experience unfavorable biomechanical loads. The corresponding loads and induced tissue deformations are however not well identified. Additionally, whether the forced reduction alters the biomechanical behavior of the lumbar spine during physiological movements postoperatively, remains unexplored. PURPOSE To predict whether the reduction of misaligned posterior instrumentation might result in clinical complications directly after reduction and during a subsequent physiological flexion movement STUDY DESIGN: Finite element analysis METHODS: A patient-specific, total lumbar (L1-S1) spine finite element model was available from previous research. The model consists of poro-elastic intervertebral discs with Pfirrmann grade-dependent material parameters, with linear elastic bone tissue with stiffness values related to the local bone density, and with the seven major ligaments per spinal motion segment described as nonlinear materials. Titanium instrumentation was implemented in this model to simulate a L4, L5, and S1 posterolateral fusion. Next, coronal and sagittal misalignments of 6 millimeters each were introduced between the rod and the screw head at L4. These misalignments were computationally reduced and a physiological flexion movement of 15° was prescribed. Non-instrumented and well-aligned instrumented models were used as control groups. RESULTS Pulling forces up to 1.0 kN were required to correct the induced misalignments of 6 millimeters. These forces affected the posture of the total lumbar spine, as motion segments were predicted to rotate up to 3 degrees and rotations propagated proximally to and even affect the L1-2 level. The facet contact pressures in the corrected misaligned models were asymmetrical suggesting non-physiological joint loading in the misaligned models. In addition, the discs and vertebrae experienced abnormally high forces as a result of the correction procedure. These effects were more pronounced after a 15° flexion movement following forced reduction. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study indicate that the correction of misaligned posterior instrumentation can result in high forces at the screws consistent with those reported to cause screw pullout, and may cause high tissue strains in adjacent and downstream spinal segments. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Proper alignment of spinal posterior instrumentation may reduce clinical complications secondary to unfavorable biomechanics.","Loenen, Arjan C Y; Noriega, David C; Wills, Carlos Ruiz; Noailly, Jérôme; Nunley, Pierce D; Kirchner, Rainer; Ito, Keita; van Rietbergen, Bert",The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spinee.2020.09.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007470/,133
72382,Radiation-induced glioblastoma of the conus medullaris from radiation treatment of cervical cancer.,2020-12-17,"INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, is a predominantly respiratory tract infection with the capacity to affect multiple organ systems. Abnormal liver tests, mainly transaminase elevations, have been reported in hospitalized patients. We describe a syndrome of cholangiopathy in patients recovering from severe COVID-19 characterized by marked elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) accompanied by evidence of bile duct injury on imaging. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted to our institution from March 1, 2020, to August 15, 2020, on whom the hepatology service was consulted for abnormal liver tests. Bile duct injury was identified by abnormal liver tests with serum ALP > 3x upper limit of normal and abnormal findings on magnetic resonance cholangiopacreatography. Clinical, laboratory, radiological, and histological findings were recorded in a Research Electronic Data Capture database. RESULTS Twelve patients were identified, 11 men and 1 woman, with a mean age of 58 years. Mean time from COVID-19 diagnosis to diagnosis of cholangiopathy was 118 days. Peak median serum alanine aminotransferase was 661 U/L and peak median serum ALP was 1855 U/L. Marked elevations of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and D-dimers were common. Magnetic resonance cholangiopacreatography findings included beading of intrahepatic ducts (11/12, 92%), bile duct wall thickening with enhancement (7/12, 58%), and peribiliary diffusion high signal (10/12, 83%). Liver biopsy in 4 patients showed acute and/or chronic large duct obstruction without clear bile duct loss. Progressive biliary tract damage has been demonstrated radiographically. Five patients were referred for consideration of liver transplantation after experiencing persistent jaundice, hepatic insufficiency, and/or recurrent bacterial cholangitis.

72618,Modified tension band wiring of patellar fracture as a technique to minimize postoperative complications: A case report.,2020-03-01,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS Animal data and limited clinical evidence suggest a low incidence of infection following transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). However, a systematic microbiological evaluation has not yet been carried out. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to evaluate the extent of microbiological contamination of the peritoneal cavity caused by the transvaginal access for NOTES and the impact of preoperative vaginal disinfection on vaginal colonization. PATIENTS AND METHODS Consecutive female patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis were offered either transvaginal rigid-hybrid cholecystectomy (tvCCE) or conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients who opted for tvCCE were prospectively evaluated between February and June 2010. Disinfection in patients undergoing tvCCE included hexetidine tablets and octenidine applied vaginally. All patients received a single dose of perioperative cefuroxime. Swabs were obtained from the posterior fornix and the peritoneal cavity at different intervals. RESULTS Of 32 patients, 27 (84 %) opted to undergo tvCCE. One patient (4 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.7 % - 18.3 %) had a positive bacterial culture in the Douglas pouch prior to transvaginal access compared with two patients (7 %; 95 %CI 2.1 % - 23.4 %) following colpotomy closure (P = 1.000). Vaginal disinfection significantly decreased vaginal bacterial load (P = 0.001) and bacterial growth in routine cultures (P < 0.001); in 16 patients (59 %; 95 %CI 40.7 % - 75.5 %) vaginal swabs were sterile after disinfection. No postoperative surgical site infections occurred (95 %CI 0 % - 12.5 %). CONCLUSIONS In selected patients and following vaginal antisepsis, transvaginal access for NOTES is associated with microbiological contamination of the peritoneal cavity in a minority of patients, indicating a low risk of peritoneal contamination caused by the transvaginal access.","Linke, G R; Tarantino, I; Bruderer, T; Celeiro, J; Warschkow, R; Tarr, P E; Müller-Stich, B P; Zerz, A",Endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1309390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22528675/,133
73112,Respiratory viral infections in hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplant recipients.,2011,"OBJECTIVE To validate the Martini staging system for post-operative RUF utilizing data from previous studies to determine whether it can accurately predict post-operative success rate. METHODS A systematic search of peer-reviewed studies was conducted through January, 2020. The primary inclusion criteria for the studies were studies that evaluated outcomes based on the etiology of the fistula (i.e. radiotherapy/ablation (RA) vs non-radiotherapy/ablation (NRA). Martini RUF classification was utilized for the subgroup analysis. RESULTS Out of 1948 papers, 7 studies with a total of 490 patients (251 in RA vs 239 NRA) were included in this study. Receiving RA increased the risk of permanent bowel diversion by 11.1 folds, eventual fistula recurrence by 9.1 folds, and post-op urinary incontinence (UI) by 2.6 folds. Similarly, compared to a Grade 0 fistula, a Grade I fistula increased the risk of permanent bowel diversion by 9.1 folds, fistula recurrence by 20 folds, and post-op UI by 2.7 folds. There were some valuable variables that were not captured by the Martini classification. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the Martini classification system is efficacious in stratifying post-op complications from RUF repair based on the grade and etiology; however, it is limited in application. There is an opportunity for the development of more comprehensive staging systems in this domain.","Mishra, Kirtishri; Mahran, Amr; Abboud, Bissan; Bukavina, Laura; Elshafei, Ahmed; Ray, Al; Fernstrum, Austin; Abboud, Rayan; Elgammal, Mohammed; Zhao, Lee C; Gupta, Shubham",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2020.08.047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916190/,133

This disease causes decrease productivity of cattle. Although considerable research has been done on the role of C. fetus on female fertility, little is known about the effect on bulls. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of C. fetus subsp. fetus (Cff) and C. fetus subsp. venerealis (Cfv) on bull sperm quality. Samples of frozen semen (n = 29 straws) were each distributed into three groups: two of them incubated with the microorganism (Cff, Cfv) and a control group. The proportions of live spermatozoa, with functional membrane and true acrosomal reaction in control group were significantly (P < 0.01) greater than those observed in Cff and Cfv groups. However, no significant differences (P > 0.05) were found in sperm chromatin structure among treatments. In adhesion assay, proportions of spermatozoa with adhered Campylobacter were similar for both subspecies. Results confirm that Cff and Cfv have the same ability to bind in an irreversible way to bull spermatozoa and to affect sperm quality. It is proposed that adherence could be considered as the main cause of sperm alterations, and also an important step of pathogenesis and venereal transmission.","Inés, Cagnoli Claudia; Laura, Chiapparrone María; Santiago, Cacciato Claudio; Gastón, Rodríguez Marcelo; Florencio, Aller Juan; María Del Carmen, Catena",Microbial pathogenesis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916242/,133

Methods: A representative US sample (N = 362) completed an online survey about potential risk/protective factors and health behaviors prior to the pandemic and after implemented/recommended restrictions. We assessed change in perceived health behaviors prior to and following introduction of COVID-19. We conducted hierarchical linear regression to explore and identify risk/protective factors related to physical activity, diet quality, and social isolation. Results: There have been substantial decreases in physical activity and increases in sedentary behavior and social isolation, but no changes in diet quality since COVID-19. We identified modifiable and non-modifiable factors associated with each health behavior. Conclusions: Negative effects indicate the need for universal intervention to promote health behaviors. Inequalities in health behaviors among vulnerable populations may be exacerbated since COVID-19, suggesting need for targeted invention. Social support may be a mechanism to promote health behaviors. We suggest scaling out effective health behavior interventions with the same intensity in which physical distancing recommendations were implemented.","Weaver, Raven H; Jackson, Alexandra; Lanigan, Jane; Power, Thomas G; Anderson, Alana; Cox, Anne E; Eddy, Linda; Parker, Louise; Sano, Yoshie; Weybright, Elizabeth",American journal of health behavior,https://doi.org/10.5993/ajhb.45.1.4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33402237/,133
75833,Retroperitoneal mass presenting as recurrent inguinal hernia: A case report.,2016,"PURPOSE To compare the CFR-PEEK plates with conventional plates in fracture fixation with regards to clinical and radiological outcomes and complications. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in four online databases independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane methodology for systematic reviews. The identified relevant studies were assessed against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Independent data extraction and assessment of risk of bias and study quality was carried out. RESULTS Nine studies (patient n = 361) out of 6594 records were included for analysis: 2 RCTs (n = 63), 3 prospective cohort studies (n = 151), and 4 retrospective cohort studies (n = 147). Studies were grouped per anatomic area of fixation. Four studies (n = 200) examined fixation of proximal humerus fractures. Two studies (n = 74) examined fixation of distal radius fractures. Two studies (n = 53) assessed outcomes of fixation of distal femur fractures. One study (n = 87) assessed the outcomes of fixation of ankle fractures. All nine studies reported very high union rates (from 91% in distal femur to 100% in upper limb) for the CFR-PEEK plate groups and low complication rates. There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes, and rate of complications as compared to the conventional plate groups. CONCLUSION CFR-PEEK plates have high union rates in extremity fracture fixation similar to conventional plates with comparable good clinical outcomes and a very low and comparable rate of complications. Considering their advantages, CFR-PEEK plates seem to be valid alternative to conventional plating.","Chloros, George D; Prodromidis, Apostolos D; Wilson, Jo; Giannoudis, Peter V",European journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the European Trauma Society,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00068-021-01778-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34487201/,133

One of the heavily utilized measures during this pandemic is vitamin C (aka ascorbic acid). Unfortunately, vitamin C has been associated with glucose measurement interference and thus this study highlights the elevated levels of blood glucose correlated with the presence of vitamin C interference. METHODOLOGY Thirty samples were selected randomly and the blood glucose were measured prior and post the addition of spiked standard concentrations of vitamin C. The interference of vitamin C with glucose readings in COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated and observed employing the Auto Chemistry Analyzer machine. RESULTS The addition of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) standards (spikes) into the isolated samples shows a correlated increment in the reading measures. Thereafter, the increments of Random Blood Sugar (RBS) readings after being spiked with the vitamin C standards shows a logarithmic correlation with good interesting R-squared (R2 = 0.9921). CONCLUSIONS The authors find that the presence of vitamin C in blood actively and significantly alters the glucose level readings especially with the highly consumption of vitamin C during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Al-Obaidi, Zaid Mahdi Jaber; Hussain, Yasmeen Ali; Ali, Alaa A; Al-Rekabi, Mohammed Dakhil",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33690202/,133

RECENT FINDINGS Although several studies have shown that catheter-directed therapy reduces clot burden and may improve clinical outcomes, the multicenter randomized controlled ATTRACT trial showed no difference in PTS or quality of life at 2 years between patients treated with pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (PCDT) and those treated with anticoagulation alone, and a higher major bleeding rate in the PCDT group. PCDT is not indicated for most patients diagnosed with lower extremity DVT. Since PCDT may benefit patients with iliofemoral DVT, intervention can be considered in this subset of patients if they are at low risk of bleeding.","Winokur, Ronald S; Sista, Akhilesh K",Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11936-018-0663-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30084056/,133

The authors conduct a systematic review on endovascular treatment methods of mycotic aneurysms. METHODS A systematic literature review was performed using the PubMed and MEDLINE databases for studies published between 1986 and 2020. All studies assessing outcomes related to endovascular Onyx embolization, NBCA embolization, or coiling were included. RESULTS A total of 73 studies were ultimately selected, including 180 (67% male) patients comprising 243 aneurysms treated endovascularly. The mean age was 38.2 ± 17.6 years, and the most common symptom on presentation is headache (31%). Most aneurysms were located on the MCA (52.5%), and over half presented with rupture (53.8%). Coiling was the most commonly employed technique (50.4%), and obliteration rates were comparable across coiling, NBCA, and Onyx (99.1%, 100%, 100%, respectively). Complication rates were also comparable (4.3% vs 15.2% vs 8.1%). CONCLUSION Embolization for infectious intracranial aneurysm (IIAs) appears to be an effective treatment option for mycotic aneurysms. Embolization rates were comparable between coiling, NBCA, and onyx embolization. Non-inferiority among these modalities cannot be demonstrated given the retrospective nature of this review, evolution of endovascular techniques over the years, and changes in treatment paradigms in the last two decades. Ideally, further prospective research will be needed to find which treatment method offers the lowest complication rates and the best outcomes for patients with mycotic aneurysms.","Desai, Bhargav; Soldozy, Sauson; Desai, Harshal; Kumar, Jeyan; Shah, Smit; Raper, Daniel M; Park, Min S",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818695/,133
77331,Necessary Infrastructure of Infection Prevention and Healthcare Epidemiology Programs: A Review.,2016,"BACKGROUND The ideal surgical procedure for interstitial pregnancy remains undetermined. The aim of this study was to assess whether surgical method is a factor in predicting subsequent pregnancy in women with interstitial pregnancy who underwent laparoscopic cornuostomy or laparoscopic wedge resection. METHODS Medical records of all women with interstitial pregnancy who underwent laparoscopic cornuostomy or laparoscopic wedge resection between March 2008 and October 2017 in a medical center were reviewed. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify factors predicting subsequent pregnancy. RESULTS Forty patients underwent laparoscopic cornuostomy (n = 14) or laparoscopic wedge resection (n = 26) for the treatment of interstitial pregnancy. Twelve women become pregnant during follow-up. Laparoscopic cornuostomy was associated with shorter operation time (coefficient = -19.1 minutes, 95% CI = -36.9 to -1.3 minutes, p = 0.04, multivariable analysis) than that of laparoscopic wedge resection. Furthermore, laparoscopic cornuostomy (hazard ratio = 6.3, p = 0.03), parity (hazard ratio = 0.18, p = 0.008), and preoperative rupture of the cornus (hazard ratio = 13.3, p = 0.005) were independent predictors of subsequent pregnancy. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic cornuostomy was associated with a higher probability of subsequent pregnancy and a shorter operation time. Thus, compared with laparoscopic wedge resection, laparoscopic cornuostomy might be a better surgical procedure for women with interstitial pregnancy, particularly for women who wish to become pregnant later. However, because of the retrospective nature and small sample size of this study, some well-defined/designed prospective studies including more patients are needed to verify our results.","Chen, Pei-Ling; Lin, Ho-Hsiung; Hsiao, Sheng-Mou",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839505/,133

METHODS Altogether 105 PM subjects were recruited with fifty-eight eyes categorized as group LC + SH and sixty eyes as group LC + mCNV. LCs were categorized into stellate and linear subtypes. Eye fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography were performed. Clinical demographic data, PM maculopathy, peripapillary atrophy, and macular choroidal thickness (mCT) were documented. RESULTS Significant differences in age, gender, BCVA, and PM atrophies were observed between LC + SH and LC + mCNV groups. The stellate LC was more common in elder subjects with more severe chorioretinal atrophy and thinner mCT compared with linear LCs (P < 0.05). The mCT in group LC + SH was significantly larger than group LC + CNV (P < 0.001), especially in temporal, inferior, and superior locations of macula. The mCT showed correlation with age (P < 0.001)with a decreasing rate of 0.696 μm/year. CONCLUSIONS SH tended to initially occur in younger subjects with linear LCs. mCNV was more common in elder subjects with severe chorioretinal atrophy. Stellate LCs were associated with the worse PM lesions.","Ren, Peifang; Lu, Li; Tang, Xuyuan; Lu, Hong; Zhao, Yuan; Lou, Dinghua; Han, Wei",Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00417-020-04778-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648154/,133
77523,A Paucity of Outcomes.,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause serious illness in some people resulting in admission to intensive care units (ICU) and frequently, ventilatory support for acute respiratory failure. Evaluating ICU care, and what is effective in improving outcomes for these patients is critical. Care bundles, a small set of evidence-based interventions, delivered together consistently, may improve patient outcomes. To identify the extent of the available evidence on the use of care bundles in patients with COVID-19 in the ICU, the World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned a scoping review to inform WHO guideline discussions. This review does not assess the effectiveness of the findings, assess risk of bias, or assess the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). As this review was commissioned to inform guideline discussions, it was done rapidly over a three-week period from 26 October to 18 November 2020. OBJECTIVES To identify and describe the available evidence on the use of care bundles in the ICU for patients with COVID-19 or related conditions (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) viral pneumonia or pneumonitis), or both. In carrying out the review the focus was on characterising the evidence base and not evaluating the effectiveness or safety of the care bundles or their component parts. SEARCH METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 26 October 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA Studies of all designs that reported on patients who are critically ill with COVID-19, ARDS, viral pneumonia or pneumonitis, in the ICU setting, where a care bundle was implemented in providing care, were eligible for inclusion. One review author (VS) screened all records on title and abstract. A second review author (DR) checked 20% of excluded and included records; agreement was 99.4% and 100% respectively on exclude/include decisions. Two review authors (VS and DR) independently screened all records at full-text level. VS and DR resolved any disagreements through discussion and consensus, or referral to a third review author (AN) as required. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One review author (VS) extracted the data and a second review author (DR) checked 20% of this for accuracy. As the review was not designed to synthesise effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterise the certainty of the evidence (GRADE), we mapped the extracted data and presented them in tabular format based on the patient condition; that is patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, patients with ARDS, patients with any influenza or viral pneumonia, patients with severe respiratory failure, and patients with mixed conditions. We have also provided a narrative summary of the findings from the included studies. MAIN RESULTS We included 21 studies and identified three ongoing studies. The studies were of variable designs and included a systematic review of standardised approaches to caring for critically ill patients in ICU, including but not exclusive to care bundles (1 study), a randomised trial (1 study), prospective and retrospective cohort studies (4 studies), before and after studies (7 studies), observational quality improvement reports (4 studies), case series/case reports (3 studies) and audit (1 study). The studies were conducted in eight countries, most commonly China (5 studies) and the USA (4 studies), were published between 1999 and 2020, and involved over 2000 participants in total. Studies categorised participant conditions patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (7 studies), patients with ARDS (7 studies), patients with another influenza or viral pneumonia (5 studies), patients with severe respiratory failure (1 study), and patients with mixed conditions (1 study). The care bundles described in the studies involved multiple diverse practices. Guidance on ventilator settings (10 studies), restrictive fluid management (8 studies), sedation (7 studies) and prone positioning (7 studies) were identified most frequently, while only one study mentioned chest X-ray. None of the included studies reported the prespecified outcomes ICU-acquired weakness (muscle wasting, weight loss) and users' experience adapting care bundles. Of the remaining prespecified outcomes, 14 studies reported death in ICU, nine reported days of ventilation (or ventilator-free days), nine reported length of stay in ICU in days, five reported death in hospital, three reported length of stay in hospital in days, and three reported adherence to the bundle. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This scoping review has identified 21 studies on care bundle use in critically ill patients in ICU with COVID-19, ARDS, viral influenza or pneumonia and severe respiratory failure. The data for patients with COVID-19 specifically are limited, derived mainly from observational quality improvement or clinical experiential accounts. Research is required, urgently, to further assess care bundle use and optimal components of these bundles in this patient cohort. The care bundles described were also varied, with guidance on ventilator settings described in 10 care bundles, while chest X-ray was part mentioned in one care bundle in one study only. None of the studies identified in this scoping review measured users' experience of adapting care bundles. Optimising care bundle implementation requires that the components of the care bundle are collectively and consistently applied. Data on challenges, barriers and facilitators to implementation are needed. A formal synthesis of the outcome data presented in this review and a critical appraisal of the evidence is required by a subsequent effectiveness review. This subsequent review should further explore effect estimates across the included studies.","Smith, Valerie; Devane, Declan; Nichol, Alistair; Roche, David",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013819; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33348427/,133

With the pandemic outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an on-site diagnostic system-integrated airborne pathogen-monitoring machine is recommended by experts for preventing and controlling the early stage β-coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread. In this work, a small-volume rotating microfluidic fluorescence chip-integrated aerosol SARS-CoV-2 sampling system was constructed to satisfy the demand for rapid on-site sample collection and detection of SARS-CoV-2. The rotating microfluidic fluorescence system with small volume has very high sensitivity in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (detection limit of 10 copies/μL with the shortest Ct value of 15 min), which is comparable to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The precision variation coefficients within/between batches are very low [coefficient of variation (CV) % ≤ 5.0%]. Our work has passed the comprehensive inspection of the microfluidic chip performance by the Shanghai Medical Device Testing Institute [National Medical Inspection (Design) no. 4408] and successfully tested 115 clinical samples. The integrated system exhibits 100% specificity, high sensitivity (10 copies/μL), and good precision (CV % ≤ 5.0%) in the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2, thus realizing rapid monitoring and diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid on-site.","Xiong, Huiwen; Ye, Xin; Li, Yang; Qi, Jun; Fang, Xueen; Kong, Jilie",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c05154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33635067/,133

84409,Partnering with Patients and Communities to Improve Prehospital Anaphylaxis Care.,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND Despite the fact that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been developed and used to treat acute and urgent illness for many thousands of years. TCM has been widely perceived in western societies that TCM may only be effective to treat chronic diseases. The aim of this article is to provide some scientific evidence regarding the application of TCM in emergency medicine and its future potential. METHODS MULTIPLE DATABASES (PUBMED, PROQUEST, ACADEMIC SEARCH ELITE AND SCIENCE DIRECT) WERE SEARCHED USING THE TERMS: Traditional Chinese Medicine/ Chinese Medicine, Emergency Medicine, China. In addition, three leading TCM Journals in China were searched via Oriprobe Information Services for relevant articles (published from 1990-2012). Particular attention was paid to those articles that are related to TCM treatments or combined medicine in dealing with intensive and critical care. RESULTS TCM is a systematic traditional macro medicine. The clinical practice of TCM is guided by the TCM theoretical framework - a methodology founded thousands of years ago. As the methodologies between TCM and Biomedicine are significantly different, it provides an opportunity to combine two medicines, in order to achieve clinical efficacy. Nowadays, combined medicine has become a common clinical model particular in TCM hospitals in China. CONCLUSIONS It is evident that TCM can provide some assistance in emergency although to combine them in practice is still its infant form and is mainly at TCM hospitals in China. The future effort could be put into TCM research, both in laboratories and clinics, with high quality designs, so that TCM could be better understood and then applied in emergency medicine.","He, Jun; Hou, Xiang-Yu",World journal of emergency medicine,https://doi.org/10.5847/wjem.j.1920-8642.2013.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25215100/,133

87976,What are key symptoms to be captured for preventing physician's underestimation of asthma control?,2020-08-17,"In 2016 the World Health Organization developed a plan for viral hepatitis elimination by 2030. Globally, control of Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) are the most challenging aspects of viral hepatitis elimination. In many developed countries elimination of HBV could be targeted to special populations mostly immigrants from low resource settings. Elimination of HCV however remains a challenge globally. Barriers to HCV elimination include high cost of medications and the ability to engage specific at-risk populations as well as individuals who are out of medical care. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, treatment access and screening has been further negatively impacted by social distancing rules and COVID-19 related anxieties. This threatens to throw most countries off course in their elimination efforts. Prior to the pandemic, some states in the US had had scaled up their elimination efforts with plans to ramp up testing and treatment using Netflix like payment models for HCV DAAs (Direct Acting Antiviral Drugs). Most of these efforts have stalled on account of the health system's focus on COVID-19 control. To prevent further delays in achieving elimination targets, programs would need to explore new models of care that address COVID-19 related access hurdles. Systems that leverage technologies like telemedicine and self-testing could help maintain treatment levels. Mathematical models estimate that Covid-19-related delays in 2020 could lead to 44,800 hepatocellular cancers and 72,300 liver-related deaths over the next decade.","Sowah, Leonard; Chiou, Christine",AIDS research and human retroviruses,https://doi.org/10.1089/aid.2020.0301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33913731/,133

In this study, we investigated differences in codon usage preferences among the highly mutable single strain RNA viruses which infect vertebrate or invertebrate hosts, respectively. We incorporate principal component analysis (PCA) and k-mean methods to clustering viruses infected with different type of hosts. The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) indices of all genes in 32 RNA viruses were calculated, and the correlation of the RSCU indices among different viruses was analyzed by the PCA. Our results show a positive correlation in codon usage preferences among viruses that target the same host category. Results of k-means clustering analysis further confirmed the statistical significance of this study, demonstrating that viruses infecting vertebrate hosts have different codon usage preferences to those of invertebrate viruses. Based on the analysis of the effective number of codons (ENC) in relation to the GC-content at the synonymous third codon position (GC3s), we further identified that mutational pressure was the dominant evolution driving force in making the different codon usage preferences. This study suggests a new and effective way to characterize host-dependent RNA viruses based on the codon usage pattern.","Su, Ming-Wei; Lin, Hsiu-Man; Yuan, Hanna S; Chu, Woei-Chyn",Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1089/cmb.2009.0046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19958082/,133

Here we report that adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction-mediated depletion of Hap1, the first identified huntingtin-associated protein, in adult HD knock-in (KI) mouse brains leads to selective neuronal loss in the striatum. Further, Hap1 depletion-mediated neuronal loss via AAV transduction requires the presence of mutant HTT. Rhes, a GTPase that is enriched in the striatum and sumoylates mutant HTT to mediate neurotoxicity, binds more N-terminal HTT when Hap1 is deficient. Consistently, more soluble and sumoylated N-terminal HTT is presented in HD KI mouse striatum when HAP1 is absent. Our findings suggest that both Rhes and Hap1 as well as cellular stress contribute to the preferential neurodegeneration in HD, highlighting the involvement of multiple factors in selective neurodegeneration.","Liu, Qiong; Cheng, Siying; Yang, Huiming; Zhu, Louyin; Pan, Yongcheng; Jing, Liang; Tang, Beisha; Li, Shihua; Li, Xiao-Jiang",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2002283117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747555/,133

Utilizing the ORBIT model for behavioral intervention development, we defined and refined a behavioral intervention for providers, Tailored Motivational Interviewing (TMI), to improve provider competence in previous studies (Phase 1a and 1b). The current study focuses on ORBIT Phase 2a-proof of concept. We hypothesized that TMI would be acceptable and feasible and would show a signal of efficacy of improving and maintaining community health worker (CHW) MI competence scores using an innovative statistical method for small N proof-of-concept studies. Method: Longitudinal data were collected from 19 CHWs at 16 youth HIV agencies. CHWs from 8 sites were assigned to the TMI group per the cofunders request. The remaining 8 sites were randomly assigned to TMI or services as usual. MI competence was assessed at baseline and up to 15 times over 2 years. Random coefficient models were utilized to examine time trajectories of competence scores and the impact of the intervention on competence trajectories. Semistructured interviews were conducted to determine barriers and facilitators of TMI. Results: Competence scores in the TMI group significantly increased while the scores of the control group significantly decreased. Further analysis of the intervention group demonstrated that scores significantly increased during the first 3 months after initial workshop and was sustained through the end of the study. Qualitative findings revealed insufficient time and competing priorities as perceived barriers whereas integrating MI into routine agency practices and ongoing training might facilitate implementation. Conclusions: Following a successful proof-of-concept, the next step is a fully randomized pilot study of TMI relative to a control condition in preparation for a stepped-wedge cluster randomized full scale trial.

Herein, we demonstrate a sheathless microflow cytometer which integrates a bulk standing acoustic wave based microchip capable of three dimensional cell focusing. Flow cytometry was successfully demonstrated using this system with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 2.16% with standard calibration beads. The sensitivities calibrated by rainbow beads are 518 MEFL in FITC channel and 264 MEPE in PE channels respectively. The linearities are more than 99% in both channels. The capability of the proposed microflow cytometer is further demonstrated by immunologically labeled leukocytes differentiation in blood. This acoustic-based microflow cytometer did not require any sheath flows or complex structures and can be mass produced. Because of the simple fluid channel, the chip can be easily made pipeless, disposable for applications requiring no cross contamination. Moreover, with the gentle and bio-compatible acoustic waves used, this technique is expected to maintain the viability of cells and other bioparticles. This article is protected by copyright.

Social distancing may generate stress, anxiety, and depression. Understanding the psychosocial consequences of COVID19 during social distancing may help decision-makers to take suitable decisions that help in increasing awareness. Evaluate the psychosocial consequences of COVID-19 pandemic during the social distancing period and explore the relationship between social media use and psychological stress during COVID-19 outbreak among Najran city population. Research design is descriptive correlational research design. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A snowball sampling technique, was used to recruit participants live in Najran city during the COVID-19 pandemic (1508 participant). RESULTS A statistically significant differences (P<0.05) are observed between Saudi and non-Saudi participants in all social aspects assessed except for time spent on social media. In addition, a high mean of depression, stress, and anxiety subscale scores are observed in non-Saudi compared to the Saudi participants with statistically significant differences (p=0.000). As well as high DASS-21 total scores in non-Saudi compared to the Saudi participants. Also, there are positive statistically significant correlations (≤0.05) between participants' time spent in social media and their depression, stress, anxiety, and total DASS scores during the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSION The findings of the present study indicate that COVID-19 pandemic generates stress, anxiety and depression among Najran population especially, non-Saudi. This poor psychological condition is exaggerated with prolonged social media use. COVID-19 also has negative impact on social wellbeing and use of social media cannot replace direct contact with friends. The current study results may be utilized to formulate interventions that enhance psychosocial health and resilience during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Al-Qahtani, Awad Mohammed; Elgzar, Wafaa Taha; Ibrahim, Heba Abdel-Fatah",Psychiatria Danubina,https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796799/,133

We changed apical and protease-like domain residues by introducing point mutations and adding or removing glycosylation signals, and we then examined the interactions of those mutant TfRs with the capsids. Most substitutions had little effect on virus binding and uptake. However, mutations of several sites in the apical domain of the receptor either prevented binding to the capsids or reduced the affinity of receptor binding to various degrees. Glycans within the virus binding face of the apical domain also controlled capsid binding. CPV, but not the related feline parvovirus, could use receptors containing a canine TfR-specific glycosylation to mediate efficient infection, while addition of other N-linked glycosylation sites into the virus binding face of the feline apical domain reduced or eliminated both binding and infection. Replacement of critical feline TfR residue 221 with every amino acid had effects on binding and infection which were significantly associated with the biochemical properties of the residue replaced. Receptors with reduced affinities mostly showed proportional changes in their ability to mediate infection. Testing feline TfR variants for their binding and uptake patterns in cells showed that low-affinity versions bound fewer capsids and also differed in attachment to the cell surface and filopodia, but transport to the perinuclear endosome was similar.","Goodman, Laura B; Lyi, Sangbom M; Johnson, Natalie C; Cifuente, Javier O; Hafenstein, Susan L; Parrish, Colin R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02623-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20200243/,133

COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection-induced acute infectious disease, which is featured by universal susceptibility and strong infectivity, and SHS (a status of low quality health) refers to a status of low-quality health. COVID-19 has gradually developed into a global pandemic, making the public in a high stress situation in physiological, psychological and social states in the short term. METHODS From March 6 to 11, 2020, a large-scale cross-sectional survey was conducted by convenient sampling, and SHS assessment scale was used in the questionnaire. The ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors affecting SHS. RESULTS In this study, 17,078 questionnaires were delivered with 16,820 effective questionnaires collected, and 10,715 subjects (63.7%) were found with SHS, with moderate SHS primarily. Physiological sub-scale scored the highest, followed by psychological and social sub-scales. Ordinal logistic regression analysis indicated that man, only-child, workers and farmers were risk factors of SHS. Protective factors of SHS included living in rural areas and townships, laid-off retirees and education degree. CONCLUSION It shows many people in China place in a poor health status during COVID-19 pandemic. It is necessary that relevant departments pay more attention to people with poor health such as men, only-child, urban people, workers and farmers, and groups with high education degree during and after pandemic stabilization.","Pan, Yanbin; Yan, Jianlong; Lu, Wanxian; Shan, Miaohang",Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing,https://doi.org/10.4040/jkan.20241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33706327/,133

METHODS Our case series consisted of 13 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS Baseline pulmonary function tests were 55.7 ± 15.6 for FEV1%, 68.6 ± 16.0 for FVC%, and 1.2 ± 0.1 for FEV1/FVC%. Although pulmonary function showed a small improvement after 6 weeks, patients experienced a more significant improvement after 6 and 12 months in FEV1% (95.4 ± 13.7 and 107.2 ± 16.5, respectively; p < 0.001), FVC% (91.3 ± 14.5, and 105.9 ± 15.6, respectively; p < 0.001), and FEV1/FVC% values (1.04 ± 0.04, and 1.01 ± 0.05, respectively; p < 0.001).

Strong, Th1-skewed T cell responses can drive protective humoral and cell-mediated immune responses2 and might reduce the potential for disease enhancement3. Cytotoxic T cells clear virus-infected host cells and contribute to control of infection4. Studies of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have suggested a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in recovery from COVID-19 (refs. 5,6). ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) is a candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine comprising a replication-deficient simian adenovirus expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We recently reported preliminary safety and immunogenicity data from a phase 1/2 trial of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (NCT04400838)7 given as either a one- or two-dose regimen. The vaccine was tolerated, with induction of neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cells against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Here we describe, in detail, exploratory analyses of the immune responses in adults, aged 18-55 years, up to 8 weeks after vaccination with a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in this trial, demonstrating an induction of a Th1-biased response characterized by interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α cytokine secretion by CD4+ T cells and antibody production predominantly of IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. CD8+ T cells, of monofunctional, polyfunctional and cytotoxic phenotypes, were also induced. Taken together, these results suggest a favorable immune profile induced by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, supporting the progression of this vaccine candidate to ongoing phase 2/3 trials to assess vaccine efficacy.","Ewer, Katie J; Barrett, Jordan R; Belij-Rammerstorfer, Sandra; Sharpe, Hannah; Makinson, Rebecca; Morter, Richard; Flaxman, Amy; Wright, Daniel; Bellamy, Duncan; Bittaye, Mustapha; Dold, Christina; Provine, Nicholas M; Aboagye, Jeremy; Fowler, Jamie; Silk, Sarah E; Alderson, Jennifer; Aley, Parvinder K; Angus, Brian; Berrie, Eleanor; Bibi, Sagida; Cicconi, Paola; Clutterbuck, Elizabeth A; Chelysheva, Irina; Folegatti, Pedro M; Fuskova, Michelle; Green, Catherine M; Jenkin, Daniel; Kerridge, Simon; Lawrie, Alison; Minassian, Angela M; Moore, Maria; Mujadidi, Yama; Plested, Emma; Poulton, Ian; Ramasamy, Maheshi N; Robinson, Hannah; Song, Rinn; Snape, Matthew D; Tarrant, Richard; Voysey, Merryn; Watson, Marion E E; Douglas, Alexander D; Hill, Adrian V S; Gilbert, Sarah C; Pollard, Andrew J; Lambe, Teresa",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-01194-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33335323/,133

102903,Surgical complications of laparoendoscopic single-site donor nephrectomy: a retrospective study.,2017,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes symptoms in infected individuals ranging from mild flu symptoms via severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ventilation to death. Risk factors for severe courses are age, diabetes, hypertension and other serious diseases. The main entry portal for the virus into the body is probably the oral mucosa, as it is a known location of virus accumulation. The suspected main receptor is highly expressed in this tissue. Such a route of penetration of the virus into the body provides plausible explanations for severe COVID-19 courses seen particularly in older diabetes patients. The immune system of people with diabetes is considered to be generally impaired. Diabetes induces a chronic systemic inflammation, which regularly manifests as periodontitis. Furthermore, frequent hyperglycaemia is known to lead to additional weakening of the oral mucosa barrier. It is therefore recommended that preventive measures in diabetes patients should also include the bucchal area. Knowledge of the inflammatory status in the mouth and throat may be helpful for identification of patients at particular risk. An established biomarker for measuring the degree of orall inflammation is activated matrix metalloproteinase 8 (aMMP8), for which saliva tests are available. From our point of view, the current recommendations for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 associated COVID-19 disease should therefore be extended to include the aspects of measurement and sanitation of mouth and throat and regular disinfection of this area.","Pfützner, Andreas; Lazzara, Michael; Jantz, Julia",Journal of diabetes science and technology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1932296820930287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32506937/,133

A retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Korea with 300 HCWs who were at high risk of infection. Self-reported histories of vaccinations, infectious diseases, and contact with such cases were collected. Serological tests for immunoglobulin G titers of measles and varicella were performed. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis test, χ2 test, and Fisher exact test. Seropositivity rates were 96.3% for measles and 95.7% for varicella. Four different strategies (cases) for vaccination were investigated. Considering the progressive decline in antibody concentrations and the false-positive responses in self-reported histories, case 3, which involved administering 2-dose vaccinations to susceptible HCWs demonstrated by antibody screening tests for both measles and varicella, was the most cost-effective strategy.

104958,SARS-CoV-2 infection among inpatients with systemic lupus erythematosus in France: a nationwide epidemiological study.,2021-03-16,"CONTEXT Preventive medicine residents must train in population medicine (including analytics and population health) and clinical preventive medicine (including screening, behavioral counseling, and chemoprophylaxis). Yet, opportunities to perform both functions concurrently for the same population are scarce. Residents must also master the art of preventive medicine, but they often lack an established community of practice that provides a continuous forum to do so. This project explored Population Health Rounds as a novel vehicle to optimize preventive medicine residency training. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Modeled after traditional medical rounds, Population Health Rounds consist of a 1-hour weekly meeting engaging preventive medicine residents and supervising attendings at Stony Brook Medicine in both population medicine and clinical preventive medicine concurrently, including patient case discussions and targeted population health analytics. EVALUATION AND RESULTS Because of the pandemic, the rounds have predominantly focused on COVID-19 and its effects on the hospital employee population. In addition to providing direct patient care to COVID-19-positive and exposed employees, residents have analyzed data on this population and made recommendations to hospital leadership based on COVID-19's institutional epidemiology, including incidence, prevalence, and predictive factors. A formative qualitative survey of resident perceptions offers insights on the value and learning outcomes of this new model. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Factors that may impact the implementation, sustainability, and feasibility of this model are discussed.

105809,The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in the pathogenesis of COVID-19: the villain or the hero?,2020-06-27,"The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed communities. Physical, emotional, and financial struggles have heightened, especially with our vulnerable populations. People have been afraid to return to their provider's office. For children, there has been an interruption of well-visits and immunizations. As the nation saw a decline in immunization uptake, a pilot nurse-led program was designed to increase vaccinations and address the social determinant needs during a global pandemic. The purpose of this article is to describe the planning and implementation of a curbside immunization event. The Logic model was used as a framework to ensure an efficient and replicable process. Initial observations showed an overall increase in immunization uptake and 97% of participants current with recommended vaccinations. Most parents (93%) would attend again and recommend it to others. They also felt that infection control precautions helped make the care delivered safe and efficient. Social determinants of health were assessed and addressed. This method of vaccine delivery is a viable model going into the future. Others may replicate this model, and it may also serve as a platform regarding flu or COVID-19 vaccine distribution.","Murphy, Maureen; Serowoky, Mary L; Grant, Susan M",Nursing administration quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1097/naq.0000000000000471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34060505/,133

It is important in host defense against infection, as well as adaptive immune responses. While a wide array of cytokines are known to be involved in adverse remodeling of the heart and the progression to heart failure, the role of IFN-γ is unclear. Recent evidence from clinical studies, animal models of myocarditis and hypertension, as well as isolated cell studies, provide conflicting data as to whether IFN-γ is pathological or protective in the heart. Thus, it is important to highlight these discrepant findings so that areas of future investigation can be identified to more clearly determine the precise role of IFN-γ in the heart. Accordingly, this review will (1) discuss the source of IFN-γ in the diseased heart; (2) summarize the data from animal studies; (3) discuss the effects of IFN-γ on isolated cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes; (4) identify signaling mechanisms that may be invoked by IFN-γ in the heart; and (5) present the clinical evidence supporting a role for IFN-γ in heart failure.","Levick, Scott P; Goldspink, Paul H",Heart failure reviews,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10741-013-9393-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23589353/,133
106620,Laparoscopic repair of incisional hernia in solid organ-transplanted patients: the method of choice?,2014,"PURPOSE According to the lung cancer staging project, T1a (≤ 2 cm) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) should be additionally classified into ≤ 1 cm and > 1 to 2 cm groups. This study aimed to investigate the surgical procedure for NSCLC ≤ 1 cm and > 1 to 2 cm. METHODS We identified 15,760 patients with T1aN0M0 NSCLC after surgery from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Overall survival (OS) and lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS) were compared among patients after lobectomy, segmentectomy, or wedge resection. The proportional hazards model was applied to evaluate multiple prognostic factors. RESULTS OS and LCSS favored lobectomy compared with segmentectomy or wedge resection in patients with NSCLC ≤ 1 cm and > 1 to 2 cm. Multivariable analysis showed that segmentectomy and wedge resection were independently associated with poorer OS and LCSS than lobectomy for NSCLC ≤ 1 cm and > 1 to 2 cm. With sublobar resection, lower OS and LCSS emerged for NSCLC > 1 to 2 cm after wedge resection, whereas similar survivals were observed for NSCLC ≤ 1 cm. Multivariable analyses showed that wedge resection is an independent risk factor of survival for NSCLC > 1 to 2 cm but not for NSCLC ≤ 1 cm. CONCLUSION Lobectomy showed better survival than sublobar resection for patients with NSCLC ≤ 1 cm and > 1 to 2 cm. For patients in whom lobectomy is unsuitable, segmentectomy should be recommended for NSCLC > 1 to 2 cm, whereas surgeons could rely on surgical skills and the patient profile to decide between segmentectomy and wedge resection for NSCLC ≤ 1 cm.","Dai, Chenyang; Shen, Jianfei; Ren, Yijiu; Zhong, Shengyi; Zheng, Hui; He, Jiaxi; Xie, Dong; Fei, Ke; Liang, Wenhua; Jiang, Gening; Yang, Ping; Petersen, Rene Horsleben; Ng, Calvin S H; Liu, Chia-Chuan; Rocco, Gaetano; Brunelli, Alessandro; Shen, Yaxing; Chen, Chang; He, Jianxing",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2015.64.6729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27382092/,133

This meta-analysis assessed procedural outcomes of such interventions to elucidate the rate of early procedural failures and the need for such specialty devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for contemporary studies (2000-2012) reporting procedural or short-term outcomes for revascularization of infrapopliteal atherosclerotic lesions. A random-effects metaanalysis was performed, which included post hoc comparisons among treatment groups. RESULTS A total of 42 studies with 52 treatment arms representing 3,660 unique patients were included. Technical success rates were higher with bare metal stents (BMSs; 98.6%) than with atherectomy (92.2%; P < .05) or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA; 91.2%; P = .01), and higher with drug-eluting stents (DESs) than with PTA (P < .001). DES use had higher primary patency rates than atherectomy (P < .05), BMS use (P < .001), and PTA (P < .01). The 30-day rate of target lesion revascularization was significantly higher with PTA (8.1%) than with BMSs (2.2%; P < .05) and DESs (1.1%; P < .05). Thirty-day rates of major unplanned amputation (range, 1.5%-4.4%) and mortality (range, 0.9%-3.3%) were comparable among treatment groups. Significant heterogeneity among studies was noted for most PTA outcomes. Publication bias was evident for most PTA and DES outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Early failure of percutaneous therapies in patients with infrapopliteal atherosclerotic lesions is device- and technique-dependent. Specialty devices designed to reduce technical failure rates may therefore be of benefit in this selected group of patients. Study results are confounded by inconsistent data reporting, heterogeneity of treatment effects, and publication bias.","Razavi, Mahmood K; Mustapha, Jihad A; Miller, Larry E",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2014.06.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25130307/,133

STUDY DESIGN An experimental study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Ortadogu Hospital, Adana, Turkey, from 2013 to 2017. METHODOLOGY The inclusion criteria were patients with BMI > 40 Kg/m² or >35 Kg/m² (if there were comorbid diseases associated with obesity). The exclusion criteria were patients who were older than 65 years or had a bariatric procedure earlier. The patients were placed in three groups. Group 1 had no staple line reinforcement, group 2 had fibrin glue on the staple line, and group 3 had barbed continued suture on the staple line. The primary endpoints included stenosis, bleeding, and postoperative leaks. The secondary outcomes included total operation time and time for staple line reinforcement. Values of p<0.05 were deemed significant for all statistical tests. RESULTS The mean time to perform the staple line reinforcement was significantly higher in group 3 (22.05 ± 2.83 minutes) than in group 2 (fibrin glue, 10.86 ± 2.15 minutes, p<0.001). The mean total operation times were significantly different between all three groups; 70.8 ± 5.4 minutes for group 1, 74.7 ± 6.2 minutes for group 2, and 81.2 ± 3.0 minutes for group 3 (p<0.001).

CONCLUSION The use of fibrin glue and barbed continuous suture for staple line reinforcement during laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy had no effect on post- or per-operative hemorrhage and leakage; however, these procedures significantly extended the operation time.","Bayrak, Mehmet; Altintas, Yasemin",Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,https://doi.org/10.29271/jcpsp.2019.07.661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31253220/,133
113456,Catch me if you can: disappearing and reappearing posterior fossa dural arteriovenous malformation.,2019,"Genetic variations, in part, determine individual susceptibility to sepsis and pneumonia. Advances in genetic sequence analysis as well as high throughput platform analysis of gene expression has allowed for a better understanding of immunopathogenesis during sepsis. Differences in genes can also modulate immune and inflammatory response during sepsis thereby translating to differences in clinical outcomes. An increasing number of candidate genes have been implicated to play a role in sepsis susceptibility, most of which are controversial with few exceptions. This does not refute the significance of genetic polymorphisms in sepsis, but rather highlights the difficulties and pitfalls related to genetic association studies. These difficulties include differences in study design such as heterogeneous patient cohorts and differences in pathogenic organisms, linkage disequilibrium, and lack of power for detailed haplotype analysis or examination of gene-gene interactions. There is extensive diversity in the pathways of inflammation and immune response during sepsis making it even harder to prove the functional and clinical significance of one single genetic polymorphism which could be easily masqueraded or compensated by other upstream or downstream events of the pathway involved. The majority of studies have analysed candidate genes in isolation from other possible polymorphisms. It is likely that susceptibility to sepsis is the result of polymorphisms from multiple genes rather than one single mutation. Future studies should aim for multi-centered collaborative approach looking at genome wide association or gene profiling to provide a more complete appraisal of the key genetic players in determining genetic susceptibility to sepsis. This review paper will summarise the prominent candidate gene polymorphisms with known functional changes or those with haplotype data. In addition, a summary of the expanding research in the field of epigenetics and post-sepsis immunosuppression will be discussed.","Chung, Li Ping; Waterer, Grant W",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,https://doi.org/10.3109/10408363.2011.641517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22185617/,133

Consecutive PLHIV admitted with COVID-19 in 23 hospitals, between 16 April and 23 June 2020, were included. Data of a temporally matched-hospitalized general population were used to compare demography, comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms, and major outcomes. In total, 36 PLHIV subjects were enrolled; 92% were male and mean age was 44 years. Most patients (83%) were on antiretroviral therapy; mean CD4 count was 557 cells/mm3. Suppressed HIV viremia was found in 68% and 56% had, at least, one comorbidity. Severe COVID-19 occurred in 44.4%, intensive care was required in 22.2%, and five patients died (13.9%). No differences were seen between recovered and deceased patients in CD4 count, HIV viral load, or time since HIV diagnosis. Hypertension and cardiovascular disease were associated with a higher risk of death (p = 0.02 and 0.006, respectively). Compared with general population, the HIV cohort had significantly more men (OR 0.15; IC 95% 0.07-0.31) and younger age (OR 8.68; IC 95% 2.66-28.31). In PLHIV, we found more intensive care unit admission (OR 2.31; IC 95% 1.05-5.07) but no differences in the need for mechanical ventilation or death. In this cohort of PLHIV hospitalized with COVID-19, hypertension and cardiovascular comorbidities, but not current HIV viro-immunologic status, were the most important risk factors for mortality. No differences were found between PLHIV and general population in the need for mechanical ventilation and death.","Ceballos, Maria Elena; Ross, Patricio; Lasso, Martin; Dominguez, Isabel; Puente, Marcela; Valenzuela, Pablo; Enberg, Margarita; Serri, Michel; Muñoz, Rodrigo; Pinos, Yazmin; Silva, Macarena; Noguera, Matías; Dominguez, Angelica; Zamora, Francisco",International journal of STD & AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1177/0956462420973106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33533294/,133

Physiotherapists are one of the essential health professionals who are actively involved in promoting physical activities. The study objectives included assessing knowledge of physical activity guidelines, physiotherapist attitude towards involvement in physical activities and practice of routine physical activity assessment, and its promotion among physiotherapists in India during COVID-19. METHOD In this cross-sectional survey study, the study tool was prepared using Google Forms. It consisted of sixteen questions on knowledge, attitude, and practice of physical activities among physiotherapists. Study participants were physiotherapists with a minimum of a bachelor's degree qualification and practicing in India. RESULTS One hundred and eighty responses were received from sixteen states of India. The average age of respondents was 28 years, and the average work experience of five years. This study found that only 19% of physiotherapists could give the correct answer in all three domains of WHO PA guidelines. 70% of physiotherapists found with an appropriate attitude as they met the 150 min of moderate PA per week. 68% reported that they promote physical activities in routine practice. CONCLUSION This study suggested the majority of physiotherapists perform physical activity assessment and promotion in routine practice in India. Most of them have an appropriate attitude towards physical activity, but very few physiotherapists have adequate knowledge of WHO physical activity guidelines. Physiotherapists should actively promote physical activities in routine practice to reduce the impairment due to physical inactivity especially during the Corona virus disease pandemic in India. Efforts should be made to increase the physical activity awareness in terms of knowledge of WHO physical activity guidelines, different assessment, and promotion strategies.","Aditya Jadhav, Radhika; Gupta, Garima; Nataraj, Megha; Maiya, G Arun",Journal of bodywork and movement therapies,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbmt.2020.12.042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33992283/,133

With regard to patients with high blood pressure, the existence of an increased risk remains to be confirmed in large controlled trials. So far the findings regarding this question are reassuring, whether these patients are treated or not. There seems to be no reason to worry when using blockers of the renin-angiotensin system.

Whether we are selecting from a set of visualizations, commissioning someone to produce them, or creating them ourselves, an effective way of specifying intent can help guide this process. Ideally, we would have a concise and shared specification language. In previous work, we have argued that communicative intents can be viewed as a learning/assessment problem (i.e., what should the reader learn and what test should they do well on). Learning-based specification formats are linked (e.g., assessments are derived from objectives) but some may more effectively specify communicative intent. Through a large-scale experiment, we studied three specification types: learning objectives, insights, and assessments. Participants, guided by one of these specifications, rated their preferences for a set of visualization designs. Then, we evaluated the set of visualization designs to assess which specification led participants to prefer the most effective visualizations. We find that while all specification types have benefits over no-specification, each format has its own advantages. Our results show that learning objective-based specifications helped participants the most in visualization selection.

Nevertheless, Weber's understanding of everyday action is closely related to the various religious interpretations of what deprivations were suffered by humanity as a consequence of Adam's original sin and the paradisiacal yearning for salvation it engenders. Moreover, Weber's interpretation of the Fall is characteristic for his tragic sociology in the sense that it guarantees the freedom to subjectively create self-conscious meaning that is, however, no longer embedded in a context of common knowledge. His solution to this epistemological problem involves a Nietzschean heroic existentialism whereby individuals give personality to one's character by freely choosing their own values. Yet, he also realizes that many will not be able to choose by themselves and, therefore, will be attracted by charismatic leaders that can invoke a paradisiacal community of choice. Weber's modern antinomical interpretation of the Fall is still relevant today because it provides insight in the epistemological underpinnings of the contemporary populist Zeitgeist.","Thijssen, Peter",The British journal of sociology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-4446.12773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32614461/,133

However, the PARADISE-24 questionnaire is a comprehensive questionnaire for evaluating different psychological difficulties in cases with neurological disorders. Objective The aim of this study was to compare psychological difficulties in patients with migraine and those with epilepsy by using the PARADISE-24 questionnaire. Methods Overall, 240 migraineurs and 210 patients with epilepsy were enrolled. All the participants were asked to fill the Persian version of the PARADISE-24 questionnaire. Results In migraineurs, the mean age and mean headache severity (by means of visual analogue scale, VAS) were 38.6±11.6 and 6.8±2.8, respectively. In patients with epilepsy, the mean age and mean duration of the disease were 33.6±13.4 and 12±10.3 years, respectively. The mean PARADISE score was significantly higher in migraineurs than in epileptic cases (57.9±12 vs 50.7±15.1) (p<0.001).

122779,Laparoscopic transhiatal resection of a large mid-esophageal diverticulum: a case report.,2018,"PURPOSE In the U.S., TikTok surged in popularity as the COVID-19 virus spread nationally. TikTok posts may both reflect and shape young people's perceptions of the pandemic. This mixed methods study applied a uses and gratifications framework to a systematic analysis of trending TikToks related to COVID-19, with attention to changes over a 2-month period. METHODS Analyses are based on an original data set of 2,675 TikToks (529 unique videos across 68 COVID-relevant hashtags) viewed over 2,840,347,014 times. TikToks were tracked daily for 65 days after the beginning of U.S. stay-at-home orders (March 17 to May 20, 2020). A thematic analysis used 28 content codes and nine codes related to subject(s) to examine content patterns. Chi-square tests facilitated analyses of changes over time. RESULTS Trending TikToks related to COVID-19 most often featured details of everyday circumstances and/or relatable commentary on Pandemic Life. These posts were similarly prevalent in Months 1 and 2. Health-Promoting TikToks outnumbered those exhibiting Risky or Concerning Health Practices (58:13) and were more common in Month 1. Advertisements and sponsored campaigns also shaped trending COVID-relevant content during the study period. CONCLUSIONS On TikTok, public health information appears to coexist with an abundance of commentary about everyday life during the pandemic. Posts arguably reflect documented social media use goals such as information seeking/sharing, archiving, and self-expression. Yet, TikToks during the pandemic period perhaps most often connect to another previously undocumented use goal: a digital search for common humanity in seeing difficult experiences as part of a larger human experience.","Unni, Zoya; Weinstein, Emily",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.02.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33824071/,133

DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis. Multivariable linear regression models evaluated the association between diet quality and cost for all food, food at home, and food away from home. SETTING Daily food intake data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005-2016). Food prices were derived using data from multiple, publicly available databases. Diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index-2015 and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010. PARTICIPANTS 30,564 individuals ≥20 y with complete and reliable dietary data. RESULTS Mean per capita daily diet cost was $14.19 (95% CI: $13.91-14.48), including $6.92 ($6.73-7.10) for food consumed at home and $7.28 ($7.05-7.50) for food consumed away from home. Diet quality was higher for food at home compared to food away from home (P<0.001). Higher diet quality was associated with higher food costs overall, at home, and away from home (P<0.001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate that higher diet quality is associated with higher costs for all food, food consumed at home, and food consumed away from home. This research provides policymakers, public health professionals, and clinicians with information needed to support healthy eating habits. These findings are particularly relevant to contemporary health and economic concerns that have worsened because of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Conrad, Zach; Reinhardt, Sarah; Boehm, Rebecca; McDowell, Acree",Public health nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1368980021002810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34176554/,133

The recent United States Executive Order on Advancing American Kidney Health, in addition to focusing on ESKD prevention and reforming the kidney transplantation system, focuses on providing financial incentives to promote a shift toward home dialysis. In accordance with this order, a goal was set to have 80% of incident dialysis patients receiving home dialysis or a kidney transplant by 2025. Compared with conventional in-center therapy, home dialysis modalities, including both home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, appear to offer equivalent or improved mortality, clinical outcomes, hospitalization rates, and quality of life in patients with ESKD in addition to greater convenience, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. Treatment of anemia, a common complication of chronic kidney disease, may be easier to manage at home with a new class of agents, hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, which are orally administered in contrast to the current standard of care of i.v. iron and/or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. This review evaluates the clinical, quality-of-life, economic, and social aspects of dialysis modalities in patients with ESKD, including during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic; explores new therapeutics for the management of anemia in chronic kidney disease; and highlights how the proposed changes in Advancing American Kidney Health provide an opportunity to improve kidney health in the United States.","Rastogi, Anjay; Lerma, Edgar V",Kidney international supplements,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kisu.2020.12.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33777496/,133
126147,Persisting intrahospital transmission of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and challenges for infection control.,2019,"OBJECTIVE To determine whether high school start time is associated with headache frequency in adolescents with migraine. BACKGROUND Adolescence is marked by a physiologic delayed circadian phase, characterized by later bedtimes and wake times. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that high schools start no earlier than 8:30 a.m., but most high schools in the United States start earlier. The study hypothesis was that adolescents with migraine whose high schools start at 8:30 a.m. or later (late group) would have lower headache frequency than those whose schools start earlier than 8:30 a.m. (early group). METHODS This was a cross-sectional Internet survey study of US high schoolers with migraine recruited online through social media. Comparisons were made between the late group and the early group. The primary outcome measure was self-reported headache days/month. RESULTS In total, 1012 respondents constituted the analytic set: n = 503 in the late group versus n = 509 in the early group. Mean (SD) self-reported headache days/month was 4.8 (4.6) versus 7.7 (6.1) in the late and early groups, respectively (P < 0.001); mean difference -2.9 (95% CI -2.2 to -3.6). Mean (SD) self-reported hours of sleep on a school night was 7.9 (0.9) versus 6.9 (1.3), P < 0.001. Adjusting for total hours of sleep, sex, taking a migraine preventive, days of acute medication use, hours of homework, grade level, and missing breakfast, mean (SD) self-reported headache days/month remained lower in the late group than in the early group: 5.8 (95% CI 5.3-6.2) versus 7.1 (95% CI 6.7-7.4), (P < 0.001); mean difference -1.3 (95% CI -1.9 to -0.7). CONCLUSION Adolescents with migraine who attend high schools that follow AAP recommendations for start times have lower self-reported headache frequency than those whose high schools start before 8:30 a.m. If prospective studies confirm this finding, shifting to a later high school start time may be an effective strategy for migraine prevention in adolescents.","Gelfand, Amy A; Pavitt, Sara; Ross, Alexandra C; Szperka, Christina L; Irwin, Samantha L; Bertisch, Suzanne; Stone, Katie L; Frazier, Remi; Grimes, Barbara; Allen, I Elaine",Headache,https://doi.org/10.1111/head.14016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33237581/,133

MATERIALS AND METHODS Data of 476 patients visiting a specialized halitosis clinic in Leuven (Belgium) were reviewed retrospectively. Organoleptic (with the classic and with the negative-pressure method) and instrumental (with the Halimeter® and OralChroma™ ) ratings of breath odour were retrieved from patient files together with the final diagnosis. The correlations between the different methods were examined (Spearman correlation coefficient) as well as the positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity and specificity of all methods. RESULTS Both methods of OLS correlated similarly with the instrumental measurements (Halimeter® and OralChroma™ ). Analysis of PPV, NPV, sensitivity and specificity of both methods of examination showed that the negative-pressure method performed best. CONCLUSION The negative-pressure method is a valid method for organoleptic scoring of the breath odour and performs as good as the classic organoleptic method.","Laleman, Isabelle; De Geest, Sophie; Dekeyser, Christel; Teughels, Wim; Quirynen, Marc",Journal of clinical periodontology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpe.13012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30216545/,133

Despite their disrupted sources of livelihood, the majority of the African immigrants are without a social welfare safety net and have little hope of benefiting from the Government relief packages. Consequently, it seems that the increase in the triple burden of food insecurity, poverty and malnutrition compounded with social injustice and income inequality is inevitable for the urban poor African immigrants in South Africa. Even though the Government may not have the capacity to address food insecurity by itself, the Government should endeavour to make the limited resources to access food equally available to all with no social injustice. By working hand in hand with foreign national associations, township councillors and other stakeholders, such as the food banks and faith-based organisations, that have stepped forward to try and bridge the widening incapacity of the Government to feed the food insecure, the nexus of food insecurity and social injustice of African immigrants will be alleviated.","Odunitan-Wayas, Feyisayo A; Alaba, Olufunke A; Lambert, Estelle V",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1854325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275870/,133

METHODS An online survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1509 adults residing in Korea, from November 2 to 5, 2020. The degree of agreement with resource allocation principles in the context of the medical resource constraints precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic was examined. The results were then compared with ethicists' recommendations. We also examined whether the perceived severity of COVID-19 explained differences in individual preferences, and by doing so, whether perceived severity helps explain discrepancies between public preferences and ethicists' recommendations. RESULTS Overall, the public of Korea agreed strongly with the principles of ""save the most lives,"" ""Koreans first,"" and ""sickest first,"" but less with ""random selection,"" in contrast to the recommendations of ethicists. ""Save the most lives"" was given the highest priority by both the public and ethicists. Higher perceived severity of the pandemic was associated with a greater likelihood of agreeing with allocation principles based on utilitarianism, as well as those promoting and rewarding social usefulness, in line with the opinions of expert ethicists. CONCLUSIONS The general public of Korea preferred rationing scarce medical resources in the COVID-19 pandemic predominantly based on utilitarianism, identity and prioritarianism, rather than egalitarianism. Further research is needed to explore the reasons for discrepancies between public preferences and ethicists' recommendations.","Lee, Ji-Su; Kim, Soyun; Do, Young Kyung",Journal of preventive medicine and public health = Yebang Uihakhoe chi,https://doi.org/10.3961/jpmph.21.333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34649398/,133

Both the microcatheter and microwire are initially introduced into the distal vasculature, followed by withdrawal of the microwire to a point parallel to the distal exiting branch. The microcatheter and microwire are then gently withdrawn and a series of maneuvers to gradually reduce the loop is performed, obviating the need for distal purchase in the form of a stent, balloon, or coil, which have previously been described to maintain distal purchase.","Effendi, Khaled; Sacho, Raphael Hillel; Belzile, François; Marotta, Thomas R",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011604.rep; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25634903/,133

The Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) is a theoretically driven instrument developed for this purpose. The SCHFI measures self-care with three scales: self-care maintenance, measuring behaviors to maintain HF stability; symptom perception, measuring monitoring behaviors; and self-care management, assessing the response to symptoms. After the theory underpinning the SCHFI was updated, the instrument was updated to version 7.2 but it was only tested in the United States. In this study we tested the psychometric characteristics (structural and construct validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability) of the SCHFI v.7.2 in an Italian population of HF patients. We used a cross-sectional design to study 280 HF patients with additional data collected after 2 weeks for test-retest reliability. Adults with HF (mean age 75.6 (±10.8); 70.8% in New York Heart Association [NYHA] classes II and III) were enrolled from six centers across Italy. Confirmatory factor analysis showed supportive structural validity in the three SCHFI v.7.2 scales (CFI from 0.94 to 0.95; RMSEA from 0.05 to 0.07). Internal consistency reliability estimated with Cronbach's α and composite reliability ranged between .73 and .88; test-retest reliability ranged between 0.73 and 0.92. Construct validity was supported with significant correlations between the SCHFI v.7.2 scale scores and quality of life, brain natriuretic peptide levels and NYHA class. This study further supports the psychometric characteristics of the SCHFI v.7.2, illustrating that it can be used in clinical practice and research also in an Italian population.","Vellone, Ercole; De Maria, Maddalena; Iovino, Paolo; Barbaranelli, Claudio; Zeffiro, Valentina; Pucciarelli, Gianluca; Durante, Angela; Alvaro, Rosaria; Riegel, Barbara",Research in nursing & health,https://doi.org/10.1002/nur.22083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141495/,133

The high similarity of active sites among different serine proteases posts a challenge to reach high selectivity for inhibitors of serine proteases targeting at the active site. Here, we demonstrated that one particular surface loop on serine proteases (autolysis loop) can be used to regulate their catalytic activity, through surveying the recent works including ours, and such an approach can reach high specificity. The autolysis loop is highly variable among different serine proteases, explaining the high specificity of inhibitors targeting the autolysis loop. We also outline the structural origin that links the perturbation of the autolysis loop and the inhibition of protease activity. Thus, the autolysis loop appears to be a highly sensitive allosteric site and can be used as a general handle to develop pharmacological agents to intervene with the activities of serine proteases in, eg, blood coagulation.","Jiang, Longguang; Yuan, Cai; Huang, Mingdong",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202002139rr; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33417271/,133

First COVID-19 case was detected in March, 10, 2020 in Turkey and as of May, 18, 2020 148,067 cases have been identified and 4096 citizens have died. Tuberculosis (TB) is a worldwide public health concern, incidence of tuberculosis (per 100,000 people) in Turkey was reported at 14, 1 in 2018. During pandemic COVID-19 was the main concern in every clinic and as we discuss here overlapping respiratory diseases may result in delaying of the diagnosis and treatment. METHODOLOGY There were 4605 respiratory samples examined between March 23 and May 18 for COVID-19 and 185 samples for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in our laboratory. The Xpert Ultra assay was performed for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis; SARS-CoV-2 RNA was determined by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis in combined nasopharyngeal and deep oropharyngeal swabs of suspected cases of COVID-19. RESULTS Both of SARS-CoV-2 and M. tuberculosis tests were requested on the clinical and radiological grounds in 30 patients. Here we discussed 2 patients who were both COVID-19 and TB positive. One patient already diagnosed with tuberculosis become COVID-19 positive during hospitalization and another patient suspected and treated for COVID-19 received the final diagnosis of pulmonary TB and Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. CONCLUSIONS We want to emphasize that while considering COVID-19 primarily during these pandemic days, we should not forget one of the ""great imitators"", tuberculosis within differential diagnoses.","Can Sarınoğlu, Rabia; Sili, Uluhan; Eryuksel, Emel; Olgun Yildizeli, Sehnaz; Cimsit, Cagatay; Karahasan Yagci, Aysegul",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32794460/,133

Thirty (42.9%) were males, mean BMI was 25.5 ± 2.2 kg/m2. Average disease duration was 15.2 ± 7.1 years, and 20 (28.6%) subjects had developed PsA. Average hours of flight were 5.4 ± 3.5 (median 3.5 h), with 34 (48.6%) subjects reporting jet-lag. At the multivariate regression analysis, the change in the SAPASI score resulted correlated with jet-lag (regression coefficient 1.63, p = .0092), as well the change in the DLQI score (regression coefficient = 1.73, p = .0009), but no change on the pruritus VAS scale was found. Conclusions: The present study suggests that jet-lag may influence disease severity and DLQI scores, but not itch in psoriatic patients.","Damiani, G; Bragazzi, N L; Garbarino, S; Chattu, V K; Shapiro, C M; Pacifico, A; Malagoli, P; Pigatto, P D M; Conic, R R Z; Tiodorovic, D; Watad, A; Adawi, M",Chronobiology international,https://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2019.1678629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645138/,133

STUDY DESIGN This study included 121 patients who had undergone TVH or SP-TLH for uterine benign diseases between April 2011 and July 2012. Surgical outcomes, complications, and HRQOL were reviewed in the two groups. Preoperative and postoperative HRQOL data from the 36-item Short Form questionnaire (SF-36) were recorded for all patients. RESULTS TVH was performed more often for the patients who had fewer previous operations (p = 0.32). In the TVH, there were fewer combined surgical procedures (p < 0.01), shorter operation times (p < 0.01), shorter vaginal stump suture times (p = 0.03) and lower complication rates (p < 0.01) than in SP-TLH. Overall, all SF-36 scales improved after surgery, except for the Social Functioning scale. There was no significant difference in any of the scales between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS TVH has equivalent effects on HRQOL as SP-TLH. SP-TLH is preferred for the cases with complicated and combined procedures.","Kim, Ji Hyun; Lee, Yoon Hee; Chong, Gun Oh; Lee, Yoon Soon; Cho, Young Lae; Hong, Dae Gy",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.3109/13645706.2016.1141102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26902788/,133

The technique has been successfully applied for cholecystectomies and appendectomies. However, several doubts exist as to the technical limitations and feasibility of NOTES in other clinical settings. METHODS The authors have performed totally transvaginal colon resections in a sheep model. Although completion of the surgery was possible through the transvaginal route, the addition of a transumbilical laparoscope was used as an added safety measure. RESULTS Totally transvaginal resection of the sigmoid colon was performed for two sheep with no intra- or postoperative complications. CONCLUSION Totally transvaginal resection of the colon (pure NOTES) is feasible in a sheep model.","Alba Mesa, Francisco; Amaya Cortijo, Antonio; Romero Fernandez, Jose Manuel; Komorowski, Andrzej L; Sanchez Hurtado, Miguel Angel; Sanchez Margallo, Francisco Miguel",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1919-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21947741/,133

138481,"Reply to ""Nasal cromolyn in the treatment of rhinitis"".",2020-09-01,"Nitrogen (N) is a critical component of food security, economy and planetary health. Human production of reactive nitrogen (Nr) via Haber-Bosch process and cultivation-induced biological N2 fixation (BNF) has doubled global N cycling over the last century. The most important beneficial effect of Nr is augmenting global food supplies due to increased crop yields. However, increased circulation of Nr in the environment is responsible for serious human health effects such as methemoglobinemia (""blue baby syndrome"") and eutrophication of coastal and inland waters. Furthermore, ammonia (NH3) emission mainly from farming and animal husbandary impacts not only human health causing chronic lung disease, inflammation of human airways and irritation of eyes, sinuses and skin but is also involved in the formation of secondary particulate matter (PM) that plays a critical role in environment and human health. Nr also affects human health via global warming, depletion of stratospheric ozone layer resulting in greater intensity of ultra violet B rays (UVB) on the Earth's surface, and creation of ground-level ozone (through reaction of NO2 with O2). The consequential indirect human health effects of Nr include the spread of vector-borne pathogens, increased incidence of skin cancer, development of cataracts, and serious respiratory diseases, besides land degradation. Evidently, the strategies to reduce Nr and mitigate adverse environmental and human health impacts include plugging pathways of nitrogen transport and loss through runoff, leaching and emissions of NH3, nitrogen oxides (NO x ), and other N compounds; improving fertilizer N use efficiency; reducing regional disparity in access to N fertilizers; enhancing BNF to decrease dependence on chemical fertilizers; replacing animal-based proteins with plant-based proteins; adopting improved methods of livestock raising and manure management; reducing air pollution and secondary PM formation; and subjecting industrial and vehicular NO x emission to pollution control laws. Strategic implementation of all these presents a major challenge across the fields of agriculture, ecology and public health. Recent observations on the reduction of air pollution in the COVID-19 lockdown period in several world regions provide an insight into the achievability of long-term air quality improvement. In this review, we focus on complex relationships between Nr and human health, highlighting a wide range of beneficial and detrimental effects.","Nieder, Rolf; Benbi, Dinesh K",Reviews on environmental health,https://doi.org/10.1515/reveh-2021-0021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34022126/,133

Single port radical prostatectomy laparoendoscopic (LESS-RP) has established itself as a challenge for urological community, starting with the proposal of different approaches: extraperitoneal, transperitoneal and transvesical, initially described for laparoscopy and then laparoscopy robot-assisted. In order to improve the LESS-RP, new instruments, optical devices, trocars and retraction mechanisms have been developed. Advantages and disadvantages of LESS-RP are controversial, while some claim that it is a non-trustable approach, regarding the low cases number and technical difficulties, others acclaim that despite this facts some advantages have been shown and that previous described difficulties are being overcome, proving this is novel proposal of robotics platform, the Da Vinci SP, integrating the system into ""Y"". The LESS-RP approach gives us a new horizon and opens the door for rapid standardization of this technique. The few studies and short series available can be result of a low interest in the application of LESS-RP in prostate, probably because of the technical complexity that it requires. The new robotic platform, the da Vinci SP, shows that it is clear that the long awaited evolution of robotic technologies for laparoscopy has begun, and we must not lose this momentum.","Martín, Oscar Darío; Azhar, Raed A; Clavijo, Rafael; Gidelman, Camilo; Medina, Luis; Troche, Nelson Ramirez; Brunacci, Leonardo; Sotelo, René",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-016-0589-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27072150/,133

By testing and identifying a variety of respiratory pathogens, it was found that influenza viruses were the main pathogens in 172 ILI cases in 2019. The positive rates of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, influenza A (H3N2) virus and influenza B virus Victoria lineage were 30.81%, 14.53% and 30.55%, respectively. The positive detection of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus peaked in the first quarter. The positive rate of enterovirus/human rhinovirus was 6.40%, with a positive detection peak in the third quarter, while the positive rate of adenovirus was 4.65% with a positive detection peak in the second quarter of the year. Two human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43 positive samples, 1 HCoV-HKU1 positive sample and 1 HCoV-NL63 positive sample were detected, respectively, and no HCoV-229E positive sample was detected. The detection rate of Staphylococcus aureus was 17.44%, and the detection rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae was 9.88%. Influenza viruses were also the main pathogens in 1 447 SARI cases. The positive rates of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, influenza A (H3N2) virus and influenza B virus Victoria lineage were 5.46%, 1.73% and 0.30%, respectively. The positive detection of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus (17.50%) peaked in the first quarter. The total positive detection rate of enterovirus/human rhinovirus was 2.97%, the positive detection peaked in the first quarter. The positive rate of Mycoplasma pneumoniae was 3.25% and the positive rate of Legionella was 1.04%. 5 HCoV-229E positive samples, 10 HCoV-OC43 positive samples, 7 HCoV-HKU1 positive samples and 6 HCoV-NL63 positive samples were detected. Eight strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 4 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected after cultures. By implementing the active surveillance, we not only detected a case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in time, but also preliminary understood the pathogenic spectrum characteristics and seasonality of ILI and SARI in Shanghai. In recent years, the surveillance methods have been continuously improved and the number of sentinel hospitals has increased gradually. In particular, for the response to COVID-19, the Surveillance Information Reporting System of Acute Respiratory Infection based on HIS system has been promoted to cover the whole city, which might lay a foundation for the active surveillance and early warning of emerging infectious diseases in the future.","Chen, J; Zheng, Y X; Kong, D C; Wu, H Y; Yuan, Z A; Wu, F",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200421-00616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32539259/,133

We aimed at comparing work-matched high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on aerobic performance and muscular plasticity markers in healthy rats. Cognitive functions and brain plasticity markers were also investigated following the 8-week training. Rats performed the incremental exercise test and behavioural tests before and after training at day 1 (D1), D15, D29 and D57. Key cerebral markers were assessed by Western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to provide information on brain function related to angiogenesis, aerobic metabolism and neurotrophin activity at D59. Muscular protein levels involved in angiogenesis and aerobic metabolism were measured in both triceps brachii and soleus muscles. HIIT induced superior improvement of aerobic fitness compared to MICT, as indicated by enhancement of speed associated with lactate threshold (SLT) and maximal speed (Smax). In the triceps brachii muscle, markers of angiogenesis and aerobic activity were upregulated as well as myokines involved in neuroplasticity. Moreover, levels of key brain plasticity markers increased in the hippocampus after 8 weeks of HIIT, without improving cognitive functions. These findings might contribute to define physical exercise guidelines for maintaining brain health by highlighting the promising role of HIIT when using SLT for distinguishing low running speed from high running speed. Further studies are required to confirm these brain effects by exploring synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis mechanisms when exercise intensity is standardized and individualized.","Constans, Annabelle; Pin-Barre, Caroline; Molinari, Florence; Temprado, Jean-Jacques; Brioche, Thomas; Pellegrino, Christophe; Laurin, Jérôme",Behavioural brain research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2020.112977; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141075/,133

This study examined core emergency response competencies of Chinese nursing personnel related to the outbreak of major infectious diseases. METHODS A survey was conducted among 960 nurses working in a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China. Data were collected on core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel caring for patients with major infectious diseases, measuring overall competency as well as by dimensions of prevention ability, rescue ability, and preparation ability. A t-test and one-way analysis of variance were first analyzed for differences between groups, followed by multiple linear regression to analyze main influencing factors for core emergency response competencies. RESULTS The average score for core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel delivering care to patients with major infectious diseases was 128.05 (SD 22.23) (range 36-180 points); or 71%, which is equivalent to moderate performance. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that the main influencing factors for these nursing personnel were before participation in emergency drills for infectious diseases, current educational background, and working experience in the realm of infectious disease nursing. The final model explained 8.4% of the variance in core emergency response competencies. DISCUSSION These findings indicate that it is necessary to strengthen the training of nursing staff with educational background deficits or no prior work or drill experience related to infectious diseases to effectively improve the core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel relative to infectious diseases.","Song, Shu; Li, Xueyan; Bell, Sue Anne; Yang, Xingjing; Zhang, Weiying",Journal of emergency nursing,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jen.2021.04.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183192/,133

This trial evaluated pemetrexed with carboplatin (PCb) or cisplatin (PC) with concurrent RT followed by consolidation pemetrexed. METHODS In this open-label, noncomparative phase II trial, patients with inoperable stage IIIA/B non-small-cell lung cancer (initially all histologies, later restricted to nonsquamous) were randomized (1:1) to PCb or PC with concurrent RT (64-68 Gy over days 1-45). Consolidation pemetrexed monotherapy was administered every 21 days for three cycles. Primary endpoint was 2-year overall survival (OS) rate. RESULTS From June 2007 to November 2009, 98 patients were enrolled (PCb: 46; PC: 52). The 2-year OS rate was PCb: 45.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29.5-60.0%); PC: 58.4% (95% CI, 42.6-71.3%), and in nonsquamous patients was PCb: 48.0% (95% CI, 29.0-64.8%); PC: 55.8% (95% CI, 38.0-70.3%). Median time to disease progression was PCb: 8.8 months (95% CI, 6.0-12.6 months); PC: 13.1 months (95% CI, 8.3-not evaluable [NE]). Median OS (months) was PCb: 18.7 (95% CI, 12.9-NE); PC: 27.0 (95% CI, 23.2-NE). The objective response rates (ORRs) were PCb: 52.2%; PC: 46.2%. Grade 4 treatment-related toxicities (% PCb/% PC) were: anemia, 0/1.9; neutropenia, 6.5/3.8; thrombocytopenia, 4.3/1.9; and esophagitis, 0/1.9.

145633,Light-driven catalytic regulation of enzymes at the interface with plasmonic nanomaterials.,2020-07-09,"Gianotti-Crosti syndrome (GCS) is a self-limited condition, mainly affecting children younger than 6 years, less common in adolescents and adults. It consists of a viral exanthema with papular lesions with a flat top and symmetrical distribution, affecting predominantly extremities, gluteal region and extensor surfaces. It is often associated with viral infections but can also be related to bacterial infections, vaccination or be idiopathic. In this report, we present a case of GCS in a 13-year-old healthy female adolescent who presented with fever, odynophagia, prostration and diffuse maculopapular rash.

147029,ACR Appropriateness Criteria® acute respiratory illness in immunocompetent patients.,2011,"Introduction A large amount of recent research has focused on the nature of immunity elicited by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, particularly its robustness and the duration of protection it offers. As a vaccine's efficacy relies on its ability to induce a protective immune response, these questions remain particularly pertinent. An improved understanding of the immunity offered by the antibodies developed against SARS-CoV-2 in recovered patients is critical for the development of diagnostic tests and vaccines. Methods Our study aimed at the longitudinal analysis of antibody presence, persistence and its trend over eight months in a group of 30 COVID-19 recovered patients who tested positive by real-time quantitative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in the period 1-30 March 2020. The subjects were divided into two groups based on disease severity: mild (n=17 subjects) and moderately-severe (n=13 subjects). The MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV lgM/lgG chemiluminescent analytical system (CLIA) assay was used to analyze these antibody titres. Results IgG antibody persistency was demonstrated in 76.7 % of the subjects (23 out of 30) at eight months post-infection. For the moderately-severe group, the titre trends for both IgM and IgG changed in a statistically significant way throughout the time period with IgM below and IgG above the set cut-off. Conclusions The results of this study highlight an important point in terms of the association between humoral immune response and disease severity. Patients who have experienced a relatively severe infection might develop a stronger immune response that could persist for a longer period.","Dehgani-Mobaraki, P; Kamber Zaidi, A; Porreca, A; Floridi, A; Floridi, E; Monti, M; Dehgani-Mobaraki, M",Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita,https://doi.org/10.7416/ai.2021.2455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34113953/,133

RECENT FINDINGS There is a need to plan for resuming the normal elective stone surgery in the post-COVID era, keeping a clear record of all surgeries that is being deferred and identifying subgroups of surgical priorities, as for the de-escalation phase.Telehealth is very useful because it contributes to reduce virus dissemination guaranteeing at the same time an adequate response to patients' care needs. Once the pandemic is over, teleurology will continue to be utilized to offer cost-effective care to urological patients and it will be totally integrated in our clinical practice. SUMMARY This COVID-19 pandemic represents a real challenge for all national health providers: on the one hand, every effort should be made to assist COVID patients, while on the other hand we must remember that all other diseases have not disappeared in the meanwhile and they will urgently need to be treated as soon as the pandemic is more under control.A correct prioritization of cases when surgical activity will progressively return back to normality is of paramount importance.","Proietti, Silvia; Basulto-Martinez, Mario; Pavia, Maria Pia; Luciani, Lorenzo; Gaboardi, Franco; Giusti, Guido",Current opinion in urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0000000000000857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394610/,133

Signaling via TLR4 and its adaptor Toll-IL-1R domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-β (TRIF) has been implicated in reactive oxygen species-mediated acute lung injury and in Th2 immune responses. We investigated the contributions of oxidative stress and TLR4/TRIF signaling to experimental asthma induced by birch pollen exposure exclusively via the airways. Mice were exposed to native or heat-inactivated white birch pollen extract (BPEx) intratracheally and injected with the antioxidants, N-acetyl-L-cysteine or dimethylthiourea, prior to sensitization, challenge, or all allergen exposures, to assess the role of oxidative stress and pollen-intrinsic NADPH oxidase activity in allergic sensitization, inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Additionally, TLR4 signaling was antagonized concomitantly with allergen exposure, or the development of allergic airway disease was evaluated in TLR4 or TRIF knockout mice. N-acetyl-L-cysteine inhibited BPEx-induced eosinophilic airway inflammation and AHR except when given exclusively during sensitization, whereas dimethylthiourea was inhibitory even when administered with the sensitization alone. Heat inactivation of BPEx had no effect on the development of allergic airway disease. Oxidative stress-mediated AHR was also TLR4 and TRIF independent; however, TLR4 deficiency decreased, whereas TRIF deficiency increased BPEx-induced airway inflammation. In conclusion, oxidative stress plays a significant role in allergic sensitization to pollen via the airway mucosa, but the pollen-intrinsic NADPH oxidase activity and TLR4 or TRIF signaling are unnecessary for the induction of allergic airway disease and AHR. Pollen extract does, however, activate TLR4, thereby enhancing airway inflammation, which is restrained by the TRIF-dependent pathway.","Shalaby, Karim H; Allard-Coutu, Alexandra; O'Sullivan, Michael J; Nakada, Emily; Qureshi, Salman T; Day, Brian J; Martin, James G",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1103644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23776177/,133

The hypothesis was that mechanical enlargement of the root canal and Nd:YAG laser irradiation would yield more negative bacterial samples than conventional treatment. METHODS Forty-one patients (45 teeth) were allocated to the laser (n = 22) or control (n = 23) group. The teeth in the laser group were instrumented, irrigated with saline, and irradiated with Nd:YAG laser according to a standard protocol. The teeth in the control group were similarly instrumented but irrigated with 1% unbuffered sodium hypochlorite and 15% EDTA solution. Bacterial samples were taken before and after treatment, blinded, and immediately sent for culturing and analysis. RESULTS The initial bacterial samples were positive in 20 of 22 teeth in the laser group and 18 of 23 (P = .414) in the control group. After the initial treatment, negative bacterial samples were found in 11 teeth in the laser group and 13 (P = .768) in the control group. After 2 to 4 days with no antibacterial dressing in the root canals, 5 teeth in the laser group and 9 (P = .337) in the control group yielded negative bacterial samples. CONCLUSIONS After intervention, neither the test group nor the control group yielded predictable negative bacterial samples. Thus, the results failed to verify the hypothesis that Nd:YAG laser irradiation would yield significantly more negative bacterial samples than conventional irrigation with 1% unbuffered sodium hypochlorite solution.","Granevik Lindström, Maria; Wolf, Eva; Fransson, Helena",Journal of endodontics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joen.2017.01.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28389075/,133
152239,"Hospital-acquired Clostridioides difficile infection among patients at an urban safety-net hospital in Philadelphia: Demographics, neighborhood deprivation, and the transferability of national statistics.",2020-12-07,"Background The integration of NIR photothermal therapy and chemotherapy is considered as a promising technique for future cancer therapy. Hollow Prussian nanospheres have attracted much attention due to excellent near-infrared photothermal conversion effect and drug-loading capability within an empty cavity. However, to date, the hollow Prussian nanospheres have been prepared by a complex procedure or in organic media, and their shell thickness and size cannot be controlled. Thus, a simple and controllable route is highly desirable to synthesize hollow Prussian nanospheres with controllable parameters. Materials and Methods Here, in our designed synthesis route, the traditional FeCl3 precursor was replaced with Fe2O3 nanospheres, and then the Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles were engineered into hollow-structured PB (HPB) nanospheres through an interface reaction, where the Fe2O3 colloidal template provides Fe3+ ions. The reaction mechanism and control factors of HPB nanospheres were systematically investigated. Both in vitro and in vivo biological effects of the as-synthesized HPB nanospheres were evaluated in detail. Results Through systematical experiments, a solvent-mediated interface reaction mechanism was put forward, and the parameters of HPB nanospheres could be easily adjusted by growth time and template size under optimal water and ethanol ratio. The in vitro tests show the rapid and remarkable photothermal effects of the as-prepared HPB nanospheres under NIR laser irradiation (808 nm). Meanwhile, HPB nanospheres also demonstrated a high DOX loading capacity of 440 mg g-1 as a drug carrier, and the release of the drug can be regulated by the heat from PB shell under the exposure of an NIR laser. The in vivo experiments confirmed the outstanding performance of HPB nanospheres in photothermal/chemo-synergistic therapy of cancer. Conclusion A solvent-mediated template route was developed to synthesize hollow Prussian blue (HPB) nanospheres in a simple and controllable way. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate the as-synthesized HPB nanospheres as a promising candidate due to their low toxicity and high efficiency for cancer therapy.","Lu, Long; Zhang, Chuanbin; Zou, Bingfang; Wang, Yongqiang",International journal of nanomedicine,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s252505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764943/,133

This type of tumor is difficult to identify and can easily be misdiagnosed. The International PPB protocol is a complicated and aggressive protocol. It is not easily applicable to developing countries where hospitals do not have enough resources. Here we present a challanging case of a patient successfully treated in Vietnam, using limited medical resources. The patient (22 month old, male) was diagnosed with congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation in his 1st hospital admission. After 6 months of onset, the patient was diagnosed with PPB type II in the fourth hospitalization following analysis of a lung CT scan and a pathology report. After the aggressive chemotherapy regimen, the patient had two episodes of severe neutropenia and infection from which he recovered. The patient received chemotherapy and surgery treatment at our hospital, but received radiation under general anesthesia and rehabilitation therapy to improve respiration at another hospital over 600 km away. It has been 1.5 years after entering remission, and he is starting kindergarten. Lung CT scan and pathology should be analyzed to avoid missing diagnosis of PPB in patients with cystic or mixed cystic and solid lung lesions. Biopsies from cases of suspected PPB should be sent for expert pathology review. Two factors important to the successful application of the protocol are good supportive care and the multidisciplinary collaboration between medical facilities to provide proper resources during treatment. We hope to recreate more successful outcomes not only in Vietnam but also in all developing countries.","Lan, Bui Ngoc; Ngoc, Le Thi Kim; Thach, Hoang Ngoc; Duy, Phan Canh",Pediatric hematology and oncology,https://doi.org/10.1080/08880018.2020.1818905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985315/,133

Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging viral infection without any approved treatment. Investigational therapies for COVID-19 may cause clinically important drug-drug interactions (DDIs). We aimed to study drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and their risk factors in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in a tertiary care hospital dedicated to COVID-19 patients. The Lexi-Interact database was used to investigate clinically important DDIs. The database output, including interacting drug pairs, risk rating, reliability rating, mechanism, and management, was evaluated. Results: Medical records of 200 COVID-19 patients were analysed. All patients had at least one clinically important DDI. More than half of interactions were associated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, the most commonly prescribed medications for the management of COVID-19. Concomitant drugs for comorbid conditions leading to polypharmacy were significantly associated with the occurrence of this. Conclusion: There is a higher chance of DDI, which necessitates ongoing care evaluation and therapy adjustment.

159872,Incarcerated femoral hernia treated with elective totally extraperitoneal repair: a case report.,2020-06-01,"INTRODUCTION Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is recommended as first-line therapy in respiratory failure of critically ill immunocompromised patients as it can decrease intubation and mortality rates as compared with standard oxygen. However, its recommendation is only conditional. Indeed, the use of NIV in this setting has been challenged recently based on results of trials finding similar outcomes with or without NIV or even deleterious effects of NIV. To date, NIV has been compared with standard oxygen but not to high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFOT) in immunocompromised patients. Several studies have found lower mortality rates using HFOT alone than when using HFOT with NIV sessions in patients with de novo respiratory failure, and even in immunocompromised patients. We are hypothesising that HFOT alone is more effective than HFOT with NIV sessions and reduces mortality of immunocompromised patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This study is an investigator-initiated, multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing HFOT alone or with NIV in immunocompromised patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) for severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Around 280 patients will be randomised with a 1:1 ratio in two groups. The primary outcome is the mortality rate at day 28 after inclusion. Secondary outcomes include the rate of intubation in each group, length of ICU and hospital stay and mortality up to day 180.

161909,Antifungal prophylaxis in lung transplant recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2020-05-25,"The influenza A virus contains a proton-selective ion channel (M2) that is the target of the adamantane family of drug inhibitors. Two recently published studies relating to adamantane binding of the M2 ion channel using X-ray crystallography and solution NMR have reignited interest in the potential use of adamantanes in combating the spread of influenza A. However, these two studies propose different binding sites for the adamantane drugs with the X-ray M2/amantadine structure favoring an ion channel pore-binding model and the solution NMR M2/rimantadine structure suggesting the existence of a lipid-facing binding pocket. We conducted a series of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments designed to accurately measure the affinity of amantadine and rimantadine to M2 ion channels embedded in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine (DMPC) liposomes. We find that this class of drug is capable of binding M2 with two different affinities in the order of 10(-4) and 10(-7) M, suggesting that both proposed binding sites are feasible. Furthermore, by examining drug binding to M2 mutant constructs (V27A, S31N, and D44A), it was possible to probe the location of the two binding sites. We show that a high-affinity binding site corresponds to the M2 ion channel pore whereas the secondary, low-affinity binding site can be attributed to the lipid face of the pore. These SPR results are in excellent agreement with the most recent solid-state NMR study of amantadine-bound M2 in lipid bilayers and provide independent support that the ion channel pore-binding site is responsible for the pharmacological activity elicited by the adamantane drugs.","Rosenberg, Matthew R; Casarotto, Marco G",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1002051107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20643947/,133

Despite the significance, fracture mechanics of blood clots remains largely unexplored, particularly the measurements of toughness and critical length scales governing clot fracture. Here, we study the fracture behavior of human whole blood clots and platelet-poor plasma clots. The fracture energy of whole blood clots and platelet-poor plasma clots determined using modified lap-shear method is 5.90±1.18 J/m2 and 0.96±0.90 J/m2, respectively. We find that the measured toughness is independent of the specimen geometry and loading conditions. These results reveal a significant contribution of blood cells to the clot fracture, as well as the dissipative length scale and nonlinear elastic length scale governing clot fracture.","Liu, Shiyu; Bao, Guangyu; Ma, Zhenwei; Kastrup, Christian J.; Li, Jianyu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.13.435277,133

Due to its high transmissibility, its prevalence in the U.S.A. grew from a near-zero baseline in early May 2021 to nearly 100% by late August 2021, according to CDC tracking. We accessed openly available data sources from the public health authorities of seven U.S. states, five U.S. counties, and the District of Columbia on RT-PCR COVID-19 tests split by the COVID-19 vaccination status of individuals tested during this period. Together, these time series enable estimation and tracking of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE*) (against RT-PCR diagnosed infection) concurrently with the growth of Delta variant prevalence in those locations. Our analyses reveal that in each locality the VE* for the combined set of all three US vaccines remained relatively stable and quite well-performing, despite the dramatic concurrent rise of Delta variant prevalence. We conclude that the Delta variant does not significantly evade vaccine-induced immunity. The variations in our measured VE* appear to be driven by demographic factors affecting the composition of the vaccinated cohorts, particularly as pertains to age distribution. We report that the measured VE*, aggregated across the collected sites, began at a value of about 0.9 in mid-May, declined to about 0.76 by mid-July, and recovered to about 0.9 by mid-September.","Blaiszik, B.; Graziani, C.; Olds, J.

The studies are actively developing and require long-term data analysis to determine possible long-term complications, persistent changes in physiological parameters and anatomical and histological structures, as well as to establish the possibility of regression of these changes and complications. The results obtained will undoubtedly improve not only the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of coronavirus infection and its complications, but also make it possible to predict certain disease's outcomes and changes in the function of organs and systems. In turn, this will give an understanding of the measures that need to be taken to completely avoid or minimize these complications and changes.

Here, we assessed the impact of airway epithelial cellular composition on infection in air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of differentiated primary human tracheal (PTEC) and bronchial epithelial cells (PBEC). We first compared SARS-CoV-2 infection kinetics, related antiviral and inflammatory responses, and viral entry factors in PTEC and PBEC. Next, the contribution of differentiation time was investigated by differentiating ALI-PTEC/PBEC for 3-5 weeks and comparing dynamics of viral replication/spread, cellular composition and epithelial responses. We observed a gradual increase in viral load with prolonged culture duration. Ciliated and goblet cells were predominantly infected in both PTEC and PBEC. Immunofluorescence analysis and RT-qPCR showed that compared to other cell types mainly ciliated and goblet cell numbers were affected by increased culture duration. An increased proportion of these two target cell types was associated with increased viral load. Furthermore, modulation of cellular composition using IL-13 and the Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT, underlined the importance of both ciliated and goblet cells for infection. DAPT treatment resulted in a lower viral load and a relative increase in ciliated cells at the expense of goblet cells, compared to IL-13 treated cultures in which both cell types were present and viral load was higher. In conclusion, our results identify cellular composition as a contributing factor to airway epithelial susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE In this study, we determined an effect of culture duration and airway cellular composition of ALI-PBEC and ALI-PTEC cultures on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was increased with prolonged cell culture time and the total percentage and proportion of ciliated and goblet cells played an important role in infection level, suggesting that airway epithelial differentiation/maturation levels may in part determine susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The development of effective therapies either targeting virus replication or pathogenesis against SARS-CoV-2 requires robust cell culture-based infection models to test small molecules and biologicals. Therefore, it is important to identify factors that are essential for reliably modeling SARS-CoV-2-airway epithelial cell interactions. This study sheds light on virus-airway epithelial cell interactions and adds to the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 cell tropism in the airways. In addition, the effect of IL-13 on viral infection hints at a causal connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and (allergic) asthma.","Wang, Ying; Thaler, Melissa; Ninaber, Dennis K.; van der Does, Anne M.; Ogando, Natacha S.; Beckert, Hendrik; Taube, Christian; Salgado-Benvindo, Clarisse; Snijder, Eric J.; Bredenbeek, Peter J.; Hiemstra, Pieter S.; van Hemert, Martijn J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.21.453304,133

The programme sought to fill a gap caused by the temporary closure of face-to-face UK hospice-based day therapy programmes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants’ comments on this arts-based programme illustrated the sense of disrupted and diminished identity, linked to a deceased sense of agency, which terminal illness can bring. Responding to this need for increased agency led to the development of the PATCH (Palliative care patient-led change) programme. Individuals with a terminal illness will be invited to join an online collaborative group, to identify a specific issue they wish to address and to lead the change they wish to see. The PATCH group will be supported by a facilitator and a team of volunteers, whose roles will include supporting participants in planning and executing their change strategy. This article presents the conceptual underpinning for the PATCH programme, offering a tentative theory of the relationship between identity, moral purpose, agency, illness and the leadership of change for those living with a life-limiting illness.

This paper studies the online modest fashion small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Egypt as a Muslim country. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on the social cognitive theory (SCT) and the literature to develop a theoretical framework of the factors influencing customers’ value co-creation intention on social media. The framework is then tested quantitatively through structural equation modelling based on partial least squares method (SEM-PLS) approach using the SmartPLS software. Findings: The empirical analysis supported the SCT through the following conclusions: first, regarding the subject factors, self-efficacy has a positive significant effect on all dimensions of customer engagement and outcome expectation has a positive significant effect on cognitive customer engagement. Concerning the environmental factors, community experience has a positive significant effect on affective and behavioural customer engagement, whereas content quality has a positive significant effect on affective customer engagement. Second, customer engagement is a significant mediator through the dimensions of affective and behavioural customer engagement. Practical implications: The findings of this study can help online modest fashion SMEs better comprehend the factors which influence the customers’ engagement for value co-creation intention whether it is subject factors or environmental factors. Therefore, they can better operate online and encourage customers to contribute to the development of new products and services and hence achieve a competitive advantage and survive in times of COVID-19. Originality/value: Most of the existing studies focused on the value co-creation behaviour and output. However, there is limited research focusing on what contributes to the customers’ engagement for value co-creation intention, especially for online modest fashion and Muslim countries.

This highly conserved enzyme cleaves the C-terminal basic residues of the peptide precursors to generate their bioactive form. CPE is a secreted protein; however, the Intracellular pathways leading to its secretion are still obscure. We combined live-cell microscopy and molecular analysis to examine the intracellular distribution and secretion dynamics of fluorescently tagged CPE. CPE was found to be a soluble luminal protein as it traffics from the ER via the Golgi apparatus to lysosomes. Moreover, CPE is efficiently secreted and reinternalized to lysosomes of neighboring cells. The C-terminal amphipathic helix of CPE is essential for its efficient targeting to, and secretion from lysosomes. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer demonstrated that CPE and its substrate neuropeptide Y (NPY) interact in the Golgi apparatus and Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that both CPE and NPY are co-secreted.

Although no clear evidence is available that NPWT accelerates wound healing compared to other interventions or that one form of NPWT is better than another, preclinical research suggests that the most commonly used dressings, level of negative pressure, and application mode (continuous, intermittent, or variable) may not be optimal for all patients. To summarize available literature related to these NPWT choices, pertinent literature published between 2005 and 2010 was reviewed. Preclinical study results suggest that the maximal biological effect of NPWT at the wound edge often can be achieved at -80 mm Hg and that foam dressings may be advantageous for large defect wounds, whereas gauze dressings may be more suitable for smaller wounds or when scar formation or pain is a concern. Preclinical research results also suggest that intermittent or variable pressure application has a better effect on granulation tissue formation than continuous application. The variable pressure mode maintains a negative pressure environment at lower pressure settings without dramatic fluctuations inherent to intermittent (on-and-off) pressure. Prospective, controlled clinical studies are needed to compare NPWT to other advanced wound care protocols of care and to ascertain the effect of various NPWT methods and regimens on outcomes of care.","Borgquist, Ola; Ingemansson, Richard; Malmsjö, Malin",Ostomy/wound management,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21512192/,133

Genetically the three variant IBV strains, designated CA557/03, CA706/03, and CA1737/04, were not related to each other. GenBank BLAST database search and phylogenetic analysis of the hypervariable region of the S1 subunit of the spike gene to determine the most closely related viruses to the three variants showed the CA557/03 variant to be 81.8% similar to the CAV/CA56b/91 whereas the CA706/03 and CA1737/04 variant viruses were only distantly related to Dutch/D1466/81 (72.2%), a vaccine strain used in Europe, and Korea/K142/02 (72.7%), a Korean field isolate, respectively. Cross virus-neutralization testing showed that none of the 2003-04 California IBV variant viruses were serologically related to each other or to Ark, Conn, or Mass vaccine strains. In addition the CA1737/04 isolate was also tested against DE072 and found not to be serologically related. All three variant viruses were pathogenic in 1-wk-old broilers and vaccination with Mass/Conn followed by Holland/Conn provided 80% protection against the CA1737/04 virus. The 2003-04 California variant viruses were not compared with variants isolated in California during 1970s and 1980s because, to our knowledge, no genetic information is available and those viruses are no longer obtainable. This study shows that the CA557/03 virus was distantly related to the CAV-type viruses isolated in California in the early 1990s, but that none of the 2003-04 viruses were similar genetically or serologically to the CAL99-type viruses, indicating that new IBV variants continue to emerge and cause disease in commercial chickens in California.","Jackwood, Mark W; Hilt, Deborah A; Williams, Susan M; Woolcock, Peter; Cardona, Carol; O'Connor, Robert",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17626478/,133

METHODS The length and curvature changes of 6 femoropopliteal segments (the right and left superficial femoral and popliteal arteries) from 3 cadavers were measured in 3-dimensional space based on rotational angiography image data in straight leg and flexed hip/knee (50°/90°) positions before and after placement of nitinol stents of varying type (EverFlex, Misago, and BioMimics 3D) and length (60, 100, and 200 mm) in different locations along the arteries. Three-dimensional centerline data were extracted for the measurements. RESULTS All 6 femoropopliteal cadaver segments displayed signs of peripheral artery disease. Hip/knee flexion resulted in vessel shortening and increases in the mean and maximum vessel curvatures in all cases. Location-specific results of the unstented arteries showed that magnitudes of vessel length and curvature change vary as a function of vessel length. The average shortening of the entire femoropopliteal segment due to flexion was observed at 10.7%±0.7%, which was reduced to 8.1%±0.9% after stent deployment. Average and maximum curvatures of the unstented segment increased due to flexion (average: 0.008±0.002 mm-1 to 0.019±0.006 mm-1, maximum: 0.030±0.009 mm-1 to 0.091±0.045 mm-1). After stent deployment, average and maximum curvatures of the flexed stented segments increased compared with the flexed unstented segments (average: 0.019±0.006 mm-1 to 0.022±0.004 mm-1, maximum: 0.091±0.045 mm-1 to 0.103±0.025 mm-1). The most flexurally stiff stent demonstrated the least ability to axially shorten during flexion of the leg at the knee joint. CONCLUSION The deformation characteristics of the femoropopliteal segment change in the presence of a stent, with the change to the deformation behavior dependent on stent type, stent length, location, flexibility, and intrinsic centerline curvature.","Ní Ghriallais, Ríona; Heraty, Kevin; Smouse, Bob; Burke, Martin; Gilson, Paul; Bruzzi, Mark",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27647689/,133

In vitro transcription/translation of both the wild-type and a 5' truncated clone lacking the first ATG codon yielded a peptide that comigrates on electrophoresis with a polypeptide immunoprecipitated from BDV-infected cells. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a putative signal for nuclear targeting.","Thierer, J; Riehle, H; Grebenstein, O; Binz, T; Herzog, S; Thiedemann, N; Stitz, L; Rott, R; Lottspeich, F; Niemann, H",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1538196/,133

Comparison of the latter two has previously revealed an extra open reading frame (ORF) at the 3' end of the FIPV genome, lacking in TGEV, now designated ORF 6b. Both CCV and FECV possess 6b-related ORFs. The CCV ORF 6b is colinear with that of FIPV, but the predicted amino acid sequences are only 58% identical. The FECV ORF 6b contains a large deletion compared to that of FIPV, reducing the colinear part to 60%. The sequence homologies were highest between CCV and TGEV on the one hand and between FECV and FIPV on the other. The expression product of the CCV and the FECV ORF 6b can be detected in infected cells by immunoprecipitation.","Vennema, H; Rossen, J W; Wesseling, J; Horzinek, M C; Rottier, P J",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8209715/,133

However, the safety and efficacy of extending the window for intervention remains to be definitively established. CASE REPORT A healthy 26-year-old woman presented with headache, left-sided hemiplegia, and rightward gaze palsy 2 days after a minor trauma. Time last known well was approximately 50 hours prior to presentation. Computed tomography angiography revealed dissection of the distal right internal carotid artery and occlusion of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a small area of acute infarct in the right basal ganglia and right insular cortex, but suggested a large ischemic penumbra; this was confirmed with cerebral perfusion analysis. In light of the patient's young age and potential for penumbral salvage, mechanical thrombectomy of an M1 thrombus and stenting of an internal carotid artery dissection were performed nearly 60 hours after the onset of symptoms. The patient demonstrated marked clinical improvement over the following days and was discharged home in excellent condition one week after presentation. Based on our clinical experience and other emerging data, we propose that extension of the 24-hour window for endovascular intervention may improve functional outcomes among select individuals. CONCLUSIONS A 24-hour window for endovascular thrombectomy is appropriate for many patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke. However, in select individuals, extension of the window to 48 hours or beyond may improve functional outcomes.","Beutler, Bryce D; Rangaswamy, Rajesh; King, Richard D; Tabaac, Burton J",Am J Case Rep,,133

Prior to the pandemic, the uptake of digital health technologies to directly strengthen public health systems had been unsatisfactory; however, a relentless acceleration took place within health care systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, digital health technologies could not be prescinded from the organizational and institutional merits of the systems in which they were introduced. The Italian National Health Service is strongly decentralized, with the national government exercising general stewardship and regions responsible for the delivery of health care services. Together with the substantial lack of digital efforts previously, these institutional characteristics resulted in delays in the uptake of appropriate solutions, territorial differences, and issues in engaging the appropriate health care professionals during the pandemic. An in-depth analysis of the organizational context is instrumental in fully interpreting the contribution of digital health during the pandemic and providing the foundation for the digital reconstruction of what is to come after.","Petracca, Francesco; Ciani, Oriana; Cucciniello, Maria; Tarricone, Rosanna",J Med Internet Res,,133

DESIGN: We first merge various risk factors from federal agencies (e.g. Census Bureau and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) with COVID-19 cases as of June 13th in contiguous US counties (N = 3,042). We then apply negative binomial regression to the county-level dataset to test three interrelated research hypotheses and the moderating role of residential segregation is presented with a figure. RESULTS: Several key results are obtained. (1) Counties with high racial/ethnic density of minority groups experience more confirmed cases than those with low levels of density. (2) High levels of residential segregation between whites and non-whites increase the number of COVID-19 infections in a county, net of other risk factors. (3) The relationship between racial/ethnic density and COVID-19 infections is enhanced with the increase in residential segregation between whites and non-whites in a county. CONCLUSIONS: The pre-existing social structure like residential segregation may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 and aggravate racial/ethnic health disparities in infections. Minorities are disproportionately affected by the novel coronavirus and focusing on pre-existing social structures and discrimination in housing market may narrow the uneven burden across racial/ethnic groups.","Yang, Tse-Chuan; Emily Choi, Seung-Won; Sun, Feinuo",Ethn Health,,133

The aim of this study was to assess the HRQL in patients with mCRPC receiving docetaxel or cabazitaxel. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PROSELICA (NCT01308580) assessed the non-inferiority of cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2 (C20) versus 25 mg/m2 (C25) in patients with mCRPC after docetaxel. FIRSTANA (NCT01308567) assessed the superiority of C25 or C20 versus docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (D75) in patients with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC. HRQL and pain were analyzed using protocol-defined, prospectively collected, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) and McGill-Melzack questionnaires. Analyses included definitive improvements in HRQL, maintained or improved HRQL, and HRQL over time. RESULTS: In total, 2131 patients were evaluable for HRQL across the two studies. In PROSELICA, 38.8% and 40.5% of patients receiving C20 and C25, respectively, had definitive FACT-P total score (TS) improvements.

However, although these applications can have actionable effects on public health efforts to control pandemics, the participatory or voluntary nature of these measures is obscuring the relationship between health information and traditional government surveillance techniques, potentially preventing effective oversight. Public health measures have traditionally been resistant to the integration of government-led intelligence techniques, such as signals intelligence (SIGINT), because of ethical and legal issues arising from the nature of surveillance techniques.We explore this rise of participatory SIGINT and its nature as an extension of biosurveillance through 3 drivers: the rise of surveillance capitalism, the exploitation of a public health crisis to obscure state of exception politics with a moral imperative, and the historically enduring nature of emergency-implemented surveillance measures.We conclude that although mobile applications may indeed be useful in containing pandemics, they should be subject to similar oversight and regulation as other government intelligence collection techniques.","Bernard, Rose; Bowsher, Gemma; Sullivan, Richard",Am J Public Health,,133

The present study aimed to examine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) co-infection with influenza A virus (IAV) in an attempt to provide clues for the antiviral interventions of co-infected patients. We described two patients who were co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and IAV treated at Wuhan Union Hospital, China. In addition, we performed a review in PubMed, Web of Science and CNKI (from January 1 up to November 1, 2020) with combinations of the following key words: ""COVID-19, SARS-COV-2, influenza A and co-infection"". A total of 28 co-infected patients were enrolled in the analysis. Of the 28 patients, the median age was 54.5 years (IQR, 34.25-67.5) and 14 cases (50.0%) were classified as severe types. The most common symptoms were fever (85.71%), cough (82.14%) and dyspnea (60.71%). Sixteen patients had lymphocytopenia on admission and 23 patients exhibited abnormal radiological changes. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 4 days (IQR, 3-6), and the median time of hospital stay was 14 days (IQR, 8.5-16.75). In conclusion, patients with SARS-COV-2 and IAV co-infection were similar to those infected with SARS-COV-2 alone in symptoms and radiological images. SARS-COV-2 co-infection with IAV could lead to more severe clinical condition but did not experience longer hospital stay compared with patients infected with SARS-COV-2 alone.","Xiang, Xuan; Wang, Zi-Hao; Ye, Lin-Lin; He, Xin-Liang; Wei, Xiao-Shan; Ma, Yan-Ling; Li, Hui; Chen, Long; Wang, Xiao-Rong; Zhou, Qiong",Curr Med Sci,,133

This study aimed to assess lifestyle changes affecting weight, sleep, mental health, physical activity, and dietary habits prospectively from before COVID-19 to during lockdown. METHODS: A total of 297 Saudi women, aged 19-30 years (mean age, 20.7 ± 1.4 years), were interviewed at two time points, before and during the quarantine. The data collected included anthropometrics, sociodemographic data, clinical history, food frequency questionnaire responses, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores, Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) responses, and Perceived Stress Scale measures. In addition, during quarantine, COVID-19 and nutrition-related information and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores were collected. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the indicators of weight gain and loss from before COVID-19 (baseline) until during lockdown. RESULTS: Although approximately half of the participants did not report a weight change, 30% revealed weight loss and 18%, weight gain. The variables associated with increased weight gain were self-quarantine since COVID-19 started (OR: 5.17, 95% CI: 1.57-17.01, p = 0.007), age (OR: 1.53, 1.03-2.28, p = 0.04), and stress at baseline and during lockdown (OR: 1.15, 1.03-1.29, p = 0.01; OR: 1.10, 1.01-1.19, p = 0.03, respectively). The variables associated with a reduced risk of weight gain were the GPAQ score during lockdown (OR: 0.16, 0.04-0.66, p = 0.01), coffee consumption (OR: 0.36, 0.19-0.67, p = 0.01), and total sleep time (OR: 0.70, 0.51-0.97, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: While most young Saudi women experienced no weight change during the COVID-19 lockdown, one-third lost weight and a significant proportion gained weight. Factors associated with weight, such as stress, sleep hours, physical activity, and coffee consumption, highlight the need to carefully consider those at risk during future circumstances that may require lockdowns. These factors could also aid in implementing policies for future lockdowns and support those most at risk of gaining weight.","Al-Musharaf, Sara; Aljuraiban, Ghadeer; Bogis, Rania; Alnafisah, Ruyuf; Aldhwayan, Madhawi; Tahrani, Abd",PLoS One,,133

We observed that 13 of 17 patients with COVID-19 had stereotypic variable heavy chain (VH) antibody clonotypes directed against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These antibody clonotypes were composed of immunoglobulin heavy variable 3-53 (IGHV3-53) or IGHV3-66 and immunoglobulin heavy joining 6 (IGHJ6) genes. These clonotypes included IgM, IgG3, IgG1, IgA1, IgG2, and IgA2 subtypes and had minimal somatic mutations, which suggested swift class switching after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The different IGHV chains were paired with diverse light chains resulting in binding to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Human antibodies specific for the RBD can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting entry into host cells. We observed that one of these stereotypic neutralizing antibodies could inhibit viral replication in vitro using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that these VH clonotypes existed in 6 of 10 healthy individuals, with IgM isotypes predominating. These findings suggest that stereotypic clonotypes can develop de novo from naïve B cells and not from memory B cells established from prior exposure to similar viruses. The expeditious and stereotypic expansion of these clonotypes may have occurred in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 because they were already present.","Kim, Sang Il; Noh, Jinsung; Kim, Sujeong; Choi, Younggeun; Yoo, Duck Kyun; Lee, Yonghee; Lee, Hyunho; Jung, Jongtak; Kang, Chang Kyung; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Choe, Pyoeng Gyun; Kim, Hong Bin; Kim, Eu Suk; Kim, Nam-Joong; Seong, Moon-Woo; Park, Wan Beom; Oh, Myoung-Don; Kwon, Sunghoon; Chung, Junho",Sci. transl. med,,133
245788,COVID-19 infection in patients with mast cell disorders including mastocytosis does not impact mast cell activation symptoms,2021,"This note lays out the basic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological model of contagion, with a target audience of economists who want a framework for understanding the effects of social distancing and containment policies on the evolution of contagion and interactions with the economy. A key parameter, the asymptomatic rate (the fraction of the infected that are not tested under current guidelines), is not well estimated in the literature because tests for the coronavirus have been targeted at the sick and vulnerable, however it could be estimated by random sampling of the population. In this simple model, different policies that yield the same transmission rate beta have the same health outcomes but can have very different economic costs. Thus, one way to frame the economics of shutdown policy is as finding the most efficient policies to achieve a given beta, then determining the path of beta that trades off the economic cost against the cost of excess lives lost by overwhelming the health care system.","Stock, J.

The origin of this new virus is presumed zoonotic, with bats being its probable vector. Due to the rapid number of infections and deaths that occurred first in China and later around the world, the infection of this virus quickly went from being an isolated outbreak in a Chinese region to becoming a health emergency of international concern and later, a pandemic.

According to capacity-sharing accounts of multitasking, assuming a general pool of resources two tasks can draw upon, predictability should reduce the need for resources and allow more resources to be used by the other task. However, it is currently not well understood what drives resource-allocation policy in dual tasks and which resource allocation policies participants pursue. We used a continuous tracking task together with an audiomotor task and manipulated advance visual information about the tracking path in the first experiment and a sound sequence in the second experiments (2a/b). Results show that performance predominantly improved in the predictable task but not in the unpredictable task, suggesting that participants did not invest more resources into the unpredictable task. One possible explanation was that the re-investment of resources into another task requires some relationship between the tasks. Therefore, in the third experiment, we covaried the two tasks by having sounds 250 ms before turning points in the tracking curve. This enabled participants to improve performance in both tasks, suggesting that resources were shared better between tasks.","Broeker, Laura; Ewolds, Harald; de Oliveira, Rita F; Künzell, Stefan; Raab, Markus",Cogn Res Princ Implic,,133

In the case of Colombia, a series of measures focused on isolation and remote services provision were introduced in a context marked by health inequities. This article reviews the theoretical and normative references on primary care interventions in the Colombian response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A literature review was conducted in PubMed, LILACS, MEDLINE, and official documents and regulations issued in Colombia, the World Health Organization, and the Pan American Health Organization. A narrative synthesis was done of 33 documents based on their contribution to the implementation of primary care in Colombia and their role in the pandemic. Results: The information was organized into two categories: Actions taken in Colombia in response to COVID-19 and Opportunities in primary care in response to COVID-19. Colombias actions were contrasted with world experience. Better pandemic control was found in countries that adopted primary care as a response. Primary care has strengthened the handling of the pandemic through community action, the provision of coordinated services, mental health inclusion, and the adoption of telemedicine processes.

257143,SARS-CoV-2 Reinfection among Healthcare Workers in Mexico: Case Report and Literature Review,2021,"Recent studies indicate that detecting radiographic patterns on CT chest scans can yield high sensitivity and specificity for COVID-19 identification. In this paper, we scrutinize the effectiveness of deep learning models for semantic segmentation of pneumonia-infected area segmentation in CT images for the detection of COVID-19. Traditional methods for CT scan segmentation exploit a supervised learning paradigm, so they (a) require large volumes of data for their training, and (b) assume fixed (static) network weights once the training procedure has been completed. Recently, to overcome these difficulties, few-shot learning (FSL) has been introduced as a general concept of network model training using a very small amount of samples. In this paper, we explore the efficacy of few-shot learning in U-Net architectures, allowing for a dynamic fine-tuning of the network weights as new few samples are being fed into the U-Net. Experimental results indicate improvement in the segmentation accuracy of identifying COVID-19 infected regions. In particular, using 4-fold cross-validation results of the different classifiers, we observed an improvement of 5.388 ± 3.046% for all test data regarding the IoU metric and a similar increment of 5.394 ± 3.015% for the F1 score. Moreover, the statistical significance of the improvement obtained using our proposed few-shot U-Net architecture compared with the traditional U-Net model was confirmed by applying the Kruskal-Wallis test (p-value = 0.026).","Voulodimos, Athanasios; Protopapadakis, Eftychios; Katsamenis, Iason; Doulamis, Anastasios; Doulamis, Nikolaos",Sensors (Basel),,133

A meta-analysis using 17 nationally representative datasets with a total of 26,876 participants indicated that participants who approve of President Trump tend to approve of his leadership regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and were less likely to engage in personal protective behavior (PPBs;i.e., hand washing, wearing a mask or other face covering in public, and social distancing). On the other hand, those disapproving of President Trump also tended to disapprove of his leadership during the COVID-19 crisis and were more likely to engage in PPBs. In a second study, using an established measure of leader affect (leader affect questionnaire) and controlling for political party, we replicated and extended these results by demonstrating that expending cognitive effort toward understanding the COVID-19 crisis attenuated the relationship between affect toward President Trump and (1) approval of his leadership during the COVID-19 crisis and (2) engagement in some, but not all, PPBs.","Moss, Sherry E.; Kessler, Stacey R.; Martinko, Mark J.; Mackey, Jeremy D.",Journal of Leadership &amp; Organizational Studies,,133
257445,Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients Exhibit Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Serological Responses,2021,"BACKGROUND: Mandatory rules for social distancing to curb the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic require individuals to maintain a critical interpersonal distance above 1.5 m. However, this contradicts our natural preference, which is closer to 1 m for non-intimate encounters, for example, when asking a stranger for directions. OBJECTIVE: This review addresses how humans typically regulate interpersonal distances, in order to highlight the challenges of enforcing atypically large interpersonal distances. METHOD: To understand the challenges posed by social distancing requirements, we integrate relevant contributions from visual perception, social perception, and human factors. RESULTS: To date, research on preferred interpersonal distances suggests that social distancing could induce discomfort, heighten arousal, and decrease social signaling in the short term. While the protracted effects of social distancing are unclear, we propose hypotheses on the mid- to long-term consequences of violating preferred norms of interpersonal distances. CONCLUSION: We suggest that enforcing a physical distance of 1.5-2 m presents a serious challenge to behavioral norms. APPLICATION: We address how notifications, architectural design, and visualizations could be effectively applied to promote interpersonal distance requirements.","Welsch, Robin; Hecht, Heiko; Chuang, Lewis; von Castell, Christoph",Hum Factors,,133

We evaluated the performance of two commercially-available lateral flow immunochromatographic assays (LFIC) (Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test and the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV Ab test) in comparison with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization pseudotyped assay for COVID-19 diagnosis in hospitalized patients, and investigate whether the intensity of the test band in LFIC associates with neutralizing antibody (NtAb) titers. Ninety sera were included from 51 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter-based pseudotyped neutralization assay (vesicular stomatitis virus coated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) was used. Test line intensity was scored using a 4-level scale (0 to 3+). Overall sensitivity of LFIC assays was 91.1% for the Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test, 72.2% for the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgG, 85.6% for the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgM and 92.2% for the NtAb assay. Sensitivity increased for all assays in sera collected beyond day 14 after symptoms onset (93.9%, 79.6%,93.9% and 93.9%, respectively). Reactivities equal to or more intense than the positive control line (&#8805;2+) in the Wondfo assay had a negative predictive value of 100% and a positive predictive value of 96.4% for high NtAb50 titers (&#8805;1/160). Our findings support the use of LFIC assays evaluated herein, particularly the Wondfo test, for COVID-19 diagnosis.

271302,The Doctor Will Call You Now! Telemedicine in the Midst of a Pandemic,2020,"National tuberculosis programmes (NTPs) should aim for achieving a very high proportion of cure of all tuberculosis (TB) cases. Ineffective chemotherapy of TB that keeps a substantial proportion of patients alive without cure may amplify resistance during treatment and promote transmission of TB. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that in patients who require TB retreatment, the retreatment regimen that comprised 8 months of isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol supplemented by streptomycin for the initial 2 months, and pyrazinamide for the initial 3 months (2SHRZE/HRZE/5HRE) should no longer be prescribed and drug susceptibility testing (DST) should be conducted to inform the choice of treatment regimen. While GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay may detect rifampicin resistance, it does not detect isoniazid resistance. A 6-month regimen consisting of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol may be used for the treatment of previously treated cases in whom rifampicin resistance has been excluded but DST of isoniazid is not available. WHO recommended to treat isoniazid-resistant, rifampicin-susceptible TB (Hr-TB) with rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide and levofloxacin for a duration of 6 months. In several low- and middle-income countries, the majority of Hr-TB cases are detected after the initiation of treatment with first-line regimens. If patients have an unsatisfactory response to first-line treatment with persistent positive sputum, modification of regimens needs to be done very carefully. Adding a fluoroquinolone in cases with undetected rifampicin resistance runs the risk of acquired fluoroquinolone resistance. Recently, WHO advises NTPs to phase out the injectable-containing short regimen for multidrug-resistant and rifampicin-resistant TB (MDR-/RR-TB) and recommends that the preferred treatment option is a shorter, all-oral, bedaquiline-containing regimen. WHO emphasizes that access to rapid DST, especially for ruling out fluoroquinolone resistance, is required before starting the bedaquiline-containing shorter regimen. The problem is that access to rapid DST for ruling out fluoroquinolone resistance is limited in low- and middle-income countries. The use of WHO-recommended bedaquiline-containing regimens in the treatment of MDR-/RR-TB patients with undetected resistance to fluoroquinolones runs a high risk of acquired bedaquiline resistance, especially in settings with a high prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance. It is crucial to mitigate the risks of both primary and acquired resistance of rifampicin, fluoroquinolone and bedaquiline by rational design of regimens and effective management of TB patients.","Chiang, Chen-Yuan; Lin, Chou-Jui",Indian J Tuberc,,133

However, despite the mechanisms for zombie uprisings in pop culture, it is unknown whether zombies, from an evolutionary point of view, can actually rise from the dead. To provide insight into this unknown, we created a mathematical model that predicts the trajectory of human and zombie populations during a zombie apocalypse. We parameterized our model according to the demographics of the US, the zombie literature, and then conducted an evolutionary invasion analysis to determine conditions that permit the evolution of zombies. Our results indicate a zombie invasion is theoretically possible, provided there is a sufficiently large ratio of transmission rate to the zombie death rate. While achieving this ratio is uncommon in nature, the existence of zombie ant fungus illustrates it is possible and thereby suggests that a zombie apocalypse among humans could occur.","Kumari, Alisha; Reece, Elijah; Tosun, Kursad; Greenhalgh, Scott",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02315v1.pdf,133

277115,Testing for Novel Coronavirus Antibodies: A Necessary Adjunct,2020,"PURPOSE: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has almost stopped all elective surgical treatment throughout the world. As operating room (OR) capacities are reduced everywhere to ensure availability of intensive care capacities, especially low-complex surgical procedures are often postponed. These include totally implantable central-venous access ports which are important for the oncologic treatment of cancer patients. METHODS: In our study, we investigated the potential of an outpatient surgical centre (OSC) in terms of workflow effectiveness compared to the central operating room complex (COR) of a university hospital using low-complex surgical procedures as an example. Data of 524 consecutive patients who received a Port-a-cath procedure (422 implantations (80.5%) and 102 explantations (19.5%)) in our department between February 2019 and February 2020 were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 277 patients were operated in outpatient surgical centre (OSC), and 247 patients received the procedure in the central OR (COR) complex. Grade II and III complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification occurred in 5.2% (OSC) and 7.3% (COR) of patients. Incision-to-suture time was significantly quicker in the OSC group (36 vs. 42 min., p < 0.032). Total OR time (01:08 vs. 01:20 h) and preparation-to-incision time were also shorter in the OSC group (12 vs. 17 min., p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: In order to ensure effective OR utilization especially in times of the corona pandemic, the use of smaller decentralized OR units, e.g., outpatient surgical centres, for performing low-complex surgical cases is beneficial. Our study revealed shorter total OR and preparation-to-incision times.","Vogel, Thomas; Schippers, Dina; Aldarweesh, Balqees; Pergolini, Ilaria; Stollreiter, Martina; Wagner, Klaus; Wilhelm, Dirk; Friess, Helmut; Kranzfelder, Michael",Int. j. comput. assist. radiol. surg.

The research goal was to compare the effects of weekly personal feedback, based on objectively measured physical activity, on the trends of both daily sedentary time and on the physical activity of BCS (E− group) with those of an intervention also including online supervised physical exercise sessions (E+ group), during the Italy COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: The Italian COVID-19 emergency allowed the possibility to also observe the effects of social and personal limitations. A total of 51 BCS were studied over an 18-week period and had an objective registration of day-to-day sedentary time, physical activity, and sleep. Both subsamples received weekly or fortnight personal feedback. Data were analysed considering four key periods, according to the COVID-19 emergency steps. Results: Statistical analysis showed an additive effect for sedentary time and a multiplicative effect both for light-to vigorous and light-intensity physical activities. The E− group had a high overall sedentary time and a different trend of light-to vigorous and light-intensity physical activities, with a reduction from the 1st to the 2nd periods (national and personal restrictions), showing a significant rise just at the end of the national restrictions.

We aimed to describe the glycaemic status pre- and post-pancreatectomy, compare patients' clinical characteristics, group according to pre- and post-pancreatectomy diabetes mellitus (DM) status and identify predictors of post-operative PDM. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients admitted for pancreatic resection at a single institution from 2011 to 2017. Post-operative DM status was determined at the time of discharge or at 30 days post-operation. Longer term DM onset was as documented in medical record subsequent to admission for pancreatic surgery. RESULTS: A total of 137 cases were analysed; 13.3% and 24.8% of patients developed post-operative PDM within 30 days and at median of 1 year (range 1-4 years) follow-up, respectively. All patients with pre-existing DM continued to have DM post-operatively. Patients with pre-existing DM were older (P = 0.004) and had a family history of DM (P = 0.020); 8.3% of patients who had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy versus 17.1% of patients who had undergone distal pancreatectomy developed PDM (P = 0.318). A lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.033) was significantly associated with post-operative PDM development. No independent predictors for post-operative PDM were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The new development of DM within 30 days post-pancreatectomy occurs in approximately one in seven persons. No patients with pre-existing DM demonstrated a remission of DM post-pancreatectomy. These findings suggest that all patients should be screened for DM pre-operatively and followed up post-operatively, particularly those with pre-existing impaired renal function.","Lee, Cynthia Ying Chian; Depczynski, Barbara; Poynten, Ann; Haghighi, Koroush S",ANZ j.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, survey-based study was conducted at Islamic International Dental College, Islamabad, Pakistan. After taking an informed consent, a validated and pretested Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ) was distributed amongst the undergraduate dental students at two points, one before the COVID-19 existed, and the other after August 7th, 2020, when the COVID-19 cases dropped in Pakistan. Responses were indicated on a five point Likert Scale. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) was used to compare the TEQ scores between the different years of education at the dental school. Difference within the groups was analyzed using the post-hoc Tukey test. Pre- and post-COVID-19 comparison was done using the Chi-square test (significance level p < 0.05). RESULTS: A total of 221 out of 260 students in the pre-COVID-19 group, while 210 out of 260 students in the post-COVID-19 group enrolled in the dentistry program participated in the study. Significant difference in the empathy levels was observed in the pre- and post-COVID-19 groups of the same population, i.e., (p < 0.05). The response rate was 85%. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed an increase in mean empathy scores among the undergraduate dental students after COVID-19, indicating a significant improvement in their empathy levels during the time of COVID-19. It highlights the impact of the pandemic, whereby death and chaos seem to have brought about an improvement in interpersonal harmony.","Ghaus, Sundas; Waheed, Madiha Abdul; Khan, Shahreen Zahid; Mustafa, Laila; Siddique, Sohaib; Quershi, Ali Waqar",European journal of dentistry,,133

Though uniformity across recommendations from clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) is desirable, historically, national guidelines from Diabetes Canada (DC) and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) have differed. Lack of consensus has led to variation in screening approaches, rendering precise ascertainment of GDM prevalence challenging. To highlight the reason and level of disparity in Canada, we conducted a scoping review of CPGs released by DC and the SOGC over the last thirty years and distributed a survey on screening practices among Canadian physicians. Earlier CPGs were based on expert opinion, leading to different recommendations from these organizations. However, as a result of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study, disparities between DC and the SOGC no longer exist and many Canadian physicians have adopted their recent recommendations. Given that Canadian guidelines now recommend two different screening programs (one step vs. two step), lack of consensus on a single diagnostic threshold continues to exist, resulting in differing estimates of GDM prevalence. Our scoping review highlights these disparities and provides a step forward towards reaching a consensus on one unified threshold.","Mussa, Joseph; Meltzer, Sara; Bond, Rachel; Garfield, Natasha; Dasgupta, Kaberi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,133

BACKGROUND: Working on the front lines of COVID-19 has brought unprecedented psychological stress on pre-examination and triage nurses. Nurse-patient communication ability and the level of self-efficacy are both significant for nurses' psychosomatic health and work input. However, limited empirical evidence exists regarding nurse-patient communication and self-efficacy and specific psychological intervention effects. DESIGN: Cross-sectional research fulfilling the completed checklist of items that should be included in reports of cross-sectional studies (Appendix S1). METHODS: Nurses (n = 41) in the first layer of pre-examination and triage were engaged in a Balint group activity twice a week for two weeks. They were assessed with the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) pre- and postintervention, and a nurse-patient communication survey form was developed for further postintervention evaluation. The sample was recruited from a class A third-grade hospital in Sichuan, China. RESULTS: Most of the subjects reported improvement in nurse-patient communication, increased cooperation between patients and their families, and a decreased missed examination rate after the intervention. Moreover, the total mean score of the GSES of nurses after the intervention was increased, but the difference was not statistically significant. The scores of all items in the GSES were improved, and the scores increase for item 4 (I am confident that I can effectively deal with any unexpected event) was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a short-term Balint group activity can improve the communication ability and self-efficacy level of front-line nurses to some extent. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This information may provide some theoretical support for the development of early psychological interventions during major epidemic situations.","Yang, Chenghui; Zhou, Bo; Wang, Jinyu; Pan, Shuya",J. clin. nurs,,133
296447,Outcomes of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection previously treated with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors,2021,"China had suffered the COVID-19 outbreak from the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 began to spread secretly within the community and in hospitals, causing numerous citizens to be infected without knowing it. After the official confirmation of COVID-19, hospital diagnosis and treatment systems were under great pressure, and medical supplies were scarce. Then the pandemic experienced an explosive growth and quickly peaked. In order to respond to the challenge, the Chinese government quickly built hospitals, adjusted the diagnosis and treatment systems, deployed medical staff to support areas affected by the epidemic, isolated and treated infected patients as much as possible, reminded citizens to use good protection, and controlled the epidemic step-by-step. In this paper, we used official published data and medical literature about the transmission of COVID-19 as well as prevention and control guidelines issued by the Chinese government and hospitals, adopted a multi-dimensional analysis framework, divided the outbreak into three phases: (1) ""blind man touching the elephant"" phase, (2) ""opening Pandora's box"" phase, (3) ""whole offensive and whole defensive tactics"" phase. This was done to describe the development of and response to the pandemic. This paper suggested that when dealing with similar outbreaks in the future, we should do a better job of providing protective guidance and material reserves in advance, strengthen the emergency response capacity of medical institutions, and aim to share this information with the public medical systems of other countries which also face severe tests.","Yu, Xiang; Li, Na",J Infect Public Health,,133
296458,SARS-CoV-2 viremia may predict rapid deterioration of COVID-19 patients,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The recent pandemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with a lethal atypical pneumonia, making COVID-19 an urgent public health issue with an increasing rate of mortality and morbidity. There are currently no vaccines or therapeutics available for COVID-19, which is causing an urgent search for a new drug to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The lipid membrane alternation efficiency of small antimicrobial lipopeptides enables them to block viral membrane fusion to the host cell. Lipopeptides could serve as potential antiviral agents, by interacting or competing with viral fusion proteins. METHODS: This study screened seven different lipopeptides (tsushimycin, daptomycin, surfactin, bacillomycin, iturin, srfTE, and LPD-12) and docked them individually against the spike (S)-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Based on the maximum docked score and minimum atomic contact energy, LPD-12 (-1137.38 kcal) was the appropriate molecule for proper binding with the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and thus significantly interrupted its affinity of binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which is the only receptor molecule found to be facilitating disease development. The results confirmed a strong binding affinity of LPD-12 with ACE2, with a binding free energy of -1621.62 kcal, which could also reciprocally prevent the binding of S-protein. CONCLUSTION: It can be concluded that LPD-12 may act as a potential therapeutic drug, by reducing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 to the human cells via the ACE2 receptor and related infections.","Chowdhury, Trinath; Baindara, Piyush; Mandal, Santi M",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,133

We validate this technique by measuring the kinetics of irreversible binding for the antibodies immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) as they attach to micrometer-diameter colloidal beads coated with protein A. These measurements yield the antibodies' binding rates and can be inverted to obtain the concentration of antibodies in solution. Holographic molecular binding assays therefore can be used to perform fast quantitative immunoassays that are complementary to conventional serological tests.,"Snyder, Kaitlynn; Quddus, Rushna; Hollingsworth, Andrew D.; Kirshenbaum, Kent; Grier, David G.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09447v1.pdf,133

This study sought to identify interprofessional barriers and facilitators for use of MOUD (specifically naltrexone and buprenorphine) among current and future primary care providers in a southeastern academic center in South Carolina. METHOD: Faculty, residents, and students within family medicine, internal medicine, and a physician assistant program participated in focus group interviews, and completed a brief survey. Survey data were analyzed quantitatively, and focus group transcripts were analyzed using a deductive qualitative content analysis, based upon the theory of planned behavior. RESULTS: Seven groups (N = 46) completed focus group interviews and surveys. Survey results indicated that general attitudes towards MOUD were positive and did not differ significantly among groups. Subjective norms around prescribing and controllability (i.e., beliefs about whether prescribing was up to them) differed between specialties and between level of training groups. Focus group themes highlighted attitudes about MOUD (e.g., ""opens the flood gates"" to patients with addiction) and perceived facilitators and barriers of using MOUD in primary care settings. Participants felt that although MOUD in primary care would improve access and reduce stigma for patients, prescribing requires improved provider education and an integrated system of care. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide an argument for tailoring education to specifically address the barriers primary care prescribers perceive. Results promote the utilization of active, hands-on learning approaches, to ultimately promote uptake of MOUD prescribing in the primary care setting in South Carolina.","Oros, Sarah M; Christon, Lillian M; Barth, Kelly S; Berini, Carole R; Padgett, Bennie L; Diaz, Vanessa A",Int J Psychiatry Med,,133

Purpose To evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) system for detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest radiographs. Materials and Methods An AI system (CAD4COVID-XRay) was trained on 24 678 chest radiographs, including 1540 used only for validation while training. The test set consisted of a set of continuously acquired chest radiographs (n = 454) obtained in patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia between March 4 and April 6, 2020, at one center (223 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] results, 231 with negative RT-PCR results). Radiographs were independently analyzed by six readers and by the AI system. Diagnostic performance was analyzed with the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results For the test set, the mean age of patients was 67 years ± 14.4 (standard deviation) (56% male). With RT-PCR test results as the reference standard, the AI system correctly classified chest radiographs as COVID-19 pneumonia with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81. The system significantly outperformed each reader (P < .001 using the McNemar test) at their highest possible sensitivities. At their lowest sensitivities, only one reader significantly outperformed the AI system (P = .04). Conclusion The performance of an artificial intelligence system in the detection of coronavirus disease 2019 on chest radiographs was comparable with that of six independent readers. © RSNA, 2020.","Murphy, Keelin; Smits, Henk; Knoops, Arnoud J G; Korst, Michael B J M; Samson, Tijs; Scholten, Ernst T; Schalekamp, Steven; Schaefer-Prokop, Cornelia M; Philipsen, Rick H H M; Meijers, Annet; Melendez, Jaime; van Ginneken, Bram; Rutten, Matthieu",Radiology,,133

COVID-19 changed education in unprecedented ways, leaving many marketing educators teaching courses online for the first time. The change in modality motivated our research to understand a students’ perspective of what practices have and have not worked in this pandemic-constrained learning environment. Using a phronetic, iterative approach, we analyze 110 student reflections from 3 different marketing courses that transitioned online in the lock-down. The qualitative exploration of this rapid transition from the classroom to online course delivery reveals the use of synchronous video-conference platforms enables student-centered practices that can increase social presence and enhance students’ motivation, engagement, and perceived learning. We develop a conceptual continuum between transactional distance and social presence where these important student-centered dimensions can be influenced by faculty practices. Based on our results we develop a pathway to successful learning. Actionable propositions are offered to aid faculty in increasing social presence in the online delivery of marketing education. This study provides student insights and faculty guidance to design virtual course offerings that demonstrate motivating and engaging to students despite physical separation between faculty and students.

The Covid-19 pandemic has opened such a door in societies worldwide. We outline in this commentary some of these social elements and how they may have influenced face mask use during the early stages of the pandemic. The purpose is to expand the perspective on mechanisms that are relevant to consider in pandemic response planning. Our look at these fundamental elements showed that latent aspects of the dominant culture and various symbolic meanings of behaviors can reduce adherence with public health recommendations if they are overlooked in the strategic health plans. We conclude that when policymakers decide non-pharmacological interventions during pandemics, they should take into account fundamental attitudes and beliefs that may influence population behavior.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey. METHODS: A survey questionnaire was conducted with 200 industry workers (68% males and 32% females) who had previously tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The survey examined participants' self-reported general attitudes towards coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), their sense of fear, as well as their behaviour towards protective measures before and after the testing. RESULTS: Participants perceived the disease as a severe health threat and acknowledged that the protective measures were appropriate. Respondents reported a high level of adherence to measures and low level of fear, both before and after the testing. Although these indicators were statistically significantly reduced after the test (P < 0.004), they did not result in irresponsible non-adherence behaviours. Almost all respondents attributed their application of personal protection measures to factors other than the results of serological screening. CONCLUSIONS: Serological tests do not contribute to irresponsible non-adherence behaviours in an environment where protective measures are efficient. However, they may help reduce fear within society and working environments.","Ljubic, T; Banovac, A; Buljan, I; Jerkovic, I; Basic, Z; Kruzic, I; Kolic, A; Kolombatovic, R R; Marusic, A; Andelinovic, S",Public Health,,133
310108,Clinically Significant COVID-19 Following SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Kidney Transplant Recipients,2021,"BACKGROUND: About 10-35% of people with COVID-19 need medical care within 3 weeks of infection. However, the prevalence of ongoing care needs among those experiencing severe COVID-19 illness is unclear. AIM: This pilot study aimed to address this knowledge gap by examining GP attendance trends among patients attending a post-COVID-19 hospital follow-up clinic, 3-6 months after an initial clinic visit. DESIGN & SETTING: Data were collected from adult patients attending a post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (MMUH), Dublin, Ireland. METHOD: Participants completed questionnaires outlining their demographics; medical histories; emergency hospital admissions and readmissions where applicable; and, where relevant, GP attendances following hospital discharge. Analyses were conducted using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: Participants' (n = 153) median age was 43.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 30.9-52.1 years). There were 105 females (68.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 61.3% to 75.9%). Various medical histories were reported among participants. Sixty-seven (43.2%, 95% CI = 35.9% to 51.6%) received emergency COVID-19 hospital care. Older adults, males, intensive care unit [ICU] admissions, and readmissions were common among hospital attendees. Of the hospital attendees, 16 (24%, 95% CI = 13.7% to 34.2%) attended GPs within 7 days of hospital discharge, and 26 (39%, 95% CI = 27.3% to 50.7%) within 30 days. Older adults, people with pre-existing medical conditions, and individuals admitted to ICU and/or readmitted to hospital were common among general practice attendees.

The present paper is a comment on E. Gibney's article 'Whose coronavirus strategy worked best?' (Nature 2020;581:15-6). The strategy for phase 2 should be more complex and interdisciplinary than described in the paper in Nature, especially in the period before a vaccine and specific treatments are available. The focus on reducing the mortality of COVID-19 will have side effects, including excess mortality from other causes. A part of this excess mortality will be based on the reduction of health-care offers as a consequence of the pandemic, and on structural limitations of the health-care system. A special challenge is to understand the relationship between death from and death with COVID-19, and therefore the relevance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in people with pre-existing burdens, for example coronary heart disease, cancer or older age. There is a need to extend the recently used tools to all available instruments, including physiological principles of prevention and promotion. The way to integrate global solidarity into the strategies of the different countries is critical not only for global health but also for the peace and long-term success for each individual country. The consequences of efforts against COVID-19 and the impact on reduced air pollution and climate change are also important to analyse from a global health perspective.","Kofler, Walter; Glazachev, Oleg S; Lyshol, Heidi; Tellnes, Gunnar",Scand J Public Health,,133

318197,Relatively mild symptoms after chronic overdose with a double-dose encorafenib: a case report,2021,"In this paper we propose an epidemiological model for the spread of COVID-19. The dynamics of the spread is based on four fundamental categories of people in a population: Tested and infected, Non-Tested but infected, Tested but not infected, and non-Tested and not infected. The model is based on two levels of dynamics of spread in the population: at local level and at the global level. The local level growth is described with data and parameters which include testing statistics for COVID-19, preventive measures such as nationwide lockdown, and the migration of people across neighboring locations. In the context of India, the local locations are considered as districts and migration or traffic flow across districts are defined by normalized edge weight of the metapopulation network of districts which are infected with COVID-19. Based on this local growth, state level predictions for number of people tested with COVID-19 positive are made. Further, considering the local locations as states, prediction is made for the country level. The values of the model parameters are determined using grid search and minimizing an error function while training the model with real data. The predictions are made based on the present statistics of testing, and certain linear and log-linear growth of testing at state and country level. Finally, it is shown that the spread can be contained if number of testing can be increased linearly or log-linearly by certain factors along with the preventive measures in near future. This is also necessary to prevent the sharp growth in the count of infected and to get rid of the second wave of pandemic.","Banerjee, Buddhananda; Pandey, Pradumn Kumar; Adhikari, Bibhas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06404v1.pdf,133

Cognitive rehabilitation therapies are used with the goal of improving memory functioning; however, not all patients benefit. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for employing effective memory strategies. We hypothesized that memory improvement after a brief cognitive intervention would be associated with increases in PFC activation during a memory task. Methods: The current study used behavioral analyses and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the effects of two days of intensive semantic encoding strategy training on memory performance and brain activation patterns in patients in the post-acute stage of TBI. fMRI data were collected before and after training while participants learned word lists. Results: Post-training vs. pre-training changes in total recall and semantic clustering during recall were positively correlated with post-training vs. pre-training changes in neural activation in PFC. Conclusions: These results suggest that variability in treatment response to cognitive training after TBI may be due in part to variability in PFC function, and that some survivors of TBIs may benefit from treatments specifically targeting the PFC.","Lepping, Rebecca J; Brooks, William M; Kirchhoff, Brenda A; Martin, Laura E; Kurylo, Monica; Ladesich, Linda; Lierman, Jo Ann; Varghese, George; Savage, Cary R",,,133

It has placed unusual demands on healthcare delivery systems, including physiotherapy services worldwide. This challenge is even larger than the one placed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Ebola because of its sheer virulence. Times are changing;we need to do the same and accept the challenge head on. The role of a physiotherapist in the management of the COVID-19 patients is well established but an important issue is the management of non-COVID-19 as well as COVID-19 patients judiciously during these times. The various barriers to practice have increased manifold due to the condition as well as the associated problems which arose due to it. This commentary will comment on the likely impact of this pandemic over the existing physiotherapy delivery structure, challenges arising out of it and their probable solutions, ending with a brief note on India.","Veqar, Z.",Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research,,133

As our knowledge about innate immune factors of the respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 is limited, we generated and screened a peptide/protein library derived from bronchoalveolar lavage for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 spike-driven entry. Analysis of antiviral fractions revealed the presence of &#945;1-antitrypsin (&#945;1AT), a highly abundant circulating serine protease inhibitor. Here, we report that &#945;1AT inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry at physiological concentrations and suppresses viral replication in cell lines and primary cells including human airway epithelial cultures. We further demonstrate that &#945;1AT binds and inactivates the serine protease TMPRSS2, which enzymatically primes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for membrane fusion. Thus, the acute phase protein &#945;1AT is an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 entry, and may play an important role in the innate immune defense against the novel coronavirus. Our findings suggest that repurposing of &#945;1AT-containing drugs has prospects for the therapy of COVID-19.","Wettstein, Lukas; Weil, Tatjana; Conzelmann, Carina; Müller, Janis A; Groß, Rüdiger; Hirschenberger, Maximilian; Seidel, Alina; Klute, Susanne; Zech, Fabian; Prelli Bozzo, Caterina; Preising, Nico; Fois, Giorgio; Lochbaum, Robin; Knaff, Philip Maximilian; Mailänder, Volker; Ständker, Ludger; Thal, Dietmar Rudolf; Schumann, Christian; Stenger, Steffen; Kleger, Alexander; Lochnit, Günter; Mayer, Benjamin; Ruiz-Blanco, Yasser B; Hoffmann, Markus; Sparrer, Konstantin M J; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Sanchez-Garcia, Elsa; Kirchhoff, Frank; Frick, Manfred; Münch, Jan",Nat Commun,,133

332409,The burden of cutaneous disease in solid organ transplant recipients of color,2020,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major organizational challenges to healthcare systems concerning staff, material and bed availability. Nutrition was not a priority in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the beginning of the pandemic with the need for simplified protocols. We aimed to assess the impact of a simplified nutritional protocol for critically ill COVID-19 patients during the pandemic first wave. METHODS: We included all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections, admitted to the ICU of the Geneva University Hospitals for at least 4 days from March 9 to May 19, 2020. Data on the route and solution of nutritional therapy, prescribed and received volume, calorie and protein intake, amount of insulin, propofol and glucose administered were collected daily during the entire ICU stay. We compared nutritional outcomes between patients admitted to the ICU before and after implementing the simplified nutritional protocol using unpaired t-test. RESULTS: Out of 119 patients, 48 were hospitalized in the ICU before, 47 across and 24 after the implementation of the nutritional protocol. The mean age was 63.2 (±12.7) years and 76% were men without significant difference between before and after group. The nutritional protocol implementation led to an increase in caloric intake (1070 vs. 1357 kcal/day, p = 0.018) and in the percentage of days within 80-100% of the energy target (11 vs. 20%, p = 0.021). The protein debt decreased significantly from 48 g/day to 37 g/day (p = 0.015). No significant difference in the percentage of days within the protein target (80-100%) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Calorie and protein coverage improved after the implementation of the simplified nutritional protocol in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of such an approach on patients' clinical outcomes.","de Watteville, Aude; Montalbano, Florencia; Wozniak, Hannah; Collet, Tinh-Hai; Jaksic, Cyril; Le Terrier, Christophe; Pugin, Jérôme; Genton, Laurence; Heidegger, Claudia Paula",Clin. nutr.

Although markers of inflammation, cardiac injury, and coagulopathy have been previously associated with mortality in the general population of patients with COVID-19, their prognostic impact amongst KTR with SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been specifically investigated. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of 49 KTR who presented with COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory risk factors for severe disease and mortality were prospectively collected and analyzed with respect to outcomes. The study participants were divided into 3 groups: 1) mild disease manageable in an outpatient setting (n = 8), 2) nonsevere disease requiring hospitalization (n = 21), and 3) severe disease (n = 20). RESULTS: Gastrointestinal manifestations were common at diagnosis. The 30-day mortality rate in hospitalized patients was 19.5%. Early elevations of C-reactive protein (>100 mg/L) and interleukin-6 (>65 ng/L) followed by increases in high-sensitivity troponin I (>30 ng/L) and D-dimer (>960 ng/mL) were significantly associated with severe disease and mortality. Viral load did not have prognostic significance in our sample, suggesting that outcomes were chiefly driven by a cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

333513,"Collateral Benefit of COVID-19 Control Measures on Influenza Activity, Taiwan",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Since the first reports of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, the disease has spread worldwide. Different social isolation strategies have been adopted to reduce community transmission, but few studies have evaluated the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection in a family cluster during periods of isolation. We report an outbreak in 24 members of a family cluster during a period of social distancing. METHODOLOGY: We carried out an observational descriptive study of a family cluster infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil. Laboratory confirmation included RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal samples or IgM or IgG serology. RESULTS: The attack rates were 75% (19/24) based on laboratory-confirmed cases and 87.5% (21/24) including probable cases. The time of spread was 17 days from the first case. All patients had mild symptoms, requiring no hospitalization, and none of them died. The frequency of symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed patients was higher among adults (94%) than among children (50%); the paediatric age group also had a higher frequency of exposed individuals who remained negative for infection. Ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography were present in all patients with reported dyspnoea. CONCLUSION: This study highlights a high risk of intrahousehold transmission from an index case, suggesting the need for (I) specific guidelines during periods of social distancing, (II) minimization of external exposures and, above all, (III) adoption of strict quarantine measures for suspected cases and family members to prevent outbreaks from spreading.","Brito, Carlos Alexandre Antunes de; Brito, Marina Coelho Moraes de; Martins, Thiago Henrique Fernandes; Brito, Cecília Coelho Moraes de; Albuquerque, Maria Fátima Militão; Brito, Rita de Cássia Coelho Moraes de",J Infect Dev Ctries,,133

The consumption of isoflavonoids is increasing in the general population, especially due to the use of food supplements and a variety of isoflavonoid-rich foods. However, detailed studies on the vascular influence of individual pure isoflavonoids are mostly missing. For this study, 16 isoflavonoids were initially screened for their vasorelaxant properties on rat aortas. The 2 most potent of them, biochanin A and glycitein, were further tested for the mechanism of action on porcine coronary arteries. They both induced an endothelium independent vascular relaxation, with EC50 below 6 and 17 µM, respectively. Biochanin A, but not glycitein, was able to block the vasoconstriction caused by KCl, CaCl2, serotonin, and U46619 in a dose-dependent manner. Another series of experiments suggested that the major mechanism of action of biochanin A was the inhibition of L-type calcium channels. Moreover, biochanin A in relatively small concentrations (2â-â4 µM) interfered with the cGMP, but not cAMP, pathway in isolated coronary arteries. These results indicate that some isoflavonoids, in particular biochanin A, are able to have vasodilatory effects in micromolar concentrations, which is of potential clinical interest for the management of cardiovascular pathologies.","Migkos, Thomas; Pourová, Jana; Voprsalová, Marie; Auger, Cyril; Schini-Kerth, Valérie; Mladenka, Premysl",Planta med,,133

Not only affecting the lungs but also provoking acute respiratory distress, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is able to infect multiple cell types including cardiac and vascular cells. Hence a significant proportion of infected patients develop cardiac events, such as arrhythmias and heart failure. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities are at highest risk of cardiac death. To face the pandemic and limit its burden, health authorities have launched several fast-track calls for research projects aiming to develop rapid strategies to combat the disease, as well as longer-term projects to prepare for the future. Biomarkers have the possibility to aid in clinical decision-making and tailoring healthcare in order to improve patient quality of life. The biomarker potential of circulating RNAs has been recognized in several disease conditions, including cardiovascular disease. RNA biomarkers may be useful in the current COVID-19 situation. The discovery, validation, and marketing of novel biomarkers, including RNA biomarkers, require multi-centre studies by large and interdisciplinary collaborative networks, involving both the academia and the industry. Here, members of the EU-CardioRNA COST Action CA17129 summarize the current knowledge about the strain that COVID-19 places on the cardiovascular system and discuss how RNA biomarkers can aid to limit this burden.

In order to address this, we interrogate the evolutionary history of the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome to identify evolutionarily conserved functional sites that can inform the search for treatments with broader coverage across the coronavirus family. RESULTS: Combining coronavirus family sequence information with the mutations observed in the current COVID-19 outbreak, we systematically and comprehensively define evolutionarily stable sites that may provide useful drug and vaccine targets and which are less likely to be compromised by the emergence of new virus strains. Several experimentally-validated effective drugs interact with these proposed target sites. In addition, the same evolutionary information can prioritize cross reactive antigens that are useful in directing multi-epitope vaccine strategies to illicit broadly neutralizing immune responses to the betacoronavirus family. Although the results are focused on SARS-CoV-2, these approaches stem from evolutionary principles that are agnostic to the organism or infective agent.

The perception of happiness differs from one person to another; however, happiness can be defined as a general feeling that people feel and share. The United Arab Emirates puts forth great efforts to achieve happiness amongst people who live in it. In aligning with the Happiness Meter that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) launched , this research study aims to measure the level of happiness among higher education students and its relationship with their academic success during the lockdown period of COVID-19. Exploring whether the happiness level predicts students' success and if a gender-based difference in the feeling of happiness and well-being resides. The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ) was used to conducting this research project. Simple linear regression and t-test for independent samples were used to achieving the purpose of the study. Data analysis revealed that higher education students in the UAE have high levels of happiness and academic success; the students' happiness levels were found to be correlated to their academic success. T-test demonstrated that there was no gender-based difference in the happiness level among the students of higher education settings.","Moussa, Nahla M; Ali, Wael F",Psychol Rep,,133

Due to a lack of reliable confirmatory laboratory tests, the diagnosis of KD is based on a characteristic pattern of clinical findings that appear in a typical temporal sequence. The diagnostic criteria have been periodically modified and the American Heart Association has proposed the most recent guidelines for its diagnosis. However, patients may have incomplete or atypical forms of KD and diagnosis can often be difficult. Because oropharyngeal manifestations are a common and important feature for diagnosing KD and recent studies have hypothesized a possible association between KD and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in this review we highlight the importance of dentists in the diagnosis of KD and its potential association with SARS-CoV-2.","Martelli Júnior, Hercílio; Machado, Renato Assis; Martelli, Daniella Reis Barbosa; Barbosa, Mauro Costa; Bonan, Paulo Rogério Ferreti; Coletta, Ricardo Della",Braz. oral res.

Purpose To report abdominal imaging findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Materials and Methods In this retrospective cross-sectional study, patients consecutively admitted to a single quaternary care center from March 27 to April 10, 2020, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Abdominal imaging studies performed in these patients were reviewed, and salient findings were recorded. Medical records were reviewed for clinical data. Univariable analysis and logistic regression were performed. Results A total of 412 patients (average age, 57 years; range, 18 to >90 years; 241 men, 171 women) were evaluated. A total of 224 abdominal imaging studies were performed (radiography, n = 137; US, n = 44; CT, n = 42; MRI, n = 1) in 134 patients (33%). Abdominal imaging was associated with age (odds ratio [OR], 1.03 per year of increase; P = .001) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR, 17.3; P < .001). Bowel-wall abnormalities were seen on 31% of CT images (13 of 42) and were associated with ICU admission (OR, 15.5; P = .01). Bowel findings included pneumatosis or portal venous gas, seen on 20% of CT images obtained in patients in the ICU (four of 20). Surgical correlation (n = 4) revealed unusual yellow discoloration of the bowel (n = 3) and bowel infarction (n = 2). Pathologic findings revealed ischemic enteritis with patchy necrosis and fibrin thrombi in arterioles (n = 2). Right upper quadrant US examinations were mostly performed because of liver laboratory findings (87%, 32 of 37), and 54% (20 of 37) revealed a dilated sludge-filled gallbladder, suggestive of bile stasis. Patients with a cholecystostomy tube placed (n = 4) had negative bacterial cultures. Conclusion Bowel abnormalities and gallbladder bile stasis were common findings on abdominal images of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Patients who underwent laparotomy often had ischemia, possibly due to small-vessel thrombosis. © RSNA, 2020.","Bhayana, Rajesh; Som, Avik; Li, Matthew D; Carey, Denston E; Anderson, Mark A; Blake, Michael A; Catalano, Onofrio; Gee, Michael S; Hahn, Peter F; Harisinghani, Mukesh; Kilcoyne, Aoife; Lee, Susanna I; Mojtahed, Amirkasra; Pandharipande, Pari V; Pierce, Theodore T; Rosman, David A; Saini, Sanjay; Samir, Anthony E; Simeone, Joseph F; Gervais, Debra A; Velmahos, George; Misdraji, Joseph; Kambadakone, Avinash",Radiology,,133

This research aimed to investigate if written communications of the most commonly sought sources of COVID-19 information available on the internet have readability levels commensurate with those of the general public. METHODS: Online documents from the World Health Organization (WHO), and the governments of Australia, the UK and the US were assessed for readability using an online instrument that calculated scores for the Flesch Reading Ease Score, the SMOG Index and the Readability Consensus Grade Level. RESULTS: Similar to the previous research, most documents assessed had a readability standard that was at or above the recommended grade level, and as such inaccessible to substantial portions of the general public. A one-way ANOVA with post hoc tests revealed significant differences among the data, with Australian documents significantly more difficult to read than those from the UK and US. CONCLUSIONS: Government departments need to consider their audience and monitor readability of the documents they produce to ensure that readers can understand them. Implications for public health: Health communications need to be written at a level appropriate for the targeted population in order to be fit for purpose.","Ferguson, Catherine; Merga, Margaret; Winn, Stephen",Aust.

349867,When should we use corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia?,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Frontline healthcare providers are redeployed to areas outside their clinical expertise and assigned high-loading workload to address the surge of patients with each coronavirus outbreak. Their importance in crisis is not in doubt. However, they experienced considerable physical distress and psychological stressors, even leading to psychological illness and infection in this environment. There is an urgent need to accurately, comprehensively and objectively understand their experiences, perceptions and current situation of burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, insomnia and coronavirus infection. Therefore, this protocol is to conduct a mixed-methods systematic review to summarise the evidence on the experiences of healthcare providers and impacts of the coronavirus on their psychological status and infection during the pandemics. METHODS: Published studies on experience, perspective, impact, burnout, PTSD, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and infection of healthcare providers with SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome and COVID-19, and written in English and Chinese will be accepted. Databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, PubMed, Psychology Information, WanFang and SinoMed) from inception until 30 July 2020 will be searched. Two reviewers will select, screen, extract data and assess the risk of bias independently. Risk of bias of results will be using the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. Using a convergent integrated approach on qualitative/quantitative studies, we will synthesise qualitative and quantitative data separately. The incidence and number of cases about burnout, PTSD, anxiety, depression, insomnia and coronavirus infection among medical staff will be extracted. Then we will transform quantitative data to synthesise narrative findings. This protocol will be reported per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical assessment is not required due to the nature of the proposed systematic review. Findings of our research will be disseminated at conferences related to this field and through publication in peer-reviewed journals.

349868,When should we use corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia?,2021,"Here, we describe the longitudinal kinetics of the serological response in COVID-19 recovered patients over the period of 14 months. The antibody kinetics in a cohort of 200 recovered patients with 89 follow up samples at 2-4 visits reveal that RBD-specific antibodies decay over the period of 14 month following the onset of symptoms. The decay rate is associated with the robustness of the response thus, recovered patients that exhibit elevated antibody levels at the first visit, experience faster decay. We further explored the longitudinal kinetics differences between recovered patients and naive BNT162b2 vaccinees. We found a significantly faster decay in naive vaccinees compared to recovered patients suggesting that the serological memory following natural infection is more robust compared to vaccination. Our data highlights the differences between serological memory induced by natural infection vs. vaccination, facilitating the decision making in Israel regarding the 3rd dose vaccination.","Eyran, Tsuf; Vaisman-Mentesh, Anna; Dror, Yeal; Aizik, Ligal; Kigel, Aya; Rosenstein, Shai; Bahar, Yeal; Taussig, David; Tur-Kaspa, Ran; Kournos, Tatiana; Markovitch, Dana; Dicker, Dror; Wine, Yariv",,,133

The 'default' presentation of a polyneuropathy is a chronic, length-dependent, sensorimotor axonopathy. Recognizing deviations from this default, informed by the clinical features and investigations, can help identify the cause of a neuropathy in most cases. For inflammatory causes, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, there are effective immunomodulatory treatments. For other neuropathies, management consists of supportive care and treatment of the underlying cause, to prevent or limit progression.","Ginsberg, Lionel",Medicine (Abingdon),,133
350190,Lung Ultrasonography for the Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia in the Emergency Department,2020,"Rationale: The spreading of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging global threat. Optimal treatment for severe COVID-19 pneumonia is extremely urgent. We conducted this study to evaluate the safety, feasibility and effect of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) intervention in the treatment of patients with severe or critically severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: In this retrospective study, 43 patients with severe or critically severe COVID-19 pneumonia were included and divided into conserved intervention group (C-I group) and advanced intervention group (A-I group) according to the initiation time of PR intervention. The PR intervention includes education, respiratory rehabilitation, physical training, psychological counseling and nutrition management. Oxygenation Index (OI), blood d-dimer level, lymphocyte count and other laboratory findings were recorded. Results: The median age was 54 years (range 21 to 75 years);11 (25.6%) were 65 or older. 24 (55.8%) were male. All patients safely finished a certain course of pulmonary rehabilitation. The OI could increase to moderate level (&gt;300mmHg) during ICU treatment, and the A-I group showed a faster trend. The time of OI increased to moderate level was significantly shorter than that in C-I group (p=0.02). Lymphocytopenia occurred in 35 patients. The time of lymphocytopenia recovery was shorter in A-I group than that in C-I group. 25 patients had elevated blood d-dimer level during ICU stay. Only one DVT case was found in C-I group, no significant differences were found. Discussion: Despite most of the patients with COVID-19 were thought to have a favorable prognosis, older patients and those with chronic underlying conditions may quickly develop severe pneumonia and progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multi-organ failure. An optimal treatment for severe or critically severe COVID-19 pneumonia is in urgent need. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that adopts the PR intervention into the treatment of severe or critically severe COVID-19 pneumonia. With good safety and feasibility, pulmonary rehabilitation intervention can bring benefits in the treatment. The novel pandemic brought the dilemma that most of the countries are facing now. The high contagiousness of COVID-19, extreme shortage of medical staffs and dangerous lack of medical equipment together brought great challenge to the medical system. With the whole devotion of our medical staffs and the whole country, we have now successfully restrained the epidemic in China. Hereby we urgently share our experience and hope it would be of some help to the medical staffs worldwide.","Huang, X.; Jina, L.; Qingwu, Q.; Jia, H.; Xiangyu, C.; Bo, Y.; Chenfang, W.; Jun, H.; Kang, H.; Jianlei, L.; Xiang, F.; Zhiguo, Z.; Yan, C.; Chen, C.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,133

However, virtual encounters often face challenges in the care of patients in high-risk categories such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. In this study, we explore the patient's satisfaction and the practical effects of a newly established telemedicine program on CKD patients' care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a prior version of an online patient care platform established in 2017, we developed a customized and improved online telemedicine program designed to specifically address the challenges emerging from the pandemic. This included an online, smart phone-based strategy for triage and medical care delivery and psychological support. We invited a total of 278 CKD patients to join the new platform during the pandemic. The subjects in group A were patients utilizing our old online CKD system and were historical users registered at least 3 months before the pandemic. A pilot survey interrogating medical and psychological conditions was conducted. Feedback on the program as well as a psychological assessment were collected after 1 month. In total, 181 patients showed active responses to the program, with 289 person-time medical consultations occurring during the study. The virtual care program provided a rapid triage for 17% (30 out of 181) patients, with timely referral to in-patient medical encounters for their worsening medical conditions or severe psychological problems. Nearly all patients (97.4%) believed the program was helpful. The number of symptoms (OR 1.309, 95%CI 1.113-1.541; P = 0.001) and being enrolled during the pandemic (OR 3.939, 95% CI 1.174-13.221; P = 0.026) were associated with high stress. During the follow-up, the high-stress CKD group at baseline showed a significant decrease in avoidance score (6.9 ± 4.7 vs. 9.8 ± 1.9, P = 0.015). In conclusion, during the pandemic, we established an online telemedicine care program for CKD patients that provides a rapid triage function, effective CKD disease management, and potentially essential psychological support.","Zhao, Bingbin; Zhang, Lei; Ji, Peili; Lin, Jianfeng; Han, Jianfang; Li, Jiaying; Zhou, Zijuan; Wang, Haiyun; Qiu, Ling; Hong, Xia; Williams, Winfred; Chen, Limeng",Front Med (Lausanne),,133

DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: From April 23 to 27, 2020, an online survey was completed by 1,600 community-dwelling older adults in Japan. METHODS: We assessed the frailty status using the Kihon checklist, and other demographics and asked questions regarding PA at two time points: January and April 2020. We defined the total PA time (minutes) per week based on activity frequency and time. RESULTS: The study participants’ mean age, proportion of women, and prevalence of frailty were 74.0±5.6 years, 50% (n=800), and 24.3% (n=388), respectively. We found a significant decrease in total PA time in April 2020 (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 180 [0 to 420]) when compared to January 2020 (median [IQR], 245 [90 to 480]) (P&lt;0.001). We also performed a subgroup analysis according to the frailty category;total PA time significantly decreased in April 2020 when compared to January 2020 for all frailty categories (P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the total PA time in April 2020 significantly decreased compared to that in January 2020 in older adults.

355885,The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in the pathogenesis of COVID-19: the villain or the hero?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the largest global event in recent times, with millions of infected people and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Colombia has also been affected by the pandemic, including by the cancellation of medically necessary surgical procedures that were categorized as nonessential. The objective of this study was to show the results of the program implemented in two institutions in Bogotá, Colombia, in April 2020 to support the performance of elective essential and nonessential low- and medium-complexity orthopedic surgeries during the mitigation phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, which involved a presurgical clinical protocol without serological or molecular testing. METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational, retrospective, descriptive study of a cohort of patients who underwent elective orthopedic surgery at two institutions in the city of Bogota, Colombia, in April 2020. We implemented a preoperative clinical protocol that did not involve serological or molecular tests; the protocol consisted of a physical examination, a survey of symptoms and contact with confirmed or suspected cases, and presurgical isolation. We recorded the types of surgeries, the patients' scores on the medically necessary, time-sensitive (MeNTs) scale, the presence of signs, symptoms, and mortality associated with COVID-19 developed after the operation. RESULTS: A total of 179 patients underwent orthopedic surgery. The average age was 47 years (Shapiro-Wilk, P = 0.021), and the range was between 18 and 81 years. There was a female predominance (61.5%). With regard to the types of surgeries, 86 (48%) were knee operations, 42 (23.5%) were hand surgeries, 34 (19%) were shoulder surgeries, and 17 (9.5%) were foot and ankle surgeries. The average MeNTs score was 44.6 points. During the 2 weeks after surgery, four patients were suspected of having COVID-19 because they developed at least two symptoms associated with the disease. The incidence of COVID-19 in the postoperative period was 2.3%. Two (1.1%) of these four patients visited an emergency department where RT-PCR tests were performed, and they tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). No patients died or were hospitalized for symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Through the implementation of a presurgical clinical protocol consisting of a physical examination; a clinical survey inquiring about signs, symptoms, and epidemiological contact with suspected or confirmed cases; and presurgical isolation but not involving the performance of molecular or serological diagnostic tests, positive results were obtained with regard to the performance of low- and medium-complexity elective orthopedic surgeries in an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The absence of pharmacological interventions has pushed governments to apply different sets of old, non-pharmacological interventions, which are, though temporary, helpful to prevent further pandemic propagation. In the context of COVID-19, research confirms that quarantine is useful, mainly if applied early and if combined with other public health measures. However, the efficacy of quarantine and isolation is limited in many ways, ranging from legal issues and suspension of economic activities to mental health considerations. This chapter is an exploration of (i) epidemiological impact of isolation and quarantine; (ii) emotional impact of isolation and quarantine; and (iii) the possible effect of culture on quarantine experience.","Mojtabavi, Helia; Javidi, Nasirudin; Naviaux, Anne-Frédérique; Janne, Pascal; Gourdin, Maximilien; Mohammadpour, Mahsa; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,,133

365068,The Use of Captopril-Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor for Cystinuria During COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemics is posing unprecedented challenges and threats to patients and healthcare systems worldwide. Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general. ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in chronic and acute disease. Also importantly, prolonged ICU stays are reported to be required for COVID-19 patients stabilization, and longer ICU stay may per se directly worsen or cause malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which may lead to disability, poor quality of life and additional morbidity. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition should therefore be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients. In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) aims at providing concise guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients by proposing 10 practical recommendations. The practical guidance is focused to those in the ICU setting or in the presence of older age and polymorbidity, which are independently associated with malnutrition and its negative impact on patient survival.","Barazzoni, Rocco; Bischoff, Stephan C; Breda, Joao; Wickramasinghe, Kremlin; Krznaric, Zeljko; Nitzan, Dorit; Pirlich, Matthias; Singer, Pierre",Clin Nutr,,133

Drawing on data obtained from semi-structured interviews (N = 6) and a visual content analysis of the businesses' social media promotion in Instagram (N = 638), results show the performance of bakeries during pandemic times, where a change in production and consumption behaviors is observed and takeaway and delivery helped them to survive. In particular, their social media promotion in Instagram also revealed how bakeries have managed this difficult situation and kept a close relationship with customers, standing up as a symbol of resilience against the odds and contributing to preserve customers' awareness on food and health, and the city's identity, through digital branding strategies that communicate messages around bread and pastry foods (the product), the shop and the workshop (the place), and both the employees and the customers (the people).","Fusté-Forné, Francesc; Filimon, Nela",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,133

As such, we aimed to assess the effect on STEMI admissions and outcomes in Portuguese centers. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, observational, retrospective study including all patients admitted to our hospital due to STEMI between the date of the first SARS-CoV-2 case diagnosed in Portugal and the end of the state of emergency (March and April 2020). Patient characteristics and outcomes were assessed and compared with the same period of 2019. RESULTS: A total of 104 STEMI patients were assessed, 55 in 2019 and 49 in 2020 (-11%). There were no significant differences between groups regarding age (62±12 vs. 65±14 years, p=0.308), gender (84.8% vs. 77.6% males, p=0.295) or comorbidities. In the 2020 group, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of patients transported to the hospital in pre-hospital emergency medical transportation (38.2% vs. 20.4%, p=0.038), an increase in system delay (49 [30-110.25] vs. 140 [90-180] minutes, p=0.019), a higher Killip-Kimball class, with a decrease in class I (74.5% vs. 51%) and an increase in class III (1.8% vs. 8.2%) and IV (5.5% vs. 18.4%) (p=0.038), a greater incidence of vasoactive support (3.7% vs. 26.5%, p=0.001), invasive mechanic ventilation usage (3.6% vs. 14.3%, p=0.056), and an increase in severe left ventricular dysfunction at hospital discharge (3.6% vs. 16.3%, p=0.03). In-hospital mortality was 14.3% in the 2020 group and 7.3% in the 2019 group p=0.200). CONCLUSION: Despite a lack of significant variation in the absolute number of STEMI admissions, there was an increase in STEMI clinical severity and significantly worse outcomes during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. An increase in system delay, impaired pre-hospital care and patient fear of in-hospital infection can partially justify these results and should be the target of future actions in further waves of the pandemic.","Azul Freitas, André; Baptista, Rui; Gonçalves, Valdirene; Ferreira, Cátia; Milner, James; Lourenço, Carolina; Costa, Susana; Franco, Fátima; Monteiro, Sílvia; Gonçalves, Francisco; Gonçalves, Lino",Rev. port. cardiol,,133

374329,Tofacitinib use in adults with chronic inflammatory disease during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: What is known so far?,2021,"Coronaviruses have caused multiple epidemics in the past two decades, in addition to the current COVID-19 pandemic that is severely damaging global health and the economy. Coronaviruses employ between 20 and 30 proteins to carry out their viral replication cycle, including infection, immune evasion, and replication. Among these, nonstructural protein 16 (Nsp16), a 2'-O-methyltransferase, plays an essential role in immune evasion. Nsp16 achieves this by mimicking its human homolog, CMTr1, which methylates mRNA to enhance translation efficiency and distinguish self from other. Unlike human CMTr1, Nsp16 requires a binding partner, Nsp10, to activate its enzymatic activity. The requirement of this binding partner presents two questions that we investigate in this manuscript. First, how does Nsp10 activate Nsp16? Although experimentally derived structures of the active Nsp16/Nsp10 complex exist, structures of inactive, monomeric Nsp16 have yet to be solved. Therefore, it is unclear how Nsp10 activates Nsp16. Using over 1 ms of molecular dynamics simulations of both Nsp16 and its complex with Nsp10, we investigate how the presence of Nsp10 shifts Nsp16's conformational ensemble to activate it. Second, guided by this activation mechanism and Markov state models, we investigate whether Nsp16 adopts inactive structures with cryptic pockets that, if targeted with a small molecule, could inhibit Nsp16 by stabilizing its inactive state. After identifying such a pocket in SARS-CoV2 Nsp16, we show that this cryptic pocket also opens in SARS-CoV1 and MERS but not in human CMTr1. Therefore, it may be possible to develop pan-coronavirus antivirals that target this cryptic pocket.","Vithani, Neha; Ward, Michael D; Zimmerman, Maxwell I; Novak, Borna; Borowsky, Jonathan H; Singh, Sukrit; Bowman, Gregory R",Biophys. j,,133
374588,Interleukin-6: obstacles to targeting a complex cytokine in critical illness,2021,"Background: Vaccine hesitancy can limit the benefits of available vaccines in halting the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Previously published studies paid little attention to Arab countries, which has a population of over 440 million. In this study, we present the results of the first large-scale multinational study that measures vaccine hesitancy among Arab-speaking subjects. Methods: An online survey in Arabic was conducted from 14 January 2021 to 29 January 2021. It consisted of 17 questions capturing demographic data, acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine, attitudes toward the need for COVID-19 vaccination and associated health policies, and reasons for vaccination hesitancy. R software v.4.0.2 was used for data analysis and visualization. Results: The survey recruited 36,220 eligible participants (61.1% males, 38.9% females, mean age 32.6 ± 10.8 years) from all the 23 Arab countries and territories (83.4%) and 122 other countries (16.6%). Our analysis shows a significant rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabs in and outside the Arab region (83% and 81%, respectively). The most cited reasons for hesitancy are concerns about side effects and distrust in health care policies, vaccine expedited production, published studies and vaccine producing companies. We also found that female participants, those who are 30-59 years old, those with no chronic diseases, those with lower level of academic education, and those who do not know the type of vaccine authorized in their countries are more hesitant to receive COVID-19 vaccination. On the other hand, participants who regularly receive the influenza vaccine, health care workers, and those from countries with higher rates of COVID-19 infections showed more vaccination willingness. Interactive representation of our results is posted on our project website at https://mainapp.shinyapps.io/CVHAA. Conclusions: Our results show higher vaccine hesitancy and refusal among Arab subjects, related mainly to distrust and concerns about side effects. Health authorities and Arab scientific community have to transparently address these concerns to improve vaccine acceptance. Funding: This study received no funding.","Qunaibi, Eyad A; Helmy, Mohamed; Basheti, Iman; Sultan, Iyad",eLife (Cambridge),,133

We investigated safety and immunogenicity of the BNT162B2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in 34 SOT young adults as compared to 36 healthy controls (HC). Methodsimmunogenicity was measured through the analysis of anti SARS-CoV2 IgG Antibodies and antigen specific CD4 T cells (CD40L+), detected by flow cytometry before vaccination, 21 days after priming (T21), 7 days after booster dose (T28) and 2-4 months after priming (T120). Baseline T and B cell immune phenotype was deeply investigated. The safety profile was investigated by close monitoring and self-reported diary. ResultsAnti-S and anti-Trimeric Ab responses were significantly lower in SOT vs HC at T21 (p<0.0001) and at T28 (p<0.0001). Ten out of 34 SOT (29%) at T28 and 3 out of 33 (9%) at T120 had undetectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 T cells showed lower CD40L expression after in vitro stimulation in SOT compared to HC. Lower frequencies of memory B cells were found in patients not responding to vaccination. Lack of seroconversion was higher in patients treated with mycophenolate (p=0.0005). The vaccination was safe and well tolerated. Only short-term adverse events, were reported and no hospitalization or graft rejection were observed after vaccinations. ConclusionsThese data show that SOT have a suboptimal immune response following mRNA vaccinations as compared to HC. Alternative strategies should be investigated to improve the immunization against SARS-CoV-2 in these patients.","Cotugno, Nicola; Pighi, Chiara; Morrocchi, Elena; Ruggiero, Alessandra; Amodio, Donato; Medri, Chiara; Colagrossi, Luna; Cesare, Silvia Di; Santilli, Veronica; Manno, Emma Concetta; Zangari, Paola; Giancotta, Carmela; Bernardi, Stefania; Nicolosi, Luciana; Atti, Marta Ciofi degli; Raponi, Massimiliano; Zaffina, Salvatore; Alfieri, Sara; Kirk, Richard; Perno, Carlo Federico; Rossi, Paolo; Team, - Convers Study; Amodeo, Antonio; Palma, Paolo",,,133

On 15th of March, this disease has been classified by the World Health Organization as a pandemic and a global public health emergency. Objective: The study's aim was to evaluate the knowledge and behavior toward the virus among professional students of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Methodology: A cross-sectional study done on 753 students which were invited to complete a Google document using a 20-item electronic questionnaire that was design to gauge knowledge and attitude toward COVID-19. The study was conducted from February 20 to March 18, 2020 in Alkharj and Riyadh region. Results: The predominant sex is male (73%), the common age is &lt;25 years old, more medical students were involved in the study than any other specialty and the predominant educational degree of the participants was bachelors. The awareness of mode of transmission of novel coronavirus infection is less in business administration participants compare to others and is highly significant (P ˂ 0.001). Most of the participants (588 [98%]) were aware of coronavirus but only 302 (50%) of respondents are aware of COVID-19 which is highly significant (P ˂ 0.001). Conclusion: The results are mostly uniform among different professional students with the exception of some knowledge-related questions. The Internet was the main source of information, so there is a need to create more awareness about COVID-19 through social media.","Sharanesha, Rajashekhara Bader Aljuai Alfaifi Tariq Shukr Abdulelah Bamuqadm Mohammed Abdulmalik Alhoti",Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences,,133

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study using the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) database in Korea. The study population was defined as patients who visited all 402 EDs with medical conditions other than injuries between January 27 and May 31, 2020 (after-COVID) and for the corresponding time period in 2019 (before-COVID). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The main exposure was the COVID-19 outbreak, and the interaction variable was county per capita income tax. We calculated the risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality rates by COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the difference-in-difference of risk-adjusted rates between the before-COVID and after-COVID groups according to the county income tax using a multilevel linear regression model with the interaction term. RESULTS: A total of 11,662,167 patients (6,765,717 in before-COVID and 4,896,450 in after-COVID) were included in the study with a 1.6% crude in-hospital mortality rate. The risk-adjusted mortality rate in the after-COVID group was higher than that in the before-COVID group (1.82% vs. 1.50%, difference: 0.31% [0.30 to 0.33]; adjusted odds ratio: 1.22 [1.18 to 1.25]). The excess in-hospital mortality rate of the after-COVID in the lowest quartile group of county income tax was significantly higher than that in the highest quartile group (difference-in-difference: 0.18% (0.14 to 0.23); P-for-interaction: < 0.01).

This increased vulnerability makes it important to be innovative in opportunities for prevention in the PSP community. After reviewing available resources aimed at helping young people affected by a parental OSI, the authors uncovered a gap in prevention and intervention programs accessible to all Canadian PSP families. A new virtual six-week program offered to Canadian young people in military and PSP families affected by an OSI creates potential for developing resilience. The online platform opens access to young people who may be isolated from joining a traditional face-to-face mental health support program with peers. The virtual program aims to empower young people in their knowledge of mental health and enable them to learn about the complex nature of parental OSIs, such as posttraumatic stress disorder. More research on this program is needed to ensure interventions created for this target population are effective in the Canadian context and meet the unique needs of PSP-connected young people. © 2021 Izvestiya of Saratov University.

Its causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, enters human cells through the physical interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein and the human cell receptor ACE2. Here, we provide a novel way in understanding coronavirus spike proteins, connecting their nanomechanical features - specifically its vibrational spectrum and quantitative measures of mobility - with virus lethality and infection rate. The key result of our work is that both, the overall flexibility of upward RBD and the mobility ratio of RBDs in different conformations, represent two significant factors that show a positive scaling with virus lethality and an inverse correlation with the infection rate. Our analysis shows that epidemiological virus properties can be linked directly to pure nanomechanical, vibrational aspects, offering an alternative way of screening new viruses and mutations, and potentially exploring novel ways to prevent infections from occurring.","Hu, Yiwen; Buehler, Markus J",,,133

It consists of compartments corresponding to susceptible, vaccinated susceptible, infectious, vaccinated infectious, active, and dead populations with various vaccine efficacies and vaccination deployment rates. Abstract We simulate different scenarios and initial conditions, and we find that the abundance and higher rate of deployment of low efficacy vaccines would lower the cumulative number of deaths in comparison to slower deployment of high efficacy vaccines. However, the latter can lower the number of active cases and achieve faster and higher herd immunity. We also forecast that, at the same daily deployment rate, the earlier introduction of vaccination schemes with lower efficacy would also lower the number of deaths with respect to a delayed introduction of high efficacy vaccines, which can however, still achieve lower numbers of infections and better herd immunity.","Deeb, Omar El; Jalloul, Maya",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01488v1.pdf,133

We analyzed clinical data of 2017 COVID-19 cases reported in the Dubai health authority and developed predictive models to predict the patient's length of hospital stay and risk of death. A decision tree (DT) model to predict COVID-19 length of stay was developed based on patient clinical information. The model showed very good performance with a coefficient of determination R 2 of 49.8% and a median absolute deviation of 2.85 days. Furthermore, another DT-based model was constructed to predict COVID-19 risk of death. The model showed excellent performance with sensitivity and specificity of 96.5 and 87.8%, respectively, and overall prediction accuracy of 96%. Further validation using unsupervised learning methods showed similar separation patterns, and a receiver operator characteristic approach suggested stable and robust DT model performance. The results show that a high risk of death of 78.2% is indicated for intubated COVID-19 patients who have not used anticoagulant medications. Fortunately, intubated patients who are using anticoagulant and dexamethasone medications with an international normalized ratio of &lt;1.69 have zero risk of death from COVID-19. In conclusion, we constructed artificial intelligence-based models to accurately predict the length of hospital stay and risk of death in COVID-19 cases. These smart models will arm physicians on the front line to enhance management strategies to save lives.","Mahboub, B.; Bataineh, M. T.

425036,A smooth transition,2021,"BACKGROUND: To describe the characteristics of clinical manifestations of children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in Chongqing. METHODS: All 25 children with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RNA-PCR) were admitted from the 4 designated treatment hospitals of 2019-nCoV in Chongqing from January 19 to March 12, 2020. Clinical data and epidemiological history of these patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The diagnosis was confirmed through RNA-PCR testing. Among the 25 cases, 14 were males and 11 were females. The median age was 11.0 (6.3-14.5) years (range 0.6-17.0 years). All children were related to a family cluster outbreak, and 7 children (28%) with a travel or residence history in Hubei Province. These patients could be categorized into different clinical types, including 8 (32%) asymptomatic, 4 (16%) very mild cases and 13 (52%) common cases. No severe or critical cases were identified. The most common symptoms were cough (13 cases, 52%) and fever (6 cases, 24%). The duration time of clinical symptoms was 13.0 (8.0-25.0) days. In the 25 cases, on admission, 21 cases (84%) had normal white blood cell counts, while only 2 cases (8%) more than 10 × 10/L and 2 cases (8%) less than 4 × 10/L, respectively; 22 cases(88%) had normal CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 3 cases(8%) this increased mildly; 23 cases had normal CD8+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 2 cases (8%) CD8+ T lymphocyte counts were mildly increased as well. All Lymphocyte counts were normal. There were no statistical differences of lab results between the groups of asymptomatic cases, mild cases and common cases. There were only 13 cases with abnormal CT imaging, most of which were located in the subpleural area of the bottom of the lung. All patients were treated with interferon, 6 cases combined with Ribavirin, and 12 cases combined with lopinavir or ritonavir. The days from onset to RNA turning negative was 15.20 ± 6.54 days. There was no significant difference of RNA turning negative between the groups of interferon, interferon plus ribavirin and interferon plus lopinavir or ritonavir treatment. All the cases recovered and were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The morbidity of 2019-nCoV infection in children is lower than in adults and the clinical manifestations and inflammatory biomarkers in children are nonspecific and milder than that in adults. RNA-PCR test is still the most reliable diagnostic method, especially for asymptomatic patients.","Bai, Ke; Liu, Wenjun; Liu, Chengjun; Fu, Yueqiang; Hu, Jun; Qin, Yanran; Zhang, Qiaoying; Chen, Hongyan; Xu, Feng; Li, Changda",Pediatr. infect. dis. j,,133

This study examines the acoustic attenuation caused by different face masks, including medical, cloth, and transparent masks, using a head-shaped loudspeaker and a live human talker. The results suggest that all masks attenuate frequencies above 1 kHz, that attenuation is greatest in front of the talker, and that there is substantial variation between mask types, especially cloth masks with different materials and weaves.

Due to the scarcity of COVID-19 testing kits, especially in developing countries, there is a crucial need to rely on alternative diagnosis methods. Deep learning architectures built on image modalities can speed up the COVID-19 pneumonia classification from other types of pneumonia. The transfer learning approach is better suited to automatically detect COVID-19 cases due to the limited availability of medical images. This paper introduces an Optimized Transfer Learning-based Approach for Automatic Detection of COVID-19 (OTLD-COVID-19) that applies an optimization algorithm to twelve CNN architectures to diagnose COVID-19 cases using chest x-ray images. The OTLD-COVID-19 approach adapts Manta-Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) algorithm to optimize the network hyperparameters’ values of the CNN architectures to improve their classification performance. The proposed dataset is collected from eight different public datasets to classify 4-class cases (COVID-19, pneumonia bacterial, pneumonia viral, and normal).

In this study we undertook a meta-analysis to estimate the global and regional seroprevalence rates in humans of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and to assess whether seroprevalence is associated with geographical, climatic and/or sociodemographic factors. METHODS: We systematically reviewed PubMed, Scopus, Embase, medRxiv and bioRxiv databases for preprints or peer-reviewed articles (up to 14 August 2020). Study eligibility criteria were population-based studies describing the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG and/or IgM) serum antibodies. Participants were people from different socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds (from the general population), whose prior COVID-19 status was unknown and who were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies. We used a random-effects model to estimate pooled seroprevalence, and then extrapolated the findings to the global population (for 2020). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses explored potential sources of heterogeneity in the data, and relationships between seroprevalence and sociodemographic, geographical and/or climatic factors. RESULTS: In total, 47 studies involving 399 265 people from 23 countries met the inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity (I2 = 99.4%, p < 0.001) was seen among studies; SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the general population varied from 0.37% to 22.1%, with a pooled estimate of 3.38% (95%CI 3.05-3.72%; 15 879/399 265). On a regional level, seroprevalence varied from 1.45% (0.95-1.94%, South America) to 5.27% (3.97-6.57%, Northern Europe), although some variation appeared to relate to the serological assay used. The findings suggested an association of seroprevalence with income levels, human development indices, geographic latitudes and/or climate. Extrapolating to the 2020 world population, we estimated that 263.5 million individuals had been exposed or infected at the time of this study. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence varied markedly among geographic regions, as might be expected early in a pandemic. Longitudinal surveys to continually monitor seroprevalence around the globe will be critical to support prevention and control efforts, and might indicate levels of endemic stability or instability in particular countries and regions.","Rostami, Ali; Sepidarkish, Mahdi; Leeflang, Mariska M G; Riahi, Seyed Mohammad; Nourollahpour Shiadeh, Malihe; Esfandyari, Sahar; Mokdad, Ali H; Hotez, Peter J; Gasser, Robin B",Clin. microbiol. infect,,133

We evaluated student perspectives on the benefits, drawbacks, and lessons learned from a migrant health field course in the U.S.–Mexico border region. We analyzed qualitative data from reflexive diary-writing assignments and post-course evaluations from graduate and undergraduate students (N = 12). Students highlighted personal growth and reflexivity, professional development opportunities, and benefits and drawbacks of the immersive course design as key themes. Tri-national learning across Canada, Mexico and the U.S., and an interdisciplinary, cross-cultural learning model allowed for deeper understandings of globally relevant and politically and socially complex issues through community engagement and ‘real-world’ approaches. Students described benefits of reflexive learning, bridging classroom-based learning with field experiences, and learning about community-engaged research in advancing im/migrant justice, though acknowledged challenges of intensive course design. Narratives highlighted unique needs in navigating challenges inherent in reflexive learning on sensitive topics, such as structural inequities faced by asylum seekers. This evaluation provides unique empirical evidence to inform future experiential learning opportunities rooted in equity-oriented approaches, which are crucial for advancing hands-on learning regarding global issues.

COVID-19 is highly infectious and is characterized by an acute respiratory illness that varies from mild flu-like symptoms to the life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). As such, there is an urgent need for the development of new therapeutic strategies, which combat the high mortality in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Glucocorticoids are a frontline treatment for a diverse range of inflammatory diseases. Due to their immunosuppressive functions, the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of COVID-19 patients was initially regarded with caution. However, recent studies concluded that the initiation of systemic glucocorticoids in patients suffering from severe and critical COVID-19 is associated with lower mortality. Herein we review the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids and discuss emerging issues in their clinical use in the context of COVID-19.","Alexaki, Vasileia Ismini; Henneicke, Holger",Horm. metabol. res,,133

The government now finds itself in danger of a sovereign default. This article traces the roots of this debt crisis over the past decade, focusing particularly on the role of hydropower. A significant share of infrastructure lending to Laos has been through Chinese policy banks. We argue that over‐lending to dam projects focused on the domestic energy market has been at the core of Laos' debt situation. Through 2020 the Lao Government has undertaken a series of restructuring measures, including privatisation of state assets, engaging in debt renegotiations with China, and attempts to secure new short‐term credit.

There has been little scrutiny of alcohol use behaviors resulting in hospital visits, which is essential to guide pandemic public policy. We aimed to determine whether COVID-19 peak restrictions were associated with increased hospital visits for alcohol use or withdrawal. Secondary objectives were to describe differences based on age, sex, and race, and to examine alcohol-related complication incidence. DESIGN: Multi-center, retrospective, pre-post study. SETTING: New York City health system with five participating hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Adult Emergency Department encounters for alcohol use, alcoholic gastritis or pancreatitis or hepatitis, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, withdrawal seizure, or delirium tremens. MEASUREMENTS: Age, sex, race, site, encounter diagnosis. Encounters were compared between 2019 and 2020, for March 1 through May 31. FINDINGS: There were 2,790 alcohol-related visits during the 2019 study period and 1,793 in 2020, with a decrease in total hospital visits. Of 4,583 alcohol-related visits, median age was 47 years, with 22.1% females. In 2020, there was an increase in percentage of visits for alcohol withdrawal (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.07-1.67) and withdrawal with complications (AOR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.14-1.72), and a decline in percentage of hospital visits for alcohol use (AOR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.59-0.85) and use with complications (AOR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.58-0.88). It is unknown whether use visit changes mirror declines in other chief complaints. The age groups 18-29 and 60-69 years were associated with increased visits for use and decreased visits for withdrawal, as were non-white race groups. Sex was not associated with alcohol-related visit changes despite male predominance. CONCLUSIONS: In New York City during the initial COVID-19 peak (1 March to 31 May 2020), hospital visits for alcohol withdrawal increased while those for alcohol use decreased.","Schimmel, Jonathan; Vargas-Torres, Carmen; Genes, Nicholas; Probst, Marc A; Manini, Alex F",Addiction,,133

435838,Mild ast elevation as an early sign of COVID-19 severity in a multicenter Madrid cohort,2021,"Tumor growth patterns differ depending on the individual tumor, leading to various patterns of genetic heterogeneity across tumors. Despite their importance, the population mutation properties of tumor evolution have not been well studied, especially in terms of overall genetic heterogeneity. The current study aims to examine factors in tumor evolution influencing overall genetic heterogeneity. Extensive simulations of the representative evolutionary patterns of various tumors were conducted in the current study to determine the overall genetic characteristics of tumor evolution. The variations in cell birth/death rates and angiogenesis duration were examined based on the simplest growth pattern of tumors with avascular growth, angiogenesis, and vascular growth. To examine the impact of evolutionary tree structure, three-step linear evolution and branching evolution were investigated based on various subpopulation initiation times. The population size during the initial growth phase and the duration of angiogenesis are important factors affecting overall genetic heterogeneity. Furthermore, the shape of the evolutionary tree is crucial for defining the genetic heterogeneity of the extant tumor cell population, indicating the importance of the initiation timing of subpopulations. Branching evolution results in slightly greater genetic heterogeneity in terms of allelic distribution than in terms of the number of variants. The results of the current study reveal that the pattern of tumor evolution is critical for defining tumor genetic heterogeneity. These population genetic approaches are important for understanding the properties of tumor cell populations.","Park, LeeYoung",Med Oncol,,133

People living with dementia have faced service curtailment, increased risk for COVID-19, as well as potential heightened deterioration. This study reports the experiences of people living with dementia and their family carers during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in England and the impact on them. METHODS: We recruited and remotely interviewed 30 people living with dementia in their own homes and 31 family carers, via video or telephone call in mid-2020. Data were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: People living with dementia often had a basic understanding of COVID-19 restrictions but could have difficulty translating this into personalised risk-appraisal of their own actions. Managing COVID-19 risks facing people living with dementia at home was largely done by family carers, exemplified by changes to living arrangements, which could strain or sustain caring relationships. Well-established familial caring relationships contributed to the wellbeing of the person living with dementia and their carer, as well as keeping to simple routines that included leaving the home for exercise and stimulation. People living with dementia reported some negative psychological and cognitive effects due to the imposed restrictions, such as increased apathy, irritability, or anxiety, which were fuelled by lack of social engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Structuring routine (remote) social interactions where possible could increase social engagement and improve wellbeing for people living with dementia, especially those with limited familial support in a post-COVID-19 context. As some care relationships had been restructured to manage COVID-19 risks, additional carer strain may emerge as a result of the impact on the independence of the person living with dementia and come to the attention of professionals in health and care services. People living with dementia and their carers highlighted the importance of maintaining or adapting routines which may be useful learning for professionals, although additional support may be necessary for those who are impacted by more severe or worsening symptoms of dementia.","Tuijt, Remco; Frost, Rachael; Wilcock, Jane; Robinson, Louise; Manthorpe, Jill; Rait, Greta; Walters, Kate",BMC Geriatr,,133
436353,The epidemiology and clinical information about COVID-19,2020,"There are several risk factors for worse outcomes in patients with coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19). Patients with hypertension appear to have a poor prognosis, but there is no direct evidence that hypertension increases the risk of new infection or adverse outcomes independent of age and other risk factors. There is also concern about use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors due to a key role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors in the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells. However, there is little evidence that use of RAS inhibitors increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection or worsens the course of COVID-19. Therefore, antihypertensive therapy with these agents should be continued. In addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome, patients with severe COVID-19 can develop myocardial injury and cytokine storm, resulting in heart failure, arteriovenous thrombosis, and kidney injury. Troponin, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, D-dimer, and serum creatinine are biomarkers for these complications and can be used to monitor patients with COVID-19 and for risk stratification. Other factors that need to be incorporated into patient management strategies during the pandemic include regular exercise to maintain good health status and monitoring of psychological well-being. For the ongoing management of patients with hypertension, telemedicine-based home blood pressure monitoring strategies can facilitate maintenance of good blood pressure control while social distancing is maintained. Overall, multidisciplinary management of COVID-19 based on a rapidly growing body of evidence will help ensure the best possible outcomes for patients, including those with risk factors such as hypertension.","Kario, Kazuomi; Morisawa, Yuji; Sukonthasarn, Apichard; Turana, Yuda; Chia, Yook-Chin; Park, Sungha; Wang, Tzung-Dau; Chen, Chen-Huan; Tay, Jam Chin; Li, Yan; Wang, Ji-Guang",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),,133

442062,Impact of Chronic Use of Antimalarials on SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Patients With Immune-Mediated Rheumatic Diseases: Protocol for a Multicentric Observational Cohort Study,2020,"IntroductionTo prevent infection during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, COPD patients were instructed to ‘shield’, resulting in restrictions to usual daily activities, potentially negating health benefits attained during pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) The aim of this study was to determine the impact of a shielding period on physical activity levels and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in COPD patients who completed a course of supervised PR before shielding in March 2020 MethodsCOPD patients who completed an 8-week PR course between January and March 2020 were enrolled into this single centre, observational cohort study Physical activity was measured using accelerometry (Actigraph wGT3X) and the Clinical Visit of Proactive Physical Activity in COPD (C-PPAC) instrument (that captures the domains of amount and difficulty of physical activity;Gimeno-Santos et al ERJ 2015) in the week preceding PR, the week following completion of PR and for a week 3 months following completion of PR during the shielding period (April to July 2020) Additionally, assessment of HRQoL (COPD Assessment Test [CAT] and Clinical COPD Questionnaire [CCQ]) and psychological wellbeing (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]) was undertaken ResultsIn ten COPD patients (FEV1: 55±23% predicted), a significant and clinically meaningful decrease in daily steps was shown from post-PR to shielding (4129±2245 versus 2508±1186 steps/day;p=0 030), as well as pre-PR to shielding (3681±2025 versus 2508±1186 steps/day;p=0 015) Likewise, there was a significant and clinically meaningful worsening in the C-PPAC score from post-PR to shielding (68±13 versus 59±13 points;p=0 060), but not pre-PR to shielding (61±11 versus 59±13 points;p=1 000) There were no statistically or clinically meaningful changes in HADS and CAT scores However, the worsening in CCQ scores from post-PR to shielding did exceed clinically meaningful margins (±0 4 points) for both functional (+0 5 points) and mental domains (+0 7 points) ConclusionsIn COPD, the shielding period had a negative impact on physical activity levels, evidenced by reduced daily steps compared to not only post-PR, but also pre-PR This decline below baseline values could have led to further physical deconditioning, potentially reversing some of the benefits gained during PR and worsening long term disease-related outcomes","Hume, E.; Armstrong, M.; Manifield, J.; Vogiatzis, I.",Thorax,,133
442596,[Is conjunctival congestion in patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus definitely related to the novel coronavirus],2020,"Proline-glycine-proline (PGP) and its acetylated form (Ac-PGP) are neutrophil chemoattractants generated by collagen degradation, and they have been shown to play a role in chronic inflammatory disease. However, the mechanism for matrikine regulation in acute inflammation has not been well established. Here, we show that these peptides are actively transported from the lung by the oligopeptide transporter, PEPT2. Following intratracheal instillation of Ac-PGP in a mouse model, there was a rapid decline in concentration of the labeled peptide in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) over time and redistribution to extrapulmonary sites. In vitro knockdown of the PEPT2 transporter in airway epithelia or use of a competitive inhibitor of PEPT2, cefadroxil, significantly reduced uptake of Ac-PGP. Animals that received intratracheal Ac-PGP plus cefadroxil had higher levels of Ac-PGP in BAL and lung tissue. Utilizing an acute LPS-induced lung injury model, we demonstrate that PEPT2 blockade enhanced pulmonary Ac-PGP levels and lung inflammation. We further validated this effect using clinical samples from patients with acute lung injury in coculture with airway epithelia. This is the first study to our knowledge to determine the in vitro and in vivo significance of active matrikine transport as a mechanism of modulating acute inflammation and to demonstrate that it may serve as a potential therapeutic target.","Robison, Sarah W; Li, JinDong; Viera, Liliana; Blackburn, Jonathan P; Patel, Rakesh P; Blalock, J Edwin; Gaggar, Amit; Xu, Xin",JCI insight,,133

We aimed to evaluate renal complications of COVID-19 and their incidence using a systematic meta-analysis. DESIGN: Observational studies reporting renal complications in COVID-19 patients were sought from MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library from 2019 to June 2020. The nine-star Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate methodological quality. Incidence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. RESULTS: We included 22 observational cohort studies comprising of 17,391 COVID-19 patients. Quality scores of studies ranged from 4 to 6. The pooled prevalence of pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease was 5.2% (2.8-8.1) and 2.3% (1.8-2.8), respectively. The pooled incidence over follow-up of 2-28 days was 12.5% (10.1-15.0) for electrolyte disturbance (e.g. hyperkalaemia), 11.0% (7.4-15.1) for acute kidney injury (AKI) and 6.8% (1.0-17.0) for renal replacement therapy (RRT). In subgroup analyses, there was a higher incidence of AKI in US populations and groups with higher prevalence of pre-existing CKD. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent renal complications reported among hospitalized COVID-19 patients are electrolyte disturbance, AKI and RRT. Aggressive monitoring and management of these renal complications may help in the prediction of favourable outcomes.

One of them, proposed by Segreto and Deigin, assumes artificial chimeric construction of SARS-CoV-2 from a backbone of RaTG13-like CoV and receptor binding domain (RBD) of a pangolin MP789-like CoV, followed by serial cell or animal passage. Here we show that this hypothesis relies on incorrect or weak assumptions, and does not agree with the results of comparative genomics analysis. The genetic divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and both its proposed ancestors is too high to have accumulated in a lab, given the timeframe of several years. Furthermore, comparative analysis of S-protein gene sequences suggests that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 probably represents an ancestral non-recombinant variant. These and other arguments significantly weaken the hypothesis of a laboratory origin for SARS-CoV-2, while the hypothesis of a natural origin is consistent with all available genetic and experimental data.","Tyshkovskiy, Alexander; Panchin, Alexander Y",Bioessays,,133

This is a report on the PAART experience in a medium- and high-complexity hospital during the pandemic. The program was restructured, given the need to understand work situations from workers’ and managers’ reports and previous knowledge about hospital dynamics. These reports were retrieved by information and communication technologies. A total of 571 workers were included in the PAART, and 277 could be contacted. Work organization relocation and changes in the period resulted in disrupted services, modified work routines and teams, and directly affected the implementation of the PAART. This raised concerns about the contributions of activity ergonomics and work ergonomic analysis in unpredictable work context situations. Also, we asked about the possible outcomes of the PAART if observations and analyses of real work situations were maintained.

Evidence suggests advanced age is associated with worse outcomes. To date, no large data sets exist describing outcomes in older individuals, and risk factor identification is lacking. METHODS: Retrospective data were obtained from the 2015 Medicare 100% sample. Included in the analysis were those aged &#8805;65 y with a primary diagnosis of an NSTI (gas gangrene, necrotizing fasciitis, cutaneous gangrene, or Fournier's gangrene). Risk factors for in-hospital mortality and discharge disposition were examined. Continuous variables were assessed using central tendency, t-tests, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Categorical variables were assessed using the chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. RESULTS: 1427 patient records were reviewed. 59% of patients were male, and the overall mean age was 75.4±8.6 y. 1385 (97.0%) patients required emergency surgery for their NSTI diagnosis. The overall mortality was 5.3%. Several underlying comorbidities were associated with higher rates of mortality including cancer (OR: 3.50, P = 0.0009), liver disease (OR: 2.97, P = 0.03), and kidney disease (OR: 2.15, P = 0.01). While associated with high in-hospital mortality, these diagnoses were not associated with a difference in the rate of discharge to home compared with skilled nursing or rehab. Overall, patients discharged to skilled nursing facilities or rehab had higher rates of underlying comorbidities than patients who were discharged home (3 or more comorbid illness 84.3% versus 68.6%, P < 0.0001); however, no individual comorbid illness was associated with discharge location. CONCLUSIONS: In our Medicare data set, we identified several medical comorbidities that are associated with increased rates of in-hospital mortality. Patients with underlying cancers had the highest odds of increased mortality. The effect on outcomes of the potentially immunosuppressive cancer treatments in these patients is unknown. These data suggest that patients with underlying illnesses, especially cancer, kidney disease, or liver disease have higher mortalities and are more likely to be discharged to skilled nursing facilities or rehab. It is unclear why these illnesses were associated with these worse outcomes while others including diabetes and heart disease were not. These data suggest that these particular comorbid illnesses may have special prognostic implications, although further analysis is necessary to identify the causative factors.","McCarty, Adara R; Villarreal, Michael E; Tamer, Robert; Strassels, Scott A; Schubauer, Kathryn M; Paredes, Anghela Z; Santry, Heena; Wisler, Jon R",J Surg Res,,133

474813,A case of 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia with twice negative 2019-nCoV nucleic acid testing within 8 days,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, is an acute respiratory disease that has been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The sudden spike in the number of infections and high mortality rates have put immense pressure on the public healthcare systems. Hence, it is crucial to identify the key factors for mortality prediction to optimize patient treatment strategy. Different routine blood test results are widely available compared to other forms of data like X-rays, CT-scans, and ultrasounds for mortality prediction. This study proposes machine learning (ML) methods based on blood tests data to predict COVID-19 mortality risk. A powerful combination of five features: neutrophils, lymphocytes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and age helps to predict mortality with 96% accuracy. Various ML models (neural networks, logistic regression, XGBoost, random forests, SVM, and decision trees) have been trained and performance compared to determine the model that achieves consistently high accuracy across the days that span the disease. The best performing method using XGBoost feature importance and neural network classification, predicts with an accuracy of 90% as early as 16 days before the outcome. Robust testing with three cases based on days to outcome confirms the strong predictive performance and practicality of the proposed model.

475757,Turbulent Airflow Costume Compromises Occupational Safety and Infection Control: A Hospital Risk Management Case Report,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. The global number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has surpassed 28,285,700 with mortality that appears higher than for seasonal influenza. About 20% of COVID-19 patients have experienced cardiac involvement and myocardial infarction in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a worse prognosis. Furthermore, the widespread use of antiviral drugs can be linked to a worsening of heart function. Arrhythmias and hypertension have also been reported in patients with Covid-19. On the other hand, previous cardiac diseases are present in 30% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. There is uncertainty in the use of ace inhibitors and angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonists in the COVID-19 era. The mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 has been elucidated. It has been demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and it is required for host cell entry and subsequent viral replication. The effect of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is the downregulation of ACE2 that may contribute to the severity of lung pathologies as well as the cardiac function. ACE2, a homolog of ACE, is a monocarboxypeptidase that converts Ang II into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) that with its vasodilatory, antifibrotic, antihypertrophic effects counterbalances the negative effects of Ang II. On the other hand, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and AT1R blockers have been shown to upregulate the expression of ACE2. Based on the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2, the use of renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors was questioned although all scientific societies did not recommend discontinuation when clinically recommended. The BRACE CORONA, a phase 4, randomized study tested two strategies: temporarily stopping the ACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) for 30âdays versus continuing ACE inhibitors/ARBs in patients who were taking these medications chronically and were hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was also discussed. Therefore, the goal of this review is to summarize recent laboratory and clinical investigations concerning the use of ACEi and ARBs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The available data, based also on a randomized trial, suggest that ACEIs or ARBs, when clinically indicated, should be regularly used in the COVID-19 era.","Spaccarotella, Carmen; Mazzitelli, Maria; Migliarino, Serena; Curcio, Antonio; De Rosa, Salvatore; Torti, Carlo; Indolfi, Ciro",J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),,133
475758,Turbulent Airflow Costume Compromises Occupational Safety and Infection Control: A Hospital Risk Management Case Report,2021,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess if computed tomography (CT) radiomics can predict the severity and outcome of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. METHODS: This institutional ethical board-approved study included 92 patients (mean age, 59 ± 17 years; 57 men, 35 women) with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for COVID-19 infection who underwent noncontrast chest CT. Two radiologists evaluated all chest CT examinations and recorded opacity type, distribution, and extent of lobar involvement. Information on symptom duration before hospital admission, the period of hospital admission, presence of comorbid conditions, laboratory data, and outcomes (recovery or death) was obtained from the medical records. The entire lung volume was segmented on thin-section Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine images to derive whole-lung radiomics. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression with receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (AUC) as the output. RESULTS: Computed tomography radiomics (AUC, 0.99) outperformed clinical variables (AUC, 0.89) for prediction of the extent of pulmonary opacities related to COVID-19 pneumonia. Type of pulmonary opacities could be predicted with CT radiomics (AUC, 0.77) but not with clinical or laboratory data (AUC, <0.56; P > 0.05). Prediction of patient outcome with radiomics (AUC, 0.85) improved to an AUC of 0.90 with the addition of clinical variables (patient age and duration of presenting symptoms before admission). Among clinical variables, the combination of peripheral capillary oxygen saturation on hospital admission, duration of symptoms, platelet counts, and patient age provided an AUC of 0.81 for predicting patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Radiomics from noncontrast CT reliably predict disease severity (AUC, 0.99) and outcome (AUC, 0.85) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Homayounieh, Fatemeh; Babaei, Rosa; Karimi Mobin, Hadi; Arru, Chiara D; Sharifian, Maedeh; Mohseni, Iman; Zhang, Eric; Digumarthy, Subba R; Kalra, Mannudeep K",J Comput Assist Tomogr,,133

We previously described von willebrand factor (VWF) and their high molecular weight multimers (HMWMs) as potential trigger of microthrombosis. OBJECTIVES: Investigate VWF activity with collagen-binding assay and ADAMTS13 in COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Our study enrolled 77 hospitalized COVID-19 patients including 37 suffering from a non-critical form and 40 with critical form. Plasma levels of VWF collagen-binding ability (VWF:CB) and ADAMTS13 activity (ADAMTS13:Act) were measured in the first 48 hours following admission. VWF:CB was increased in critical (631% IQR [460-704]) patients compared to non-critical patients (259% [235-330], p < 0.005). VWF:CB was significantly associated (r = 0.564, p < 0.001) with HMWMs. Moreover, median ADAMTS13:Act was lower in critical (64.8 IU/dL IQR 50.0-77.7) than non-critical patients (85.0 IU/dL IQR 75.8-94.7, p < 0.001), even if no patients displayed majors deficits. VWF:Ag-to-ADAMTS13:Act ratio was highly associated with VWF:CB (r = 0.916, p < 0.001). Moreover, VWF:CB level was highly predictive of COVID-19 in-hospital mortality as shown by the ROC curve analysis (AUC = 0.92, p < 0.0001) in which we identified a VWF:CB cut-off of 446% as providing the best predictor sensitivity-specificity balance. We confirmed this cut-off thanks to a Kaplan-Meier estimator analysis (log-rank p < 0.001) and a Cox-proportional Hazard model (HR = 49.1, 95% CI 1.81-1328.2, p = 0.021) adjusted on, BMI, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer levels. CONCLUSION: VWF:CB levels could summarize both VWF increased levels and hyper-reactivity subsequent to ADAMTS13 overflow and, therefore, be a valuable and easy to perform clinical biomarker of microthrombosis and COVID-19 severity.","Philippe, Aurélien; Gendron, Nicolas; Bory, Olivier; Beauvais, Agathe; Mirault, Tristan; Planquette, Benjamin; Sanchez, Olivier; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Chocron, Richard; Smadja, David M",Angiogenesis,,133

MATERIAL AND METHODS: At the end of February 2020, we developed at the hospital a strategy to diagnose the SARS-CoV-2 infection consisting of complementing the realization of PCR tests at real time with a quick technique of lateral flow immunochromatography to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against the virus. We also developed a protocol to realize those diagnostic tests and considered an infection (current or past) a positive result in any of the above tests. We included 524 participants in the study (230 patients and 294 hospital staff), and divided them into hospital patients and Hemodialysis outpatients. Furthermore, we divided the hospital staff into healthcare and non-healthcare staff. The documented period was from March, 20th to April, 21st, 2020. RESULTS: 26 out of 230 patients tested positive in any of the diagnostic techniques (PCR, antibodies IgG, IgM) with a 11.30% prevalence. According to patients groups, we got a 14.38% prevalence in hospital patients vs. 5.95% in outpatients, with a significantly higher risk in admitted patients after adjustment for age and gender (OR=3,309, 95%CI: 1,154-9,495). 24 out of 294 hospital staff tested positive in any of the diagnostic techniques, with a 8.16% prevalence. According to the groups, we got a 8.91% prevalence in healthcare staff vs. 4.26% in non-healthcare staff. Thus, we do not see any statistically significant differences between hospital staff and patients as far as prevalence is concerned (P=0,391), (OR=2,200, 95%CI: 0,500-9,689). CONCLUSIONS: The result of the study was a quite low prevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in both patients and hospital staff, being the hospital patients' prevalence rate higher than the outpatients', and the healthcare staff higher than the non-healthcare's. Combining PCR tests (gold standard) with antibodies tests proved useful as a diagnostic strategy.","Moreno Borraz, Luis Antonio; Giménez López, Mercedes; Carrera Lasfuentes, Patricia; González Pérez, Emilio; Ortíz Domingo, Concepción; Bonafonte Marteles, José Luis; Vicente Gaspar, Carmen; Amorós de la Nieta, Francisco; Sastre Heres, Alejandro; García Forcada, Ángel Luis; Serrano Herrero, María Pilar; Fernández Doblado, Silvia; Espinosa Val, María Carmen; Fernández Adarve, María Mar; Narvión Carriquiri, Adriana; Arto Maza, Fernando; Barea Gil, Marta; Aznar Vázquez, Irene; Sisas Rubio, Raquel; González Tejedor, Raquel; Florentín Ostáriz, Evelyn; López Santed, Consuelo; Molina Morales, Ana Rosa; Parrilla Binué, Sara; Pérez Sans, Javier; García Mena, Mercedes; Moragrega Cardona, Belén; Luzón Alonso, Marta; Díaz Mora, Francisco; Gil Acebes, Juan Carlos; Rubio Morilla, Yolanda; Lou Lou, Rosa; Zabala Lahoz, Rosa Blanca; Coarasa Lirón de Robles, Ana",Rev. esp. geriatr. gerontol.

The most fundamental approach is to look into the structures of its RNA, in particular, the nucleotides and amino acids. This motivates our research on this topic. We study the occurrence structures of nitrogenous bases and amino acids. To this aim, we devise a structural metric which could measure the structure differences for bases or amino acids. By analyzing various SARS-CoV-2 samples, we calculate the distance matrices for nitrogenous bases and amino acids. Based on the distance matrices, we find the average distance matrices for them, respectively. Then we identify the relations of all the minimal distances between bases and amino acids. The results also show that different substructures would yield much more diversified distances between amino acids. In the end, we also conduct the comparison of our structural metric with other frequently used metrics, in particular, Hausdorff metrics.","Chen, Ray-Ming",J Bioinform Comput Biol,,133

Like any catastrophic event, the stress on hospitals to maintain a certain level of function is immense. Acute surgical pathologies cannot be prevented or curtailed; therefore, it is important to understand patterns and outcomes during catastrophes in order to optimize care and organize the health care system. METHODS: In a single urban tertiary care center, a retrospective study examined the first complete lockdown period of Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was compared to the same time period the previous year. RESULTS: During the pandemic, time to hospitalization was significantly decreased. There was also an overall reduction in surgical admissions yet with a higher percentage being hospitalized for further treatment (69.2% vs 23.5%). The patients admitted during this time had a higher APACHE-II score and Charlson comorbidity index score. During the pandemic, time to surgery was decreased, there were less laparoscopic procedures, and more RBC units were used per patient. There were no differences in overall complications, except when sub-analyzed for major complications (9.7% vs 6.3%). There was no significant difference in overall in-house mortality or morbidity.

Here, we applied integrated bioinformatics to identify potential key genes and cytokine pathways after RV infection in asthma, and analyzed changes in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor of SARS-COV-2. MATERIAL AND METHODS The gene expression profile dataset GSE149273 was downloaded from NCBI-GEO, which included 90 samples of non-infected, RVA, and RVC. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using t tests in the limma R package, and subsequently investigated by GO, KEGG, and DO analysis. Moreover, the expression of ACE2 and the proportion of immune cells were further analyzed to determine the effects of RV on cytokines. RESULTS A total of 555 DEGs of RVA and 421 of RVC were identified. There were 415 DEGs in RVA and RVC, of which 406 were upregulated and 9 were downregulated. The functional enrichment analysis showed that most DEGs were obviously enriched in cytokines, and were mainly enriched in ""influenza"" and ""hepatitis C, chronic"". In addition, the expression of ACE2 increased significantly and the proportion of immune cytokines significantly changed after RV infection. Our results suggest that RV can activate the cytokine pathway associated with COVID-19 by increasing ACE2. CONCLUSIONS The DEGs and related cytokine pathways after asthma RV infection identified using integrated bioinformatics in this study elucidate the potential link between RV and COVID-19.","Dai, Wenjuan; Cao, Dawei; Zhang, Wei; Wei, Yangyang; Ding, Daqing; Li, Bei; Gao, Yan; Zhao, Lixuan; Jiang, Yi; Kong, Xiaomei",Med Sci Monit,,133

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the psychological and mental impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers, the general population, and patients with higher COVID-19 risk published between 1 Nov 2019 to 25 May 2020. We conducted literature research using Embase, PubMed, Google scholar and WHO COVID-19 databases. Among the initial search of 9207 studies, 62 studies with 162,639 participants from 17 countries were included in the review. The pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression was 33% (95% confidence interval: 28%-38%) and 28% (23%-32%), respectively. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was the highest among patients with pre-existing conditions and COVID-19 infection (56% [39%-73%] and 55% [48%-62%]), and it was similar between healthcare workers and the general public. Studies from China, Italy, Turkey, Spain and Iran reported higher-than-pooled prevalence among healthcare workers and the general public. Common risk factors included being women, being nurses, having lower socioeconomic status, having high risks of contracting COVID-19, and social isolation. Protective factors included having sufficient medical resources, up-to-date and accurate information, and taking precautionary measures. In conclusion, psychological interventions targeting high-risk populations with heavy psychological distress are in urgent need.","Luo, Min; Guo, Lixia; Yu, Mingzhou; Jiang, Wenying; Wang, Haiyan",Psychiatry Res,,133

505784,Olanexidine gluconate formulations as environmental disinfectants for enveloped viruses infection control,2021,"Research on the impact of the environment on COVID-19 diffusion lacks a full-comprehensive perspective, and neglecting the multiplicity of the human-environment system can lead to misleading conclusions. We attempted to reveal all pre-existing environmental-to-human and human-to-human determinants that influence the transmission of COVID-19. As such, We estimated the daily case incidence ratios (CIR) of COVID-19 for prefectures across mainland China, and used a mixed-effects mixed-distribution model to study the association between the CIR and 114 factors related to climate, atmospheric environmental quality, terrain, population, economic, human mobility as well as non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Not only the changes in determinants over time as the pandemic progresses but also their lag and interaction effects were examined. CO, O3, PM10 and PM2.5 were found positively linked with CIR, but the effect of NO2 was negative. The temperature had no significant association with CIR, and the daily minimum humidity was a significant negatively predictor. NPIs' level was negatively associated with CIR until with a lag of 15 days. Higher accumulated destination migration scale flow from the epicenter and lower distance to the epicenter (DisWH) were associated with a higher CIR, however, the interaction between DisWH and the time was positive. The more economically developed and more densely populated cities have a higher probability of CIR occurrence, but they may not have a higher CIR intensity.The COVID-19 diffusion are caused by a multiplicity of environmental, economic, social factors as well as NPIs. First, multiple pollutants carried simultaneously on particulate matter affect COVID-19 transmission. Second, the temperature has a limited impact on the spread of the epidemic. Third, NPIs must last for at least 15 days or longer before the effect has been apparent. Fourth, the impact of population movement from the epicenter on COVID-19 gradually diminished over time and intraregional migration deserves more attention.","Qiu, Juan Li Rendong Han Dongfeng Shao Qihui Han Yifei Luo Xiyue Wu Yanlin","One health (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",,133

Here we determined the cryo-EM structures of the spikes from bat (RaTG13) and pangolin (PCoV_GX) coronaviruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2. All three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of these two spike trimers are in the ""down"" conformation, indicating they are more prone to adopt the receptor-binding inactive state. However, we found that the PCoV_GX, but not the RaTG13, spike is comparable to the SARS-CoV-2 spike in binding the human ACE2 receptor and supporting pseudovirus cell entry. We further identified critical residues in the RBD underlying different activities of the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX/SARS-CoV-2 spikes. These results collectively indicate that tight RBD-ACE2 binding and efficient RBD conformational sampling are required for the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to gain highly efficient infection.","Zhang, Shuyuan; Qiao, Shuyuan; Yu, Jinfang; Zeng, Jianwei; Shan, Sisi; Tian, Long; Lan, Jun; Zhang, Linqi; Wang, Xinquan",Nat Commun,,133

507884,Physiological implications of COVID-19 in reproduction: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 a key player,2021,"BACKGROUND: To date, 750â000 patients with COVID-19 worldwide have required mechanical ventilation and thus are at high risk of acute brain dysfunction (coma and delirium). We aimed to investigate the prevalence of delirium and coma, and risk factors for delirium in critically ill patients with COVID-19, to aid the development of strategies to mitigate delirium and associated sequelae. METHODS: This multicentre cohort study included 69 adult intensive care units (ICUs), across 14 countries. We included all patients (aged &#8805;18 years) admitted to participating ICUs with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection before April 28, 2020. Patients who were moribund or had life-support measures withdrawn within 24 h of ICU admission, prisoners, patients with pre-existing mental illness, neurodegenerative disorders, congenital or acquired brain damage, hepatic coma, drug overdose, suicide attempt, or those who were blind or deaf were excluded. We collected de-identified data from electronic health records on patient demographics, delirium and coma assessments, and management strategies for a 21-day period. Additional data on ventilator support, ICU length of stay, and vital status was collected for a 28-day period. The primary outcome was to determine the prevalence of delirium and coma and to investigate any associated risk factors associated with development of delirium the next day. We also investigated predictors of number of days alive without delirium or coma. These outcomes were investigated using multivariable regression. FINDINGS: Between Jan 20 and April 28, 2020, 4530 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to 69 ICUs, of whom 2088 patients were included in the study cohort. The median age of patients was 64 years (IQR 54 to 71) with a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II of 40·0 (30·0 to 53·0). 1397 (66·9%) of 2088 patients were invasively mechanically ventilated on the day of ICU admission and 1827 (87·5%) were invasively mechanical ventilated at some point during hospitalisation. Infusion with sedatives while on mechanical ventilation was common: 1337 (64·0%) of 2088 patients were given benzodiazepines for a median of 7·0 days (4·0 to 12·0) and 1481 (70·9%) were given propofol for a median of 7·0 days (4·0 to 11·0). Median Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score while on invasive mechanical ventilation was -4 (-5 to -3). 1704 (81·6%) of 2088 patients were comatose for a median of 10·0 days (6·0 to 15·0) and 1147 (54·9%) were delirious for a median of 3·0 days (2·0 to 6·0). Mechanical ventilation, use of restraints, and benzodiazepine, opioid, and vasopressor infusions, and antipsychotics were each associated with a higher risk of delirium the next day (all p&#8804;0·04), whereas family visitation (in person or virtual) was associated with a lower risk of delirium (p<0·0001). During the 21-day study period, patients were alive without delirium or coma for a median of 5·0 days (0·0 to 14·0). At baseline, older age, higher SAPS II scores, male sex, smoking or alcohol abuse, use of vasopressors on day 1, and invasive mechanical ventilation on day 1 were independently associated with fewer days alive and free of delirium and coma (all p<0·01). 601 (28·8%) of 2088 patients died within 28 days of admission, with most of those deaths occurring in the ICU. INTERPRETATION: Acute brain dysfunction was highly prevalent and prolonged in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Benzodiazepine use and lack of family visitation were identified as modifiable risk factors for delirium, and thus these data present an opportunity to reduce acute brain dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.

510545,The intracellular renin-angiotensin system: Friend or foe. Some light from the dopaminergic neurons,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 mortality risk is associated with demographic and behavioural factors; furthermore, religious gatherings have been linked with the spread of COVID-19. We sought to understand the variation in risk of COVID-19-related death across religious groups in England and Wales both before and after the first national lockdown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of usual residents in England and Wales enumerated at the 2011 Census (n=47 873 294, estimated response rate 94%) for risk of death involving COVID-19 using linked death certificates. Cox regression models were estimated to compare risks between religious groups. Time-dependent coefficients were added to the model allowing HRs before and after lockdown period to be estimated separately. RESULTS: Compared with Christians, all religious groups had an elevated risk of death involving COVID-19; the largest age-adjusted HRs were for Muslim and Jewish males at 2.5 (95% CI 2.3 to 2.7) and 2.1 (95% CI 1.9 to 2.5), respectively. The corresponding HRs for Muslim and Jewish females were 1.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.1) and 1.5 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.1), respectively. The difference in risk between groups contracted after lockdown. Those who affiliated with no religion had the lowest risk of COVID-19-related death before and after lockdown. CONCLUSION: The majority of the variation in COVID-19 mortality risk was explained by controlling for sociodemographic and geographic determinants; however, those of Jewish affiliation remained at a higher risk of death compared with all other groups. Lockdown measures were associated with reduced differences in COVID-19 mortality rates between religious groups; further research is required to understand the causal mechanisms.","Gaughan, Charlotte Hannah; Ayoubkhani, Daniel; Nafilyan, Vahe; Goldblatt, Peter; White, Chris; TIngay, Karen; Bannister, Neil",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,133

METHODS: Patient and operator manikins were used to recreate a dental setting inside a custom-built class III cabinet-like chamber. The mouth of the patient manikin was inoculated with an HCoV-229E suspension, the viral load of which was similar to that of asymptomatic people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The dental procedure was performed with an air turbine handpiece and HVE for 10 seconds. The efficacy of surgical masks, N95 (filtering facepiece class 2) and filtering facepiece class 3 respirators, and face shields was tested via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The wide surface on which the inoculum was spread caused low contamination. Over the external surfaces of masks and respirators, when a face shield was not worn, viral loads ranged from 1.2 through 1.4 log10 mean gene copies per cm2. When the shield was worn, viral loads dropped below the detection limit (< 0.317 log10 gene copies/cm2) for all PPE. On the operator's forehead, viral loads were 0.6 through 0.8 log10 gene copies/cm2. Inside the operator manikin's mouth, viral loads were under the detection limit when using any PPE, with or without the shield. HVE did not significantly change viral loads. CONCLUSIONS: All PPE combinations significantly reduced viral loads in the operator manikin's mouth to below the detection limit, but HVE did not decrease viral contamination. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Although caution is suggested when removing and disposing of PPE to avoid self-contamination, the combination of PPE and face shields drastically decreases the risk of transmitting human coronavirus during aerosol-generating dental procedures.","Ionescu, Andrei Cristian; Brambilla, Eugenio; Manzoli, Lamberto; Orsini, Giovanna; Gentili, Valentina; Rizzo, Roberta",J Am Dent Assoc,,133

514682,Letter to Editor in response to Dr. Gupta,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented health crisis as entire populations have been asked to self-isolate and live in home-confinement for several weeks to months, which in itself represents a physiological challenge with significant health risks. This paper describes the impact of sedentarism on the human body at the level of the muscular, cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine and nervous systems and is based on evidence from several models of inactivity, including bed rest, unilateral limb suspension, and step-reduction. Data form these studies show that muscle wasting occurs rapidly, being detectable within two days of inactivity. This loss of muscle mass is associated with fibre denervation, neuromuscular junction damage and upregulation of protein breakdown, but is mostly explained by the suppression of muscle protein synthesis. Inactivity also affects glucose homeostasis as just few days of step reduction or bed rest, reduce insulin sensitivity, principally in muscle. Additionally, aerobic capacity is impaired at all levels of the O2 cascade, from the cardiovascular system, including peripheral circulation, to skeletal muscle oxidative function. Positive energy balance during physical inactivity is associated with fat deposition, associated with systemic inflammation and activation of antioxidant defences, exacerbating muscle loss. Importantly, these deleterious effects of inactivity can be diminished by routine exercise practice, but the exercise dose-response relationship is currently unknown. Nevertheless, low to medium-intensity high volume resistive exercise, easily implementable in home-settings, will have positive effects, particularly if combined with a 15-25% reduction in daily energy intake. This combined regimen seems ideal for preserving neuromuscular, metabolic and cardiovascular health.Highlights This paper describes the impact of sedentarism, caused by the COVID-19 home confinement on the neuromuscular, cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrine systems.Just few days of sedentary lifestyle are sufficient to induce muscle loss, neuromuscular junction damage and fibre denervation, insulin resistance, decreased aerobic capacity, fat deposition and low-grade systemic inflammation.Regular low/medium intensity high volume exercise, together with a 15-25% reduction in caloric intake are recommended for preserving neuromuscular, cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrine health.","Narici, Marco; De Vito, Giuseppe; Franchi, Martino; Paoli, Antonio; Moro, Tatiana; Marcolin, Giuseppe; Grassi, Bruno; Baldassarre, Giovanni; Zuccarelli, Lucrezia; Biolo, Gianni; di Girolamo, Filippo Giorgio; Fiotti, Nicola; Dela, Flemming; Greenhaff, Paul; Maganaris, Constantinos",Eur J Sport Sci,,133

In the meantime, a rapid number of ML models have been proposed for predicate the cases of COVID-19. Thus, there is need for an evaluation and benchmarking of COVID-19 ML models which considered the main challenge of this study. Furthermore, there is no single study have addressed the problem of evaluation and benchmarking of COVID diagnosis models. However, this study proposed an intelligent methodology is to help the health organisations in the selection COVID-19 diagnosis system. The benchmarking and evaluation of diagnostic models for COVID-19 is not a trivial process. There are multiple criteria requires to evaluate and some of the criteria are conflicting with each other. Our study is formulated as a decision matrix (DM) that embedded mix of ten evaluation criteria and twelve diagnostic models for COVID-19. The multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method is employed to evaluate and benchmarking the different diagnostic models for COVID19 with respect to the evaluation criteria. An integrated MCDM method are proposed where TOPSIS applied for the benchmarking and ranking purpose while Entropy used to calculate the weights of criteria. The study results revealed that the benchmarking and selection problems associated with COVID19 diagnosis models can be effectively solved using the integration of Entropy and TOPSIS. The SVM (linear) classifier is selected as the best diagnosis model for COVID19 with the closeness coefficient value of 0.9899 for our case study data. Furthermore, the proposed methodology has solved the significant variance for each criterion in terms of ideal best and worst best value, beside issue when specific diagnosis models have same ideal best value.","Mohammed, Mazin Abed; Abdulkareem, Karrar Hameed; Al-Waisy, Alaa S.; Mostafa, Salama A.; Al-Fahdawi, Shumoos; Dinar, Ahmed Musa; Alhakami, Wajdi; Baz, Abdullah; Al-Mhiqani, Mohammed Nasser; Alhakami, Hosam; Arbaiy, Nureize; Maashi, Mashael S.; Mutlag, Ammar Awad; Garcia-Zapirain, Begona; De La Torre Diez, Isabel",IEEE Access,,133

The proposed AI-based system works on chest x-ray (CXR) images to predict whether a patient is infected with the COVID-19 disease. Although the recent international joint effort on making the availability of all sorts of open data, the public collection of CXR images is still relatively small for reliably training a deep neural network (DNN) to carry out COVID-19 prediction. To better address such inefficiency, we design a cascaded learning strategy to improve both the sensitivity and the specificity of the resulting DNN classification model. Our approach leverages a large CXR image dataset of non-COVID-19 pneumonia to generalize the original well-trained classification model via a cascaded learning scheme. The resulting screening system is shown to achieve good classification performance on the expanded dataset, including those newly added COVID-19 CXR images.","Yeh, Chun-Fu; Cheng, Hsien-Tzu; Wei, Andy; Chen, Hsin-Ming; Kuo, Po-Chen; Liu, Keng-Chi; Ko, Mong-Chi; Chen, Ray-Jade; Lee, Po-Chang; Chuang, Jen-Hsiang; Chen, Chi-Mai; Chen, Yi-Chang; Lee, Wen-Jeng; Chien, Ning; Chen, Jo-Yu; Huang, Yu-Sen; Chang, Yu-Chien; Huang, Yu-Cheng; Chou, Nai-Kuan; Chao, Kuan-Hua; Tu, Yi-Chin; Chang, Yeun-Chung; Liu, Tyng-Luh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12786v2.pdf,133

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic on 13 March 2020 and its rapid onset, spatial extent and complex consequences make it a once-in-a-century global disaster. Most countries responded by social distancing measures and severely diminished economic and other activities. Consequently, by the end of April 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to numerous environmental impacts, both positive such as enhanced air and water quality in urban areas, and negative, such as shoreline pollution due to the disposal of sanitary consumables. This study presents an early overview of the observed and potential impacts of the COVID-19 on the environment. We argue that the effects of COVID-19 are determined mainly by anthropogenic factors which are becoming obvious as human activity diminishes across the planet, and the impacts on cities and public health will be continued in the coming years.","Cheval, S.; Adamescu, C.

520483,SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) clinical data: A review of the literature,2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients hospitalised with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19)] infection are frequently older with co-morbidities and receiving polypharmacy, all of which are known risk factors for drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The pharmacological burden may be further aggravated by the addition of treatments for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the risk of potential DDIs upon admission and during hospitalisation in patients with COVID-19 treated at our hospital. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 502 patients with COVID-19 (mean age 61 ± 16 years, range 15-99) treated at our hospital with a proven diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalised between 21 February and 30 April 2020 and treated with at least two drugs. RESULTS: Overall, 68% of our patients with COVID-19 were exposed to at least one potential DDI, and 55% were exposed to at least one potentially severe DDI. The proportion of patients experiencing potentially severe DDIs increased from 22% upon admission to 80% during hospitalisation. Furosemide, amiodarone and quetiapine were the main drivers of potentially severe DDIs upon admission, and hydroxychloroquine and particularly lopinavir/ritonavir were the main drivers during hospitalisation. The majority of potentially severe DDIs carried an increased risk of cardiotoxicity. No potentially severe DDIs were identified in relation to tocilizumab and remdesivir. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalised patients with COVID-19, concomitant treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine led to a dramatic increase in the number of potentially severe DDIs. Given the high risk of cardiotoxicity and the scant and conflicting data concerning their efficacy in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection, the use of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19 with polypharmacy needs to be carefully considered.","Cattaneo, Dario; Pasina, Luca; Maggioni, Aldo Pietro; Giacomelli, Andrea; Oreni, Letizia; Covizzi, Alice; Bradanini, Lucia; Schiuma, Marco; Antinori, Spinello; Ridolfo, Annalisa; Gervasoni, Cristina",Drugs Aging,,133

Researchers are providing mounting evidence of relationships between COVID-19 lockdowns and sleep problems. However, few studies have investigated the impact of home isolation on sleep time perception, especially in comparable social isolation situations with similar pressures. Subjective sleep time perception parameters were derived from sleep diaries. Objective parameters were derived from actigraphy. Subjective and objective data were obtained between February 17 and February 27, 2020 from 70 adult participants subject to COVID-19 related lockdown provisions in China. We divided participants into a home stayers (HS) group (subject to full stay-at home orders) and an area-restricted workers (ARW) group (permitted to work at their nearby workplaces). The HS group demonstrated significantly delayed actigraphy-defined sleep onset time compared to self-reported sleep onset time; this effect was absent in the ARW group. Between-group differences in actigraphy-defined sleep onset time and significant between-group differences for actigraphy-defined and self-reported wake-up time were observed. HS group participants also presented significantly delayed actigraphy-defined wake-up time compared with self-reported wake-up time. No significant effect was found on total sleep time perception. Moreover, sleep/wake time misperception were found to be associated with daylight exposure and physical activity levels respectively. To the extent they are generalizable, these results suggest that lockdown restrictions can affect sleep onset and wake-up time perception but not total sleep time perception. Public health policy should consider such effects in the present pandemic situation and in future emergent public health situations.","He, Ling; Zhao, Wenrui; Gao, Yuan; Gao, Xiao; Lei, Xu",Int J Psychophysiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167876021002075?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2021.07.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167876021002075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34252481/,133

In response to CDC reports, Public Health Ontario Laboratories (PHOL) launched an investigation of patients being tested for enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68) in Ontario, Canada. The purpose of this investigation was to enhance our understanding of EV-D68 epidemiology and clinical features. Data for this study included specimens submitted for EV-D68 testing at PHOL from September 1, 2014 to October 31, 2014. Comparisons were made between patients who tested positive for the virus (cases) and those testing negative (controls). EV-D68 was identified in 153/907 (16.8%) of patients tested. In the logistic regression model adjusting for age, sex, setting and time to specimen collection, individuals younger than 20 years of age were more likely to be diagnosed with EV-D68 compared to those 20 and over, with peak positivity at ages 5–9 years. Cases were not more likely to be hospitalized than controls. Cases were more likely to be identified in September than October (OR 8.07; 95% CI 5.15 to 12.64). Routine viral culture and multiplex PCR were inadequate methods to identify EV-D68 due to poor sensitivity and inability to differentiate EV-D68 from other enterovirus serotypes or rhinovirus. Testing for EV-D68 in Ontario from July to December, 2014 detected the presence of EV-D68 virus among young children during September-October, 2014, with most cases detected in September. There was no difference in hospitalization status between cases and controls. In order to better understand the epidemiology of this virus, surveillance for EV-D68 should include testing of symptomatic individuals from all treatment settings and patient age groups, with collection and analysis of comprehensive clinical and epidemiological data.","Peci, Adriana; Winter, Anne-Luise; Warshawsky, Bryna; Booth, Tim F.; Eshaghi, AliReza; Li, Aimin; Perusini, Stephen; Olsha, Romy; Marchand-Austin, Alex; Kristjanson, Erik; Gubbay, Jonathan B.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0142841; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26599365/,133

HF is a major public health problem with high prevalence and incidence, involving both high morbidity and mortality, but also high economic costs. The incidence of HF progressively increases with age, reaching around 20% among people over 75 years old. Indeed, HF represents the leading cause of hospitalization in patients older than 65 years in Western countries. Hence, some authors even consider HF a geriatric syndrome, entailing worse prognosis and high residual disability, and often associating some complex comorbidities, common in older population, that may further complicate the course of the disease. On the other hand, however, clinical course and prognosis may be often difficult to predict. In this article, main pathophysiological issues related to the aging heart are addressed, together with key aspects related to both diagnosis and prognosis in elderly patients with HF. Besides, main geriatric conditions, common in the elderly population, are reviewed, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach.","Díez-Villanueva, Pablo; Jiménez-Méndez, César; Alfonso, Fernando",J Geriatr Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.11909/j.issn.1671-5411.2021.03.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907552/,133

METHODS: Scheduled screening mammograms during three time periods were retrospectively reviewed: state-mandated shutdown (3/17/2020-6/16/2020) during which screening mammography was cancelled, a period of 2 months immediately after screening mammography resumed (6/17/2020-8/16/2020), and a representative period prior to COVID-19 (6/17/2019-8/16/2019). Relative risk of cancellation before COVID-19 and after reopening was compared for age, race/ethnicity, insurance, history of chronic disease, and exam location, controlling for other collected variables. Risk of failure to reschedule was similarly compared between all 3 time periods. RESULTS: Overall cancellation rate after reopening was higher than before shutdown (7663/16595, 46% vs 5807/15792, 37%; p < 0.001). Relative risk of cancellation after reopening increased with age (1.20 vs 1.27 vs 1.36 for ages at 25th, 50th, and 75th quartile or 53, 61, and 70 years, respectively, p < 0.001). Relative risk of cancellation was also higher among Medicare patients (1.41) compared to Medicaid and those with other providers (1.26 and 1.21, respectively, p < 0.001) and non-whites compared to whites (1.34 vs 1.25, p = 0.03). Rescheduling rate during shutdown was higher than before COVID-19 and after reopening for all patients (10,658/13593, 78%, 3569/5807, 61%, and 4243/7663, respectively, 55%, p < 0.001).

The viral spike receptor possesses two surface areas of high mutagenic plasticity: the supersite in its N-terminal domain (NTD) that is recognised by all anti-NTD antibodies and its receptor binding domain (RBD) where 17 residues make contact with the human Ace2 protein (angiotensin I converting enzyme 2) and many neutralising antibodies bind. While NTD mutations appear at first glance very diverse, they converge on the structure of the supersite. The mutations within the RBD, on the other hand, hone in on only a small number of key sites (K417, L452, E484, N501) that are allosteric control points enabling spike to escape neutralising antibodies while maintaining or even gaining Ace2-binding activity. The D614G mutation is the hallmark of all variants, as it promotes viral spread by increasing the number of open spike protomers in the homo-trimeric receptor complex.

The following parameters were analyzed: mean heart rate (mHR), bradycardia and tachycardia episodes defined as HR <40bpm and HR> 100 bpm, PQ duration, QRS durations, the Bazett-corrected QT interval, changes in the ST-T segment and the T wave. Additionally heart rhythm disturbances were assessed and atrial fibrillation/flutter episodes, the presence of atrial premature contractions (APCs), ventricular premature contractions VES) Number of atrioventricular blocks, bundle branch blocs (BBB) – (RBBB, LBBB, a nonspecific intraventricular conduction block) were also analyzed. RESULTS: 264 pts were included to final assessment, with mean age 43,5 ± 13,5 years. The results were as follow: HR <40bpm - in 0pts, HR> 100 bpm in 9(3%)pts, PQ duration > 200ms in 7(3%)pts, QRS durations > 100ms in 19(6%)pts, QTc interval in 16 (6%)pts, ST-T segment abnormalities in 21(8%)pts and the T wave abnormalities in16(6%)pts Following heart rhythm disturbances were noted: AF/AFl in 0pts, (APCs) in 0pts, VES – in 3(1%)pts. No episodes of atrioventricular blocks were recorded, but BB in bundle branch blocs (BBB) – (RBBB, LBBB, a nonspecific intraventricular conduction block) in 14 (3%) pts were noted. Conclusions. The most frequent ECG abnormalities in pts without co-morbidities after COVID-19 without hospitalization were ST-T segment and T abnormalities. A large number of changes in ECG confirms that we can expect cardiac involvement also in the group of patients with mild and moderate course of COVID-19.","Chudzik, M; Oszczygiel, E; Miskowiec, D; Kasprzak, JD",Europace,https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euab116.529,133

607336,The Impact of RSV-Associated Respiratory Disease on Children in Asia,2018-04-11,"The pulmonary function test (PFT) is an important test for risk stratification before allogeneic transplantation (allo-HCT). However, it might be preferable to avoid PFT as much as possible in the recent era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), because PFT requires forced expirations and might produce aerosol, increasing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, we tried to predict normal PFT results before allo-HCT based on computed tomography (CT) findings. This study included 390 allo-HCT recipients at our center for whom lung CT images and PFT results before allo-HCT were available. Abnormal CT findings were less likely to be observed in the normal PFT group (47.0% vs 67.4%, P = 0.015), with a high negative predictive value of 92.9%. In a multivariate analysis, normal CT was significantly associated with normal PFT (odds ratio 2.47 (95% CI 1.22 – 4.97), P = 0.012). A model for predicting normal PFT was constructed based on the results of a multivariate analysis and the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic analysis was 0.656, which gave a sensitivity of 45.5% and a specificity of 86.0%. The relatively high specificity of the model suggested that PFT can be omitted in patients with normal CT findings before allo-HCT.","Tamaki, Masaharu; Nakasone, Hideki; Aikawa, Tadao; Nakamura, Yuhei; Kawamura, Masakatsu; Kawamura, Shunto; Takeshita, Junko; Yoshino, Nozomu; Misaki, Yukiko; Yoshimura, Kazuki; Matsumi, Shinpei; Gomyo, Ayumi; Tanihara, Aki; Kusuda, Machiko; Akahoshi, Yu; Kimura, Shun-ichi; Kako, Shinichi; Oyama-Manabe, Noriko; Kanda, Yoshinobu",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32860909/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1083879120305401?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2020.08.025; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1083879120305401,133

In the present scenario CoVs has been transmitted to the European and American regions through the travellers from wide spread countries like China and Japan. The viral disease is spreading through the contact in any form by the infected persons or patients and creating huge risk of mortality. CoVs are a single positive-sense RNA virus; mutation rates are higher than DNA viruses and indicate a more effective survival adaption mechanism. Human CoVs can cause common cold and influenza-like illness and a variety of severe acute respiratory disease such as pneumonia. Early in infection, CoVs infects epithelial cells, macrophages, T-cells, dendritic cells and also can affect the development and implantation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. It mainly produces the melanoma differentiation associated with protein-5, retinoic acid inducible gene-1 and endosomal toll-like receptor 3. How CoVs affects the function of the immune system is still unclear due to lack of this knowledge. No Food and Drug Administration approved treatment is available till date. In this review, we are tried to explore the epidemiology, pathogenesis and current treatment of CoVs infection. The promising therapeutics molecules against CoVs and future prospective have been also discussed which will be helpful for researchers to find out the new molecules for the treatment of CoVs disease.","Raj, Khadga; Rohit; Ghosh, Anirban; Singh, Shamsher",Virusdisease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13337-020-00580-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313824/,133

Various types of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are explored along with novel molecular diagnostic testing that ultimately may prove useful in the critical care setting. Data Sources – PUBMED was searched to obtain relevant references material using keywords: ‘canine OR feline meningitis AND meningoencephalitis,’‘feline infectious peritonitis,’‘canine distemper,’‘canine OR feline AND toxoplasma,’‘canine neospora,’‘canine OR feline AND rickettsia,’‘granulomatous meningoencephalitis,’‘steroid responsive meningitis arteritis,’‘necrotizing encephalitis,’‘novel neurodiagnostics,’‘canine OR feline AND CNS borrelia,’‘canine OR feline AND CNS bartonella,’‘canine OR feline AND CNS fungal,’‘nested OR multiplex OR degenerate OR consensus OR CODEHOP AND PCR.’ Research findings from the authors' laboratory and current veterinary textbooks also were utilized. Human Data Synthesis – Molecular diagnostic testing including conventional, real‐time, and consensus and degenerate PCR and microarray analysis are utilized routinely for the antemortem diagnosis of infectious meningoencephalitis (ME) in humans. Recently, PCR using consensus degenerate hybrid primers (CODEHOP) has been used to identify and characterize a number of novel human viruses. Veterinary Data Synthesis – Molecular diagnostic testing such as conventional and real‐time PCR aid in the diagnosis of several important central nervous system infectious agents including canine distemper virus, Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, rickettsial species, and others. Recently, broadly reactive consensus and degenerate PCR reactions have been applied to canine ME including assays for rickettsial organisms, Borrelia spp. and Bartonella spp., and various viral families. Conclusions – In the acute neurologic patient, there are several key infectious diseases that can be pursued by a combination of conventional and molecular diagnostic testing.

Any physical, chemical, or biological unexpected or unidentified food constituent may exhibit harmful effects on people and animals from mild to severe reactions. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), unsafe foodstuffs are especially dangerous for infants, young children, elderly, and chronic patients. It is imperative to continuously develop new technologies to detect foodborne pathogens and contaminants in order to aid the strengthening of healthcare and economic systems. In recent years, peptide-based sensors gained much attention in the field of food research as an alternative to immuno-, apta-, or DNA-based sensors. This review presents an overview of the electrochemical biosensors using peptides as molecular bio-recognition elements published mainly in the last decade, highlighting their possible application for rapid, non-destructive, and in situ analysis of food samples. Comparison with peptide-based optical and piezoelectrical sensors in terms of analytical performance is presented.

Current risk stratification among these patients relies on personal experience and extrapolation from patients with acquired heart disease. We aimed to provide an expert view on risk stratification while awaiting results from observational studies. METHODS: This study was an initiative of the EPOCH (European Collaboration for Prospective Outcome Research in Congenital Heart disease). Among nine European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland), 24 experts from 23 tertiary ACHD centres participated in the survey. ACHD experts were asked to identify ACHD-specific COVID-19 risk factors from a list of potential outcome predictors and to estimate the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes in seven commonly seen patient scenarios. RESULTS: 82% of participants did not consider all ACHD patients at risk of COVID-19 related complications. There was a consensus on pulmonary arterial hypertension, Fontan physiology and cyanotic heart disease as risk factors for adverse outcomes. Among different ACHD scenarios, a patient with Eisenmenger syndrome was considered to be at the highest risk. There was a marked variability in risk estimation among the other potential outcome predictors and ACHD scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary arterial hypertension, Fontan palliation and cyanotic heart disease were widely considered as risk factors for poor outcome in COVID-19. However, there was a marked disparity in risk estimation for other clinical scenarios. We are in urgent need of outcome studies in ACHD suffering from COVID-19.","Ruperti-Repilado, Francisco Javier; Tobler, Daniel; Greutmann, Matthias; Bouchardy, Judith; Ladouceur, Magalie; Dos-Subira, Laura; Gallego, Pastora; Gabriel, Harald; Bouma, Berto; Schwerzmann, Markus",Open Heart,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33883228/; https://doi.org/10.1136/openhrt-2020-001455,133

Therefore, our study's purpose is to stratify these risk factors and use them to predict outcomes. Study Design: This is a retrospective review of the CDC COVID-19 Surveillance Data. Logistic regression models calculated risk estimates for independent variables, and random forest models predicted the chance of severe outcomes. Results: Our sample of 3,798,261 patients with COVID-19 consisted mainly of females (51.9%), 10- to 69-year-olds, and White/Non-Hispanics (34.9%). Most were not healthcare workers (90.6%) and did not have preexisting medical conditions (47.1%). Age had an increased risk of severe outcomes that grew every decade of life. White patients had a decreased occurrence of severe outcomes than Non-Whites, except for Pacific Islanders with comparable mortality. The variable selection algorithm detected that three outcomes were more accurate without healthcare worker classification: mechanical ventilation/intubation, pneumonia, and ARDS Acute respiratory distress. However, providers had a decreased risk of severe outcomes overall. Also, patients with preexisting conditions demonstrated an increased risk in all outcomes. Compared to the logistic regressions, the predictive models had a higher performance (AUC>0.8). The death model had the best metrics, followed by hospitalization and ventilation. We amassed these predictive models into the Severe COVID-19 Calculator web application that estimates the probability of severe outcomes. Conclusions: Several patient social and medical demographics recorded by the CDC significantly affect severe COVID-19 outcomes suggesting a multifactorial influence. To account for these variables, a generated Severe Covid-19 Calculator can accurately predict the chance of severe outcomes in citizens that may contract or have COVID-19.","Morada, A.

We aimed to evaluate the results of endoscopic surgery by comparing preoperative classification methods and investigating their relationship with postoperative resection and remission rates and complications. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 236 patients (118 males) who underwent surgery for pituitary adenomas. Preoperative Knosp classification, tumor size (TS), suprasellar extension (SSE), postoperative resection and remission rates, and complications were evaluated. RESULTS: The follow-up period was 3 months to 6 years. The patients’ ages ranged between 16 and 84 years. Endocrinologically, 114 patients (48.3%) had functional adenoma (FA), and 122 patients (51.7%) had non-functional adenoma (NFA). Among the FA group, 92 (80.7%) showed remission. A statistically significant difference was found between patients with and without remission in terms of the Knosp, TS, and SSE classifications (p<0.01). Knosp, TS, and SSE classification grades were found to be correlated with the resection rates (p<0.01). Meningitis was seen in seven patients (3.0%), diabetes insipidus in 16 (6.9%; permanently in two [0.9%]), and rhinorrhea in 19 (8.1%). Thirty-six patients (15.3%) developed pituitary insufficiency and received hormone replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: The resection categories and remission rates of FAs were directly proportional to the adenoma sizes and Knosp grades, while the degree of suprasellar growth further complicated resection and remission rates. Adenoma sizes less than 2 cm and SSEs less than 1 cm are associated with favorable remission and resection rates.","Erkan, Buruc; Barut, Ozan; Akbas, Ahmet; Akpinar, Ebubekir; Akdeniz, Yasemin Sefika; Tanriverdi, Osman; Gunaldi, Omur",J Korean Neurosurg Soc,https://doi.org/10.3340/jkns.2020.0207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853298/,133

After a preliminary Phase I, open-label study (n = 25) to assess safety 1–14 days post-vaccination, a comparative observer-blind, randomised, controlled clinical trial (n = 600) was performed to assess safety and immunogenicity versus a non-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine (Subunit; Agrippal(®), Novartis Vaccines). Subjects were randomised (2:1) to receive Sub/MF59™ or Subunit. RESULTS: Both vaccines were well tolerated, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events reported during the Phase I trial. During the observer-blind study, local and systemic reactions were generally similar for both vaccines 1–22 days post-vaccination; however, injection-site induration was more frequent among the Subunit group (P < 0.05), and mild pain at the injection site and fever were more frequent among Sub/MF59™ recipients (P ≤ 0.005). Both vaccines induced a significant (P < 0.001) increase in geometric mean titres (GMTs) for the three strains tested, versus baseline; GMTs against A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B were significantly higher in the Sub/MF59™ group (P = 0.034, P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). GMT ratios against A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B were also significantly higher in the Sub/MF59™ group (P = 0.038, P < 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively). Similarly, the percentage of subjects achieving seroprotection or seroconversion on Day 22 was greater for Sub/MF59™ recipients, reaching significance for A/H3N2 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: MF59™-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine is well tolerated by elderly Chinese subjects and induces a higher level of immunogenicity than a non-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine in this population that is at high risk of influenza-related complications.

It is a state of out-of-control release of a variety of inflammatory cytokines. The molecular mechanism of the cytokine storm has not been explored extensively yet. The attachment of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as its cellular receptor, triggers complex molecular events that leads to hyperinflammation. Four molecular axes that may be involved in SARS-CoV-2 driven inflammatory cytokine overproduction are addressed in this work. The virus-mediated down-regulation of ACE2 causes a burst of inflammatory cytokine release through dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (ACE/angiotensin II/AT1R axis), attenuation of Mas receptor (ACE2/MasR axis), increased activation of [des-Arg9]-bradykinin (ACE2/bradykinin B1R/DABK axis), and activation of the complement system including C5a and C5b-9 components. The molecular clarification of these axes will elucidate an array of therapeutic strategies to confront the cytokine storm in order to prevent and treat COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Mahmudpour, Mehdi; Roozbeh, Jamshid; Keshavarz, Mohsen; Farrokhi, Shokrollah; Nabipour, Iraj",Cytokine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32544563/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466620301678?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466620301678; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155151,133

One approach to support this change in education delivery is the use of virtual simulation approaches. Our team at SimXSpace has piloted a virtual workshop using Zoom, an online video-conferencing platform, and virtual simulated persons (SPs) to support communication and interpersonal skills among learners. The main objective of the pilot virtual workshop was to develop and implement the SP methodology remotely via the Zoom platform (Zoom Video Communications, San Jose, California) and to evaluate its effectiveness as an immersive environment for simulation. The virtual workshop involved four instructors who intend to implement virtual SPs within their courses, two workshop facilitators, and two SPs. The workshop was conducted synchronously using Zoom features. The workshop followed a predefined structure and was completed as planned. Outcomes suggest that remote simulation delivery using virtual SPs and delivered online via Zoom is feasible and provides an effective environment in which to conduct SP methodology to teach communication and interpersonal skills. The findings suggest that remote simulation and virtual SPs can support experiential education and provide an effective and engaging learning environment. The virtual workshop was successful and laid a foundation for future online training programs for the use of SP methodology. Moreover, it formed an effective outline for subsequent iterations of this virtual training workshop and prompted discussion of plans for future workshops with various programs across a pan-university context.","Peisachovich, Eva; Da Silva, Celina; Penhearow, Nathaniel J; Sombilon, Elizabeth V; Koh, Marianne",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32754403/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8864,133

An adult female German Shepherd was attended with clinical history of prostration and hyporexia. The hemogram showed changes compatible with an inflammatory process, for that reason, an abdominal ultrasound was requested. Ultrasound image suggested the presence of D. renale in the right kidney. The diagnosis was confirmed after urinalysis due to the presence of dioctophymas ova in the urinary sediment. Surgical treatment was made and the animal had an excellent recovery after the nephrectomy was performed. Generally, in almost all cases, parasitism by D. renale in domestic dogs is a necropsy finding, nevertheless imaging techniques as sonography and laboratorial exams as urinalysis have been proven to be important tools to achieve diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to report a case of parasitism by D. renale where diagnosis and treatment were made in time to allow the patient's recovery.","Ferreira, Vivian Lindmayer; Medeiros, Fábio Pestana; July, José Roberto; Raso, Tânia Freitas",Vet Parasitol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401709006621; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401709006621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19939566/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.10.013,133

Bystander resuscitation rates differ significantly across the world despite bystanders being easily able to save lives in this situation. In the 4 years since initiation of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) World Restart a Heart (WRAH), the initiative helped educating millions of people and thus enabled them to save lives. RECENT FINDINGS: WRAH Day has gained more and more reach, partners and impact over the years. It has the potential of saving hundreds of thousands of lives, changing legislation and inspiring research. During the last year, new strategies had to be developed because of the COVID-pandemic. The importance of educating laypeople is underlined in recent publications and international guidelines. SUMMARY: The WRAH awareness campaign has reached 194 countries and more than 200 million people in the last years. The success of it could even be kept going in the pandemic due to social media and digital/virtual programmes. International guidelines recommend raising awareness and name ILCOR WRAH as a way to do it.","Rott, Nadine; Böttiger, Bernd W; Lockey, Andrew",Curr. opin. crit. care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34508052/,133

METHODS: In order to address this need, we created a downloadable pedagogical video content through first-person point-of-view to rapidly train users on COVID-19 procedures in the Revinax® Handbook mobile App. Eight new tutorials were designed through this technology platform to assist healthcare workers/responders caring for COVID-19 patients. A survey was then sent to assess their interest. RESULTS: In one-month since the App was created, it was downloaded by 12,516 users and a feedback survey determined that the users valued the tutorials in helping them learn COVID-19 procedures efficiently in real-time. The fast-growing number of downloads and positive user feedback evidences that we created a valuable educational tool with an emergent- and growing-demand. DISCUSSION: The 71.48% App user response rate, showed largely positive feedback of the COVID-19 tutorial. The fact that these healthcare workers/responders took the time to complete the survey during a pandemic was indicative of its immediate value. Further, the App users indicated that they FPV tutorial was rather helpful in addressing their training needs regarding their roles in COVID-19 patient care during the pandemic.

Different research perspectives on health are needed in order to manage and monitor this crisis. Performance intelligence is an approach that emphasises the need for different research perspectives in supporting health systems’ decision-makers to determine policies based on well-informed choices. In this paper, we present the viewpoint of the Innovative Training Network for Healthcare Performance Intelligence Professionals (HealthPros) on how performance intelligence can be used during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: A lack of standardised information, paired with limited discussion and alignment between countries contribute to uncertainty in decision-making in all countries. Consequently, a plethora of different non-data-driven and uncoordinated approaches to address the outbreak are noted worldwide. Comparative health system research is needed to help countries shape their response models in social care, public health, primary care, hospital care and long-term care through the different phases of the pandemic. There is a need in each phase to compare context-specific bundles of measures where the impact on health outcomes can be modelled using targeted data and advanced statistical methods. Performance intelligence can be pursued to compare data, construct indicators and identify optimal strategies. Embracing a system perspective will allow countries to take coordinated strategic decisions while mitigating the risk of system collapse.A framework for the development and implementation of performance intelligence has been outlined by the HealthPros Network and is of pertinence. Health systems need better and more timely data to govern through a pandemic-induced transition period where tensions between care needs, demand and capacity are exceptionally high worldwide. Health systems are challenged to ensure essential levels of healthcare towards all patients, including those who need routine assistance. CONCLUSION: Performance intelligence plays an essential role as part of a broader public health strategy in guiding the decisions of health system actors on the implementation of contextualised measures to tackle COVID-19 or any future epidemic as well as their effect on the health system at large. This should be based on commonly agreed-upon standardised data and fit-for-purpose indicators, making optimal use of existing health information infrastructures. The HealthPros Network can make a meaningful contribution.","Kringos, D.; Carinci, F.; Barbazza, E.; Bos, V.; Gilmore, K.; Groene, O.; Gulácsi, L.; Ivankovic, D.; Jansen, T.; Johnsen, S.

620486,Advances in community-acquired pneumonia,2020-11-06,"Abstract The bovine fetus is capable of mounting an antibody response when a bacterial antigen (killed Escherichia coli) or viral antigen (live reovirus) is deposited into the amniotic fluid. Time required for the fetus to respond to bacterial antigen given orally (amniotic fluid) is approximately 10 to 14 days and 8 to 10 days for viral antigen. Calves vaccinated prenatally with E. coli from 9 to 102 days before birth and deprived of colostrum survived oral challenge doses of viable E. coli which killed calves not vaccinated prenatally. One mechanism of protection was the local production of antibody in the gastrointestinal mucosa where immunofluo rescent techniques showed immunoglobulins IgG, IgM, and anti-E. coli antibody in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum as well as in the jejunal lymph node. Prenatal vaccination has been used in the field for prevention of colibacillosis. However, the occurrence of some stillbirths and premature births indicates the need for further research before there can be widespread field application of the technique.","Conner, G.

To identify and characterize molecular viral determinants influencing the host spectrum of IDV, a reverse genetic system is required. For this, we first performed 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) of all seven genomic segments, followed by assessment of the 5′ and 3′ NCR activity prior to constructing the viral genomic segments of a contemporary Swiss bovine IDV isolate (D/CN286) into the bidirectional pHW2000 vector. The bidirectional plasmids were transfected in HRT-18G cells followed by viral rescue on the same cell type. Analysis of the segment specific 5′ and 3′ non-coding regions (NCR) highlighted that the terminal 3′ end of all segments harbours an uracil instead of a cytosine nucleotide, similar to other influenza viruses. Subsequent analysis on the functionality of the 5′ and 3′ NCR in a minireplicon assay revealed that these sequences were functional and that the variable sequence length of the 5′ and 3′ NCR influences reporter gene expression. Thereafter, we evaluated the replication efficiency of the reverse genetic clone on conventional cell lines of human, swine and bovine origin, as well as by using an in vitro model recapitulating the natural replication site of IDV in bovine and swine. This revealed that the reverse genetic clone D/CN286 replicates efficiently in all cell culture models. Combined, these results demonstrate the successful establishment of a reverse genetic system from a contemporary bovine IDV isolate that can be used for future identification and characterization of viral determinants influencing the broad host tropism of IDV.","Holwerda, Melle; Laloli, Laura; Wider, Manon; Schönecker, Lutz; Becker, Jens; Meylan, Mireille; Dijkman, Ronald",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33803792/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13030502,133

All pigs of groups A and C became infected with PRRSV, according to virological techniques used (immunohistochemistry, virus isolation and virus serology). Lung, heart and tonsils were the most frequently immunolabeled tissues, and monocyte/macrophage lineage cells were the target for PRRSV in all tissues. All pigs in groups A and B also became infected with H. parasuis based on immunohistochemical and bacterial isolation results. Serosal surfaces, lung and tonsils were the most frequently immunolabeled tissues, and bacteria were found in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells as well as within neutrophil cytoplasm. No differences in terms of bacterial distribution or localization in tissues of pigs of groups A and B were detected.

Although our current understanding of the complexity of COVID-19 pathogenesis remains limited, the infection is largely mediated by the interaction of viral spike protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The functional importance of ACE2 in different demographic and comorbid conditions may explain the significant variation in incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in vulnerable groups, and highlights its candidacy as a potential therapeutic target. We provide evidence supporting the idea that differences in incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection may be related to ACE2. Emerging data based on the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 among those with established high levels of ACE2 expression strongly support our hypothesis. Considering the burden of COVID-19 infection in these vulnerable groups and the impact of the potential therapeutic and preventive measures that would result from adopting ACE2-driven anti-viral strategies, our hypothesis may expedite global efforts to control the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Kaseb, Ahmed O.; Mohamed, Yehia I.; Malek, Alexandre E.; Raad, Issam I.; Altameemi, Lina; Li, Dan; Kaseb, Omar A.; Kaseb, Safa A.; Selim, Abdelhafez; Ma, Qing",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10030379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33809851/,133

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Five designated tertiary hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China. PARTICIPANTS: We routinely collected medical data of 1364 confirmed adult patients with COVID-19 between 8 January and 19 March 2020. Among them, 1088 patients from two designated hospitals in Wuhan were used to develop the prognostic model, and 276 patients from three hospitals outside Wuhan were used for external validation. All patients were followed up for a maximal of 60 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: The model discrimination was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Somers’ D test, and calibration was examined by the calibration plot. Decision curve analysis was conducted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 60 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: The full model included seven predictors of age, respiratory failure, white cell count, lymphocytes, platelets, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase. The simple model contained five indicators of age, respiratory failure, coronary heart disease, renal failure and heart failure. After cross-validation, the AUC statistics based on derivation cohort were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.97) for the full model and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89 to 0.95) for the simple model. The AUC statistics based on the external validation cohort were 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.98) for the full model and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.96) for the simple model. Good calibration accuracy of these two models was found in the derivation and validation cohort.

629259,Immunogenicity of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in Patients with Inborn Errors of Immunity.,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND: Responses of subnational government units are crucial in the containment of the spread of pathogens in a country. To mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippine national government through its Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases outlined different quarantine measures wherein each level has a corresponding degree of rigidity from keeping only the essential businesses open to allowing all establishments to operate at a certain capacity. Other measures also involve prohibiting individuals at a certain age bracket from going outside of their homes. The local government units (LGUs)–municipalities and provinces–can adopt any of these measures depending on the extent of the pandemic in their locality. The purpose is to keep the number of infections and mortality at bay while minimizing the economic impact of the pandemic. Some LGUs have demonstrated a remarkable response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study is to identify notable non-pharmaceutical interventions of these outlying LGUs in the country using quantitative methods. METHODS: Data were taken from public databases such as Philippine Department of Health, Philippine Statistics Authority Census, and Google Community Mobility Reports. These are normalized using Z-transform. For each locality, infection and mortality data (dataset Y) were compared to the economic, health, and demographic data (dataset X) using Euclidean metric d=(x−y)(2), where x∈X and y∈Y. If a data pair (x,y) exceeds, by two standard deviations, the mean of the Euclidean metric values between the sets X and Y, the pair is assumed to be a ‘good’ outlier. RESULTS: Our results showed that cluster of cities and provinces in Central Luzon (Region III), CALABARZON (Region IV-A), the National Capital Region (NCR), and Central Visayas (Region VII) are the ‘good’ outliers with respect to factors such as working population, population density, ICU beds, doctors on quarantine, number of frontliners and gross regional domestic product. Among metropolitan cities, Davao was a ‘good’ outlier with respect to demographic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Strict border control, early implementation of lockdowns, establishment of quarantine facilities, effective communication to the public, and monitoring efforts were the defining factors that helped these LGUs curtail the harm that was brought by the pandemic. If these policies are to be standardized, it would help any country’s preparedness for future health emergencies.","S. Talabis, Dylan Antonio; Babierra, Ariel L.; H.

Wellbeing was higher for married compared to single and showed no relation with age, gender, and profession. Additionally, a structural equation model was estimated, in which a positive relation was found between wellbeing and compassion satisfaction and a negative one with burnout. The PWI is adequate to measure personal wellbeing in Spanish palliative care professionals.","Pérez-Belmonte, Sergio; Galiana, Laura; Fernández, Irene; Vidal-Blanco, Gabriel; Sansó, Noemí",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.672792; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34045998/,133

Thus, CatC appears as a potential therapeutic target to impair protease-driven tissue degradation in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. A depletion of proinflammatory elastase-related proteases in neutrophils is observed in patients with CatC deficiency (Papillon–Lefèvre syndrome). To address and counterbalance unwanted effects of elastase-related proteases, chemical inhibitors of CatC are being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials. Neutrophils may contribute to the diffuse alveolar inflammation seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which is currently a growing challenge for intensive care units due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Elimination of elastase-related neutrophil proteases may reduce the progression of lung injury in these patients. Pharmacological CatC inhibition could be a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent the irreversible pulmonary failure threatening the life of COVID-19 patients.","Korkmaz, Brice; Lesner, Adam; Marchand-Adam, Sylvain; Moss, Celia; Jenne, Dieter E.",J Med Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32692176/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00776,133

Some hemodialysis techniques reduce systemic inflammation but their impact on COVID-19 has not been addressed. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate factors associated to mortality in COVID-19 hemodialysis patients, including the impact of reducing interleukin-6 using a cytokine adsorbent filter. METHOD: This is a prospective single-center study including 16 hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. All were dialyzed using a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) filter. Interleukin-6 levels were obtained before and after the first admission hemodialysis session and at one week. Also we collected serum samples from 8 patients of our unit as controls: 4 in online hemodiafiltration (OLHDF) and 4 in high-flux hemodialysis Baseline comorbidities, laboratory values, chest X-ray and treatments were recorded and compared between survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included (13 males, mean age 72±15 years). Four patients (25%) died. Factors associated to mortality were dialysis vintage (p=0.01), the presence of infiltrates in chest X-ray (p=0.032), serum C-reactive protein (p=0.05) and lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.02) at one week, the requirement of oxygen therapy (p=0.02) and the use of anticoagulation (p<0.01). At admission, post-dialysis interleukin-6 levels were higher (p<0.01) in non-survivors and these patients differed from survivors in the reduction of interleukin-6 levels during the dialysis session despite using a PMMA filter (survivors vs non survivors (25 [17-53]% vs -3 [-109-12] %, p=0.04). CONCLUSION: In hemodialysis COVID-19 patients, a positive balance of interleukin-6 during the session was associated to higher mortality.","Muñoz Ramos, Patricia; Giorgi, Martin; Gil Giraldo, Yohana; De Santos, Antonio; Núñez, Almudena; Barril, Guillermina; Quiroga, Borja",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab099.009,133

Early detection is paramount for suitable diagnosis and effective treatment of different kinds of cancers, but this is limited to the accuracy and sensitivity of available diagnostic imaging methods. Breast cancer is the most widely diagnosed cancer among women across the globe with a high percentage of total cancer deaths requiring an intensive, accurate, and sensitive imaging approach. Indeed, it is treatable when detected at an early stage. Hence, the use of state of the art computational approaches has been proposed as a potential alternative approach for the design and development of novel diagnostic imaging methods for breast cancer. Thus, this review provides a concise overview of past and present conventional diagnostics approaches in breast cancer detection. Further, we gave an account of several computational models (machine learning, deep learning, and robotics), which have been developed and can serve as alternative techniques for breast cancer diagnostics imaging. This review will be helpful to academia, medical practitioners, and others for further study in this area to improve the biomedical breast cancer imaging diagnosis.","Aruleba, Kehinde; Obaido, George; Ogbuokiri, Blessing; Fadaka, Adewale Oluwaseun; Klein, Ashwil; Adekiya, Tayo Alex; Aruleba, Raphael Taiwo",J Imaging,https://doi.org/10.3390/jimaging6100105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34460546/,133

Many different agents, such as influenza and parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncitial virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus and herpes virus can be found in immuno-competent patients. Among these pathogens, cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been found to be responsible for nosocomial pneumonia in ICU. The main problem for viral infections, is the diagnosis, isolation of the pathogen is often difficult and not always reliable and the symptoms not specific. However, influenza is characterised by fever, myalgia, headache and pharyngitis, this infection may be very mild, even asymptomatic, moderate or very severe. Finally, the most recent viral pathogen involved in respiratory disease is a newly discovered coronavirus, the SARS-CoV which was responsible for the worldwide outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Viral pneumonia is a common pathology which is probably underdiagnosed in immuno-competent patients; many reports show that even if the diagnosis is difficult to obtain, it is not useless as long as we have, for most of the pathogens, an effective treatment. The gold standard was histology, new techniques like PCR can probably make a difference and should be included in the guidelines to improve diagnostic efficiency.","Guery, B; d'Escrivan, T; Georges, H; Legout, L; Leroy, O; Viget, N; Faure, K",Reanimation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reaurg.2004.02.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1624069304000374; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1624069304000374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288722/,133

The information exchanged can also be exploited for the advancement of research on COVID-19. The platform consists of mobile and desktop applications, sensor infrastructure, and cloud services. It may be used by patients in pre- and post-hospitalization stages, vulnerable populations, medical practitioners, and researchers. RESULTS: The supported audio processing is used to demonstrate how the Coronario platform can assist research on the nature of COVID-19. Cough sounds are classified as a case study, with 90% accuracy. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic adaptation to new medical protocols is one of the main advantages of the developed platform, making it particularly useful for several target groups of patients that require different screening methods.

635888,2021 Update on the Clinical Management and Diagnosis of Kawasaki Disease,2021-02-06,"While vaccines are vital for preventing COVID-19 infections, it is critical to develop new therapies to treat patients who become infected. Pharmacological targeting of a host factor required for viral replication can suppress viral spread with a low probability of viral mutation leading to resistance. In particular, host kinases are highly druggable targets and a number of conserved coronavirus proteins, notably the nucleoprotein (N), require phosphorylation for full functionality. In order to understand how targeting kinases could be used to compromise viral replication, we used a combination of phosphoproteomics and bioinformatics as well as genetic and pharmacological kinase inhibition to define the enzymes important for SARS-CoV-2 N protein phosphorylation and viral replication. From these data, we propose a model whereby SRPK1/2 initiates phosphorylation of the N protein, which primes for further phosphorylation by GSK-3α/β and CK1 to achieve extensive phosphorylation of the N protein SR-rich domain. Importantly, we were able to leverage our data to identify an FDA-approved kinase inhibitor, Alectinib, that suppresses N phosphorylation by SRPK1/2 and limits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Together, these data suggest that repurposing or developing novel host-kinase directed therapies may be an efficacious strategy to prevent or treat COVID-19 and other coronavirus-mediated diseases.","Yaron, Tomer M.; Heaton, Brook E.; Levy, Tyler M.; Johnson, Jared L.; Jordan, Tristan X.; Cohen, Benjamin M.; Kerelsky, Alexander; Lin, Ting-Yu; Liberatore, Katarina M.; Bulaon, Danielle K.; Kastenhuber, Edward R.; Mercadante, Marisa N.; Shobana-Ganesh, Kripa; He, Long; Schwartz, Robert E.; Chen, Shuibing; Weinstein, Harel; Elemento, Olivier; Piskounova, Elena; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E.; Lee, Gina; Trimarco, Joseph D.; Burke, Kaitlyn N.; Hamele, Cait E.; Chaparian, Ryan R.; Harding, Alfred T.; Tata, Aleksandra; Zhu, Xinyu; Tata, Purushothama Rao; Smith, Clare M.; Possemato, Anthony P.; Tkachev, Sasha L.; Hornbeck, Peter V.; Beausoleil, Sean A.; Anand, Shankara K.; Aguet, François; Getz, Gad; Davidson, Andrew D.; Heesom, Kate; Kavanagh-Williamson, Maia; Matthews, David; tenOever, Benjamin R.; Cantley, Lewis C.; Blenis, John; Heaton, Nicholas S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.14.251207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32817937/,133

Seeking a noninvasive method to conduct surveillance for respiratory pathogens, we sought to examine the usefulness of 2 types of off-the-shelf aerosol samplers to detect respiratory viruses in Singapore. METHODS. In this pilot study, we ran the aerosol samplers several times each week with patients present in the patient waiting areas at 3 primary health clinics during the months of April and May 2016. We used a SKC BioSampler with a BioLite Air Sampling Pump (run for 60 min at 8 L/min) and SKC AirChek TOUCH personal air samplers with polytetrafluoroethylene Teflon filter cassettes (run for 180 min at 5 L/min). The aerosol specimens and controls were studied with molecular assays for influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenoviruses, and coronaviruses. RESULTS. Overall, 16 (33.3%) of the 48 specimens indicated evidence of at least 1 respiratory pathogen, with 1 (2%) positive for influenza A virus, 3 (6%) positive for influenza B virus, and 12 (25%) positive for adenovirus. CONCLUSIONS. Although we were not able to correlate molecular detection with individual patient illness, patients with common acute respiratory illnesses were present during the samplings. Combined with molecular assays, it would suggest that aerosol sampling has potential as a noninvasive method for novel respiratory virus detection in clinical settings.","Nguyen, Tham T.; Poh, Mee K.; Low, Jenny; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Thoon, Koh C.; Ng, Wai C.; Anderson, Benjamin D.; Gray, Gregory C.",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofw259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28480252/,133

We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID‐19 children with different severities and allergic status. METHODS: Data extracted from the electronical medical records, including demographics, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, laboratory and immunological results and radiological images of 182 hospitalized COVID‐19 children were summarized and analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 6 years old, ranging from 3 days to 15 years, and there were more boys (male‐female ratio about 2:1) within the studied 182 patients. Most of the children were infected by family members. Fever (43.4%) and dry cough (44.5%) were common symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations accounted for 11.0%, including diarrhea, abdominal discomfort and vomiting. 71.4% had abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) scan images, and typical signs of pneumonia were ground‐glass opacity and local patchy shadowing on admission. Laboratory results were mostly within normal ranges, and only a small ratio of lymphopenia (3.9%) and eosinopenia (29.5%) were observed. The majority (97.8%) of infected children were not severe, and 24 (13.2%) of them had asymptomatic infections. Compared to children without pneumonia(manifested as asymptomatic and acute upper respiratory infection), children with pneumonia were associated with higher percentages of the comorbidity history, symptoms of fever and cough, and increased levels of serum procalcitonin, alkaline phosphatase and serum interleukins (IL)‐2, IL‐4, IL‐6, IL‐10 and TNF‐α.There were no differences of treatments, duration of hospitalization, time from first positive to first negative nucleic acid testing and outcomes between children with mild pneumonia and without pneumonia. All the hospitalized COVID‐19 children had recovered except one death due to intussusception and sepsis. In 43 allergic children with COVID‐19, allergic rhinitis (83.7%) was the major disease, followed by drug allergy, atopic dermatitis, food allergy and asthma. Demographics and clinical features were not significantly different between allergic and non‐allergic groups. Allergic patients showed less increase in acute phase reactants, procalcitonin, D‐dimer and aspartate aminotransferase levels compared to all patients. Immunological profiles including circulating T, B and NK lymphocyte subsets, total immunoglobulin and complement levels and serum cytokines did not show any difference in allergic and pneumonia groups. Neither eosinophil counts nor serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels showed a significant correlation with other immunological measures, such as other immunoglobulins, complements, lymphocyte subsets numbers and serum cytokine levels. CONCLUSION: Pediatric COVID‐19 patients tended to have a mild clinical course. Patients with pneumonia had higher proportion of fever and cough and increased inflammatory biomarkers than those without pneumonia. There was no difference between allergic and non‐allergic COVID‐19 children in disease incidence, clinical features, laboratory and immunological findings. Allergy was not a risk factor for developing and severity of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and hardly influenced the disease course of COVID‐19 in children.","Du, Hui; Dong, Xiang; Zhang, Jin‐jin; Cao, Yi‐yuan; Akdis, Mubeccel; Huang, Pei‐qi; Chen, Hong‐wei; Li, Ying; Liu, Guang‐hui; Akdis, Cezmi A; Lu, Xiao‐xia; Gao, Ya‐dong",Allergy,https://doi.org/10.1111/all.14452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32524611/,133

637637,Patterns of influenza B circulation in Brazil and its relevance to seasonal vaccine composition(),2015-11-25,"Introduction: In patients with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 infection elevated D-dimers are associated with a poor prognosis. Although suggestive of DIC, the majority of patients do not fulfil ISTH criteria for DIC. Studies have demonstrated that when compared to D-dimer, fibrin monomers are more sensitive and specific when differentiating overt DIC from non-overt DIC. Our special coagulation laboratory (SCL) routinely measures soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC) as part of our DIC profile in samples with elevated D-dimers. Here we aimed to investigate the percentage of patients with COVID-19 infection with elevated SFMC as performed as part of the DIC profile. Methods: Between April 1st 2020 and July 26, 2020 inpatients at the Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN campus with COVID-19 infection who underwent DIC testing in SCL were identified through SCL database. Patients were excluded if SARS-CoV2 PCR results were not available in the Mayo Clinic electronic medical record (EMR). DIC profile components include prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen and D-dimer. Reflex SFMC is performed if D-dimer is elevated. Data abstracted from EMR included results of laboratory tests, date of COVID-19 symptom onset, date of SARS-CoV2 PCR positivity, and death within 30 days of hospital admission. The ISTH DIC score was calculated and patients were labeled as overt DIC or non-overt DIC based off of ISTH DIC score ≥5. Results: 35 patients (19 female), median age 59 years (28-91) met our study criteria DIC profiles were obtained 6.5 (1-37) days after COVID-19 symptom onset (n=33) with 28 obtained within 14 days of symptom onset. Time to DIC profile from SARS-CoV2 PCR testing was 4 (0-37) days (n=35) with 31 having testing completed within 14 days of PCR positivity. 8 patients were intubated during hospitalization and of the remaining 27, 67% required supplemental oxygen. 21/35 (60%) patients had an elevated fibrinogen (526.5 mg/dL (201-800)) while 19/35 (54%) had a prolonged PT (12.8 seconds (10.1-99.6) and 5/35 (14%) had a prolonged APTT (31 seconds (24-68)). 17 patients with prolonged PT and 3 patients with prolonged APTT had factor activity assays performed (Figure 1A). 9/35 (25%) had thrombocytopenia (230 x 109/L (12-709) and 27/35 (77%) patients had an elevated D-dimer (895 ng/ml FEU (220- >100,000). D-dimer was higher in males than in females (p: 0.049). Of those with elevated D-dimer only 5/27 (18.5%) had an elevated SFMC (5 mcg/ml (5- >1100) (Figure 1B). 4/35 (11%) patients had ISTH DIC scores ≥ 5 and all had score of 5. All of these patients had D-dimer > 2000 ng/ml while only 2 had elevated SFMC however SFMC in both of these patients was < 15 mcg/ml. Of these, one patient with SFMC of 12 mcg/ml had known cirrhosis and the other with an SFMC of 11 mcg/ml had acute decompensation and associated shock liver. This patient also had venous thrombosis 3 days prior to DIC profile and died from complications related to COVID-19 infection. Of the two other patients with high ISTH score and normal SFMC, one had previous chronic thrombocytopenia of < 50 x109/L while the other had concomitant admission for acute and recurrent pancreatitis in the setting of alcoholism with acute intoxication. Six patients died within 30 days of admission and in 2/5 performed SFMC was elevated (Figure1C). Conclusion: Compared to 77% of patients with elevated D-dimers, of those tested only 18.5 % of patients had elevated SFMC. It has been hypothesized that the elevated D-dimer noted in COVID-19 pulmonary infection is a direct consequence of acute lung injury and not overt DIC. Although preliminary, the small percentage of patients with overt DIC by ISTH criteria and normal SFMC in the majority of the current cohort support this hypothesis; however studies in a larger more controlled cohort are needed to confirm these findings.

When the pandemic necessitated elimination of on-campus programming at Mayo Clinic, a new program was developed for remote delivery. Summer Foundations in Research (SFIR) was drafted around 4 aims: 1) support the academic trajectory gap in research science created by COVID-19; 2) build sustainable scientific relationships with mentors, peers, and the community; 3) create opportunities for participants to share and address concerns with their own experiences in the pandemic; and 4) provide support for individual wellbeing. SFIR included research training, but also training in communication through generative Dialogue and resilience through Amit Sood’s SMART program. 170 participants were followed for outcomes in these spaces. Knowledge of and interest in careers involving biomedical research rose significantly following SFIR. Participants’ mean confidence levels in 12 Key areas of research rose between 0.08 to 1.32 points on a 7-point scale. The strongest gains in mean confidence levels were seen in designing a study and collaborating with others. SFIR participants demonstrated gains in perceived happiness, and measured resilience and a reduction in stress. Participants’ qualitative responses indicated exceptionally positive mentor relationships and specific benefit of both the SMART program and Dialogue.","Yowler, Joanna Yang; Knier, Kit; WareJoncas, Zachary; Ehlers, Shawna L.; Ekker, Stephen C.; Reyes, Fabiola Guasp; Horazdovsky, Bruce F.; Mueller, Glenda; Gomez, Adriana Morales; Sood, Amit; Sussman, Caroline R.; Scholl, Linda M.; Weavers, Karen M.; Pierret, Chris",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.24.432694; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33655246/,133
640629,Asthma in Children and Adolescents: A Comprehensive Approach to Diagnosis and Management,2011-03-29,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the psychological well-being of students. Several stressors (such as socioeconomic and education-related contexts) could influence mental health, as well as individual and relational dimensions. This study proposes to evaluate the predictive effect of these factors on anxiety and depressive symptoms among students in higher education one year after the beginning of the pandemic. A sample of 23,307 students (Mage = 20.89; SD = 1.96; 69.08% of women) was assessed through an online self-report questionnaire including adapted and validated measures. The main rates were as follows: 50.6% of students presented anxiety symptoms; 55.1% reported depressive symptoms; 20.8% manifested suicidal ideations; 42.4% saw their financial situation deteriorate; 39.1% felt they were dropping out of school. One year after the beginning of the pandemic, students in higher education are anxious and depressed, especially those who identify as women (for both anxiety and depression) and as a non-binary gender (only for anxiety), experience a deterioration in their financial situation, are dropping out of school, or manifest hostility (for both anxiety and depression). The degree of study affects the symptoms’ severity (Bachelor 2 and 3 for anxiety and Master for depression). Contact with family and friends (for both anxiety and depression) as well as regular physical activity (only for depression) should provide some protection against psychological distress. Policy-makers must make a long-term investment in the well-being and positive mental health of the student community.","Schmits, Emilie; Dekeyser, Sarah; Klein, Olivier; Luminet, Olivier; Yzerbyt, Vincent; Glowacz, Fabienne",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299896/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147445,133

We compared the seroreactivity of specific pathogen-free (SPF) cat sera, sera from SPF cats inoculated with either FIV or FFV, and field isolates (e.g., shelter or privately owned cats). Sera from SPF cats experimentally infected with the cognate virus had significantly lower background in both FIV and FFV ELISAs compared to sera from negative field isolates. ELISA values for SPF cats exposed to either FIV or FFV tended to have higher OD values on the opposite ELISA antigen plate. FIV nonspecific background absorbance was greater than that of FFV, and 10 of 15 sera samples from FIV seronegative field samples were measured in the indeterminant range. These findings highlight that exposure to off-target pathogens elicit antibodies that may nonspecifically bind to antigens used in binding assays; therefore, validation using sera from SPF animals exposed during controlled infection results in the setting of a cutoff value that may be inappropriately low when applied to field samples. Our work also suggests that infection of domestic cats with pathogens other than FIV results in antibodies that cross-react with the FIV Gag antigen.","Moskaluk, Alex; Nehring, Mary; VandeWoude, Sue",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10060665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071706/,133

643432,The Role of Plant-Based Protein Functional Food in Preventing Acute Respiratory Disease: A Case Study,2021-06-20,"The emergence and continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 have resulted in a public health emergency across the globe. The lack of knowledge on the precise mechanism of viral pathogenesis is impeding medical intervention. In this study, we have taken both in silico and in vitro experimental approaches to unravel the mechanism of viral pathogenesis associated with complement and coagulation pathways. Based on the structural similarities of viral and host proteins, we initially generated a protein-protein interactome profile. Further computational analysis combined with Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and KEGG pathway analysis predicted key annotated pathways associated with viral pathogenesis. These include MAPK signaling, complement, and coagulation cascades, endocytosis, PD-L1 expression, PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathways. Degree centrality analysis pinned down to MAPK1, MAPK3, AKT1, and SRC are crucial drivers of signaling pathways and often overlap with the associated pathways. Most strikingly, the complement and coagulation cascade and platelet activation pathways are interconnected, presumably directing thrombotic activity observed in severe or critical cases of COVID-19. This is complemented by in vitro studies of Huh7 cell infection and analysis of the transcriptome and proteomic profile of gene candidates during viral infection. The most known candidates associated with complement and coagulation cascade signaling by KEGG pathway analysis showed significant up-regulated fold change during viral infection. Collectively both in silico and in vitro studies suggest complement and coagulation cascade signaling are a mechanism for intravascular coagulation, thrombotic changes, and associated complications in severe COVID-19 patients.","Tiwari, Ritudhwaj; Mishra, Anurag R.; Mikaeloff, Flora; Gupta, Soham; Mirazimi, Ali; Byrareddy, Siddappa N.; Neogi, Ujjwal; Nayak, Debasis",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.11.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2001037020304724; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037020304724?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33200027/,133

To gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between climate change and children and youth’s mental health, we conducted a rapid review and a thematic analysis of the results in NVivo 12. Our findings show that children and youth experience a plethora of direct and indirect effects from climate change and this impacts their mental wellbeing in diverse and complex ways. Young people also have varied perceptions of climate change based on their social locations and many are dealing with feelings of immense worry and eco-anxiety. The mental health impacts of climate change on children/youth are tied to Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) but also need to be understood in relation to the Ecological Determinants of Health (EDoH).

METHODS: We draw upon current events, academic literature, and numerous data sources to illustrate how biopsychosocial factors place older adults at higher risk for COVID-19 relative to younger adults, and how structural racism magnifies these risks for older Black and Latinx adults. RESULTS: We identify three proximate mechanisms through which structural racism operates as a fundamental cause of racial/ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 burden among older adults: (1) Risk of exposure; (2) Weathering processes; and (3) Health care access and quality. DISCUSSION: While the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented crisis, the racial/ethnic health inequalities among older adults it has exposed are long-standing and deeply rooted in structural racism within American society. This knowledge presents both challenges and opportunities for researchers and policymakers as they seek to address the needs of older adults. It is imperative that federal, state, and local governments collect and release comprehensive data on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths by race/ethnicity and age to better gauge the impact of outbreak across minority communities. We conclude with a discussion of incremental steps to be taken to lessen the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 among older Black and Latinx adults, as well as the need for transformative actions that address structural racism in order to achieve population health equity.","Garcia, Marc A; Homan, Patricia A; García, Catherine; Brown, Tyson H",J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32756973/; https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa114,133

As found in adults, signs and symptoms related to the disease mainly involve the respiratory tract in the paediatric population. However, a considerable number of children present with gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The purpose of this review is an accurate description, from pathogenesis to clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment, of COVID-19 effects on the gastrointestinal system at a paediatric age. SARS-CoV-2 can be identified in stool specimens of affected children by real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques. Positivity can last for several weeks after the end of the symptomatic phase. Gastrointestinal signs and symptoms are generally self-limited, can correlate with blood tests and imaging alterations, and may require supportive treatment such as hydration. However, they can precede severe disease manifestations such as the COVID-19-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Children belonging to risk categories such as those affected by celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and hepatic disease seem to not have a more severe course than the others, even if they are undergoing immunosuppressant treatment. Medical follow-ups of patients with chronic diseases need to be revised during the pandemic period in order to postpone unnecessary tests, mainly endoscopic ones.","Calitri, Carmelina; Fumi, Ilaria; Ignaccolo, Maria Giovanna; Banino, Elena; Benetti, Stefania; Lupica, Maria Maddalena; Fantone, Francesca; Pace, Mariella; Garofalo, Franco",World J Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34163113/; https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v27.i23.3303,133

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between emotional intelligence and occupational boredom in nurses working in both public (52.9%) and private (47.1%) health units in Greece. A cross-sectional study was conducted among a convenience sample of 189 nurses (84.7% females) with an average age of 40 years. Emotional intelligence was evaluated with the use of The Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form and Professional boredom was assessed with the use of the Boredom Proneness Scale. The majority of Nurses showed relatively high values of total Emotional Intelligence (EI), and marginally low values of overall Professional Boredom. A statistically significant negative correlation was found between the overall Professional Boredom of Nurses and the Well-being, Self-control, Emotionality and Sociability subscales of EI, as well as total EI (p < 0.001). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that the three dimensions of EI (Well-being, Self-Control and Emotionality) explained 39.0% of the variability of the total Professional Boredom of the working Nurses.","Papathanasiou, Ioanna V.; Fradelos, Evangelos C.; Nikolaou, Eleftheria; Tsaras, Konstantinos; Kontopoulou, Lamprini; Malli, Foteini",J Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442394/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11080750,133

We built a real-time smartwatch-based alerting system for the detection of aberrant physiological and activity signals (e.g. resting heart rate, steps) associated with early infection onset at the individual level. Upon applying this system to a cohort of 3,246 participants, we found that alerts were generated for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 infections in 78% of cases, and pre-symptomatic signals were observed a median of three days prior to symptom onset. Furthermore, by examining over 100,000 survey annotations, we found that other respiratory infections as well as events not associated with COVID-19 (e.g. stress, alcohol consumption, travel) could trigger alerts, albeit at a lower mean period (1.9 days) than those observed in the COVID-19 cases (4.3 days). Thus this system has potential both for advanced warning of COVID-19 as well as a general system for measuring health via detection of physiological shifts from personal baselines. The system is open-source and scalable to millions of users, offering a personal health monitoring system that can operate in real time on a global scale.","Alavi, Arash; Bogu, Gireesh K; Wang, Meng; Rangan, Ekanath Srihari; Brooks, Andrew W; Wang, Qiwen; Higgs, Emily; Celli, Alessandra; Mishra, Tejaswini; Metwally, Ahmed A.; Cha, Kexin; Knowles, Peter; Alavi, Amir A; Bhasin, Rajat; Panchamukhi, Shrinivas; Celis, Diego; Aditya, Tagore; Honkala, Alexander; Rolnik, Benjamin; Hunting, Erika; Dagan-Rosenfeld, Orit; Chauhan, Arshdeep; Li, Jessi W; Li, Xiao; Bahmani, Amir; Snyder, Michael P",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.13.21258795; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.13.21258795v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189532/,133

Respiratory symptoms and flu-like presentation are the most defined clinical manifestations. However, gastrointestinal symptoms with acute abdomen have been reported in a small percentage, occasionally mimicking acute appendicitis. Hence, the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be suspected and investigated in every case of acute abdomen in the present situation. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 25-year-old male who presented with features of acute appendicitis. Despite the equivocal ultrasound results, he was scheduled for an emergency appendectomy for Alvarado's score 7 out of 10, who underwent a successful appendectomy. The patient had initially tested negative on an upper respiratory COVID-19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with normal chest X-ray but few hours after the surgery patient developed a high-grade fever. An RT-PCR for COVID-19 was resent following a suspicion that came out to be positive. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Several case reports have suggested a probable association between COVID-19 and appendicitis. This case shows the limited effectiveness of clinical diagnosis for the surgical abdomen in COVID-19 patients as these two conditions share similar symptoms often needing a clinical vigilance. CONCLUSION: This case reports acute appendicitis in a patient who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 subsequently following emergency appendectomy highlighting the acute gastrointestinal presentation of COVID-19. This case exemplifies the necessity to be familiar with the gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 and maintain a high level of suspicion for COVID-19 infection in cases of abdominal pain.","Malbul, Kiran; Katwal, Srijana; Maharjan, Swojay; Shrestha, Suraj; Dhital, Roman; Rajbhandari, Ashish Prasad",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080121006695; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080121006695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34422263/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102719,133

This study sought to illuminate young people’s experiences of accessing and using condoms and contraception in the early months of the pandemic. METHODS: We analysed data, including open-text responses, from an online survey conducted in June–July 2020 with a convenience sample of 2005 16–24-year-olds living in Scotland. RESULTS: Among those who used condoms and contraception, one quarter reported that COVID-19 mitigation measures had made a difference to their access or use. Open-text responses revealed a landscape of disrupted prevention, including changes to sexual risk-taking and preventive practices, unwanted contraceptive pathways, unmet need for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, and switches from freely provided to commercially sold condoms and contraception. Pandemic-related barriers to accessing free condoms and contraception included: (1) uncertainty about the legitimacy of accessing SRH care and self-censorship of need; (2) confusion about differences between SRH care and advice received from healthcare professionals during the pandemic compared with routine practice; and (3) exacerbation of existing access barriers, alongside reduced social support and resources to navigate SRH care. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging barriers to STI and pregnancy prevention within the context of COVID-19 have the potential to undermine positive SRH practices, and widen inequalities, among young people. As SRH services are restored amid evolving pandemic restrictions, messaging to support navigation of condom and contraception services should be co-created with young people.","Lewis, Ruth; Blake, Carolyn; Shimonovich, Michal; Coia, Nicky; Duffy, Johann; Kerr, Yvonne; Wilson, Jill; Graham, Cynthia Ann; Mitchell, Kirstin R",BMJ Sex Reprod Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsrh-2020-200975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33707178/,133

Using Egypt as a case study, this paper presents the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on air pollution levels by studying nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), ozone (O(3)), particulate matter represented in absorbing aerosol index (AAI), carbon monoxide (CO), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The paper also highlights the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on other environmental indicators including environmental noise, medical and municipal solid wastes. The paper presents the Egyptian COVID-19 story from its different angles including the development of confirmed COVID-19 cases, containment measures from the government, the impact on the country’s economy and the national energy consumption so as to effectively evaluate the effect on both the air pollution levels and the other studied environmental indicators. For the other environmental indicators, a strong link was observed between COVID-19 lockdown and the reduction in environmental noise, beaches, surface and groundwater pollution. For environmental noise, this has been confirmed by officially governmental announcements which reported that the level of environmental noise in Egypt was reduced by about 75% during the lockdown period. On the other hand, there are some negative effects, including an increase in medical solid waste (from 70 to 300 ton/day), municipal solid waste, as well as a less efficient solid waste recycling process. For air pollution levels, the data were obtained from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency satellite data sets. The data for the lockdown period in 2020 have been extracted and compared to the corresponding months in the selected baseline period (2015-2019) to identify the effect that the lockdown period had on the air pollution levels in Egypt with focus on Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It was found that the AAI decreased by about 30%, the NO(2) decreased by 15 and 33% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates, respectively, and that the CO decreased by about 5% over both governorates. In addition, the GHG emissions in Egypt were reduced by at least 4% during the pandemic. In contrast, ozone levels increased by about 2% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It can be concluded that the implemented containment measures during COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in both positive and negative environmental impacts. The positive environmental impacts are not sustainable and deterioration on them is expected to occur after the lockdown as it was before the pandemic.

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is projected to carry the largest burden of diabetes (34.2 million) by 2030. This will inevitably cause a parallel increase in diabetes-associated complications; with the predominant complications being blindness due to diabetic retinopathy and diabetic cataracts. Eye programs in developing countries remain inadequate, existing as stand-alone programs, focused on the provision of acute symptomatic care at secondary and tertiary health levels. Over 60% of people with undiagnosed diabetes report to eye care facilities with already advanced retinopathy. While vision loss due to cataracts is reversible, loss of vision from diabetic retinopathy is irreversible. Developing countries have in the last two decades been significantly impacted by infectious pandemics; with SSA countries committing over 80% of their health budgets towards infectious diseases. Consequently, non-communicable diseases and eye health have been neglected. This paper aimed to highlight the importance of strengthening primary health care services to prevent diabetes-related blindness. In SSA, where economies are strained by infectious disease, the projected rise in diabetes prevalence calls for an urgent need to reorganize health systems to focus on life-long preventative and integrated measures.

Secondary objectives were to identify whether particular clinical and/or sociodemographic factors were associated with occupational disruptions and to assess the impact of rehabilitation approaches on leisure and productivity in this population. METHODS: A systematic review of the 2009-2019 literature performed on Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. RESULTS: 1471 publications were retrieved: 48 full texts were assessed; seven of these (four cross-sectional studies, two cohort studies, and a case report) were reviewed, including data on 16668 people (12649 healthy controls, 3918 cancer survivors, and 101 ill patients). Older adults with comorbidities and a low level of activity before cancer diagnosis may be more at risk of occupational disruptions. However, studies focused more on physical activity than leisure and productivity. Two studies mentioned occupational therapy. Discussion. As cancer can become a chronic disease, it appears important to also offer occupation-centred assessments and follow-up. CONCLUSION: An occupation-centred approach could be developed; its effectiveness must be assessed.","Engels, Cynthia; Bairet, Robin; Canoui-Poitrine, Florence; Laurent, Marie",Occup Ther Int,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8886193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33880113/,133

652503,Mesh hernioplasty in emergency repair of traumatic abdominal wall hernia following bull horn injury,2021,"Cellular immunity may be involved in organ damage and rehabilitation in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to delineate immunological features of COVID-19 patients with pulmonary sequelae (PS) one year after discharge. 50 COVID-19 survivors were recruited and classified according to radiological characteristics: 24 patients with PS and 26 patients without PS. Phenotypic and functional characteristics of immune cells were evaluated by multiparametric flow cytometry. Patients with PS had an increased proportion of natural killer (NK) cells and lower percentage of B cells compared to patients without PS. Phenotypic and functional features of T cells in patients with PS were predominated by the accumulation of CD4+ T cells secreting IL-17A, short-lived effector-like CD8+ T cells (CD27-CD62L-) and senescent T cells with excessive secretion of granzyme-B/perforin/IFN-γ. NK cells were characterized by the excessive secretion of granzyme-B and perforin and the downregulation of NKP30 and NKP46; highly activated NKT and γδ T cells exhibited NKP30 and TIM-3 upregulation and NKB1 downregulation in patients with PS. However, immunosuppressive cells were comparable between the two groups. The interrelation of immune cells in COVID-19 was intrinsically identified, whereby T cells secreting IL-2, IL-4 and IL-17A were enriched among CD28+ and CD57-cells and cells secreting perforin/granzyme-B/IFN-γ/TNF-α expressed markers of terminal differentiation. CD57+NK cells, CD4+perforin+ T cells and CD8+CD27+CD62L+ T cells were identified as the independent predictors for residual lesions. Overall, our findings unveil the profound imbalance of immune landscape that may correlate with organ damage and rehabilitation in COVID-19. IMPORTANCE A considerable proportion of COVID-19 survivors have residual lung lesions, such as ground glass opacity and fiber streak shadow. To determine the relationship between host immunity and residual lung lesions, we performed an extensive analysis of immune responses in convalescent patients with COVID-19 one year after discharge. We found significant differences in immunological characteristics between patients with pulmonary sequelae and patients without pulmonary sequelae one year after discharge. Our study highlights the profound imbalance of immune landscape in the COVID-19 patients with pulmonary sequelae, characterized by the robust activation of cytotoxic T cells, NK cells and γδ T cells as well as the deficiencies of immunosuppressive cells. Importantly, CD57+NK cells, CD4+perforin+ T cells and CD8+CD27+CD62L+ T cells were identified as the independent predictors for residual lesions.","Wu, Jianghua; Tang, Lu; Ma, Yanling; Li, Yu; Zhang, Dongmei; Li, Qian; Mei, Heng; Hu, Yu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.03.447023,133

653448,The effect of Co-Q10 on allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma,2021-03-20,"Abstract BST-2 is an antiviral protein described as a powerful cross-species transmission barrier for simian immunodeficiency viruses. Influenza viruses appear to interact with BST-2, raising the possibility that BST-2 may be a barrier for cross-species transmission. An MDCK-based cell line expressing human BST-2 was generated to study human-derived A/Puerto Rico/8/36 (H1N1; PR8) as well as two low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (subtypes H4N6 and H6N1). The H4N6 and H6N1 viruses were less affected by BST-2 expression than PR8, due to their ability to decrease BST-2 levels, a function localized to the PA segment of both avian viruses. Experiments with PA-mutant and -chimeric viruses confirmed that the avian PA segment conferred BST-2 downregulation and antagonism. These results indicate a species-specific ability of PA from low pathogenic avian viruses to mitigate human BST-2 antiviral activity, suggesting that BST-2 is unlikely to be a general cross-species barrier to transmission of such viruses to humans.","Narkpuk, Jaraspim; Jongkaewwattana, Anan; Teeravechyan, Samaporn",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2018.09.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682218302952; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30290311/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682218302952,133
653649,Disinfection of N95 respirators by ionized hydrogen peroxide during pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2,2020-04-08,"AIM: The research aimed to study the effect of interferon (IFN)-based drugs on the behavior of immunological parameters in calves during the specific prevention of associative infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The object of research was 45 black motley cows and their calves from birth to 2 months of life. Serum and colostrum samples were screened for antibodies against Rotavirus, diarrhea, and coronavirus using serological methods. The testing was performed before vaccination, 40 days before calving, 20 days before calving, and before calving. Colostrum samples were taken during the first milk yield. Serum samples from calves were drawn before colostrum feeding as well as at 7, 14, and 21 days, and 1 and 2 months of age. To measure the level of immunoglobulins A, M, and G, additional serum samples were collected from calves at 25, 35, 65, and 75 days after birth. RESULTS: Giving pregnant cows, an IFN-based drug at a dose of 1 ml/kg 48 h before vaccination results in the development and accumulation of antibodies to Rotavirus, coronavirus, and viral diarrhea (VD) in the colostrum, with a titer of 7.6±0.3 log(2), 5.8±0.34 log(2), and 4.4±0.18 log(2), respectively. It indicates an increase in the antigenic activity of the multivalent vaccine. CONCLUSION: IFN-based drugs enhance the protective effect of vaccination against associative infections in the newborn calves. They stimulate a rise in the titer of antibodies to Rotavirus, coronavirus, VD, and mucosal disease complex as well as an increase in immunoglobulins A, M, and G.","Andreeva, Alfia; Nikolaeva, Oksana; Altynbekov, Oleg; Galieva, Chulpan; Ilina, Kseniia",Vet World,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32255964/; https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2020.238-244,133
653969,Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in international travelers,2021-07-15,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, thousands of scientists around the globe have changed research direction to understand better how the virus works and to find out how it may be tackled. The number of manuscripts on preprint servers is soaring and peer-reviewed publications using MS-based proteomics are beginning to emerge. To facilitate proteomic research on SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, this report presents deep-scale proteomes (10,000 proteins; >130,000 peptides) of common cell line models, notably Vero E6, Calu-3, Caco-2, and ACE2-A549 that characterize their protein expression profiles including viral entry factors such as ACE2 or TMPRSS2. Using the 9 kDa protein SRP9 and the breast cancer oncogene BRCA1 as examples, we show how the proteome expression data can be used to refine the annotation of protein-coding regions of the African green monkey and the Vero cell line genomes. Monitoring changes of the proteome on viral infection revealed widespread expression changes including transcriptional regulators, protease inhibitors, and proteins involved in innate immunity. Based on a library of 98 stable-isotope labeled synthetic peptides representing 11 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we developed PRM (parallel reaction monitoring) assays for nano-flow and micro-flow LC–MS/MS. We assessed the merits of these PRM assays using supernatants of virus-infected Vero E6 cells and challenged the assays by analyzing two diagnostic cohorts of 24 (+30) SARS-CoV-2 positive and 28 (+9) negative cases. In light of the results obtained and including recent publications or manuscripts on preprint servers, we critically discuss the merits of MS-based proteomics for SARS-CoV-2 research and testing.","Zecha, Jana; Lee, Chien-Yun; Bayer, Florian P.; Meng, Chen; Grass, Vincent; Zerweck, Johannes; Schnatbaum, Karsten; Michler, Thomas; Pichlmair, Andreas; Ludwig, Christina; Kuster, Bernhard",Mol Cell Proteomics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947620350994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32591346/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1535947620350994; https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.ra120.002164,133

METHODS: This web‐based survey was conducted from April 14 to May 6, 2020, in Japan and included HCWs directly involved in ICU management of COVID‐19 patients. A survey invitation was emailed using the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine’s mailing list. RESULTS: We analyzed 460 valid responses from among 976 responses. The N95/FFP2 mask (77%) was most frequently used than in the international study, although half of our respondents reported reuse of single‐use N95/FFP2 masks. The median duration (1 hour) of uninterrupted PPE use per shift was less than that in the international study. The commonest PPE‐related adverse event was experiencing intense heat (75%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that being a nurse was independently associated with experiencing intense heat. CONCLUSION: PPE shortage and frequent mask reuse were prevalent during the COVID‐19 pandemic in Japan. Intense heat is the most significant symptom, especially for nurses, even with short‐duration PPE use. Strategies to protect HCWs from dehydration and intense heat stroke are needed.","Unoki, Takeshi; Tamoto, Mitsuhiro; Ouchi, Akira; Sakuramoto, Hideaki; Nakayama, Asami; Katayama, Yukiko; Miyazaki, Satoko; Yamada, Toru; Fujitani, Shigeki; Nishida, Osamu; Tabah, Alexis",Acute Med Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042559/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ams2.584,133

Yet, there has been an ongoing decline in the number of those applying to study the subject. There is limited literature associated with this topic and we sought to explore the factors that attract ‘generation Z’ (those born 1995–2010) to a potential career in podiatry. METHOD: A qualitative design framework underpinned by phenomenological principles used four focus groups over a two-year period to generate data from participants at University and in Further Education. Focus group conversations were led by external facilitator, recorded, independently transcribed verbatim and anonymised prior to thematic analysis. This was followed by external, independent verification of themes. RESULTS: Four main themes were determined from the analysis i) a lack of awareness of podiatry; ii) podiatry: accessible course, accessible career; iii) career status; iv) breadth/opportunity of the scope of practice. Both positive and negative experiences were reported and highlighted key gaps in how the attractiveness of a career in podiatry is portrayed. CONCLUSION: The chronic lack of awareness of podiatry as a career clearly needs to be addressed, ideally with more positive role modelling in mainstream and popular media. The career status offered together with the breadth of, and opportunity associated with, the scope of practice should continue to be celebrated.

657066,mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is well tolerated in patients with cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis with mast cell activation symptoms and anaphylaxis,2021-01-19,"The ability to comprehensively characterize exposures and immune responses to viral infections will be critical to better understanding human health and disease. We previously described the VirScan system, a phage-display based technology for profiling antibody binding to a comprehensive library of peptides designed to represent the human virome. The previous VirScan analytical approach did not fully account for disproportionate representation of viruses in the library or for antibody cross-reactivity among sequences shared by related viruses. Here we present the ‘AntiViral Antibody Response Deconvolution Algorithm’ (‘AVARDA’), a multi-module software package for analyzing VirScan datasets. AVARDA provides a probabilistic assessment of infection at species-level resolution by considering alignment of all library peptides to each other and to all human viruses. We employed AVARDA to analyze VirScan data from a cohort of encephalitis patients with either known viral infections or undiagnosed etiologies. By comparing acute and convalescent sera, AVARDA successfully confirmed or detected antibody responses to human herpesviruses 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, thereby improving the rate of diagnosing viral encephalitis in this cohort by 62.5%. We further assessed AVARDA’s utility in the setting of an epidemiological study, demonstrating its ability to determine infections acquired in a child followed prospectively from infancy. We consider ways in which AVARDA’s conceptual framework may be further developed in the future and describe how its analyses may be extended beyond investigations of viral infection. AVARDA, in combination with VirScan and other pan-pathogen serological techniques, is likely to find broad utility in the epidemiology and diagnosis of infectious diseases.","Monaco, Daniel R.; Kottapalli, Sanjay V.; Yuan, Tiezheng; Breitwieser, Florian P.; Anderson, Danielle E.; Wijaya, Limin; Tan, Kevin; Chia, Wan Ni; Kammers, Kai; Caturegli, Mario; Waugh, Kathleen; Rewers, Marian; Wang, Lin-Fa; Benjamin Larman, H.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/333625,133
659218,High Titers of IgE Antibody to Dust Mite Allergen and the Risk for Wheezing Among Asthmatic Children Infected with Rhinovirus,2012-06-01,"BACKGROUND: Homeless youth experience high rates of substance use disorders, exposures to violence, mental and physical health conditions, and mortality. They have been particularly affected by the opioid crisis. However, no study to date has used a randomized controlled design to test preventive interventions of opioid and other drug use among this vulnerable population. Resolution of youth homelessness through housing and supportive services including prevention services, often referred to as “Housing First,” has great potential to reduce the likelihood for the development of an opioid use disorder as well as other problem behaviors associated with living on the streets. Housing First has been tested through randomized trials among homeless adults with mental health and substance use disorders, but has not been empirically tested for opioid prevention among homeless youth. METHODS: Homeless youth will be recruited from a drop-in shelter site frequented by disconnected youth; they will be screened for eligibility, including current homelessness, age 18–24 years, and not currently meeting criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). In a controlled trial, 240 youth will then be randomized to one of two conditions, (1) housing + opioid and related risk prevention services, or (2) opioid and related risk prevention services alone. This project utilizes existing efficacious models of prevention to address opioid-related risks, including motivational interviewing, strengths-based outreach and advocacy, and an HIV risk preventive intervention. Follow-up will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and 12-months post-baseline. The economic cost of each intervention will be determined to support implementation decisions with other providers and their funders. DISCUSSION: This study will provide essential information for researchers and providers on the efficacy of housing + opioid and related risk prevention services in an RCT for effects on opioid use and mechanisms underlying change. Because youth experiencing homelessness are at increased risk for a variety of adverse outcomes, the proposed intervention may produce substantial health care benefits to the youths and society at large.

We collected data from nine clinicians at an academic Level 1 trauma center in New Jersey. We found that the silicone scar sheet resulted in the lowest adequate fit while Cavilon™ provided the highest fit factor when compared to other interventions (p<0.05).

The disease first struck in Brazil major cities, affecting high-income groups, subsequently spreading to the socially-vulnerable outlying areas. The objective of this preliminary study was to the estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in the Baixada Santista Metropolitan Area - RMBS, to inform policies for prevention and preparation of primary care, hospital services, hospital beds, intensive and critical care in a bid to reduce lethality. Methods: This study is the first of a four-phase cross-sectional survey to include all cities within the Baixada Santista metropolitan area. The probabilistic population-based sample was based on a 7% prevalence with a 2% delta, a 5% level of significance and 90% power, and considered the estimated population, stratified by age, gender and city. The sample was randomized in each city and street selection was based on data drawn from the 2010 Brazilian census. The serology test was chosen from the available test kits approved by the National Health Agency (ANS) of the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Information on socioeconomic characteristics, health service use, symptoms and adherence to social distancing measures was collected. All variables were expressed as absolute and relative frequencies and confidence intervals. Results: The final sample comprised 2,342 respondents with a mean age of 37.78 (19.98) years and equal gender distribution. Respondents predominantly lived in an abode with 4 or more rooms, 71.9% had an income of [â¤]3 minimum wages and no formal employment. Over half of the sample reported being reliant on the National Health Service (SUS) for health care, while 26.5% held private health insurance.

Methods A total of 262 COVID-19 patients were discharged from January 23 to February 25, 2020, and were enrolled for analysis of their clinical parameters. The RP and non-RP (NRP) patients were grouped according to the disease severity during their hospitalization period. The clinical characterization at re-admission to the hospital was analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and plasma antibody levels were detected using high-sensitive detection methods. Findings Up to March 10, 2020, all of patients were followed up for at least 14 days, and 38/262 of RP patients (14.5%) were present. The RP patients were characterized by being less than 14-years old and having mild and moderate conditions as compared to NRP patients, while no severe patients became RP. Retrospectively, the RP patients displayed fewer symptoms, more sustained remission of CT imaging and earlier RNA negative-conversion but similar plasma antibody levels during their hospitalization period as compared to those NRP patients. When re-admitted to the hospital, these RP patients showed no obvious clinical symptoms or disease progression indicated by normal or improving CT imaging and inflammatory cytokine levels. All 21 close contacts of RP patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and no suspicious clinical symptoms were reported. However, 18/24 of RNA-negative samples detected by the commercial kit were tested to be positive for virus RNA using a hyper-sensitive method, suggesting the carrier status of virus possibly existed in patients recovered from COVID-19. Interpretation Our results showed that young and mild COVID-19 patients seem to be RP patients after discharge, who show no obviously clinical symptoms and disease progression upon re-admission. More sensitive RNA detection methods are required to monitor these patients during follow-up. Our findings provide empirical information and evidence for the effective management of COVID-19 patients during their convalescent phase.","An, Jianghong; Liao, Xuejiao; Xiao, Tongyang; Qian, Shen; Yuan, Jing; Ye, Haocheng; Qi, Furong; Shen, Chengguang; Liu, Yang; Wang, Lifei; Cheng, Xiaoya; Li, Na; Cai, Qingxian; Wang, Fang; Chen, Jun; Liu, Yingxia; Wang, Yunfang; Zhang, Feng; Fu, Yang; Tan, Xiaohua; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Zheng",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044222,133

OBJECTIVE: We describe a collaborative project to establish the Texas Flood Registry to track the health and housing impacts of major flooding events. METHODS: Those who enroll in the registry answer retrospective questions regarding the impact of storms on their health and housing status. We recruit both those who did and did not flood during storm events to enable key comparisons. We leverage partnerships with multiple local health departments, community groups, and media outlets to recruit broadly. We performed a preliminary analysis using multivariable logistic regression and a binomial Bayesian conditional autoregressive (CAR) spatial model. RESULTS: We find that those whose homes flooded, or who came into direct skin contact with flood water, are more likely to experience a series of self-reported health effects. Median household income is inversely related to adverse health effects, and spatial analysis provides important insights within the modeling approach. SIGNIFICANCE: Global climate change is likely to increase the number and intensity of rainfall events, resulting in additional health burdens. Population-level data on the health and housing impacts of major flooding events is imperative in preparing for our planet’s future.","Miranda, Marie Lynn; Callender, Rashida; Canales, Joally M.; Craft, Elena; Ensor, Katherine B.; Grossman, Max; Hopkins, Loren; Johnston, Jocelyn; Shah, Umair; Tootoo, Joshua",J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34175888/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41370-021-00347-z,133

This protein assists viral polyprotein cleavage, host immune interference, and may play other roles in genome replication or transcription. Here, we report the solution NMR structure of a protein from the “SARS‐unique region” of the bat coronavirus HKU9. The protein contains a frataxin fold or double‐wing motif, which is an α + β fold that is associated with protein/protein interactions, DNA binding, and metal ion binding. High structural similarity to the human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus nsp3 is present. A possible functional site that is conserved among some betacoronaviruses has been identified using bioinformatics and biochemical analyses. This structure provides strong experimental support for the recent proposal advanced by us and others that the “SARS‐unique” region is not unique to the human SARS virus, but is conserved among several different phylogenetic groups of coronaviruses and provides essential functions.","Hammond, Robert G.; Tan, Xuan; Johnson, Margaret A.",Protein Science,https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.3208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28580734/; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pro.3208,133

669170,Poverty and infection in the developing world: Healthcare-related infections and infection control in the tropics,2007-10-22,"BACKGROUND: Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease in China, Japan, and Korea, which is characterized by high fever, thrombocytopenia, and high mortality. It is hypothesized that a cytokine storm plays an important role in the pathophysiology of SFTS. However, limited data have been published on the detailed kinetics of the viral load and cytokine profiles throughout the course of this disease. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the patterns of changes in cytokines and viral load in SFTS patients. STUDY DESIGN: During the admission period of patients, RNA was extracted from plasma and quantified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In addition, cytokine bead arrays were performed for the 18 cytokines and chemokines selected for testing. RESULTS: The median time from admission to the negative conversion of SFTS viremia was 17.0 days. When censored patients were found to be negative for viral load at discharge, the median duration of viral shedding was 13.0 days (95% CI, 5.4–20.6). Interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin (IL)-10, and IFN-γ-induced protein (IP)-10 concentrations significantly increased in the early course of disease and then decreased during the hospital stay. However, the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, IL-12p40, IL-13, IL-17A, Regulated on Activation and Normally T-cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increased during the late course of disease. Initial IP-10 levels during hospital days 1–4 were the most significantly correlated with initial viral load (r = 0.88, P < .01). CONCLUSION: SFTS viremia persisted until weeks 2–3 and was highly correlated with initial plasma IP-10 levels. In addition, IFN-α, IL-10, and IP-10 were associated with the initial cytokine storm in SFTS.","Kwon, Ji-Soo; Kim, Min-Chul; Kim, Ji Yeun; Jeon, Na-Young; Ryu, Byung-Han; Hong, Jeongmin; Kim, Min-Jae; Chong, Yong Pil; Lee, Sang-Oh; Choi, Sang-Ho; Kim, Yang Soo; Woo, Jun Hee; Kim, Sung-Han",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29427908/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653218300301; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.01.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653218300301,133

It was striking that many of the patients affected had only mild symptoms. In this case study it was investigated to what extent SARS-CoV‑2 can cause lung involvement even with minor symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study five outpatient radiological centers and two inpatient hospitals in North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Württemberg in Germany were involved. The retrospective analysis included outpatients with radiologically detected viral pneumonia, who were examined in March or April 2020. The clinical symptoms were divided into severity levels 1–5 using a simplified clinical score. The lung images were evaluated with respect to features specific for COVID-19 . The presence of a SARS-CoV‑2 infection was verified using PCR, antibody testing and/or typical computed tomography (CT) morphology. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients were included, all of whom had radiological signs of viral pneumonia. The majority had no or only few non-specific symptoms (26/50). This was followed by mild symptoms of a flu-like infection (17/50). Severe forms were rare in outpatients (7/50). Detection of COVID-19 was successful in 30/50 cases using PCR and in 4/50 cases using an antibody test. In 16/50 cases the diagnosis was based on typical CT criteria and on the typical COVID patient history. CONCLUSION: A SARS-CoV‑2 infection leads to lung involvement more often than previously assumed, namely not only in severely ill hospitalized patients but also in cases with only mild or even non-specific symptoms.","Palmowski, Moritz; Persigehl, Thorsten; Michaely, Henrik; Miller, Steffen; Grouls, Christoph; Nguyen, Hieu; Mühlenbruch, Georg",Radiologe,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00117-020-00746-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32886159/,133

673054,Systematic screening on admission for SARS-CoV-2 to detect asymptomatic infections,2021-02-27,"Inflammation is the physiologic reaction to cellular and tissue damage caused by pathologic processes including trauma, infection, and ischemia(1). Effective inflammatory responses integrate molecular and cellular functions to prevent further tissue damage, initiate repair, and restore homeostasis, while futile or dysfunctional responses allow escalating injury, delay recovery, and may hasten death(2). Elevation of white blood cell count (WBC) and altered levels of other acute phase reactants are cardinal signs of inflammation, but the dynamics of these changes and their resolution are not established(3,4). Patient responses appear to vary dramatically with no clearly defined signs of good prognosis, leaving physicians reliant on qualitative interpretations of laboratory trends(4,5). We retrospectively, observationally studied the human acute inflammatory response to trauma, ischemia, and infection by tracking the longitudinal dynamics of cellular and serum markers in hospitalized patients. Unexpectedly, we identified a conserved pattern of recovery defined by co-regulation of WBC and platelet (PLT) populations. Across all inflammatory conditions studied, recovering patients followed a consistent WBC-PLT trajectory shape that is well-approximated by exponential WBC decay and delayed linear PLT growth. This recovery trajectory shape may represent a fundamental archetype of human physiologic response at the cellular population scale, and provides a generic approach for identifying high-risk patients: 32x relative risk of adverse outcomes for cardiac surgery patients, 9x relative risk of death for COVID-19, and 5x relative risk of death for myocardial infarction.","Foy, Brody H; Sundt, Thor; Carlson, Jonathan C T; Aguirre, Aaron D; Higgins, John M",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.19.21259181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189534/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.19.21259181v1?rss=1,133

Public perceptions towards the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine,2010-04-19,"Although research has given ample consideration to the association between peer victimization and internalizing problems, little is known about the mediating and moderating influences on this relationship. This study investigated whether peer victimization at age 9 indirectly related to internalizing problems at age 15 via school connectedness and whether the direct and indirect associations between peer victimization and internalizing problems were moderated by race. Data were drawn from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, which included 2467 adolescents. The sample was equally divided between male and female and 82% identified as Black and Hispanic. Results indicated that the predictive effect of peer victimization over a 6-year period on teen depression and anxiety was explained by increased school connectedness. Furthermore, there was a moderating effect of race on the direct effect of school connectedness and teen depression and anxiety. For both White and ethnic minority youth, increased school connectedness was associated with less teen depression and anxiety. However, this effect was weaker for ethnic minority students in comparison to White students in both moderated mediation models. The moderated mediation results for teen anxiety showed a greater differential effect among race. The findings have important implications, which are discussed.","Eugene, Danielle R.; Crutchfield, Jandel; Robinson, Erica D.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33530481/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18031085,133

The consequences could be even more severe for those more vulnerable to the disease, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. Indeed, there is evidence that such vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected in terms of both, their health and the socioeconomic impact. The aim of our study was to determine whether occupational health (OH) professionals thought that the COVID-19 pandemic might further disadvantage any particular group(s) of vulnerable workers globally, and if so, which group(s). A cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample of OH professionals by means of an online questionnaire which was shared via email within the ICOH (International Commission for Occupational Health) community. Data was collected over a period of two weeks in May 2020 and 165 responses from 52 countries were received. In this paper, the responses relating to questions about vulnerable workers are reported and discussed. Globally, our responders felt that those in less secure jobs (precarious employment (79%) and informal work (69%)), or unemployed (63%), were the most at risk of further disadvantage from this pandemic. The majority felt that their governments could act to mitigate these effects. There were suggestions of short-term alleviation such as financial and social support, as well as calls for fundamental reviews of the underlying inequalities that leave populations so vulnerable to a crisis such as COVID-19.","Tamin, Jacques; Samuel, Oluranti; Suraya, Anna; Ebuenyi, Ikenna D.; Naicker, Nisha; Rajput-Ray, Minha",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18010346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33466436/,133

Since animal studies have shown that myocarditis is influenced by sex hormones, we hypothesized that endocrine disruptors, which interfere with natural hormones, may play a role in the progression of the disease. The human population is exposed to the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) from plastics, such as water bottles and plastic food containers. Methods: Male and female adult BALB/c mice were housed in plastic versus glass caging, or exposed to BPA in drinking water versus control water. Myocarditis was induced with coxsackievirus B3 on day 0, and the endpoints were assessed on day 10 post infection. Results: We found that male BALB/c mice that were exposed to plastic caging had increased myocarditis due to complement activation and elevated numbers of macrophages and neutrophils, whereas females had elevated mast cell activation and fibrosis. Conclusions: These findings show that housing mice in traditional plastic caging increases viral myocarditis in males and females, but using sex-specific immune mechanisms.","Bruno, Katelyn A.; Macomb, Logan P.; Morales-Lara, A.

Here, we describe the recombinant expression and purification of S2-E into amphipol-class amphipathic polymer solutions. The physical properties of amphipols underpin their ability to solubilize and stabilize membrane proteins without disrupting membranes. Amphipol delivery of S2-E to pre-formed planar bilayers results in spontaneous membrane integration and formation of viroporin ion channels. Amphipol delivery of the S2-E protein to human cells results in membrane integration followed by retrograde trafficking to a location adjacent to the endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the Golgi, which are the sites of coronavirus replication. Delivery of S2-E to cells enables both chemical biological approaches for future studies of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and development of “Trojan Horse” anti-viral therapies.

While inflammation has long been considered as a morbid phenomenon, John Hunter (18(th) century) and Elie Metchnikoff (19(th) century) understood that it was a natural and beneficial event that aims to address a sterile or an infectious insult.

In the present study, we characterized vulnerable populations located in areas at higher risk of COVID-19 related mortality and low critical healthcare capacity in the U.S. METHODS: Using Bayesian multilevel analysis and small area disease risk mapping, we assessed the spatial variation of COVID-19 related mortality risk for the U.S. in relation with healthcare disparities including race, ethnicity, poverty, air quality, and critical healthcare capacity. RESULTS: Overall, highly populated, regional air hub areas, and minorities had an increased risk of COVID-19 related mortality. We found that with an increase of only 1 ug/m3 in long term PM2.5 exposure, the COVID-19 mortality rate increased by 13%. Counties with major air hubs had 18% increase in COVID-19 related death compared to counties with no airport connectivity. Sixty-eight percent of the counties with high COVID-19 related mortality risk were also counties with lower critical care capacity than national average. These counties were primary located at the North- and South-Eastern regions of the country. CONCLUSION: The existing disparity in health and environmental risk factors that exacerbate the COVID-19 related mortality, along with the regional healthcare capacity, determine the vulnerability of populations to COVID-19 related mortality. The results from this study can be used to guide the development of strategies for the identification and targeting preventive strategies in vulnerable populations with a higher proportion of minority groups living in areas with poor air quality and low healthcare capacity.","Correa-Agudelo, Esteban; Mersha, Tesfaye B.; Hernández, Andrés; Branscum, Adam J.; MacKinnon, Neil J.; Cuadros, Diego F.",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32699858/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.11.20151563v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.11.20151563,133

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the relationship between ethnicity and clinical outcomes in COVID-19. METHODS: Databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PROSPERO, Cochrane library and MedRxiv) were searched up to 31st August 2020, for studies reporting COVID-19 data disaggregated by ethnicity. Outcomes were: risk of infection; intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission and death. PROSPERO ID: 180654. FINDINGS: 18,728,893 patients from 50 studies were included; 26 were peer-reviewed; 42 were from the United States of America and 8 from the United Kingdom. Individuals from Black and Asian ethnicities had a higher risk of COVID-19 infection compared to White individuals. This was consistent in both the main analysis (pooled adjusted RR for Black: 2.02, 95% CI 1.67–2.44; pooled adjusted RR for Asian: 1.50, 95% CI 1.24–1.83) and sensitivity analyses examining peer-reviewed studies only (pooled adjusted RR for Black: 1.85, 95%CI: 1.46–2.35; pooled adjusted RR for Asian: 1.51, 95% CI 1.22–1.88).

Pregnant women and patients taking anti-cancer drugs had been excluded from the study. Data from each institution's electronic medical record had been obtained. Results Sixty patients who had RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 were included in this study; of these patients, all of them had unknown exposure to COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 45.7 (13.5) years, and 42 were men (70%). Of these patients, 80% had at least ageusia or anosmia. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were cough (75%), fever (71.3%), myalgia or fatigue (53.3%), anosmia (loss of smell) (40%), ageusia (loss of taste) (28.3%), sore throat (25%), shortness of breath (16.7%), headache (16.7%), and GI symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and loss appetite) (16.7%). A total of 68.3% of COVID-19 infected patients had reported either loss of taste or smell, and about 33.3% of them had only loss of smell, while 23.3% of them had impaired taste, and 11.7% of COVID-19 infected patients had both taste and smell loss.

682758,Spatio-temporal spread of infectious pathogens of humans,2017-05-17,"BACKGROUND: Azithromycin, an antibiotic with potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, has been used to treat COVID-19, but evidence from community randomised trials is lacking. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of azithromycin to treat suspected COVID-19 among people in the community who had an increased risk of complications. METHODS: In this UK-based, primary care, open-label, multi-arm, adaptive platform randomised trial of interventions against COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course (PRINCIPLE), we randomly assigned people aged 65 years and older, or 50 years and older with at least one comorbidity, who had been unwell for 14 days or less with suspected COVID-19, to usual care plus azithromycin 500 mg daily for three days, usual care plus other interventions, or usual care alone. The trial had two coprimary endpoints measured within 28 days from randomisation: time to first self-reported recovery, analysed using a Bayesian piecewise exponential, and hospital admission or death related to COVID-19, analysed using a Bayesian logistic regression model. Eligible participants with outcome data were included in the primary analysis, and those who received the allocated treatment were included in the safety analysis. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN86534580. FINDINGS: The first participant was recruited to PRINCIPLE on April 2, 2020. The azithromycin group enrolled participants between May 22 and Nov 30, 2020, by which time 2265 participants had been randomly assigned, 540 to azithromycin plus usual care, 875 to usual care alone, and 850 to other interventions. 2120 (94%) of 2265 participants provided follow-up data and were included in the Bayesian primary analysis, 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group, 823 in the usual care alone group, and 797 in other intervention groups. 402 (80%) of 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group and 631 (77%) of 823 participants in the usual care alone group reported feeling recovered within 28 days. We found little evidence of a meaningful benefit in the azithromycin plus usual care group in time to first reported recovery versus usual care alone (hazard ratio 1·08, 95% Bayesian credibility interval [BCI] 0·95 to 1·23), equating to an estimated benefit in median time to first recovery of 0·94 days (95% BCI −0·56 to 2·43). The probability that there was a clinically meaningful benefit of at least 1·5 days in time to recovery was 0·23. 16 (3%) of 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group and 28 (3%) of 823 participants in the usual care alone group were hospitalised (absolute benefit in percentage 0·3%, 95% BCI −1·7 to 2·2). There were no deaths in either study group. Safety outcomes were similar in both groups. Two (1%) of 455 participants in the azothromycin plus usual care group and four (1%) of 668 participants in the usual care alone group reported admission to hospital during the trial, not related to COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Our findings do not justify the routine use of azithromycin for reducing time to recovery or risk of hospitalisation for people with suspected COVID-19 in the community. These findings have important antibiotic stewardship implications during this pandemic, as inappropriate use of antibiotics leads to increased antimicrobial resistance, and there is evidence that azithromycin use increased during the pandemic in the UK.

In the literature, cutaneous symptoms associated with the disease are generally emphasized. However, there are very few studies on the effect of this new SARS‐CoV‐2 virus entering our lives on dermatological diseases, and none of them have used the dermatological quality of life index (DLQI). In our study, we aimed to evaluate the difficulties faced by the patients who applied to the dermatology outpatient clinic during the pandemic period and the course of their diseases with the dermatological quality of life index. The study was carried out prospectively by including dermatology patients who will apply to the outpatient clinic in June‐July 2020. 282 patients were evaluated in the study. DLQI was significantly lower in the group using regular emollients (P < .001). When DLQI was compared between disease groups, it was found to be significantly different (P: .017). DLQI was found to worsen significantly compared to prepandemic studies.

Psychological distress may lead to reduced performance, reduced employability or even burnout. In the present study, we assessed experienced psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic from a self-determination theory perspective. METHODS: This mixed-methods study, with repeated measures, used surveys (quantitative data) combined with audio diaries (qualitative data) to assess work-related COVID-19 experiences, psychological need satisfaction and frustration, and psychological distress over time. Forty-six participants (nurses, junior doctors, and consultants) completed 259 surveys and shared 60 audio diaries. Surveys and audio diaries were analysed separately. RESULTS: Quantitative results indicated that perceived psychological distress during COVID-19 was higher than pre-COVID-19 and fluctuated over time. Need frustration, specifically autonomy and competence, was positively associated with psychological distress, while need satisfaction, especially relatedness, was negatively associated with psychological distress. In the qualitative, thematic analysis, we observed that especially organisational logistics (rostering, work-life balance, and internal communication) frustrated autonomy, and unfamiliarity with COVID-19 frustrated competence. Despite many need frustrating experiences, a strong connection with colleagues and patients were important sources of relatedness support (i.e. need satisfaction) that seemed to mitigate psychological distress. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increase of psychological distress among frontline workers. Both need frustration and need satisfaction explained unique variance of psychological distress, but seemed to originate from different sources. Challenging times require healthcare organisations to better support their professionals by tailored formal and informal support. We propose to address both indirect (e.g. organisation) and direct (e.g. colleagues) elements of the clinical and social environment in order to reduce need frustration and enhance need satisfaction.","van der Goot, Wieke E.; Duvivier, Robbert J.; Van Yperen, Nico W.; de Carvalho-Filho, Marco A.; Noot, Kirsten E.; Ikink, Renee; Gans, Rijk O.

684491,Virtual infection prevention—The next frontier,2021-01-05,"Abstract The Paramyxoviridae include some of the great and ubiquitous disease-causing viruses of humans and animals. In most paramyxoviruses, two viral membrane glycoproteins, fusion protein (F) and receptor binding protein (HN, H or G) mediate a concerted process of recognition of host cell surface molecules followed by fusion of viral and cellular membranes, resulting in viral nucleocapsid entry into the cytoplasm. The interactions between the F and HN, H or G viral glycoproteins and host molecules are critical in determining host range, virulence and spread of these viruses. Recently, atomic structures, together with biochemical and biophysical studies, have provided major insights into how these two viral glycoproteins successfully interact with host receptors on cellular membranes and initiate the membrane fusion process to gain entry into cells. These studies highlight the conserved core mechanisms of paramyxovirus entry that provide the fundamental basis for rational anti-viral drug design and vaccine development.","Bose, Sayantan; Jardetzky, Theodore S.; Lamb, Robert A.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25771804/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.02.037; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682215000835; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215000835,133
684518,Rapid Adoption of Video Visits and Return-to-Clinic Procedures to Maintain Access to Allergy/Immunology Care Delivery During COVID-19,2021-02-28,"Abstract Background The current global pandemic has impacted heavily on health systems, making unprecedented demands on resources, and forcing reconfiguration of services. Trauma and orthopaedic units have cancelled elective surgery, moved to virtual based clinics and have been forced to reconsider the provision of trauma. Our national elective orthopaedic centre has been re-designated as a trauma centre to allow tertiary centres re-direct triaged trauma. Many governments, as part of their COVID-19 management, have significantly restricted activity of the general population. We proposed that trauma patterns would change alongside these changes and maintaining existing standards of treatment would require dedicated planning and structures. Methods Referrals over a six-week period (March 15th – April 30th) were retrospectively reviewed. Data was collected directly from our referral database and a database populated. Analysis was performed to assess trauma volume, aetiology, and changes in trends. Results There were one hundred and fifty-nine referrals from three individual hospitals within the timeframe. Mean age of patient’s referred was 55 (range17-92). Males accounted for 45% of cases. F&A injuries were the most common (32%), followed by H&W (28%), UL (17%), H&F (16%) and K&T (7%). In comparison to the corresponding time-period in 2019, trauma theatre activity reduced by almost one half (45.3%) Conclusion The majority of trauma referred to our Dublin based centre during COVID-19 related population restrictions appears to be home based and trauma volumes have decreased. Significant reductions are apparent in work and sport related injuries suggestive of compliance with COVID-19 activity guidelines. Maintaining existing standards of treatment requires dedicated planning.","Staunton, Peter; Gibbons, John P.; Keogh, Peter; Curtin, Paul; Cashman, James P.; O’Byrne, John",The Surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2020.08.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1479666X20301153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32893129/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1479666X20301153?v=s5,133
684722,SARS-CoV-2 and Tacrolimus Blood Concentration in Kidney Transplant Recipients,2021-07-15,"BACKGROUND: Statins are widely used to treat people with metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. The effect of statins on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. To investigate the association between statins and COVID-19 outcomes and, if possible, identify the subgroup population that benefits most from statin use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies that included statin users and described COVID-19 outcomes through 10 November 2020. This study used the generic inverse variance method to perform meta-analyses with random-effects modelling. The main outcomes were evaluation of the need for invasive mechanical ventilator (IMV) support, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) care and death. All outcomes were measured as dichotomous variables. RESULTS: A total of 28 observational studies, covering data from 63,537 individuals with COVID-19, were included. The use of statins was significantly associated with decreased mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55–0.92, I(2)=72%) and the need for IMV (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69–0.95, I(2)=0%) but was not linked to the need for ICU care (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.55–1.51, I(2)=66%). Subgroup analysis further identified five types of studies in which statin users had even lower odds of death. CONCLUSIONS: The use of statins was significantly associated with a reduced need for IMV and decreased mortality among individuals with COVID-19. Statins may not need to be discontinued because of concern for COVID-19 on admission. Further randomized controlled trial (RCTs) are needed to clarify the causal effect between statin use and severe COVID-19 outcomes. KEY MESSAGES: Participants in five types of studies were shown to have even lower odds of death when taking statins. The use of statins was significantly associated with a reduced need for invasive mechanical ventilation and decreased all-cause mortality among individuals with COVID-19. However, statin use did not prevent participants from needing care in the intensive care unit. The results justify performing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to validate the benefits of statins on COVID-19 outcomes.","Wu, Kuan-Sheng; Lin, Pei-Chin; Chen, Yao-Shen; Pan, Tzu-Cheng; Tang, Pei-Ling",Annals of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2021.1933165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34096808/,133
684987,Newborn Dried Blood Spots for Serologic Surveys of COVID-19,2020-10-22,"With the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the strict implementation of quarantine policy, the levels of anxiety among university students surged in the lockdown period. Previous studies confirmed the effectiveness of social support in mitigating anxiety, so offering social support should be of high priority in COVID-19, especially in quarantine. However, various coping strategies against the pandemic may explain the link between social support and anxiety. The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations of social support, coping strategy against COVID-19, and anxiety, identifying the potential mediating effect of coping strategy between social support and anxiety during the COVID-19 quarantine. Home-quarantined Chinese university students (N = 2640; 68.79% female) completed online ratings of social support, coping, and anxiety from February 21st to 24th, 2020, when they had been confined to their homes in the peak of the pandemic. Sex and academic attainment being covariates, path analysis with parallel mediation were conducted using “lavaan” package in R environment. Anxiety was significantly negatively related to subjective support and counselor support, while family support did not demonstrate substantive associations with anxiety. The mediating role of cognitive coping was found between all the three social support sources and anxiety. Emotional coping and behavioral coping were found to partially mediate the relationship between subjective support and anxiety, fully mediate the associations of family support and anxiety. However, the impact of counselor support on anxiety was not found to be mediated by emotional coping and behavioral coping. This large-scale online study provides initial evidence that various coping strategies may mediate the relationship between three sources of social support and anxiety in quarantine to some extent. Given that coping against COVID-19 is a valuable reasearch goal upon the global ongoing challenge, the findings will shed more light on the mechanism in the link between coping, social support, and anxiety.","Li, Yue; Peng, Jun; Tao, Yanqiang",Curr Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34629830/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02334-x,133

The nature of the way the virus spreads causes cases to come in further recurring waves. This is due a complex array of biological, societal and environmental factors, including the novel nature of the emerging pathogen. Other parameters explaining the epidemic trend consisting of recurring waves are logistic–organizational challenges in the implementation of the vaccine roll-out, scarcity of doses and human resources, seasonality, meteorological drivers, and community heterogeneity, as well as cycles of strengthening and easing/lifting of the mitigation interventions. Therefore, it is crucial to be able to have an early alert system to identify when another wave of cases is about to occur. The availability of a variety of newly developed indicators allows for the exploration of multi-feature prediction models for case data. Ten indicators were selected as features for our prediction model. The model chosen is a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory. This paper documents the development of an early alert/detection system that functions by predicting future daily confirmed cases based on a series of features that include mobility and stringency indices, and epidemiological parameters.

This meta-analysis aimed to explore the prevalence of sleep disturbances and sleep quality in Chinese HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: English (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) and Chinese databases (WanFang, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and SinoMed) were systematically and independently searched for relevant studies published from December 1, 2019, to May 20, 2020. The pooled prevalence of sleep disturbances and sleep quality were calculated using a random-effects model. Results: A total of 17 studies involving 12,682 Chinese HWs were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of sleep disturbances in Chinese HWs was 45.1% (95% CI: 37.2–53.1%). We found that the prevalence of sleep disturbances varied among frontline, infected, and non-frontline HWs (Q = 96.96, p < 0.001); females and males (Q = 9.10, p = 0.003); studies using different assessment instruments (Q = 96.05, p < 0.001); and studies with different sample sizes (Q = 5.77, p = 0.016) and cut-off values (Q = 62.28, p < 0.001). The pooled mean total score of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was 9.83 (95% CI: 8.61–11.04). HWs in Wuhan had a higher total PSQI score than those in other regions (Q = 9.21, p = 0.002). Conclusion: Sleep disturbances were common in Chinese HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in frontline and infected HWs. Our results indicate the heavy mental health burden on HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in China and can provide other countries with valuable information to assist HWs during the crisis.","Xia, Lei; Chen, Changhao; Liu, Zhiqiang; Luo, Xiangfen; Guo, Chunyan; Liu, Zhiwei; Zhang, Kai; Liu, Huanzhong",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33679493/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.646342,133

The identification of risk factors on progression to the severity stages is essential in providing more efficient and suitable management to COVID-19 patients. However, there is insufficient study on risk factors for severity stages of COVID-19 patients. In this study, 2959 confirmed COVID-19 patients were analyzed while using national data, COVID-19 patients Clinical Epidemiological Information provided from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. The epidemiological variable, hospital room, periods from confirmation to release, initial symptom and vital signs, underlying comorbidities, and initial blood variables were used to verify the relation with progression to severity stages of COVID-19 and severe COVID-19. The chi-square test, welch test, multiple regression and logistic regression analysis were performed. The ICU (Intensive Care Unit) admission rate of patients having characteristics, such as older age, male, abnormal BMI (Body Mass Index), high heart rate, high body temperature, fever, cough, sputum, sore throat, rhinorrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, change of consciousness, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic artery disease, chronic kidney disease, cancer, dementia, abnormal hemoglobin, abnormal hematocrit, abnormal lymphocyte, abnormal platelets, and abnormal white blood cell were high. The risk factors for severe COVID-19 were older age, shorter hospitalization, abnormal lymphocyte, abnormal platelets, dyspnea, change of consciousness, and dementia. Whereas, significant predictors for progression to severity stages of COVID-19 were older age, longer period from confirmation to release, higher BMI, higher body temperature, abnormal lymphocyte, abnormal platelets, fever, no sore throat, dyspnea, no headache, COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), and dementia.

This paper presents an analysis of the extent to which the economic shocks of mandatory closures to mitigate the pandemic ripple through the world economy. We utilize a state-of-the-art computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to analyze these interconnections through international trade. We compare estimates of the impacts on US GDP in isolation and then examine the impacts taking into account US trade with China and the rest of the world (ROW). Our analysis indicates that these international trade linkage impacts are generally negative and range from near zero to very large overall, depending on the region, and that own- and cross-country impacts differ by region as well. At the same time, we find that China is able to capitalize on the situation by actually being able to increase its exports through international trade following mandatory closures in other regions. We also confirm that the US economy was relatively insulated from trade linkages with the rest of the world. Sectoral impacts provide further insight into the results.","Rose, Adam; Walmsley, Terrie; Wei, Dan",Lett Spat Resour Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12076-021-00271-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394760/,133
688972,Advancing the global health security agenda in light of the 2015 annual Hajj pilgrimage and other mass gatherings,2015-10-09,"RATIONALE: Opioids are effective medications, but they have several key limitations including the development of tolerance, establishment of dependence, diversion for non-medical use, and the development of addiction. Therefore, any drugs which act in an additive or synergistic fashion with opioids to address medical applications have the potential to reduce opioid-related harms. OBJECTIVES: To determine if heroin and Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) interact in an additive or independent manner to alter nociception, body temperature, and spontaneous locomotor activity when inhaled or injected. METHODS: Groups of female and male rats, implanted with radiotelemetry transmitters, were exposed to vapor generated from heroin (50 mg/mL in propylene glycol vehicle; PG), THC (50 mg/mL), or the combination for assessment of effects on temperature and activity. Thermal nociception was assessed with a warm water tail-withdrawal assay. RESULTS: Heroin inhalation increased temperature and activity whereas THC inhalation decreased temperature and activity in both female and male Sprague–Dawley rats. Effects of combined inhalation were in opposition, and additional experiments found the same outcome for the injection of heroin (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) and THC (10 mg/kg, i.p.) alone and in combination. In contrast, the co-administration of heroin and THC by either inhalation or injection produced additive effects on thermal nociception in both male and female Sprague–Dawley and Wistar rats. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that additive effects of THC with an opioid on a medical endpoint such as analgesia may not generalize to other behavioral or physiological effects, which may be a positive outcome for unwanted side effects.","Gutierrez, Arnold; Nguyen, Jacques D.; Creehan, Kevin M.; Javadi-Paydar, Mehrak; Grant, Yanabel; Taffe, Michael A.",Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34160641/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-021-05904-w,133

And it is meaningful to evaluate the potential health impacts of air quality changes during the lockdown, especially for PM(2.5) with adverse health effects. In this study, by using PM(2.5) observations from 1388 monitoring stations nationwide in China, we examine the PM(2.5) variations between the COVID-19 lockdown (February and March in 2020) and the same period in 2015-2019, and find that the national average of PM(2.5) decreases by 18 μg m(−3), and mean PM(2.5) for most sites (about 75%) decrease by 30%-60%. The anthropogenic and meteorological contributions to these PM(2.5) variations are also determined by using a stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) model combined with the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter. Our results show that the change of anthropogenic emissions is a leading contributor to those widespread PM(2.5) reductions, and meteorological conditions have the negative influence on PM(2.5) reductions for some regions, such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH). Additionally, the avoided premature death due to PM(2.5) reduction is estimated as a predicted number based on a log-linear concentration-response function. The total avoided premature death is 9952 in China, with dominant contribution (94%) from anthropogenic emission changes. For BTH, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta and Hubei regions, the reductions of PM(2.5) are 24.1, 24.3, 13.5 and 29.5 μg m(−3), with the avoided premature deaths of 1066, 1963, 454 and 583, respectively.","Bai, Heming; Gao, Wenkang; Zhang, Yuanpeng; Wang, Li",J Environ Sci (China),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1001074221000255; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001074221000255?v=s5,133

We aimed to analyze the spatiotemporal spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan and its influence factors. Information of 32,682 COVID-19 cases reported through March 18 were extracted from the national infectious disease surveillance system. Geographic information system methods were applied to analysis transmission of COVID-19 and its influence factors in different periods. We found decrease in effective reproduction number (Rt) and COVID-19 related indicators through taking a series of effective public health measures including restricting traffic, centralized quarantine and strict stay-at home policy. The distribution of COVID-19 cases number in Wuhan showed obvious global aggregation and local aggregation. In addition, the analysis at streets-level suggested population density and the number of hospitals were associated with COVID-19 cases number. The epidemic situation showed obvious global and local spatial aggregations. High population density with larger number of hospitals may account for the aggregations. The epidemic in Wuhan was under control in a short time after strong quarantine measures and restrictions on movement of residents were implanted.","Liu, Wei; Wang, Dongming; Hua, Shuiqiong; Xie, Cong; Wang, Bin; Qiu, Weihong; Xu, Tao; Ye, Zi; Yu, Linling; Yang, Meng; Xiao, Yang; Feng, Xiaobing; Shi, Tingming; Li, Mingyan; Chen, Weihong",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34211038/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93020-2,133
